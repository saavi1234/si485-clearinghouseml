    "summary": "<p>This is a putative class action about excessive police force used to disperse protestors of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). On November 20, 2016, the plaintiffs&ndash; Native Americans and other concerned citizens who referred to themselves as \"water protectors\"--gathered to pray and protest the DAPL at Backwater Bridge in North Dakota. They were met by local police forces who were armed with specialty impact munitions, teargas, and water cannons. Without warning, the police began to use force to disperse the crowd, injuring over 200 demonstrators in the process. Police also arrested approximately 100 people who were peacefully protesting or were engaged in prayer ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed their complaint in the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota on November 28, 2016. The plaintiffs sought to represent a class of similarly situated protestors, but class certification was never granted. The case was initially assigned to Chief Judge Daniel L. Hovland. The plaintiffs brought this action against Morton County, North Dakota and their Sheriff's Department; Stutsman County, North Dakota and their Sheriff's Department; and the City of Mandan, North Dakota. They also included 100 unnamed individual law enforcement officers as defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1981 and &sect;1983. The plaintiffs asserted violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments in the form of retaliation for constitutionally protected activities, unreasonable use of force, unconstitutional policing policies by the defendant agencies, and unequal protection under the law. They also included state law claims for assault and battery as well as negligence by the defendants against all members of the class.The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief declaring the defendants&rsquo; actions unlawful and enjoining them from using the same methods of crowd dispersal in the future. The case was assigned to Judge Daniel L. Hovland.</p>\r\n<p>The same day the lawsuit began, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief. The plaintiffs requested an order prohibiting the defendants from using excessive force in responding to the pipeline protests and prohibiting the use of specialty impact munitions, explosive grenades, chemical agents, sound cannons, directed energy devices, and water cannons or hoses, as a means of crowd dispersal. The court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a temporary restraining order on December 1, 2016, and denied their motion for a preliminary injunction approximately three months later. Judge Hovland denied both motions because the plaintiffs failed to certify in writing that they had made efforts to notify the defendants as required by FRCP 65(B)(1)(b).</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2017, the court stayed proceedings as the plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit regarding the district court&rsquo;s denial of a preliminary injunction. That stay was lifted on January 10, 2018, after the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court&rsquo;s denial in a cursory per curiam opinion. 701 Fed.Appx. 538. The court found that there was not an abuse of discretion by Judge Hovland and agreed with his finding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 27, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint containing information about government actions relating to the DAPL subsequent to their initial filing. The plaintiffs alleged that approximately three months after the first complaint, the defendants again engaged with protestors and injured them with water cannons and specialty impact munitions. The first amended complaint also included the addition of state law claims against the defendants for assault and battery and negligence.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants initially filed a motion to dismiss on April 6, 2018. Two years later, this case was reassigned to Judge Daniel Traynor, who converted the defendant&rsquo;s motion to one for summary judgment on September 10, 2020 in order to allow time for discovery. The defendants then filed an interlocutory appeal to the Eighth Circuit, arguing that the district court erred by refusing to rule on whether the officials were protected by qualified immunity. That appeal was dismissed by the Eighth Circuit for lack of jurisdiction. 2020 WL 9211289.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2021, Judge Traynor granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment. Regarding the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourth Amendment claim, the court found that no seizure occurred because the plaintiffs were free to leave and were not being herded in any particular direction. In the alternative, the court also held that the officers would have been protected by qualified immunity. The court also found the plaintiffs&rsquo; excessive force and state law claims to be without merit, as the officers&rsquo; actions were objectively reasonable; again the court concluded in the alternative that the officers would have been shielded by qualified immunity. Finally, because the court found that the officers did not act because of any of the plaintiffs&rsquo; political or religious beliefs, it concluded that the plaintiffs&rsquo; remaining Equal Protection Clause and First Amendment claims were without merit. 577 F.Supp.3d 1007.</p>\r\n<p>On January 28, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Eighth Circuit.&nbsp;On appeal, the plaintiffs sought to reinstate: their &sect; 1983 claims against individual officers for using excessive force in violation of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, their claim against the municipalities for enacting unconstitutional policies, and their claim against the Morton County Sheriff, Stutsman County Sheriff, and City of Mandan Chief of Police for supervisory liability. The case was heard by Judge Steven M. Colloton, Judge Roger L. Wollman, and Judge Duane Benton.</p>\r\n<p>On November 3, 2023, in an opinion written by Judge Colloton, the Eighth Circuit unanimously affirmed the lower court&rsquo;s decision. The court rejected the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, finding that it was not clearly established at the time of the incident that using force to disperse a crowd constituted a seizure. Since it was not clearly established that the officers&rsquo; use of force to disperse protestors violated a constitutional right, the court reasoned that the municipalities&rsquo; decision not to train their officers on protester dispersal did not constitute deliberate indifference. The court also found that the municipalities&rsquo; policies allowing officer discretion on when and how to use force were facially lawful. Finally, the court determined that the named Sheriffs and Chief of Police were not liable as supervisors because there was insufficient evidence of deliberate supervisor indifference, particularly since the alleged constitutional right was not clearly established.</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

Doc. No. 135. The Plaintiffs2 filed a \nResponse in Opposition on April 27, 2018. Doc. No. 137. In the alternative, the Plaintiffs filed a \nMotion to Conduct Discovery pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). Doc. No. 139.  \n \n1 The term “Defendants” refers collectively to Kyle Kirchmeier, Morton County, City of Mandan, \nJason Ziegler, Stutsman County, and Chad Kaiser.  \n2 The term “Plaintiffs” refers collectively to Vanessa Dundon, Jade Kalikolehuaokalani Wool, \nCrystal Wilson, David Demo, Guy Dullknife, III, Mariah Marie Bruce, Frank Finan, Israel \nHoagland-Lynn, and Noah Michael Treanor. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 2 of 13\nThe Defendants filed a Reply in Support of the Motion to Dismiss on May 18, 2018. Doc. No. 143. \nFor the reasons explained below, the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint is \nconverted into a Motion for Summary Judgment and the Court will DEFER RULING on the \nsame. For the same reasons, the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Conduct Discovery Pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 56(d) is GRANTED. Because the Court is fully apprised of the issues and finds \na hearing is unnecessary, the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Hearing is DENIED AS MOOT. \nBACKGROUND \n[¶2]  On November 28, 2016, the Plaintiffs filed a Complaint asserting claims against all \nDefendants for (1) Retaliation under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) Unreasonable Use of Force under the Fourth and \nFourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution;  42  U.S.C.  §  1983;  (3) \n[Unconstitutional]  Policies,  Customs,  or  Practices  under  the  First,  Fourth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (4) [Violations Resulting from] \nTraining, Supervision, or Discipline under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (5) Unequal Protection of the Law under the First, \nFourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; and (6) Declaratory Relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2201. Doc. No. 1.  \n[¶3]  That same day, the Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction, seeking:  \nan emergency order enjoining Defendants from curtailing their First and Fourth \nAmendment  rights  by  using  highly  dangerous  weaponry,  including  Specialty \nImpact  Munitions  (SIM,  also  known  as  Kinetic  Impact  Projectiles  or  KIP), \nexplosive “blast” grenades, other chemical agent devices, and a water cannon and \nwater hoses in freezing temperatures, to quell protests and prayer ceremonies \nassociated with opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 3 of 13\nDoc. No. 14, p. 1; see also Doc. Nos. 2, 13. The Plaintiffs submitted twenty (20) exhibits in support \nof this Motion. Doc. Nos. 14-1 – 14-20. These included a Washington Post article titled, “The \nLatest: Sheriff defends spraying protestors with water”; a press release from the Morton County \nSheriff’s Department titled “Protestors erect unlawful structures; should seek appropriate winter \nshelter,”; seventeen (17) declarations from individuals, including the named-Plaintiffs; and a \nReport by the Physicians for Human Rights titled “Lethal in Disguise: The health consequences \nof crowd-control weapons.” Id.  \n[¶4]  On December 1, 2016, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder on the basis the Plaintiffs’ counsel failed to comply with notice requirements under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(1) in that the Plaintiffs failed (1) to certify in writing they made \nefforts to give the Defendants notice, and (2) to provide reasons justifying why notice to the \nDefendants was not warranted. Doc. No. 16, p. 2. The Court noted because the matter “is clearly \na fact-specific case . . . notice to the adverse parties and an opportunity for them to respond and be \nheard is necessary.” Doc. No. 16, p. 2. The Court ordered that the Defendants file a Response to \nthe Motion for Preliminary Injunction within fourteen (14) days after the Plaintiffs served them \nwith the Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, its brief, and supporting documents. Doc. \nNo. 16, p. 2.  \n[¶5]  The same day, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Reconsider the Order Denying the \nTemporary Restraining Order, asserting they complied with the notice requirements of Rule \n65(b)(1).  Doc. No. 17. They also noted they did not seek the issuance of an ex parte Order. Id. On \nDecember 8, 2016, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration, noting “the Court \nfinds that notice to the adverse parties and an opportunity to respond and be heard is necessary.” \nDoc. No. 31, p. 2 (emphasis in original).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 4 of 13\n[¶6]  On December 22, 2016, the Defendants submitted their Response to the Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction. Doc. No. 42. In support of the Response in Opposition, the Defendants \nattached numerous exhibits, including a map of the area in question, news releases, an emergency \ndeclaration by the Morton County Commissioners, criminal complaints, correspondence between \nofficials, releases from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, an Executive Order by the \nPresident, and affidavits of law enforcement involved in the matter. Doc. Nos. 47, 61-1 – 61-11. \nThe Plaintiffs filed their Reply Brief on January 23, 2017, attaching an additional twenty-nine (29) \ndeclarations of individuals, video clips of the November 20, 2016, incident, and information \npertaining to crowd control policies. Doc. Nos. 81, 86, 91, 94. In the interim, on February 6, 2017, \nthe Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. Doc. No. 97.  \n[¶7]  On February 7, 2017, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nDoc. No. 99. The next day, the Plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal of the Order Denying the \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. Doc. No. 102. On February 17, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a \nMotion to Stay Proceedings Pending Interlocutory Appeal, which included staying the Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss and their pending Response in Opposition. Doc. No. 106. On February 22, \n2017, the Court granted the Motion to Stay Proceedings. Doc. No. 110. On November 14, 2017, \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this Court’s denial of the Preliminary Injunction. \nDoc. Nos. 111-112.  \n[¶8]  This Court entered an Order Lifting the Stay on January 10, 2018. Doc. No. 113. The \nCourt ordered the Plaintiffs to respond to the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Complaint by \nFebruary 28, 2018. Doc. No. 113. However, the Plaintiffs requested the Court first consider their \nMotion for Leave to Amend the Complaint filed on February 1, 2018, as it would render the \nDefendants’ Motion moot if granted. The Court granted the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 5 of 13\nComplaint on February 27, 2018, finding as moot the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. Doc. No. \n128. The Plaintiffs’ filed a First Amended Complaint the same day. See Doc. Nos. 128-129.  \n[¶9]  The Amended Complaint alleges claims against all Defendants for: (1)[Violations of] the \nFirst Amendment (42 U.S.C. 1983); (2) Unreasonable Use of Force (Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitutions; 42 U.S.C. § 1983); (3) Unequal Protection of Law; (4) \nDeclaratory Relief (28 U.S.C. § 2201); (5) Assault and Battery; and (6) Negligence. Doc. No. 129, \n¶¶151-177. The Plaintiffs also assert additional claims of (7) [Unconstitutional] Policies, Customs, \nor Practices under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, and (8) [Violations Resulting from] Training, Supervision, or Discipline under \nthe First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nDoc. No. 129, ¶¶141-150.  \n[¶10]  The Defendants filed this Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint on April 6, 2018. \nDoc. No. 135. As part of its request for dismissal, the Defendants ask the Court to consider matters \noutside of the Amended Complaint, but which appear in the record, without converting the Motion \nto Dismiss into a Motion for Summary Judgment. Id.  The Plaintiffs respond that many of the items \nthe Defendants request the Court to consider are not proper on a Motion to Dismiss, but request if \nthe Court does consider these additional items and converts the Motion to Dismiss into a Motion \nfor Summary Judgment that they be given an opportunity to conduct discovery pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 56(d). Doc. No. 137.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n[¶11]  Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a pleading must contain \na “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 8(a)(2).  Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates the dismissal of a \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 6 of 13\nclaim if there has been a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. When considering \na motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations \nin the complaint as true. Detailed factual allegations are not necessary under the Rule 8 pleading \nstandard, rather a plaintiff must set forth grounds of its entitlement to relief which “requires more \nthan labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not \ndo.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A complaint does not “suffice if it \ntenders ‘naked assertions’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’”  Aschcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). The determination of whether a complaint \nstates a claim upon which relief can be granted is a “context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”  Id. at 679. The court must \nconsider whether the allegations set forth in the complaint “plausibly give rise to an entitlement to \nrelief.”  Id. at 679. Dismissal will not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt the plaintiff can \nprove no set of facts entitling him to relief.  Ulrich v. Pope Cty., 715 F.3d 1054, 1058 (8th Cir. \n2013). \n[¶12]  The court may generally only look to the allegations contained in the complaint to make \na Rule 12(b)(6) determination.  McAuley v. Fed. Ins. Co., 500 F.3d 784, 787 (8th Cir. 2007).  “[I]n \nconsidering a motion to dismiss, the district court may sometimes consider materials outside the \npleadings, such as materials that are necessarily embraced by the pleadings and exhibits attached \nto the complaint.”  Mattes v. ABC Plastics, Inc., 323 F.3d 695, 697 n.4 (8th Cir. 2003) (citing \nPorous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp., 186 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir. 1999)).  However, if “matters \noutside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated \nas one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Upon conversion to a motion \nfor summary judgment, “[a]ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 7 of 13\nmaterial that is pertinent to the motion.”  Id.; Brooks v. Midwest Heart Grp., 655 F.3d 796, 800 \n(8th Cir. 2011).    \n[¶13]  Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable \nto the non-moving party, indicates no genuine issues of material fact exist and that the moving \nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Davison v. City of Minneapolis, Minn., 490 F.3d \n648, 654 (8th Cir. 2007); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  Summary judgment is not appropriate if there \nare factual disputes that may affect the outcome of the case under the applicable substantive law.  \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  An issue of material fact is genuine \nif the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party.  Id. \n[¶14]  The Court must inquire whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to \nrequire the submission of the case to a jury or whether the evidence is so one-sided that one party \nmust prevail as a matter of law.  Diesel Mach., Inc. v. B.R. Lee Indus., Inc., 418 F.3d 820, 832 \n(8th Cir. 2005).  The moving party bears the responsibility of informing the court of the basis for \nthe motion and identifying the portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact.  Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1042 (8th Cir. 2011).  The \nnon-moving party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its \nresponse must set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.  Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).  \nThe court must consider the substantive standard of proof when ruling on a motion for summary \njudgment.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.  \nLEGAL DISCUSSION \n1.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint  \n \n[¶15]  The Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint in this matter on February 27, 2018. Doc. \nNo. 129. In lieu of an Answer, the Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss the Amended \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 8 of 13\nComplaint on April 6, 2018. Doc. No. 135. The Defendants argue the Amended Complaint fails \nto state claims for relief, and in the event it does, the Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \nSee generally Doc. No. 136. In support of its Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants assert the Court \ncan rely upon facts embedded in previously filed documents and videos both parties submitted to \nthe Court in relation to the Plaintiffs’ previous Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction without converting its Motion to Dismiss into a Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  Doc.  No.  136,  pp.  3-17.  These  include  affidavits  of  law  enforcement  officers, \ndeclarations of protestors, and videos of the November 20, 2016 event in question, among other \ndocuments.  \n[¶16]  In its response to the Motion to Dismiss, the Plaintiffs contend the Court can only take \njudicial notice of those facts not in the Amended Complaint that are “not subject to reasonable \ndispute.” Doc. No. 137, p. 3. The Plaintiffs assert many of the facts the Defendants ask the Court \nto take judicial notice of are “subject to reasonable dispute, contradict the complaint, rely on \ndocuments such as press releases that are not the proper subject of judicial notice, and often \nmisrepresent the material cited.” Doc. No. 137, pp. 4-5. The Court agrees in some instances.  \n[¶17]  For example, the Defendants assert many of the facts outside of the Amended Complaint \nare those the Court can take judicial notice of pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b). Rule \n201(b) states the Court “may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute \nbecause it: (1) is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be \naccurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” \nFed. R. Evid. 201(b)(1)-(2). The Defendants assert twenty-three (23) facts fit this category.  \n[¶18]  For instance, the Defendants ask the Court to take judicial notice of the fact that the \n“bridge remained closed to all public access on November 20,” which would lend credence to their \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 9 of 13\nargument that the Plaintiffs were trespassing. Doc. No. 136, p. 7, ¶17. The Plaintiffs refute the \ntruth of this fact, noting the previously-filed press releases relied upon by the Defendants do not \nstate the Bridge was closed to “all access,” but rather they noted traffic was re-routed. Doc. No. \n137; see also Doc. Nos. 59-2, 59-3. The Plaintiffs assert they believed the Bridge was open to \npedestrian traffic, which they contend allowed them to lawfully exercise their First Amendment \nrights. Doc. No. 137. The parties clearly dispute if the Bridge was closed to the Plaintiffs on \nNovember 20, 2016, and the Court is not tasked at this stage with determining if the press releases \nweigh in favor of one interpretation over the other regarding the scope of the closure of the Bridge. \nThis fact is not appropriate for judicial notice. Along with asking the Court to take judicial notice \nof facts that are clearly subject to reasonable dispute, the Defendants also request the Court to take \njudicial notice of legal conclusions, which the Court refuses to do. See Doc. No. 136, p. 7, ¶15 \n(“The Bridge and Highway 1806 at the location of the November 20 events at issue were not \ntraditional public fora at any time prior to the DAPL protests, or during the protests.”).  \n[¶19]  While the Court could continue a detailed analysis of whether the remaining requested \ntwenty-one (21) facts are appropriate for judicial notice or if the numerous documents and videos \npreviously filed by both parties in relation to the Plaintiffs’ previous preliminary injunction motion \nfit into one of the acceptable categories of extrinsic evidence the Court may consider on a 12(b)(6) \nMotion, the Court finds it unnecessary to do so.  \n[¶20]  The Plaintiffs correctly point out that by citing to numerous matters outside of the \nAmended Complaint, the Defendants have placed the Court in such a position that it must convert \nthe Motion to Dismiss into a Motion for Summary Judgment. Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil procedure provides as follows: \nIf, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are \npresented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 10 of 13\nsummary  judgment  under  Rule  56.  All  parties  must  be  given  a  reasonable \nopportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (emphasis added).   \n[¶21]  However, summary judgment is only proper after the nonmovant has had an opportunity \nto conduct discovery.  Iverson v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., 172 F.3d 524, 530 (8th Cir. 1999).  \nIn this case, discovery has yet to begin. The Defendants filed their Motion prior to filing their \nAnswer. Instead, the Defendants are requesting the Court to find none of the Plaintiffs’ claims are \nviable based on self-serving documents the Defendants previously provided and documents the \nPlaintiffs  provided  in  support  of  a  different  motion  for  different  relief.  Granting  summary \njudgment without giving the Plaintiffs the opportunity to choose the evidence they present and \nconfining their evidentiary support to information they previously filed in connection with a \ndifferent motion is not appropriate in this case. On this basis, a ruling on the converted Motion for \nSummary Judgment will be deferred to allow the parties to conduct limited discovery pursuant to \nRule 56(d).  \n2.   Plaintiffs’ Request to Conduct Discovery  \n \n[¶22]  “Although discovery need not be complete before a case is dismissed . . . Rule 56[d] allows \na party to request a delay in granting summary judgment if the party can make a good faith showing \nthat postponement of the ruling would enable it to discover additional evidence which might rebut \nthe movant’s showing of the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Johnson v. Moody, 903 \nF.3d 766, 772 (8th Cir. 2018) (citing Robinson v. Terex Corp., 439 F.3d 465, 467 (8th Cir. 2006)). \n“To warrant time for additional discovery under Rule 56(d), the nonmovant must show: “(1) that \nthey have set forth in affidavit form the specific facts that they hope to elicit from further discovery, \n(2) that the facts sought exist, and (3) that these sought-after facts are ‘essential’ to resist the \nsummary judgment motion.” Id. (citation omitted). “Rule 56(d) does not condone a fishing \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 11 of 13\nexpedition  where  a  plaintiff  merely  hopes  to  uncover  some  possible  evidence  of  unlawful \nconduct.” Id.  \n[¶23]  “If a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration, that for specified reasons, it cannot \npresent facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or \ndeny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any \nother appropriate order.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d)(1)-(3). The purpose of this provision is to prevent \nthe unfair or premature grant of summary judgment and the rule is to be applied liberally.  Id.; U.S. \nex.rel. Bernard v. Casino Magic Corp., 293 F.3d 419, 426 (8th Cir. 2002). A court considering a \nRule  56(d)  motion  may  deny  summary  judgment,  grant  a  continuance,  or  make  any  other \nappropriate order. Fed. R. Civ. p. 56(d). \n[¶24]  The Plaintiffs’ counsel filed an “Affidavit in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion Pursuant to Rule \n56(d)” on April 27, 2018. Doc. No. 138. Counsel attests if the Court converts the Motion to Dismiss \ninto a Motion for Summary Judgment, the Plaintiffs will be “unable to present facts essential to \njustify their opposition to a motion for summary judgment, which would be an early filed motion \nin the absence of discovery.” Id. at p. 1. Counsel further attests through “interrogatories, requests \nfor production of documents, depositions, including Rule 30(b)(6) depositions, and third-party \nsubpoenas,”  the  following  discovery  may  be  retrieved  which  would  allow  the  Plaintiffs  to \nadequately respond to a Motion for Summary Judgment:  \nincluding related to the veracity and credibility of the currently untested averments \nin the declarations of individual law enforcement officers; the timing, duration and \ncharacter of any announcements or warnings issued by the police; the reach of any \nsuch warnings or announcements; the information in the possession of officers and \ncommand staff at the time decisions were made including the information flowing \ninto and out from the Joint Operations Command Center including any running \nresume, logs, digital feeds or other information; identification of officers who used \nforce and exploration as to law enforcement’s allegations of conduct by individuals \njustifying actions against all those assembled including at other times; exploration \nof allegations of conduct by the crowd as unit; the nature and extent of collaboration \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 12 of 13\nbetween the private unlicensed contractor TigerSwan and public law enforcement \nauthorities; information provided or created by TigerSwan influencing or used by \nlaw enforcement; infiltration and surveillance of water protectors by TigerSwan \nand/or law enforcement including whether provocative actions were undertaken by \npersons in either an undercover or plainclothed capacity; the propriety of use of \nforce, methods of force, and proper use of munitions; defendants’ policies and \npractices, training, supervision and/or discipline; the existence of intent to suppress \nspeech. \nDoc. No. 138, pp. 2-3.  \n[¶25]  The  Plaintiffs  have  provided  sufficient  information  to  warrant  conducting  limited \ndiscovery prior to the Court ruling on the merits of a Motion for Summary Judgment by the \nDefendants. The Court will also afford that same opportunity to the Defendants, who will be given \nthe opportunity to file supplemental material at the close of limited discovery pursuant to a \nforthcoming expedited and truncated briefing schedule. The Court understands the sensitive nature \nof this lawsuit for all involved, but it must also ensure neither side is subjected to an unbridled \nfishing expedition.  \n[¶26]  Accordingly, both parties shall provide to the Court, and serve upon the other, a detailed \nlist of the discovery each seeks. This includes a list of each individual to be deposed (not to exceed \nfive (5) persons or entities), a list of each third-party intended to be subpoenaed (not to exceed two \n(2) persons or entities), a list of each individual or entity (not to exceed five (5) individuals or \nentities, including named parties) to be served with interrogatories and production of document \nrequests (not exceed twelve (12) in total, including subparts), and a detailed list of any other \ndiscovery sought. This list shall be filed and served within seven (7) days of the date of this Order.  \n[¶27]  The Court will then review each submitted list and issue an Order outlining what discovery \nwill be permitted for each party. After the issuance of the limited discovery order, the Court will \nschedule a status conference with the parties to address the scheduling order in this matter as it \npertains to Motions for Summary Judgment and other pertinent deadlines.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 151   Filed 09/10/20   Page 13 of 13\nCONCLUSION \n[¶28]  This Court is cognizant that “[g]ranting [a] defendant’s motion to dismiss is ‘a harsh \nremedy which must be cautiously studied, not only to effectuate the spirit of the liberal rules of \npleading but also to protect the interests of justice.’” Cottrell, Ltd. v. Biotrol Int'l, Inc., 191 F.3d \n1248, 1251 (10th Cir. 1999). However, the Court also finds it a troublesome approach in this case \nto turn a blind-eye to information it was provided by both parties and has already reviewed and \nrelied upon previously in denying one of the parties injunctive relief. On this basis, the Court \nbelieves in order to adequately address the merits of this case, the Court must be able to consider \nthe evidence relevant to its adjudication. This requires converting the Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss into a Motion for Summary Judgment and deferring ruling on the same in order to allow \nthe parties to conduct limited discovery.   \n[¶29]  Accordingly, because ruling on the merits of a Motion for Summary Judgment in the \nabsence of the parties conducting discovery would be premature, a ruling on the Defendants’ \nMotion  to  Dismiss,  converted  into  a  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  [Doc.  No.  135],  is \nDEFERRED. For the same reasons, the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Conduct Discovery [Doc. No. 139] \nis GRANTED. Because the Court is fully apprised of the parties’ arguments and law on the issues, \nthe Plaintiffs’ Motion for Hearing [Doc. No. 144] is DENIED AS MOOT.  \n[¶30]  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDATED September 10, 2020.      \n \n                         \n            Daniel M. Traynor, District Judge \n            United States District Court \n \n13 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n  Before the Court is the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction filed on November 28, \n2016. See Docket No. 2.  The Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction pursuant to Rule 65 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically requesting an order prohibiting the Defendants from \nusing excessive force in responding to the pipeline protests and prohibiting the use of specialty impact \nmunitions (SIM), explosive grenades, chemical agents, sound cannons, directed energy devices, and \nwater cannons or hoses, as a means of crowd dispersal. See Docket Nos. 2 and 14.   \n  On November 28, 2016, the Plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting claims of declaratory and \ninjunctive relief; retaliation; unreasonable use of force; policies, customs, or practices; training, \nsupervision, or discipline; and unequal protection of the law. See Docket No. 1.  That same day, the \nPlaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction, \npursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Docket No. 2.  On December 1, \n2016, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO because Plaintiffs’ counsel failed to comply \nwith Rule 65(b)(1).  The Court gave the Defendants time to file a response to the Plaintiffs’ \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 2 of 35\npreliminary injunction motion. See Docket No. 16.  On December 1, 2016, the Plaintiffs moved the \nCourt to reconsider its order of December 1, 2016, denying the Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO. See \nDocket No. 17.  On December 8, 2016, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration. \nSee Docket No. 31.  On December 22, 2016, the Defendants filed a response in opposition to the \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. See Docket No. 42.  On January 23, 2017, the Plaintiffs \nfiled a reply. See Docket No. 81.  The Court conducted a telephone status conference with the parties \non January 26, 2017. See Docket No. 89.  Following that conference, both parties submitted videos \ndepicting the activities on the Backwater Bridge on November 20, 2016. See Docket Nos. 91 and 93. \nII. FACTS \n  During the course of the prolonged Dakota Access pipeline (“DAPL”) protest, the protesters \nhave primarily occupied three areas: the Sacred Stone Camp and the Rosebud Camp located south of \nthe Cannonball River, and the Seven Council Fires Camp (i.e. Oceti Sakowin) located between the \nnorth bank of the Cannonball River and the south bank of the North Branch of the Cantapeta Creek, \na tributary of the Cannonball River. The Sacred Stone Camp and Rosebud Camps are located in Sioux \nCounty, and the Seven Council Fires Camp is located in Morton County. The Backwater Bridge is \nlocated on Highway 1806 and crosses the north branch of the Cantapeta Creek, north of the Seven \nCouncil Fires Camp, as depicted in the map below: \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 3 of 35\n \nSee Docket No. 61-1. \n  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) manages the land upon which all three \ncamps are located.  The Corps also manages federal lands in Morton County located along the north \nbank of the North Branch of the Cantapeta Creek, extending from the Backwater Bridge and eastward \nto and along the north bank of the Cannonball River, eastward to the Missouri River. The Corps-\nmanaged land located along the north banks, as well as privately-owned property to the north, \nencompasses the DAPL project route and the location from which the DAPL project plans to cross \nthe Missouri River. The DAPL project route is located less than one-mile north of the Seven Council \nFires Camp.  \n  The Corps initially granted the protesters a permit to demonstrate on Corps-managed lands \nwhere the three camps are located. See Docket No. 61-9.  The permit pertaining to the Seven Council \nFires Camp has been terminated.  The Corps established a December 5, 2016, deadline for all persons \nto evacuate the Seven Council Fires Camp. See Docket No. 61-11.  The Corps has not granted anyone \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 4 of 35\npermits or permission with respect to public use of Corps-managed lands located north of the \nCantapeta Creek or north and east of the confluence of the Cantepeta Creek and Cannonball Rivers, \nextending to the Missouri River. See Docket No. 61-7.   \n  The protests in Morton County against the pipeline project began in April of 2016. A dramatic \nincrease in the number of people involved in the protests occurred in August 2016, when protesters \nbegan gathering in Morton County, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation.  This \nCourt first became involved in the activities of the DAPL protesters in August 2016, when Dakota \nAccess sought and obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order in federal court in a case entitled \nDakota Access, LLC v. Archambault, et al., Case No. 1:16-cv -296. In that civil action, and in response \nto the assertion the Court’s temporary restraining order had a chilling effect on the exercise of the \nprotesters rights to engage in the protected exercise of their constitutional rights, the undersigned said: \nWith respect to the assertion the movement has been a peaceful protest, one need \nonly turn on a television set or read any newspaper in North Dakota.  There the \nviewer will find countless videos and photographs of the “peaceful” protestors \nattaching  themselves  to  construction  equipment  operated  by  Dakota  Access; \nvandalizing and defacing construction equipment; trespassing on privately-owned \nproperty; obstructing work on the pipeline; and verbally taunting, harassing, and \nshowing disrespect to members of the law enforcement community.  The State of \nNorth Dakota has estimated the cost for law enforcement services to date at $2 \nmillion dollars.  The estimated damage to construction equipment and loss of work \non the project is far in excess of several million dollars.  The Morton County Sheriff \nreported that 22 protestors were arrested on September 13, 2016, just a few days \nago.  To suggest that all of the protest activities to date have been “peaceful” and \nlaw-abiding defies common sense and reality.  Nearly every day the citizens of \nNorth Dakota are inundated with images of “peaceful” protestors engaging in \nmindless and senseless criminal mayhem. \n \nThe Court fully recognizes the unlawful and violent protestors arrested to date \nconstitute  a  very  small  percentage  of  the  entire  entourage.    The  Court  also \nrecognizes that many of the troublesome “peaceful protestors” are from out-of-state \nwho have political interests in the pipeline protest and hidden agendas vastly \ndifferent and far removed from the legitimate interests of Native Americans of the \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe who are actually impacted by the pipeline project.  But \nfor anyone to suggest the protests have been entirely peaceful and prayerful is less \nthan forthright and ludicrous at best.   \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 5 of 35\nDakota Access, LLC v. Archambault, et al., No. 1:16-cv -296, Docket No. 45, pp. 3-4 (Sept. 26, \n2016). \n \nIII.  THE PROTESTERS’ VERSION OF EVENTS \nThe  Plaintiffs’  allegations  of  excessive  force  by  law  enforcement  officers  can  best  be \ncategorized as a riot that occurred on November 20, 2016, at the Backwater Bridge.  The Plaintiffs \ninitially submitted 17 declarations from protesters and others with personal knowledge of the events \nthat occurred on the Backwater Bridge on November 20, 2016. See Docket Nos. 14-3 through 14-19.   \n  The original set of 17 declarations filed in support of the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction reveal that on Sunday, November 20, 2016, the declarants (protesters) “went to the bridge \nimmediately north of Oceti Sakowin camp on Highway 1806 to peacefully protest and pray to stop \nthe pipeline from going through the river and polluting the Missouri River.” See Docket Nos. 14-4; \n14-5; 14-7 through 14-10; 14-12 through 14-17; 14-19.  The original declarations characterized the \nactions of law enforcement as aggressive and violent responses to the “peaceful and prayerful \nprotests,” which included the use of the following: \n  water cannons \n  tear gas \n  flash bang or concussion grenades \n  grenades \n  rubber bullets and/or beanbag projectiles \n  excessive force \n \n  None  of  the  original  17  declarations  mentioned  any  warnings  being  conveyed  by  law \nenforcement officers to the protesters to disperse, back away, and retreat from the Backwater Bridge; \nor to disengage and return to the south side of the bridge because they were trespassing on the \nBackwater Bridge located on Highway 1806.  None of the original 17 declarants made mention of \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 6 of 35\nany violent or criminal activity committed by “peaceful and prayerful” protesters on November 20, \n2016. \n  On January 23, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for injunctive relief \nand filed 29 additional declarations. See Docket Nos. 81; 81-1 through 81-29.  The following \ndeclarations are representative of the protesters’ observations of the chaotic events that occurred on \nNovember 20, 2016: \n  The declaration of Martyn Lenoble provides a detailed account of the November 20, 2016, \nincident, with photographs. See Docket No. 81-27.  Lenoble, a musician who lives in Los Angeles, \nwas preparing to leave Oceti Sakowin Camp on November 20, 2016, when he noticed a semi-truck \ntry to tow a burned out truck away from the police barricade.  There were not more than ten people \ninvolved.  The police remained behind the concrete barriers, the razor wire, and the armored vehicles.  \nAccording to Lenoble, additional officers quickly arrived and began shooting impact munitions and \nteargas canisters.  The first teargas canister started a fire in the brush.  The semi pulled the burned out \ntruck away from the barricade at about 5:30 p.m.  Larger numbers of protesters began to arrive after \nthat.  Lenoble’s pictures show the police shooting water at a peaceful crowd including a man holding \nup a ceremonial peace pipe, persons making peace signs with their fingers, and people who were \ntaking photographs or video.  When teargas was launched all the way to the south end of the bridge, \nit impeded protesters from leaving as south was the only way to go.  According to Lenoble, the police \ncontinued to shoot impact munitions into the crowd. \n  Lenoble said he never saw anyone threaten or attack the police, although he acknowledged \nthe protesters did not leave the bridge. See Docket No. 81-27.  Lenoble stated, “The police appeared \nto be completely safe, and separated from the water protectors by the concrete and razor wire \nbarricade, military style police vehicles, other police vehicles, and the one broken down truck that \nwas remaining.” See Docket No. 81-27, p. 13.  Lenoble’s photographs show that the law enforcement \nofficers were wearing helmets and visors and holding shields.  Lenoble described how the shooting \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 7 of 35\nand water spraying went on for hours as protesters remained on the bridge, signing and drumming, \nand medics and ambulances removed the wounded.  After Lenoble took a photograph of a law \nenforcement officer, he saw him walk over to another officer who was holding a rubber bullet gun \nand nod in his direction.  The law enforcement officer took direct aim at him, but he was able to avoid \ngetting hit. \n  Phillip Weeks was a “legal observer” in the vicinity of the Backwater Bridge for six hours on \nthe night of November 20, 2016. See Docket No. 81-27.  Weeks observed that law enforcement \nofficers were separated from the protesters by a burned vehicle and coils of concertina wire that \nblocked the law enforcement officers and the protesters from one another.  At the beginning of the \nevening, Weeks heard one announcement from law enforcement officers warning the protesters to \nmove south.  After that, canisters and munitions were fired.  Weeks noted, “Most of those gathered \nwere standing on the highway away from the razor wire and thus a significant distance from law \nenforcement who were all on the north side of the wire.  From what I could see they were only engaged \nin peaceful protest, song, or prayer.” See Docket No. 81-27, p. 2.  Weeks further noted: \n  At 6:36 pm, I recorded the sound of law enforcement using the water cannons to \nsoak the protesters.  The force of the water cannons was enough to knock some of \nthe protesters off their feet.  The water cannon they were using was on the top of a \nSWAT like vehicle where the LRAD equipment was located.  The top of the vehicle \nwas approximately 15-20 feet off the ground and the water cannon could reach \npeople on the road, arching water high in the air or by a direct line of fire.  Water \nprotectors were sprayed whether they were on the highway or off to the side of the \nhighway.  In addition to the water cannon, the tear gas, and the smoke canisters, \nthere was ammunition fired over the protesters that created large booms.  At this \ntime there were additional calls for medics for injured water protectors. \n \nSee Docket No. 81-23, p. 2.  Weeks states he did not hear another law enforcement announcement \nafter the warning he recorded at approximately 6:23 pm – before the arrival of many of the protesters.  \nWeeks noted: \nThe entire time that I was legal observing the use of the water cannons never \nappeared directed to put out the two controlled camp fires the protesters had made \nto keep warm, but rather, to assault water protectors. . . . I never observed any of \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 8 of 35\nthe protesters do anything that could reasonably be interpreted as aggressive toward \nlaw enforcement. The only things that I saw thrown from the side of the water \nprotecters to the side of the razor wire where law enforcement was located was an \noccasional plastic bottle of water, maybe 4 in total throughout the entire evening (7 \nhours). I also witnessed an individual protester try to throw a spent smoke canister \nfrom where it landed on the west side [] of Highway 1806 to the north side of the \nrazor wire where the police were located. All of the other protesters I observed \ngathered in protest to DAPL were only engaged in peaceful protest, song, or prayer. \nNone of the protesters I witnessed were engaged in attempts to cross the razor wire \nor carry out any type of assault against the law enforcement. I witnessed the \nmajority of protesters in prayer, standing quietly in opposition to the construction \nof the Dakota Access Pipeline, or chanting slogans.  \n \nSee Docket No. 81-23, pp. 3-4.  Weeks also noted, \n \nThe water cannons were used throughout the night, either taking direct aim at \nprotesters or arched high in the air. Thus many of the protesters who were far back \nfrom the “front line” were sprayed with water. At one point in the night, water \nprotectors held up a tarp for the sole purpose of keeping the prayer assembly from \nbeing doused by the water from the cannons as they sung their prayers. . . . The use \nof the water cannons, pepper spray, and munitions by law enforcement appeared \nlargely indiscriminate.  \n \nSee Docket No. 81-23, p. 4. \n \nCecilia Candia, an attorney, who also acted as a legal observer, observed the incident from \nwhat she thought was a safe distance, south of the bridge, but was still impacted by the teargas. See \nDocket No. 81-25.  Candia observed use of the water cannon and gas canisters by law enforcement \nofficers for over three hours.  Candia saw a gas canister launched next to the area where medics were \ntrying to treat the injured, several yards to the south of the bridge and nowhere near the barbed wire \nfencing to the north of the bridge.  Candia noted: \nSince there was only one way away from the area – South of the bridge and South \non the highway – there often was no safe way away from law enforcement.  Because \nofficers were throwing gas canisters far into the middle of the crowd on the bridge, \nand also to the South of the bridge, people, including myself, were locked in by the \ngas, and also blinded and gagging from the gas.  There was no safe way away and \nout.     \n \nSee Docket No. 81-25, p. 4.  Candia saw many protesters injured and never heard any dispersal \nannouncements from law enforcement officers. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 9 of 35\n  Gabriela Lopez, an attorney, also acted as a legal observer of the November 20, 2016, incident \non Backwater Bridge.  See Docket No. 81-28.  Lopez observed police indiscriminately shoot water \ncannons at peaceful protesters from behind the barricade.  Lopez saw what she believed to be flash \nbang grenades and tear gas canisters land as far as the south end of the bridge, close to where some \nmedics were helping people.  Lopez saw several gas canisters shot at vehicles, including a medic \nvehicle, that were approximately 40-60 feet south of the police barricade.  Lopez observed the police \nthrow at least four flash bang-like grenades at protesters peacefully assembling on the banks of the \nriver.  Lopez noted that clouds of tear gas made it difficult to see where to go, her own eyes watered, \nshe gagged, and due to her asthma, had difficulty breathing as a result of the tear gas.  Lopez observed \ninjured people, including a person who had to be carried by others and a man who suffered a seizure, \nas well as repeated calls for medical attention.  During the three to four hours she was on the scene, \nLopez said she never heard any warnings or dispersal orders from the police.  Lopez did not see any \nprotesters threaten the police, or use any weapons, with the exception of a few individuals who threw \nthe gas canisters that had been launched by the police, back towards the police. \n  Zachary Johnson, an emergency medical technician, heard that people were getting shot at the \nbridge and went to see if he could help injured individuals.  See Docket No. 81-2.  Johnson remained \nin the vicinity for about 7 – 9 hours.  Johnson saw law enforcement officers spraying the protesters \nwith a water cannon for at least eight hours, including people who were not near the barricade, and \nwere not doing anything threatening or aggressive.  It also appeared to Johnson that people with \ncameras were targeted with the water.  Johnson saw that some of the canisters fired by police were \nstarting grass fires, and he and other protesters tried to put them out by dousing them with water and \nstomping on the fires, despite the tear gas.  Johnson watched as law enforcement officers fired at \nprotesters who had their hands up while at close range; he saw an officer shoot a protester who had \njust shouted this was a peaceful action, and that man was carried away by medics.  Johnson saw law \nenforcement officers firing directly into crowds of people who were just standing together.  Johnson \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 10 of 35\nsaid he saw a protester get shot in the back who was carrying someone away.  Johnson saw a law \nenforcement officer spray mace directly in the face of a protester who was sitting on the ground \npraying, and saw the officer laugh as he walked away.  Johnson saw protesters throw two open water \nbottles.  Each time this happened, he observed other protesters yell at the individual who threw the \nwater bottle not to throw things or do anything violent because the protesters were engaged in \nprayerful action. \n  Johnson stated he was hit in the leg with a “grenade” fired by law enforcement officers and \nfell down when he was more than 50 feet from the barricade.  Johnson was bruised for weeks \nafterward.  Johnson noted he still struggles with the trauma of that night, which “felt like a one-sided \nwar zone.” See Docket No. 81-2, p. 5.   \n  Alberto Flores, a clinical social worker, went to the Oceti Sakowin camp to provide mental \nhealth support. See Docket No. 81-21.  On November 20, 2016, Flores observed what was occurring \nin the vicinity of the bridge for four to five hours.  Flores saw a small group of protesters close to the \npolice barricade, and a larger group further back, on the southern portion of the bridge and south of \nthe bridge itself.  Flores saw many protesters praying and drumming in a peaceful way while being \ndrenched in icy water by the police from a mounted water cannon.  Throughout the four to five hours \nFlores was present at the scene, he saw officers spray water as far as it could reach on all sides of the \nbridge, apparently trying to soak as many people as possible.  Flores never heard any police \nannouncements or orders from where he was standing.  With the exception of one person whom Flores \nsaw throw a small object from 50-100 yards from the barricade, he did not see protesters throwing \nthings at the police, or in any way threatening them.  Flores observed the police were well armed, \nthey were behind razor wire, concrete barricades, and a burnt out truck, and they had multiple military \nstyle vehicles. \n  Flores saw teargas canisters land on the south side of the bridge, even as far as the area where \nmedics were treating people, as well as in the middle of the crowd and in the grassy area on the banks \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 11 of 35\nof the bridge.  Flores observed some of the canisters started fires in the grass along the banks of the \nbridge which protesters were trying to put out.  Flores observed tear gas envelope the medical area \nand impair the medics’ ability to provide medical care to the affected protesters.  Flores witnessed at \nleast twenty to forty protesters being treated for shock, hypothermia, and tear gas, and at least three \npeople with large welts on their backs and faces who reported that their injuries were the result rubber \nbullets or similar projectiles.  Flores saw protesters start a small controlled fire and warm themselves \nthere, on the south side of the bridge about 100 to 150 yards from the police barricade, and another \nto the northeast of the bridge.  Flores said he never saw or heard of anyone attempting to throw logs \nor burning logs at police. \n  David Karayof was in the area of the bridge from 5 p.m. until 12:30 a.m. the next day. See \nDocket No. 81-18.  Karayof said he went to peacefully protest, he was not armed, and he did not see \nany other protester armed with any weapon.  At 6:15 p.m., Karayof saw a man whose hands were up \nstruck in the chest with a tear gas canister, causing him to fall backwards.  Karayof noted law \nenforcement officers shot additional tear gas canisters as he and others were bottlenecked on the \nbridge.  Later, Karayof noted law enforcement officers shot explosive devices and tear gas canisters \ntoward both corners of the northern barricade and as people ran, additional canisters were shot into \nthe crowd.  Karayof noted the tear gas caused his eyes and throat to burn, he had difficulty breathing, \nhe gasped for air, and vomited.  Karayof saw other protesters vomiting, screaming, and crying.  \nKarayof said he saw 20 protesters hit with rubber bullets.  Karayof observed protesters being directly \nsprayed with water while their eyes were closed and their hands were fixed in a praying position.  \nKarayof was doused with water as he carried blankets and ponchos to others. \n  Thomas Frazier, a former commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, reviewed the \nparties’ briefs and the affidavits submitted and opined,  \n  In my professional opinion the Defendants’ representation that what happened on \nNovember 20, 2016 near standing Rock was a riot is overstated and inaccurate.  It \nwas, by and large, a crowd control event.  By that I mean there were a handful of \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 12 of 35\nprotestors whose intentions were to challenge law enforcement activity and cross \npolice lines.  They threw objects and attempted to breach the concertina wire and \nmove the vehicle on the bridge.  The one person able to cross the concertina wire \nwas immediately arrested.  The bulk of the protestors were there to protect tribal \nlands and sacred religious sites.  Though present, these persons did not challenge \nlaw enforcement, were prayerful, and not assaultive in any way and there was, \ntherefore, no justification to use force on them.  Even assuming that there were \npersons on the front line who were throwing objects or otherwise posing a physical \nthreat to the police, the reach of law enforcement’s shoulder fired weapons and the \nwater cannon were from 25 to 100 yards, an expansive area which encompassed \nand  reached  protestors  who  had  no  intention  of  challenging  the  line  of  law \nenforcement.  The reach of these weapons ensured that individuals outside any zone \nor area that even could be considered to be directly confronting law enforcement \ncould be and was subject to serious bodily injury.  This is contrary to modern law \nenforcement standards for use of force.  \n \nSee Docket No. 81-1, p. 3.  Frazier went on to state, “If any protestor were able to breach the \nconcertina wire, there were adequate law enforcement officers on the skirmish line to effect an \nimmediate arrest.” See Docket No. 81-1, p. 4.  Frazier also noted, “Perhaps the true nature of the \nprotest is best demonstrated by the fact that, despite the Defendants’ claim that the protest was out of \ncontrol, only one arrest was made and there was only one minor injury to an officer.” See Docket No. \n81-1, p. 4.  \n  Frazier expressed the following concerns regarding the use of direct fired impact munitions, \nlaunched munitions, and water hoses on the crowd:   \n  Law enforcement’s unnecessary use of these weapons and the resulting serious \ninjuries from their use are important reasons which justify the Plaintiff’s request \nthat this Court prohibit the reckless use of [] these weapons.  If the victims of these \nweapons had violated the law, there were enough law enforcement officers present \nto arrest them.  Therefore, there exists no reasonable justification for their use. \n \nAdditionally, the use by law enforcement of shotgun fired bean bag rounds, as seen \nin video supplied to me by the plaintiffs, is excessive.  These are highly dangerous \nweapons which should never be used indiscriminately in a crowd, yet that is exactly \nwhat I saw based on the video evidence.  It is inappropriate and excessive force to \nshoot beanbag rounds, or to launch direct impact sponge rounds, into a crowd for \nthe purpose of crowd dispersal. Launched munitions, including explosive grenades, \ngas, and smoke canisters, with their high trajectory, as evidenced by the video, \nlanded far behind protestor lines, injuring persons on the periphery of the protest \nwho were clearly not advancing on the police. This too was an unnecessary use of \nforce, and was also likely responsible for many of the fires reported by law \nenforcement. Also, when an emergency call for assistance is broadcast, the level of \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 13 of 35\ntraining  of  responding  officers  is  unknown  and  thus  use  of  specialty  impact \nmunitions, explosive grenades and other weapons that require specialized training \nis contra-indicated. \n \n  I have never seen in any other American city or county, the use of water hoses or a \nwater cannon against a United States citizen for any reason although I have read \nabout this occurring in the early 1960s against civil rights marchers. The brute force \nof the impact of the water jet is a force option that would not be considered \nappropriate by most modern police chiefs or sheriffs, or tolerated by their citizenry. \nIn this case, the use of this device in sub-freezing temperatures, in my opinion, \nserves no reasonable purpose and can only be considered a retaliatory and punitive \naction. Not only can the water jet cause injury when applied at such short range, \nbut the water was also subsequently sprayed in a wide arc and far behind protestor \nlines, seemingly to get as many protestors wet as possible. The video evidence \nshows indiscriminate use of the water on peaceful protesters who were not being \naggressive towards the police. In the sub-freezing weather, its use was certain to \ncause hypothermia, which it did. It was reported that approximately two dozen \npeople were hospitalized for hypothermia on the night in question. This was an \nobvious and predictable outcome of the use of the water jet. Further, it was clearly \nintentional, and unnecessary on the part of the law enforcement decision makers.  \n \nSee Docket No. 81-1, pp. 4-5.  Frazier further noted: \n \n[A]lthough  I  would  never  condone  [the]  use  of  hoses  or  water  cannons  on \nprotesters, or [the] indiscriminate use of impact munitions on a crowd, if the \nintention was crowd dispersal, such use should have ceased as soon as it became \napparent that it was not having the desired effect.  Law enforcement should \ndistinguish between persons who attack the police or actively resist arrest, and \nprotesters who disobey dispersal orders as an act of symbolic civil disobedience.  \nThere is no legitimate reason to continue using force on demonstrators who are \nsimply nonviolently disobeying a dispersal order once it is clear that they are \ndetermined to hold their ground until arrested.  The only proper police response is \nto make arrests – not to deliberately inflict physical punishment. \n \nSee Docket No. 81-1, pp. 5-6. \n  A number of declarations submitted by the Plaintiffs in their reply brief note the protesters \nnever heard any announcements from law enforcement officials warning the protesters to move south, \none declarant only heard one announcement from law enforcement officials, and one declarant noted \nthat he heard one announcement to step back, but there was not enough time to do so before impact \nmunitions were utilized. See Docket Nos. 81-4, p. 1; 81-12, p. 2; 81-16, p. 1; 81-21, p. 2; 81-23, pp. \n1-3; 81-25, pp. 4-5.  Several declarants said they observed law enforcement officers employ force \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 14 of 35\nindiscriminately on the protesters, including individuals who were not threatening or attacking law \nenforcement officers. See Docket No. 81-2, p. 2; 81-5, p. 2; 81-18, p. 3; 81-21, pp. 1-2; 81-26, pp. 1-\n2; 81-27, pp. 9, 17-18; 81-28, p. 2.  The Plaintiffs also contend the Defendants’ use of excessive force \nhas continued.  In support of their assertion, the Plaintiffs submitted a declaration by Marcus Mitchell \nwhich states he was injured on January 19, 2017, when law enforcement officers again used impact \nmunitions to disperse a crowd of protesters from the Backwater Bridge. See Docket No. 81-10. \n  As noted by this Court in Dakota Access, LLC v. Archambault, et al., in September 2016, the \nmajority of the protesters are non-violent.  However, it is clear and undisputed there are a sizeable \nminority of protesters who can best be categorized as a group of unlawful and violent agitators who \nare masked up; terrorize law enforcement officers with taunting, threats, and acts of violence; and \nwhose primary purpose is to simply create chaos and mayhem.  To describe these agitators as \n“peaceful and prayerful” defies common sense. \nState and local public officials have taken action in attempts to get the mayhem under control. \nOn August 15, 2016, the Morton County Board of Commissioners declared a state of emergency due \nto the unlawful activity occurring at the DAPL project site which threatened the health, well-being \nand safety of law enforcement officers and the general public, and required additional manpower, \nresources and other expenditures to protect life and property. See Docket No. 61-4.  On August 19, \n2016, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple signed Executive Order 2016-04 authorizing the total \nutilization of the North Dakota State Emergency Operations Plan to respond to the situation. See \nDocket No. 58-2.  On September 8, 2016, Governor Dalrymple activated a military police unit to \nsupport law enforcement efforts with primary responsibilities to be with traffic control points and \nadministrative duties. See Docket No. 61-2, pp. 15-16.  The State of North Dakota made an \nEmergency Management Assistance Compact request to other states for law enforcement assistance \non October 7, 2016, due to the escalated protest activities by individuals protesting the pipeline \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 15 of 35\nconstruction. See Docket No. 61-2, p. 40.  By October 2016, law enforcement had made 269 arrests \nin relation to the DAPL protests. See Docket No. 61-2, p. 49.   \n \nIV.  THE DEFENDANTS’ VERSION OF EVENTS \nA.  OCTOBER 27, 2016 \nPrior to October 27, 2016, the protesters had re-established the camp (“North Camp”) on \nprivate property (Cannonball Ranch) located north of the Backwater Bridge, without permission to \ndo so, in the direct path of the pipeline project. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 2; 54, pp. 2-3. The camp was \nlocated east of Highway 1806 and extended eastward and south along Highway 1806 from a point \nwhere the Dakota Access pipeline had planned to cross beneath Highway 1806. See Docket Nos. 52, \np. 2; 54, pp. 2-3.  The North Camp included teepees, tents and other structures. See Docket Nos. 52, \np. 2; 53, p. 2; 54, p. 3; 55, p. 8.   \nIt was estimated several hundred protesters were occupying the North Camp and private \nproperty, with an additional 80 protesters with a dozen horses located at the County Road 134 site. \nSee Docket Nos. 52, p. 3; 53, p. 2; 54, p. 4.  Protesters had also established road blocks on County \nRoad 134 and on Highway 1806, including at the Backwater Bridge. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 2; 53, \npp. 1-2; 54, p. 4; 55, p. 3.  The undisputed evidence reveals protesters refused commands by law \nenforcement and government officials on October 26, 2016, to vacate the private property and remove \nprotester-built road blocks, despite repeated assurances by law enforcement officials to protesters \nthey were “free to go” and would not be arrested if they simply walked south to the Seven Council \nFires Camp, located south of the Backwater Bridge. See Docket No. 55, pp. 3-4.  \nOn October 27, 2016, law enforcement’s efforts to remove the blockades and protesters from \nprivate property located north of the Backwater Bridge was met with violence.  See Docket Nos. 52, \npp. 3-5; 53, p. 3-6; 54, pp. 4-6; 55, pp. 6-9.  Protesters threw rocks, logs, bottles, feces, and other \ndebris at officers and one woman pulled a weapon and fired three rounds near the police line. See \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 16 of 35\nDocket Nos. 52, p. 3; 53, pp. 4-5; 54, p. 4; 55, pp. 7-8; 61-5.  Some of the protesters wore ear plugs, \ngoggles or gas masks and wore bandanas over their face to conceal their identities. See Docket Nos. \n52, p. 4; 53, pp. 2-3; 54, p. 4; 55, p. 6.  Protesters burned heavy construction equipment used on the \nDAPL project, set fire to a vehicle on Highway 1806 near the North Camp, set fire on a bridge on \nCounty Road 134, tried to set a vehicle on fire under an electrical transmission tower located along \nHighway 1806, and set a vehicle and an electronic highway sign on fire near the north end of the \nBridge. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 4-5; 53, pp. 3, 5-6; 54, pp. 4-6; 55, p. 7-9.  As the police line \nproceeded south toward the Backwater Bridge, protesters threw Molotov cocktails (homemade \nexplosives) at law enforcement. See Docket Nos. 53, p. 6; 54, p. 6; 55, p. 9.  It is undisputed that \nprotesters secured themselves to buried anchors located in structures and to vehicles located on \nHighway 1806 with devices called sleeping dragons. See Docket Nos. 53, p. 4; 54, p. 5.  Another \nprotester attempted to secure himself with a sleeping dragon to the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected \n(“MRAP”)  vehicle  utilized  by  law  enforcement  officials  on  Highway  1806  in  an  attempt  to \nimmobilize it. See Docket No. 54, p. 5.  Protesters on horseback intentionally stampeded several \nhundred bison toward law enforcement officers and other protesters – twice, which were diverted by \nthe intervention of a nearby helicopter which moved the bison away from people. See Docket Nos. \n52, p. 4; 53, p. 5; 54, p. 5; 55, pp. 7-8.  Protesters also attempted to flank the police line. See Docket \nNos. 52, p. 4; 53, p. 5; 55, p. 7.  \nThe  record  reveals  protesters  repeatedly  resisted  law  enforcement’s  commands,  and  it \nfrequently took three or four law enforcement officers to restrain and cuff a single protester. See \nDocket Nos. 52, p. 4; 53, p. 4; 54, p. 5; 55, p. 7.  Law enforcement officers reported the observance \nof numerous weapons on the protesters during this incident, including a firearm, hunting knives, \nhatchets, large logs, large rocks, and other weapons. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 4; 53, p. 4-5; 54, pp. 4-\n5; 55, p. 4-9.  One or more protesters drove a vehicle beneath an electric powerline tower located a \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 17 of 35\nshort distance to the east of, and near the intersection of County Road 134 and Highway 1806, placed \na rag in its gas tank, and tried to set it on fire. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 5; 53, p. 6.  \nAfter  law  enforcement  officials  moved  protesters  south  of  the  Backwater  Bridge,  law \nenforcement placed and disabled two large military surplus dump trucks across the north side of the \nBackwater Bridge as a barricade. See Docket Nos. 53, p. 6; 54, p. 6; 55, pp. 8-9.  Within roughly 10-\n15 minutes of these vehicles being placed on the bridge, protesters set both vehicles on fire. See \nDocket Nos. 52, p. 5; 53, p. 6; 54, p. 6; 55, pp. 8-9.  Protesters also set a third vehicle and a North \nDakota Department of Transportation (“DOT”) electronic sign on fire near the north end of the bridge. \nSee Docket Nos. 52, p. 5; 53, p. 6; 54, p. 6.  It is undisputed that protesters gathered on the bridge and \nrefused commands to leave. See Docket No. 54, p. 6.  \nThe Backwater Bridge was deemed unsafe and closed to all access on October 28, 2016, by \nthe DOT due to a large fire the protesters had started on the bridge on October 27, 2016, including \nthe burning of a vehicle on the bridge (in addition to the two burned out dump trucks), and under the \nauthority granted pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 24-03-05 and the Governor’s Executive Order 2016-04, \nsigned on August 19, 2016. See Docket Nos. 58, pp. 2-3; 58-1; 58-2; 59; 59-2; 59-3. \nDuring the October 27, 2016, violent incident, it is undisputed protesters also assaulted a \nDAPL construction worker north and east of the bridge, by forcing the worker’s vehicle off the road \nand chasing him while bearing weapons, firing a flare gun at him, and then burning the worker’s \nvehicle , all of which was captured on video. See Docket No. 61-6.  The worker was ultimately \nextricated by Bureau of Indian Affairs officers near the bridge where he had been surrounded by \nprotesters along the shoreline. See Docket Nos. 61-3, p. 11 and 61-6. \nThe record reveals law enforcement officers arrested 141 protesters on October 27, 2016—a \nmajority for conspiracy to endanger by fire, explosion, engaging in a riot and maintaining a public \nnuisance.  See Docket No. 54, p. 6.  As of October 28, 2016, law enforcement had made 411 arrests \nin relation to the DAPL protest.  As of 12:00 a.m. Friday morning (October 28, 2016), law \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 18 of 35\nenforcement were holding a line north of the bridge to prevent protesters from moving north—the \nsame location law enforcement would hold the line again during the subsequent November 20, 2016, \nriot. See Docket No. 54, p. 6.  The protesters’ stated objective is to stop completion of the pipeline \nproject across the Missouri River by any means possible.  Photographs of the riot and damage caused \nby protesters is available on the Morton County website. See Docket Nos. 61-2, pp. 69-81; 61-3, pp. \n1-8.   \nPursuant to correspondence from the Corps to the Morton County Sheriff’s Department on \nNovember 1, 2016, the Corps formally requested the assistance of law enforcement in removing \nprotesters from the Corps-managed lands located north and east of the Backwater Bridge. See Docket \nNos. 61-3, p. 12 and 61-7.  The Corps advised that isolated groups had been observed on October 31, \n2016, using small boats to travel form the Seven Council Fires Camp, up the North Branch of the \nCatapeta Creek, to land and encamp upon Corps-managed federal lands located north of the bridge.  \nThe Corps advised it had not provided any permits or permission for anyone to access that area, and \nadvised the area had not been opened for use by the public for recreational or camping purposes.  It \nis undisputed the Corps considered such individuals to be trespassers. \nLaw enforcement officers investigated the Corps’ report and discovered the protesters were \nrebuilding a man-made, wooden bridge across the Cantapeta Creek east of the Backwater Bridge near \nthe confluence of the Cannonball River. See Docket No. 52, pp. 5-6.  The wooden bridge violated \nnumerous federal and state law and provided protesters access to the Corps-managed land on the north \nshort, and direct access to the nearby Dakota Access pipeline project site located immediately to the \nnorth.  Protesters attempted to cross the creek at this location (Turtle Island to Turtle Hill) via man-\nmade structures, boats, kayaks, canoes, swimming and wading, despite repeated warnings by law \nenforcement not to do so. See Docket No. 52, pp. 5-6.  Protesters at this location threw rocks, bricks, \na paddle, and other objects at law enforcement officers located on the north shoreline and in boats \nutilized to dismantle the illegal structures. See Docket No. 52, pp. 6-7. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 19 of 35\nAs stated by Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney: \nIn my 27 years in law enforcement, I have never seen such an absolute disregard \nfor the law, or other people’s rights because of someone else’s ideology. The idea \nthat because you have a strong opinion about something means you can threaten, \nharass and intimidate other American citizens is just plain wrong. I took an oath to \nprotect the first amendment, but I also took an oath to protect citizens from this \ncontinual harassment and intimidation. \n \nSee Docket No. 61-3, p. 13. \n  Between October 27, 2016, and the November 20, 2016, riot, protesters also engaged in \nunlawful activities at other locations throughout Morton County and Burleigh County, including:  \ncreating illegal roadblocks on Highway 6 south of St. Anthony; creating illegal roadblocks on County \nRoad 135 and County Road 81; trespassing on private property; slashing tires on six law enforcement \nvehicles; damaging construction equipment used on the DAPL project; blocking a BNSF railway by \nattempting to set a disabled vehicle, placed across the tracks, on fire west of Mandan; resisting arrest; \nand otherwise ignoring lawful commands from law enforcement. See Docket No. 61-3, pp. 13-22.\n     \nB. NOVEMBER 20, 2016 \n  Prior to the November 20, 2016, riot, protesters had been making incursions onto private land \n(including the Cannonball Ranch across from which the pipeline project passes) and Corps-managed \nproperty located north of the bridge, for over three months.  On November 20, 2016, both of the \npreviously burned Morton County trucks were located next to, and south, of the jersey barriers and \nconcertina wire barricades on the north side of the Backwater Bridge which blocked Highway 1806.  \nSee Docket No. 54, p. 7-8.  Both trucks were chained with large log chains to the concrete jersey \nbarriers, and formed a part of law enforcements’ barricade.  There were two rows of jersey barriers \nrunning east-west across Highway 1806, with each row positioned approximately 12 to 15 feet apart.  \nBetween the rows of jersey barriers were three rows of concertina wire, with one row lying atop two \nground level rows.  The Backwater Bridge was closed by the DOT following the fire on October 27, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 20 of 35\n2016.  The bridge was marked by two large signs stating “No Trespassing,” and Highway 1806 was \nshutdown at this location. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 11; 54, p. 8.  The Corps had requested that law \nenforcement prevent protesters from trespassing on Corps-managed land located north of the Seven \nCouncil Fires Camp. See Docket No. 61-7, p. 1.   \n  The November 20, 2016, incident started in the afternoon when, against the repeated warnings \nand commands of law enforcement officers located on the north side of the barricade, protesters used \na large bolt cutter and a semi-truck to cut the chain securing the burned out dump truck located in the \nwest lane, and drug it away from the law enforcements’ barricade. See Docket No. 54, pp. 7-9.  The \nprotesters then returned to remove the remaining burned out dump truck which was secured to, and a \npart of, the law enforcements’ barricade.  The affidavits submitted by the Defendants reveal the \nnumber of protesters on the Backwater Bridge swelled at this point to several hundred. See Docket \nNo. 54, p. 9.  The Defendants contend the protesters appeared to be prepared for an assault on the \nroughly 20 law enforcement officers manning the barricade. \n  The protesters organized themselves into two principal bodies – a forward staged siege group \nwearing rain coats, goggles, and bandanas over their faces, and bearing assorted shields made of \nplywood, plastic, and corrugated tin/steel, along with tarps, and a larger group which remained further \nback south on the Backwater Bridge. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 10-11, 15-16; 53, p. 6-10; 54, pp. 9, 11, \n15.  The forward group utilized their shields and tarps to form a mobile barricade to shield themselves \nand other protesters from law enforcements’ view and from any force which may be applied by law \nenforcement. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 15; 53, p. 10; 54, pp. 11-12.  The protesters moved this mobile \nbarricade up against the barricade to shield other protesters who were attempting to cut the chains on \nthe  remaining  burned  out  dump  truck,  and  protesters  cutting  the  concertina  wire  in  the  law \nenforcement’s barricade. See Docket Nos. 52, pp.  10-11, 15-16; 53, p. 7-9; 54, p. 11-12, 14-17.  Law \nenforcement officers gave repeated warnings over a Long Range Acoustic Device (“LRAD”) that \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 21 of 35\nprotesters were trespassing and that protesters should disengage and return to the south side of the \nbridge. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 13-15; 53, pp. 7, 10; 54, pp. 8-10, 15-17.   \n  It is undisputed that protesters were yelling profanities and throwing and slinging large rocks, \nlug nuts, construction nuts, padlocks, frozen water bottles, and other objects at law enforcement \nofficers. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 11-12, 14-16;53, pp. 7, 11; 54, pp. 9-10, 12-13, 17; 61-3, pp. 46-55 \n(photographs of weapons recovered following the riot).  The record reveals law enforcement officers \nfeared for their physical safety due to the imminent threats of serious bodily injury or death they were \nencountering.  See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 11-12; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 11, 13-14, 16-17.  \n  Law enforcement officers then deployed hand-tossed CS gas canisters to drive protesters \naway from the barricade, but due to the wind blowing to the northwest, the gas crossed over the police \nline, and its use was discontinued. See Docket Nos. 53, p. 9; 54, p. 11.  Protesters also threw the CS \ngas canisters back at law enforcement. See Docket Nos. 53, p. 9; 54, p. 12.  Officers attempted to stop \nthe forward siege group and protesters from throwing objects through the use of OC spray and direct \nimpact sponge and bean bag rounds, again to a limited effect due to the protesters’ mobile barricade \nand law enforcements’ barricade. See Docket Nos. 52, p. 14; 53, pp. 8-10, 12; 54, pp. 9-11, 13-14.  \nPolice shields were requested for the first time during the ongoing DAPL protests due to the constant \nbarrage of objects being thrown at law enforcement. See Docket No. 54, p. 11.  Not all officers had \nhelmets as the quarter master had run out. See Docket No. 54, p. 12.  A second “Code Red” was \nissued requesting all available law enforcement officers to respond within a 100-mile radius. \nSee Docket No. 54, p. 12.   \n  The record reveals protesters crossed the bridge and took up positions along the east and west \nflanks of the police line, starting several large bonfires along the east flank and along the north shore \nof the Cantapeta Creek. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 53, pp. 6-7; 54, pp. 12-13.  One of the bonfires \nwas built within approximately 30 feet of law enforcements’ barricade and protectors in that vicinity \nbegan throwing burning logs at the police line. See Docket No. 54, p. 13.  A brush truck from the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 22 of 35\nMandan Rural Fire Department was requested to address the fires. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 13-14; \n54, p. 14-16; 56, pp. 1-2. \n  As law enforcement reinforcements started to arrive, and when there were approximately 70 \nofficers on the scene to deal with approximately 800 – 1,000 protesters on or north of the Backwater \nBridge, the officers formed a shield line along the barricade. See Docket No. 54, p. 12.  The protesters \nthrew shields across the concertina wire, and one protester climbed over law enforcements’ barricade. \nSee Docket Nos. 53, p. 10; 54, p. 15.  This individual was the only person arrested during the riot—\nlaw enforcement was fully occupied in holding the line. See Docket No. 54, p. 15.  \n  While the siege group was working on cutting the concertina wire and the chains securing the \ntruck to the barricade, and while other protesters continued to throw objects at law enforcement \nofficers, a group of approximately 150 protesters gathered in the west ditch north of the bridge and \nproceeded west and north in an attempt to flank the police line. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 53, \npp. 11-12; 54, p. 12.  A small group of roughly 20 officers proceeded west to intercept this group.  \nSee Docket Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 54, p. 12.     \n  During this time period, law enforcement officers on the scene were also being marked by \nlasers and spotlights by individuals on high ground. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 53, p. 11; 54, p. \n12.  The record reveals there was concern about being targeted by snipers, consistent with previously \nknown social media threat and intelligence regarding weapons in the possession of protesters. See \nDocket Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 53, p. 11; 54, p. 12.  Law enforcement officers were also concerned about \nbeing overrun by the aggressive and violent protesters, and the possible consequences of that \neventuality.  See Docket Nos. 52, p. 12; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 13-14; 56, pp. 3-4; 57, pp. 4-5.  In addition \nto being concerned about the obvious risks to the physical safety of law enforcement officers on the \nscene is overrun, there was genuine concern about the potential need to resort to deadly force for the \nprotection of law enforcement and emergency responders on site, and concern about the potential loss \nof law enforcement vehicles (including armored vehicles) and the weapons and munitions which may \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 23 of 35\nlater be used by the protesters against law enforcement and others. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 12, 14-\n16; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 13-14.  At that time, a “Signal-100” was issued, requesting the assistance of \nall available law enforcement, state-wide. See Docket No. 54, p. 14.  The record reveals a number \nof photographs of the riot.  See Docket No. 61-3, pp. 38-40.   \n  With fire apparatus on the scene, and the methods being utilized by law enforcement proving \nineffective against the protesters, permission was requested, and received from command, to utilize \nwater to extinguish fires and hold the police line. See Docket Nos. 52, pp. 13-15; 53, pp. 8-9; 54, p. \n14.  Following repeated warning by law enforcement, both in relation to the ongoing trespass and \ncommands to proceed south of the bridge, and in relation to the intended application of water, water \nwas ultimately deployed against protesters utilizing the mobile barricade and attempting to dismantle \nand penetrate the law enforcement barricade, and those throwing objects at law enforcement officers.  \nSee Docket Nos. 54, pp. 14-15; 56, pp. 2-3; 57, pp. 2-5.  The Defendants contend no “water cannon” \nwas involved. See Docket Nos. 54, p. 15; 56, p. 3; 57, p. 4.  The Defendants also assert the application \nof water was crucial to law enforcements’ ability to prevent the penetration of law enforcements’ \nbarricade and prevent serious bodily injury or death to law enforcement and emergency responders \non the scene as a result of the immediate threats presented by the protesters. See Docket No. 54, p. \n16.   \n  On November 25, 2016, the Corps notified the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe they were closing \nthe Corps-managed land located north of the Cannonball River, an area encompassing the Seven \nCouncil Fires Camp, to all public access and use, effective December 5, 2016. See Docket No. 61-\n11.  The Corps advised anyone found on the property after December 5th would be considered \ntrespassing and subject to prosecution.  The Corps said the decision was necessary to protect the \ngeneral public from the dangerous confrontations between protesters and law enforcement officials \nwhich have occurred in the area, and to reduce the risk of harm to people in the encampments due to \nthe harsh North Dakota winter conditions. See Docket No. 61-11.  The Corps also established a free \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 24 of 35\nspeech zone located south of the Cannonball River for use by the protesters—an area more accessible \nto emergency services. \n  On November 28, 2016, and pursuant to Executive Order 2016-08, Governor Jack Dalrymple \nordered the immediate mandatory evacuation of all persons occupying areas managed by the Corps \nlocated in Morton County due to severe winter conditions, and ordered no person shall return to the \nevacuation area. See Docket No. 61-8.  The evacuation area encompasses the Seven Council Fires \nCamp located immediately south of the bridge.  Despite the Governor’s order, protesters remained in \nthe evacuation area. \n  On December 4, 2016, in an attempt to de-escalate the situation, law enforcement moved its \npresence further north, away from the Backwater Bridge and out of visual site from the bridge. See \nDocket No. 61-3, p. 64.  This decision was based upon the following conditions: \n1)  The protesters would agree to stay in the identified protest area which is the \nmain camp and south of the Backwater Bridge, and not on the bridge. \n2)  The protesters would agree to stay off the bridge unless a prearranged meeting \nwith Morton County is approved. \n3)  The protesters do not, at any time, attempt to remove any barriers or wires from \nthe bridge.  It is not their property and it remains there for safety reasons. \n4)  The protesters do not, at any time, move north of the bridge by walking, riding \nor flying a drone.  This includes trying to flank Law Enforcement on any side. \nSee Docket No. 61-3, p. 64.  The protesters were advised that “[a]dhering to these requests will show \ngood  faith  by  the  protest  groups,  and  will  reinforce  their  message  of  peaceful  and  prayerful \ngatherings.  Violation of these requests will show that protesters have chosen to be aggressors by \nviolating the law, and it will result in their arrest.” See Docket No. 61-3, p. 64.    \nOn  January  24,  2017,  United  States  President  Donald  Trump  signed  a  presidential \nmemorandum regarding the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline: \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 25 of 35\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY \nSUBJECT: Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline \nSection 1. Policy. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) under development by \nDakota  Access,  LLC,  represents  a  substantial,  multi-billion-dollar  private \ninvestment in our Nation's energy infrastructure. This approximately 1,100-mile \npipeline is designed to carry approximately 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil \nfrom the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to oil \nmarkets in the United States. At this time, the DAPL is more than 90 percent \ncomplete across its entire route. Only a limited portion remains to be constructed. \nI  believe  that  construction  and  operation  of  lawfully  permitted  pipeline \ninfrastructure serve the national interest. \nAccordingly, pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution \nand the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows: \nSec. 2. Directives. (a) Pipeline Approval Review. The Secretary of the Army shall \ninstruct the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers (USACE), including the Commanding General and Chief of \nEngineers, to take all actions necessary and appropriate to: \n(i) review and approve in an expedited manner, to the extent permitted by law and \nas warranted, and with such conditions as are necessary or appropriate, requests for \napprovals to construct and operate the DAPL, including easements or rights-of-way \nto cross Federal areas under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, 30 \nU.S.C. 185; permits or approvals under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 \nU.S.C. 1344; permits or approvals under section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, \n33 U.S.C. 408; and such other Federal approvals as may be necessary; \n(ii) consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, whether to rescind or \nmodify the memorandum by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works \ndated December 4, 2016 (Proposed Dakota Access Pipeline Crossing at Lake Oahe, \nNorth  Dakota),  and  whether  to  withdraw  the  Notice  of  Intent  to  Prepare  an \nEnvironmental  Impact  Statement  in  Connection  with  Dakota  Access,  LLC's \nRequest for an Easement to Cross Lake Oahe, North Dakota, dated January 18, \n2017, and published at 82 Fed. Reg. 5543; \n(iii) consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, prior reviews and \ndeterminations, including the Environmental Assessment issued in July of 2016 for \nthe DAPL, as satisfying all applicable requirements of the National Environmental \nPolicy Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and any other provision of law that \nrequires executive agency consultation or review (including the consultation or \nreview required under section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 \nU.S.C. 1536(a)); \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 26 of 35\n(iv) review and grant, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, requests for \nwaivers of notice periods arising from or related to USACE real estate policies and \nregulations; and \n(v) issue, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, any approved easements \nor rights-of-way immediately after notice is provided to the Congress pursuant to \nsection 28(w) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, 30 U.S.C. 185(w). \n(b) Publication. The Secretary of the Army shall promptly provide a copy of this \nmemorandum to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and the Governors of \neach State located along the Dakota Access Pipeline route. The Secretary of the \nArmy is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal \nRegister. \n(c) Private Property. Nothing in this memorandum alters any Federal, State, or local \nprocess or condition in effect on the date of this memorandum that is necessary to \nsecure access from an owner of private property to construct the pipeline and \nfacilities described herein. Land or an interest in land for the pipeline and facilities \ndescribed herein may only be acquired consistently with the Constitution and \napplicable State laws. \nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to \nimpair or otherwise affect: \n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head \nthereof; or \n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating \nto budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. \n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and \nsubject to the availability of appropriations. \n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, \nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the \nUnited States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or \nagents, or any other person. \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-\nconstruction-dakota-access-pipeline. \n   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 27 of 35\nV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nThe Plaintiffs seek to obtain a preliminary injunction pursuant to Rule 65(b) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 65(b) directs the court to look to the specific facts shown by an \naffidavit to determine whether immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the \napplicant.  It is well-established in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that the court is required to \nconsider the factors set forth in Dataphase Systems, Inc., v. C L Systems, Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th \nCir. 1981), in determining whether a preliminary injunction should be granted.  The Dataphase factors \ninclude “(1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of balance between this harm \nand the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties; (3) the probability the movant \nwill succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest.”  Id.   \nIt is well-established that the movant has the burden of establishing the necessity of a \npreliminary injunction. Baker Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Chaske, 28 F.3d 1466, 1472 (8th Cir. 1994).  “No \nsingle factor in itself is dispositive; in each case all of the factors must be considered to determine \nwhether on balance they weigh towards granting the injunction.” Id. at 1472. \n \nA.  PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS \n \n  When evaluating a movant’s likelihood of success on the merits, the court should “flexibly \nweigh the case’s particular circumstances to determine ‘whether the balance of equities so favors the \nmovant that justice requires the court to intervene to preserve the status quo until the merits are \ndetermined.’”  Calvin Klein Cosmetics Corp. v. Lenox Labs., Inc., 815 F.2d 500, 503 (8th Cir. 1987).  \nAt this stage, the Court need not decide whether the party seeking the preliminary injunction will \nultimately prevail.  PCTV Gold, Inc. v. SpeedNet, LLC, 508 F.3d 1137, 1143 (8th Cir. 2007).  \nAlthough a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction cannot be issued if the movant has \nno chance on the merits, “the Eighth Circuit has rejected a requirement as to a ‘party seeking \npreliminary relief prove a greater than fifty per cent likelihood that he will prevail on the merits.’”  \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 28 of 35\nId.  The Eighth Circuit has also held that of the four factors to be considered by the district court in \nconsidering preliminary injunctive relief, the likelihood of success on the merits is “most significant.”  \nS & M Constructors, Inc. v. Foley Co., 959 F.2d 97, 98 (8th Cir. 1992). \n  The Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges six separate causes of action, denoted as claims one through \nsix,  claims  three  through  six  (“Policies,  Customs,  or  Practices,”  “Training,  Supervision,  or \nDiscipline,” “Unequal Protection of Law,” and “Declaratory Relief”) are merely derivative of, and \ndependent  upon  the  Plaintiffs’  prevailing  upon  their  claims  of  (“Retaliation”)  and/or  two \n(“Unreasonable Use of Force”).  Claim One, alleging Retaliation, contends the Defendants, by \ncausing the Plaintiffs to suffer injuries, have chilled the exercise of their free speech rights in violation \nof  the  First,  Fourth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments.    Claim  Two  alleges  the  Defendants  used \nunreasonable force in dispersing the Plaintiffs on the Backwater Bridge on November 20, 2016, in \nviolation of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n  The United States Supreme Court has said the First Amendment cannot be utilized as a \njustification for trespass, and the government has the right to enforce trespass laws as to both private \nand public property.  See Adderley v. State of Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 47-48 (1966) (rejecting protesters’ \nargument they had a constitutional First Amendment right to remain in the curtilage of a jailhouse \nover the objection of the sheriff, concluding “[t]he United States Constitution does not forbid a State \nto control the use of its own property for its own lawful nondiscriminatory purpose.”).  As explained \nby the United States Supreme Court in Cox v. State of Louisiana: \nThe rights of free speech and assembly, while fundamental in our democratic \nsociety, still do not mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may \naddress a group at any public place and at any time. The constitutional guarantee \nof liberty implies the existence of an organized society maintaining public order, \nwithout which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of anarchy. The control \nof travel on the streets is a clear example of governmental responsibility to insure \nthis necessary order. A restriction in that relation, designed to promote the public \nconvenience in the interest of all, and not susceptible to abuses of discriminatory \napplication, cannot be disregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right \nwhich, in other circumstances, would be entitled to protection. One would not be \njustified in ignoring the familiar red light because this was thought to be a means \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 29 of 35\nof social protest. Nor could one, contrary to traffic regulations, insist upon a street \nmeeting in the middle of Times Square at the rush hour as a form of freedom of \nspeech or assembly. Governmental authorities have the duty and responsibility to \nkeep their streets open and available for movement. A group of demonstrators could \nnot insist upon the right to cordon off a street, or entrance to a public or private \nbuilding, and allow no one to pass who did not agree to listen to their exhortations.  \n \nWe emphatically reject the notion urged by appellant that the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments afford the same kind of freedom to those who would communicate \nideas  by  conduct  such  as  patrolling,  marching,  and  picketing  on  streets  and \nhighways, as these amendments afford to those who communicate ideas by pure \nspeech. See the discussion and cases cited in No. 49, post, at p. 480. We reaffirm \nthe statement of the Court in Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., supra, 336 U.S., \nat 502, 69 S.Ct., at 691, that “it has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom \nof speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct \nwas in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, \nwritten, or printed.” \n \n379 U.S. 536, 554-55 (1965) (citations omitted). \n \n  It is clear and undisputed that on November 20, 2016, the Backwater Bridge and Highway \n1806 near Cannonball, North Dakota, were closed to the general public and to all of the pipeline \nprotesters.  The Backwater Bridge is comprised of two driving lanes with no sidewalks in a 65 mile-\nper-hour zone.  The DOT closed the Backwater Bridge immediately following the October 27, 2016, \nriot and prior to November 20, 2016, for safety reasons due to damage to the bridge caused by fires \nstarted by protesters.  See N.D.C.C. § 24-03-05 (authorizing DOT to close any portion of a highway \nby posting same with suitable signs and placement of barricades, and making it unlawful to remove, \npass through, over, or around any such barricade).  It is undisputed the Backwater Bridge remained \nclosed on November 20, 2016.  No public access on the bridge was allowed on November 20, 2016, \nfor any purpose.  The Backwater Bridge was heavily barricaded, manned by law enforcement officers, \nand the bridge and surrounding areas were secured areas.  All persons, other than authorized law \nenforcement or government officials who entered upon the Backwater Bridge, or any location north \nof the bridge within the vicinity of the events on November 20, 2016, were trespassing and in violation \nof the law. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 30 of 35\n  The United States Supreme Court has said the control of traffic on public bridges, highways, \nand streets is a clear example of governmental responsibility to ensure peace, order, and the rule of \nlaw.  Even “peaceful and prayerful” protesters cannot insist upon marching, picketing, or protesting \non public bridges, streets, and highways as a form of freedom of speech or assembly, or a means of \nsocial protest, at any time or place they choose without restrictions.  Even the demonstrations by \nDAPL protesters on the streets of downtown Bismarck were unlawful without the proper permits and \npermission of city officials.  No one has the constitutional right to insist upon protesting on public \nbridges or highways whenever they unilaterally decide to do so, and without any permission to do so. \n  The Court finds that law enforcement officials had the clear authority to direct the Plaintiffs \nand other protesters to disperse and remove themselves from the Backwater Bridge and land located \nalong the north bank of the North Branch of the Cantapeta Creek on November 20, 2016.  The named \nPlaintiffs and pipeline protesters did not have an unfettered constitutional right to exercise their First \nAmendment rights on the Backwater Bridge on November 20-21, 2016.  Based on a careful review \nof the record before the Court, the Plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on their claim of retaliation.  The \nPlaintiffs have not sustained their burden of proof, and the burden of establishing the necessity of a \npreliminary injunction, based on the record before the Court.  The Court also finds that based on the \ncurrent record, the Plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on their claims of excessive force under the Fourth \nor Fourteenth Amendments.  \n  It is well-established in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that to determine “whether a \nparticular use of force was excessive, [the court] consider[s] whether it was objectively reasonable \nunder the circumstances[,] . . .rely[ing] on the perspective of a reasonable officer present at the scene \nrather than the ‘20/20 vision of hindsight.’”  Carpenter v. Gage, 686 F.3d 644, 649 (8th Cir. 2012) \n(quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1986)); Kukla v. Hulm, 310 F.3d 1046, 1050 (8th \nCir. 2002) (“Force is excessive when an officer’s actions are not objectively reasonable in light of the \nfacts and circumstances confronting him.”). \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 31 of 35\nThe first step in analyzing an excessive force claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is to identify the \nspecific constitutional right allegedly infringed upon.  The Plaintiffs allege an excessive force claim \nunder the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment protects individuals against “unreasonable \nsearches  and  seizures.”  U.S.  Const.  Amend.  IV.    An  excessive  force  claim  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment requires an allegation of the use of excessive force by the government in connection with \na seizure of the plaintiff.  “[A] person has been ‘seized’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment \nonly if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have \nbelieved that he was not free to leave.”  United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980).   \n  The Plaintiffs have neither alleged they were arrested or detained by law enforcement officials \non November 20, 2016, nor alleged they were informed by law enforcement officers they were not \nfree to leave and walk away.  The Plaintiffs and other pipeline protesters could have easily removed \nthemselves from the Backwater Bridge and the presence of law enforcement by simply complying \nwith  lawful  commands,  voluntarily  disengaging  from  law  enforcement,  and  dispersing  and \nproceeding south and away from the barricade on the Backwater Bridge and the secured areas manned \nby law enforcement officers.   \n  Assuming for the sake of argument the Plaintiffs have alleged viable excessive force claims \nunder the Fourth Amendment, the relevant inquiry is whether the level of force applied was \n“objectively reasonable” based on a totality of the circumstances analysis.  See Graham v. Connor, \n490 U.S. 386, 396-97 (1989). \nDetermining whether the force used to effect a particular seizure is “reasonable” \nunder the Fourth Amendment requires a careful balancing of the nature and quality \nof  the  intrusion  on  the  individual's  Fourth  Amendment  interests  against  the \ncountervailing  governmental  interests  at  stake.    Our  Fourth  Amendment \njurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory \nstop necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or \nthreat thereof to effect it.  Because the test of reasonableness under the Fourth \nAmendment  is  not  capable  of  precise  definition  or  mechanical  application, \nhowever,  its  proper  application  requires  careful  attention  to  the  facts  and \ncircumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 32 of 35\nwhether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, \nand whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight. \n \nThe  “reasonableness”  of  a  particular  use  of  force  must  be  judged  from  the \nperspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision \nof hindsight.  The Fourth Amendment is not violated by an arrest based on probable \ncause, even though the wrong person is arrested, nor by the mistaken execution of \na valid search warrant on the wrong premises.  With respect to a claim of excessive \nforce, the same standard of reasonableness at the moment applies: Not every push \nor shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers, \nviolates the Fourth Amendment. The calculus of reasonableness must embody \nallowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second \njudgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—\nabout the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation. \nAs in other Fourth Amendment contexts, however, the “reasonableness” inquiry in \nan excessive force case is an objective one: the question is whether the officers' \nactions  are  “objectively  reasonable”  in  light  of  the  facts  and  circumstances \nconfronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation. An \nofficer's evil intentions will not make a Fourth Amendment violation out of an \nobjectively reasonable use of force; nor will an officer's good intentions make an \nobjectively unreasonable use of force constitutional. \nGraham, 490 U.S. at 396-97.   \n  At this early stage of the litigation, and after a careful review of the record, the Court finds no \nreasonable juror could conclude the level of non-lethal force used by law enforcement officers during \nthe chaos on November 20, 2016, at the Backwater Bridge was objectively unreasonable, based on \nthe totality of the facts and circumstances that confronted law enforcement officers on the bridge.  \nThe record reveals two “Code Reds” and a “Signal 100” requesting the aid of every available \nlaw enforcement officer statewide were utilized – which are emergency measures not taken \nlightly.  Intermediate and less-lethal force was utilized by law enforcement personnel after commands \nfor protesters to disperse.   \nThe videos reviewed by the Court reveal a very chaotic scenario with law enforcement officers \noutmanned and flanked by protesters on and around the bridge area.  The Court is fully aware of the \nindiscriminate use of water and other forms of non-lethal force that were used that evening in the \nmidst of the darkened chaos.  The Court is also cognizant that is it sometimes difficult for a law \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 33 of 35\nenforcement officer to determine how the doctrine of excessive force will apply to the particular \nfactual situation the officer is confronted with. See Ashcroft v. Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 742 (2011).   \nThe Court further finds that based on the record reviewed at this stage, the Plaintiffs are \nunlikely to prevail on their claim of excessive force under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The \nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause protects citizens from governmental deprivation of life, \nliberty, and property without due process of law.  U.S. Const. Amend. XIV.  The Eighth Circuit Court \nof Appeals has noted the standard which must be met to establish excessive force in violation of the \nFourteenth  Amendment  is  a  more  burdensome  standard  than  is  applied  under  the  “objective \nreasonableness” standard utilized under the Fourth Amendment.  The claimant must establish, among \nother things, the specific application of force which “shocks the conscience.”  Wilson v. Spain, 209 \nF.3d 713, 716 (8th Cir. 2000). \n  Based upon the record presented to the Court, the Court finds the Plaintiffs are unlikely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claims, and they have not sustained their burden of proof.  Thus, this \nDataphase factor weighs against the requested injunctive relief. \n \nB.  IRREPARABLE HARM \nIn  their  request  for  injunctive  relief,  the  Plaintiffs  are  asserting  a  possibility  that  law \nenforcement officers may use excessive force at some undetermined time and place, and in relation \nto unknown factual circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted at this time.  This Court has \nheld that the ‘mere possibility’ harm may occur before a trial on the merits is not enough” to establish \nirreparable harm if injunctive relief is not granted.  MKB Management Corp. v. Burdick, 954 \nF.Supp.2d 900, 912 (D.N.D. 2013).  The party seeking injunctive relief has the burden to show that \na significant risk of harm exists, and the absence of such a showing is sufficient grounds to deny a \nrequest for injunctive relief.  This Dataphase factor weighs against the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 34 of 35\nC.  THE BALANCE OF HARM \nThe balance of harm Dataphase factor examines the harm to all parties to the dispute and \nother interested parties, including the general public.  See Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 114; Glenwood \nBridge, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 940 F.2d 367, 372 (8th Cir. 1991).  The Court finds that the harm \nto the public interest in maintaining law and order, preserving the peace, protecting the lives and \nsafety of law enforcement officers when upholding the rule of law, and preserving private and public \nproperty, far outweighs the Plaintiffs’ claim of entitlement to protest in locations where they have no \nlegal right to be, and while engaging in unlawful behavior.  The rights of free speech and assembly \ndo not mean the Dakota Access pipeline protesters can trespass on public or private property, or \nprotest on public bridges, streets, and highways without permission, whenever they choose to do so \nunder the guise of such activity being a “peaceful and prayerful protest.”  Simply stated, those who \nprotest on city streets while failing to obtain proper permits and permission from city authorities, or \nprotest on public bridges or rural highways closed to the general public, are in violation of the law.  \nSuch persons are subject to prosecution in the courts of the cities, counties, or states where the \nunlawful activity occurs.  The Court finds this Dataphase factor weighs against the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction. \n \nD.  THE PUBLIC INTEREST \nThe Plaintiffs have essentially asked the Court to find that their interests to protest (and \ntrespass) upon the Backwater Bridge and Highway 1806, near Cannonball, North Dakota, outweigh \nthe public interest in preserving and protecting the peace and rule of law.  Based upon a careful \nconsideration of all the evidence presented by the parties to date, the Court finds that the public \ninterest strongly weighs against the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  As previously noted, the \nrights of free speech and assembly do not mean, and have never meant, that everyone who chooses \nto protest against the Dakota Access pipeline may do so at any time, any place, and under any set of \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 99   Filed 02/07/17   Page 35 of 35\nconditions they choose in total disregard of the law.  To allow that to occur would result in anarchy \nand an end to the rule of law in civilized society.  This Dataphase factor weighs strongly in favor of \na denial of a preliminary injunction. \n \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nIt is not realistically possible to predict the dangers law enforcement officers and others will \nface in the future relative to the Dakota Access pipeline protests.  The protests have plagued western \nNorth Dakota for more than six months, with the resulting mayhem that has occurred on the \nBackwater Bridge, Highway 1806, the city streets, and rural highways.  The events that occurred on \nthe Backwater Bridge on November 20-21, 2016, are a tragedy.  All parties involved bear some \nresponsibility for the chaos that day.  However, it is clear the Plaintiffs and pipeline protesters had no \nconstitutional right to be present and engage in civil protest on the Backwater Bridge and Highway \n1806 on November 20-21, 2016.  Their presence was in clear violation of the law.  Under well-\nestablished Eighth Circuit law, the protesters bear the burden of proof, and bear the burden of \nestablishing the necessity of a preliminary injunction.  The Court concludes the Plaintiffs have not \nmet that difficult burden.   A careful consideration of the entire record, and the Dataphase factors, \nreveals the Dataphase factors do not weigh in favor of the Plaintiffs.  The Plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction (Docket No. 2) is DENIED. \n   IT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated this 7th day of February, 2017. \n            /s/ Daniel L. Hovland                    \n            Daniel L. Hovland, Chief Judge \n            United States District Court \n35 \n ",

This is a civil rights class action for damages, injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief arising from defendants' curtailment of plaintiffs’ First and \nFourth Amendment rights by their indiscriminate use of highly dangerous \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 2 of 43\nSpecialty Impact Munitions (SIM), explosive teargas grenades, teargas \ncanisters, and high pressure fire hoses and/or a water cannon, against \npersons engaged in protests and prayer ceremonies associated with \nopposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).  Plaintiffs are Native \nAmericans and other concerned citizens, known as “water protectors,” who \nhave protested and wish to continue protesting against DAPL as well as in \nopposition to other actions that endanger the environment and desecrate \nsacred lands.   \n2.  On November 20, 2016, the plaintiffs gathered, along with a number of \nothers, to pray and to peacefully protest the continued construction of DAPL \nand the ongoing blockage to through traffic of public highway 1806 by the \nState of North Dakota’s closing of portions of public highway 1806 south of \nMandan, which resulted in reduced vehicular access to Standing Rock \nReservation.   \n3.  At Backwater Bridge, a bridge on Highway 1806, just north of where \nmany of the Water Protectors were camped, plaintiffs engaged in peaceful \nFirst Amendment protected activities in a lawful public forum area on or \nnear the bridge that was open and available to pedestrian assembly. \nPlaintiffs did not cross into the area north of the bridge that was marked and \nseparated by a police barricade and closed to entry and assembly. \n4.  The area in which plaintiffs assembled was not stripped of its public \nforum character, and even were defendants to have had a lawful basis to \nexclude persons from this public space, they did not adequately or sufficiently \ncommunicate that the public forum was closed to pedestrian assembly or \notherwise issue an order to plaintiffs to disperse. \n5.  Defendants assembled on the north side of the bridge behind a police-\nconstructed barricade.  This assembly included a joint force of officers from \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 3 of 43\nthe Morton County Sheriff’s Department, City of Mandan Police Department, \nStutsman County Sheriff's Department and Doe unknown local law \nenforcement agencies subject to discovery.  \n6.  Defendants brought armored vehicles and were armed with an arsenal \nof dangerous implements and devices, including SIM, explosive teargas \ngrenades, other chemical agent devices, and a water cannon and/or fire hoses \nwhich were mounted on an armored vehicle.  \n7.  The defendants did not give orders to disperse or warnings before the \ndefendants indiscriminately used these weapons to inflict excessive force on \nthe plaintiffs and other peaceful unarmed water protectors, all of whom were \non the south side of the police barricade, including soaking them in water \ndespite the subfreezing temperature. On this night, over 200 water \nprotectors, including plaintiffs, were injured by indiscriminate and excessive \npolice force, causing some of the plaintiffs to suffer life altering injuries.   \n8.  This was not the first or the last time defendants attacked water \nprotectors who were praying and peacefully exercising their right to protest \nunder the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  However, November \n20th, represented defendants’ most brutal attack on plaintiffs of an \nincreasingly violent campaign by defendants to suppress and chill  \nconstitutionally protected rights.   \n9.  Defendants, including authorized policymakers of the Defendant \ngovernment entities, have taken no action to change the policies and \npractices that caused the civil rights violations complained of herein. In fact, \ndefendants have ratified those policies and practices by asserting that they \nare justified in maintaining their policy of using these dangerous weapons in \nan indiscriminate manner as a means of crowd dispersal.  \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 4 of 43\n10.  This ongoing policy and practice results in the chilling of plaintiffs' \nrights to freedom of speech and freedom of association. Accordingly, plaintiffs \nseek an injunction to curtail the unlawful use of excessive force in the form of \nindiscriminate use of SIM, explosive grenades, chemical agents, and water \ncannons or hoses on peaceful persons as means of crowd dispersal, without \nlawful order, prior notice and opportunity to disperse, as well as damages. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This action seeks damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1981 & 1983.  This court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action \nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  It has supplemental jurisdiction over the \nstate law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  This court also has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201 as this action is filed to obtain \ndeclaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of the actions and policies of \nlocal government. \n12.  Venue properly lies within this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  The \nnamed defendants perform their official duties in this District, and the events \nand omissions giving rise to plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \nIntradistrict venue is proper in the Western Division of the District of North \nDakota pursuant to D.N.D. Civ. L.R. 3.1 and Gen. L.R. 1.1 because the claims \nasserted herein arise from acts and/or omissions which occurred in Morton \nCounty, North Dakota. \nPARTIES \n13.

Each of the plaintiffs came to Standing Rock to support the peaceful \nprotest by the water protectors and the people of the Oceti Šakowiŋ (Seven \nCouncil Fires, or Great Sioux Nation) in opposition to the construction and \noperation of DAPL, which is desecrating their ancestral land and burial sites \nand threatening the environment and water.   \n15.  Defendant MORTON COUNTY is a body corporate for civil purposes \nand subject to suit pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code § 11-10-01. \n16.  Defendant KYLE KIRCHMEIER is a law enforcement officer, the \nSheriff and an authorized policymaker of Defendant MORTON COUNTY. \nKIRCHMEIER set in motion, supervised, directed, approved, ratified and \nacquiesced in officers’ constitutional violations at the November 20, 2016, \ndemonstration, including but not limited to, the use of indiscriminate and \nexcessive force and deprivation of the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights by \nMorton County officers and officers of other jurisdictions providing mutual \naid. KIRCHMEIER caused these violations by approving or acquiescing in \nthe use by defendants of dangerous weapons at the protest and by \nmaintaining the unconstitutional policy and practice of using dangerous \nweapons in an indiscriminate manner for crowd dispersal regardless of \nwhether persons subjected to this practice posed a threat justifying the force. \n17.  Defendant CITY OF MANDAN is a body corporate for civil purposes \nand subject to suit pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code § 40-01-02. \n18.

In 2014, Energy Transfer Partners proposed to construct a 1,172-mile \nlong Dakota Access Pipeline (hereinafter DAPL) to carry 570,000 barrels a \nday of highly volatile fracked crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North \nDakota to Illinois.  The pipeline was originally planned to cross the Missouri \nRiver, referred to as Mni Šoše by the Lakota people, north of Bismarck, but \ndue to concerns and public outcry by residents of Bismarck about \ncontamination to the water supply, the pipeline company, Dakota Access \nLLC, rerouted the pipeline.  As of the last census data available, Bismarck \nhad a population of 55,532 and of that, 94.78% are white. \nhttp://bismark.areaconnect.com.  The current pipeline route now crosses the \nMissouri River at Lake Oahe, the primary drinking water source for the \nStanding Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes, as well as thousands of \nother people who live in this area.  The Missouri River is sacred to the Oceti \nŠakowiŋ people and central to their ways of life and culture.  Lake Oahe is \nalso an area of great cultural, historic, religious, and spiritual significance to \nthe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and other \nmembers of the Oceti Šakowiŋ.   \n28.  DAPL’s path runs through Lakota ancestral and treaty lands known as \nthe Unceded Lands.  Lakota ancestral territories include all of the Dakotas \nand others.  The 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851 Treaty) entered into by \nthe United States and the Great Sioux Nation recognized all lands west of \nthe Missouri River in current day North and South Dakota as territory of the \nOceti Šakowiŋ.  11 Stat. 749 (Sept. 17, 1851).  The 1851 Treaty encompasses \nlands through which the DAPL is being and was constructed. In 1868, the \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 9 of 43\nUnited States entered into a second treaty with the leaders of the Great \nSioux Nation (1868 Treaty). 15 Stat. 635 (Apr. 29, 1868).  By Article XVI of \nthe 1868 Treaty, the United States stipulated that this territory would be \nconsidered unceded Indian territory, and stipulated that no white person \nwould be permitted to occupy or pass through it without consent of the \nIndians. These lands became essentially a buffer zone of “Indian territory” \nbetween the Great Sioux Reservation and the United States. The Oceti \nŠakowiŋ have never relinquished the Unceded Lands and under the terms of \nthe 1868 Treaty, cession of further territory could only occur by treaty signed \nby at least three fourths of all adult male citizens of the nation. The DAPL \nviolates both treaties. \n29.  When the United States licensed building of the DAPL across Unceded \nLands over the objections of the Oceti Šakowiŋ, the Standing Rock Sioux \nNation formally invoked the right of consent and issued a call to all Sioux \nand their allies to peacefully stand in support of the Nation’s sovereignty, \ntreaty rights, territorial rights to the Unceded Lands and to protect people’s \nessential water.  \n30.  DAPL threatens their environment, fish and wildlife, sacred ceremonial \nand burial sites, and vital water supply.  The Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has reported more than 3,300 \nincidents of leaks and ruptures at oil and gas pipelines since 2010. \n31.  In April 2016, Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Tribe members and \nother concerned citizens, known as “water protectors,” began protesting the \nDAPL.  Despite objections from the Tribes, construction of DAPL began in \nAugust, 2016, and water protectors gathered in increasing numbers in \nspiritually based protest camps near Highway 1806, south of Backwater \nBridge, some on private land on the Standing Rock reservation and some on \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 10 of 43\nfederal land with the permission of the United States Army Corps of \nEngineers. \n32.  On or about September 3, 2016, Standing Rock tribal officials informed \nthe federal government and DAPL construction managers that the proposed \npipeline construction was in direct conflict with traditional sacred areas and \nburial grounds.  DAPL declined to suspend construction and instead \naccelerated the destruction of these known areas by their construction.  In \nresponse, Indigenous leaders and water protectors went to a location where \nthe pipeline was being built to ceremoniously pray and to attempt to protect \nthe graves and sacred areas from permanent destruction and desecration.  \nDAPL security employees attacked water protectors who were protesting the \nbulldozing of sacred sites and burial sites with dogs and pepper spray. A \nnumber of protesters suffered injuries, including dog bites. Law enforcement, \nincluding MORTON COUNTY Sheriff personnel and other unknown officers, \nmonitored this incident but failed to intervene in the unwarranted and \nvicious attacks on peaceful protestors.  \n33.  In response to overwhelming tribal and public outcry against the \npipeline, on September 9, 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Army \nCorps”) withdrew an easement to drill and install a pipeline under Lake \nOahe and repeatedly requested that DAPL cease all construction within 20 \nmiles of Lake Oahe. Dakota Access, LLC ignored this repeated request by the \nArmy Corps. \n34.  Instead, Energy Transfer Partners hired military contractor TigerSwan \nto run an “information operations campaign” which included surveilling, \ninfiltrating or attempting to infiltrate, sowing divisions within and \nattempting to discredit the growing movement against DAPL, and engaged in \nefforts to falsely portray the water protectors as dangerous and violent \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 11 of 43\nincluding through a robust public relations campaign. According to public \ndocuments, TigerSwan coordinated and collaborated with Defendant law \nenforcement agencies. DAPL paid Tiger Swan to advance DAPL’s corporate \nand financial interests, not the public interest. TigerSwan was unlicensed in \nthe State of North Dakota. Nevertheless, defendant entities allowed this \nprivate paid contractor to operate in North Dakota and not only attempt to \ndefame the protestors who opposed DAPL but, additionally, to influence law \nenforcement actions against civilians protesting construction of the pipeline.  \nIn fact, defendants even allowed TigerSwan access to and participation in the \nJoint Operations Command Center.   \n35.  At the same time, from September, 2016, on, rather than defending the \npublic interest and halting DAPL’s illegal construction, defendants increased \ntheir use of force and arrests of water protectors, responding to nonviolent \nFirst Amendment expression in an increasingly militarized and violent \nfashion. On multiple occasions in October, defendants conducted \nindiscriminate and unlawful mass arrests of people who were exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights to voice their opposition to the proposed pipeline, \naccompanied by unjustified violence against nonviolent protesters. For \nexample, on October 22, 2016, defendants surrounded a peaceful prayer \nmarch and arrested 128 people without any warning or opportunity to \ndisperse. On October 27, defendants responded to a demonstration near \nhighway 1806 in Humvees and helicopters, unleashed a Long Range Acoustic \nDevice (LRAD) sound weapon, SIM, and chemical agents on peaceful water \nprotectors, and arrested 148 people, many of whom were engaged in prayer \nceremonies, including a number of elders who were strip searched and \ndetained in inhumane conditions for days.   \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 12 of 43\n36.  When the arbitrary mass arrests in October failed to deter all protests \nand expression of First Amendment rights, defendants resorted to even more \nviolent tactics.  On November 2, 2016, hundreds of protesters, including \nindigenous elders, held a prayer ceremony across a river from the pipeline \nconstruction site. When a few protesters entered the frigid river, defendants \nbombarded the entire group with tear gas and SIM, endangering their safety \nand health.  \n37.  Defendants responded to a November 15, 2016 DAPL protest on a \npublic roadway near a DAPL construction yard with widespread and \nindiscriminate use of chemical agents and stun guns.   \n38.  Prior to the incident at issue in this case, defendants closed an area of \nHighway 1806 north of the Backwater Bridge to access. As a barricade \ndemarcating where the road was closed and inaccessible, law enforcement \nofficials placed concertina wire, concrete barriers and two abandoned Morton \nCounty trucks north of Backwater bridge, chaining the trucks to the concrete \nbarriers. \n39.   Additionally, there were two rows of barriers running east-west across \nHighway 1806, twelve to fifteen feet apart, separated by three rows of \nconcertina wire, north of Backwater Bridge.  \n40.  Two “No Trespassing” signs, facing south, were placed behind the \nconcertina wire, north of the bridge, on the sides of the road. \n41.  There were no other signs posted in the immediate vicinity of the \nbridge designating any other areas of the road as off limits and thus \nphysically inaccessible, subject to trespass.  \n42.  While the highway was closed as a through road, only the area marked \nby the barricade and “No Trespassing” signs north of the bridge, was \nidentified as closed to pedestrians and assembly. There was no signage near \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 13 of 43\nthe south end of the bridge or anywhere on the bridge indicating that the \nbridge itself was designated as closed to physical access. There was no barrier \nindicating an area not to be crossed into, similar to the demarcation of the \narea running north of the bridge.  \n43.  At no time did defendants communicate to plaintiffs that the bridge \nwas closed to assembly. \n44.  On November 20, 2016, starting at approximately 6 p.m. and \nthereafter, in freezing temperatures, the plaintiffs and hundreds of other \nwater protectors went to the area of Backwater Bridge, south of the barricade \nand “No Trespassing” signs, to engage in First Amendment activity, including \nprayer and peaceful protest, of the law enforcement blockade of Highway \n1806 north of the bridge and the DAPL under construction nearby. \nJournalists also went to the area to document the events, and later, medics \nwent to attend to the injured. \n45.  Plaintiffs are people of indigenous descent and those allied in support \nof the indigenous people’s struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline. All of \nthe plaintiffs went to the Backwater Bridge and intended to engage in First \nAmendment activity. \n46.  The plaintiffs and all members of the proposed Class remained south of \nthe law enforcement barricade at all times relevant hereto. \n47.  The law enforcement officers, at all times relevant hereto, remained \nnorth of and behind the barricade of concertina wire, concrete barriers, and \nvehicles. \n48.  On the night of November 20-21, 2016, plaintiffs did not receive actual \nwarnings or orders to disperse. \n49.  A single announcement was made by defendants at 6:23 pm, before \nmost of the protectors arrived at the bridge.  The announcement did not tell \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 14 of 43\npeople to leave the area, but rather to stay off the bridge and to remain south \nof the river shoreline.  \n50.  This ephemeral and temporal communication to a handful of persons at \nan earlier time does not constitute a lawful order or warning to the plaintiffs \nand many others who arrived later and cannot be imputed as issued to them. \n51.  After that time, defendants did not issue warnings or orders to disperse \nto those present in the area and subjected to defendants’ use of force.  \n52.  From at least 7:00 p.m. on, no defendants nor any law enforcement \nofficer gave any amplified orders to disperse or other general instructions to \nthe plaintiffs and assembled crowd, and none of the plaintiffs heard a \ndispersal order or directive to leave the area in which they were present. At \nleast one person heard a command to \"step back\", but there was no time to do \nso before defendants shot SIM and other weapons into the crowd. \n53.  Although defendants possessed the means and the opportunity to issue \nany such order or warning to those assembled and to those subject to their \nindiscriminate use of force, they chose not to do so prior to use of force.  \n54.  Defendants and other law enforcement officers unleashed a barrage of \nfreezing water, chemical agents, SIM, and explosive grenades directed toward \nthe entire crowd, for many hours, throughout the night and into the early \nmorning.  \n55.  Defendants indiscriminately shot, launched, and sprayed their weapons \non all persons who were present in the general area of Backwater Bridge.  \n56.  Defendant used this force excessively and gratuitously against \nplaintiffs and others engaged in First Amendment protected activities despite \nthe fact that they were not threatening or attacking the officers or attempting \nto breach the barricade.  \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 15 of 43\n57.  The force of the water and munitions knocked most of the plaintiffs and \nmany of the other assembled persons off their feet and otherwise restricted \ntheir freedom of movement by stopping them in their tracks and causing \ninjuries. Clouds of chemical agents caused some of the plaintiffs and other \nassembled persons to be unable to escape or move either north or south off \nthe bridge at certain times. Still others were temporarily stopped from \ngetting to injured persons to aid them and helping them to safety.  \n58.  Persons who were attempting to leave to the south, as well as people \nwho were standing still, were all indiscriminately attacked with the cold high \npressure water, chemical agents, explosive grenades and impact munitions.. \n59.  Defendants egregiously restrained and intruded upon the liberty and \nprivacy of plaintiffs by their show of force in striking plaintiffs about their \nbodies with munitions and explosives, assaulting plaintiffs with chemical \nagents in their eyes, noses and mouths, and drenching plaintiffs with water \nthat froze plaintiffs’ hair and clothing. \n60.  The plaintiffs and other people on the bridge were variously praying, \nsinging, chanting, protesting verbally, aiding others, taking photos and video, \nstanding still, and walking around. It was apparent that the crowd consisted \nof individuals engaged in individual activity and was not acting as a \nmonolithic unit or moving as a group toward the barricade.  \n61.  Among all the people present on the bridge, there was one single \nindividual  who sought to breach the law enforcement barricade by climbing \nover the concertina wire. Law enforcement immediately arrested and \nremoved that person.  \n62.  Over the course of ten hours, there was one officer who suffered an \nundefined minor injury. The officers remained at all times north of the \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 16 of 43\nbarricade and were never subject to any attempt to overrun them or any \nother threat. \n63.  By contrast, many plaintiffs and other peaceful water protectors were \nseriously injured and/or suffered hypothermia, including the specific injuries \nset forth below in the sections describing each of the plaintiff’s experiences.  \n64.  The vast majority of the crowd remained at a distance from the \nbarricade, and those closest to it were simply standing, demonstrating, and/or \npraying or singing, and not trying to cross the barricade or assault the \nofficers. At no time did any of the plaintiffs or class members present a threat \nor do anything to justify defendant's use of force against them. \n65.  Defendants’ actions deprived plaintiffs of their rights to freedom of \nspeech, freedom of association, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press; \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; to be free from the use of \nexcessive and/or arbitrary force; and to be free from unreasonable, summary \npunishment, all guaranteed by the United States Constitution. \nFACTS SPECIFIC TO THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nVanessa Dundon \n66.  Vanessa Dundon came to the water protectors’ camp on September 11, \n2016, to stop the pipeline’s desecration of ancestral, sacred and burial sites \nand its threat to the environment and water supply and stand up for \nindigenous peoples’ rights.  \n67.  On Sunday, November 20, 2016, Ms. Dundon went to Backwater Bridge \nimmediately north of Oceti Šakowiŋ camp on Highway 1806 to peacefully \nprotest to protect the water.  It was very cold outside.  When she arrived at \nthe bridge in the early evening, there were very few people present.  \n68.  At that point, a small number of people were using tow equipment in \nan attempt to move one of the burned out trucks that was blocking the \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 17 of 43\nhighway. Ms. Dundon was not a participant in this activity. She did not hear \nlaw enforcement make any announcements or orders or any communication \nbetween the individuals who were trying to tow the truck and law \nenforcement. \n69.  Ms. Dundon was concerned for the safety of bystanders in the roadway, \nand began trying to get them out of the path of the vehicles. She saw a \nwoman who appeared to be a journalist standing by herself close to the \nconcertina wire barricade and a line of law enforcement officers who had \nformed on the other side. Dundon told the journalist to move out of the way.  \nAt that moment, she and Dundon were about ten to 20 feet from the \nbarricade and were the people closest to the line of law enforcement officers. \nAs Dundon watched the journalist move to the side of the road, she heard the \nsound of a weapon being fired, looked up, and saw a tear gas canister coming \nstraight for her face.  It was burning, and about a foot from her face when she \nsaw it, and she did not have time to move to avoid being struck in the face \nand right eye by the canister.  \n70.  When Dundon was shot in the eye, she turned around to run away.  \nShe was then shot in the back of her left leg right below her butt with a \nrubber bullet.  The shot with the bullet caused her to fall down.  Dundon \ncalled out for help and two water protectors grabbed her arms and helped her \nreach a minivan.  Dundon's eye was bleeding profusely and she could not see.  \n71.   Ms. Dundon was one of the first people injured on the bridge, and thus \nno ambulances had been summoned to Oceti Šakowiŋ camp yet. She had to be \ntransported by volunteer camp medics in the minivan. At the medic yurt at \nOceti Šakowiŋ, volunteers placed butterfly sutures on her eye to stop the \nbleeding. Ms. Dundon was then transported to the Emergency Room at \nSanford Hospital in Bismarck, North Dakota.  There, she was seen by an \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 18 of 43\nophthalmologist who put several stitches in her eye. She was kept overnight \nin the ER.  \n72.  Ms. Dundon was eventually told that her eye injury was very serious \nand that her retina was likely detached or would detach in the near future as \na result of the injury. She was referred to a specialist in Minnesota for \nfurther treatment, but surgery had to wait until the swelling went down. The \ndoctor initially advised her not to return home to Arizona because of the \nelevation difference, not to lift anything, cough too hard or otherwise put \npressure on her eye. The doctor said that the trauma to her eye would likely \naffect her vision for the rest of her life. Dundon's eye was in severe pain.  \nThere was an almost constant throbbing and pressure in her eye.   \n73.  Ms. Dundon has had a series of three surgeries to re-attach her retina \nas a result of defendants' act of shooting her in the eye. She has regained \nsome very limited vision, but has a significant permanent vision loss and \nongoing anxiety and distress that have affected her daily activities and \nability to work.  \n74.  Defendants did not issue a warning or order to Dundon prior to \nsubjecting her to force and injury.  \n75.  Ms. Dundon continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to \npeacefully and lawfully assemble and express her views and religious beliefs \nin opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline and related issues in Morton \nCounty and nearby locations in North Dakota, but the defendants’ \nindiscriminate and excessive use of munitions, chemical agents and/or water \nspray is causing her to refrain from such intended expressive activities \nbecause she is afraid that they will injure her again by such indiscriminate, \nunlawful and/or excessive use of force that harmed her and other persons \nengaged in lawful and peaceful activity.  \nDundon v.

Jade Kalikolehuaokalani Wool is of Native Hawaiian and Oglala \nLakota heritage. Wool came to the water protector camp in August 2016.  As \nan indigenous woman, she believed she needed to be at the camp in solidarity \nwith the water protectors and to uphold tribal sovereignty rights.   \n77.  On Sunday, November 20, 2016, in the evening, Wool went to the \nbridge immediately north of the Oceti Šakowiŋ camp on Highway 1806 to \npeacefully gather to protest construction of the pipeline underneath the \nMissouri River. Ms. Wool observed many law enforcement officers and \nmilitary vehicles on the other side of the bridge, behind the concertina wire \nand barricades.  When she arrived at the bridge, she could hear people \nscreaming and could see flashes from explosions.  A few minutes after she \narrived, a grenade loudly exploded in the air right above her head. The noise \nof the explosion caused Ms. Wool to temporarily become dazed and lose \nhearing. \n78.  Ms. Wool was also sprayed directly by the fire hoses and/or water \ncannon. The force of the torrent of water pushed her backward and she was \ncompletely soaked. Even her boots were filled with water.  The officers \nsprayed the hoses and/or water cannon into the crowd for about ten minutes \nat a time in the freezing night air.  Without explanation or warning, \ndefendants would stop for a few minutes and then start again.  This went on \nfor an hour that Wool was on the bridge attempting to engage in peaceful free \nspeech activities.   \n79.  Wool was never issued any warning or order from law enforcement, \nincluding an order to disperse. Wool did not fail to comply with any order. \nWool wished to peacefully engage in First Amendment protected activity.  \n80.  She saw a water protector who looked like he was injured and was \ncrawling on the ground.  Other water protectors tried to pull him away from \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 20 of 43\nthe water and while they were doing this, an officer kept spraying water at \nthe injured man on the ground. Ms. Wool located a plastic lid from a storage \ntote, and tried to shield the injured man from the water.  She saw the officer \nshooting the water look directly at her before he hit her again with the water.  \nAt one point, the force of the water knocked the plastic lid into her head.   \n81.  Soon after that, another grenade exploded in front of Ms. Wool’s face.  \nPieces of the grenade hit Wool’s face in several places.  The grenade burned \nher face and knocked her to the ground.  After the grenade hit her, she was in \nshock and could not talk or respond to others around her.  She remembers \nbeing put in a truck and being taken to the medical tent at Oceti Šakowiŋ \ncamp.  She was then transported to the hospital in Bismarck.  The doctors \nhad to cut off her clothes and hook her up to an IV.  Her body ached, and her \nhead hurt.   \n82.  Ms. Wool was traumatized and shaken by what happened that night.  \nShe could barely eat for days and suffered headaches, nervousness and \nanxiety. She could not sit still very long or sleep through the night and \ncontinued to feel cold all the time for quite some time. \n83.  Ms. Wool continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to peacefully \nand lawfully assemble and express her views and religious beliefs in \nopposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline and related issues in Morton County \nand nearby locations in North Dakota, but the defendants’ indiscriminate \nand excessive use of munitions, chemical agents and/or water spray is \ncausing her to refrain from such intended expressive activities because she is \nafraid that they will injure her again by such indiscriminate, unlawful and/or \nexcessive use of force that harmed her and other persons engaged in lawful \nand peaceful activity. \nCrystal Wilson \nDundon v.

Crystal Wilson is of Blackfoot and Afro-indigenous heritage. She came \nto the water protectors’ camp in late September, 2016, to gather with other \nindigenous people. At the camp, she volunteered and participated in peaceful, \nprayerful actions. \n85.  On Sunday, November 20, 2016, around 7:00 p.m., Ms. Wilson went to \nthe bridge immediately north of Oceti Šakowiŋ camp on Highway 1806 to \npeacefully protest the pipeline and pray with other water protectors. Police \nwere shooting high pressure water, tear gas canisters and explosive grenades \nat her and other peaceful, unarmed water protectors.  After about an hour, \nshe left and then later returned to the bridge with warmer clothing to \ncontinue to engage in peaceful First Amendment protected activities.   \n86.  When she returned, a native elder was singing an indigenous song with \nhis arms outstretched on either side, and the police were soaking him with \nthe water, even though it was very cold outside.  Ms. Wilson held a piece of \nplastic up to shield others so that they could engage in peaceful First \nAmendment activities. Then, she heard a bang and was struck in the chest by \na SIM or other projectile. She also she noticed that her hair and back were \ncovered in ice from defendants’ soaking her in water.   \n87.  Ms. Wilson was never issued any warning or order from law \nenforcement, including an order to disperse. Wilson did not fail to comply \nwith any order. Wilson wished to peacefully engage in First Amendment \nprotected activity.  \n88.  As a result of defendants’ actions, Ms. Wilson has suffered pain and \ntrauma which are still continuing at the present time. \n89.  Ms. Wilson continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to \npeacefully and lawfully assemble and express her views and religious beliefs \nin opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline and related issues in Morton \nDundon v.

David Demo is of Penobscot heritage. Demo is a supporter of the \nmovement to stop DAPL who came to the water protectors’ camp in mid-\nAugust 2016, to protest the pipeline’s desecration of ancestral sacred and \nburial sites and its threat to the environment and water supply.   \n91.  On Sunday, November 20, 2016, around 8:30 or 9 p.m., Mr. Demo went \nto the bridge immediately north of Oceti Šakowiŋ camp on Highway 1806 to \npeacefully observe what was going on and document the events with a GoPro \ncamera. \n92.  Mr. Demo was holding his “GoPro” camera on a stick, filming the police \nand the spraying of water. Within minutes, he was targeted with the water \nand was thoroughly soaked for about thirty seconds, even though he was not \nthreatening the police or barricade in any way.  He was not issued orders to \nget off the bridge or warnings that he would otherwise be assaulted with the \nwater or that projectiles would be fired against him.  As he attempted to \ncontinue filming the police misconduct, one of the officers targeted him and \nshot him with a SIM or other projectile in the middle finger of his right hand, \nwhich was holding the video camera on a stick.  \n93.  Mr. Demo went to the Indian Health Service (IHS) hospital in Fort \nYates at approximately 6:30 a.m. on November 21, 2016, to get treatment for \nhis hand where he had been shot.  The doctors told him he had several \nbroken bones, and that he would need reconstructive surgery.   \nDundon v.

He never heard, and he was never issued, an order to disperse while he \nwas on the bridge on the night of November 20-21, 2016.  He heard officers \nsay to step back from the barricade.  Demo complied with all police orders. \nDemo did step further back from the barricade when the officers requested it, \nbut he still was targeted with the water and munitions.   \n95.  The events of November 20-21 were very traumatic for Demo. It was \nshocking for Demo to observe and experience such brutal, cruel, unlawful and \nexcessive force by public officers.   \n96.  In addition to being subject to indiscriminate use of force, Demo was \ntargeted by defendants with unlawful force in retaliation for his First \nAmendment protected activity of recording their actions and conduct.  \n97.  Mr. Demo continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to \npeacefully and lawfully assemble and express his views and religious beliefs \nin opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline and related issues in Morton \nCounty and nearby locations in North Dakota, but the defendants’ \nindiscriminate and excessive use of munitions, chemical agents and/or water \nspray is causing him to refrain from such intended expressive activities \nbecause he is afraid that they will injure him again by such indiscriminate, \nunlawful and/or excessive use of force that harmed him and other persons \nengaged in lawful and peaceful activity. \nGuy Dullknife III \n98.  Guy Dullknife III is a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux Tribe and a \nresident of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The Oglala \nLakota is one of the seven nations, the Seven Council Fires, that compose the \nOceti Šakowiŋ. The Missouri River is a main water source for the Pine Ridge \nReservation.

He came to peacefully protest \nthe pipeline which may leak and cause harm to his community.   \n99.  On the evening of November 20, 2016, at around 10 or 11 p.m., Mr. \nDullknife went to the bridge over the Cannonball River on Highway 1806 \nnorth of Oceti Šakowiŋ camp to observe the prayer assembly. When he \narrived, he observed that the police were using water cannons and/or fire \nhoses to soak water protectors.  He observed a woman kneeling about twelve \nto fourteen feet from the barricade, and the police spraying the high pressure \nwater directly at her, knocking her down.  The police continued spraying the \nwoman while she was on the ground even though she posed no threat to the \npolice.  Another person helped Dullknife hold up a board to protect the \nwoman from the water and allow her to pray. \n100.  Mr. Dullknife was hit in the chest, stomach, and leg by what he \nbelieves were shotgun-fired beanbags or another SIM. He sustained pain and \nbruising.  \n101.  Mr. Dullknife observed the police shoot and injure many people that \nnight with SIM, chemical agents, and explosive grenades.  He overheard the \nofficers laughing and celebrating after they hit people with projectiles. \n102.  Mr. Dullknief was never issued any warning or order from law \nenforcement, including an order to disperse. Wilson did not fail to comply \nwith any order. Wilson wished to peacefully engage in First Amendment \nprotected activity.  \n103.    Mr. Dullknife continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to \npeacefully and lawfully assemble and express his views and religious beliefs \nin opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline and related issues in Morton \nCounty and nearby locations in North Dakota, but the defendants’ \nindiscriminate and excessive use of munitions, chemical agents and/or water \nDundon v.

Mariah Marie Bruce is a member of the Houma Nation. Ms. Bruce \narrived at Oceti Šakowiŋ camp in mid-October, 2016, and was present at \nseveral protests and prayer marches.  She has protested and wishes to \ncontinue protesting the desecration of ancestral sacred and burial sites and \nDAPL’s threat to the environment and water supply.  \n105.  On November 20, 2016, at about 6:30pm, Ms. Bruce went to the bridge \nimmediately north of the Oceti Šakowiŋ camp to peaceably protest DAPL. \nWhen Bruce got near the bridge,  she saw concertina wire barricade at the \nnorth end of the bridge with the police lined up behind it, marking the closed \narea north of the barricade.  She then walked to the front of the area open to \nassembly and was sprayed by police officers with a powerful stream of water, \nwhich continued throughout the entire time she was peaceably protesting at \nthe bridge. Her two inner jackets were wet, and her outer jacket and skirt \nwere frozen. At the end of the night she had trouble moving her hands.  Her \nhair was also frozen. The tear gas and/or other chemical agents burned her \neyes, nose and lungs.  \n106.  Ms. Bruce bent down to grab a lid to a plastic container to protect \nherself, and while she was bent over a police officer hit her in the genitals \nwith an explosive teargas blast grenade, which exploded on her body.  Ms. \nBruce did not feel any immediate physical pain in that area, and remained at \nthe protest for another 20-30 minutes before seeking medical attention. The \nmedics at Oceti Šakowiŋ camp gave her tea to help her body warm up, as she \nwas very cold. As her body began to warm, she started to feel pain in her \nDundon v.

The pain suddenly worsened and she began vomiting.  The \nmedics became very concerned. Bruce was put into an ambulance and taken \nto Sanford Hospital in Bismarck, North Dakota. \n107.  Ms. Bruce was never issued any warning or order from law \nenforcement, including an order to disperse. She did not fail to comply with \nany order. Ms. Bruce wished to peacefully engage in First Amendment \nprotected activity.  \n108.  Ms. Bruce continued to experience severe pain and difficulty walking \nfor many months after being shot. She is also concerned about how this injury \ncould impact her ability to have children in the future.   \n109.  Ms. Bruce continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to \npeacefully and lawfully assemble and express her views in opposition to the \nDakota Access Pipeline and related issues in Morton County and nearby \nlocations in North Dakota, but the defendants’ indiscriminate and excessive \nuse of munitions, chemical agents and/or water spray is causing her to \nrefrain from such intended expressive activities because she is afraid that \nthey will injure her again by such indiscriminate, unlawful and/or excessive \nuse of force that harmed her and other persons engaged in lawful and \npeaceful activity. \nFrank Finan \n110.  Frank Finan came to North Dakota to document DAPL’s desecration of \nancestral sacred and burial sites as a journalist, and because he is concerned \nabout environmental injustice. On November 20, 2016, in the evening, he \nwent to the bridge north of Oceti Šakowiŋ. On the other side of the bridge, \nFinan observed that there were police officers and many military-like \nvehicles. He could see water being aimed and shot at water protectors.  There \nwere two small campfires along the side of the highway, which were well \ncontrolled. He observed a constant flow of injured, wet water protectors being \nDundon v.

He saw canisters being \nthrown by the police, and he heard sounds like gunshots.   \n111.  While on the bridge, Mr. Finan was sprayed with a cloud of chemical \nagent that burned his eyes badly and made him cough.  He left the bridge to \nget away from the gas and to get his camera. When returned to the bridge, he \nbegan taking photos to document the police actions. While taking photos, he \nwas shot in the abdomen by a police officer with a rubber bullet or other SIM.  \nThe shot was so forceful that he was knocked to the ground. Some water \nprotectors helped him to get up, and he was taken to see medics. He suffered \npain whenever he tried to stand-up or sit-down for some time after this \nincident. \n112.  Mr. Finan was never issued any warning or order from law \nenforcement, including an order to disperse. He did not fail to comply with \nany order. Finan wished to peacefully engage in First Amendment protected \nactivity.  \n113.  Mr. Finan continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to \npeacefully and lawfully assemble, express his views in opposition to the \nDakota Access Pipeline and related issues and document protests in Morton \nCounty and nearby locations in North Dakota, but the defendants’ \nindiscriminate and excessive use of munitions, chemical agents and/or water \nspray is causing him to refrain from such intended expressive activities \nbecause he is afraid that they will injure him again by such indiscriminate, \nunlawful and/or excessive use of force that harmed him and other persons \nengaged in lawful and peaceful activity. \nIsrael Hoagland-Lynn \n114.  On November 20, 2016, at about 8:00 p.m., Israel Hoagland-Lynn went \nto the bridge over Highway 1806 north of Oceti Šakowiŋ camp to peacefully \nprotest the DAPL.  While on the bridge he was sprayed with water.  He left \nDundon v.

On his way back, he saw two Native Americans \ncrouching on the ground and was asked to help shield those individuals with \nplywood to protect them from getting shot by the water and SIM.  While \nholding the plywood to shield the Native Americans, Hoagland-Lynn was \ncontinually sprayed with the water cannon and/or fire hoses.  The police were \nalso shooting SIMs in his direction.  A water protector next to him was shot \nin the finger. When Mr. Hoagland-Lynn reached over to help the injured \nperson, Hoagland-Lynn was shot in the back by a SIM. \n115.  Hoagland-Lynn then looked up and saw an officer pointing a gun or \nlauncher at him.  He curled his head down and shielded his body with the \nplywood.  He was then hit by a SIM on the top of his head. He fell to the \nground and lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness, he felt a \nsignificant wound in his head. He was in severe pain. He was taken to the \nclinic at the Oceti Šakowiŋ camp where the medics tried to stop his bleeding.  \nHe was then transferred by ambulance to St. Alexius hospital in Bismarck.  \nAt the hospital, he was diagnosed with a laceration on his head, a chest wall \ncontusion from falling after being shot, and a large bruise on his back where \nhe was shot with the first munition.  His head wound required 17 staples to \nclose the laceration.  He suffered from pain in his head and back for some \ntime afterward. \n116.  Mr. Hoagland-Lynn was never issued any warning or order from law \nenforcement, including an order to disperse. He did not fail to comply with \nany order. Hoagland-Lynn wished to peacefully engage in First Amendment \nprotected activity.  \n117.

Plaintiff Noah Michael Treanor went to the bridge at about 7 p.m., to \npeacefully protest and to pray to stop DAPL. He stood there praying for about \na half hour when police officers started shooting at him with water and SIM.  \nMr. Treanor stayed in the same spot for at least two hours while the police \nshot him with the water and SIM. \n119.  Later, Treanor bent down on one knee to pray.  This time the police \nshot at him at a closer range with water, so he turned around and was shot in \nthe back of his legs with SIM. He turned facing the police again and kneeled \nand prayed.  Police officers again shot at him with the water and SIM while \nhe prayed.   \n120.  The police then began using two water hoses on Treanor at the same \ntime.  He rolled onto the grass at the side of the bridge and tried to shield \nhimself, and officers shot him in the head. He had a laceration to his head, \nand he was bleeding profusely.  Water protectors transported him to Oceti \nŠakowiŋ camp where he was put into an ambulance and transported to \nSanford Hospital in Bismarck. At the hospital, his head wound was stapled \ntogether.  He suffered a concussion and many bruises.  \n121.  Mr. Treanor was never issued any warning or order from law \nenforcement, including an order to disperse. He did not fail to comply with \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 30 of 43\nany order. Treanor wished to peacefully engage in First Amendment \nprotected activity. \n122.  Mr. Treanor is still suffering from post-concussion syndrome and \ntrauma at the present time.  \n123.  Mr. Treanor continues to desire, and possesses the intention, to \npeacefully and lawfully assemble and express his views in opposition to the \nDakota Access Pipeline and related issues in Morton County and nearby \nlocations in North Dakota, but the defendants’ indiscriminate and excessive \nuse of munitions, chemical agents and/or water spray is causing him to \nrefrain from such intended expressive activities because he is afraid that they \nwill injure him again by such indiscriminate, unlawful and/or excessive use of \nforce that harmed him and other persons engaged in lawful and peaceful \nactivity. \nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS \n124.  On December 2, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe asked the Inter-American \nCommission on Human Rights (IACHR) to stop the violence against water \nprotectors at Standing Rock. An official petition has been submitted to \nthe IACHR. \n125.  On December 4, 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced \nthat it would deny DAPL the easement to cross the Missouri River and \ninstead prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for alternative routes.  \n126.  On Jan. 18, 2017, the Army Corps began the Environmental Impact \nprocess by publishing a notice soliciting public comment inviting interested \nparties to identify potential issues, concerns, and reasonable alternatives \nthat should be considered in an EIS. \n127.  Also on January 18, 2017, defendants caused another water protector \nto be shot in the eye and face with SIM, similarly shot into a crowd of \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 31 of 43\nprotesters without notice or opportunity to disperse. The water protector \nsuffered very serious injuries requiring surgeries and is blind in that eye. \n128.  On Jan. 24, 2017, President Trump signed a memorandum calling for \nexpedited approval of DAPL. On February 8, 2017, the U.S. Army Corps \nwithdrew its objections and granted the easement to drill under Lake Oahe. \n129.  On February 15, 2017, Governor Burgum issued an evacuation order \nfor the Oceti Sakowin camp and on February 22, officers carried out the \neviction, arresting more than 50 people.  \n130.  On June 1, 2017, the DAPL began operating. It has leaked at least five \ntimes since then. \n131.  On June 14, 2017, the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia, found that the Trump Administration had violated environmental \nlaws when it hastily issued permits for DAPL to cross the Missouri River. In \nOctober, the Court declined a request to shut down the pipeline completely \nwhile this further review is taking place, but expressed a willingness to \nconsider alternative interim measures that would reduce risks pending the \ncompletion of a new environmental study. \n132.  On November 16, 2017, the Keystone Pipeline leaked 210,000 gallons of \noil in northeast South Dakota, stirring further public concern over the risks \nassociated with oil pipelines. \n133.    On December 4, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia imposed several interim measures on the DAPL operation in an \nattempt to reduce the risks of further spills. The Standing Rock, Cheyenne \nRiver, Oglala and Yankton Sioux Tribes are continuing to litigate to shut \ndown the DAPL. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n134.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all \npersons similarly situated, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   31 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 32 of 43\n(b)(1), (2), and (3). Plaintiffs seek certification of a class defined as follows:  \nAll persons who were shot or harmed by water, SIM, chemical agents, \ngrenades or other weapons on November 20, 2016, in the vicinity of \nBackwater Bridge, Highway 1806, North Dakota, on the south side of the law \nenforcement barricade. \n135.  The treatment to which plaintiffs, and the class they represent, have \nand will be subjected—being shot or injured with SIM, explosive grenades, \nchemical agents, and water cannons or hoses while engaging in First \nAmendment activities—were all performed pursuant to policies, customs, \nand/or practices of defendants. \n136.  By ordering officers to use unjustified indiscriminate force on the \ncrowd, and failing to adopt policies prohibiting such use of excessive force \nfollowing that event, defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable \nto the class, so that injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate respecting \nthe class as a whole. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), the \nmembers of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpractical. Plaintiffs do not know the exact number of class members. \nPlaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege that there are more \nthan 100 persons in the class defined above.  \n137.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are questions of law \nand fact common to the class, including but not limited to: \n•  Whether defendants’ use of SIM, water, chemical agents, explosive \ngrenades and other weapons on the plaintiff class constituted \nunlawful and/or excessive force under the Fourth Amendment; \n•  Whether defendants’ use of SIM, water, chemical agents, explosive \ngrenades and other weapons effected an unlawful restriction on \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   32 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 33 of 43\nand/or chill of the plaintiff class’ rights to freedom of speech, \nassembly and association and free exercise of religion in violation of \nthe First Amendment; \n•  Whether defendants are liable for violating the First and Fourth \nAmendment rights of the Plaintiff class; \n•  Whether defendants should be enjoined from continuing to use these \nweapons indiscriminately and as a mechanism of crowd dispersal \nincluding against peaceful persons and in the absence of lawful \ndispersal orders, warnings, or fair notice. \n138.  Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), plaintiffs’ claims \nare typical of the class they seek to represent.  The named plaintiffs and class \nmembers claim that their First Amendment rights have been chilled by the \nsame misconduct of defendants and are based on the same legal theories. \nPlaintiffs and the class members were all subjected to indiscriminate and \nexcessive force by being shot at or injured by SIM, explosive grenades, \nchemical agents, water cannons or hoses and other weapons intended to \nprevent them from exercising their right to peacefully protest and/or pray.  \nPlaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of injuries \nas the proposed class.  Each proposed class member suffered actual damages \nas a result of the challenged conduct.  \n139.  Plaintiffs’ counsels have the resources, experience, and expertise to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against defendants. Counsel know of no \nconflicts among any members of the class, or between counsel and any \nmembers of the class. \n140.  Pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 23(b)(3), upon certification, class \nmembers must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the \ncircumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be \nDundon v.

If this action is certified as a class \naction, plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class \nmembers, at such last known address by first class mail, as well as notice by \npublication informing them of the following: \ni.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the \nclass; \nii.  The nature of the action; \niii.  Their right to “opt-out” of the action within a given time, in which \nevent they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class \naction: \niv.  Their right to “opt-out” to be represented by their own counsel \nand to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be \nrepresented by the named class plaintiffs and their counsel; and \nv.  Their right, if they do not “opt-out” to share in any recovery in \nfavor of the class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on \nthe common issues adverse to the class. \nREQUISITES FOR RELIEF \n141.  As against Government Entity Defendants MORTON COUNTY, CITY \nOF MANDAN, STUTSMAN COUNTY, and DOE Government Entities, \nplaintiffs allege that the constitutional violations alleged herein were the \nproximate result of decisions, orders, acts and omissions of the Government \nEntity Defendants’ authorized policymakers including but not limited to \nKIRCHMEIER, ZIEGLER, and KAISER, who gave orders which caused the \nlaw enforcement officers at the scene to deploy dangerous weapons to the \nhighway blockade, including the armored car mounted water cannon and/or \nfire hoses, SIM, chemical agents, and explosive grenades, and to use those \nweapons in an indiscriminate manner against peaceful water protectors, \nmedics and observers, without lawful justification and based simply on their \nDundon v.

As against Government Entity Defendants MORTON COUNTY, CITY \nOF MANDAN, STUTSMAN COUNTY, and DOE Government Entities, \nplaintiffs allege that the constitutional violations described herein were the \nproximate result of said defendants' policies, customs, and/or practices that \npermit or are deliberately indifferent to violations of plaintiffs’ First, Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment rights secured by the U.S. Constitution.  These \ninclude but are not limited to policies, customs and practices which authorize, \nencourage, condone, ratify and/or acquiesce in the use of excessive force \nagainst protesters and water protectors; the use of chemical agents, high \npressure water, SIM and explosive grenades against non-violent persons; the \nfailure to properly and/or adequately train, supervise and/or discipline \nofficers with respect to the use of \"less lethal\" weapons, excessive force, \nconstitutional limitations on the use of force, and First Amendment rights; \nand/or other customs, policies and/or practices subject to continuing \ndiscovery. \n143.  The policies, customs and practices of defendants posed a substantial \nrisk of causing substantial harm to plaintiffs, and defendants were aware of \nthe risk. \n144.   Plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants MORTON \nCOUNTY, KIRCHMEIER, CITY OF MANDAN, ZIEGLER, STUTSMAN \nCOUNTY, KAISER, and DOES, and/or each of them, caused the violation of \nthe plaintiffs’ constitutional rights as a result of their supervisory \nmalfeasance and/or deliberate indifference to the need for more or different \nDundon v.

As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of defendants described \nherein, plaintiffs have been denied their constitutional, statutory and legal \nrights as stated below, and have suffered general and special damages, \nincluding but not limited to, constitutional damages, pain, suffering, \nhumiliation, emotional distress, fear, anxiety, disabilities, medical and \nrelated expenses, lost wages, and other damages in amounts according to \nproof.  \n146.  The individual defendants' acts were willful, wanton, malicious and \noppressive and done with conscious disregard and deliberate indifference for \nplaintiffs’ rights and safety, justifying an award of punitive damages.  \n147.   Defendants’ policies, practices, customs, conduct and acts alleged \nherein have resulted and will continue to result in irreparable injury to the \nplaintiffs, including but not limited to violations of their constitutional and \nstatutory rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete remedy at law \nto address the wrongs described herein. Plaintiffs intend in the future to \nexercise their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and association by \nengaging in peaceful protest, prayer, journalism, and other expressive \nactivities in Mandan County and North Dakota. Defendants’ conduct \ndescribed herein and their continuing defense and use of the policies at issue \nand failure to take adequate measures to prevent a recurrence of this \nconduct, has created fear, anxiety and uncertainty among plaintiffs with \nrespect to their exercise now and in the future of these constitutional rights. \n148.

An actual controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants in that \nplaintiffs contend that the policies, practices and conduct of defendants \nalleged herein are unlawful and unconstitutional, whereas defendants \ncontend that said policies, practices and conduct are lawful and \nconstitutional. Plaintiffs seek a declaration of rights with respect to this \ncontroversy. \n150.   Plaintiffs have incurred, and will continue to incur, attorneys’ fees and \ncosts in amounts to be determined according to proof. \n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nONE – FIRST AMENDMENT (42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n151.  The first claim is asserted by plaintiffs and the proposed class against \nall defendants. \n152.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations of the preceding \nparagraphs to the extent relevant, as if fully set forth herein. \n153.  Plaintiffs were engaging in constitutional-protected activity when \ndefendants, acting or purporting to act in the performance of their official \nduties as law enforcement officers, caused plaintiffs to suffer injuries that \nwould chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that \nactivity. Plaintiffs’ association with the water protectors and opposition to the \nDAPL were substantial and motivating factors for the defendants use of force \non them. The acts and/or omissions of the defendants, and each of them, \nindividually and/or while acting in concert with one another, chilled the \nplaintiffs’ rights to freedom of speech, expression and association and \nfreedom of the press, under the First Amendment to the United States \nDundon v. Kirchmeier  1st AMENDED CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS ACTION CMPLNT   37 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DLH-CSM   Document 129   Filed 02/27/18   Page 38 of 43\nConstitution. These actions were carried out pursuant to policy, practice and \ncustom of municipal defendants.  \n154.  Defendants’ coordination and collaboration with TigerSwan, the \nprivate, unlicensed contractor paid by DAPL to further its viewpoint and \nfinancial interests, also effected a content-based application of law and law \nenforcement in violation of plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.  \n155.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants’ actions, plaintiffs \nsuffered injuries entitling them to recover compensatory and punitive \ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief against the individual \ndefendants. \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for relief as hereunder appears. \n \nTWO - UNREASONABLE USE OF FORCE \n(Fourth & Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983) \n156.  The second claim is asserted by plaintiffs and the proposed class \nagainst all defendants. \n157.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations of the preceding \nparagraphs to the extent relevant, as if fully set forth herein. \n158.  Defendants, acting or purporting to act in the performance of their \nofficial duties as law enforcement officers, used unreasonable force on \nplaintiffs. The unreasonable force to which plaintiffs were subjected included \ndefendants’ shooting at them with SIM, explosive teargas grenades, teargas \ncanisters and other chemical agent devices, and water cannons and/or fire \nhoses in a subfreezing temperature, without justification. These actions were \ncarried out pursuant to policy, practice and custom of municipal defendants. \nDundon v.

The third claim is asserted by plaintiffs and the proposed Class against \nall defendants.  \n161.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations of the preceding \nparagraphs. \n162.  Defendants, acting under the color of state law, subjected plaintiffs to \nunequal protection of the law in violation of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \nThe unequal treatment to which plaintiffs were subjected was based on \nplaintiffs’ status as indigenous persons or association with indigenous \npersons and their political and religious beliefs in opposition to DAPL and \nfossil fuels, and includes the use of excessive force on plaintiffs when \nplaintiffs were attempting to exercise their constitutional rights. \n163.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants’ actions or inactions, \nplaintiffs suffered injuries entitling them to receive compensatory damages \nand declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, and punitive \ndamages against the individual defendants. \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for relief as hereupon appears. \n \nFOUR - DECLARATORY RELIEF \n(28 U.S.C. § 2201) \n164.  The fourth claim is asserted by plaintiffs and the proposed Class \nagainst all defendants. \nDundon v.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations of the preceding \nparagraphs to the extent relevant, as fully set forth in this Claim. \n166.  There presently exists an actual controversy within this Court’s \njurisdiction regarding whether or not defendants’ actions and inactions \ndescribed are lawful, pursuant to the First and Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiffs are interested parties \nbecause they were subject to actions and inactions described and, accordingly, \nseek a declaration of their rights concerning the legality of those actions and \ninactions to which they were subject. \n167.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants’ actions and inactions, \nplaintiffs suffered and are continuing to suffer injuries and chilling of their \nFirst Amendment rights, entitling them to receive declaratory and injunctive \nrelief against defendants. \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for relief as hereupon appears. \n \nFIVE - ASSAULT AND BATTERY \n168.  The fifth claim is asserted by plaintiffs and the proposed Class against \nall defendants. \n169.

Said acts by defendants and/or each of them were unreasonable and \nexcessive uses of force. \nDundon v.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \n175.   Defendants, and/or each of them, individually and/or while acting in \nconcert with one another, owed plaintiffs the duty to use reasonable care to \navoid causing foreseeable injury and damage to plaintiffs during the events \ndescribed in this Complaint The above-described acts and omissions of \ndefendants breached the duty of care defendants owed to plaintiffs. \n176.   In doing the acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, defendants and/or \neach of them, breached said duty to use reasonable care and said breach of \nduty caused, and/or contributed to the cause, of plaintiffs' injuries and \ndamages as alleged in this Complaint.  \n177.

Part of the dispute involves what defendants propose to\ndo in filing their response to plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, which, unless extended\nwas due on December 22, 2016.  Defendants advise that they want to restrict the identity of one or\nmore persons who will be providing affidavits in support of their response  to “attorneys eyes only”\nin order to safeguard them from retaliation.  In support, they have filed an affidavit in which it is\nclaimed that a number of law enforcement officers, government officials, and their families have\nbeen threatened and in some cases harassed because of their involvement or the involvement of\nfamily members in dealing with the activities arising out of the protests over the Dakota Access\nPipeline project. Plaintiffs object to keeping the names of the affiants confidential.  While plaintiffs\ndo not oppose an order that protects from public disclosure certain of the affiants’ personal\ninformation (e.g, their addresses and telephone numbers), they contend (1) there is no legal basis for\nthe relief that plaintiffs seek (including depriving the public of their right to know) and (2) the\ninability to discuss the names of the affiants with their clients and other witnesses will hinder their\nability to prosecute their case. \n1\n\nPursuant to its discussion with the parties on December 21, 2016, the court will take\nplaintiffs’ objections under advisement.

The Plaintiffs filed a Supplemental Brief in Opposition on August 11, \n2021. Doc. No. 275. The Defendants filed a Supplemental Reply in Support of the Motion on \nAugust 30, 2021. Doc. No. 283. For the reasons explained below, the Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment is GRANTED.  \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \n[¶2]  On November 28, 2016, the Plaintiffs filed a Complaint asserting claims against all \nDefendants for (1) Retaliation under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) Unreasonable Use of Force under the Fourth and \nFourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution;  42  U.S.C.  §  1983;  (3) \n[Unconstitutional]  Policies,  Customs,  or  Practices  under  the  First,  Fourth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (4) [Violations Resulting from] \nTraining, Supervision, or Discipline under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (5) Unequal Protection of the Law under the First, \nFourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; and (6) Declaratory Relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2201. Doc. No. 1.  \n[¶3]  That same day, the Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction, seeking:  \nan emergency order enjoining Defendants from curtailing their First and Fourth \nAmendment  rights  by  using  highly  dangerous  weaponry,  including  Specialty \nImpact  Munitions  (SIM,  also  known  as  Kinetic  Impact  Projectiles  or  KIP), \nexplosive “blast” grenades, other chemical agent devices, and a water cannon and \nwater hoses in freezing temperatures, to quell protests and prayer ceremonies \nassociated with opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 3 of 91\n \nDoc. No. 14, p. 1; see also Doc. No. 2. The Plaintiffs submitted twenty (20) exhibits in support of \nthis  Motion  for  Temporary  Restraining  Order.  Doc.  Nos.  14-1  –  14-20.  These  included  a \nWashington Post article titled, “The Latest: Sheriff defends spraying protestors with water”, a press \nrelease from the Morton County Sheriff’s Department titled “Protestors erect unlawful structures; \nshould seek appropriate winter shelter”, seventeen (17) declarations from individuals, including \nthe named-Plaintiffs, and a Report by the Physicians for Human Rights titled “Lethal in Disguise: \nThe health consequences of crowd-control weapons.” Id.  \n[¶4]  On December 1, 2016, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder on the basis the Plaintiffs’ counsel failed to comply with notice requirements under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(1) in that the Plaintiffs failed (1) to certify in writing they made \nefforts to give the Defendants notice, and (2) the Plaintiffs failed to provide reasons justifying why \nnotice to the Defendants was not warranted. Doc. No. 16, p. 2. The Court noted because the matter \n“is clearly a fact-specific case . . . notice to the adverse parties and an opportunity for them to \nrespond and be heard is necessary.” Doc. No. 16, p. 2. The Court ordered the Defendants to file a \nResponse to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction within fourteen (14) days after the Plaintiffs \nserved them with the Complaint, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, its brief, and supporting \ndocuments. Doc. No. 16, p. 2.  \n[¶5]  The same day, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Reconsider the Order Denying the \nTemporary Restraining Order, asserting they complied with the notice requirements of Rule \n65(b)(1).  Doc. No. 17. They also noted they did not seek the issuance of an ex parte order. Id. On \nDecember 8, 2016, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration, noting “the Court \nfinds that notice to the adverse parties and an opportunity to respond and be heard is necessary.” \nDoc. No. 31, p. 2 (emphasis in original).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 4 of 91\n[¶6]  On December 22, 2016, the Defendants submitted their Response to the Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction. Doc. No. 42. In support of the Response in Opposition, the Defendants \nattached numerous exhibits, including a map of the area in question, news releases, an emergency \ndeclaration by the Morton County Commissioners, criminal complaints, correspondence between \ngovernment officials, releases from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, an Executive \nOrder by the President, and affidavits of law enforcement involved in the matter. Doc. Nos. 43-\n60, 61-1 – 61-11. The Plaintiffs filed their Reply Brief on January 23, 2017, attaching an additional \ntwenty-nine (29) declarations of individuals, video clips of the November 20, 2016, incident, and \ninformation pertaining to crowd control policies. Doc. Nos. 81, 86, 91, 94. In the interim, on \nFebruary 6, 2017, the Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. Doc. No. 97.  \n[¶7]  On February 7, 2017, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nDoc. No. 99. The next day, the Plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal of the Order Denying the \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. Doc. No. 102. On February 17, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a \nMotion to Stay Proceedings Pending Interlocutory Appeal, which included staying the Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss and their pending Response in Opposition. Doc. No. 106. On February 22, \n2017, the Court granted the Motion to Stay Proceedings. Doc. No. 110. On November 14, 2017, \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Court’s denial of the Preliminary Injunction. Doc. \nNos. 111-112.  \n[¶8]  The stay was lifted on January 10, 2018. Doc. No. 113. The Court ordered the Plaintiffs \nto respond to the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Complaint by February 28, 2018. Doc. No. \n113. However, the Plaintiffs requested the Court first consider their Motion for Leave to Amend \nthe Complaint filed on February 1, 2018, as it would render the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nmoot if granted. The Court granted the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Complaint on February \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 5 of 91\n27, 2018, finding as moot the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. Doc. No. 128. The Plaintiffs filed a \nFirst Amended Complaint the same day. See Doc. No. 129.  \n[¶9]  The Amended Complaint alleges claims against all Defendants for: (1) [Violations of] \nthe First Amendment (42 U.S.C. 1983); (2) Unreasonable Use of Force (Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983); (3) Unequal Protection of Law; (4) \nDeclaratory Relief (28 U.S.C. § 2201); (5) Assault and Battery; and (6) Negligence. Doc. No. 129, \n¶¶151-177. The Plaintiffs also assert additional claims of (7) [Unconstitutional] Policies, Customs, \nor Practices under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, and (8) [Violations Resulting from] Training, Supervision, or Discipline under \nthe First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nDoc. No. 129, ¶¶141-150.  \n[¶10]  On April 6, 2018, the Defendants filed the initial Motion to Dismiss, which has been \nconverted now to a Motion for Summary Judgment. Doc. No. 135. On September 17, 2020, this \nCourt converted the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss into a Motion for Summary Judgment, \ndeferring a ruling on the Motion to allow for limited discovery. Doc. No. 151. On September 17, \n2020, the Court issued a limited discovery order outlining what discovery was permissible for each \nside. Doc. No. 154.  \n[¶11]  On October 7, 2020, the Defendants filed a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal to the Eighth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, arguing this Court erred by not ruling on the issue of whether the \nDefendants were protected by qualified immunity. Doc. No. 163. The same day, the Defendants \nfiled a Motion to Stay Proceedings while the matter was on appeal. Doc. No. 161. On November \n3, 2020, the Court granted the request to stay proceedings. Doc. No. 171. On November 25, 2020, \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the Defendants’ appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Doc. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 6 of 91\nNo. 173. This Court lifted the stay of proceedings on November 25, 2020, allowing limited \ndiscovery to move forward. Doc. No. 174. At the close of limited discovery, supplemental briefing \non the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed as noted above.  \nII.  FACTS  \na.  Undisputed facts  \n[¶12]  In 2014, Energy Transfer Partners (“ETP”) put forth a proposal to construct a 1,172-mile-\nlong pipeline, named the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”), to carry oil from the Bakken oil fields \nin North Dakota to Illinois. Doc. No. 129, ¶27. The DAPL was slated to cross the Missouri River \nin North Dakota at Lake Oahe, which sits north of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Reservation. \nDoc. No. 129, ¶27. In April of 2016, individuals, including members of the Standing Rock and \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribes, began protesting the construction of the DAPL, asserting the \nlocation of the DAPL threatened tribal  members’  “environmental, fish and wildlife, sacred \nceremonial and burial sites, and vital water supply.” Doc. Nos. 129, ¶30.   \n[¶13]  During the course of the prolonged DAPL protest, the protesters primarily occupied three \nareas: the Sacred Stone Camp and the Rosebud Camp located south of the Cannonball River, and \nthe Seven Council Fires Camp (i.e. Oceti Sakowin) located between the north bank of the \nCannonball River and the south bank of the North Branch of the Cantapeta Creek, a tributary of \nthe Cannonball River. The Sacred Stone Camp and Rosebud Camps are located in Sioux County, \nand  the  Seven  Council  Fires  Camp  is  located  in  Morton  County.  The  Backwater  Bridge \n(hereinafter referred to as “the Bridge”) is located on Highway 1806 and crosses the north branch \nof the Cantapeta Creek, north of the Seven Council Fires Camp.  \n[¶14]  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) manages the land upon which all \nthree camps were located. The Corps also manages federal lands in Morton County located along \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 7 of 91\nthe north bank of the North Branch of the Cantapeta Creek from the Backwater Bridge eastward \nalong the north bank of the Cannonball River eastward to the Missouri River. The Corps managed \nland located along the north banks, as well as privately-owned property to the north, which \nencompassed the DAPL project route and the location from which the DAPL project planned to \ncross the Missouri River. The DAPL project route was located less than one-mile north of the \nSeven Council Fires Camp. The Corps initially granted the protesters a permit to demonstrate on \nCorps-managed lands where the three camps are located. Doc. No. 61-9.  \n[¶15]  Protestors  began  gathering  in  increasing  numbers  in  August  of  2016  when  the \nconstruction of the DAPL began. Doc. No. 129, ¶31. On August 15, 2016, the Morton County \nBoard of Commissioners issued an “Emergency Declaration Dakota Pipeline Civil Unrest,” which \nimplemented Morton County’s emergency plans and processes in response to the protests. Doc. \nNo. 61-4. This included additional manpower, resources, and other expenditures to address the \nprotests. Doc. No. 61-4.  \n[¶16]  On August 19, 2016, then-Governor Jack Dalrymple (“Governor Dalrymple”) issued an \nExecutive Order regarding the protests. Doc. No. 58-2. The Order recognized citizens had the right \nto  “peacefully  and  lawfully  assemble  and  protest,”  but  also  recognized  there  was  “illegal \nprotesting” and “unlawful activity” threatening not only protestors, but also the general public and \nresponders. Doc. No. 58-2. As a result, Governor Dalrymple ordered “total utilization of the North \nDakota State Emergency Operations Plan (SEOP) in response to the situation in order to assist \nlocal and tribal officials, to implement appropriate law enforcement actions and future mitigation \nmeasures  to  maintain  peace  and  order,  and  to  limit  hardships  and  impacts  caused  by  the \nemergency.” Doc. No. 58-2.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 8 of 91\n[¶17]  Numerous arrests of protestors were made from August of 2016 through November of \n2016. The Court includes discussion of these earlier arrests because they show the prolonged \nencounters between law enforcement and protestors leading up to the November 20, 2016 protest. \nThe November 20, 2016, event cannot be considered in a vacuum, as these interactions between \nlaw enforcement and protestors became more intense as each one passed. Their effect upon the \nminds of officers may be important in determining whether an officer acted reasonably on \nNovember 20, 2016.  \n[¶18]  On August 31, 2016, law enforcement responded to a call of protestors crawling on \nconstruction equipment on the west side of Highway 6 south of St. Anthony. Doc. No. 61-2, \nDEF10. Officers ultimately arrested two individuals who had secured themselves to construction \nequipment for criminal trespass and obstruction of a government function, with one of them also \nbeing  charged  with  preventing  arrest.  Id.  In  addition,  law  enforcement  arrested  six  other \nindividuals for disorderly conduct and related charges. Id. \n[¶19]  On September 3, 2016, a confrontation occurred between protestors and private security \nofficers hired by Energy Transfer Partners. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF12. Law enforcement responded, \nbut the crowd of protestors left the scene without further incident. Id. No arrests were ultimately \nmade. Id. at 13. On September 7, 2016, the Morton County Sheriff’s Office announced the Morton \nCounty State’s Attorney had filed criminal complaints against two protestors for criminal trespass \nand criminal mischief on the allegation that they had entered private property on September 6, \n2016 and spray-painted graffiti on Caterpiller bulldozers belonging to another person. Doc. No. \n61-2, DEF15.  \n[¶20]  On September 8, 2016, Governor Dalrymple called upon a small number of North Dakota \nNational  Guard  personnel  to  support  law  enforcement  efforts  with  primary  responsibilities \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 9 of 91\nincluding traffic control points and administrative duties. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF16. He also placed \nadditional Guardsmen on standby alert. Id. By this point, the North Dakota Highway Patrol and \nnumerous county and city law enforcement had begun assisting Morton County. Doc. No. 61-2, \nDEF49.  \n[¶21]  On September 13, 2016, the Morton County Sheriff’s Office, North Dakota Highway \nPatrol, and other law enforcement agencies responded to calls for assistance by Dakota Access \nPipeline workers on the scene. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF19. Law enforcement ultimately arrested \ntwenty-two protestors for criminal trespass, including two who were bound to equipment used in \nthe Dakota Access Pipeline construction. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF19. On September 14, 2016, law \nenforcement was dispatched to another Dakota Access Pipeline construction site for a report of \nprotestors in the worksite. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF20. Officers arrested three individuals for felony \nreckless endangerment for being attached to DAPL construction equipment. Doc. No. 61-2, \nDEF20.  Officers  also  arrested  two  other  individuals  for  conspiracy  to  commit  reckless \nendangerment  and other misdemeanors for their alleged involvement in assisting protestors \nsecuring themselves to the equipment. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF20. A similar call for assistance with \nprotestors  placing  themselves  in  Dakota  Access  Pipeline  construction  sites  was  placed  on \nSeptember 14, 2016, and in total, officers arrested eight individuals for reckless endangerment and \nrelated offenses. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF20.  \n[¶22]  On September 27, 2016, officers responded to two separate calls of protestors assembling \non Dakota Access Pipeline construction sites; however, no arrests were ultimately made. Doc. No. \n61-2, DEF32. On September 28, 2016, officers arrested 21 protestors at two construction sites for \nvarious crimes such as criminal trespass, possession of stolen property, and resisting arrest. Doc. \nNo. 61-2, DEF34. During this encounter, one protestor was alleged to have charged at the police \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 10 of 91\nline on horseback. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF37. On October 3, 2016, a warrant was issued for this \nindividual for terrorizing and reckless endangerment related to the incident. Doc. No. 61-2, \nDEF37.  \n[¶23]  By October 5, 2016, ninety-five protestors had been arrested for activity related to the \nDAPL protests, and the arrests continued. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF37. In addition, on October 7, 2016, \nthe State of North Dakota made an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request to other \nstates for additional law enforcement support in responding to the DAPL protests. Doc. No. 61-2, \nDEF41. On October 14, 2016, law enforcement made 14 arrests at three different protest sites. \nDoc. No. 61-2, DEF42. The arrests included one individual charged with reckless endangerment, \ncriminal trespass, and inciting a riot for attaching himself to DAPL equipment. Doc. No. 61-2, \nDEF42. Additional arrests included ten individuals being arrested for disorderly conduct and \ndisobedience of public safety order during riot conditions. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF42. Three additional \nprotestors were arrested for trespass on private property. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF43. On October 14, \n2016, charges against six of the protestors related to the September 3, 2016 protest were dismissed. \nDoc. No. 61-2, DEF44.  \n[¶24]  Between Saturday October 21 and Sunday October 22, law enforcement arrested 127 \nindividuals for various crimes related to DAPL protest activities. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF50. Several \nprotestors were arrested for trespassing on private property located on the DAPL right of way \nknown as Cannonball Ranch. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF49. On October 23, 2016, the North Dakota \nDepartment of Transportation closed Highway 1806 due to protestors blocking the north and south \nbound lanes of the highway north of the protest camps, which included protestor-made roadblocks. \nDoc. No. 61-2, DEF48. A traffic control point was set up, and motorists were advised to use an \nalternative route. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF48. By October 23, 2016, several states had either already \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 11 of 91\narrived to assist Morton County or had pledged to do so. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF49. These states \nincluded Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, Indiana, and Nebraska. Doc. No. 61-2, \nDEF49. \n[¶25]  On October 26, 2016, Sheriff Kirchmeier and other state and local law enforcement \ntravelled to the protest site where the roadblocks were erected and requested protestors to vacate \nprivate property north of the Backwater Bridge and to remove protestor-created roadblocks. Doc. \nNo. 55, ¶¶ 5-6. On October 27, 2016, after the protestors remained on the private property, law \nenforcement began efforts to remove the protestors and blockades from the property. Doc. No. 55, \n¶¶12-21. Law enforcement personnel were able to move protestors south of the Backwater Bridge \nafter extensive effort. Doc. No. 55, ¶21. At that point, law enforcement placed and disabled two \nlarge military surplus dump trucks across the north side of the Bridge as a barricade. Doc. No. 55, \n¶21. Within 10 to 15 minutes of being placed on the Bridge, the two vehicles were set on fire, \nremaining on the Bridge in a burned-out condition. Doc. No. 55, ¶21. An additional vehicle and a \nNorth Dakota Department of Transportation (“NDDOT”) electronic sign were also set on fire \ntoward the north end of the Bridge. Doc. No. 54, ¶25.  \n[¶26]  The Mandan and Bismarck Rural Fire Departments responded to multiple fires. Doc. No. \n61-2, DEF63. In total, 141 protestors were arrested, charges included conspiracy to endanger by \nfire/explosion, engaging in a riot, and maintaining a public nuisance, and reckless endangerment \nfor individuals who used sleeping dragons to attach to items. Doc. No. 61-2, DEF65. In addition, \none protestor was arrested for attempted murder for firing three shots at law enforcement officers. \nDoc. No. 61-5. She was also charged with preventing arrest, carrying a concealed firearm, and \npossession of marijuana. Doc. No. 61-5. This protestor later pled guilty to a federal firearm charge \nand a charge of civil disorder.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 12 of 91\n[¶27]  On October 28, 2016, the NDDOT issued a press-release entitled “ND Highway 1806 \nBridge and roadway remain closed north of Cannonball due to Bridge damage.” Doc. No. 59-2. \nThe release stated:  \nThe North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) and North Dakota \nHighway Patrol will keep ND Highway 1806 and the Backwater Bridge located on \nND 1806 closed north of the Cannonball River until further notice. The highway \nBridge which travels over Cantapeta Creek north of Cannonball was damaged last \nnight when protesters placed vehicles and other debris and set items on fire on the \nBridge. \n \nThe Bridge is unsafe for anyone to cross and will remain closed until all damage to \nthe structure is evaluated by Bridge engineers. During the closure motorists need to \nuse alternate routes. \n \nDoc. No. 59-2.  \n \n[¶28]   On October 31, 2016, NDDOT personnel visually inspected the Backwater Bridge. Doc. \nNo. 58-1. Personnel noted concern with the third vehicle fire at the north end of the Bridge, \nincluding its location near beams. Doc. No. 58-1, p. 1. A full inspection was not completed, \nhowever, as personnel “did not feel comfortable with opening the Bridge at the time of visual \ninspection due to the uncertainty of the existing condition of the box beams and the inability to \naccess the area with most intense heat which [they] presume was under the vehicle.” Doc. No. 58-\n1, p. 1. The report indicated security of the area had been a concern, and their investigation was \nput on hold. Doc. No. 58-1, p. 1. The report indicated further testing would be completed once the \nNDDOT had access to a secure site. Doc. No. 58-1, p. 1. The report concludes by stating “[u]ntil \nthe inspection issues outlined above are completed and necessary repairs are made, the Department \ncannot guarantee the safety to the traveling public.” Doc. No. 58-1, p. 2.  \n[¶29]  On October 31, 2016, the NDDOT issued a press release titled “ND Highway 1806 \nBridge to remain closed north of Cannonball.” Doc. No. 59-3. This release states:  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 13 of 91\nThe North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) and North Dakota \nHighway Patrol will keep the ND Highway 1806 Bridge closed north of Cannonball \nuntil further notice. The highway Bridge (often referred to as Backwater Bridge) \ntravels over Cantapeta Creek north of Cannonball and will remain closed to traffic \nfor the safety of the traveling public because the structural integrity of the Bridge \nmay be compromised due to protesters lighting vehicles on fire on the structure.  \n \nThe Bridge is unsafe for anyone to cross and will remain closed until all damage to \nthe structure is evaluated by Bridge engineers. The NDDOT is currently making \narrangements for a Bridge inspection but is unable to implement the process due to \nongoing incidents in the area.  \n \nThe NDDOT appreciates the public’s patience with the process as it may take time \nto access, inspect, and make any necessary repairs to the Bridge.  \n \nDuring the closure motorists need to use alternate routes. \n \nDoc. No. 59-3.  \n \n[¶30]  On November 1, 2016, the Corps requested law enforcement assistance in removing \nprotestors from the Corps-managed lands located north and east of the Bridge. Doc. No. 61-7. The \nCorps indicated protestors were spotted on October 31, 2016, traveling by small boat up the North \nBranch of Cantapeta Creek to encamp on the Corps property north of the Bridge, which was \nlocated where DAPL was proposed to be constructed. Id. The Corps indicated it had not granted \nanyone permits or permission with respect to public use of Corps-managed lands located north of \nthe Cantapeta Creek or north and east of the confluence of the Cantepeta Creek and Cannonball \nRivers, extending to the Missouri River. Id.  In fact, the Corps stated that because that area was \nnot opened for use by the public for recreational or camping purposes, it considered “these \nindividuals to be trespassers.” Id. The Corps reiterated it was not seeking assistance to remove the \ninhabitants of Sacred Stone Camp, Rosebud Camp, or Seven Councils Camp. Id. \n[¶31]  On November 20, 2016, Law enforcement had already set up two rows of jersey barriers \nrunning east-west across Highway 1806, positioned approximately 12 to 15 feet apart. Doc. No. \n54, ¶35. Between the two rows of jersey barriers were three rows of concertina wire, with one row \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 14 of 91\nlying atop two ground level rows. Id. The two burned out law enforcement vehicles on the Bridge \nwere located next to, and south of, the jersey barriers and concertina wire barricades located on \nthe north side of the Bridge. Id. The burned-out law enforcement trucks were chained with large \nlog chains to the concrete Jersey barriers. Id.  \n[¶32]  Law enforcement officers warned protestors in the time leading up to the November 20, \n2016 protest not to remove the burned-out trucks off the Bridge. In one video, law enforcement \nofficers are heard telling a small number of protestors standing on the burned-out vehicles early in \nthe day that law enforcement would be moving toward them to speak. See Doc. No. 93, Video \ntitled “Tense standoff at Standing Rock after Semi Truck comes to cl-1]”. Officers are seen moving \nfrom north, onto the Bridge, and then up to the wire by the vehicles. Id. One law enforcement \nofficer asks the protestors “what’s the deal with the semis?” Id. A semi-truck is seen backed up on \nthe south side of the Bridge. Protestors are heard saying the semi was “sitting on the Bridge.” Id. \nThe Officer, referencing the two burned out trucks, states to the protestors the NDDOT was to \ndetermine when the vehicles were to be removed from the Bridge. Id. The Officer is heard saying \nto  the  protestors  “those  trucks  don’t  come  out  of  here,”  further  noting  “it  makes  us  [law \nenforcement] nervous when you bring a semi out there like that.” Id. One protestor is heard saying \n“they are not coming out today.” Id. The Officer states “they start getting tugged on, they start \ngetting pulled on, it’s going to get pretty tense . . . for everyone involved.” Id. One protestor \nresponds, “we know.” Id. The Officer states “the Bridge has to be inspected . . . the whole works.” \nId.  The officers retreat to the north side of the Bridge, while the protestors remain standing on and \nin the burned-out trucks. Id.  \n[¶33]  It is undisputed interactions between law enforcement and protestors began early in the \nday on November 20, 2016. Protestors used a semi-truck and large bolt cutter to cut the chain \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 15 of 91\nsecuring one of the two burned out dump trucks located in the west most lane. See Doc. No. 91, \nVideo, titled “642034911” (hereinafter titled “Unicorn Riot Video”). The Unicorn Riot Video’s \naudio displays protestors discussing the removal of the first vehicle and the intended removal of \nthe second vehicle. See Doc. No. 91, “Unicorn Riot Video.” A protestor is heard saying at the \nbeginning of the video: \nSo, what’s happened is three weeks now they said they were going to clear this \nBridge. They say they have the blockade here for our safety because the Bridge is \nunsafe. If the Bridge is unsafe, the blockade should be on the south. They didn’t \nuphold their end of the deal, so we are clearing the Bridge. \n \nDoc. No. 91, “Unicorn Riot Video”, at 00:01-:00:18.  \n \n[¶34]  The video then depicts protestors securing chains to the burned-out truck, pushing the \ntruck as it is pulled by a semi-truck, and removing it away off the south side of the Bridge. See \nDoc. No. 91, “Unicorn Riot Video”, at  00:17-:00:36.  Less-lethal  munitions  are seen being \ndeployed against protestors, with one protestor throwing a spent chemical munition canister back \nat law enforcement. Video footage taken by Plaintiff Finan shows protestors yelling “throw it \nback” and cheering after this individual throws it to law enforcement’s side. Doc. No. 246, Exhibit \nC “Finan Frank Dep Exhibit 45.”  \n[¶35]  It is undisputed that law enforcement officers used less-lethal munitions during the \nNovember 20, 2016 protest. It is also undisputed that during the protest on November 20, 2016, \nlaw enforcement issued two “Code Red” requests asking for assistance from all available law \nenforcement within a 100-mile radius. Doc. No. 54, pp. 11, 12. Later, a “Signal 100,” went out \nrequesting all available law enforcement, state-wide, to immediately come and provide assistance \nto law enforcement. Doc. No. 54, p. 14.  \n[¶36]  On November 25, 2016, the Corps notified the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe it was closing \nthe Corps-managed land located north of the Cannonball River, an area encompassing the Seven \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 16 of 91\nCouncil Fires Camp, to all public access and use, effective December 5, 2016. See Doc. No. 61-\n11.  The Corps advised anyone found on the property after December 5th would be considered \ntrespassing and subject to prosecution.  The Corps said the decision was necessary to protect the \ngeneral public from the dangerous confrontations between protesters and law enforcement officials \nwhich had occurred in the area, and to reduce the risk of harm to people in the encampments due \nto the harsh North Dakota winter conditions. See Doc. No. 61-11.  The Corps also established a \nfree speech zone located south of the Cannonball River for use by the protesters—an area more \naccessible to emergency services. Id.  \n[¶37]  However, on November 28, 2016, pursuant to Executive Order 2016-08, Governor \nDalrymple ordered the immediate mandatory evacuation of all persons occupying areas managed \nby the Corps located in Morton County due to severe winter conditions and ordered no person \nshall return to the evacuation area. See Doc. No. 61-8.  The evacuation area encompassed the \nSeven Council Fires Camp located immediately south of the Bridge.  Despite the Governor’s order, \nprotesters remained in the evacuation area, but eventually, protestors left all camps in 2017.  \nb.  Plaintiffs’ version of events  \n[¶38]  Plaintiffs assert in their Amended Complaint “[t]here was no signage near the south end \nof the Bridge or anywhere on the Bridge indicating that the Bridge itself was designated as closed \nto physical access,” and “at no time did defendants communicate to plaintiffs that the Bridge was \nclosed  to  assembly.”  Doc.  No.  129,  ¶¶42-43.  Plaintiff  Dundon  asserts  she  never  saw  “no \ntrespassing on Bridge” signs at the Backwater Bridge. See Doc. No. 239-1, pp. 103-104, Dundon \nDeposition, (“I never even seen those. Like, why are they way over there? I never seen the \ntrespassing – no trespassing on Bridge ever. And I was always up there, and I never seen that \nsign.”). Plaintiffs Finan, Demo, and Dullknife all likewise assert they did not see the signs. See \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 17 of 91\nDoc. No. 239-8, p. 89, Finan Deposition, (“God as my witness, I did not see that sign when I was \nthere. I only saw it after I saw the photographs.”); Doc. No. 239-4, pp. 131-132, Demo Deposition, \n(“Nobody ever told us that we weren’t allowed to be on the Bridge, including police officers, and \nnone of the police officers ever told any of the protesters that were on the Bridge before the 20th \nthat they weren’t allowed to be there. There were no signs on the protestors’ side, and to best of \nknowledge, any signs that I could see stating that we weren’t allowed to be on that Bridge. . . There \nwere no signs that I saw.”); Doc. No. 239-7, p. 108, Dullknife Deposition, (“I didn’t see anything \nlike that,” in response to “At any point in time did you see any sign saying no trespassing on the \nBridge?”).  \n[¶39]  Plaintiffs and protestors further contend they were not audibly or physically warned by \nlaw enforcement at any time they were not supposed to be on the Bridge on November 20, 2016. \nSee Doc. Nos. 81-2, ¶26, 81-3, ¶13, Doc. No. 81-4, ¶¶7, 18, Doc. No. 81-6, ¶6, Doc. No. 81-4, ¶7, \nDoc. No. 81-12, ¶11, Doc. No. 81-16, ¶7, Doc. No. 81-21, ¶¶5-6. Plaintiffs point to evidence that \nthe long-range acoustic device (LRAD) typically used to project sound to large crowds was only \ntested one time that night, no specific warning followed, and it stopped working. See e.g. Doc. \nNos. 81-2, ¶26; Doc. No. 275, p. 5. They further assert that while another police vehicle, the \nBearcat, has sound projection, it is not as loud as the LRAD. Doc. No. 275, p. 5 (citing Doc. No. \n239-15, p. 98). On this basis, protestors claimed because they did not see the signs and did not hear \nany warnings from law enforcement they had a right to be on the Bridge protesting on November \n20, 2016.  \n[¶40]  In fact, Plaintiffs Dundon, Wilson, Demo, Dullknife, Bruce, and Finan all maintain they \nwent to and on the Bridge on November 20, 2016 to protest at different times. Plaintiff Wilson \nmaintains she went to the Bridge to peacefully gather with other protestors. Doc. No. 14-16, ¶10. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 18 of 91\nShe maintains she was praying with other protestors on the Bridge for about an hour, and at that \ntime, officers were shooting a water cannon at her and launching tear gas canisters and flash bang \ngrenades at the crowd. Doc. No. 14-16, ¶10. She asserts she left the Bridge for a rest, returning \nwith more clothing. Doc. No. 14-16, ¶11. She maintains when she arrived back to the Bridge, she \nheld a piece of plastic up to shield other protestors from the water, while a tarp covered her and \nother protestors from the water. Doc. No. 14-16, ¶12. She states she next heard a bang and felt an \nimpact on her chest. Doc. No. 14-16, ¶12. She grabbed a piece of aluminum sheet to protect herself \nand others, walking back away from the police line. Doc. No. 14-16, ¶12. Wilson next went to the \nmedic tent where she changed clothes, put on an ice pack, and laid down. Doc. No. 14-16, ¶13. \nShe maintains she returned to the protest, including the Bridge, to deliver blankets to individuals \nto keep warm, and while she was doing so, police were spraying individuals with water. Doc. No. \n14-16, ¶13. She contends she “did not hear any dispersal at all the entire night [she] was on the \nBridge on November 20, before or after [she] was shot, gassed, or soaked by the hoses.” Doc. No. \n14-16, ¶14.  \n[¶41]  Plaintiff Dundon contends she arrived at the Bridge on November 20, 2016 at around \n7:00 or 8:00 p.m. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶4. She was one of the first people to arrive at the Bridge, and \nwhen she arrived, she witnessed other protestors removing one of the burned-out trucks from the \nBridge. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶5. She states the “Army Corps had promised to remove the vehicles that \nhad been placed there by law enforcement, but they never did so people in camp mobilized to \nremove the vehicles.” Doc. No. 14-19, ¶5. She maintains that after the first truck was removed, \nshe saw a woman alone on the frontlines. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶6. She told the woman to move, and at \nthat point, she asserts she and the woman were the closest people to the line of law enforcement \nofficers. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶6. Dundon asserts that as the woman moved to the side of the road, she \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 19 of 91\nheard a tear gas cannon go off. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶7. She saw the tear gas canister coming straight \nfor her face. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶7. Her experience with canisters was that they usually were shot in \nthe air. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶7. She maintains she did not have time to move, so when she saw the tear \ngas canister was aflame and a foot from her face, she closed her eyes and was struck in the right \neye by the canister. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶8. She fell to the ground, and when she turned to run away, \nshe was shot in the back of the leg with a rubber bullet. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶9. She asserts the bullet \ncaused her to fall down, and after she called for help, she was picked up by other protestors. Doc. \nNo. 14-19, ¶10. She contends protestors were “all over the Bridge” at this point. Doc. No. 239-1, \np. 192.  She was transported first to the camp and then ultimately to the Emergency Room at \nSanford Hospital in Bismarck, North Dakota. Doc. No. 14-19, ¶11.  \n[¶42]  Dundon concedes she was present and personally observed and heard law enforcement \nusing less-lethal munitions against protestors who were illegally trying to remove the burned-out \ntruck. Doc. No. 239-1, p. 313.  Dundon contends there was a lot of noise on the Bridge while she \nwas there, including from the sound of efforts made by protestors to remove the burned-out truck \nand from law enforcement, although she maintains she never “heard them say really get off the \nBridge.” Doc. No. 239-1, p. 158. She asserts that even if officers had given orders, she would not \nhave heard them at all. Doc. No. 239-1, p. 158. She contends that protestors were wearing ear \nplugs, as they “all have earplugs.” Doc. No. 239-1, p. 307.  \n[¶43]  Plaintiff Dullknife contends he came to the protest camps in mid-July of 2016. Doc. No. \n14-13, ¶4. He asserts that upon arriving at the camps, he saw “how the violence and attacks from \nthe police and security forces have gotten worse and worse.” Doc. No. 14-13, ¶5. Dullknife states \nthat he arrived at the Bridge around 10 or 11 p.m. on November 20, 2016. Doc. No. 14-13, ¶8. \nDullknife maintains he witnessed one woman being shot with the water cannon after one officer \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 20 of 91\ntold another to spray her, even though she was kneeling and praying about 12-13 feet from the \nbarbed wire barricade. Doc. No. 14-13, ¶8. Dullknife states he and another person put a board in \nfront of the woman to allow her to keep praying, but the visibility was low because of “a fire on \nthe bank of the Cannonball River that was warming people who were part of the prayer assembly.” \nDoc. No. 14-13, ¶8. He asserts officers were shooting bean bags and other projectiles in the smoke, \nand he was hit in the chest, stomach, and side with beanbag rounds. Doc. No. 14-13, ¶8. Dullknife \ncontends he observed officers haul in three trucks full of water for the water cannon, he observed \nlaw enforcement use beanbags, rubber bullets, tear gas, flash bang or concussion grenades, and he \nheard police officers laughing and celebrating after protestors were hit. Doc. No. 14-13, ¶10.  He \nasserts he did not hear law enforcement officers give warnings before shooting people, as “there \nwas a lot of commotion going on,” “it was cold,” and he was wet. Doc. No. 239-7, p. 105.  \n[¶44]  Plaintiff Demo states he came to the protestor camps in mid-August of 2016. Doc. No. \n14-17, ¶3. Demo contends he went to the Bridge on November 20, 2016 at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. Doc. \nNo. 14-17, ¶3. Demo states he was in Bismarck prior to going to the Bridge when he learned \nthrough online livestream that law enforcement “were being aggressive, using water cannons and \nriot weapons against peaceful water protectors.” Doc. No. 14-17, ¶7. Once he arrived at the Bridge, \nhe maintains he was filming the events with a go pro camera. Within five minutes, he was hit with \nwater from a water hose for thirty seconds. Doc. No. 14-17, ¶7. He maintains he was not \nthreatening the officers in anyway. Doc. No. 14-17, ¶7. He states, “there was no warning that I \nwould be soaked, no warning to get off the Bridge, and no warning that projectiles would be fired \nagainst me.” Doc. No. 14-17, ¶7. After being sprayed with water, he claims he was hit with what \nlooked like a rubber bullet in his right hand. Doc. No. 14-17, ¶7. He went back behind the Bridge \nto get first aid treatment after being shot with a rubber bullet. Doc. No. 14-17, ¶8. He then went \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 21 of 91\nback to the Bridge to give his brother his camera, he drove back to Sacred Stone camp to put on \ndry clothes, returned to the Bridge. Doc. No. 14-17, ¶8. He stayed there until 5 a.m. Doc. No. 14-\n17, ¶8. Demo maintains he never heard an order to disperse while he was on the Bridge. Doc. No. \n14-17, ¶9. He only heard officers tell protestors to get back from the barbed wire, which he did \nwhen requested. Doc. No. 14-17, ¶10.    \n[¶45]  Plaintiff Bruce contends she came to the protestors’ camp in mid-October of 2016. Doc. \nNo. 14-9, ¶2. She went to the Backwater Bridge around 6:30 p.m. on November 20, 2016. Doc. \nNo. 14-9, ¶6. She asserts she saw law enforcement lined up across the Bridge behind the barb wire \nfence. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶¶7-8. When she moved to the front to pray, she was sprayed with water \ncannons by law enforcement. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶8. According to Plaintiff Bruce, this continued the \nentire time she was at the protest. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶¶9-10. She could not see without taking off her \ngoggles because of the flood lights. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶12. She avers she had a hard time breathing \nbecause of the tear gas that was being released, which hurt her lungs and burned her nose. Doc. \nNo. 14-9, ¶13. She claims a flashbang thrown by an officer hit her in the pelvic area when she bent \nover to grab a plastic container. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶14. She believes this was because she was at the \nfront and did not move for a long period of time. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶15. She did not immediately feel \npain from the flash bang, so she remained in the front for another 20-30 minutes, at which time \nshe went to see a medic. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶17. While receiving treatment, she began to feel pain in \nher pelvis and abdomen, and she was transported by ambulance to Sanford Hospital in Bismarck, \nNorth Dakota. Doc. No. 14-9, ¶20.  \n[¶46]  Plaintiff Finan avers he came to the protestors’ camp in early November of 2016 to \ndocument the events unfolding. Doc. No. 14-15, ¶2. He went to the Bridge on November 20, 2016. \nDoc. No. 14-15, ¶4. He notes there were law enforcement officers and “lots of military vehicles” \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 22 of 91\non the other side of the Bridge. Doc. No. 14-15, ¶6. He maintains he saw protestors being sprayed \nwith water. Doc. No. 14-15, ¶6. However, he claims the two small campfires he saw burning in \nthe area were “well-controlled.” Doc. No. 14-15, ¶7. He saw protestors being removed from the \nBridge by medics, smoke canisters being thrown by law enforcement, and he heard what sounded \nlike gunshots. Doc. No. 14-15, ¶¶8-9. While standing on the Bridge, he was sprayed with a cloud \nof something that burned his eyes and made him cough, causing him to go back to the camp. Doc. \nNo. 14-15, ¶11. He then grabbed his camera and went back to the Bridge. Doc. No. 14-15, ¶12. \nOnce back at the Bridge, he started taking photos when he was shot in the waistline by a law \nenforcement officer with what he assumed to be a rubber bullet. Doc. No. 14-15, ¶14. Other \nprotestors helped him up and into a pickup truck. Doc. No. 14-15, ¶15.  \n[¶47]  In addition to the six-named Plaintiffs, several other protestors filed declarations in this \ncase  explaining  their  experiences  on  November  20,  2016.  The  Court  will  not  discuss  all \ndeclarations but will highlight a few to give more context to the events of November 20, 2016 \nfrom the protestors’ points of view. The declaration of Martyn Lenoble provides a detailed account \nfrom his perspective of the November 20, 2016, incident, with photographs. See Docket No. 81-\n27. Lenoble alleges he was preparing to leave Oceti Sakowin Camp on November 20, 2016, when \nhe noticed shortly after 5:00 p.m. a semi-truck attempt to tow a burned-out truck away from the \npolice barricade. Doc. No. 81-27, ¶4. He states:  \nI did not hear any warning that the police would use rubber bullets, gas, or any other \nriot weapons. I heard the police on the bullhorn address one of the guys on the \nBridge by name. “Don’t do this Mike. We have 10 more of these trucks, and \ntomorrow we’ll just bring another one in. Go home!” Without warning from the \npolice, I saw the police fired their first tear gas onto the Bridge, and right beside the \nBridge, which started the first fire in the brush.  \n \nAt approximately 5:30 PM, the semi managed to pull the burnt out truck on the left \naway from the rest of the barricade. By 5:45 PM, the semi managed to pull the truck \nthat was part of the left side of the barricade all the way across the Bridge and off \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 23 of 91\nto the side of the road. This is when more water protectors showed up. At first, a \nslow trickle, by 6:15 PM a steady parade, growing in numbers by the minute. \n \nDoc. No. 81-27, ¶¶10-18.  \n[¶48]  Lenoble further notes: “The water protectors were gathered in prayer, ceremony, and \nprotest on the Bridge, and there was only one way to get out—back to the south. Without warning, \nthe police launched tear gas all the way at the end of the Bridge, such that there was no escape,’ \nalthough he does not state he was one of those people. Doc. No. 81-27, ¶25. Lenoble said he never \nsaw anyone threaten or attack the police, although he acknowledged the protesters did not leave \nthe Bridge. See Doc. No. 81-27.   \n[¶49]  Phillip Weeks was a “legal observer” in the vicinity of the Backwater Bridge for six hours \non the night of November 20, 2016. See Doc. No. 81-23.  He notes that at approximately 6:22 \np.m., he heard law enforcement make a warning, although it was difficult to make out, but it \nwarned protestors “to move south from their current position.” Doc. No. 81-23, ¶7. A few minutes \nlater, he saw law enforcement fire a canister into the crowd of protestors. Doc. No. 81-23, ¶7. He \ndoes not recall hearing another warning by law enforcement. Doc. No. 81-23, ¶12. He only saw a \ntotal of maybe four water bottles and one spent smoke canister thrown from the protestor side to \nthe law enforcement side. Doc. No. 81-23, ¶15. As for the water cannon, he states:  \nThe water cannons were used throughout the night, either taking direct aim at \nprotesters or arched high in the air. Thus many of the protesters who were far back \nfrom the “front line” were sprayed with water. At one point in the night, water \nprotectors held up a tarp for the sole purpose of keeping the prayer assembly from \nbeing doused by the water from the cannons as they sung their prayers. . . . The use \nof the water cannons, pepper spray, and munitions by law enforcement appeared \nlargely indiscriminate.  \n \nSee Doc. No. 81-23, ¶¶17-18. \n[¶50]  Gabriela Lopez also acted as a “legal observer” of the November 20, 2016, incident on \nBackwater Bridge.  See Doc. No. 81-28.  While she was on the Bridge or near it, she witnessed \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 24 of 91\nmany protestors injured or cold from the water. Doc. No. 81-28, ¶7. For the three to four hours she \nwas there, she only observed law enforcement take a few minute break from using the water \ncannon on protestors. Doc. No. 81-28, ¶7. She also saw law enforcement using tear gas, with what \nshe suspected was law enforcement throwing twenty canisters at protestors in a thirty second span. \nDoc. No. 81-28, ¶8. She notes that some were thrown close to the barricade, and other were thrown \nfar to the south of the Bridge, making it difficult to escape the gas. Doc. No. 81-28, ¶8. She did \nwitness a few protestors throw the gas canisters that had been launched by law enforcement back \nat them. Doc. No. 81-28, ¶12. She further notes:  \nAt no point during the 3-4 hours I was observing, did I hear the police provide a \nwarning to the water protectors on or around the Bridge that the police would be \nusing tear gas, water canisters, flash bang grenades, or projectiles like rubber bullets \nor riot shotguns. I also do not recall ever hearing the police ordering or asking water \nprotectors to get off the Bridge, the embankments or to back away. I do not recall \nany direction from the police as to how to avoid the use of their riot weapons.  \n \nDoc. No. 81-28, ¶10.  \n \n[¶51]  Dr. Niheu, a physician from Hawaii, was present and treating protestors during the \nNovember 20, 2016, protest. Doc. No. 271. Dr. Niheu attests over 300 protestors were seen for \ninjuries. Doc. No. 271, ¶6. Of those 300 protestors, 26 were seriously injured and required \nambulance transportation to nearby hospitals. Doc. No. 271, ¶6. Dr. Niheu attests these serious \ninjuries include a woman who nearly lost her arm, a man who had a grand mal seizure, a woman \nshot in the eye, an elder who lost consciousness and was revived at the scene, a man with internal \nbleeding, a man shot in the back with les-lethal munitions near his spine, and multiple fractures. \nDoc. No. 271, ¶12.  \nc.  Defendants’ version of events  \n[¶52]  On October 27, 2016, law enforcement asserts their efforts to remove the blockades and \nprotesters from private property located north of the Backwater Bridge was met with violence.  See \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 25 of 91\nDoc. Nos. 52, pp. 3-5; 53, p. 3-6; 54, pp. 4-6; 55, pp. 6-9.  Protesters threw rocks, logs, bottles, \nfeces, and other debris at officers and one woman pulled a weapon and fired three rounds near the \npolice line. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 3; 53, pp. 4-5; 54, p. 4; 55, pp. 7-8; 61-5.  Some of the protesters \nwore ear plugs, goggles or gas masks and wore bandanas over their face to conceal their identities. \nSee Doc. Nos. 52, p. 4; 53, pp. 2-3; 54, p. 4; 55, p. 6.  Protesters burned heavy construction \nequipment used on the DAPL project, set fire to a vehicle on Highway 1806 near the North Camp, \nset fire on a Bridge on County Road 134, tried to set a vehicle on fire under an electrical \ntransmission tower located along Highway 1806, and set a vehicle and an electronic highway sign \non fire near the north end of the Bridge. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 4-5; 53, pp. 3, 5-6; 54, pp. 4-6; 55, \np. 7-9.   \n[¶53]  As the police line proceeded south toward the Backwater Bridge, protesters threw \nMolotov cocktails (homemade explosives) at law enforcement. See Doc. Nos. 53, p. 6; 54, p. 6; \n55, p. 9.  Protesters secured themselves to buried anchors located in structures and to vehicles \nlocated on Highway 1806 with devices called sleeping dragons. See Doc. Nos. 53, p. 4; 54, p. 5.  \nAnother protester attempted to secure himself with a sleeping dragon to the Mine Resistant \nAmbush Protected (“MRAP”) vehicle utilized by law enforcement officials on Highway 1806 in \nan attempt to immobilize it. See Doc. No. 54, p. 5.  Protesters on horseback intentionally stampeded \nseveral hundred bison toward law enforcement officers and other protesters – twice, which were \ndiverted by the intervention of a nearby helicopter which moved the bison away from people. See \nDoc. Nos. 52, p. 4; 53, p. 5; 54, p. 5; 55, pp. 7-8.  Protesters also attempted to flank the police line. \nSee Doc. Nos. 52, p. 4; 53, p. 5; 55, p. 7.  \n[¶54]  Officers contend protestors resisted law enforcement’s commands, and it frequently took \nthree or four law enforcement officers to restrain and cuff a single protester. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 26 of 91\n4; 53, p. 4; 54, p. 5; 55, p. 7.  Law enforcement officers reported seeing numerous weapons on the \nprotesters during this incident, including a firearm, hunting knives, hatchets, large logs, large \nrocks, and other weapons. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 4; 53, p. 4-5; 54, pp. 4-5; 55, p. 4-9.  One or more \nprotesters drove a vehicle beneath an electric powerline tower located a short distance to the east \nof, and near the intersection of County Road 134 and Highway 1806, placed a rag in its gas tank, \nand tried to set it on fire. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 5; 53, p. 6.  \n[¶55]  After law enforcement officials moved protesters south of the Backwater Bridge, they \nplaced and disabled two large military surplus dump trucks across the north side of the Bridge as \na barricade. See Doc. Nos. 53, p. 6; 54, p. 6; 55, pp. 8-9. Within roughly 10-15 minutes of these \nvehicles being placed on the Bridge, protesters set both vehicles on fire. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 5; \n53, p. 6; 54, p. 6; 55, pp. 8-9. Protesters also set a third vehicle and a North Dakota Department of \nTransportation (“DOT”) electronic sign on fire near the north end of the Bridge. See Doc. Nos. 52, \np. 5; 53, p. 6; 54, p. 6. Protesters gathered on the Bridge and refused commands to leave. See Doc. \nNo. 54, p. 6. Law enforcement officers arrested 141 protesters on October 27, 2016—a majority \nfor conspiracy to endanger by fire, explosion, engaging in a riot and maintaining a public nuisance.  \nSee Doc. No. 54, p. 6.   \n[¶56]  Due to the events of this previous protest, namely the fires that consumed the two-burned \nout trucks and caused the DOT to close the Bridge, the Defendants believed the Bridge was closed \nto pedestrians during the November 20, 2016 protest. For example, the City of Mandan believed \nthe Bridge was closed and the protestors who were present upon it were trespassing. See Doc. No. \n239, p. 200 (“From my knowledge and the City of Mandan’s knowledge is the entire Bridge was \na “No Trespass” because of the potential danger of structural integrity because of the burning \ntrucks that were on there.”). Sheriff Kaiser also believed the Bridge to be closed to pedestrians. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 27 of 91\nSee Doc. No. 239-14, p. 42, 63, Kaiser Deposition, (“For me, closed is closed, so either - - either \nway.”). Sheriff Kirchmeier believed the Bridge to be closed to pedestrians, stating it was his \nunderstanding the DOT put the no trespassing signs up and given not only the signs but other \ncircumstances, protestors would know the Bridge was closed. Doc. No. 266-6, p. 112; see also \nDoc. No. 266-6, p. 108 (“Because of the signs and all the other activities. They were told hundreds \nof times to get off the Bridge. How many times do you have to be told that the Bridge was closed \nbefore they can understand that?”). Individual officers responding to the November 20, 2016 \nprotest also provided testimony they understood the Bridge was closed, further attesting warnings \nwere given to protestors to stay off the Bridge as early as when the burned-out truck was being \nremoved. See Doc. No. 52, ¶¶44, 52, 60; Doc. No. 53, ¶¶27, 42; Doc. No. 54, ¶¶30, 40, 42, 43, 47, \n73, 76, 77, 81, 82; Doc. No. 284-1, pp. 2 – 22.  \n[¶57]  With this knowledge, the November 20, 2016, incident started in the afternoon when, \nagainst the repeated warnings and commands of law enforcement officers located on the north side \nof the barricade, protesters used a large bolt cutter and a semi-truck to cut the chain securing the \nburned-out dump truck located in the west lane, and drug it away from the law enforcements’ \nbarricade. See Doc. No. 54, pp. 7-9. The protesters then returned to remove the remaining burned-\nout dump truck, which was secured to, and a part of, the law enforcements’ barricade. See Doc. \nNo. 54, pp. 7-9. The affidavits submitted by the Defendants reveal the number of protesters on the \nBackwater Bridge swelled at this point to several hundred. See Doc. No. 54, p. 9.  The Defendants \ncontend the protesters appeared to be prepared for an assault on the roughly 20 law enforcement \nofficers manning the barricade at that time. See Doc. No. 54, pp. 7-9.   \n[¶58]  Defendants assert the protesters organized themselves into two principal bodies – a \nforward staged siege group wearing rain coats, goggles, and bandanas over their faces, and bearing \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 28 of 91\nassorted shields made of plywood, plastic, and corrugated tin/steel, along with tarps, and a larger \ngroup which remained further back south on the Backwater Bridge. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 10-11, \n15-16; 53, p. 6-10; 54, pp. 9, 11, 15.  The forward group utilized their shields and tarps to form a \nmobile barricade to shield themselves and other protesters from law enforcements’ view and from \nany force which may be applied by law enforcement. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 15; 53, p. 10; 54, pp. \n11-12.  The protesters moved this mobile barricade up against the barricade to shield other \nprotesters who were attempting to cut the chains on the remaining burned out dump truck, and \nprotesters cutting the concertina wire in the law enforcement’s barricade. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp.  \n10-11, 15-16; 53, p. 7-9; 54, p. 11-12, 14-17.  Law enforcement officers gave repeated warnings \nover a Long Range Acoustic Device (“LRAD”) that protesters were trespassing and that protesters \nshould disengage and return to the south side of the Bridge. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 13-15; 53, pp. \n7, 10; 54, pp. 8-10, 15-17; Doc. No. 239-15, p. 151.  \n[¶59]  Protesters were yelling profanities and throwing and slinging large rocks, lug nuts, \nconstruction nuts, padlocks, frozen water bottles, and other objects at law enforcement officers. \nSee Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 11-12, 14-16;53, pp. 7, 11; 54, pp. 9-10, 12-13, 17; 61-3, pp. 46-55 \n(photographs of items recovered following the protest).  The record reveals law enforcement \nofficers feared for their physical safety due to the imminent threats of serious bodily injury or death \nthey were encountering.  See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 11-12; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 11, 13-14, 16-17.  \n[¶60]  Law enforcement officers deployed hand-tossed CS gas canisters to drive protesters away \nfrom the barricade, but due to the wind blowing to the northwest, the gas crossed over the police \nline, and its use was discontinued. See Doc. Nos. 53, p. 9; 54, p. 11.  Protesters also threw the CS \ngas canisters back at law enforcement. See Doc. Nos. 53, p. 9; 54, p. 12.  Officers attempted to \nstop the forward siege group and protesters from throwing objects through the use of OC spray \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 29 of 91\nand direct impact sponge and bean bag rounds, again to a limited effect due to the protesters’ \nmobile barricade and law enforcements’ barricade. See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 14; 53, pp. 8-10, 12; 54, \npp. 9-11, 13-14.  Police shields were requested for the first time during the ongoing DAPL protests \ndue to the constant barrage of objects being thrown at law enforcement. See Doc. No. 54, p. 11.  \nNot all officers had helmets as the quarter master had run out. See Doc. No. 54, p. 12.  A second \n“Code Red” was issued requesting all available law enforcement officers within  a 100-mile radius \nto respond and assist. See Doc. No. 54, p. 12.   \n[¶61]  Protesters crossed the Bridge and took up positions along the east and west flanks of the \npolice line, starting several large bonfires along the east flank and along the north shore of the \nCantapeta Creek and on the Bridge. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 53, pp. 6-7; 54, pp. 12-13.  One \nof the bonfires was built within approximately 30 feet of law enforcements’ barricade and \nprotectors in that vicinity began throwing burning logs at the police line. See Doc. No. 54, p. 13.  \nA brush truck from the Mandan Rural Fire Department was requested to address the fires. See \nDoc. Nos. 52, pp. 13-14; 54, p. 14-16; 56, pp. 1-2. \n[¶62]  As reinforcement officers started to arrive, and when there were approximately 70 \nofficers on the scene to deal with approximately 800 – 1,000 protesters on or north of the Bridge, \nthe officers formed a shield line along the barricade. See Doc. No. 54, p. 12.  The protesters threw \nshields across the concertina wire, and one protester climbed over law enforcements’ barricade. \nSee Doc.  Nos. 53, p. 10; 54, p. 15.  This individual was the only person arrested during the event—\nlaw enforcement was fully occupied in holding the line. See Doc. No. 54, p. 15.   \n[¶63]  While the siege group was working on cutting the concertina wire and the chains securing \nthe truck to the barricade, and while other protesters continued to throw objects at law enforcement \nofficers, a group of approximately 150 protesters gathered in the west ditch north of the Bridge \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 30 of 91\nand proceeded west and north in an attempt to flank the police line. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; \n53, pp. 11-12; 54, p. 12.  A small group of roughly 20 officers proceeded west to intercept this \ngroup.  See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 54, p. 12.     \n[¶64]  During this time period, law enforcement officers on the scene were also being marked \nby lasers and spotlights by individuals on high ground. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 53, p. 11; 54, \np. 12.  The record reveals there was concern about being targeted by snipers, consistent with \npreviously known social media threats and intelligence regarding weapons in the possession of \nprotesters. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 12-13; 53, p. 11; 54, p. 12.  Law enforcement officers were also \nconcerned  about  being  overrun  by  the  aggressive  and  violent  protesters,  and  the  possible \nconsequences of that eventuality.  See Doc. Nos. 52, p. 12; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 13-14; 56, pp. 3-4; \n57, pp. 4-5.  In addition to being concerned about the obvious risks to the physical safety of law \nenforcement officers if the scene was overrun, there was genuine concern about the potential to \nresort to deadly force for the protection of law enforcement and emergency responders on site, as \nwell as the concern about the potential loss of armored vehicles, weapons, and munitions which \ncould later be used by the protesters against law enforcement and others. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 12, \n14-16; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 13-14.  At that time, a “Signal-100” was issued, requesting the assistance \nof all available law enforcement, state-wide. See Doc. No. 54, p. 14.   \n[¶65]  With fire apparatus on the scene, and the methods being utilized by law enforcement \nproving ineffective against the protesters, permission was requested, and received from command, \nto utilize water to extinguish fires and hold the police line. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 13-15; 53, pp. 8-\n9; 54, p. 14.  Following repeated warning by law enforcement, both in relation to the ongoing \ntrespass and commands to proceed south of the Bridge, and in relation to the intended application \nof water, water was ultimately deployed against protesters attempting to dismantle and penetrate \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 31 of 91\nthe law enforcement barricade, and those throwing objects at law enforcement officers. See Doc. \nNos. 54, pp. 14-15; 56, pp. 2-3; 57, pp. 2-5.  The Defendants contend no “water cannon” was \ninvolved. See Doc. Nos. 54, p. 15; 56, p. 3; 57, p. 4.  The Defendants assert water was crucial to \nlaw enforcements’ ability to prevent the penetration of law enforcements’ barricade and prevent \nserious bodily injury or death to law enforcement and emergency responders on the scene as a \nresult of the immediate threats presented by the protesters. See Doc. No. 54, p. 16.   \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n[¶66]  The Court will grant summary judgment “if the movant shows . . . there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). “An issue is ‘genuine’ \nif the evidence is sufficient to persuade a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty.” Schilf v. Eli Lilly & Co., 687 F.3d 947, 948 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). “A fact is material if it ‘might affect the outcome of the \nsuit.’” Dick v. Dickinson State Univ., 826 F.3d 1054, 1061 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Anderson, 477 \nU.S. at 248). Courts must afford “the nonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences \nwhich may be drawn without resorting to speculation.”  TCF Nat’l Bank v. Mkt. Intelligence, Inc., \n812 F.3d 701, 707 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Johnson v. Securitas Sec. Servs. USA, Inc., 769 F.3d \n605, 611 (8th Cir. 2014)). “At summary judgment, the court’s function is not to weigh the evidence \nand determine the truth of the matter itself, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.”  Nunn v. Noodles & Co., 674 F.3d 910, 914 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at \n249). “Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate \ninferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.” Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProds., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).   \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 32 of 91\n[¶67]  The basic inquiry for purposes of summary judgment is whether the evidence presents a \nsufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party \nmust prevail as a matter of law. Diesel Machinery, Inc. v. B.R. Lee Indus., Inc., 418 F.3d 820, 832 \n(8th Cir. 2005). “A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence could cause a reasonable jury to return \na verdict for either party.” Moore v. Philander Smith Coll., 25 F. Supp. 3d 1095, 1099 (E.D. Ark. \n2014).  If  the  movant  demonstrates  the  absence  of  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact,  “[t]he \nnonmovant ‘must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the \nmaterial facts,’ and must come forward with ‘specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue \nfor trial.’” Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1042 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (quoting \nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986)). “Where the \nrecord taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there \nis no genuine issue for trial.” Id.  \n[¶68]  The facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the non-movants. Krosch \nv. JLG Indus., Inc., 590 F. Supp.2d 1169, 1173 (D.N.D. 2008).  “At the summary judgment stage, \nfacts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a ‘genuine’ \ndispute as to those facts.” Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 370, 380. (2007) “When opposing parties tell \ntwo different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable \njury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a \nmotion for summary judgment.” Id.  \nIV.  LEGAL DISCUSSION \nFederal Claims \n[¶69]  The Court must begin its overarching discussion of the Plaintiffs’ federal claims with a \ndiscussion of qualified immunity, as the Defendants assert their actions were protected by this \ndoctrine. “Qualified immunity shields government officials from liability unless their conduct \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 33 of 91\nviolates clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would \nknow.” Ferguson v. Short, 840 F.3d 508, 510 (8th Cir. 2016). “The determination of whether \nqualified immunity is applicable in given circumstances is one of ‘objective reasonableness.’”  \nHerts v. Smith, 345 F.3d 581, 585 (8th Cir. 2003). The issue is not “whether the defendant acted \nwrongly, but whether reasonable persons would know they acted in a manner which deprived \nanother of a known constitutional right.” Id. (citing Sparr v. Ward, 306 F.3d 589, 593 (8th Cir. \n2002)).  \n[¶70]  A two-step inquiry is undertaken to determine if qualified immunity is invoked: “(1) \n[whether] the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, demonstrate the deprivation \nof a constitutional or statutory right; and (2) [whether] the right was clearly established at the time \nof the deprivation.” Jones v. McNeese, 675 F.3d 1158, 1161 (8th Cir. 2012). The defendants bear \nthe burden of proof on this affirmative defense. Id. However, to defeat an asserted qualified \nimmunity defense, the plaintiffs have the burden to show that their asserted right was clearly \nestablished at the time of the alleged violation. Quraishi v. St. Charles Cty., Missouri, 986 F.3d \n831, 835 (8th Cir. 2021). The Court will examine each constitutional claim in this context, \nbeginning with whether the deprivation of a constitutional claim was demonstrated.  \na.  EXCESSIVE FORCE  \n[¶71]  The Court will begin its analysis of whether the facts, viewed in the light most favorable \nto the Plaintiffs, demonstrate the deprivation of the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to be free from \nexcessive force. Typically, an excessive force claim will proceed under the Fourth Amendment \nanalysis. However, in limited instances, it may proceed under the Fourteenth Amendment. The \nclaim may only proceed under the Fourth or the Fourteenth Amendment, not both.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 34 of 91\n[¶72]  “In addressing an excessive force claim brought under § 1983, analysis begins by \nidentifying the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed by the challenged application of \nforce.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989). “In most instances, that will be either the \nFourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable seizures of the person, or the Eighth \nAmendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishments, which are the two primary sources of \nconstitutional protection against physically abusive governmental conduct.” Id. However, the \nSupreme Court has noted not “all constitutional claims relating to physically abusive government \nconduct must arise under either the Fourth or Eighth Amendments.” United States v. Lanier, 520 \nU.S. 259, 272 (1997). “Rather, if a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional \nprovision, such as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the claim must be analyzed under the standard \nappropriate to that specific provision, not under the rubric of substantive due process.”  Id. \n(modified). If a claim does not fit neatly within the Fourth or Eighth Amendments, it is then that a \nplaintiff may turn to the Fourteenth Amendment. See Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, \n844-45 (1998) (“Graham ‘preserve[s] fourteenth amendment substantive due process analysis for \nthose instances in which a free citizen is denied his or her constitutional right . . .  through means \nother than a law enforcement official’s arrest, investigatory stop or other seizure.’”); see also id. \nat 844 (quoting Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1036 (1st Cir. 1996) (“[O]utside the context of a \nseizure . . . a person injured as a result of police misconduct may prosecute a substantive due \nprocess claim under section 1983”)). The Court will begin by determining if the Plaintiffs’ \nexcessive force claim fits neatly in the Fourth Amendment.  \n \n \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 35 of 91\na.  Fourth Amendment  \ni.  Seizure \n \n[¶73]  “An excessive force claim is governed by the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against \nunreasonable seizures.” Thompson v. Dill, 930 F.3d 1008, 1013 (8th Cir. 2019). To establish a \nFourth Amendment violation for unreasonable seizure, a plaintiff “must demonstrate both that [the \nstate actor] seized her within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and that the seizure was \nunreasonable.” Thomas v. Barze, 57 F. Supp. 3d 1040, 1068 (D. Minn. 2014) (citing Andrews v. \nFuoss, 417 F.3d 813, 816 (8th Cir. 2005)). “A Fourth Amendment seizure occurs when there is \n‘meaningful interference, however brief, with an individual’s freedom of movement.’” United \nStates v. Dolson, 673 F. Supp. 2d 842, 864–65 (D. Minn. 2009). “A person has been ‘seized’ within \nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the \nincident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.” United States v. \nDortch, 868 F.3d 674, 677 (8th Cir. 2017). A seizure can occur through law enforcement’s show \nof authority or in certain circumstances through law enforcement’s use of physical force. See \nOglesby v. Lesan, 929 F.3d 526, 532 (8th Cir. 2019) (“Only when the officer, by means of physical \nforce or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may [a court] \nconclude that a ‘seizure’ has occurred.”) (emphasis added). The Eighth Circuit further outlined the \nparameters of when physical force may constitute a seizure:  \nTo constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure, an application of physical force must \nbe willful because the word seizure can hardly be applied to an unknowing act. \nWhether physical force was intentionally applied, is determined by the officer's \nobjective behavior, not his subjective motive. Also implicit in the term seizure is a \nrequirement that the application of physical force restrain freedom of movement. \nThis restraint need not actually succeed in stopping or holding the person even for \nan instant. But the seizure does not outlast the restraint on free movement.  \n \nAtkinson v. City of Mountain View, Mo., 709 F.3d 1201, 1208 (8th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted) \n(alterations to original).  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 36 of 91\n \n[¶74]  Defendants argue the Plaintiffs were not seized in this matter. Defendants assert the \nPlaintiffs were not arrested or detained at any point by law enforcement on November 20, 2016, \nnor were they advised by law enforcement they were not free to walk away from the confrontation \nbetween law enforcement and protestors. They further assert their intention in using less-lethal \nforce was to cause the protestors to disperse and move away from law enforcement, not to arrest \nthem or detain them. Defendants maintain:  \nPlaintiffs admit they freely walked south off the Bridge, sometimes to change into \nwarmer  clothes  or  otherwise  warmup  before  returning  to  the  barricade  and \nvoluntarily and intentionally walking within range of the force allegedly being \napplied by Law Enforcement. Plaintiffs’ pleading establishes they were at all times \nable to remove themselves from the presence of Law Enforcement and from all \nforce  applied by simply voluntarily disengaging  from  Law Enforcement, and \nproceeding south across the Bridge from where they came-which they did.  \n \n. . .  \n \nA citizen has no liberty interest to infringe upon the property rights of others by \nengaging  in  trespass  or  otherwise  being  present  upon  property  without \nauthorization or privilege. If that were not the case, a seizure would occur each time \nan officer prevents unauthorized access to private property, or to restricted public \nproperty, despite no attempt to apprehend. \n \nDoc. No. 136, pp. 36, 37.  \n \n[¶75]  Plaintiffs respond the Defendants have misstated the proper analysis for determining \nwhether an individual was seized. The Plaintiffs assert the Defendants interpretation “conflates \nshow of force and/or show of authority with actual use of force to conclude that regardless of use \nof force, a person subjected to the force would need to believe he or she was not free to leave as a \nresult of the application of force.” Doc. No. 275, p. 44. Plaintiffs further assert, “[t]his seeks to \nimply that a person who is seized temporarily by force, without arrest or continuing restraint on \nliberty, has not been seized if thereafter or otherwise they are free to leave.” Doc. No. 275, p. 44. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs assert it is irrelevant whether the Defendants’ intended to disperse a crowd \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 37 of 91\nor make an arrest, what matters is the Defendants’ terminated the Plaintiffs’ freedom of movement \nwhen they intentionally applied force to them, using less-lethal munitions.  \n[¶76]  The Court is presented with the question of whether the use of force through less-lethal \nmunitions in a large crowd-control context by law enforcement can constitute a seizure under the \nFourth Amendment.  Defendants assert the Eighth Circuit has already addressed this question in \nBernini v. City of St. Paul, 665 F.3d 997 (8th Cir. 2012). In Bernini, thirty-two individuals filed \nsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against six police officers and the City of St. Paul, Minnesota. Bernini, \n665 F.3d at 1000. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants violated their First and Fourth Amendment \nrights during a confrontation that occurred on the first day of the 2008 Republican National \nConvention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Id. Large groups of protestors were present throughout the day, \nwith many groups hosting permit-approved marches. Id. at 1001. Property damage was reported \nthroughout the day as well, with police cars being vandalized, objects thrown at cars and buses, \nand broken windows. Id. After the permit-approved marches ended, a senior commander with the \npolice force closed the downtown area to “reestablish control and reestablish law enforcement \npresence.” Id.  \n[¶77]  The confrontation at issue occurred on Shepard Road, which runs along the edge of \ndowntown St. Paul, borders the Mississippi River, and provides only limited access to downtown. \nId. at 1001. The senior commander learned a group of people were marching on Shepard Road, so \nhe instructed a team of officers to position itself on intersections of Shepard Road and Jackson \nStreet and Shepard Road and Sibley Street and others to prevent entry into downtown. Id. The \nteam had learned the group marching were involved in unlawful acts that had occurred earlier in \nthe day. Id. Approximately eleven officers were stationed at each intersection. Id.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 38 of 91\n[¶78]  The video recordings showed approximately one hundred protestors gathered at the \nintersection of Shepard Road and Jackson Street. Id. at 1001. At one point, a group of about fifteen \nprotestors began to cross Shepard Road and move toward the officers and downtown. Id. Officers \ninstructed the group to back up, and as the group continued to move forward, the officers deployed \nstinger blast balls. Id. The group retreated back to the sidewalk. Id. The court noted “[a]lthough \nthe plaintiffs deny seeing anyone throw objects at Team 36, the officers reported that numerous \nobjects—including rocks and bags containing feces—were propelled at them.” Id. After the group \nretreated to the sidewalk, they began to move west toward Jackson Street. Id. Law enforcement, \nincluding backup, attempted to move the crowd away from Jackson Street and back toward where \nthey came from. Id. The protestor group had swelled to include hundreds of people by this point, \nand law enforcement continued to use non-lethal munitions, including smoke, blast balls, and \nchemical irritants to keep the crowd from moving west. Id. at 1002.  \n[¶79]  The senior commander in consultation with the officer in charge at the scene made the \ndecision to encircle the crowd, which then included over 400 individuals, in a park adjacent to \nShepard Road. Id. at 1002. Once the protestors were contained in the park, law enforcement \nannounced by loudspeaker multiple times that all persons were under arrest and must sit down \nwhile officers attempted to determine who was present at the Shepard-Jackson intersection. Id. \nThe parties disputed whether officers made dispersal orders before encircling them in the park, \nand ultimately, approximately 200 people were arrested. Id. All charges were ultimately dismissed. \nId. The plaintiffs, which included medics, legal observers, protestors, members of the media, \nconcertgoers, and others, filed suit for violations of their First and Fourth Amendment rights. Id.  \n[¶80]  As  to  the  question  of  seizure,  the  plaintiffs  asserted  officers  violated  the  Fourth \nAmendment by “conducting a mass arrest when they had probable cause with respect to only a \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 39 of 91\nsubset of the arrestees.” Id. at 1003. The Eighth Circuit concluded “the officers in this case \nreasonably  could  have  concluded  that  the  group  at  the  Shepard–Jackson  intersection  had \ncommitted a crime and that the group was acting as a unit.” Id. at 1004. The Court noted in finding \nthe seizures lawful: \nVideo footage shows that the group marched east on Shepard Road and then \nstopped at the intersection, positioning itself directly across from the line of Team \n36 officers. Many members of the group had donned gas masks and other facial \ncoverings, as though they were preparing for a confrontation with police. Flags \nwaved from within the crowd, and several people can be heard shouting profanities \nand taunting the officers. A portion of the group, shielding itself behind two large \nsigns, then began to cross the intersection toward the officers. And after the \nconfrontation at the intersection, as the group was driven west on Shepard Road, \nmembers chanted statements in unison. \n \nFrom these actions, a reasonable officer could have concluded that the individuals \nat the intersection were acting together and that they intended to break through the \npolice line in an attempt to access downtown St. Paul. It was reasonable, therefore, \nfor an officer to believe that the group, as a whole, was committing one or more \noffenses under state law, including third degree riot and unlawful assembly.  \n \nId.  \n \n[¶81]  While the facts of Bernini are comparable in some instances, the Court does not find it \ncleanly applies to this case as to the question of seizure. In Bernini, the plaintiffs did not argue the \nuse of less-lethal force itself constituted a seizure. Instead, they were actually temporarily detained \nand argued the detentions were unlawful because only a subset of the protestors had actually \ncommitted a crime. The Eighth Circuit found officers were outnumbered, it would have been \nimpractical for the officers to immediately detain individuals involved in the alleged crimes, and \nbased on the developing situation, it was reasonable for the officers to believe the entire group was \nacting as a “unit” with the goal to breach the police line into downtown. Bernini, 665 F.3d at 1004. \nThe court also noted after moving the protestors to the park, officers attempted to discern who had \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 40 of 91\nbeen part of the unit at the intersection, releasing 200 people thereafter. Bernini, 665 F.3d at 1004. \nIt found this to be a lawful investigative detention. Id.  \n[¶82]  Here, no arrests, aside from one individual who actually breached the barricade, were \nmade. This case centers more on whether a seizure can occur from an indirect physical touch by \nlaw enforcement through less-lethal force in a crowd-control context. For similar reasons, the \nCourt also does not find the Plaintiffs’ citation to and discussion of Atkinson v. City of Mountain \nView, Mo., 709 F.3d 1201 (8th Cir. 2013) applicable to this.  \n[¶83]  In Atkinson, an on-duty, but plain-clothed, police officer, tackled and “bull rushed” \nplaintiff at a high school football game. 709 F.3d at 1205. The plaintiff asserted that when the \ndefendant “barreled into him,” the defendant had effectuated a seizure. Id. at 1207. The defendant \nasserted “a police officer’s use of physical force against an unwilling subject does not always \nimplicate the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizure.” Id.  While the district court \nagreed with the defendant, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the plaintiff, finding the plaintiff had \nbeen seized by the defendant when he applied physical force to him. Id. The Eighth Circuit noted \n“[i]t would make little sense to ask whether a person felt ‘free to leave’ while an officer restrained \nthe person's freedom of movement through physical force because the force itself necessarily—if \nonly briefly— ‘restrained [the person's] liberty.’” Id. at 1209. The Eighth Circuit ultimately found:   \na seizure occurred the moment Sanders charged into Atkinson. It is undisputed \nSanders intentionally applied physical force against Atkinson, and the evidence \nmost favorable to Atkinson shows far more than a slight physical touch—Sanders’ \n“bull rush” forced Atkinson ten to fifteen feet backward into the side of a truck, \nbroke three ribs, punctured one lung, and caused repeated pneumothorax. This \nviolence was more than enough physical force to effect a seizure under the Fourth \nAmendment. \n \nId. at 1209.  \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 41 of 91\n[¶84]  The Court in denying qualified immunity to the officer noted “[o]n August 31, 2007, \nSanders had ‘fair warning’ that charging at a non-resisting individual without first identifying \nhimself as a police officer was unconstitutional in the context of an arrest.” Atkinson, 709 F.3d at \n1212. The Court further noted:  \nAlthough Sanders contends he merely intended to retake his cell phone, not to arrest \nAtkinson, a reasonable jury could find that Sanders “objectively manifested,” an \nintent  to  arrest  Atkinson.  The  reported  fury  of  Sanders’  charge  temporarily \nincapacitated Atkinson, and immediately thereafter Sanders ordered Mountain \nView police officers to take Atkinson into custody. \n \nAtkinson, 709 F.3d at 1212, n.4 (citation omitted).  \n \n[¶85]  The Defendants argue this full reading of Atkinson stands for the proposition that an \nofficer must have an intent to secure government control over the subject. They argue “application \nof physical force, without such an objective manifestation of intent, does not constitute a seizure \nunder the Fourth Amendment.” Doc. No. 143, p. 9. The United States Supreme Court recently \nagreed in the context of apprehending a suspect:  \nWe stress, however, that the application of the common law rule does not transform \nevery physical contact between a government employee and a member of the public \ninto a Fourth Amendment seizure. A seizure requires the use of force with intent to \nrestrain. Accidental force will not qualify. Nor will force intentionally applied for \nsome other purpose satisfy this rule. In this opinion, we consider only force used to \napprehend. We do not accept the dissent’s invitation to opine on matters not \npresented here—pepper spray, flash-bang grenades, lasers, and more. \n \nTorres v. Madrid, 141 S. Ct. 989, 998 (2021).4  \n \n4 The dissent in Torres discusses the use of these types of munitions but in the context of when an \nofficer has an objective intent to detain:   \n \nEven within its field of operation, the majority’s rule seems destined to underdeliver \non its predicted efficiencies. The majority tells us that its new test requires an \n“objective intent to restrain.” But what qualifies is far from clear. The majority \nassures us that a “tap on the shoulder to get one’s attention will rarely exhibit such \nan intent.” Suppose, though, the circumstances ‘objectively’ indicate that the tap \nwas ‘intended’ to secure a person's attention for a minute, a quarter hour, or longer. \nWould that be enough? \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 42 of 91\n[¶86]  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged the defendant in Atkinson had an intent to restrain the \nplaintiff, either by trying to control him in order to regain his cellphone or in order prevent him \nfrom escaping, as officers immediately arrested the plaintiff thereafter. Clearly Atkinson would \nfall in line with Torres’ ruling. Nevertheless, the Court has trouble relying solely on Atkinson, \nwhich involved only one person, in determining whether a group of hundreds, if not over a \nthousand, of individuals facing off with a clearly outnumbered presence of law enforcement in a \nrural, open area were unreasonably seized by officers’ use of less-lethal munitions to disperse, \nrather than detain them. Instead, the Court looks to cases addressing seizures in the crowd-control \ncontext which were handed down prior to November 20, 2016. These cases include Rauen v. City \nof Miami, No. 06-21182-CIV, 2007 WL 686609 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 2, 2007); Jennings v. City of \nMiami, No. 07-23008-CIV, 2009 WL 413110 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2009); Coles v. City of Oakland, \nNo. C-03–2962 THE (N.D. Cal. April 27, 2005; and Nelson v. City of Davis, 685 F.3d 867, 872 \n(9th Cir. 2012).  \n \n \nThen there’s the question what kind of ‘touching’ will suffice. Imagine that, with \nan objective intent to detain a suspect, officers deploy pepper spray that enters a \nsuspect’s lungs as he sprints away. Does the application of the pepper spray count? \nSuppose that, intending to capture a fleeing suspect, officers detonate flash-bang \ngrenades that are so loud they damage the suspect's eardrum, even though he \nmanages to run off. Or imagine an officer shines a laser into a suspect's eyes to get \nhim to stop, but the suspect is able to drive away with now-damaged retinas. Are \nthese  ‘touchings’?  What  about  an  officer's  bullet  that  shatters  the  driver’s \nwindshield, a piece of which cuts her as she speeds away? Maybe the officer didn't \ntouch the suspect, but he set in motion a series of events that yielded a touching. \nDoes that count? While assuring us that its new rule will prove easy to administer, \nthe majority refuses to confront its certain complications. Lower courts and law \nenforcement won't have that luxury.  \n \nTorres, 141 S. Ct. at 1015.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 43 of 91\n[¶87]  These cases all involved confrontations between protestors and law enforcement where \nless-lethal munitions, such as tear gas, rubber bullets, and the like were used by law enforcement \nto get protestors to physical move from their location to another location. What is significant about \neach of the cases, and as recognized in each case, is that protestors essentially had no egress after \nforce was used against them while they were “herded” and encircled by officers into a certain \nlocation. For example, in Jennings, the Court found a seizure when officers marched toward \nprotestors, encircling them and using less-lethal munitions on the protestors to get them to move, \nessentially herding the protestors, into a desired location. 2009 WL 413110, at *9. The Rauen \nCourt noted “It can hardly be disputed that the TAC sufficiently alleges that Plaintiffs’ freedom of \nmovement was terminated by the deliberate use of force and skirmish lines to herd and then \nencircle Plaintiffs in an area in which they otherwise would not have been.” 2007 WL 686609, at \n*8. The Coles Court found “Defendants allegedly did far more than simply order Plaintiffs to \ndisperse from the scene or attempt to control the crowd gathered at the scene of the demonstrations. \nTo the contrary, Defendants allegedly left Plaintiffs with only one available path by which to leave \nthe scene and applied physical force to ensure that Plaintiffs followed that path.” No. C03–2962 \nTHE, at 10. Likewise, in Nelson v. City of Davis, the court found officers had conducted a seizure \nwhen they used less-lethal force against protestors in an attempt to get them to disperse but failed \nto provide them a way to escape, essentially enclosing them in an area. 685 F.3d at 882-83.  \n[¶88]  Taking into account the circumstances of this case and the teachings of these previously \ndiscussed cases, the Court concludes no seizure occurred here. The undisputed facts show law \nenforcement, even at the height of protest on November 20, 2016, remained behind the blockade \non the north side of the Bridge and behind the concertina wire. Law enforcement did not march \ntoward protestors in an attempt to move them in any direction nor did they encircle and herd \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 44 of 91\nPlaintiffs and protestors. Instead, they stood at the line and protestors approached them. The video \nevidence shows protestors pushing toward law enforcement while being subjected to less-lethal \nforce. Aerial footage shows protestors moving on the Bridge, the sides of it, and gathering in \nnumbers south of the Bridge.  \n[¶89]  The Plaintiffs assert this case is “on all fours with Nelson and Alsaada, where officers \ndeployed force without a way for crowd members to get away, as the protestors were subjected to \nforce while moving south, away from the barricade, as well as while near the barricade or standing \nstill.”  The  Court  disagrees.  The  evidence  in  this  case  shows  only  one  conclusion:  officers \nobjectively manifested an intent to move protestors away from the Bridge, get them to disperse, \nand control the crowd. The officers in this case applied less-lethal force not to herd Plaintiffs into \na certain location in such a way that protestors were unable to get away nor did they encircle them \nwithout a way out. Instead, in this case, protestors, including all of the named-Plaintiffs were free \nto leave and disengage law enforcement contact. In fact, almost all of the named-Plaintiffs either \nremained on the Bridge voluntarily or left and returned even after less-lethal force was used against \nthem. There simply was no seizure here.  \n[¶90]  For example, Plaintiff Wilson states “I went to the Bridge immediately north of Oecti \nSakowin camp on Highway 1806 . . . Still police were shooting a high powered water cannon at \nus while I was there, and launching tear gas canisters, and flash bank [sic] grenades. Next I left for \na rest, and returned to the Bridge with more appropriate clothing.”). See Doc. No. 14-16, Wilson \nDeclaration, ¶10 (emphasis added). Demo likewise states:  \nAfter I was hit by the rubber bullet, I went back behind the Bridge to get first aid \ntreatment from the medics. I returned to the Bridge to give my brother Brad Demo \nthe go pro camera and he continued filming. I drove back to Sacred Stone camp to \nput on dry clothes, and I returned to the Bridge to join the protest. I was able to \nkeep myself from getting soaked while on the Bridge by using a board or tarp to \nprotect myself. I stayed there until approximately 5am.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 45 of 91\n \nDoc. No. 14-17, Demo Declaration.  \n[¶91]  Plaintiff Bruce attests even after officers using water on her for a time on the Bridge, she \ncontinued to remain there:   \nOn that day, around 6:30PM (CT), I went to the Bridge immediately north of Oceti \nSakowin camp on Highway 1806 . . . I moved to the front in prayer . . . Throughout \nthe entire time that I was peacefully protesting at the frontline at the Bridge, Police \nofficers were shooting me with the water cannons. I bent down to grab a lid to a \nplastic container to use as a shield and while I was bending over a Police Officer \nshot me with a flash bang. . . I remained in the front for another 20-30 minutes but \nthe tear gas was so over powering that I left the front line to get seen by the medics \nnear the front line.” \n \nDoc. No. 14-9, Bruce Declaration.  \n \n[¶92]  Plaintiff Finan also described being subjected to less-lethal munition and then returning \nto them:  \nOn Sunday, November 20, 2016 in the evening, I went to the Bridge immediately \nnorth of Oceti Sakowin camp on Highway 1806 . . . I was standing on the Bridge \nwith other water protectors when I got sprayed with a cloud of something that \nburned my eyes very badly and made me cough. It was so bad that I had to run \naway and go back to the camp to get away from the gas. I got my camera and then \nwent back to the Bridge because I wanted to document what law enforcement were \ndoing at the Bridge. When I went back to the Bridge, I began taking photos. I was \nholding up my camera and taking photos when I was shot by law enforcement. I \ncould not see how close the officer was who shot me, because there was a bright \nlight coming from the law enforcement, and because I was focused on taking \nphotos.  \n \nDoc. No. 14-15, Finan Declaration.  \n \n[¶93]  Other protestors likewise either stayed on the Bridge voluntarily or left it and returned. \nSee Doc. No. 14-7, Treanor Declaration, ¶5 (“I was standing on the front of the Bridge and I was \npraying for about a half hour but then Police Officers began shooting me with water hoses, rubber \nbullets and pellet guns. I stayed in the same spot for at least (2) hours getting shot by Police Officers \nsporadically but consistently”); Doc. No. 14-8, Hoagland-Lynn Declaration, ¶¶6-7 (“After about \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 46 of 91\nthirty minutes, I walked closer to the front line on the south side of the Bridge and the right side \nof the road looking toward the line of police officers. I was getting sprayed by water cannons as I \nstood there. I left the Bridge to look for my girlfriend and warm my cold hands and then walked \nback to the Bridge by the front lines.”).  \n[¶94]  The  Court  recognizes  that  allegations  were  made  by  some  protestors,  not  named-\nPlaintiffs, that officers were launching tear gas canisters so far south of the Bridge such that \nprotestors were disoriented and could not move right away., i.e. arguing they were not free to leave. \nThe Court also recognizes some protestors allege they were physically injured in such a way that \nthey required assistance to leave. However, based on the totality of the circumstances facing \nofficers and given that the evidence, offered by Plaintiffs themselves, shows protestors, including \nalmost all named-Plaintiffs, moved freely upon and off the Bridge or in the area after force was \nused against them, protestors rushing toward officers in the face of force, and protestors even \nreturning to the area after force was used upon them, the Court finds no seizure occurred here.  \n[¶95]  Furthermore, based on these facts, officers would be entitled to qualified immunity on \nthe question of a seizure. The law was not clearly established on November 20, 2016 such that a \nreasonable officer would have known using less-lethal munitions in a crowd of hundreds, if not a \nthousand, protestors, in a rural area of North Dakota would constitute a seizure, especially when \nthe officers remained in place, did not encircle or herd protestors in a certain area, and provided a \nmeans for egress, i.e. anywhere south of the Bridge. The officers here did not have fair warning, \nas the limited cases discussed above prior to November 20, 2016 related to this issue do not fit \nhere and no other case was on point at the time of the protest. In addition, recent decisions, \nincluding one out of the Eighth Circuit, highlight how this question of seizure, even today, is \nunsettled. For example, in Alsaada v. City of Columbus, the Ohio court recognized “[w]hether a \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 47 of 91\nconstitutionally  cognizable  seizure  by  control  can  occur  in  protest  scenarios  is  a  murkier \nlandscape,” further noting the question it was required to answer was “Was there a seizure by \ncontrol when the police used less-lethal force, including pepper spray, tear gas, and physical force, \nto disperse—rather than detain—activists, protestors, and congregants?” No. 2:20-CV-3431, 2021 \nWL 1725554, *34 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 30, 2021), modified sub nom. Alsaada v. City of Columbus, \nOhio, No. 2:20-CV-3431, 2021 WL 3375834 (S.D. Ohio June 25, 2021). The court recognized \nthat courts were split on the answer to the question, with some courts answering in the affirmative \nand other courts in the negative.5 Id. In addition, the Eighth Circuit in Quraishi v. St. Charles Cty., \nMissouri, recently reiterated this, finding officers entitled to qualified immunity for the use of tear-\ngas on reporters at a 2014 event:  \nAnderson  argues  that  the  tear-gassing  was  not  a  seizure  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment, and he did not violate clearly established law. This court will address \nthe second point. See Smith[v. Kansas City, Missouri Police Dept., 586 F.3d 576, \n580 (8th Cir. 2009)]. \n \nNeither the district court nor the reporters cite authority that gave “fair warning” to \nAnderson that deploying one canister of tear-gas was a seizure. See Sisney[v. \nReisch, 674 F.3d 839 (8th Cir. 2012)].  \n \nThe district court relied on inapposite law. True, use of pepper spray to arrest an \nunarmed, compliant suspect can be excessive force. Peterson [v. Kopp, 754 F.3d \n594 (8th Cir. 2014)]. Peterson is distinguishable, because it focused on the officer's \nbehavior after the individual was already seized. This court did not consider \nwhether the use of chemical agents alone is a seizure. Id. at 597, 600-01. See, e.g., \nZiglar v. Abbasi, ––– U.S. ––––, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1866, 198 L.Ed.2d 290 (2017) \n(“The dispositive question is whether the violative nature of the particular conduct \nis clearly established.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Here, the \nissue is whether deploying tear gas is a seizure. \n \nThe reporters cite Supreme Court cases to argue they were restrained because they \ncould not stay in their chosen location. Brendlin[v. California, 551 U.S. 249 \n(2007).]; Brower v. Cnty. of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 598-99, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 \n \n5 The court referenced this very Court as answering that question in the negative in its order \ndenying preliminary injunction. However, the Court notes its previous order only foreshadowed \nthe possibility that a seizure would not be found and provided little to no discussion.   \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 48 of 91\nL.Ed.2d 628 (1989). But these cases did not give fair warning. Brendlin held that, \nduring traffic stops, passengers are seized. Brendlin, 551 U.S. at 257, 127 S.Ct. \n2400. Brower held that setting up a roadblock that stops a fleeing suspect is a \nseizure. Brower, 489 U.S. at 598-99, 109 S.Ct. 1378. Brendlin and Brower are \ninapposite because both involve police action that terminated or restricted freedom \nof movement. See Brendlin, 551 U.S. at 257, 127 S.Ct. 2400; Brower, 489 U.S. at \n598-99, 109 S.Ct. 1378. Here, the reporters’ freedom to move was not terminated \nor restricted. See Johnson [v. City of Ferguson, Missouri,, 926 F.3d 504 (8th Cir. \n2019)] (no seizure where plaintiff was not “ordered to stop and remain in place” \nand “was able to leave the scene”). They were dispersed. \n \nThe reporters cite no “precedent,” “controlling authority” or “robust consensus of \ncases of persuasive authority” to show it was clearly established that tear-gassing \nwas a seizure. See [District of Columbia v.]Wesby, [138 S.Ct. 577 (2018)] (internal \ncitations and quotations omitted). See generally Johnson, 926 F.3d at 509 (Melloy, \nJ., dissenting) (noting the Sixth Circuit's holding that person is seized when they \nare not free to stay in place, but also the Second Circuit's holdings that an order to \nleave can become a seizure depending on whether there was physical contact). \n \nWhen Anderson deployed the tear-gas, it was not clearly established that his acts \nwere a seizure. The district court should have granted qualified immunity to \nAnderson on the Fourth Amendment claim. \n \n986 F.3d 831, 840 (8th Cir. 2021).  \n \n[¶96]  No seizure occurred here. In addition, the defendants would be entitled to qualified \nimmunity, as the law was not clearly established at the time of the protest that their actions \nconstituted a seizure.  \nii.  Reasonableness Standard  \n \n[¶97]  “When evaluating a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim under § 1983, [a court] \nconsider[s] ‘whether the amount of force used was objectively reasonable under the particular \ncircumstances.’” Kohorst v. Smith, 968 F.3d 871, 876 (8th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted). The Court \nevaluates “the reasonableness of the force used from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the \nscene, not with the benefit of hindsight.” Id. “This evaluation entails careful consideration of the \ncase’s particular facts and circumstances, including: ‘(1) the severity of the crime at issue; (2) \nwhether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others; and (3) \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 49 of 91\nwhether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” Id. (citing \nGraham, 490 U.S. at 396). The court may “also consider the result of the use of force.” Id.  \n[¶98]  The “reasonableness inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one and looks only \nto whether the official's actions were objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances \nconfronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.” Buckley v. Hennepin \nCty., 9 F.4th 757, 762 (8th Cir. 2021). “The reasonableness of an officer’s use of force must take \ninto  account  that  police  officers  are  often  forced  to  make  split-second  judgments—in \ncircumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is \nnecessary in a particular situation.” Masters v. City of Indep., Missouri, 998 F.3d 827, 836 (8th \nCir. 2021).” “An officer’s evil intentions will not make a Fourth Amendment violation out of an \nobjectively reasonable use of force; nor will an officer’s good intentions make an objectively \nunreasonable use of force constitutional.” Graham, 490 U.S. at 397.  \nA.  Severity of the Crimes at Issue  \n \n[¶99]  The Court must first address whether it was objectively reasonable for officers to believe \nthe Plaintiffs and protestors were committing any crimes at the time force was used against them. \nThe Court will begin with the question of whether Defendants had a reasonable belief that \nPlaintiffs were trespassing in areas where force was used against them. See Habiger v. City of \nFargo, 1996, 80 F.3d 289, certiorari denied 117 S.Ct. 518, 519 U.S. 1011 (“‘The severity of the \ncrime’ as factor justifying use of force does not necessarily encompass whether there was actual \nprobable  cause  to  arrest  the  defendant  for  that  alleged  crime;  touchstone  is  objective \nreasonableness, and the force used to effect a good faith, though false, arrest is not necessarily \nmore likely to be unreasonable than a good faith, though legal, arrest.”); see also Krueger v. Fuhr, \n991 F.2d 435, 439 (8th Cir. 1993) (“An erroneous perception or belief does not violate the Fourth \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 50 of 91\nAmendment if such perception or belief is objectively reasonable. We have already concluded that \nFuhr’s belief that he was facing an armed and dangerous suspect was objectively reasonable. \nTherefore, even assuming that Plaintiffs were able to establish that Krueger was unarmed at the \ntime of the shooting, that fact would not preclude entry of judgment for Officer Fuhr.”).  \n[¶100]  The Plaintiffs and other protestors assert they did not see the “No Trespassing on \nBridge/No Trespassing” signs during the protest and did not know they were trespassing when \nthey were on the Bridge. For those that acknowledged their presence, they stated they thought they \ncould walk on the Bridge up to the barricade but not on the Bridge past it, which was closed off \nby the concertina wire. In their view, no adequate legal notice was given that they were trespassing \non the Bridge on November 20, 2016. Plaintiffs maintain they were allowed to go about freely on \nthe Bridge up to the barricade from October 28, 2016 to November 20, 2016, without being \narrested, so they assumed they could be on the Bridge. However, they admit officers would tell \nthem things like “go back to camp” or “go back south,” when they were previously on the Bridge. \nThey further contend that Defendant Kaiser acknowledged no attempts were made to arrest anyone \nfor trespass on November 20, 2016. Defendants, on the other hand, assert they believed any \nunauthorized person positioned upon the Bridge was trespassing during the protest, because of the \nNo Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing signs, the history surrounding the closure of the Bridge, \nincluding DOT releases, and the warnings they gave Plaintiffs to vacate the Bridge during the \nprotest, both personally and through amplified means.  \n[¶101]  The Plaintiffs argue the DOT releases do not state the Bridge was closed to pedestrian \naccess, only the travelling public. It is true the DOT releases use the words “motorists” and \n“traveling public,” and in one release, it states the Bridge “will remain closed to traffic for the \nsafety of the traveling public.” Doc. No. 59-3. However, most importantly, each of the releases \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 51 of 91\nalso states “the Bridge is unsafe for anyone to cross.” Id. (emphasis added). The releases discuss \nthe fact that the structural integrity of the Bridge was a concern. Even if an ambiguity exists, it is \nhard to envision a situation where an officer, or even a reasonable juror for that matter, would think \nit was safe for a pedestrian to be on the Bridge when engineers were concerned about the safety of \nthe Bridge’s structure. Additionally, Sheriff Kirchmeier testified in his deposition he believed it \nwas  the  DOT  that  put  the  “No  Trespassing  on  Bridge/No  Trespassing”  signs  up,  as  law \nenforcement did not make those signs. It is clear from the record the DOT closed the Bridge. The \nofficers were just enforcing that closure. Nonetheless, the Court finds the releases, combined with \nother evidence that cannot be reasonably refuted, including evidence provided by Plaintiffs \nthemselves, would reasonably lead an officer to believe only authorized personnel were to be \nallowed on the Bridge during the November 20, 2016, protest and that the protestors were \ntrespassing.  \n[¶102]  It is undisputed that all named-Plaintiffs were staying at the camps prior to the November \n20,  2016,  protest.  It  is  also  undisputed  prior  to  the  November  20,  2016  protest,  two  “No \nTrespassing” signs were located in the vicinity of the Bridge. The Plaintiffs admit these facts in \ntheir Amended Complaint. See Doc. No. 129, ¶50 (“Two, ‘No Trespassing’ signs, facing south, \nwere placed behind the concertina wire, north of the Bridge, on the sides of the road.”). A review \nof the evidence, including video and photographic evidence, some of which was offered by the \nPlaintiffs or taken from the protestors’ view, show “No Trespassing on Bridge” signs were located \nto the west and east of the Bridge in the early hours of the protest when the burned-out truck was \nbeing removed from the Bridge and during the height of the November 20, 2016 protest after dark.  \n[¶103]  Photographs taken during the daylight hours of November 20, 2016 when the semi-truck \nis backed up to the burned-out truck show two set of no trespassing signs on the west and east of \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 52 of 91\nthe Bridge. Doc. No. 239-11, p. 1. The pictures depict a large white sign with black lettering that \nreads “No Trespassing on Bridge,” with a smaller sign under it stating “No Trespassing” in red \nlettering on both the west and east sides of the Bridge. Doc. No. 239-11, p. 1. This photograph \ndepicts a small number of protestors working to remove the first burned-out truck, with other \nprotestors walking behind and onto the Bridge. Doc. No. 239-11, p. 1. A video produced by \nPlaintiff Finan during the daylight hours around the time of the first truck’s removal clearly shows \nthe east side “No Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing” signs with a fire burning in the grass \nnear them. Doc. No. 239-12, Exhibit L, Video “Finan Depo Exhibit 43.” A second video taken by \nPlaintiff Finan shows the signs visible from his standpoint farther south of the Bridge when \nprotestors are seen dragging the burned-out vehicle off the Bridge. Doc. No. 239-12, Exhibit L, \nVideo “Finan Depo Exhibit 44.” \n[¶104]  Photographs taken later in the evening also show the signs. One photograph shows a \nsimilar scene with both signs visible, taken later in the evening with lights illuminating the area. \nDoc. No. 239-11, p. 2. A fire is seen burning behind the east set of signs, with protestors taking \npictures of the burned-out truck situation unfolding. Doc. No. 239-11, p. 3. In a photograph taken \nby Plaintiff Finan from atop the Bridge deck during later hours of the protest, after the sun has \ngone down, a large “No Trespassing on Bridge” sign is illuminated. Doc. No. 239-13. In another \nvideo, a protestor is directly in front of the “No Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing” sign set, \nwith  officers  standing  in  the  background.  Doc.  No.  239-12,  Exhibit  L,  Video \n“161120_JonathanKlett_BarricadeBridgeWater_2268.MOV.”  In  yet  another  video,  the  large \nwhite “No Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing” sign set is visible with a growing number of \nprotestors  stationed  in  front  of  it.  Doc.  No.  239-12,  Exhibit  L,  Video \n“161120_PVT_MartinKrafft_0003.MP4.” It also shows a very large, illuminated light shining on \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 53 of 91\nthe protestors and law enforcement. Id. Another video, taken from law enforcements’ view, show \nprotestors lined up directly in front of one set of the “No Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing” \nsigns, cutting the concertina wire, and throwing a piece of it onto the signs. Doc. No. 93, Video, \n“IMG-0181.” After the protestor is seen flailing the wire around and throwing it onto the signs, \nofficers used less-lethal force to get the crowd moved back, with officers removing the piece of \nwire from the signs before backing up. Id. Video footage also shows at some point one of the “No \nTrespassing” sign sets taken down and sitting next to a law enforcement vehicle, the reason for its \nremoval or the time of the removal being unknown. Doc. No. 285, Ex. 7.  \n[¶105]  Aside from the obvious visual evidence showing the presence of the No Trespassing on \nBridge/No trespassing signs, audio footage also confirms warnings were given to the protestors to \nvacate the Bridge. In one video, an officer is clearly heard stating, amplified “I will give you one \nlast warning: vacate the Bridge immediately . . . you’re gonna be trespassing.” Doc. No. 100, \nVideo, RAW CLIP 1 STANDING ROCK POLICE ATTACK NOV202016.mp4.”’ Doc. No. 239-\n12, Exhibit L, Video, “161120-PVT_Bridge_WaterCanonTeargasRubberBullets.mp4” at :07:10. \nOne  third-party  protestor  even  acknowledged  officers  stated  announcements  like  “you’re \ntrespassing and “you’re not supposed to be on the Bridge.” Doc. No. 81-24, ¶22.  Other audio \nportrays officers telling protestors to get back from the concertina wire and barricade at different \npoints. See Doc. No. 239-12, Exhibit L, Video, Bates 1770, 1856, 1879, 1882, 1944, 2035. In \naddition, some of the Plaintiffs and protestors admit that prior to November 20, 2016, they had \nbeen given warnings from officers when they were on the Bridge to “go back home” and “go back \nsouth.”  Officers  also  individually  attested  they  gave  warnings  to  protestors  that  they  were \ntrespassing, including one officer who was in charge of the amplified announcements that night.6  \n \n6 The issuance of warnings and their adequacy will be more fully discussed below.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 54 of 91\n[¶106]  The culmination of this evidence supports a finding that officers reasonably believed the \nPlaintiffs  were  trespassing  and  that  they  were  on  notice  they  were  trespassing.  The  Court \nunderstands  the  mayhem  that  erupted  on  November  20,  2016.  However,  the  video  and \nphotographic evidence undisputedly show two large “No Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing” \nsets of signs on both sides of the Bridge, illuminated during both the early and late hours of the \nprotest. In fact, one of the videos was taken by Plaintiff Finan himself only feet away from the \nsign, documenting the small fire right behind it. In another picture taken by Plaintiff Finan, in the \ndark hours of the protest when he was on the Bridge itself, show the sign illuminated. No \nreasonable juror could find Plaintiff Finan did not know he would be trespassing if he was on the \nBridge. Even taken in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, photographs and videos, provided \nby both sides, show the two sets of signs both visible in the daylight and visible in the night. The \nDOT releases state the Bridge was not safe for anyone to cross. Furthermore, officers attest they \ngave warnings to the Plaintiffs they were trespassing from the start of the protest to the end. The \nvideos show officers giving at least one amplified order to vacate the Bridge and discussing \ntrespassing.  \n[¶107]  The Court is reminded it must look at this situation from the perspective of a reasonable \nofficer on the scene. Kohorst, 968 F.3d at 876. With that as a backdrop, the Court concludes it was \nobjectively reasonable for officers to believe Plaintiffs, all of whom admit to being on the Bridge, \nhad committed or were committing the crime of trespass when force was used upon them. In fact, \nthe evidence leads the Court to conclude the Plaintiffs and protestors were in fact trespassing when \nthey were on the Bridge and in other locations from which officers told them to vacate. However, \ntrespassing was not the only crime the officers believed, and the objective evidence supports, was \nbeing committed during the protest.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 55 of 91\n[¶108]  Pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 24-03-05, which governs removing barricades, it a class A \nmisdemeanor for any person to open, remove, or deface any barricade placed by the North Dakota \nDepartment of Transportation. The Plaintiffs admit they knew the burned-out trucks formed part \nof law enforcement’s barricade on the Bridge. In fact, in video evidence offered, protestors were \nwarned only weeks earlier by law enforcement not to remove the trucks, as the North Dakota \nDepartment of Transportation was responsible for deciding when the trucks came off the Bridge. \nThe Unicorn Riot Video taken on November 20, 2016, exemplifies the protestors blatant disregard \nfor this fact when they drove a semi onto the Bridge and removed one of the burned-out trucks, \nignoring officers’ commands to stop the removal. Dundon admits to being present while the first \ntruck was removed and admits law enforcement used less-lethal force in an attempt to stop \nprotestors from the removal. Officers reasonably could have believed they were justified in using \nforce to prevent the removal of the property, and for reasons more fully discussed below, officers \nwere justified in not feeling safe crossing the barrier at that time to make arrests. See N.D.C.C. § \n12.1-05-06 (“Force is justified if it is used to prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or other \ntrespass in or upon premises, or to prevent an unlawful carrying away or damaging of property.”).  \n[¶109]  Defendants also assert they believed Plaintiffs and protestors were engaged in a riot in \nviolation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-25-01(2). Defendants additionally maintain, and Plaintiffs admit, at \nleast one law enforcement officer was injured, which could support a reasonable belief on law \nenforcement’s side that at least one protestor had assaulted a law enforcement officer in violation \nof North Dakota law. In fact, protestors admit items, such as live canisters, were thrown at law \nenforcement officers throughout the night, and the video evidence confirms that fact. In addition, \nprotestors admit, and the video evidence shows, fires were ignited throughout the night in violation \nof North Dakota law. Fire personnel were called to the scene to put out the fires. The setting of \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 56 of 91\nfires in violation of law warranted the use of water to contain the fire and prevent the spread. Video \nevidence shows protestors purposefully placing themselves in the stream of water. While some of \nthese crimes on their face appear to be non-violent misdemeanors, the culmination of all potential \ncriminal activity clearly set the stage for a purely chaotic, dangerous, and unprecedented encounter \nbetween law enforcement and protestors.  \n[¶110]  The Court must still consider many other circumstances prevalent in this case, including \nthreat to officers or others, whether protestors were resisting lawful orders, which takes into \naccount potential warnings, and other unique factors. See Montoya v. City of Flandreau, 669 F.3d \n867, 871 (8th Cir. 2012) (“Force is least justified against nonviolent misdemeanants who do not \nflee or actively resist arrest and pose little or no threat to the security of the officers or the public.”).  \nB.  Threat  \n \n[¶111]  It is clear and cannot be reasonably disputed that tensions between law enforcement and \nprotestors began rising as early as August of 2016. In fact, in August of 2016, the Morton County \nBoard of Commissioners issued an Emergency Declaration, implementing its emergency plans as \nto additional manpower, resources, and other expenditures to address the protests. Doc. No. 61-4. \nOn August 19, 2016, Governor Dalrymple issued an Executive Order ordering “total utilization of \nthe North Dakota State Emergency Operations Plan” to assist with the protest response efforts. \nDoc. No. 58-2.  \n[¶112]  Over the course of a few short months, peaceful protests may have occurred, but law \nenforcement also responded to numerous incidents where protestors were ultimately arrested, \nincluding the October 27, 2016 confrontation between officers and protestors, which was clearly \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 57 of 91\nchaotic and dangerous.7 Plaintiffs assert, and it is not necessarily disputed, that law enforcement \nbegan responding to these encounters over the months of August to November of 2016 more \nassertively, including with more manpower, vehicles, and presence. The growing manpower came \nfrom multiple sources, including from the then-Governor Dalrymple’s activation of the North \nDakota National Guard on September 8, 2016, the North Dakota Highway Patrol and numerous \ncounty and city law enforcement joining Morton County to assist throughout the months, and the \nState of North Dakota’s Emergency Management Assistance Company request to other states to \nassist with responding to the DAPL protests on October 7, 2016, with officers from Wisconsin, \nSouth Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, Indiana, and Nebraska joining. Doc. Nos. 61-2, p. 16, 61-2, \np. 49, 61-2, p. 41. These officers did not all respond to the November 20, 2016 protest, but rather \nresponded at different times over the course of months. Despite the growing manpower numbers \non the law enforcement side,  aerial  footage of the November 20, 2016 protest  shows law \nenforcement were outnumbered by protestors from the start, which supports why law enforcement \nplaced the two code reds and Signal 100 requesting all available officers in the state to respond to \nthe incident.   \n[¶113]  It is also evident the removal of the first burned-out truck by protestors set the stage for \nthe chaotic November 20, 2016 protest. Video evidence confirms officers had warned protestors \nthey were not to remove the burned-out truck from the Bridge only weeks earlier, emphasizing it \nwas the Department of Transportation who made the final call of when the trucks were removed, \nnot law enforcement. Despite this admonition, during the early evening hours of November 20, \n2016, the protestors backed up a semi on the Bridge, cut the chains securing the first burned-out \n \n7 The Court recognizes that some of these arrests and corresponding charges were ultimately \ndismissed. The Court only makes reference to them in relation to the possible effect they had upon \na reasonable officers’ view of the situation.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 58 of 91\ntruck to the barricade and removed the vehicle from the Bridge, despite officers’ use of less-lethal \nmunitions to try to get them to stop. After the removal, the backed-up semi remained close to the \nBridge.  \n[¶114]  Plaintiffs openly admit that throughout the entire protest law enforcement stayed behind \nthe barricade at all times. Plaintiffs assert they were not trespassing when they were on the Bridge; \nhowever, this Court has already determined a reasonable officer could conclude they were \ntrespassing and committing other violations of state law. While Plaintiffs assert officers could have \njust come and arrested people if they thought they were trespassing, the events of that night as \ndepicted in the videos, photographs, and Plaintiffs’ own admissions, support a reasonable officer’s \nview that the protest had become dangerous for all involved and how that was not likely a \nreasonable option for officers. See also Bernini, 665 F.3d at 1004 (citing Carr v. District of \nColumbia, 587 F.3d 401, 408 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“The D.C. Circuit has addressed the practical \ndilemma faced by officers responsible for reacting to large group activity, and recognized that a \nrequirement that the officers verify that each and every member of a crowd engaged in a specific \nriotous act would be practically impossible in any situation involving a large riot.”).  \n[¶115]  Plaintiffs  assert  even  if  they  were  trespassing  or  committing  other  misdemeanors, \nprotestors did not engage in threatening behavior toward officers or the public the entire protest. \nThey admit “a few items” were thrown at officers, such as water bottles and spent tear gas \ncanisters, but they argue this did not rise to the level of a threat. However, indisputable video \nfootage shows protestors throwing burning projectiles (at least ten instances) and other items back \nat law enforcement from the beginning of the protest that night and throughout it. Doc. No. 92-1, \nitem 4 at meter 1:41:50, 1:59:37, 2:59:40, 3:05:00, 3:07:25. Officers assert police shields were \nrequested on that night for the first time during the ongoing DAPL protests due to the constant \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 59 of 91\nbarrage of objects being thrown at law enforcement. See Doc. No. 54, p. 11. Plaintiffs concede \nthat one officer received injuries. However, the perceived threat does not just come from items \nbeing thrown at law enforcement officers during the protest; it comes from a culmination of actions \ntaken by the protestors. \n[¶116]  Protestors also started, and reignited, numerous fires on the south and north sides of the \nnorth branch of the Cantepeta Creek and on the Bridge itself, which presented the need for water \nin the first place. See Doc. Nos. 56, 57. Plaintiffs do not dispute that protestors started fires on the \nBridge and in the surrounding areas. Doc. No. 81-24, ¶19 (“I saw fires built by the water \nprotector—maybe 3 to 5 controlled bonfires on the mud flat and on the Bridge. I saw people using \nthese fires to dry off their wet clothes and get warm.”). Officers assert one of the bonfires was built \nwithin approximately 30 feet of law enforcements’ barricade and protectors in that vicinity began \nthrowing burning logs at the police line. See Docket No. 54, p. 13. While the protestors assert they \nstarted the fires to stay warm, it was not legal for them to do so, and only contributed to the further \nactions needing to be taken by law enforcement. By starting illegal fires, protestors made the \nsituation more dangerous for themselves and nearby law enforcement. And contrary to protestors’ \nclaim, the fires were not well-maintained bonfires. The fires were dangerous, uncontrolled blazes \nleft to engulf in the dry prairie and presented obvious danger to spread without water suppression.  \n[¶117]  Officers also contend they were forced to respond to a group of 100-150 protestors \ngathering to the west side of the barricade. The officers believed the protestors were going to flank \nthe line, which required them to divert attention to that side of the barricade. One protestor admits \nprotestors were gathering on the mud flat on the northwest side, “maybe trying to spread out the \npolice line.” Doc. No. 81-24, ¶10.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 60 of 91\n[¶118]  The video evidence shows protestors blatantly ignoring officers’ commands to stop the \nremoval of the burned-out trucks that formed part of the barricade separating the two sides, which \nthe protestors had no authority or right to remove, and continuing to do so even after officers used \nforce in an attempt to stop it. Video footage also shows a protestor cutting concertina wire, flailing \nit around and then throwing it on the No Trespassing on Bridge sign set. Additionally, instead of \nretreating from the scene to deescalate the tension, protestors, including named-Plaintiffs, either \nrefused to vacate or left the Bridge and returned to the scene in growing numbers in the area law \nenforcement were using the less-lethal force. In fact, video evidence shows a group of protestors \nholding shields and doing pushes toward the barricade. It is undisputed one protester climbed over \nlaw enforcements’ barricade and was arrested. Perhaps the most telling of the perceived threat is \nthe fact the officers issued two “code reds” and one “Signal-100,” requesting the assistance of \nevery available law enforcement officer in the state – a first in North Dakota history. These \nrequests cannot be taken lightly. Additionally, coming into this protest, law enforcement officers \nclearly were on heightened alert, considering only a month prior at another major protest a woman \nwas arrested for shooting a weapon toward law enforcement. The record supports law enforcement \nofficers’ reasonable perspective that an imminent threat to their safety, the safety of the public, \nand even the safety of the protestors existed. See Doc. Nos. 52, pp. 11-12; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 11, \n13-14, 16-17.  \nC.  Resisting & Warnings  \n \n[¶119]  The Plaintiffs claim a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether officers gave \nwarnings and an ability to retreat prior to the use of force on them. Plaintiffs maintain they along \nwith numerous others, “never heard warnings or announcements to get off the Bridge, that they \nwere trespassing, or that if they did not leave the area they would be subjected to gas, water, and \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 61 of 91\nshot with less lethal munitions.” Doc. No. 275, p. 27. Defendants assert they gave hundreds of \nwarnings throughout the protest to vacate the Bridge and to disperse. In their view, “[i]t wasn’t \nthat Plaintiffs did not receive warnings from law enforcement to remove themselves from the \nlocations where force was applied against them – Plaintiffs simply disregarded the warnings with \nfull knowledge of the possible consequences of doing so.” Doc. No. 283, p. 7. In addition, the \nDefendants argue the Plaintiffs admit to observing officers use less-lethal force and water on other \nprotestors in the same areas where force was later used against them and as a result this shows \nPlaintiffs were warned not to be present where force was being utilized. Doc. No. 238, p. 8.  \n[¶120]  The Eighth Circuit has addressed warnings in the context of when officers use force, \nprimarily deadly force and the use of tasers specifically. Loch v. City of Litchfield, 689 F.3d 961, \n967 (8th Cir. 2012) (“Before employing deadly force, an officer should give “some warning” when \nit is “feasible” to do so.”); Procknow v. Curry, 826 F.3d 1009, 1014 (8th Cir. 2016) (“Timing, \nwarnings,  and  the  physical  capacity  of  a  suspect  are  among  the  many  factors  relevant  to \ndetermining whether use of a taser amounts to excessive force in a particular situation.”). When it \ncomes to less-than-deadly force, especially in the crowd-control context, courts have found \nwarnings should be given if feasible and if the use of force may result in serious injury. See Deorle \nv. Rutherford, 272 F.3d 1272, 1284 (9th Cir. 2001). However, the giving of a warning or the failure \nto do so is only a factor to be considered in applying the Graham balancing test and is not \ndeterminative of whether force was objectively reasonable on its own. Id.  \n[¶121]  Additionally, warnings need only be given if feasible. Jones v. Pierce Cty., No. C13-5280 \nRBL, 2014 WL 4409608, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 8, 2014) (“[T]he law does not require warnings \nin all situations. Officers are required to give a warning only when feasible. Because the feasibility \nof a warning is based on the circumstances, the decision to give a warning necessarily must be \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 62 of 91\nmade by the officer on the scene.”); see also Perkinson v. White, No. 5:13-CT-3004-FL, 2015 WL \n333012, at *4 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 26, 2015) (“[It] is not per se excessive force when a police officer \nfails to warn a suspect before deploying pepper spray.”). Courts have also found there are times \nwhen giving a warning is futile. White v. City of Topeka, 489 F. Supp. 3d 1209, 1229 (D. Kan. \n2020) (“Also, a reasonable jury could agree with the officers’ argument that it would have been \nfutile for the officers to warn Mr. White because he hadn’t complied with their earlier orders.”).  \n[¶122]  Again, when determining if force was objectively reasonable, the Court must look at the \nsituation from the lens of a reasonable officer on the scene. Kohorst, 968 F.3d at 876. The question \nhere is not whether Plaintiffs actually heard the warnings, but rather, whether a reasonable officer \non the scene should give a warning if feasible and knew or had reason to believe the Plaintiffs \nheard their warnings. For example, in Nelson, even though officers attested they had given \nwarnings to the crowd, the Ninth Circuit gave the warnings little weight due to the fact the \nundisputed evidence showed officers issued warnings without amplification into a crowd of over \n1000 people at a distance of 45 to 150 feet. 685 F.3d at 882; see also Lowry v. City of San Diego, \n858 F.3d 1248, 1259 (9th Cir. 2017) (“All three officers testified that Sergeant Nulton issued a \nwarning and repeated it before entering the suite with Bak. Although Lowry did not hear the \nwarnings, the officers did not know and had no reason to know that someone would be in a \nnonresidential building late at night and sleeping so deeply that she would be unable to hear a \nwarning or to be awakened by the officers’ calls.”).8 The Eighth Circuit reiterated this in BurBridge \nv. City of St. Louis, Missouri:  \n \n8 The dissent in an earlier Lowry v. City of San Diego case points out the standard for warnings is \nfrom the officer’s view:  \n \nThe majority explicitly states that the fact that Lowry did not hear the warnings \ndiminishes the weight it is willing to give to the fact that the officer gave warnings. \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 63 of 91\nThe fact that neither Drew nor Jennifer heard the dispersal order, and that both \nrequested to leave the area before arrests began, does not change the Court’s \nqualified immunity determination. No evidence suggests that any of the Defendant \nofficers were aware the BurBridges had asked to leave or hadn’t heard the dispersal \norder. Assuming, arguendo, that no actual probable cause existed to arrest the \nBurBridges because they did not hear the dispersal order or because they had asked \nto  leave,  the  officers  still  had  arguable  probable  cause  because—without \nknowledge of those facts—their mistaken belief that they had probable cause was \nobjectively reasonable. \n \n430 F. Supp. 3d 595, 611 (E.D. Mo. 2019), aff'd, 2 F.4th 774 (8th Cir. 2021).  \n[¶123]  The Plaintiffs assert officers failed to give orders to disperse and failed to give warnings \nprior to the use of force being used upon them. The Plaintiffs contend only one announcement was \nmade at 6:23 p.m., prior to most of the protestors arriving at the Bridge, and it did not tell people \nto leave the area, only to “stay off the Bridge and to remain south of the river shoreline.” Doc. No. \n129, ¶49. Plaintiffs contend from at least 7:00 p.m. on no amplified orders were given to protesters \nand none of the named-Plaintiffs heard an order or warning prior to force being used on them. For \nthe protestors who did hear a command from law enforcement, the Plaintiffs argue officers failed \nto give the protestors the ability to comply prior to using force. In addition, Plaintiffs assert officers \nhad the opportunity and means to give orders but chose not to. Again, the question is not whether \n \nThat is not an evaluation based on the perspective of a reasonable officer on the \nscene. \n. . .  \nAll three officers stated that a warning was given. This factor weighs strongly in \nfavor of the City. See Nelson v. City of Davis, 685 F.3d 867, 882 (9th Cir.2012) \n(quoting Deorle v. Rutherford, 272 F.3d 1272, 1284 (9th Cir.2001) (“‘[T]he giving \nof a warning or the failure to do so is a factor to be considered in applying the \nGraham balancing test.’”)). As noted above, the majority’s observation that Lowry \ndid not hear the warning is irrelevant from the perspective of a reasonable officer \non the scene. The officers had no way to anticipate the unlikely circumstance that \nsomeone would be asleep in a nonresidential building late at night and therefore \nunable to hear a warning. \nLowry v. City of San Diego, 818 F.3d 840, 857 (9th Cir. 2016), on reh'g en banc, 858 F.3d 1248 \n(9th Cir. 2017).  \n \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 64 of 91\nPlaintiffs actually heard the announcements and orders but rather whether a reasonable officer in \nthis situation gave a warning if feasible and gave it in such a way that he or she knew or had reason \nto know the individual did not hear the warning. The Court also considers whether a warning \nwould have been feasible or futile. To determine this, the Court must look at the context of the \nsituation in which the warnings were given.  \n[¶124]  Officers responding to the scene attested warnings were “constantly” being given either \nby officers personally, or through amplified means such as the Bearcat Public Announcement \n(“PA”) system,  or the  LRAD system.  Lieutenant  Ternes testified in  his  deposition that on \nNovember 20, 2016, he personally heard Sergeant Lindelow make announcements using the \nLRAD:  \nQ. Now, you described earlier that Sergeant Lindelow told the people with the semi \nto stop moving the burned-out truck and get off the Bridge; is that right?  \nA. That’s correct.  \nQ. Did you hear Sergeant Lindelow make some subsequent announcements?  \nA. Yes.  \nQ. Was he using the LRAD?  \nA. Yes. The PA on the LRAD, yes.  \nQ. So he was sometimes using the PA and sometimes using the LRAD?  \nA. No. He was using the PA on the LRAD. It’s a function[.]” \n \nSee Doc. No. 239-15, p. 151. A protestor who was at the scene while the first truck was being \nremoved attested he did hear officers state on the bullhorn “Don’t do this Mike. We have 10 more \nof these trucks, and tomorrow we’ll just bring another one in. Go Home!” Doc. No. 81-27. \n[¶125]  Lieutenant Ternes attested he heard Sergeant Lindelow make amplified announcements \nat the entire crowd on the Bridge at times, indicating to them they needed to move to the south \nside of the Bridge. Doc. No. 239-15, pp. 154-155. Lieutenant Ternes also testified he believed the \nLRAD was working that night but that it was used in the early hours of the protest and the \nannouncements then started coming from the PA on the Bearcat instead at some point:  \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 65 of 91\nQ. But you’re saying that – that there was an announcement like you’ve described \nthat was made more than once that night?  \nA. Yes.  \nQ. Using the LRAD?  \nA. Using the LRAD for some time. I – I’ve been told this – I – I absolutely don’t \nhave this in my report – but that sometime during the later hours of the night, way \nlater hours of the night that it went to the PA on the Bearcat. But that’s also \namplified. So – But the LRAD early.  \nQ. Was – as far as you know, was the LRAD working okay that night?  \nA. Yes. \n \nSee  Doc.  No.  239-15,  p.  153.  Lieutenant  Ternes  attested  the  announcement  of,  “You’re \ntrespassing; move to the south side of the Bridge,” was given to protestors “over and over again.” \nDoc. No. 239-15, p. 154. He further stated “[i]t was audible to me where I was, and it was \namplified. So if there is – if there was a -- a change from the LRAD to the amplified PA of the \nBearcat, I heard that from somewhere, but I do not have personal knowledge of whether or not that \nswitched over to a different PA system. I know that it was an amplified system regardless.” Doc. \nNo. 239-15, p. 154. Lieutenant Ternes testified he took over making the announcements after \nSergeant Lindelow, and he used the PA system on the Bearcat. Doc. No. 239-15, p. 156.   \n[¶126]  The video evidence in this case captures some of these amplified announcements, \nincluding a test of the LRAD and a warning to vacate the Bridge. The video evidence also displays \na number of officers giving specific commands to individuals to back away from the barricade. \nThe video evidence portrays a chaotic situation for both law enforcement and protestors. The video \nevidence shows there was praying, singing, yelling, shouting, announcements, the sound of water \nand other munitions being detonated, and overall commotion. As noted by one protestor:  \nI do not recall any warning announcements. At some points the police would say, \n“move off the side of the Bridge;” Once, I heard them say “we are now going to \ntest the LRAD” and they did for a second. That was the only time I heard it. I did \nnot hear, or at least I do not recall hearing, any announcement about them using \nother less lethal weapons. However, it was hard to hear. There was a lot noise and \ncommotion. There were also people singing and praying. If they did. announce \nanything, I could not hear it. I only heard them announce things like “you’re \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 66 of 91\ntrespassing,” “you’re not supposed to be on the Bridge,” and “move to the south \nside.” There were no announcements that were warnings that I can recall.  \n \nDoc. No. 81-24, ¶22 (emphasis added).  \n[¶127]  The record shows officers, particularly Lieutenant Ternes and Sergeant Lindelow, used \namplified means in an attempt to reach protestors. To Lieutenant Ternes it didn’t matter if they \nwere using the Bearcat or the LRAD, they were both amplified systems used to reach crowds. This \ncase is unlike Nelson where the undisputed evidence showed officers had no means to amplify \ntheir warnings and directives and should have known their commands wouldn’t reach the party-\ngoers. A reasonable officer in this situation would recognize the auditory commotion echoing on \nboth sides and would give warnings to protestors in amplified means. The record reveals officers \ndid give amplified warnings and had no reason to believe the protestors could not hear them.  \n[¶128]  Regardless, the Court also tends to agree with the Defendants that additional warnings \nmay have been futile anyway in this specific situation. Plaintiffs and protestors admit to observing \nofficers use less-lethal force against others and despite this, continued to place themselves in close \nproximity to the barricade, sometimes for hours and even returning to the area, despite the use of \nforce. Plaintiffs contend the air was full of smoke near the barricade, there were shots being fired \nand explosives heard, and fire hoses used on those close to the barricade. The Court agrees “No \nreasonable person would observe such alleged use of force by law enforcement standing behind a \nbarricade with armored vehicles and believe their presence was authorized or lawful, regardless of \nwhether any additional warnings were provided by Law enforcement.” Doc. No. 238, p. 41.  \n[¶129]  Sheriff Kaiser attested he did not know whether everyone in the crowd could hear the \nannouncements. Doc. No. 239-14, p. 44. He also testified that he did not recall specifically \nindividuals in the crowd move in reaction to the announcements. Doc. No. 239, p. 46. However, \nPlaintiff Dundon testified in her deposition that protestors, including her, were wearing ear plugs \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 67 of 91\nat the time the group of protestors removed the first burned-out truck from the barricade. She also \ntestified she couldn’t hear anything because there was noise coming from both the protestors \nremoving the truck and from law enforcement’s side. She further testified that even if officers were \ngiving warnings, she would not have been able to hear them with all the noise. Doc. No. 239-1, p. \n159. The video evidence also shows protestors doing pushes toward the barricade, remaining on \nthe Bridge, or leaving the Bridge and coming back, even in light of munitions being used against \nthem.  \n[¶130]  In  this  case,  the  record  displays  auditory  commotion,  but  it  also  includes  officer \nattestations that they gave amplified warnings and announcements through the commotion in an \nattempt to reach protestors. Again, the perspective is from a reasonable officer on scene. Officers \ngave warnings, amplified, as feasible. If protestors did not see or hear these obvious warnings, no \ntrespassing signs were conspicuously visible and illuminated during the protest and commotion. \nNo other reasonable method could have reached protestors in this particular situation.  \nD.  Force \n \n[¶131]  The Plaintiffs contend the type and amount of force deployed by officers was objectively \nunreasonable, especially the use of water. The Plaintiffs contend officers used dangerous weapons \nupon  individuals  causing  grave  injuries  and  also  indiscriminately  used  weapons  against  all \nprotestors assembled. The Plaintiffs contend law enforcement shot tear gas canisters and rubber \nbullets indiscriminately in a way that did not just target those on the Bridge; they assert officers \nlaunched these munitions in a way that impacted even those not on the Bridge to the south. They \nalso assert more than one legal observer witnessed law enforcement launch “as many as 20 \nchemical agent canisters launched in the span of 30 seconds.” Doc. No. 81-28, ¶8. The Plaintiffs \nassert officers used unprovoked force on individuals who they maintain were not threatening \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 68 of 91\npolice. However, they have failed to identify any of the officers in these specific instances and the \nvideos are only snippets which fail to provide the broader context of what was occurring around \nthem and throughout the protests.  \n[¶132]  Plaintiffs further assert law enforcement did not use a continuum of force, starting with \nthe least impactful munitions and moving to more impactful as the protest went on. They assert \nthere was no de-escalation from 5:00 p.m. when the protest started until the protest ended. In \naddition, Plaintiffs assert officers continued to use force on individuals who were moving away \nfrom the barricade, referring to Plaintiff Dundon who was hit in the eye as she asserts she tried to \nrun away from the force.  \n[¶133]  The Plaintiffs also maintain the resulting injuries were severe as a result of the force. For \nexample, Plaintiff Dundon asserts she suffered severe and permanent damage to her eye, Plaintiff \nDemo maintains his compound fracture required reconstructive surgery, and other Plaintiffs and \nprotestors suffered bruises, bleeding, fractured bones, the near-loss of an arm, internal bleeding, \nand hypothermia. According to Plaintiffs medical personnel treated at least 300 protestors. Doc. \nNo. 271. Dr. Niheu, M.D. personally assisted in the medical treatment of protestors on November \n20, 2016. Dr. Niheu asserts at least 26 severely injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance \nto three area hospitals. Doc. No. 271, ¶6.  \n[¶134]  It is undisputed this protest lasted over the course of approximately ten hours. It is \nundisputed officers used less-lethal force at the very beginning of the protest when protestors \nremoved the burned-out truck off the Bridge with a semi against law enforcement orders. Plaintiffs \nadmit this use of force did not stop protestors from removing the truck. It also did not stop \nprotestors from continuing to pool in numbers on the Bridge, the sides of it, and in numbers behind \nit. Almost all Plaintiffs also admit they returned to the Bridge after tear gas, rubber bullets, water, \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 69 of 91\nand other munitions had already been used on them in an effort to get them to disperse or leave \nthe scene. The aerial footage and videos provided in this case show protestors pushing toward the \nbarricade even in the face of law enforcement officers using less-lethal munitions. Officers had \nissued two code reds and a Signal 100 seeking immediate assistance from officers in not only the \narea but the entire state. The undisputed evidence leads only to one conclusion that no reasonable \njuror could find the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, OC spray, and the like, was objectively \nunreasonable in this particular circumstance.  \n[¶135]  As for the use of water specifically, Plaintiffs contend officers sprayed water directly at \nprotestors who were praying, singing, talking, and not doing anything threatening toward law \nenforcement officers. They also contend officers were spraying water in the air in such a way that \nprotestors south of the Bridge were being sprayed with water. They assert this happened almost \ncontinuously throughout the night, a night in which the temperature was in the low teens and \ntwenties. Plaintiffs’ expert, who was not personally present at the protest but reviewed videos and \nevidence after, asserted the use of water would not be considered appropriate. Doc. No. 270, p. 12.  \n[¶136]  Defendants  contend aerial footage and protestor declarations  establish there was a \nsubstantial time delay between when the first burned-out truck was removed and the use of water. \nOne protestor admits officers utilized tear gas and rubber bullets on the rapidly growing crowd for \napproximately an hour and half before water was first deployed. Doc. No. 81-27, ¶20. One officer \ncontends prior to the use of water, the OC spray and gas, along with less-lethal direct impact rounds \nwere not effective against protestors’ response. Doc. No. 53, ¶32. Plaintiffs themselves admit they \neither stayed on the Bridge or left and returned even after other forms of force were used against \nthem. The same rang true for the use of water by other protestors. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 70 of 91\n[¶137]  One officer also recognized the use of spray and gas were not effective because of the \nwind, causing the agents to blow back at them. Plaintiff Dundon concedes the wind created \nproblems for law enforcement officers because after they launched munitions such as tear gas the \nwind would blow it back onto them. See Doc. No. 239-1, p. 309-310 (“I’ve seen them literally \nlaunch stuff off and then smoke themselves out. Like it happened a few times. They would set the \ntear gas off, and it was so windy, the wind would literally blow it right back on them, and they \nwould end up tear gassing themselves. . . they did this many times.”). Officers then moved to water \nas the next available means of keeping protestors off the Bridge and away from the barricade. Doc. \nNo. 53, ¶32.   \n[¶138]  The  Court  has  reviewed  the  video  footage,  affidavits  of  Plaintiffs  and  protestors, \naffidavits of law enforcement, and affidavits of fire professionals, among other pieces of evidence \nrelated to the use of water specifically by law enforcement and fire professionals in the crowd \ncontrol context. The Court, and the parties admittedly, were unable to locate a single case where \nit was found to be unconstitutional for officers to use water as a means of crowd-control in a \nsituation  involving  threatening  behavior,  destruction  and  removal  of  government  property, \nprevious failed attempts at dispersal with other forms of less-lethal munitions, and a clearly \noutnumbered law enforcement, among other factors. This itself protects law enforcement under \nqualified immunity from their actions related to the use of water.  \n[¶139]  Based on the totality of the circumstances in this specific case, the Court finds the \nundisputed and irrefutable evidence in this case could only lead a reasonable juror to conclude the \nofficers’ conduct in this case was objectively reasonable. Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs’ Fourth \nAmendment claim ultimately fails under the second prong of qualified immunity, as the law was \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 71 of 91\nnot clearly established in November 20, 2016 to put a reasonable officer on notice that the actions \nthey took during the protest were violations of the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  \niii.  Even  assuming  a  Fourth  Amendment  violation  occurred,  the \nDefendants are entitled to Qualified Immunity  \n \n[¶140]  “To be clearly established, a legal principle must have a sufficiently clear foundation in \nthen-existing precedent.” Graham v. Barnette, 5 F.4th 872, 887 (8th Cir. 2021), reh'g denied (Aug. \n20, 2021). “This generally requires a plaintiff to ‘point to existing circuit precedent that involves \nsufficiently ‘similar facts’ to ‘squarely govern’ the officers’ conduct in the specific circumstances \nat issue, or, in the absence of binding precedent, to present ‘a robust consensus of cases of \npersuasive authority’ constituting settled law.” Id. (citing De La Rosa v. White, 852 F.3d 740, 745 \n(8th Cir. 2017). Boudoin v. Harsson, 962 F.3d 1034, 1040 (8th Cir. 2020) (alterations to original)). \n“The plaintiff has the burden to prove that a right was clearly established at the time of the alleged \nviolation. Id. (citing Wilson v. Lamp, 901 F.3d 981, 986 (8th Cir. 2018)). \n[¶141]  “For the purposes of step two, “clearly established” means “[t]he contours of the right \nmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates \nthat right.” Id. While qualified immunity “does not require a case directly on point for a right to \nbe clearly established, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question \nbeyond debate.” White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017) (citations omitted). “We . . . look to \nall available decisional law, including decisions from other courts, federal and state, when there is \nno binding precedent in this circuit.” Meloy v. Bachmeier, 302 F.3d 845, 848 (8th Cir. 2002). \n“[G]eneral statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning so \nlong as the unlawfulness is apparent.” Dean v. Searcey, 893 F.3d 504, 518 (8th Cir. 2018), cert. \ndenied, 139 S. Ct. 1291, 203 L. Ed. 2d 414 (2019).  \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 72 of 91\n[¶142]  This Court is required to evaluate the Defendants defense of qualified immunity from the \nperspective of a reasonable police officer based on facts available to the officer at the time of the \nalleged constitutional violation. Gladden v. Richbourg, 759 F.3d 960, 964 (8th Cir. 2014). If \n“based on those facts, the officer reasonably failed to comprehend that he was violating a person’s \nclearly established constitutional rights, he is entitled to qualified immunity from suit.” Id.  \n[¶143]  Protests have been occurring in the United States since long before the November 20, \n2016 protest. However, this protest was utterly unique. Thousands of protestors, including the \nnamed-Plaintiffs, came from all over the United States to join their cause of protesting against the \nDakota Access Pipeline. Protestors set up camps, staying for extended periods of time. Aerial \nfootage of the protest on November 20, 2016 shows hundreds of, if not a thousand, protestors \nstanding on the Bridge, lining the sides of it, and pooling in numbers behind it. The aerial footage \nalso shows over the hours of the protest a growing, but unequaled, police presence. While the \nPlaintiffs assert law enforcement were not outnumbered, the video footage and evidence show \notherwise. This protest took place in a rural area of North Dakota. It did not take place in an area \nable to be easily physically cordoned off, such as a busy street in a major city. It included miles of \nhills and prairie.  \n[¶144]  Furthermore, how protestors and law enforcement were stationed is also unique. It is \nundisputed that on November 20, 2016, a barricade was set up across the Backwater Bridge, which \nincluded two burned-out trucks. Plaintiffs openly admit that throughout the entire protest law \nenforcement stayed behind the barricade at all times. Plaintiffs assert they were not trespassing \nwhen they were on the Bridge; however, this Court has already determined the Plaintiffs had no \nlawful right to be on the Bridge at the time in question and at minimum, an officer would have \nreasonably believed the Plaintiffs were on notice their presence was unlawful based upon the \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 73 of 91\nposted “No Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing” signs, DOT information, and warnings. While \nPlaintiffs assert officers could have just come and arrested people if they thought they were \ntrespassing, one need only look at the video evidence of events of that night to observe how \ndangerous the protest had become for all involved and how that was not likely a reasonable option \nfor officers. See also Bernini, 665 F.3d at 1004 (citing Carr v. District of Columbia, 587 F.3d 401, \n408 (D.C.Cir.2009) (“The D.C. Circuit has addressed the practical dilemma faced by officers \nresponsible for reacting to large group activity, and recognized that a requirement that the officers \nverify that each and every member of a crowd engaged in a specific riotous act would be practically \nimpossible in any situation involving a large riot.”).  \n[¶145]  Plaintiffs assert protestors did not engage in threatening behavior toward officers or the \npublic. They admit “a few items” were thrown at officers, such as water bottles and spent tear gas \ncanisters, but they argue this did not rise to the level of a threat. However, video footage shows \nprotestors  throwing  burning  projectiles  and  other  items  back  at  law  enforcement  from  the \nbeginning of the protest and throughout it. Doc. No. 92-1, item 4 at meter 1:41:50, 1:59:37, \n2:59:40, 3:05:00, 3:07:25). Officers assert police shields were requested for the first time during \nthe ongoing DAPL protests due to the constant barrage of objects being thrown at law enforcement. \nSee Docket No. 54, p. 11.  Protestors also started, and reignited, numerous fires on the south and \nnorth sides of the north branch of the Cantepeta Creek and on the Bridge itself, which presented \nthe need for water in the first place. See Doc. Nos. 56, 57.  \n[¶146]  The video evidence shows protestors blatantly ignoring officers’ commands to stop the \nremoval of the burned-out trucks that formed part of the barricade separating the two sides, which \nthe protestors had no authority or right to remove, and continuing to do so even after officers used \nforce in an attempt to stop it. Video footage also shows a protestor cutting concertina wire. \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 74 of 91\nAdditionally, instead of retreating from the scene to deescalate the tension, protestors, including \nnamed-Plaintiffs, either refused to vacate or left the Bridge and returned to the scene in growing \nnumbers in the area law enforcement were using the less-lethal force. In fact, video evidence shows \na group of protestors holding shields and doing pushes toward the barricade. It is undisputed one \nprotester climbed over law enforcements’ barricade and was the only person arrested. See Docket \nNo. 54, p. 15.   \n[¶147]  The record reveals law enforcement officers feared for their physical safety due to the \nimminent threats of serious bodily injury or death they were encountering.  See Docket Nos. 52, \npp. 11-12; 53, p. 12; 54, pp. 11, 13-14, 16-17. It is undisputed two code reds and a “Signal-100” \nwas issued by law enforcement, requesting the assistance of all available law enforcement, state-\nwide. See Docket No. 54, p. 14.  These requests cannot be taken lightly and only lend credence to \nthe fact that chaos was ensuing. Furthermore, the undisputed evidence in the record shows that \nover the course of months, tensions between protestors and law enforcement were growing. In fact, \nonly a month prior, a similarly chaotic encounter developed, with one protestor shooting three \ntimes at law enforcement, ultimately being convicted of a firearms charge. This protest surely only \nintensified fears on both sides. The resulting situation on November 20, 2016 was unprecedented \nnot only for a small state like North Dakota, but also on a national level. The Court has determined \nthe cases cited by Plaintiffs do not show it was clearly established at the time of the protest that a \nreasonable officer would have known they were violating the constitutional rights of the Plaintiffs \nand protestors by using less-lethal force. The Court will discuss the cases cited by Plaintiffs and \nDefendants and why they are not applicable here.  \n[¶148]  The Plaintiffs’ citations to cases involving one officer and one defendant or a small \nnumber of each do not possess “similar facts to squarely govern the officers’ conduct in the specific \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 75 of 91\ncircumstances at issue[.]” Id. In many of these cases offered by Plaintiffs, an officer is presented \nwith a situation involving the use of force against a single individual in a somewhat controlled \narea. See Montoya v. City of Flandreau, 669 F.3d 867 (8th Cir. 2012); Brown v. City of Golden \nValley, 574 F.3d 491 (8th Cir. 2009); Deorle v. Rutherford, 272 F.3d 1272 (9th Cir. 2001); Small \nv. McCrystal, 708 F.3d 997 (8th Cir. 2013); Ellison v. Lesher, 796 F.3d 910 (8th Cir. 2015). What \nreasonable officer may believe to be lawful in these smaller situations does not instruct how a \nreasonable officer may view his or her actions involving a large-scale protest with hundreds, if not \nover a thousand, protestors in a rural, uncontrolled area. Bernini, 665 F.3d at 1003 (“What is \nreasonable in the context of a potential large-scale urban riot may be different from what is \nreasonable in the relative calm of a tavern with a dozen patrons.”). Nonetheless, even if the Court \nconsidered  the  takeaway  from  these  cases  that  “force  is  least  justified  against  nonviolent \nmisdemeanants who do not flee or actively resist arrest and pose little or no threat to the security \nof the officers or the public,” the undisputed and irrefutable facts of this case show officers \nreasonably believed there was more than an immediate threat to the security of the officers, public, \nand even protestors, as discussed above. Therefore, they are inapplicable here.  \n[¶149]  As for the few cases involving protests occurring before November 20, 2016 to which \nthe Plaintiffs cite, those too are inapplicable. While Fogarty v. Gallegos, 523 F.3d 1147 (10th Cir. \n2008), centered around the arrest of a single individual in a large group of protestors, the Court \ndenied qualified immunity because the Court found the evidence supported a finding that he and \nother protestors did not pose an intermediate threat to officers or the public, and officers’ main \nobjective was to disperse the crowd and avoid disruption to local businesses, not quelling an \nimmediate threat. Id. at 1160. Again, those facts are not present here. The evidence in this case \nshows officers reasonably believed they were in a defensive position of an immediate threat.  \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 76 of 91\n[¶150]  Furthermore, while the Plaintiffs cite to Nelson v. City of Davis, 685 F.3d 867 (9th Cir. \n2012) for the proposition that “cases dating back to 2001 have established that a failure to fully or \nimmediately comply with an officer’s orders does not justify the application of a non-trivial \namount of force,” the circumstances of this case include more than just protestors’ failure to \ncomply with an order. Here, officers reasonably believed an immediate threat to their safety and \nothers was present as they issued two code red requests and a Signal 100 that night. Nelson also \ninvolved a situation where the court found the protestors did not pose any visible threat to officers. \n685 F.3d at 883 (“It is clear . . . the governmental interest in applying force to Nelson or any \nmember of his group, party-goers posing no visible threat and demonstrating no unwillingness to \ncomply with the officers' orders, was minimal at best.”). If anything, these cases put officers on \nnotice that the use of force was justified in a large protest context where they had a reasonable \nbelief that injury to themselves or others would occur.  \n[¶151]  Plaintiffs and Defendants also cite to a handful of cases decided after November 20, 2016, \nwhich the Court will not consider for purposes of this analysis here. The qualified immunity \nstandard requires the Court to look at “[whether] the right was clearly established at the time of \nthe deprivation.” Jones v. McNeese, 675 F.3d 1158, 1161 (8th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added).  \n[¶152]  Defendants rely again heavily on Bernini. In Bernini, the court also addressed whether \nthe officers’ use of force in moving the crowd was objectively reasonable. The Eighth Circuit \nnoted there was no evidence in the record that any of the defendants directly used force against \nany of the plaintiffs. Id. at 1006. Instead, the plaintiffs focused on the actions of a lead sergeant \nwho testified he deployed various non-lethal munitions and when he did so, his actions implicitly \nallowed officers under him to do the same. Id.  The Eighth Circuit found the lead sergeant was \nentitled to qualified immunity. Id. The following facts supported the Circuit’s conclusion:   \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 77 of 91\nIn our view, the use of force was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. At a \nminimum, it was not objectively unreasonable for Henry to authorize the force \ndeployed  in  light  of  clearly  established  law.  The  circumstances  led  officers \nreasonably to believe that a growing crowd intended to penetrate a police line and \naccess  downtown  St.  Paul.  Henry’s  use  and  authorization  to  use  non-lethal \nmunitions to direct the crowd away from the intersection and toward a park where \nthe crowd could be controlled did not violate clearly established rights. \n \nThe plaintiffs contend that it was unreasonable for the officers to continue to use \nforce  as  the  crowd  moved  west  on  Shepard  Road,  because  the  crowd  was \n“complying with the movement of the officers and posed no threat to the officers.” \nThe video footage reveals, however, that some people would not leave the roadway \nand that some turned east and faced the officers. It was reasonable for the officers \nto deploy non-lethal munitions to keep all members of the crowd moving west. \n \nSome  plaintiffs  assert  that  they  were  directly  targeted  by  officers—one,  for \nexample, testified that an officer sprayed a chemical irritant on his face, neck, ears, \nand back. But there is no evidence that Henry authorized this type of force against \na compliant individual. His implicit authorization occurred at the intersection and \ninvolved force deployed against a noncompliant crowd. The plaintiffs have not \nidentified any defendant who used gratuitous force. The evidence, therefore, does \nnot support the conclusion that Henry or any other defendant violated clearly \nestablished rights under the Fourth Amendment. The district court properly granted \nsummary judgment on this claim.  \nId. at 1006.  \n[¶153]  The Court agrees with Defendants that Bernini and this case possess many similarities. \nIn both instances, officers used less-lethal force to keep individuals away from or out of a specific \narea. Both situations involved officers calling for backup, with the officers in this case calling for \nnot only those available in the area but also any and every available officer in the state. Both \nsituations involved both complying and non-complying protestors. However, the Court also \nrecognizes that Bernini and this case have differences, with this case possessing an even more \nintense situation. This case did not involve moving protestors in a controlled area. Instead, as noted \nabove, the events of November 20, 2016, took place in rural North Dakota, with hundreds, if not \na thousand, protestors. This protest also constituted a continuum of tense occurrences between law \nenforcement and protestors stemming for months whereas Bernini involved one occurrence. \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 78 of 91\nDespite the differences, the Court concludes Bernini does govern here. If officers were found to \nhave constitutionally used force in an even less intense crowd-control situation such as Bernini, \nthen clearly a reasonable officer in this situation would not have been on notice their actions were \nunconstitutional.  \n[¶154]  If Bernini was inapplicable, however, then there would not be any existing precedent that \nplaces the “statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.” White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, \n551  (2017)  (citations  omitted)  (emphasis  added).  There  does  not  appear  to  be  any  other \n“precedent,” “controlling authority,” or a “robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority” \nfitting this situation. Quraishi v. St. Charles Cty., Missouri, 986 F.3d 831, 835 (8th Cir. 2021). Nor \nis there the ““rare ‘obvious case’ where the unlawfulness of the officer's conduct is sufficiently \nclear even though existing precedent does not address similar circumstances.” Id. Therefore, even \nif the Plaintiffs would have provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find officers’ use \nof force was unconstitutional on November 20, 2016, the law was not clearly established at that \ntime such that a reasonable officer would have known they were acting in a manner which deprived \nthe Plaintiffs and protestors of their right to be free from excessive force. The Defendants are \nentitled to qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment excessive force claim.  \nb.  FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT  \n[¶155]  If the Plaintiffs’ excessive force claim does not fit neatly within the Fourth Amendment, \nthey may bring it through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has grounded the \nstandard to be applied in Fourteenth Amendment excessive force cases as those applications of \nforce that “shock the conscience.” Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 844-45 (1998). \n“The  touchstone  of  due  process  is  protection  of  the  individual  against  arbitrary  action  of \ngovernment, whether the fault lies in a denial of fundamental procedural fairness, or in the exercise \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 79 of 91\nof  power  without  any  reasonable  justification  in  the  service  of  a  legitimate  governmental \nobjective.” Id. at 845-46. (alterations). “While the measure of what is conscience shocking is no \ncalibrated yard stick, it does, as Judge Friendly put it, ‘poin[t] the way.’” Id. “Whether conduct \nshocks the conscience is a question of law.” Id. Conscience shocking conduct only includes “the \nmost severe violations of individual rights that result from the brutal and inhumane abuse of \nofficial power.” Id. (citing White v. Smith, 696 F.3d 740, 757–58 (8th Cir. 2012)). “[T]he alleged \nsubstantive due process violations must involve conduct ‘so severe . . . so disproportionate to the \nneed presented, and . . . so inspired by malice or sadism rather than a merely careless or unwise \nexcess of zeal that it amounted to a brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking \nto the conscience.’” Truong, 829 F.3d at 631.  \n[¶156]   For largely the same reasons as noted above, the Court finds the undisputed evidence \ncould only lead a reasonable juror to determine the officers’ actions in this case do not shock the \nconscience. The Court has already concluded it was reasonable for officers to believe Plaintiffs \nwere committing or had committed violations of state law and were unlawfully positioned in areas \nwhere officers used both warnings and force to get them to move. Based upon this record, the \nCourt finds the evidence can only lead to the conclusion that Plaintiffs were in fact trespassing. \nThe undisputed evidence also shows that instead of retreating from the situation, almost all-named \nPlaintiffs either stayed on the Bridge or returned to it, which clearly escalated the situation in a \nreasonable officer’s mind. Video footage shows protestors charging forward toward the barricade, \ncutting concertina wire, yelling profanities at officers, throwing items, including live canisters, \nremoving parts of the barricade, including the removal of the burned-out truck, which they had no \nauthority or right to do. The most telling of the entire situation is the fact that officers issued two \ncode red requests and a Signal 100, requesting the assistance of every available officer in the state. \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 80 of 91\nThis has never been done in North Dakota history. Despite the growing police presence, the aerial \nfootage still shows officers outnumbered by protestors, who continued to flood the area for hours. \nThe undisputed evidence shows the actions of officers may not have been perfect, but a reasonable \njury could not find they shock the conscience. Additionally, if the law was not clearly established \nat the time of the protest that the Defendants were in violation of the Fourth Amendment, clearly \nit was not established for the Fourteenth. See Gonzales v. Passino, 222 F. Supp. 2d 1277, 1280 \n(D.N.M. 2002) (“The level of egregiousness needed to establish a violation of substantive due \nprocess is much higher than will suffice to prove  excessive force during a seizure.”). The \nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claim.  \nc.  EQUAL PROTECTION \n[¶157]  “The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution prohibits a state from denying ‘to any person within its jurisdiction the  equal \nprotection of the laws.’” Walker v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 831 F.3d 968, 976 (8th Cir. \n2016) (citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1). “The purpose of the equal protection clause ... is to \nsecure  every  person  within  the  State’s  jurisdiction  against  intentional  and  arbitrary \ndiscrimination.” Id. (quoting Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Township of Wakefield, 247 U.S. 350, 352 \n(1918)). The Equal Protection Clause requires states to treat similarly situated persons alike, but a \nstate may treat dissimilarly situated persons dissimilarly without violating the Equal Protection \nClause.  Ganley v. Minneapolis Park & Recreation Bd., 491 F.3d 743, 747 (8th Cir. 2007).  \n[¶158]  “To prove an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that he or she was singled \nout and treated differently from persons similarly situated, and (2) that the plaintiff was singled \nout on the basis of a prohibited characteristic, such as race.” Dahlsten v. Lee, 531 F. Supp. 2d \n1029, 1043 (N.D. Iowa 2008) (citing Ellebracht v. Police Bd. of Metro. Police Dep't of St. Louis, \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 81 of 91\n137 F.3d 563, 566 (8th Cir.1998)). “A plaintiff bears the burden of proving that he is similarly \nsituated to those whom he compares himself to ‘in all relevant respects.’” Id. (citing Carter v. \nArkansas, 392 F.3d 965, 968 (8th Cir.2004)). A plaintiff's failure to demonstrate that he or she is \n“similarly situated to those who allegedly receive favorable treatment” precludes the viability of \nan equal-protection claim because the Equal Protection Clause does not preclude dissimilar \ntreatment of dissimilarly situated entities. Klinger v. Dep’t of Corr., 31 F.3d 727, 731 (8th Cir. \n1994). Accordingly, the threshold inquiry is whether the Plaintiffs are similarly situated to any \nperson allegedly receiving favorable treatment by law enforcement the night of the protest.  \n[¶159]  The Plaintiffs maintain law enforcement indiscriminately applied force to essentially \neveryone located in close proximity to the barricade, i.e. everyone similarly situated to Plaintiffs. \nThe Plaintiffs admit as much in their Amended Complaint. See Doc. No. 129, ¶54 (“Defendants \nand other law enforcement officers unleashed a barrage of freezing water, chemical agents, SIM, \nand explosive grenades directed toward the entire crowd, for many hours, throughout the night and \ninto the early morning.”); see also id. at ¶55 (“Defendants indiscriminately shot, launched, and \nsprayed their weapons on all person who were present in the general area of the Backwater \nBridge.”).  \n[¶160]  It appears Plaintiffs attempt to argue that if another person not associated with the \nPlaintiffs or protestors was suspected of trespass, officers would not have responded by shooting \nchemical agents, munitions, and water cannons. This is purely hypothetical. “[A]n equal protection \nviolation cannot be founded on theoretical possibilities.” Walker v. Nelson, 863 F. Supp. 1059, \n1065 (D. Neb. 1994), aff’d in part, 70 F.3d 1276 (8th Cir. 1995). Plaintiffs have failed to put forth \nor point to evidence in the record of dissimilar treatment of similarly situated individuals.  \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 82 of 91\n[¶161]  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs also failed to show officers used force against them because of \nany of their alleged protected classes, such as race, religion, or political views or because of their \nexercise of constitutional rights. “The mere fact of different treatment is not enough to warrant \napplication of the equal protection clause. Those invoking constitutional protection must show \nthey were discriminated against.” Mastrian v. Schoen, 725 F.2d 1164, 1166 (8th Cir. 1984); see \nalso Stamm v. Cty. of Cheyenne, Nebraska, 326 F. Supp. 3d 832, 859 (D. Neb. 2018) (“To state a \nclaim  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  a  § 1983  plaintiff  must  allege  that  a  state  actor \nintentionally discriminated against the plaintiff because of membership in a protected class.”).  \n[¶162]  For example, Plaintiffs argue Defendants used force against them for their political \nbeliefs against fossil fuel, their religious beliefs regarding the need to protect and honor water, and \ntheir status as Indigenous persons or those who associate with them. They argue they were peaceful \nand not committing any crime, and that officers used force on individuals who were praying or \notherwise exercising their rights to associate. While it is undisputed officers used force on \nindividuals who may have been praying, it was not because they were praying that force was used. \nThe same is true for those Plaintiffs asserting they were targeted because of their race. In fact, \nPlaintiffs admit, and the video footage shows, they and other protestors were wearing goggles, \nbearing shields, and otherwise wearing clothing that would make it hard for an officer to determine \nif a person was a member of a protected class.  \n[¶163]  Given the entire situation presented, which was no less than chaos, the evidence shows \nofficers using force on numerous protestors stationed on the Bridge in an attempt to remove them, \nas they were trespassing on a Bridge the DOT deemed “unsafe for anyone to cross.” All Plaintiffs \nadmit to being present on the Bridge when force was used against them. They also admit hundreds \nof protestors were present that night and that officers had been using less-lethal force against others \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 83 of 91\nbefore they arrived. In addition, the video evidence also shows officers using force against \nprotestors who were cutting concertina wire and refusing to obey commands to back away from \nthe barricade, among other instances, including when protestors removed the first burned-out truck \nagainst law enforcement warnings not to do so. Law enforcement had legitimate and compelling \nreasons for using force that had nothing to do with Plaintiffs’ protected or unprotected classes. The \nevidence clearly shows force was not used because the Plaintiffs were Indigenous or disliked fossil \nfuels. As a result, the Court will not apply strict scrutiny to the actions of law enforcement and \ninstead only looks to whether the actions meet rational basis. See Stevenson v. Blytheville Sch. \nDist. #5, 800 F.3d 955 (8th Cir. 2015) (Equal protection claim will be reviewed under strict \nscrutiny only if it can be proved that action was motivated by racial purpose or object, or if it is \nunexplainable on grounds other than race.).  \n[¶164]  Clearly, here, law enforcement had legitimate, even compelling, interests in removing \nprotestors from an area which had been deemed unsafe that they were unlawfully congregating in \nand also continuously returning to, and further had a legitimate interest in attempting to restore \norder to a rapidly evolving disordered situation. The actions of law enforcement here relate to a \nlegitimate end. See Walker v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 831 F.3d 968 (8th Cir. 2016) \n(“Under rational-basis review for an equal protection violation, the court will uphold the [] \nclassification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end, and an equal protection \nchallenge will fail if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational \nbasis for the classification.”). The Court finds the undisputed evidence forecloses the possibility \nthat a reasonable juror could find in their favor. As a result, the Defendants are entitled to summary \njudgment on the Equal Protection claim.  \n \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 84 of 91\nd.  FIRST AMENDMENT RETALIATION  \n[¶165]  “It is well-settled that ‘as a general matter the First Amendment prohibits government \nofficials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions . . . on the basis of his constitutionally \nprotected speech.’ Osborne v. Grussing, 477 F.3d 1002, 1005 (8th Cir. 2007). To establish a § \n1983 claim for retaliation in violation of the First Amendment, a plaintiff must allege (1) that he \nengaged in a protected activity, (2) that the defendants responded with adverse action that would \n“chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing in the activity,” and (3) that “the adverse \naction was motivated at least in part by the exercise of the protected activity.” L.L. Nelson \nEnterprises, Inc. v. Cty. of St. Louis, Mo., 673 F.3d 799, 807–08 (8th Cir. 2012).  \n[¶166]   “The ordinary-firmness test is well established in the case law and is designed to weed \nout trivial matters from those deserving the time of the courts as real and substantial violations of \nthe First Amendment.” Garcia v. City of Trenton, 348 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir. 2003). “The test is \nan objective one, not subjective.” Id. “The question is not whether the plaintiff herself was \ndeterred, though how plaintiff acted might be evidence of what a reasonable person would have \ndone.” Id. “When applying the ordinary firmness test, courts should be ‘mindful’ that the ‘effect \non freedom of speech may be small, but since there is no justification for harassing people for \nexercising their constitutional rights it need not be great in order to be actionable.’” Taylor v. \nHaugaard, 360 F. Supp. 3d 923, 931 (D.S.D. 2019).  \n[¶167]  Plaintiffs  must  additionally  prove  causation.  “To  prevail  in  an  action  for  First \nAmendment retaliation, ‘plaintiff must show a causal connection between a defendant's retaliatory \nanimus and [plaintiff's] subsequent injury.’” Baribeau v. City of Minneapolis, 596 F.3d 465, 481 \n(8th Cir. 2010). “Retaliation need not have been the sole motive, but it must have been a \n‘substantial factor’ in” the decision[.]” Id. “Furthermore, the plaintiff must show that the retaliatory \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 85 of 91\nmotive was a but-for cause of the harm; that is, that the plaintiff was “singled out” for adverse \ntreatment because of his exercise of constitutional rights.” Kilpatrick v. King, 499 F.3d 759, 767 \n(8th Cir. 2007). \n[¶168]  The parties largely disagree as to whether the Plaintiffs were engaged in a protected \nactivity when force was used against them and whether officers used force because the Plaintiffs \nwere allegedly engaged in a protected activity. The Defendants assert the Plaintiffs’ unlawful \nactivity, namely trespassing, precludes a finding they were engaged in a protected activity. \nDefendants assert Plaintiffs and other protestors had no constitutional right to express their views \non the closed Bridge or any location where force was applied by Law Enforcement on November \n20, 2016. The Plaintiffs counter there “is no evidence that any of the Plaintiffs engaged in any \nunlawful or threatening activity during the events in issue.” Doc. No. 275, p. 22. The Plaintiffs \ncontinue to argue the Backwater Bridge was not closed to pedestrians, the two “No Trespassing \non Bridge/No Trespassing” signs were not legal notice and did not provide notice to protestors that \nthe Bridge was closed, there was no other notice that the Bridge was closed to pedestrians, the \nBridge was located on unceded treaty lands, and it is genuinely disputed whether officers gave \nadequate announcements to give Plaintiffs notice that they were not allowed on the Bridge. See \nDoc. No. 275, pp. 22-30.  \n[¶169]  The Court has already discussed at length above the public notices from the DOT, the \nvideo and photographic evidence of the “No Trespassing on Bridge/No Trespassing” signs, and \nother evidence related to the question of whether the Bridge was open to pedestrians. While the \nCourt addressed this evidence above in the context of what a reasonable officer may perceive in \nthe context of an excessive force claim, the Court reaches a similar result here. Based upon the \nsame evidence, the undisputed evidence shows the area where the Plaintiffs allege they were \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 86 of 91\nengaged in First Amendment activity was closed to pedestrians due to the condition the Bridge \nwas in from the burned-out trucks. As a result, the Plaintiffs had no right to exercise their First \nAmendment rights in the area in question. “The First Amendment does not entitle a citizen to \ntrespass, block traffic, or create hazards for others.” Frye v. Police Dep't of Kansas City, Missouri, \n260 F. Supp. 2d 796, 799 (W.D. Mo. 2003), aff'd sub nom. Frye v. Kansas City Missouri Police \nDep't, 375 F.3d 785 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Wood v. Moss, 572 U.S. 744, 745 (2014) (“The \nfundamental right to speak, however, does not leave people at liberty to publicize their views \nwhenever and however and wherever they please.”).  \n[¶170]  Even if the Plaintiffs were able to adduce evidence to show a genuine dispute that they \nwere engaged in a lawful protected activity and the officers’ actions would chill a person of \nordinary  firmness from continuing in the activity, the Plaintiffs’ claim ultimately fails because \nthey have failed to provide evidence to create a genuine dispute that officers’ actions in using force \nwas in retaliation for exercising these rights. The Plaintiffs assert there is ample evidence to create \na genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the Defendants had a retaliatory animus. The Court \ndisagrees. The overwhelming undisputed evidence in the record could only lead a reasonable jury \nto conclude officers’ use of force was unrelated to the Plaintiffs’ exercise of any right and was \nrelated instead to a legitimate, government interest.  \n[¶171]  Just as in Bernini, a reasonable officer could have concluded the Plaintiffs were engaged \nin unlawful conduct and this was not protected activity under the First Amendment. See Bernini, \n665 F.3d at 1007 (“Although the protestors at the Shepard–Jackson intersection were engaged in \nprotected speech, members of the unit moved toward the police in a threatening manner and began \nto block traffic along a major roadway. A reasonable officer could conclude that this conduct \nviolated Minnesota law and was not protected speech.”). Much of the Plaintiffs’ discussion centers \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 87 of 91\non a situation where Plaintiffs and protestors were not violent or threatening and not committing \nany crimes; a situation the undisputed evidence shows is not present here. The evidence shows \nofficers’ using force against individuals on the Bridge – a place officers reasonably believed \nprotestors, including all named-Plaintiffs, were not lawfully allowed to be, despite the posting of \nsigns, warnings to vacate, and DOT releases. It further shows despite using force in attempt to \nremove protestors from the situation, protestors, including some of the named-Plaintiffs, returned \nto the Bridge, refusing to vacate the Bridge, and even doing pushes toward the barricade despite \nbeing subjected to less-lethal force. Additionally, while Plaintiffs assert only a few items were \nthrown at law enforcement and protestors were not threatening law enforcement, video footage \nshows at least 10 instances of protestors throwing live munitions back at law enforcement officers, \nprotestors cutting the concertina wire, and removing the burned-out dump-truck off the Bridge \nwith a semi and attempting to remove the second, among other instances. Law enforcement \nofficers issued two code-red alerts and a Signal 100 for immediate assistance – a first in North \nDakota history. This situation presented similarly in Bernini, and the district court in Bernini, \nwhich was affirmed, noted:  \nPlaintiffs admit that the crowd threw some rocks and at least one bag of feces. \nMoreover, the police at the intersection of Jackson and Shepard put in an urgent \ncall for back-up, showing that they feared that the protest was turning violent. \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish that the police were retaliating against them on \nthe basis of their speech, and they have therefore not established any violation of \ntheir constitutional rights. Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this \nclaim as well. \nBernini v. City of St. Paul, No. CIV. 09-2312 PAM/JJG, 2010 WL 4386888, at *5 (D. Minn. Oct. \n28, 2010), aff'd, 665 F.3d 997 (8th Cir. 2012).  \n[¶172]  The undisputed evidence forecloses any genuine dispute of material fact that officers’ \nmotivation to use force was due in part to the Plaintiffs’ exercise of their First Amendment Rights. \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 88 of 91\nBecause Plaintiffs have failed to establish any violation of their constitutional rights under this \nclaim, the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment and qualified immunity.  \ne.  MONELL CLAIMS  \n[¶173]  Plaintiffs also assert a Monell claim against the municipal Defendants. “A municipality \nmay be liable under § 1983 when an official municipal policy or custom caused a violation of a \nplaintiff's substantive due process rights.” Russell v. Hennepin Cty., 420 F.3d 841, 846 (8th Cir. \n2005). “Municipal officials who have final policymaking authority may, by their actions, subject \nthe government to Section 1983 liability.’” Id. (citing Angarita v. St. Louis County, 981 F.2d 1537, \n1546 (8th Cir.1992)). “Before a municipality can be held liable, however, there must be an \nunconstitutional act by a municipal employee.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n[¶174]  Plaintiffs also assert a Monell claim against Sheriffs Kaiser and Kirchmeier for failure to \ntrain, supervise, or discipline. “To state a claim under § 1983, the plaintiff must plead that a \ngovernment official has personally violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.” Jackson v. Nixon, \n747 F.3d 537, 543 (8th Cir. 2014). “While the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply to § \n1983 cases, a supervisor may still be liable under § 1983 if either his direct action or his ‘failure \nto properly supervise and train the offending employee’ caused the constitutional violation at \nissue.” Id. (emphasis added). “Even if a supervisor is not involved in day-to-day operations, his \npersonal involvement may be found if he is involved in ‘creating, applying, or interpreting a \npolicy’ that gives rise to unconstitutional conditions.” Id.  \n[¶175]  Because the Court has concluded no constitutional claims survive summary judgment, \nthe Plaintiffs’ Monell claims suffer the same fate. Defendants are therefore entitled to summary \njudgment on the Monell claims.  \n \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 89 of 91\nSTATE LAW CLAIMS  \n \n[¶176]  The Plaintiffs lodge assault and battery claims against the Defendants arguing,  \nDefendants willfully or recklessly caused each of the plaintiffs to suffer offensive \nharmful contact, serious bodily injury, and/or to have immediate apprehension of \noffensive harmful contact, severe bodily harm or bodily restraint, by shooting them \nwith munitions, spraying them with high pressure water, and/or launching and/or \nhurling chemical agent devices and grenades at them, or by causing the force to be \nused against them. \n \nDoc.  No.  129,  ¶170.  They  further  contend  the  acts  of  the  Defendants  were  unreasonable, \nconstituted excessive uses of force, and they did not consent to the force against them and were \ninjured by the same. Doc. No. 129, ¶¶172, 172.  \n[¶177]  The Plaintiffs also put forth a negligence claim against all Defendants, stating:  \nDefendants, and/or each of them, individually and/or while acting in concert with \none another, owed plaintiffs the duty to use reasonable care to avoid causing \nforeseeable injury and damage to plaintiffs during the events described in this \nComplaint The above-described acts and omissions of defendants breached the duty \nof care defendants owed to plaintiffs. \n \nIn doing the acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, defendants and/or each of \nthem, breached said duty to use reasonable care and said breach of duty caused, \nand/or contributed to the cause, of plaintiffs' injuries and damages as alleged in this \nComplaint. \nDoc. No. 129, ¶¶175-176.  \n \n[¶178]  Battery under North Dakota law occurs when an individual “(a) acts intending to cause a \nharmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or a third person, or an imminent \napprehension of such a contact, and (b) an offensive contact with the person of the other directly \nor indirectly results.” Wishnatsky v. Huey, 584 N.W.2d 859, 861 (N.D. Ct. App. 1998). Similarly, \nunder North Dakota law, a defendant commits assault if “he willfully causes bodily restraint or \nharm to another human being or places another human being in immediate apprehension of bodily \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 90 of 91\nrestraint or harm.” Binstock v. Fort Yates Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 4, 463 N.W.2d 837, 840 (N.D. 1990). \nIn either case, the act must be unjustifiable to constitute battery or assault. Id.   \n[¶179]  Pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-07.2, “[a]n individual who uses force as permitted under \nthis chapter is immune from civil liability for the use of the force to the individual against whom \nforce was used” unless the force was used against a law enforcement officer. “A person is justified \nin using force upon another person to defend himself against danger of imminent unlawful bodily \ninjury[.] N.D.C.C. § 12.1.-05-07.2. Force is also justified when used upon another person to defend \nanyone else so long as the person using force would have been justified in defending himself and \nthe person using force has not forfeited the right to self-defense by provocation or otherwise. \nN.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-04. “Force is justified if it is used to prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or \nother trespass in or upon premises, or to prevent an unlawful carrying away or damaging of \nproperty.” N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-06. However, a person cannot use “more force than is necessary \nand appropriate under the circumstances.” N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-07.  \n[¶180]  The Court has already determined the actions of officers in this case were objectively \nreasonable and they are entitled to qualified immunity on the Plaintiffs’ federal claims.9 For the \nsame reasons as heavily discussed in the excessive force claims, there exists no genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact to cut against a finding that officers here were clearly justified in using force to protect \nproperty, themselves, and others, and used reasonable care in doing so. See Raiche v. Pietroski, \n623 F.3d 30, 40 (1st Cir. 2010) (“Where a plaintiff alleges both a § 1983 excessive force claim and \ncommon law claims for assault and battery, our determination of the reasonableness of the force \nused under § 1983 controls our determination of the reasonableness of the force used under the \n \n9  Because  all  federal  claims  have  been  dismissed,  the  Court  likewise  dismisses  Plaintiffs’ \nDeclaratory Relief claim.  \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00406-DMT-ARS   Document 286   Filed 12/29/21   Page 91 of 91\ncommon law assault and battery claims.”). Accordingly, the Defendants are entitled to summary \njudgment on the Plaintiffs’ state law claims.  \nCONCLUSION \n[¶181]  Based upon the findings above, the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. \nNo. 135] is GRANTED.  \n[¶182]  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDATED December 29, 2021.      \n \n                         \n            Daniel M.
