    "summary": "<p>This Clearinghouse record deals with the federal defendant component of this complex public housing desegregation case. Filed in 1966, this part of the case ended in 1997--but the consolidated lawsuit against the Chicago Housing Authority is still ongoing as of 2022. In combination, the consolidated litigation is one of the most significant housing desegregation cases ever, leading to the nation's first desegregative housing mobility voucher program.</p>\r\n<p>In collaboration with BPI, the organization that represented the plaintiffs in this case, the Clearinghouse has acquired and posted the full litigation record -- over 2100 documents, all told. A handful \"core\" documents are set to display here; if you click on \"show more\" you'll see several dozen more. Hundreds more are displayed in the record for the <a href=\"../../../../case/11085/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">companion case</a>. The rest are archived in a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YWZoSWfVqQNvPa7e7fmnNWmEj5B6brzR?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">google folder</a>.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>On August 9, 1966, six Black tenants of Chicago public housing projects filed a class-action complaint against the Housing Assistance Administration, an agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This case was filed the same day as <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11085/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority</a></em>, in which the same plaintiffs alleged that the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) built public housing projects only in predominantly Black neighborhoods, resulting in further entrenchment of Chicago&rsquo;s segregated housing pattern. The plaintiffs alleged that this practice discriminated against them in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by physically isolating Black Chicagoans and inhibiting their access to social benefits&ndash;such as education&ndash;that were enjoyed by white Chicagoans. They also alleged discriminatory waiting list/leasing practices. In this case against HUD, the plaintiffs sought to also hold the federal government liable because HUD provided the CHA with funding for construction of housing. The plaintiffs alleged that the Department violated the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s Due Process Clause (which guarantees equal protection in federal government practices), as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, by funding CHA&rsquo;s racially discriminatory housing program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought to certify a class of approximately 43,000 Black Chicagoans who lived in or had applied to Chicago public housing. They wanted to enjoin the Department from making future federal funding available to the CHA that would be used to support racially discriminatory housing practices. When the case was filed, lead counsel Alex Polikoff appeared as a cooperating attorney for the ACLU--he soon joined Chicago's BPI (Business and Professional People for the Public Interest), which has provided plaintiffs' class representation to the present.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case against HUD was stayed on June 16, 1967. Judge Austin determined that the HUD and CHA cases raised identical issues and decided to litigate those issues in the case against the CHA without duplicating efforts in this case.</p>\r\n<p>After CHA lost on summary judgment, and a judgment order against it was entered in 1969, the stay was lifted in 1970. HUD promptly filed a motion to dismiss. Judge Austin granted HUD&rsquo;s motion on September 1, 1970. But the Seventh Circuit reversed this decision on September 10, 1971. 448 F.2d 731. The Court held that the equitable relief from the federal government might differ from the injunctive relief secured against CHA, and that the cases were meaningfully different. Therefore, adjudication of the case against the CHA did not moot the case against HUD. As to the merits, the Seventh Circuit held that HUD had violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. HUD's Secretary could be held liable for these violations because he played a significant role in the construction of Chicago public housing, the system which resulted from the federal funds was racially discriminatory, and the Secretary was aware of the racially discriminatory practices. The Seventh Circuit remanded the HUD case back to the district court to determine the appropriate equitable relief, but cautioned the district court against excessive interference with federal programs&ndash;the Seventh Circuit noted that a &ldquo;simple &lsquo;best efforts&rsquo; clause&rdquo; might be sufficient to remedy the wrongs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 11, 1971, the district court enjoined HUD from providing approximately $26,000,000 to the City of Chicago as part of the Model Cities Program, unless the City certified with the district court that 700 units had been identified and processed in a non-discriminatory manner. After the two cases were officially consolidated on November 26, 1971, the Seventh Circuit reversed this decision on March 8, 1972. 457 F.2d 124. The Seventh Circuit found that the Model Cities Program&ndash;which authorizes the HUD&nbsp; Secretary to provide federal funds to cities to benefit low-income people&ndash;was not tainted by the racially discriminatory practices exhibited by the City of Chicago. Although part of its funds went toward housing, the Model Cities Program was also intended to subsidize other social and educational programs for low-income families. Therefore, although the district court&rsquo;s efforts to force the City of Chicago to create additional housing in predominantly-white areas was &ldquo;laudable,&rdquo; the Seventh Circuit held that it was an abuse of discretion because the district court failed to consider the interest of other poor people who would be harmed by the withholding of these federal funds. The Seventh Circuit remanded the case back to the district court. The plaintiffs asked for a rehearing en banc, but this request was denied.</p>\r\n<p>Because the two cases were consolidated, all ensuing litigation is documented in the companion Clearinghouse entry, for <em><a href=\"../../../../case/11085/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>That includes the momentous Supreme Court case, which Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976), in which the Supreme Court found that HUD, unlike the suburban schools in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974) (the Detroit school desegregation case), had violated the Constitution and therefore a region-wide equitable remedy could be imposed against the federal agency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the consolidated action, in May 1997, HUD moved to terminate the consent decree that applied to it, because the decree's primary goal had been met: 7,100 public housing units had been created in predominantly-white areas. On August 26, 1997, Judge Aspen agreed that HUD&rsquo;s obligations under the consent decree had ended.</p>\r\n<p>The CHA part of the consolidated case, however, remains ongoing as of June 2022. (Again, see <a href=\"../../../../case/11085/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority</a> for post-1972 litigation.)</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is one of two consolidated class-action lawsuits that sought to remediate the effects of discriminatory housing policies in Chicago. This case alleged that the federal government was liable for providing funding that was used to perpetuate these discriminatory practices. The plaintiffs succeeded on holding the federal government liable, and over many decades fought to use federal funding to create public housing in areas that had been reserved for mostly white Chicagoans. This relief extended beyond the borders of Chicago into the surrounding metropolitan areas.",

Accordingly,  by  the  end  of \nthe  day  on  September  15,  1971,  sites  for  only  242  CHA \nunits  had  been  approved  by  the  City  Council as  against \nโSites  for  500  such  units  which  were  to  have  been  so  approved \nby  June  15,  3974,  ane  sites  for  an  additional  350  such \nunits  which  were  to  have  been  approved  by  September  15, \n1971,  under  the  Agreement. \n8.

To  deny  a  hearing  on-eueti  issue  would  be  to  deny  to. \nthis  Court  an  opportunity  to  consider  whether  appropriate \nrelief  in  this  case,  under  such  circumstances,  should  include \ninstructions  to  HUD  with  respect  to  the  timing  and  conditions \nfor  release  of  said  $26,000,000.  | \nll.  On  information  and  belief,  nearly  $8,000,000  of  | \ncities  funds,  exclusive  of  the  $26,000,000  here  in  question, \nare  presently  available  to  and  unused  by  the  City.  Accordingly, \nno  prejudice  would  result  from  a  delay  os  release  of  such \n$26,000,000  incident  to  a  hearing  on  this  motion.\n12,  Under  the  foregoing  circumstances  an  order  should \nbe  entered  by  this  Court  to  preserve  the  status  quo  with \nrespect  to  the  release  of  such  $26,000,000  pending  a  hearing \nwith  respect  to  such  matter.  Had  the  mandate  of  the  Court \nof  Appeals  already  issued,  a  hearing  as  to  such  matter  would \nclearly  be.  appropriate;  the  favtudieens  circumstance  that \nthe  possible  imminent  release  of  the  $26,000,000  may  occur \nprior  to  the  issuance  of  fimandate  should  iota  allowed \nto  present  this  Court  with  a  fait  accompli  and  nrdelude  it \nfrom  a  consideration  of  such  matter. \nWherefor,  plaintiffs  pray  for  an  order  to  be  entered  by \nthis  Court  to  preserve  the  status  quo  with  respect  to  the \nrelease  of  such  $26,000,000  pending  a  hearing,  at  a  time  to  be \nset  by  this  Court,  on  the  question  of  whether,  and  on  what \nconditions,  such  status  quo  should  be  preserved  pending  the \ncontinuation  of  the  appeal  of  this  cause. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nAlexander  Polikoff \nMilton  I.

The  agreement  was  made  possible  through  the  efforts  of  Geirae \nVavoulis  and  his  staff and Commissioner  of  the  Department  of  Development  and \nPlanning,  Lewis  Hill  and  his  staff.  .I  believe  that  this  program  represents  a  giant \nstep  towards  meeting  the  urgent  housing  needs  of  all  our  cHiena:  This  is  a \nprogram  of  the  highest  priority  for  the  city.\" \nUnder  the  agreement,  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority  will  begin,  after \napproval  by  the  City  Council,  acquisition  of  sites  for  500  units  by  June  15  in  | \naccordance  with  applicable  law  and  will  prepare  acquisition  of  sites  for  an  additional \n350  units  by  Sept.  15  of  this  year  and  sites  for  850  units  by  Dec.  15,  for  a  total \n  \nof  1790  units. \nseAffle 370  Form  i50  20M\naSe \nThe  Chicago  Housing  Authority  in  cooperation  with  the  Cook  Cc  danty  Housing \nAuthority  will  seek  to  establish  sites  for  230  low  cost  dwelling  units  in  10  suburban \nareas,  Plans  also  call  for  seeking  an  additional  270  units  in  the  area  outside \nChicago. \nThe  sereesneus  points  our  that  a  survey  of  the  sites  submitted  to  the  City \nCouncil  have  found  a  number  which  are  not  properly  zoned,  not  appropriate  for \nhousing,  or  have  been  acquired  for  other  public  and  private  uses.  Based  upon \nthis  information  it  is  expected  that  many  of  the  submitted  sites  will  not  be  satisfactory \nend  that  alternative  locations  will  have  to  be  cote \nThe  agreement  also  provides  that  housing  programs  undertaken  by  non-profit \norganizations  may  be  substituted  Fig  a  portion  of  the  other  programs.. \nOther  provisions  of  the  agreement  provide  that  the  city  and  other  agencies \nwhich  own  1000  scattered vacant  lots  will  use  them  for  single  family  or  town  โ \nunits  under  Section  235  of  the  Housing  Program.

In  addition  the  city  and  the  Department  of \nHousing  and  Urban  Development  will  require  developers  of  Section  236  Housing  to  make \navailable  20  per  cent  of  their  units  under  rent  supplement  contracis, \nThe  agreement  also  cites  long  range  developments  which  the  city  anticipates \nit  will  andertake  in  cooperation  with  other  agencies  to  provide  housirg  for  all  its  citizens. \n--the  use  of  a  number  of  sites  in  the  urban  area,  such  as  the  former  Bridewell \nFarm,  for  housing  developments  to  accomodate  moderate  and \n*\nlow  income  families. \n--the  use.of  choistete  and  deteriorated  commercial  strip \nfrontage  and  abandoned  or  vacant  factories  for  the  development  of  new  housing. \n--the  requirement  by  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopmenif  Hehe  ecco  fan  cred  funded  through  the  Dlinois  Housing \nDevelopment  Auth  ority  will  provide  10  per  cent  of  the  units  for  low  income \nfamilies. \n--development  of  new  towns  in  town  in  such  areas  as  Goose \nIsland,  the  railroad  yards  south  of  the  Loop,  obsolete  slips  and  lumber  yards \nalong  the  south  branch  of  the  Chicago  River  and  the  Lake  Calumet  vacant  land \narea.

The  mandate  of  the  Court  of Appeals  has  nqt  yet \nissued  and  in  normal  course,  pursuant  to  Rule  41  of  the  Rules \n\n,, \nof  Appel l at e  Procedure ,  will  not  i ssue  for  14  days  from  the \ndate  hereof.

The  Agreement \nalso  states  that  HUD  would  approve  the  second  year  model \ncities  program  of  the  City,  \"provided  that  the  City  by \nJune  15,  1971,  has  approved  sites  for  [such]  500  units,\"  and \nhas  made  r easonable  progres s  towar d  achieving  the  other \nobjectives  set  forth  in  the  Agreement . \n4.  On  June  15,  1971,  t he  City  advised  HUD  of  facts \nshowing  that sit es  for  only  242  such  CHA  units,  instead  of \nt he  500  provided  for  i n  t he  Agreement ,  had  been  so  pr ocessed \n, \n. \nby  June  15,  1971. \n5.  On  June  21,. 1971,  HUD  sent  a  l etter  t o  the  City  of \nChicago,  a  true  and  correct  copy  of which  i s  attached  heret o \nas  Exhibit D.  In  such  l etter HUD  stated  t hat  s ites  for \nonly  242,  i nstead .of  500,  such  units  had  been  approved  by  the \nCi ty  Counci l  as  of  June  15.  Nonetheless,  HUD  st ated  t hat  i t \nwould  approve  t he  City ' s  second  year  model  cities  program  and \nthe  conditional  r elease  of  $26,000,000  t herefor .  The  HUD \nletter  further  stated,  however,  that  such  model  cities  funds \nยท were  being  released  \"on  the  condition  that  the  City  Council \n~ \nwill  continue  to  approve  public  housing  sites  'suitable  for \nuse  by  CHA  in  accord \"\"'i th  applicable  l av,r'  at each  regular \nCouncil  session  . . .  Should  this  progress  not  continue  the  model \nci ties  l et t er of  credit will be  cancell~d. \" \n. 6.  Although  such  June  21  letter  speaks  in  terms  of  such \n,  -\n) \n-3-\n\nfunds  'being  released\"  on  the  aforesaid  condition,  HUD  had \nnot,  by  the  end  of  t he  day  on  September  15,  1971,  and,  on \nand  belief,  has  not  to  date,  r eleased  said \ninfo~rnation \n$26,000,000 . \n7.  Between  J  ne  21,  1971,  and  September  16,  1971, \nseveral  regular  sessions  of  t he  City  Council  were  held  but \nno  public  housing  sites were  aoproved  by  t he  City  Council \nat any  of  such  sess ions.  Accordingly,  by  the  end  of \nthe  day  on  September  15,  1971,  sites  for  only  242  CHA \n,  units  had  been  approved  by  the  City  Council as  against \nยท s\"tes  for  500  such  units  whi ch  were  to  have  been  so  approved \nby  June  15,  1971,  and  sites  for  an  addi tional  350  such \nunits  \"tโขir.ich  \"tvere  t o  have  been  approved  by  September  15, \n-\n1971,  under  the Agr eement. \n8.  On  information  and  belief,  not wi t hstanding  such \nfailure  by  the  City  Counci l  to  approve  a  substantial  part \nof  the  sites  needed  for  such  850  units  by  September  15, \n1971,  and  notwi thstandi ng  HUD' s  letter  of  June  21  stating \nthat  t he  model  ci t i es  funds  were  being  r eleased  upon  a \nconditio  ยท hich  has  not  been  met  and  that  ยทthe  model  cities \nletter of  credit  \"will  be  cancelled\"  if progress  did not \nconti nue  under  the Agr eement ,  HUD  intends  to  release  said \n--\n$26, 000,000  inuninentl y. \n9 .  The  Agreement  and  t he  HUD  of  June  21,  1971, \nlette~ \nreflect  a  determi nat ion  by  HUD  that  the  ab,il i t y  to  r equire  the \n... \n-4-\n\nCity  to  comply  with  its obligations  under  the  decree  in  the \ncompanion  case  (HUD  having  represent ed  to  the  Court  in  that \ncase  by  a  memorandum  filed  therein  that  it would  use  its \nbest  efforts  to  obtain  such  compliance)  is  reasonably \nrelated  to  other  programs,  i ncludi ng  the  model  cities program, \nover  which  HUD  exercises  control  as  to  the  release  of  funds. \nAccordingly,  such  exercise  of  control by  HUD  over  such \nrelease  of  funds  is  an  aspect  of  the  r elief in  t his  case \nwhich 'this  Court  will  have  the  responsibility  to  consider \nupon  remand. \n. \n10.  Under  the  foregoi ng  circumstances  plaintiffs  are \nentitled to  a  hearin9  on  the  question  of  whether  the  uncondi \ntional  release  of  such  $26,000,000  is  appropriate ,  or whether \nsuch  release  might  substantially  prejudice  t his  Court's \nability to  enforce  provisions  of  its decree  in  the  companion \ncase .  To  deny  a  hearing  on  such  issue  would  be  to  deny  to . \nthis  Cour t  an  opportunity  to  consider  whether  appropriate \nrelief  in  this  case,  under  such  circumstances,  should  include \ninstructions  t6  HUD with  r espect  to  t he  timing  and  conditions \nforยท release  of  said  $26, 000 , 000 . \n11.  On  information  and  belief,  nearly  $8,000,000  of  model \ncities  funds,  exclusive  of  the  $26,000 , 000  here  in  question, \nare  presently  available  to  and  unused  by  the  City.  Accordingly, \nno  prejudice would  result from  a  delay  in  release  of  such \n$26,000,000  incident  to  a  hear ing  on  this  motion. \n-5- ~ . \n\n12.  Under  the  f oregoing  circumstances  an  order  should \nbe  entered  by  this  Court  to  preserve  the ยทstatus  quo  with \nrespect  to  the  release  of  such  $26,000 , 000  pending  a  hearing \nwith respect  to  such  matter.  Had  the  mandate  of  the  Court \nof  Appeals  already  issued,  a  hearing  as  t o  such  matter  would \nclearly  be  appropriatei  t he  fortuitous  circumstance  that \nt he  possible  imminent  release  of  the  $26 , 000 , 000  may  occur \npri or  to  t he  issuance  of  the  mandate  should  not  be  allowed \nto  present  this  Court with  a  f ait accompli  and  pr eclude  it \nf r om  a  consi deration  of  such  m~tter. \nWherefor ,  pl ai nt iffs pr ay  for  an  order  to  be  entered  by \nthis  Court to  pr eser ve  the  status  quo  with  r espect  t o  the \nr elease  of  such  $26 ,000, 000  pending  a  heari ng,  at  a  time  to  be \nset by- t his  Court,  on  the  question  of whethe~and on  what \ncondi tions,  such  status  quo  should  be  preser ved  pending  the \ncontinuation of  the  appeal  of  this  cause. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nAlexander  Polikoff \nMilton  I .

Of\\! t:Y \nM.\\YOR \nFor. Immediate  Release \nMay 12,  1971 \nJ\\1ayor  Richard J.  Daley,  r egional administrator of the  Departm โขnt of \nHousing and Urban Development,  George VavouJis and Chicago Housing Authority \nchairman,  Charles Swibel ,_today annoL need an agreement providing increased )ow \nand rnoderate income housing opportunities in Chicago which \\Vill release federal \nfunds for the Model Cities and urban  renewal programs. \nThe new housing will be provided from a. variety of  Jrograms inc .uding \nr, \nthe participation of the Chicago Housing Authorit  non\"\"'profit community groups,  leasing \nanti rent certificates,  Chicago  Dw~llings Association.  use  of suburban sites and \nfederal housing programs  which provide subsidies  for low income families. \nMayor  Daley said,  \"This agree1ttent  will r 4eet the obj  ctives  of both the \ncity and the feder al government in providing good housing for low and moderate \nincome families.  The agreement was m ade possible through the  efforts  of George \nVavoulis and his staff and Co:mn'lissioner of the Department of Development  and \nPlanning,  Lewis  Hill and his  staif.  . I  believe that this progr am represents a  giant \nstep towards  meeting the urgent housing needs  of all our  citizens.  This is  a \nprogran  of the .b ยท.ghest priority for  the city. 0 \nUnder the agreement,  he Chicago Housing Aut  orHy w:i.ll begin,  after \napproval by the City CounciJ.  acquisition of sites  for 500  units by  June  ) 5 in \naccordance with applicable  law and will prepare acqu~sition of sites for an additional \n350 units by Sept.  15 of this year and sites for 850 units by Dec.  15)  for  a  total \nof 1700  units. \nยท~โข 370 form  i50  20M \n\n-2-\nThe Chicago Housing Authority in coopcr<:~tion with tlle Cook County Housing \nA ulhority will seek to establish sHes for 230 low cost dwelling units in 10  suburban \nareas.  Plans also call for seel ยทng an additional 270 units in the area outside \nChicago. \nThe agreement points our that a  survey of the sites submitted  to the CHy \nCouncil have fonnd a  number which  re not properly zoned,  not appropriate for \nhousing,  or have be  n acquired for other public and private uses.  Based upon \nthis inform<Jtion it is expected that many of the submitted sites will not be satisfactory \nand that n ltcrnative loc  tions will have to be selected. \nThe agreement also provides that housing progr<1rns undertaken by non-profit \nI \norganizations may be substituted for a portion of the other progrmns .. \nOther provisions of the agreement provide  that the city and other agencies \nvhich own 1000 scatt~rcd.vacant lots will  1se them for  siu.gle family or town house \nnits under Section 235 of  the Housing Program.  A  new leasing and rent  'eJยทtifica te \nprogram will be undertaken.with  up to $l1nillion of Model Cities money or  other federal \nfunds and  $1.  mi lion of community improvement  bond m oney to expand the  leasing \nprogram for housing low L'1come families.  In addition the city and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development  vill require developers of Section 236 Housing to inake \navailable ~0 per cent of t 1eir units tmder rent supplement contracts. \nThe agreement also cites long range developments which the city anticipates \nit will undertake in cooperatlon with other agencies to provide housir:g for all its citizens. \n--the use of a  number of sites in the  rba n  a  aa,  YGh  as the former Bridewell \nFarm,  for housing developments to acco  odate  moderate and \n\n-3-\nlow incorr:.e families. \n--the use. of obsolete and deteriorated commercial strip \nfrontage and a  andoned or vacant factories for the development of new housing. \n- the requirement by the Department of  Housing and Urban \nl1ยท\\t all developments \nD  velopmenv' iii 'lne metropolita1'l. area funded through the Illinois Housing \nDevelopment A u'\"h ority will provide 10 per cent of the  units for low income \nfamilies. \n--development of new to; ns in town i 1 such areas as Goose \nIsland,  the railroad yards south of the Loo  โข  obsolete slips and lumber yards \nalong the. south branch of the Chicago Hiver and the Lake Calumet :vacant land \narea.  These new communities would provide a  range of housing types and prices \nalong with necessary shopping _and  institutional facilities. \n- -use of land owned by the federal government such as \nFort Sheridan could be made  available for  housing. \n.. \n' \n\n,.  : \n: . \n\\~-โขโข ~I  .:.,,_.. .  :  :. r \n!1~11\\:.'\"(/ \n!~y~~ of  tho  Cl~~  Ctti. c:-t;::c~ \nCity 1! ;~ J.:i \n~ic~~o  Iilin~f~  GO~nl \n':n  f\\:\"{t  :J:~t  r\"')Cc~ยท~!) t  ~~;.~  )'\"0\\l:r,- lc~t(':~- ~- f  .,JI:,_:ยทp;~  l:l \\- \";{th  ,.. . _t:(:C.r;::~~~-\\-:.Y1~~ยทl!r: \nL1.2r><:~-r. t fJ  ~ !..\",tl:i.c.~J.ti1::ยท:  t.~-d)  Ctt:/ 1 ~.~  c:ffc::ctc:  to  t!c1~i(:tยท.,-t}  ~:~'~ l\\O~-f:~ t'i1g \n~.(J:.ยท.l~.:  fr(Jt  r~.:~:.71;'h  :~;~l  ti\\C  C;tt:;t-~-l~.~Jยทr~  ยทc.{;i;\\:(โขr r.~:  Xnt\\.r~ctc);~~  t1Ri:'-'\",;.j \n,ยท.. ., .,.  ; 2  'โข [โข'71 \n' lc.J  c.  . ,  1-7  ~ \nl\\.~~  :..rot.,  ;~!1t)~Jt  t~--(;  !ยทยทยท~;1..4;10~-;o .:tf  tJ-,;-.!  !. .. t..\"!-tt.t:~  t.,f  r!~.tn::-;~J:c,-n  \\f~~Ct  to r;,_;t \nfc,~ยท!:ยท~t  -.~:  ;.)Jt:~.  o{  rยท.(;t_:J~):'\\  t r;  fl'i?,)-:tยท:l;.~c!  !:.-, ~~{)!)  1;_~1J--:1. . \\1~t.'\".~7~C:  .!:.r;ttยท:;);-\\~-~  \\~ยท;ยท. . 1t:'J \nf:\"o  l ... ~,_;,_ _\\ t;,  t1~t) c:''( L~)tJ~:  ~ .. ~ L~5Nc:..  c_~; cยท:.~  ~ยทn  \\..h f.:  {.tty'::~  ~aA;:}~;J;r t) ~'\\  ~{;)..o:.:~=~ ~.0~ยท \nt\"<h~()t\\1\"'~.(:ยท(r  -:!o-;:  1(\",~J ... ยทi.l.~t~Oiยท:~::  !~l'~f\\ l\\:t(:;~.  f~Ut.'.~'l  t'\"G!,~(~1_(-,~\\  ::~<:~;:~t~ยท~l 1-~~~~)  (\">!~:\\.\"'-~-:-;ยท;i .. ; \n! \n:.~'\":CC.;J~:c::~.)'  i:O  rJ0::.ยท~,i1..:  ยฃ\\rrt:1u:.~~  ir-ยทt;>J.fโขC!\\:,-}\\!,:~1~-'lOr{  UJ~  ~{[1:)  fi~~ยทl1.ntยฃ;ยทd  1ยทยท~~\\)7,'!~<1-l:~)., \nI \nยทI \n,..J~' i.-. .,, .โข.   r..,- '.,ยท.:ยท.ยท/ ./  'l.1' li.F.I   .,.-,:-....-.\\โข.Jโข n_   u,. ,ยท tt, .. -& ..,..  ,.,. .....  lJ....-,......,..J..  .\"., .J \"'  r. , .'-. \\~.,..*..\",'A, โข..'. ..ยท.~~ ยท, )  i..ยท..

CHA]  \"  With  the  entry  of  an  order  on  teaant  assignment \nimminent,  the  companion  case  will  shortly be  disposed  of,  subject \nonly  to  the  Court's  continuing  jurisdiction.  Accordingly, \nplaintiffs  believe  it appropriate  to  r esume  proceedings  in  this \ncase  and  have  filed  their motion  for  summary  judgment  (and  certalt< \n\nrelated motions)  together  with  this  supporting  brief . \nIn  this brief we  review  the  status  of  the  case  (Part  I);  show \nhow  decisions  rendered  subsequent  to  the  filing  of  the  last briefs \nin  1967  have  made  it doubly  clear  that  the  pending  motion  to  dismiss \nthe  action  of  the  defendant  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Housing \nand  Urban  Development  (\"HUD\")  should  be  denied  (Part  II);  and  show \nwhy  plaintiffs'  motion  for  summary  judgment  should  be  granted \n(Part  III). \nI.  THE  STATUS  OF  THE  CASE. \nThe  complaint  in  this  case  was  filed  simultaneously  with  that \nin  the  companion  case,  Gaโข.1treaux  v .  CHA,  No.  66  C  1459.  The \nallegations  of  discrimination  in  the  two  complaints  are  identical. \nLiability of  HUD  is  p~edi::c.ted upon  its  being  a  \"joint participant\" \n(Burton  v.  Wilmington  Parking  Authority,  3G5  U.S.  715,  at  725)  in \nthat discrimination,  and  is based  on  t he  Fifth Anendment  to  the \nConstitution  (Count  I  of  the  Complaint) ,  as  well  as  upon  Section \n601  of  Title VI  of  the  Civi.l  Rights  Act  of  1964  (Count  II  of  the \nusc. \nComplaint;  42  ยง2000d). \nHUD  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  action  on  five  grounds: \n(1)  lack  of  standing  to  sue; \n(2)  failure  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies; \n-2-\n\n(3)  lack  of  jurisdiction; \n(4)  failure  to  state  a  claim  for  relief ~  and \n(5)  failure  to  join  an  indispensable  party. \nHUD  then  filed  three  briefs  and  several  affidavits  in  support \nof  its motion. *  Plaintiffs  filed  a  brief  in  opposition  plus  a \nmotion  (with  supporting  memorandum)  to  consolidate  this  and  the \ncompanion  case.  HUD  filed  a  reply  brief and  an  additional \naffidavit  and  plaintiffs  filed  a  motion  for  discovery  respecting \nthat affidavit.  Then,  on  its own  motion,  the  Court  entered \nits order of  June  19,  1967,  as \nfollows ~ \n\"Noting  that  the  substantive  issues  presented \nby  the  allegations  of  the  Complaint  here  are \nvirtually  identical with  those  presented  by \nthe  Complaint  in  the  companion  case  brought \nby  these  same  plaintiffs,  66  C  1459,  Gautreaux, \net  al.  v.  Chicago  Housing  Authority,  et al., \nand  that  the  determination of  those  issues \nmay  render  this  action  moot  or  greatly  facili \ntate  discovery  and  trial of  the  action , \nIT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that all proceedings \nherein  are  stayed  and  the  matter  continued \ngenerally  until  such  time  as  there  is  a  dis \nposition  of  the  companion  case  and  that all \npending motions  presently under  advisement \nshall  continue  under  advisement  until  such \ntime  as  it becomes  necessary  to  rule  thereon. \" \nThere  were  no  further  proceedings  until  the  filing of  plaintiffs' \n*Thus,  under  the  last sentence  of  Federal  Rule  12(b),  HUD's  motion \nis  to  be  treated  as  one  for  summary  judgment. \n-3-\n\nmotion  for  summary  judgment  and  this  supporting  brief. \nII .  HUD 'S  MOTION  TO  DISNISS  THE  ACTION  SHOULD  BE  DENIED . \nA  number  of  decisions  rendered  subsequent  to  the  filing  of \nbriefs  on  HUD 's  motion  to  dismiss  make  it doubly  clear  that  the \nmotion  must  be  denied.  For  convenience  we  will  set  forth  our  full \nargument  on  the  five  grounds  of  the  HUD  motion  here,  so  that  the \nCourt will  have  our  entire  argument  before  it in  a  single  document. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have  Standing  To  Sue. \nPlaintiffs have  standing  to  sue  on  two  separate  grounds  - under \nthe  Fifth Amendment  to  the  Constitution  (Count  I)  and  under  Section \n601  of Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  (Count  II). \n(1)  Plaintiffs  Have  Standing  Under  the  Fifth Amendment. \nCount  I  of  the  Complaint  charges,  in  effect,  that HUD's \ninvolvement  in  and  financing  of  public  housing  in  Chicago \nsegrega~ed \nhas  deprived  plaintiffs  of  the  equal  protection of  the  l aws,  i n \nviolation  of  the  due  process  clause  of  the  Fifth Amendment  to  the \nUnited  States  Constitution.  Bolling v.  Sharpe,  347  U.S.  497  (1954) . * \nIt is beyond  dispute  that  an  aggrieved  citizen may  sue  a  federal \n*In  Bolling,  the  original  school  desegregation  case  in  the  District \nof Columbia,  the  Supreme  Court  interpreted  the  due  process  clause \nof  the  Fifth Amendment  as  including  the  guarantee  of  equal  protection \nu.s.  u.s. \nof  the  laws .  347  at  499.  See  also,  Schneider v.  Rusk,  377 \n163,  168  (1964) \n0 \n-4-\n\nofficial  for  violation  of  his  rights  secured  by  the  federal \ncon~ \nstitution.  E.g. ,  Flast v.  Cohen,  392  U.S.  83  (1968)  Kent  v.  Dulles , \n357  U.S.  116  (1958) ;  Bolling  v .  Sharpe,  supra. \nHUD's  briefs  do  not  contest  this  proposition  but  argue  that, \n\"Plaintiffs  do  not  possess  the  personal  injury which  would  be \nrequired  for  any  constitutional  .. .  right  to  maintain  this  suit. \" \n(HUD's  first  brief,  p.7a. )  The  argument  is  supported  with \nquotations  from  taxpayer  cases  such  as  Frothingham  v.  Mellon,  262 \nU.S.  447  (1923) ,  to  the  effect  that,  \"(where  an  interest)  is \nshared  with  mil lions  of  others,  (it)  is  comparatively  minute  and \nindeterminable  ... \"  (HUD's  first brief,  p.8.) \nThe  answer  to  this  argument  and  these  cases  is  t hat,  unlike \nan  undifferentiated  class  of  taxpayers,  plaintiffs  do  possess \nthe  personal  injury,  i.e. ,  the  personal  stake  or  interest ,  required \nto  assert  the  constitutional  right  to  maintain  this  suit.  This \nCourt  has  succinctly  described  that  personal  interest in  the \ncompanion  case: \n\" [P]laintiffs,  as  present  and  future  users  of  the \n[public  housing]  system,  have  the  right  under  the \n.Fourteenth  Amendment  [here,  the  Fifth  Amendment] \nto  have  sites  selected  for  public  housing  projects \nwithout  regard  t o  the  racial  composition  of  either \nthe  surrounding  neighborhood  or  of  the  projects \nthemselves.  Possessing  this  right  and  being  of \nt he  opinion  that  it is  being  denied  them,  plaintiffs \n-5-\n\nmay  maintain  this  action  \"  Gautreaux  v.  CHA, \n265  F.Supp.  582,  583. \nMoreover,  Flast v.  Cohen,  decided  after  HUD's  briefs were \nfiled ,  carves  an  exception  out  of  the  Frothingham  doctrine  which \nis  plainly  applicable  to  the  plaintiffs .  In  Flast,  after  a  care-\nful  review  of  Frothingham ,  the  Supreme  Court  determined  that \nfederal  programs  may  be  attacked  on  constitutional  gr ounds  by \nparties who  have  ''the  personal  stake  and  interest  t hat  i~part t he \nnecessary  concrete  adverseness  to  [constitutional]  litigation \nFlast v .  Cohen,  392  U.S.  83,  101  (1968)  *  There  can  hardl y  be \neven  a  cavil  about  the  fact  that  the  interest o=  plai ntiffs \nmeets  the  \"concrete  adverseness11  test of  Flast.

Weaver,  294  F.Supp.  433, \n443  (N.D.  Cal .  1968). \n**This  is  a  separate  and  distinct ground  for  standing.  Standing  to \nsue  under  the  Fifth Amendment  does  not  depend  upon  finding  that \nplaintiffs  also  have  standing  under  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964 . \n-6-\n\nhas  been  in  violation  of  Section  601  of  Title  VI  of  the  Civil \nRights  Act  of  1964 .  (In  relevant  part  Section  601  provides  that \nno  person  shall  be  discriminated  against  on  racial  grounds  under \nany  program  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance .  42  U.S.C . \nยง2000d.}  HUD  asserts  that  plaintiffs  have  no  standing  to  sue  it \nfor  a  violation  of  that  section,  relying  principally on  Green \nStreet Assโขn  v.  Daley,  373  F.2d  1  (7th  Cir.  1967}.  (IIUD  concedes \nthat  \"under  some  circumstances\"  Section  601  may  \"give  standing  to \nprivate  persons  to  seek  relief  against  the  local  agency\"  (HUD's \nfirst brief,  p.25),  and  this  Court  has  so  held.  Gautreaux  v.  CHA \n265  F.Supp.  582,  583-84.) \n~he  language  of  the  Green  Street opinion  supports  HUD 1s  view. \n373  F.2d  at  8-9 .  However,  we  believe,  (1)  that Green  Street was \nin  error  in  this  respect,  as  do  several  courts  which  have  expressly \ndeclinf'4  to  follow  it;  (2)  that Green  Street is distinguishable  on \nits  facts;  and  (3)  that  in  any  event  the  later decision  of  the \nSupreme  Court  in Abbott~~b~~a~ories  v.  Gardner,  387  U.S.  136 \n(1967) ,  has  substantially undermined  Green  Street on  the  issue  of \nstanding.  Although  the  Court might  ordinarily  feel  bound  to  follow \nGreen  Street,  this  should  not  be  true  where  that case  has  been  so \nclearly undermined  by  a  later United  States  Supreme  Court  decision . \nThe  reasoning  in  Green  Street was  that  since  Sections  602 \n-7-\n\nand  603  of  Title  VI  provide  a  procedure  for  federal  officials  to \nfollow  if they  wish  to  cut  off  funds  to  recipients  who  violate \nSection  601,  direct  judicial action  for  Section  601  violations \nshould  not  be  permitted  lest  that  administrative  procedure  be  by-\npassed .  373  F. 2d  at  8-9 .  We  believe  this  conclusion  to  be \nerroneous  for  several  reasons : \nFirst,  courts  will  imply  judicial  power  to  enforce  federal \nstatutory  rights  absent  clear  and  convincing  evidence  of  a \ncontrary congressional  intent.  Although  Title  VI  of  the  1964  Civil \nRights  Act  does  not  specifically provide  for  suit by  persons  deni ed \nthe  rights  granted  in  Section  601,  it contains  no  such  clear  and \nconvincing  evidence  of  a  contrary  congressional  intent.* \n*An  example  of  such  \"clear  and  convincing  evidence\"is  contained  in \nSection  lO(b) (3)  of  the  Selective  Service  Act  of  1967 ,  50  U.S.C. \nApp.  4 6 0 (b) ( 3) : \n'' . .. No  judicial  review  shall  be  made  of  the  classifi \ncation  or  processing  of  any  registrant  by  local \nboards,  appeal  boards,  or  t he  President,  except  as  a \ndefense  to  a  criminal  prosecution  instituted  under \nSection  12  of  this  title,  after  the  registrant has \nresponded  either affirmatively  or  negatively  to  an \norder  to  report  for  induction,  ... \" \nSee  v.  Selective  Service  Board,  284  F.Supp .  749 ,  752-53 \n~reen \n(D.  Conn.  19 6 8) . \n-8-\n\nThe  most  recent  and  forceful  statement of  this  rule  is  in \nAbbott  Laboratories,  sustaining  judicial  review  of  actions  taken  by \nthe  Secretary of  Health,  Education  and  Welfare  and  the  Commissioner \nof  Food  and  Drugs.  The  Court  said  (387  U.S.  136,  139-41,  emphasis \nadded) : \n\" ... [A]  survey  of  our  cases  shows  that  judicial \nreview  of  a  final  agency  action  by  ar.  aggr~eved \nperson  will  not  be  cut off  unless  there  is \npersuasive  reason  to  believe  that  such  was  the \npurpose  of  Congress.  [citations  omitted]  Early \ncases  in which  this  type  of  judicial  review  was \nentertained,  e.g.,  Shields  v.  Utah  I d0ho  Central \nR.  Co._,  305  U.S.  177,  59  S.Ct.  :!..60,  83  L.Ed.  111; \nStark v.  Wic~ard,  321  U.S.  288 ,  64  S .Ct.  559,  88 \nL.Ed.  733,  have  been  reinforced  by  the  enactment \nof  the  Administrative  Procedu::::-e  Act ,  which  embodies \nthe  basic  presunlption  of  judicial  review  to  one \n'sufferi~g legal  wrong  because  of  agency  action, \nor  adversely  affected or  aggrieved  by  agency  action \nwithin  the  rr.eaning  of  a  relevant  r;tatute,'  5  U.S.C. \nยง70~ ,  so  long  as  no  statute  precludes  such  relief \nor  the  action  is  ::1:-.Jt  one  commi tt.ed  by  law  to  agency \ndiscretion,  5  U.S.C.  ยง70l(a).  The  Administrative \nProced'.lre  Act  provides  specifical.ly  not  only  for \nreview of  '[a] ge11cy  action made  revieยท.vable  by \nstatute'  but  also  for  review  of  'final  agency  action \nfor  whi ch  ew~e is no  c-i __ her  c..de<;n<>.te  :c.-~me(~Y  .i.n  a \ncourt,'  5  U.S.C.  ยง/04.  ~he l eu.i.sl ative  m2~erial \nel::u-::id::.U.ng  that  sr::lTtin<.\"l.:;_  act  mc:..:J..L:fests  a  cor.gress \nional  L1t.ention  tl1at  it.  cover  a  broad  spectrum  of \nadminisยทtrati ve  actions ,2  and  this  Court  has  echoed \nthat  theme  by  noting  that  the  Administrative \nProced~re Act's  'gener ous  review  provisions'  must \nbe  given  a  'hospitable'  interpretation.  [citations \nomitted.]  Again  in  Rusk  v.  Cort,  supra,  369  U.S.  at \n379-380,  82  s.ct.  at-r04 ,  the-Court  held  that only \nupon  a  showing  of  'clear and  convincing  eviden~of \n-9-\n\neffort to  employ  [plaintiffs']  administrative  remedy  would  be \n'futile' . 'ยท  (HUD  reply  brief,  p.S.)  The  exchange  of  letters  does \nshow  that  further  complaint  would  have  been  futile  (see  the  next \nsubsection  of  this  brief) ;  but  the  point  here  is  that  the  1965 \nexchange  of  letters constituted  an  exhaustion  of  the  supposed \nadministrative  remedy. \n(2)  Application  for  further  relief would  have  been  futile. \nThe  familiar  rule  is  that when  an  administrative  agency's \nannounced  views  or policies  are  such  that a  plaintiff's  application \nfor  administrative  relief would  almost  certainly be  rejected,  the \ncourts  will  not  require  the  plaintiff  to make  the  futile  gesture \nof  applying  to  the  agency  as  a  prerequisite  to  granting  judicial \nrelief .  See,  for  example,  School  Board  of  City  of  Charlottesville , \nVa.  v .  Allen,  240  F.2d  59 ,  63-64  (4th  Cir.  1956),  and  Koepke  v. \nFontecchio,  177  F.2d  125,  128  (9th  Cir .  1949) . \nHUD's  rejection  of  the  complaint  respecting  the  1965  sites \nplainly brings  this  case  within  that  rule,  particularly because  of \nthe  ground  for  rejection noted  above.  So  too  does  BUD's  action  in \napproving  1966  sites which  furthered  the  pattern of  segregation  still \nmore  (see  296  F.Supp.  at  911),  notwithstanding  HUD  had  the  1965 \ncomplaint  before  it.  Thus,  under  the  above  authorities ,  further \n-20-\n\ncomplaints  to  HOD  concerning  segregated  site  selection patterns  in \nChicago  were  not  required  as  a  prerequisite  to  seeking  judicial \nrelief.* \n(3)  In  the  circumstances  of  this  case  the  supposed  admin \nistrative  remedy  was  clearly  inadequate  and  resort  to \nit was  not  required. \nThe  supposed  administrative  remedy  is  not  really  an \nadministrative  remedy  at  all.  The  supposed  remedy  consists  of \na  regulation  which  says  that a  person  may  file  a  \"written \ncomplaint. \"  (The  regulation  is quoted  at page  19  of  HOD's  first \nbrief.)  There  is no  provision  for  a  hearing,  none  for  the  taking \nof  evidence,  none  requiring  HUD  to  take  any  action  at all based \nupon  the  \"complaint\"  -only to  \"investigate.\"  HOD's  argument \n*It may  also  be  noted  that,  as  the  opinion  in  Hicks  v.  Weaver \ndiscloses,  a  similar  letter of  complaint was  filed with  HUD \nin November,  1965  respecting  site  selections  in  Bogalusa, \nLouisiana.  The  complaint  was  rejected  in  June,  1966,  by  the \nsame  person  - t-1arie  C.  McGuire  who  rejected  the  complaint \nhere on  the  ground  that  the  Bogalusa  sites  were  in  racially \n1 \nmixed  neighborhoods.  HUD  was  asked  to,  and  said  it would, \nconsider  a  request  for  reconsideration  in  July  and  August, \n1966,  because  the  complainant  contended  that HUD's  facts  were \nwrong  and  that  the  proposed  sites were  not  in  racially mixed \nneighborhoods .  (August,  1966  was  the  month  the  complaint in \nthis  case  was  filed.)  HUD  never  communicated  thereafter with \nthe  complainant  and  he  learned of  HUD's  approval  of  the  Bogalusa \nsites  only  through  the  newspapers.  {  3c:l F.~\"tf .J 1:,.)\\.) \nThe  Court  found,  contrary  to  HUD' s  view  that  the sites were  in \nracially mixed  neighborhoods,  that  '~11 of  the  proposed  98  units \nwould  be  built in  the  Negro  sections  of  Bogalusa.\"  {id. ,  ~ ) \n~6. \n-21-\n\nappears  t o  be  that  if  a  government  agency  issues  a  regulation \nauthorizing  a  citizen  to  write  it a  letter of  complaint,  which  it \npromises  to  investigate,  it has  thereby  created  an  administrative \nremedy.  The  short answer  is  that  citizens  do  not  need  government \nagencies  t o  authorize  them  to  write  letters ,  and  such  purported \nauthorization  is  not  an  \"administrative  remedy\"  within  the \nmeaning  of  the  exhaustion  doctrine. \nMoreover,  by  the  time  the  HUD  regulation was  promulgated  a \ndecade  and  a  half of  discrimination  had  produced  a  nearly  all-Negro \nsegregated  housing  system  of  approximately  30,000  dwelling  units . \nWe  do  not  believe  that an  authorization  to  write  a  letter coupled \nwith  a  promise  to  investigate  constitutes  a  remedy  at all .  But \ncan  it seriously  be  asserted  that a  regulation  authorizing  citizens \nto  write  letters,  with  a  promise  to. investigate,  constituted  an \nadequate  administrative  remedy  for  that  situation?  The  rule  is \nthat ,  \"Exhaustion  is not  required when  the  administrative  remedies \nare  inadequate.\"  NLRB  v .  Shipbuilding Local,  391  U.S.  418,  426,  n. 8 \n(1968) ;  and  see  the  authorities  there  cited.  Cf .  Steele  v. \nLouisville  & Nashville  R.R.  Co .,  323  U.S.  192,  206  (1944) :  \"We \ncannot  say  that  a  hearing ?  if available,  before  either  of  these \ntribunals would  constitute  an  adequate  administrative  remedy .\"  We \nthink  it plain  that  no  adequate  administrative  remedy  has  been \n-22-\n\nprovided  for  remedying  the  existing  condition  of  an  all-Negro  public \nhousing  system  in  Chicago. \n*  *  *  * \nFor  these  three  separate  reasons,  the  exhaustion  of  adminis-\ntrative  remedies  doctrine  is  not  a  bar  to  Count  II. \nC.  The  Court  Has  Jurisdiction. \nHUD  asserts  that  the  Court  \"lacks  jurisdiction\"  over  this \naction.  (HUD's  first brief  23-25. )  It is  not  clear what  HUD \nmeans  by  this  assertion .*  Most of  the  argument  in  support  of  it \nconsists  of  the  same  standing  arguments  (citing  Harrison-Halsted \nand  Section  602  of  the  1964  Civil  Rights  Act)  we  have  already \ndisposed  of.  The  only  exception  is  one  paragraph  (p.23)  in which \nit is  said,  \"There  is no  specific  statutory  consent  t o  bring  an \naction  such  as  this  against  t he  defendant.\" \nThere  are  at  least  two  answers.  First,  as  has  been  observed  by \nthe  United  States  Attorney  General's  Committee  on  Administrative \nProcedure, \n*See  Norwalk  CORE ,  supra,  where  (HUD  being  one  of  the  defendants) \nthe  court said ~  \"It is  clear  that  the  District Court  has  subject \nmat ter  jurisdiction.\"  395  F.2d  at  926,  n.6. \n-23-\n\n\"While  the  Government  enjoys  sovereign  immunity  from \nsuit ,  its officers  do  not  share  in  that  immunity . \nThey  are  answerable,  as  private  individuals,  for \nwrongs  committed  even  in  the  course  of  their  official \nwork  โข..  To  be  sure,  the  officer may  justify his \nconduct  by  referring  to  the  law  under  which  he  is \nacting.  But  that  raises  precisely  the  issue  whether \nthe  law  does  indeed  authorize  his  conduct  under  the \ncircumstances  - the  typical  issue  for  judicial \ndetermination.\" \nAdministrative  Procedure  in  Government  Agencies, \nSoD6c.  No.  8,  77th  Cong. ,  1st Sess.  80-82  (1941); \nquoted  in  full  and  discussed  in  Byse,  Proposed \nReforms  in  Federal  \"Nonstatutory\"  Judicial  Review: \nSovereign  Immunity,  Indispensable  Parties,  Mandamus, \n75  Harv.L.  Rev.  1479,  1485  (1962). \nSecond,  Section  10  of  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  5  U.S .C, \nยง702,  \"implies  a  comprehensive  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity  in \nall  actions  otherwise  sustainable  against  federal  officers  or \nagencies .n  Powelton,  supra,  284  F.Supp.  at  834 . \nWhatever  HUD  may  mean,  these  authorities  as  well  as  the  cases \ndiscussed  under  standing  above,  involving  successful  suits  against \ngovernment  officers  and  agencies,  including  HUD,  show  plainly  that \ncourts  have  juri sdiction  over  actions  such  as  this  one . \nD.  Plaintiffs  Have  A  Claim  For  Relief. \nHUD  argues  that CHA,  not  it,  selects  sites ,  and  that  therefore \n\"plaintiffs'  real  controversy  is with  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority , \n-24-\n\nnot  the  Federal  Government.\"  (HUD;s  first  brief ,  p .27.) \nThe  argument  is  untenable.  It is  clear  that,  although  it does \nnot  make  the  initial  selection  of  sites,  HUD  is  deeply  involved  in \nevery  aspect  of  the  CHA  operation,  sets  the  site  selection  standards \nand  criteria with  which  CHA  must  comply,  and  has  and  exercises  the \npower  to  approve  or disapprove  every  site  selected by  CHA.  This  is \nacknowledged  in  HUD ' s  own  briefs,  as  the  following  material  shows: \n':In  practical  operation  of  the  low-rent  housing \nprogram,  the  existence  of  the  program  is entirely \ndependent  upon  continuing,  year  to  year,  Federal \nfinancial  assistance. \"  (HUD's  first  brief ,  p.S.)* \n\" .. .

'ยท  (HUD 's  first  supplemental  brief ,  p. 2. ) \nAn  inspection  of HUD's  \"Annual  Contributions  Contract\"  with \nCHA  (filed with  HUD's  first brief)  also  shows  the  detailed  role \nHUD  plays  in  CHA's  operations.

(See , \ne .g . ,  the  eight  pages  of  regulations  on  Site  Selection  and \nTentative  Site Approval  which  are  attached  to  HOD's  second \nsupplemental  brief. ) \nIt borders  on  the  ridiculous  to  argue  that  HUD,  upon  which  CHA \nis  \"entirely dependent\"  financially,  which  regulates  in  consummate \ndetail  almost  every  conceivable  aspect of  CHA's  operationsi  which \nestablishes  site selection  criteria  for  CHA,  which  has  among  its \nmany  other  powers  the  power  to  approve  or  disapprove  (tentatively \nand  finally)  CHA's  site  selections,  and  which  in  fact  exercises  that \npower  and  \"negotiates\"  such  approval  or  disapproval,  has  no  funct ion \n-28-\n\nto  perform  i n  connecti on  with CHA's  site sel ect ions  and  is  therefore \nnot  subject  to  suit  i f  CHA's  site  selection practices  are  racially \ndiscri minatory. \nIn  Hicks,  supra,  the  court  said  in  language  equally  applicable \nhere ; \n\"Likewi se,  through  its Secretary Weaver ,  HUD  has \nviolat ed  t he  plai ntiffs'  rights  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง2000d. \nAs  not ed  above,  HUD  was  not  only  aware  of  t he \nsituati on  i n  Bogalusa  but  it effectively  directed \nand  controlled  each  and  every  step  i n  the  program. \nNothing  coul d  be  done  without  its approval .

There,  it will  be  recalled,  a \nstate  agency  sought  to  insulate  itself  from  the  discriminatory \npractices  of  a  restaurant  lessee  on  the  ground  that  it had  not \npurported  to  dictate  to  the  lessee  how  to  run  its  restaurant \nbusiness.  (150  A.2d  197 ,  at  198.)  Although  the  relationship \nbetween  the  state  and  the  lessee was  not  in  any  respect  as  close \nas  that  between  CHA  and  HUD,  the  Supreme  Court  said: \n\"The  State has  so  far  insinuated  itself into \na  position  of  interdependence  with  [the \nrestaurant  lessee]  that  it must  be  recognized \nas  a  joint participant in  the  challenged \nu.s . \nactivity  ...  365  at  725 . \n:~ \nSee  also  Cooper  V o  Aaron,  358  U.S.  l,  4  (1948),  to  the  effect \nthat  a  governmental  agency  may  be  sued  for  discrimination  if it \nparticipates  in  the  activity  complained  of  \"through  any  arrangement, \nmanagement,  funds  or  property,\"  and  Colon  v.

An  Order  Against  HUD  is Necessary  to  Give  Plaintiffs  the  Full \nRelief  to  Hhich  They  are  Entitled. \nThis  Court  has  held  that plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  the \nformulation  of  a  comprehensive  plan  to  remedy  the  past  effects  of \nunconstitutional  site  sel ection  in Chicago's  public  housing  program. \n265  F.Supp.  at 914.  This  is  consistent with  the  view  expressed  by \nthe  Supreme  Court  in  considering  a  decree  designed  to  remedy  the \npast  effects  of  voting  discrimination: \n,, \nthe  court  has  not  merely  the  power  but  the  duty \nto  render  a  decree  which  will  so  far  as  possible \neliminate  the  discriminatory effects  of  the  past  as \nwell  as  bar  like discrimination  in  the  future.ยท' \nLouisiana  v.  U.S.,  380  U.S.  145,  154  (1965) . \nIt is  of  course  impractical  to  relocate  buildings  already \nerected.  The  Court's  judgment  order  in  the  companion  case  accord-\ningly  provides  for  remedying  the  past  by  prescribing  the  location \nof  future  housing  units.  Thus,  the  extent  and  swiftness  of  the \nremedy  will  depend  upon  how  many  and  how  rapidly  housing  units  are \nsupplied  in  the  future.  The  Court ' s  order  recognizes  this  by \ndirecting  that, \n\"CHA  shall  use  its best efforts  to  increase  the \nsupply  of  Dwelling  Units  as  rapidly  as  possible \nand  shall  taxe  all  steps  necessary  to  that \nend  . .. \"  (Subsection  A  of  Article  VIII.) \nThe  Court  and  the  class  represented  by  the  plaintiffs  therefore  have \na  keen  interest in  the  factors  affecting  the  future  production  and \n- 34-\n\nsupply,  not  just  the  location ,  of  D\\,relling  Units . \nA  second  major  element  of  truly  effective  re lief  will be  the \nability  to  utilize  areas  beyond  the  geographic  boundaries  of  the \nCity  of  Chicago.

Such submissions by  Local \nAuthorities may be made  to the  Project  Planner and Land Adviser  for inclu \nsion ln their report.  (See  paragraph 7b  below.)  The  advice and assistance \nof the Regional  Office are available  to  Local Authorities in respect to the \nselectlon of sites under  the special conditions  and  considerations  pertaining \nto any  particular case. \n5.  Poljcy  on  Purchase  of  Excess  Land \na.  No  cost for  land in excess  of that required in connectlon with the con \nstruction of the  project  (including dwelling and nondwelling facilities  and \nplaygrounds) may  be  included in the developnent  cost of a  project except \nwhere  the site consists  of  one  parcel  (or includes  a  large parcel) with an \narea in excess  of that required for the development  of the project and where \nthe severance  damage  involved in purchasing only the  land required for  the \nproject would  exceed the cost  of the  excess  land.  Cost  of acquiring land \nfor  development  of future projects may  not be included in the  development \ncost of a  project. \nb.  If existing circumstances  should  justify approval of the purchase  of \nexcess  land to obtain a  site,  the Annual  Contributions  Contract  requires \nthat the excess  real property be sold as  soon as  practicable at public sale \nfor not  less  than the fair value thereof,  unless  other disposition or \nmethod  of disposition is approved.  The  project shall be so planned as  to \nprovide adequate  access  to the excess  land in order that it may  be sold. \nc.  In cases  where  the excess  land is unsuitable  for improvement because \nit is unbuildable or inaccessible,  or for  other reasons,  IDeal  Authorities \nare urged to give full consideration  to the disposition of the property \nto eUgible public bodies  under  the Open-Space  Land  Program  administered \nby the Renewal  Assistance  Administration.  Details  of the program  may  be \nobtained from  the office of the Regional Administrator. \n(Cont 'd) \nNOTE:  These  pages  7-8  supersede pages  7-8  of Section 205.1 dated September  1965. \n- - -Pa-ra-gra-ph- 4-g -ha-s -be-en- a-m-p-lif-ie-d. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- 7 -\n\nHUD \nHAA \n205.1  :U::W-RENT  HOffiiNG 11ANUAL  February 1967 \n- - -\n..  - - -\n6.

A site containing any  property belonging to another public \nor quasi-public boQy  or institution will not be  approved until the  Local \nAuthority,  after conferring with responsible persons,  obtains written assurance \ntram such  or institution that such property may  be  acquired by amicable \nb~ \nnegotiation at a  cost not in excess  of its fair value. \n1.  Procedure for Site Selection and Tentative Approval \na.  Selection by  Iooal Authority and  Inspection by Regional  Qf'fice.  Having \nreaclied its conclusions as  to a  sUitable  site, the  LOCal  Authority shall \nrequest the Regional  Office to eend appropriate personnel to inspect the \nproposed site and to consider all of the reasons  advanced for the  Local \nAuthority's selection. \nb.  Tentative Site Approval.  After inspecting the proposed site, the \nProject Planner and the  land Adviser will prepare a  report which will be \nsubmitted to the  Assistant Regional Administrator !or Housing Assistance. \nThe  Iooal Authority shall furnish to the  Project  Planner and the Land \nAdviser,  for inclusion in their report,  such material as may  be  required \nto support their conclusions,  including such supporting data or information \nas may be required to enable  the Regional  Office to include,  in its tenta \ntive approval of the site selected by  the  Local Authority,  a  specific \ndetermination that the selection is in accordance with HUD  policy established \nunder  Title VI  of the  Civil Rights  Act  of 1964  (see Exhibit  2,  Low-Rent \nHous  Manual  Section 102.1).  If the  report is favorable and if the \nAssistant Regiona  amlnistrator agrees with the recommendations  contained \nin the report,  he  will,  by letter, give tentative approval  of the site, \nwhereupon  the Local Authority may  proceed with completion of the  Development \nProgram  (see Section 206.)) based upon  use  of the site proposed.  The  term \napproval\" means  merely that the Regional  Office and the  Local \nยท~entative \nAuthority have  agreed on  the site to be presented in the  Develo}:lllent  Program; \nsuch tentative approval does  not in any way  bind HUD  to give final  approval \nto the site. \n- -- - -- - ---- - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - -- - - --- -\n~  ~  ~  ~ \n- 8 - HUD-HAA,  Wash.,  D.C. \n\nยท~ \nPHA \nSeptember 1965  LOW-RENT  HOUSING MANUAL  205.1 \nSite Selection and Tentative Site Approval \nl.  General.  This Section sets  forth the  criteria to be used in judging the \nsuitability of proposed sites  for  low-rent housing and  the  procedure  for \nobtaining tentative PHA  approval  of proposed sites.  Special cases  are \noutlined,  involving urban renewal  sites and the use  of existing buildings. \n2.  Redevelopment  and  Conservation  Programs \na.  Relocation \n(1)  If the  Local Authority proposes  to acquire  a  site in an  urban \nrenewal area,  or outside  the  area,  for the  purpose  of relocating resi \ndents,  there  are  several special considerations.  The  interdependence \nof housing and urban renewal is frequently the key to the  success  or \nfailure  of a  city's redevelopment  efforts. \n(2)  Joint agreements between  the  FHA  and the Urban  Renewal  Administra \ntion are  in effect to  coordinate  their respective  activities.  If PHA \naided housing is a  necessary resource  for  the relocation of urban \nrenewal  site occupants,  coordinated time  schedules  for  development will \ngenerally be  required.  Advice  should be  obtained from  the  PHA  Regional \nOffice. \nb.  Conservation Areas \n(1)  The  rehabilitation of existing housing structures  and the  construc \ntion of new  dwellings  in conservation  areas  are expected to become \nincreasingly important.  In addition  to  the responsibility of the  Local \nAuthority for  providing  low-rent pubLic  housing,  the  local administration \nand  development  of  conservation programs may  involve many  organizations, \nsuch as  city governments,  local public  agencies,  and private and  non \nprofit agencies,  as  well as  individual property owners. \n(2)  The  FHA  Project Planner and Land Adviser are available  to assist \nthe  Local Authority in providing PHA-aided  housing in conservation areas. \nGenerally,  such projects will require  special handling with regard to \nsite  approval and valuation of buildings. \nc.  Land  Price.  Section  107 of the  Housing Act  of  1949,  as  amended,  pre \nscribes the price to be  charged the  Local Authority for  land which  is part \nof  an urban renewal project.  The  PHA  Land  Adviser  is expected to serve as \na  liaison officer with local  and  Federal urban  renewal  agencies  concerning \nland acquisition procedures  and  agreements. \n(Cont'd) \nNOTE:  This  Section supersedes  Section 205.1 pages  variously dated.

Available Properties  in Which  the United  States  Has  an  Interest \na.  In cases where  properties  owned  by the  United States  or  in which t he \nFederal Government  has  an interest are available in the  locality,  the  Local \nAuthority shall give  full  consideration to  their use  for  the  low-rent  pro \ngram.  (As  used in this paragraph,  \"properties\"  refers  to buildings  which \ncould be used  for  low-rent  housing.)  The  feasibility of using  available \nFHA  and VA  properties  shall be  considered  from  the date  Program  Reservation \nfor housing has been approved by the  FHA  until  the Regional  Director approves \nthe Initial Request  for  Land  Purchase  Approval .  (See  Section  205.2.) \nb.  The  FHA  Project Planner  and  Land Adviser are available  for  consultation \nand for  liaison with the  Federal Housing Administration,  Veterans Adminis \ntration,  and other Federal agencies. \nc.  Before tentative site approval is given by the  PHA,  all such  properties \nwhich the Local Authority wishes  to include  in its  program will be  inspected \nby the Project Planner and  Land Adviser .  (See paraยงraph 7a  below.) \n4.  Criteria for  Site Selection \na.  General.  considerations  involved in site  select ion include: \n1~e \n(J)  The  sui.tability of the  \"'ite in relation to the  surrounding neizh \nborhood and  the  city plan. \n(2)  The  physical characteristics of the  site,  which  should be of a \nnature  to permit an orderly and  appropriate  arrangement of the \nproposed number  and type  of units and  should make  economical \nconstruction and management  costs possible. \n(3)  The  cost of the  site itself and  of the  required site  improvements. \n(~)  In the  case  of slum  sites,  the  feasibility of relocating the  site \noccupants without undue  hardship. \n(5)  The  suitability of the  site from  the  standpoint  of facilitating \nand furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions  of \nTitle VI  of the  Civil Rights Act  of 1964  and  agency regulat ions \nand requirements  issued pursuant thereto  (and  of Executive  Order \nllo63,  with respect to  creed). \nb.  Single Sites Versus  Scattered Sites \n(1)  Nothing  in this Section shall be  construed  as  requ~r1ng that the \nsite for  a  project must  consist of one  large parcel  or  an  assembly of \nparcels.  A single project may be  located on  one  or  more  relatively \nlarge  sites;  or  scattered sites  (each accommodating one  or more  dwell \nings) may  be  used. \n(Cont'd) \n- 2  -\n\nmm. \nPHA \nSeptember  1965  LOW-RENT  HOUSING  MANUAL  205.1 \n(2)  In  selecting sites,  due  consideration should be  given  to any  fea \ntures  of neighborhood renewal proposals whjch might influence  the  choice \nor affect  suitable planning and  economic  development  of the  individual \nsites.  Scattered sites should not be  chosen  if  a  decent  standard of \nlivability in  the proposed housing is not possible because  of inter \nmingled neighborhood blight,  unless  reasonable  steps  are taken  through \nurban  renewal or other proper means  to ensure  rehabilitation of the \nneighborhood. \nc.  Suitability in  Relation to Surrounding  Neighborhood  and  City Plan \n(1)  The  site shall be  chosen with due  regard for  and  consistency with \nlocal plans  for  long-range  city plans  and  related development  and  slum \nclearance  and urban  renewal proposals which  would  control or  influence \nthe  site location. \n(2)  The  site shall be  located 'IThere  zoning laws  protect it s  residen \ntial charact er,  or  agreements  for  obtaining  such protection through \namendment  of existing requirements must  be made  in  advance.  This  re \nquirement  shall not be  construed as  prohibiting  the  location of a \nproject in the  general proximity of business,  manufacturing,  or  industry, \nbut is intended to ensure that the project and its immediate environment \nare reasonably free  from  danger  of adverse  effect by nonresidential  land \n(3)  The  site shall be  well related to public  transportation,  public \nschools,  shopping,  and all other facilities  necessary to the  health, \nsafety,  and general welfare of the tenants. \n(4)  In addition to appropriate population density,  due  consideration \nshall be  given to l ocal regulations regarding off-street parking.  Accessi \nbility and adequacy of existing neighborhood playgrounds  require  careful \nappraisal,  as  the presence  or lack of these  facilities may  materially \naffect the  size of the  site to be  acquired.  Also,  where  sub-surface \nsewage  disposal is  planned,  the  site shall be  of runple  size  for  disposal \nfields  plus  sufficient  space  for  100 percent expansion. \n(5)  Systems  of water  and sewerage,  electricity,  and other utilities \navailable to the community must  also be  available to the  project site \nat reasonable  cost.  When  water and  sewerage  are  not  so available to \nthe project,  water  supply and sewage  disposal  systems  provided and \noperated by the project will be permitted on condition  that an  adequate \nsupply of potable water  can be made  obtainable without excessive  cost, \nand  provided  that the  proposed method  of sewage  disposal is feasible, \nis economical  in initial and  operating cost, and  will not result in \nactual or possible contamination  of any water  supply or involve  a \nnuisance  of any kind. \n(Cont'd) \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- 3  -\n\n'Htfti'A \nPHA . \n205.1  LOW-RENT HOUSING MANUAL  September 1965 \n(6)  In the  standard form  of Cooperation Agreement,  the  city agrees  to \ngrade and pave  boundary and necessary access  streets and to provide or \ncause to be provided water mains  and  storm and sanitary sewers  leading \nto and serving the bounding streets of the  project.  In each case the \nLocal Authority agrees  to pay to the  city such  amount  as  would be \nassessed against the project site for  such work  if the  site were  pri \nvately owned.  If  any substantial amount  of such work will be required, \nthe  Local Authority should,  at the time  of preliminary site selection, \nadvise the  city by letter of the  approximate  extent and type  of facili \nties which the  city will need  to provide  for  the  site pursuant to the \nterms  of the Cooperation Agreement.  If any substantial extensions  of \nelectric lines or gas  mains  will be  necessary,  at least verbal assurance \nmust  be  obtained from  responsible officials that  such facilities will \nbe  provided and that the  Local Authority will not be  charged for  any \ncosts which would not be  charged to a  private owner. \n(7)  No  project  shall be  located where  it  would be  subject to serious \nand  chronic  nuisances  such as  smoke,  fumes,  odors,  or open  sewerage. \nSo  far  as  local choice will reasonably permit,  sites near or  adjacent \nto railroads,  waterways,  expressways,  airports,  and  similar hazards \nshall be  avoided. \nd.  Physical Characteristics.  No  site shall be  selected where  topographic \nor  su.bsmยทface  condiLlons prevent.  econonucal and well-planned development  anu \noperation of the project. \n(1)  As  a  general  rule any  site vdth dominant  grades  in excess  of 10 \npercent involves  costly development  and management  expense  and  shall not \nbe  selected unless  adequate  advance  planning studies demonstrate  the \nfeasible  and economic  use  of such a  site.  Conversely,  a  low-lying  and \nrelatively flat site shall not be  selected unless  it is susceptible to \npractical and economical means  of quick and  complete  disposal of surface \nwater under  normally expected heavy  rainfall.  Where  the  topography \nobviously is such that  feasible use  of'  the  site is subject to question, \ntoposraphic information should be  sought  from  available  sources  such as \nthe  U.S.  Geological Survey maps  and the  local City Engineer's office. \nIn cases  of rugged topography it will be necessary,  prior to tentative \nsite approval,  to have  some  preliminary surveys  and dravTings  made  to \ndemonstrate  the  feasibility of'  the  site. \n(2)  Where  septic tanks  and  subsurface  sewage  disposal are to be  em \nployed,  the  site should slope downward  away  from  existing or proposed \nstreets to permit disposal  fields  near the  surface  (18-36  inches  in \ndepth)  and in rear-yard areas.  Appropriate  subsurface  investigation \nshall be made  to determine  that  (a)  the percolation rate is satis \nfactory for  this type  of sewage  disposal;  (b)  rock formations  or other \nimpervious  strata are at a  depth greater than six feet below the \n~round \n-- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (Contโขd) \n- 4-\n\n-HfHo1A \nPHA \nSeptember 1965  LOW*RENT  HOUSING  MANUAL  205.1 \nยทsurface;  and  (c)  the  maximum  elevation of  the  ground-water  table is at \nleast four  feet below the ground surface.  Unless  these conditions are \nsatisfied the  site is unsuitable for  a  subsurface  sewage-disposal system, \nexcept  in certain localities where  State or local authorities may  grant \napproval under special conditions. \n(3)  Sites located where  there  is any evidence of unsuitable bearing \nqualities for foundation and  underground utilities or  of excessive \nareas  of rock  to be  excavated shall not be  selected unless  and  until \nit is demonstrated  that the  site is,  in fact,  subject to proper and \neconomical development.  As  a  rule,  careful inquiry will disclose \ninformation at least as  to the  general conditions which  may  be  expected \n(see Bulletin No.  LR-2,  Subsurface  Soil  Investigation).  If such  inquiry \npoints to the need for more  specific  information,  the  Local Authority \nshould  obtain sufficient test borings and/or  pits to determine within \nreasonable limits whether  the  subsurface  conditions will permit \necono~ \nical development  of the  site.  In case  of  doubtful  subsurface  conditions, \ntentative site approval will not be  given until such  tests have  been made \nand  have  indicated acceptable  conditions. \n(4)  No  site shall be  selected where  there  is susp1c1on  of  potential \ndanger  of  earth slides either on  the  site itself or on  adjacent or nearby \nland until it has  been  conclusively established that such danger  is non \nexistent.  This  injunction must  take  into  consideration the  fact  that \nin hilly \"terrain  ex1sting  ~:~oil cond1tions  may  be  sยท.:.d.bltJ  if  uno.lst.uro  .! \nbut may  tend to move  because  of grading  operations.  Expert consulting \nservices will be  required in such cases prior to tentative  site approval. \n(5)  No  project shall be  located where  it would  be  subject  to flooding. \nWhere  there  is even  a  suspicion of  such potential hazard the  conditions \nmust  be  thoroughly investigated and  authoritative opinion obtained before \ntentative site approval will be  given. \ne.  Acquisition Cost \n(l)  The  cost of acquiring the  site should bear a  reasonable  relationship \nto  total development  cost.  While  a  higher  cost can be  justified for a \nslum  site than  for a  vacant  site,  the  coats of acquiring  the  most  densely \ndeveloped slum areas are usually greater than can be  justified for  low \nrent housing projects. \n(2)  In no  event shall parcels  or blocks  that are conspicuously expen \nsive in comparison with  the remainder of a  site be  included within the \nsite boundary merely to facilitate  the planning  of  a  symmetrical  proj \nect or for  other  similar reasons.  Whenever  possible,  such  parcels must \n(Cont'd) \n- - - - -\n- 5 -\n\nt1~ \nPHA \n205.1  LOW-RENT  HOUSING  MANUAL  September 1965 \nbe  omitted as  exceptions  to  the proposed taking.  The  provisions  in para \ngraph 4b  above,  relative to planning projects  in sections  or  on  scattered \nsites,  should be  given consideration in connection with  this question. \n(3)  No  improved  site which  includes  any  substantial number  of dwellings \nwhich are not substandard shall be  selected. \n(4)  No  improved  site shall be  selected if such  site includes any  sub \nstantial number  of dwellings which  are substandard but which  may  be \nrehabilitated at modest  cost,  unless  most  of such dwellings  are to be \nrehabilitated and  included  in the low-rent project. \n(5)  Special care  should be  taken to ensure  that the estimate  of cost \nof acquiring  the proposed site is a  realistic one.  The  estimate  shall \nbe made  on a  parcel-by-parcel basis.  The  Local Authority should uti \nlize the best information and advice  available  from  public  records,  pre \nvious  experience,  revenue-producing  capacity of the  properties  compris \ning the  proposed  site,  and  opinions expressed by real estate brokers \nwt1o  have  knowledge  of recent  sales prices  or asking prices for prop \nerties comparable  to those  comprising the  site.  The  estimate and  the \ninformation upon which  it is based  shall be  discussed fully with  the  PHA \nLand  Adviser  (see paragraph  7a  below)  in order that there  sho11  be  mutual \nagreement between the  Local Authority and  the  PHA  that tha  estimate of \nsH,f'  ~cquisit.ion cost.  j s  a  VAlid  and  realistj c  one. \nf.  Feasibility of Relocation.  No  improved  site will be  approved  by the PHA \nuntil there has  been  submitted a  feasible  and  satisfactory plan demonstrating \nthat the  site occupants to be  displaced  can be  relocated without undue  hard \nships to  such occupants  (see Section  209.1). \ng.

ROMNEY, \nDefendant-Appellee. \nOn  Appeal  from  the  Judgment  of  the  United States \nDistrict Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  Illinois \nREPLY  BRIEF \nThe  opinion  below  rested  on  three  grounds:  (l)  Count  I \nof  t.hc  compJ aint_  wa<  dismissed  for  lack  of  jud sdj ction;  (2) \nCount  II  of  the  complajnt was  dismissed  for  failยทrc  to  slate \na  claim upon  which  relief  coulcl  be  granted;  and1 (3)  both  count.s \nwere  dismissed  because  of  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity. \nHUD  does  not  respond  to  the  discus sion  in our  initial  brief  of \n\nthe  first  and  third  grounds,  and  presumably  abandons  them  as \nreasons  for  affirmance.  The  second  ground  is  dealt with  in \nPart  II  of  BUD's  brief ,  and  a  mootness  argument,  not  relied \nupon  in  the  opinion  below,  is  advanced  in  Part  I. \nWe  will  first  reply  to  HUD ' s  discussion  of  the  second \nground,  the  liability  issue,  and  then  deal  with  the  new \nmootness  argument.  Nothing  further  is  added  here  to  what  we \nsaid  in  our  initial brief  about  the  two  grounds  HUD  has \npresumably  ahandoned. \nI.  A  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF  AGAINST \nHUD  HAS  BEEN  ESTABLISHED. \nHUD  says,  \"Plaintiffs  argue,  in  essence,  that  because \nHUDis  efforts  to  end  CHA' s  discrimination  proved  unsuccessful \n. โข.  HUD  itself violated  plaintiffs'  rights  II  (p . l2.) \nof  course,  is  not  our  position,  in  essence  or  otherwise.  HUD \ni s  liable  because  of  what  it did  - namely,  knowingly  participate \nin,  approve  and  fund  a  racially  discriminatory  housing  system  -\nnot  because  of  its  f ailure  to  dissuade  CHA  from  discrimination. \nIn  one  of  i ts  briefs  below  HUD  made  ironยทc  compari son: \n~his \n\"Jf  rnerc  knowJedge  of  the  Ci .y 's  intenbon  ยทto \nresist.  c1cv;egreqa.tion  imJ..:>licat.es  IIUD ,  then \nthe  policem.J.n  is  .indeed  implicutยทd  in  the \nncfaL;rus  activities  of  those  he  pursues.\" \n(Rec .  Item  52,  PUD's  memorandum,  p.  J3-A. ) \nHe  responded  that  the  policeman  is  implicated  in  the  nefarious \nof  those  he  pursues  if,  having  failed  to  dissuade \nactivi~ies \nthem,  he  participates  in,  approves  and  funds  their  activities. \n- 2-\n\nThe  Court  is  respectfully  referred  to  pages  4-7  of  our \ninitial brief  for  a  summary  of  the  facts  concerning  BUD's \nknowledge  of  CHA's  discriminatory  site  selection practices \nand  the  detailed  and  extensive  role  HUD  played  in  them,  even \n- to  \"negotiating\"  with  CHA  concerning  its  sites.* \nIn  our  initial brief we  said  that  three  cases,  Hicks  v. \nWeaver,  Shannon  v.  HUD  and  Green  v.  Kennedy ,  as  well  as  the \n- clear  language  and  intent of  42  USC  ยง2000d,  showed  that  under \nthese  facts  a  claim  for  relief  against HUD  had  been  established. \n(Initial br.  p.24. )  HUD ' s  brief  fails  to  deal  in  any  adequate \nway  with  these  cases  and  har dly  even  mentions  ยง2000d  in  this \nconnection.  Apart  from  mischaracterizing  our  argument  BUD's \nbrief  on  the  legality  of  its  conduct  really  reduces  to  the \nsยทtunning  assertion  that.  because  of  the  \"dilemma\"  (p .16)  that \n*BUD's  brief  is  rife with  suggestions  that  plaintiffs  have \nnot  specified  the  \"exact  [HUD]  conduct\"  which  wronged  them \n(p . l3) ,  or  given  a  \"specific  instance\"  in which  BUD \nacted  in  a  manner  with  which  they  disagree  (Ibid.),  or \n\"expressly  argued\"  that  HUD  wronged  t.hem  by  not  disapproving \nproposed  CHA  sites  (p.l7),  and  the  like  (although \ninconsj stently  as  well  as  incorrectly  IIUD  else''ยท'here  says \nยทLhat  the:~  \"only  <J llegcd  wrongdoing  on  HUD 's  parl was  to \nproviclc  federal  fj nancial  c ss:tsi.:ance  to  CHA  ... \"  - p.ll). \nThj s  is  ostrich- lil-:e.

As  to  such  a  \"defense\" \nthe  district  court  in  the  companion  case  said: \n\"I t  is  also  undenied  that  sites  for  the \nprojec ยทs which  have  been  constructed  were \nchosen  primarily  to  further  the  praiseworthy \nand  urgent  goals  of  ldw  cost  housing  and \nurban  renewal.  Nevertheless,  a  deliberate \npolicy  to  separate  the  races  cannot  be \njustified by  the  good  intentions  with  which \nother  laudable  goals  are  pursued.  Brown  v . \nBoard  of  Education  of  Topeka,  Shawnee \nCounty,  Kansas,  347  U.S.  483,  74  S.Ct.  686, \n98  L.Ed.  873  (1954) .\"  296  F.Supp.  at  914.* \nIn  Hicks  v.  Weaver  the  court  said: \n\"This,  then,  is  a  case  where  the \ndominant  factor  in  selecting  sites  for  the \nl ocation  of  public  housing  was  the  racial \nconcentration  of  the  neighborhoods.  Its \npurpose  was  to  perpetuate  segregation  of \nt he  races  i n  public  housing,  and  t he  present \nlocation  of  the  sites  will most  likely \nperpetuate  discrimination.

Moreover, \nHUD's  \"distinguishing\"  of  Hicks  relates  solely  to  the  appropriate \nform  of  relief,  not  to  liability;  the  holding  of  Hicks  is  that \nBUD  violated  ยง2000d  by  doing  precisely  what  HUD  has  done  in \nChicago  (e:cept  that  in  Chicago  HUD  djd  it over  a  longer  period \nof  tirne) .

But \ncertainly  it is  t oo  late  in  the  hi story  of  the  law  of  race \nrelations  in  this  country  to  argue  that  good  intentions \ninsulate  government  officials  from  liabili ty  for  r acially \ndiscriminatory  actions. \n\"It is  of  no  consolation  to  an  individual \ndenied  the  equal  protection  of  the  laws \nthat  i ยทt  was  done  in  good  faith  ... \"  Burton \nv.

Shannon  held  that  ยง2000d  was \nviolated  where  HUD  had  approved  sites  under  a  subsidized \nhousing  program \\o?hich  11Would  seem  to  have  the  same  potential \nfor  perpetuating  racial  segrega  ion  as  the  low  rent  public \nhousing  program has  had.

(pp.  17-\n18. )  But  Shanno:r:_  also  says  that  such  discretion  \"must  be \nexercised within  the  framework  of  the  national  policy  against \ndiscrimination  in  federally  assisted  housing,  42  USC  ยง2000d, \nand  in  favor  of  fair  housing  ... \"  436  F.2d  at  819,  emphasis \nadded.  Obviously  HUD  has  no  discretion  to  violate  ยง2000d, \nnor  does  it have  the  temerity  to  make  that  argument  in  so  many \nwordsยท.  Its  treatment  of  Shannon,  hmvever,  seems  designed  to \ncreate  just that  implication. \nIn  a  related  connecti on  HUD,  while  making  no  mention  of \nยง2000d,  argues  at  length  that  national  housing  policy  vests \na  great  deal  of  responsibility  in  local  housing  agencies. \n(pp.  15- 16.)  The  inference,  presumably,  is  that  HUD  should  be \nabsolved  from  responsibility  for  participating  in,  approving \nand  funding  local  discrimination.  We  pointed  out  in  our \ninitial brief  (and  there  1 as  been  no  resronss  Ly  BUD)  that \nit '\\'las  the  obvious  inLcnt.  of  Congress  tllut  ยง2000d  ap:rly  to \ndiscriminat.i('D  carr:iE:il  on  by  a  '>catc  01:  other  local  polit.icu.l \nsubdivision.  (p.20. )  Plainly  the  thrust  of  a  s'.atute which \nspecifically  prohibits  discrimination  in  locally  administered \nprograms  cannot  be  avoided  by  pointing  to  a  general  policy  to \n- 7-\n\nvest  large  responsibility  in  local  administrators. \n-\nHUD's  knowing  participation  in,  and  approvu.l  and  funding \nof,  a  program  involving  de  jure  racial  segregaยทtion  in  si tc \nselection  is  as  strong  a  case  of  violation  of  ยง2000d  as  is \n-\nlikely  to  be  found.  If  that  section was  violated  in  Shannon, \nsurely  it was  violated  here.* \n!IUD  likewise  fails  to  distinguish  Green  v.  Kennedy.  There \nthe  Internal  Revenue  Service  conceded  that  ยง2000d  would  be \nviolated  by  granting  tax  benefits  to  segregated  schools  if \n\"state  action11  were  involved  in  their operation,  and  the  court \nheld  it to  be  violated  as  well  by  a  grant  of  such  benefits \nto  wholly  private  segregated  schools  (i.e.,  schools  not  infused \n- \\.Vith  \"staLe  action\").  We  observed  in our  initial brief  (p.23) \nthat  if ยง2000d  is  violated  by  aiding  piivate  discrimination, \nas  Gre~ v.  Kennedy  held,  ~ fortiori  it is  violated  by  aiding \nstate  (e.g.,  CHA)  discrimination.

The  fact  that  HUD  did  not \nbelieve  that  its participation  in  and  approval  and  fundjng  of \ndiscriminatory  site selection was  unlawful  is  no  more  relevant \nthan  its  pursuit  of  laudable  housing  goals  and  lack  of  segregative \npurpose.  In  both  Hicks  and  Shannon  HUD  was  held  to  have \nviolated  ยง2000d  for  conduct  which  preceded  a  determination \nthat  its site  selection  approvals  were  unlawful.

Accordingly,  the  case  is  not  moot. \n?econd,  there  i  a  continuing  dispute  over  the  l egality \nof  HUD's  conduct.  In  United  States  v.  W.  T.  Grant  Co . ,  345 \nU.S.  629,  632  (1953),  the  Court  said  that  voluntary  cessation \nof  allegedly  illegal  conduct  does  not  make  a  case  moot,  for \n\"A  controversy  may  r  main  to  be  settled  in  such  circumstances, \ne.g.,  a  dispute  over  the  legality  of  the  challenged  practices \n!citations  omitted].''  Here,  HUD  continues  to  insist  that  its \nactions  were  perfecยทtly  la'i.Yful,  thu  underlining  the  impor-tance \nof  a  judicial  determination  that HUD's  conduct  was  a  violation \nof  plaintiffs'  rights  and  that  the  excuses  advanced  by  HUD  in \nits brief  o  not  justify  such  unlawful  action  by  federal \nofficials. \nThirdJ  the  fact  that  the  particular  relief of  termination \nof  funding  for  specific  projects  is  not  in  issue  does  no \nrender  the  case  moot.  Even  if plaintiffs  were  not  seeking \nther  relief ,  \"A  court  may  grant  decJ aratory  relief  tho1..:gh  it \nchooses  not  to  i  sue  an  injun ctj on  01.  mandamus.\"  Powe.J l  v. \n1'-J.c(;_o.~~tacJ:,  395  U.S.  f86,  499  (1969);  r:,cc  alFo,  395  U.S.  a-L  5J7-l8 . \nas  mooted  ~impJy because,  b  reason  of  0ngning  co113truction \nduring  UlC  pendency  of  the  case,  plaintiffs  no  longer  seck  to \nenjoin  financial  assistance  to  specjfic project  .  \"Where  several \n- 16-\n\nforms  of  relief  are  requested  and  one  of  these  requests \nsubsequently  becomes  moot,  the  Court  has  still considered  the \nremainiHg  requests. 11  PovJel.l.  v.

However,  even  completion  of  construction  does  not  make  a \ncase  moot.  \"[C]ompletion  of  t.he  project  ...  does  not  ...  make \nthe  case  moot  in  the  Article  III  sense.

(pp.  10-11.} \nPlaintiffs  never  sought,  in  their  complaint  or  elsewhen:~,  to \nterminate  across-ยทthe-board  funding  to  CH.A.

The \nsubject matter  of  those  past  actions  - Chicago ' s  ~0-gregated \npublic  housing  system  and  its  continuing  harm  to  the  plaintiff \nclass  - persists  as  a  subject  matter  upon  which  Lhe  Court's \njudgment  can  operate.

This  is  especially  important \nwhere,  as  here,  the  \\vronqdoer  is  the  Federal  Government  and \nthe wrong  is  racial  discrimination. \n\"IM]any  minority  group  members  arc  losing \nfaith  in  the  Federal  Government 1s  will  and \ncapacity  to  protect  their  rights.

See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499, 505-06. \n \n \n1  The original complaint named the Housing Assistance Administration, then a corporate agency of HUD, as the defendant. \nAlthough the petitioner in this case is the current Secretary of HUD, this opinion uses the terms โpetitionerโ and โHUDโ\n \ninterchangeably. \n \n2  The complaint sought to enjoin HUD from providing funds for 17 projects that had been proposed by CHA in 1965 and 1966 and \nfrom making available to CHA any other financial assistance to be used in connection with the racially discriminatory aspects of \n \nthe Chicago public housing system. In addition, the respondents requested that they be granted โsuch other and further relief as the \nCourt may deem just and equitable.โ \n \n3  Before the stay of the action against HUD, the District Court had certified the plaintiff class in the CHA action and had rejected \nCHAโs motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on the counts of the complaint alleging that CHA had intentionally selected \n \npublic housing sites to avoid desegregating housing patterns. 265 F.Supp. 582. \n \n4  CHA admitted that it had followed a policy of informally clearing proposed family public housing sites with the alderman in whose \nward the proposed site was located and of eliminating each site opposed by the alderman. 296 F.Supp. 907, 910, 913. This \n \nprocedure had resulted in the rejection of 99ยฝ% Of the units proposed for sites in white areas which had been initially selected as \nsuitable for public housing by CHA. Id., at 912. \nWith regard to tenant assignments, the court found that CHA had established a racial quota to restrict the number of Negro families \nresiding in the four CHA family public housing projects located in white areas in Chicago. The projects, all built prior to 1944, had \nNegro tenant populations of 7%, 6%, 4%, and 1% Despite the fact that Negroes composed about 90% Of the tenants of CHA \nfamily housing units and a similar percentage of the waiting list. A CHA official testified that until 1968 the four projects located \nin white areas were listed on the Authorityโs tenant-selection form as suitable for white families only. Id., at 909. \n \n5  In July 1968, CHA had in operation or development 54 family housing projects with a total of 30,848 units. Statistics submitted to \nthe District Court established that, aside from the four overwhelmingly white projects discussed in n. 4, supra, 92% Of all of \n \nCHAโs family housing units were located in neighborhoods that were at least 75% Negro and that two-thirds of the units were \nsituated in areas with more than 95% Negro residents. Id., at 910. \n \n6  The District Courtโs remedial decree divided Cook County into a โGeneral Public Housing Areaโ and a โLimited Public Housing \nArea.โ The โLimited Public Housing Areaโ consisted of the area within census tracts having a 30% Or more nonwhite population \n \nor within one mile of the boundary of any such census tract. The remainder of Cook County was included in the โGeneral Public \nHousing Area.โ 304 F.Supp., at 737. Following the commencement of construction of at least 700 family units in the General \n \n\n \nHills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976) \n \nPublic Housing Area of the city of Chicago, CHA was permitted by the terms of the order to locate up to one-third of its General \nPublic Housing Area units in the portion of Cook County outside of Chicago. See id., at 738-739. \n \n7  The Court of Appeals found that โHUD retained a large amount of discretion to approve or reject both site selection and tenant \nassignment procedures of the local housing authorityโ and that the Secretary had exercised those powers โin a manner which \n \nperpetuated a racially discriminatory housing system in Chicago.โ 448 F.2d, at 739. Although the appellate court stated that it was \nโfully sympatheticโ with the โvery real โdilemmaโ โ presented by the need for public housing in Chicago, it ruled that the demand \nfor housing did not justify โthe Secretaryโs past actions (which) constituted racially discriminatory conduct in their own right.โ\nIbid. \n \n8  The courtโs July 1969 order directing CHA to use its best efforts to increase public housing opportunities in white areas as rapidly \nas possible had not resulted in the submission of a single housing site to the Chicago City Council. A subsequent order directing \n \nthe submission of sites for 1,500 units by September 20, 1970, had eventually prompted CHA to submit proposed sites in the \nspring of 1971, but inaction by the City Council had held up the approval of the sites required for their development. See \nGautreaux v. Romney, 332 F.Supp. 366, 368. \nThe District Court subsequently took additional measures in an attempt to implement the remedial orders entered against CHA. In \nMay 1971, the city of Chicago and HUD agreed to a letter of intent that provided that the city would process sites suitable for use \nby CHA to permit the Authority to commence acquisition of sites for 1,700 units in accordance with a specified timetable. HUD \nthen released certain Model Cities funds on the condition that the City Council and CHA continue to show progress toward \nmeeting the goals set forth in the May letter. After the city fell far behind schedule, the District Court granted the respondentsโ \nrequest for an injunction directing HUD to withhold $26 million in Model Cities funds until the city remedied its existing deficit \nunder the timetable. See Id., at 368-370. The Court of Appeals reversed the injunction, holding that the District Court had abused \nits discretion in ordering funding cut off. 457 F.2d 124. \nBetween July 1971 and April 1972, the City Council failed to conduct any hearings with respect to acquisition of property for \nhousing sites and did not approve land acquisition for any sites. Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, 342 F.Supp. 827, 829.\nFollowing the filing of a supplemental complaint naming the mayor and the members of the City Council as defendants, the \nDistrict Court found that their inaction had prevented CHA from providing relief in conformity with the courtโs prior orders. In a \nfurther effort to effectuate relief, the court ruled that the provision of Illinois law requiring City Council approval of land \nacquisition by CHA โshall not be applicable to CHAโs actions . . . taken for the purpose of providing Dwelling Units.โ Id., at 830. \nthe Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Gautreaux v. City of Chicago, 480 F.2d 210. \n \n9  Although CHA participated in the proceeding before the Court of Appeals, it did not seek review of that courtโs decision and has \nnot participated in the proceedings in this Court. \n \n \n10  Although the trial courtโs desegregation order in Milliken did not direct the adoption of a specific metropolitan area plan, it did \ncontain detailed guidelines for the panel appointed to draft the desegregation plan. 345 F.Supp. 914 (ED Mich.). The framework \n \nfor the plan called for the division of the designated 54-school-district desegregation area into 15 clusters, each containing a part of \nthe Detroit school system and two or more suburban districts. Within this framework, the court charged the panel with the \nresponsibility for devising a plan that would produce the maximum actual desegregation. Id., at 918, 928-929. See 418 U.S., at \n733-734, 94 S.Ct., at 3121-22, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1084-85. \n \n11  The Court of Appeals interpreted the Milliken opinion as limited to a determination that, in view of the administrative complexities \nof school district consolidation and the deeply-rooted tradition of local control of public schools, the balance of equitable factors \n \nweighed against metropolitan area school desegregation remedies. See 503 F.2d, at 935-936. But the Courtโs decision in Milliken \nwas premised on a controlling principle governing the permissible scope of federal judicial power, a principle not limited to a \nschool desegregation context. See 418 U.S., at 744, 94 S.Ct., at 3126-27, 41 L.Ed.2d at 1090-91. \nIn addition, the Court of Appeals surmised that either an interdistrict violation or an interdistrict segregative effect may have been \npresent in the case. There is no support provided for either conclusion. The sole basis of the appellate courtโs discussion of alleged \nsuburban discrimination was the respondentsโ Exhibit 11 illustrating the location of 12 public housing projects within the portion \nof the Chicago Urbanized Area outside the city limits of Chicago. That exhibit showed that 11 of the 12 projects were located in \nareas that, at the time of the hearing in November 1972, were within one mile of the boundary of a census tract with less than a \n70% White population. The exhibit was offered to illustrate the scarcity of integrated public housing opportunities for the plaintiff \nclass and for lower income white families and to indicate why the respondents did not โexpect cooperation from the suburban \nareasโ in providing housing alternatives in predominately white areas. In discussing the data underlying the exhibit, counsel for the \nrespondents in the trial court expressly attempted to avoid the โpossible misconceptionโ that he was then asserting that the \nsuburban municipalities and housing authorities were โguilty of any discrimination or wrongdoing.โ In view of the purpose for \nwhich the exhibit was offered and the District Courtโs determination that โthe wrongs were committed within the limits of \nChicago,โ it is apparent that the Court of Appeals was mistaken in supposing that the exhibit constitutes evidence of suburban \ndiscrimination justifying metropolitan area relief. \n \n\n \nHills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976) \n \nIn its brief opinion on rehearing, the Court of Appeals asserted that โit is reasonable to conclude from the recordโ that the intracity \nviolation โmay well have fostered racial paranoia and encouraged the โwhite flightโ phenomenon which has exacerbated the \nproblems of achieving integration.โ 503 F.2d, at 939-940. The Court of Appealsโ speculation about the effects of the discriminatory \nsite selection in Chicago is contrary both to expert testimony in the record and the conclusions of the District Court. Such \nunsupported speculation falls far short of the demonstration of a โsignificant segregative effect in another districtโ discussed in the \nMilliken opinion. See 418 U.S., at 745, 94 S.Ct., at 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d at 1091. \n \n12  The Court in Milliken required either a showing of an interdistrict violation or a significant segregative effect โ(b)efore the \nboundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate units for remedial \n \npurposes.โ Id., at 744, 94 S.Ct., at 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1091. In its Amicus memorandum in Milliken, the United States argued \nthat an interdistrict remedy in that case would require โthe restructuring of state or local government entitiesโ and result in โjudicial \ninterference with state prerogatives concerning the organization of local governments.โ \n \n13  Although the State of Michigan had been found to have committed constitutional violations contributing to racial segregation in the \nDetroit schools, 418 U.S., at 734-735, 94 S.Ct., at 3122, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1085, n. 16, the Court in Milliken concluded that the \n \ninterdistrict order was a wrongful exercise of judicial power because prior cases had established that such violations are to be dealt \nwith in terms of โan established geographic and administrative school system,โ Id., at 746, 94 S.Ct., at 3128, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1092,\nand because the Stateโs educational structure vested substantial independent control over school affairs in the local school districts. \nSee Id., at 742-744, 94 S.Ct., at 3126-27, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1090-91. In Milliken, a consolidation order directed against the State \nwould of necessity have abrogated the rights and powers of the suburban school districts under Michigan law. See Id., at 742, 94 \nS.Ct., at 3126, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1089-90, n. 20. Here, by contrast, a metropolitan area remedy involving HUD need not displace the \nrights and powers accorded suburban governmental entities under federal or state law. See Part III-B, Infra. \n \n14  Illinois statutes permit a city housing authority to exercise its powers within an โarea of operationโ defined to include the territorial \nboundary of the city and all of the area within three miles beyond the city boundary that is not located within the boundaries of \n \nanother city, village, or incorporated town. In addition, the housing authority may act outside its area of operation by contract with \nanother housing authority or with a state public body not within the area of operation of another housing authority. Ill.Rev.Stat. c. \n67ยฝ, ss 17(b), 27c (1973). \nAlthough the state officials in Milliken had the authority to operate across school district lines, the exercise of that authority to \neffectuate the courtโs desegregation order would have eliminated numerous independent school districts or at least have displaced \nimportant powers granted those uninvolved governmental entities under state law. See n. 13, Supra. \n \n15  In principal markets such as Chicago, the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area is coterminous with the housing market area. See \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, FHA Techniques of Housing Market Analysis 13 (Jan. 1970); Department of \n \nHousing and Urban Development, Urban Housing Market Analysis 5 (1966). \n \n16  In the District Court, HUD filed an appendix detailing the various federal programs designed to secure better housing opportunities \nfor low-income families and represented that โthe Department will continue to use its best efforts in review and approval of \n \nhousing programs for Chicago which address the needs of low income families.โ \n \n17  It was this statutory prohibition that HUD was held to have violated by its funding of CHAโs housing projects. See 448 F.2d, at \n740. \n \n \n18  A HUD study of the implementation of the project-selection criteria revealed that the actual operation of the minority housing \nopportunity criterion depends on the definition of โarea of minority concentrationโ and โracially mixedโ area employed by each \n \nfield office. The meaning of those terms, which are not defined in the applicable regulations, 24 CFR s 200.710 (1975), varied \namong field offices and within the jurisdiction of particular field offices. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nImplementation of HUD Project Selection Criteria for Subsidized Housing: An Evaluation 116-117 (Dec. 1972). \n \n19  In fiscal year 1975, new contract commitments under the s 8 program were approximately $10.7 billion, as compared to total \nestimated new contract commitments of approximately $16.35 billion for all federally subsidized housing programs. The \n \ncomparable figures for fiscal year 1976 indicate that $22.725 billion of a total of $24.8 billion in new contract commitments are to \nbe made under the s 8 program. See Hearings on Department of Housing and Urban Development Independent Agencies \nAppropriations for 1976, before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 5, pp. 85-86 \n(1975). See also Id., at 119 (testimony of HUD Secretary Hills). \n \n20  Under the s 8 program, HUD contracts to make payments to local public housing agencies or to private owners of housing units to \nmake up the difference between a fair market rent for the area and the amount contributed by the low-income tenant. The eligible \n \ntenant family pays between 15% And 25% Of its gross income for rent. See 42 U.S.C. s 1437f (1970 ed., Supp. IV). \n \n\n \nHills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976) \n \n \n21  If the local unit of government in which the proposed assistance is to be provided does not have an approved housing-assistance \nplan, the Secretary of HUD is directed by statute to give the local governmental entity 30 days to comment on the proposal, after \n \nwhich time the Secretary may approve the project unless he determines that there is not a need for the assistance. 42 U.S.C. s \n1439(c) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). In areas covered by an approved plan, the local governmental entity is afforded a 30-day period in \nwhich to object to the project on the ground that it is inconsistent with the municipalityโs approved housing-assistance plan. If such \nan objection is filed, the Secretary may nonetheless approve the application if he determines that the proposal is consistent with the \nhousing assistance plan. s 1439(a). The local comment and objection procedures do not apply to applications for assistance \ninvolving 12 or fewer units in a single project or development. s 1439(b). \nThe ability of local governments to block proposed s 8 projects thus depends on the size of the proposed project and the provisions \nof the approved housing-assistance plans. Under the 1974 Act, the housing-assistance plan must assess the needs of lower income \npersons residing in or expected to reside in the community and must indicate the general locations of proposed housing for lower \nincome persons selected in accordance with the statutory objective of โpromoting greater choice of housing opportunities and \navoiding undue concentrations of assisted persons.โ 42 U.S.C. s 5304(a)(4)(A), (C)(ii) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). See H.R.Rep.No.93-\n1114, p. 8 (1974). See also City of Hartford v. Hills, 408 F.Supp. 889 (Conn.1976). In view of these requirements of the Act, the \nlocation of subsidized housing in predominantly white areas of suburban municipalities may well be consistent with the \ncommunitiesโ housing-assistance plans. \n \n \n \n \n  \n ",

All \nduties of the Public Housing Administration and other predecessor agencies were transferred to the authority of HUD by that law. \n \nWe shall refer to HUD as both the predecessor and present agency. \n \n2  Because of the racial distinctions expressly found to be present in the tenant assignment and site selection practices involved in the \npublic housing sites at issue in the CHA case and in this present suit, we do not deal with a situation such as confronted the \n \nSupreme Court in its recent decision of James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 91 S.Ct. 1331, 28 L.Ed.2d 678 (1971). \n \n3  Since supporting affidavits and other documents had been submitted by both parties, this should actually be treated as the grant of a \nmotion for summary judgment. Rule 12(b), Rule 56 F.R. Civ.P. \n \n \n4  For an account of at least one set of unique problems confronting the District Judge see this Courtโs opinion in Gautreaux v. \nChicago Housing Authority, 436 F.2d 306. \n \n \n5  The statute reads in full: โThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy \nexceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interests and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the \n \nUnited States.โ \n \n6  We agree with the District Court that the requisite jurisdictional amount has been stated. \n \n \n7  Had the cases been consolidated and decided together, the possibility of mootness would not, of course, have arisen. Thus, in Hicks \nv. Weaver, supra, the Court entered an injunction against both the local housing authority and the Secretary of HUD. \n \n \n8  The Shannon court stated: โThe defendants suggest that because the project has been completed and occupied by rent supplement \ntenants there is no longer any relief which may feasibly be given. The completion of the project and the creation of intervening \n \nrights of third parties does indeed present a serious problem of equitable remedies. It does not, however, make the case moot in the \nArticle III sense. Relief can be given in some form.โ \n \n9  For example, we are advised that โSection 236 Housingโ is a low income housing program designed to increase the flow of such \nhousing by favorable interest assistance payments to the mortgage lender. Unlike the public housing programs now before us, local \n \ngovernmental approval is not required for such housing to be constructed. See also: โSection 235โ and โSection 231โ housing \nprograms. \n \n10  Thus this suit is unlike Watkins v. CHA, 406 F.2d 1234, (7 Cir., 1969) where reinstatement of previously evicted named plaintiffs \nrendered the cause moot, as between the original parties to that same case. \n \n \n11  Favorable HUD action, for example, might have been a factor in the district courtโs decision to modify the โbest effortsโ clause of \nthe original Judgment Order in that case so as to order submission of approximately 1500 sites to the City Council in accordance \n \nwith a specific timetable. See: 436 F.2d 306, 310. \n \n12  The Governmentโs brief points to affidavits submitted by many of the present plaintiffs which starkly illustrate that fact. Plaintiff \nGautreaux has accepted public housing in Negro areas only because she had been living in a one bedroom apartment with a family \n \nof six. Plaintiff Odell Jones had moved to segregated public housing with his wife and three children to escape their two rooms in \n \n\n \nGautreaux v. Romney, 448 F.2d 731 (1971) \n \n \nwhich โthe rats had begun to run over the house at will.โ \n \n13  โNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง\n \n2000d. \n \n14  โ* * * it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of \ndisagreement with them.โ Brown v. Board of Education (Brown II), supra, 349 U.S. at 300, 75 S.Ct. 753 at 756. \n \n \n15  Our holding thus is not based on the โjoint participationโ doctrine set forth in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, supra, and \nrelied upon in the District Court litigation below. We need not discuss the applicability of that doctrine, for it is concerned with a \n \ndifferent inquiry, namely, โupon identifying the requisite โstate actionโโ. (Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, \n1796, 29 L.Ed.2d 338) sufficient to render admitted discrimination actionable under the Fourteenth Amendment. In any event, \ncontrary to the Governmentโs assertions on appeal, โjoint participationโ already has been โextendedโ to federal government \noperations. Simkins v. Moses H.

NATURE  OF  THE  CASE \nPlaintiffs,  tenants  of,  or  applicants  for,  public \nhousing  in  the  City  of  Chicago,  have  alleged  that  the \nDepartrne~t \nof Housing  and  Urban  Development  (HUD)  has  participated in  the \ncarrying  on  of  a  segregated  public housing  system  in  Chicago  in \nviolation  of  the  plaintiffs'  right  to  equal  protection of  the \nlaws.  This  Court  on  June  19,  1967,  continued  the  instant  case \non  its  own  motion  pending  disposition  of  the  companion  case \n(No.  66  C  1459)  filed  by  plaintiffs  against  the  Chicago  Housing \nAuthority  (CHA). \nThis  Court  has  now  found  in  the  companion  case  that \nCHA  against  the  plaintiffs  in  its  site \ndiscrimina~ed  sclec~ion \n\n-2-\nand  tenant  assignment  practices,  and  has  directed CHA  to  take \nall  steps  necessary  to  increase  the  supply  of  new  public \n1 \nhousing  units  on  a  nondiscriminatory basis. \nOn  October  31,  1969,  plaintiffs  filed  their  motion \nfor  summary  judgment  and  supporting  briefs.  This  brief  is \nsubmitted by  Petitioners  as  Amici  Curiae  in  support  of \nplaintiffs'  motion. \nII.  REASONS  FOR  THIS  MOTION \nThe  amici  curiae  are  all organizations  dedicated  to \nthe  elimination of  segregation  in housing,  and  have  been \nextensively  involved  in  education  and  litigation directed  toward \nthe  achievement  of  that goal.  They  have  examined  plaintiffs' \nmotion  for  summary  judgment  and  supporting  brief,  as  well  as \nthe  record  in  this  case  and  the  proceedings  in  the  companion \ncase.  They  are  convinced  not  only  that  the  position  of  the \nplaintiffs  is  sound  but  that  the  Court  is  presented  with  a \nunique  opportunity  to  fashion  an  order  which  will  afford  a \n1.  VII.  CHA  shall  affirmatively  administer  its public  housing \nsystem  in  every  respect  (whether  or  not  covered by  specific \nprovisions  of  this  order)  to  the  end  of  disestab \njuogm~nt \nlishing  the  segregated  public  housing  system  which  has  re \nsulted  in  CHA's  unconstitutional  site  selection  and  tenant \nassignment  procedures.  Without  limiting  the  foregoing, \nA.  CHA  shall use  its best  efforts  to  increase  the \nsupply  of  Dwelling  Units  as  rapidly  as  possible  in \nconformity  with  the  provisions  of  this  judgment  order \nand  shall  take  all  steps  necessary  to  that  end,  in \ncluding  making  applications  for  allocations  of  federal \nfunds  and  carrying  out  all  necessary  planning  and \ndeveloping; \nJudgment  order  of  the  Court  in  Gautreaux  v.  Chicago  Housing \nAuthority,  No.  66  C  1459,  dated  July  1,  1969 \n\n-3-\nmeans  of  dealing  with  a  major  societal  problem  - the  increasing \nsegregation  of  the  races  in  the  Chicago  metropolitan housing \narea.  Accordingly,  they  are  deeply  concerned  that  plaintiffs' \nmotion  for  summary  judgment  be  granted,  and  that  appropriate \nrelief be  fashioned  in  relation  thereto. \nThe  amici  believe  that  their  direct  and  continuing \ninvolvement  with  the  elimination  of  segregated  residential \nhousing  has  given  them  insight  into  the  nature  of  the  problem \nand  possible  solutions  to  it,  which  may  prove  of  assistance  to \nthis  court  in  resolving  the  issues  presented  in  the  instant \ncause  and  in  formulating  appropriate  relief.  Therefore,  amlci \nhave  confined  this brief to  such  matters  and  have  not  discussed \nthe  narrower  questions  presented by  BUD's  pending  motion  to  dis-\nmiss  (although,  as  indicated,  amici  also  support  plaintiffs  with \nrespect  to  such  questions). \nA brief description  of  each  of  the  amicus  organizations \nfollows: \n1.  Lawyers'  Committee  for  Civil  Rights  Under  Law,  National \nand  Chicago  Offices \nThe  Lawyers'  Committee  for  Civil  Rights  Under  Law  was \norganized  on  June  21,  1963,  following  a  conference  of  lawyers  at \nthe  White  House  called by  President  John  F.  Kennedy.  The  formal \norganization  of  the  Lawyers'  Committee  is  that  of  a  non-profit \nprivate  corporation  whose  principal  purpose  is  to  involve  pri-\nvate  lawyers  throughout  the  country  in  the  struggle  to  assure \nall  citizens  of  their  civil  rights. \n\n-4-\nIn  the  field  of housing,  both  the  national  office  and \nthe  local  conยฎittees,  with  the  assistance  of  a  National  Housing \nForce  of  lawyers  with  extensive  experience  in  housing  la\\v,  have \ntaken  on  well  over  seventy-five  projects  to  promote  integration \nand  equality  in housing,  including  damage  actions  against  real \nestate  developers  under  Title VIII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of \n1968  (42  USC  3601  et  seq.),  comprehensive  litigation  against \n\"blockbusting,\"  drafting  and  securing  the  adoption  of  a  bill of \nrights  incorporating  grievance  procedures  for  public  housing \ntenants,  assisting  community  organizations  to  acquire  and  re \nhabilitate housing  foreclosed  on  by  the  Federal  Housing  Agency \nand  suing  the  Department  of Housing  and  Urban  Development  to \nobtain  access  for  neighborhood  residents  to  the  decision-making \nprocess  in  urban  renewal. \nThe  Chicago  office  of  the  Lawyers'  Conยฎittee  has  de \nvoted  a  considerable  amount  of  its  energies  to  the  problem  of \ndiscrimination  in housing,  and  the  serious  lack  of  adequate  low \nincome  housing  in  and  around  Chicago.  The  Committee  has  under \ntaken  a  number  of  projects  designed  to  assist  conยฎunity  organ \nizations  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunity  to  create  adequat e \nand  non-discriminatory  low  income  housing  in  those  neighborhoods. \n2.  The  Urban  Coalition \nOn  August  24,  1967,  at  an  emergency  convocation  in \nWashington,  D.C.,  a  group  of  1,200  persons  issued  an  urgent \nappeal  on  the  urban  crisis  to  all  concerned  Americans.  They \n\n-5-\nwere  men  and  of  diverse  interests,  and  yet  joined \n~orne~  t~2y \ntogether  there  in  a  national  effort  to  mold  a  new  political, \nsocial,  econonic  and  climate  that  would  help  to break \n~oral \nthe  vicious  cycle  of  the  ghetto.  This  convocation  was  the \nbeginning  of  The  Urban  Coalition. \nIn  the  spring  of  1968,  John  \\ยทl.  Gardner,  formerly \nSecretary  of  the  Department  of Health,  Education  and \n~elfare, \nbecame  the  Chairman  and  chief  officer  of  The  Urban \nexe~utive \nCoalition.  The  Coalition  is  governed by  a \nsteeri~~  co~mittee \nof  national  leaders  of  industry,  mayors,  labor \nleade~s: \nlead8rs,  church  and  civil  rights  leaders. \nThe  emergency  convocation  called  upon  the  nation  to \ntake  bold  and  immediate  action  to  provide  \"a  dece:-:t  home  and  a \nsuitable  living  environment  for  every  A:nerican  fa:7'.ily\" \n~ยทlith \nguarantees  of  equal  access  to  all housing,  new  and  existing. \nThe  Coalition has  assembled  a  staff  to  carry  on  that \nthro~~h \nmandate  and,  as  part  of  this  effort,  its  task  force  on  housing, \nreconstruction  and  has  concentrated .on  the  advocacy  of \ninvestme~t \nappropriate public  and  private  action  to  move  toward  these \nobjectives. \n3.  NkqCP  Le~al De~~nse and  Educational  Fund,  Inc. \nThe  NAACP  Leg-al  DefEP..se and  Educational  Fund,  Inc. \nis  a  non-profit  me~ership corporation,  incorporated  1n  1939, \nwhose  central  purpose  is  to  provide  assistar.ce  to  Kegroes \nle~al \nin  cases  involving  e:-.!.ual  1n  ed;Jcatic;, ,  enploy::12nt, \nOP?~rtunities \n\n-6-\nhousing  and  p-..:.blic  services  a:1d  accom.-c'.::::Jcc.tion.  In  recent \nyears  the  Legc.l  Defense  and  Educational  Fund,  Inc.  has \ndevoted  increc.sing  attention  to  the  need  to  make  the  federc.l \ngovernment  legally  accountable  for  its  contribution  to  the \ncreation  of  segregated  housing  patterns,  and  the  need  to  re \nquire  the  federal  government  to  act  affirmatively  to  eradicate \nthe  effects  of  its  own  past  racial  discrimination. \n4.  National  Commit tee  ~a ins t  D iscr irr.ir.a t ion  in  H::::Jus in<l.L._ __  Inc. \nThe  National  Committee  against  Discrimination  in \nHousing,  Inc.  was  established  in  J~ne,  1950,  to  carry  on  the \ncampaign  of  education  and  study  which  was  recognized  as \nessential  for  the  development  and  through  of  a  progra:-.1 \ncarryi:~g \nof  public  education  aimed  at  bringing  a~out an  end  to  racial \nsegregation  in  housing.  From  its  inception  it has  had  the  sJpp::::Jrt \nand  participation  of  practically  every  major  private  natio~al \nand  local  organization  concerned  with  i~provement,  protection, \nand  implementation  of  civil  rights,  organizations  of  the  major \nreligious  groups,  a  number  of  large  labor  organizations, \norganizations  active  in  the  housing  field,  and  ma:~y c ivic \norganizations  dedicated  to  keeping  our  American  de~ocratic \nstron3  and  free. \nsyste~ \nAmong  other  activities  the  Co1mittee  as \nfu:~ct ions \nthe  clearinghouse  and  nationwide  service  agency  for  m::::Jre  than \n1, 700  vol u:1 tary  fair  housing  groups  and  cOITL'11'.ln it y  organizations \n\n-6a-\nlocated  in  states  throughout  the  country.  The  Co:-rnittee's \nmonthly  publication,  Trends  in  Housino,  is  the  only  national \nperiodical  devoted  exclusively  to  the  housing/civil  rights \nfield  and  is widely  recognized  as  the  standard  resource. \nIn  its  report  entitled,  \"The  Impact  of  Housing \nPatterns  on  Job  Opportunities,\"  published  ir,  February,  1968, \nthe  observed: \nCo~~ittee \n\"  (O]ne  overriding  fact  seems  indisp'Jtable: \nthe  American  city  - the  center  of  commerce  and \nculture  for  the  entire metropolitan  region  - is \ndoomed  to  economic  physical \nstra~gulation, \ndecay,  and  social  disruption  unless  solutions \nare  sought  and  instituted  on  an  inter \nprogra~s \nrelated  regional  basis.  The  most  fervent  attempts \nto  improve  the  life of  those  ccnfined  in  the \nnation's  dark  ghettos  cannot  eliminate  poverty, \ndeprivation  and  racial  unless  the \nalie~ation \nincreasing  of  employnent \n~ovement  opport~nities \nto  suburban  localities  is  taken  into  account, \nand  unless  - regardless  of  race  - are \n~orkers \nable  to  live  in  reasonable  proximity  to  their \njobs.\"  (p. 3) \nIII.  THE  If.IPORTA.'..\"'\\JCE  0?  THI--S -CASE \n~ \n'I'he  reasons  <:.ยท:hy  the  issues  ::::-aised  in  this  case  are \nimportant  can  be  sumraarized  as  follo:.ยท:s: \n\n-7-\n(1)  Negroes  must  have  equal  access  to  unsegregated \nhousing  if they  are  to have  equal  access  to \nquaaty  education,  to  employment  opportunities, \nand  to  full  participation  in  American  Society; \n(2)  truly  equal  access  to  unsegregated  housing \ncannot  be  obtained  within  the  limits  of  the  City \nof  Chicago  but  will be  achieved  only  if the  en \ntire metropolitan  area  is  recognized  as  the \nunitary housing  market  that  it is,  and  is  so \ntreated; \n(3)  these  objectives  cannot  be  achieved  unless  HUD \nuses  all  of  its programs  affirmatively,  to \nsecure  the  foregoing  goals,  because  HUD  is  and \nhas  always  been  the  agency  most  deeply  involved \nin housing  programs  throughout  the  entire  Chicago \nmetropolitan  area. \nPetitioners  will  demonstrate  in  this  brief that  (a) \nit is  essential  that plaintiffs  obtain  relief on  a  metropolitan-\nwide  basis,  ar.d  (b)  HUD's  entire  spectrum  of programs  be  used \nto  achieve  such  relief. \nIV.  EQUAL  ACCESS  TO  HOUSING  MUST  BE  PROVIDED  ON  A  METROPOLITAN \nWIDE  BASIS \nThe  entire  Chicago  metropolitan  area  must  be  used  in \nlocating  the  additional  dispersed  units  of public  housing  called \nfor  by  this  court.  Limiting  the  location  of  those  units  to  the \nCity  of  Chicago  would  foster  the  polarization  of  races  between \ncity  and  suburb.  In  order  to  effectively  disestablish  the \ncurrently  segregated public housing  system  in  the  City  of  Chicago \nsome  of  the  future  units  of  governmentally  subsidized housing \nmust  be  placed  in  white  neighborhoods  throughout  the  Chicago \nsuburban  arc2. \n\n-8-\nAdequate  relief  to  the  plaintiffs  requires  that  they \nobtain  housing  in  areas  where  they  have  equal  access  to  quality \neducation  and,  above  all,  to  a  source  of  employment.  The \nKerner  Commission  commented: \nMost  new  employment  opportunities  do  not  occur  in \ncentral  cities,  near  all-Negro  neighborhoods.  They're \nbeing  created  in  suburbs  and  outlying  this \nare~s--and \ntrend  is  likely  to  continue  indefinitely. \nRacial  segregation  in housing  has  excluded  low-income \nNegroes  from  most  suburban  areas.  Although  Negroes  have  been \nunable  to  find  homes  in  these  areas,  industries  have  been \nwelcomed  and  have  established  small  and  large  plants.  Major \ncorporations  with  factories  and  other  facilities  have  moved  out \nto  the  suburbs  to  avoid  the  growing  cost  of  land  in  the  central \ncities.  The  result  is  a  substantial  movement  of  job  opportunities \nout  of  the  central  city  to  the  suburbs.  These  job  opportunities \nrun  the  whole  gamut  from  highly  skilled,  highly  paid  professional \npositions  to  unskilled  labor  in  factories  and  service  industries. \nBut  those  who  would  be  the  source  of  supply  for  many  of  these \npositions,  the  low-income  Negroes  living  in  the  ghettos,  find \nthemselves  barred  from  applying  for  and  accepting  these  positions \nbecause  there  are  no  living  accommodations  available  to  them  in \nthe  suburbs  near  the  new  job  opportunities.  Only  housing  that \nis  located  near  these  employment  opportunities  can  allow \nplaintiffs  to  achieve  truly  equal  protection  of  the  laws. \n2.  Report,  National  Advisory  Commission  on  Civil  Disorders,  p.392. \nBantam  Books  ed.  1968. \n\n-9-\nSegregated  public bousing  in  Chicago_ha$  also  denied \nother  advantages  to  its  residents,  which  would  not  be  the  case \nif such  housing  were  dispersed  throughout  the  entire metro-\npolitan  area.  \"The  location  of  ones  place  of  residence  de-\ntermines  the  accessibility  and  quality of many  everyday  ad-\nvantages  taken  for  granted by  the  mainstream  of American  society,\" \nthe  President's  Committee  on  Urban  Housing  reported  last  year. \n\"Among  these  commonplace  advantages  are  public  educational \nfacilities  for  a  family's  children,  adequate  police  and  fire \n3 \nprotection,  and  a  decent  surrounding  environment,  to  name  a  few.\" \nV.  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  HOUSING  Al\\TD  URBAN  DEVELOPl\"'lENT  IS \nFINANCING  HOUSING  THROUGHOUT  THE  AREA \n~lliTROPOLITAN \nThe  federal  government  has  played  a  significant  role \nin  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  the  racial ghetto  through \nits p~ograms designed  to  stimulate  housing  construction  and  home \nownership.  The  rapid  growth  of  segregated  suburban  housing \nsince  the  1930's  has  been  accomplished primarily  through  Federal \nHousing  Administration  (FHA)  and  Veterans  Administration  (VA) \nfinancing.  FHA  insurance  has  been  available  almost  exclusively \nin  suburban  areas;  and,  until  1948,  FHA  encouraged  and  enforced \n4 \nracial  restrictive  covenants  in  housing  financed  by  it. \n3.

Report  of  the  National  on  Urban  Problems  (Chairman \nCo~~ission \nPaul  H.  Douglas)  House  Document  No.  91-34,  1968,  P.  101. \n\n-10-\nThe  Kerner  Commission  recognized  this  federal  involve-\nment  and  recommended  that: \nFederal  housing  programs  must  be  given  a  new  thrust \naimed  at overcoming  the  prevailing  patterns  of  racial \nsegregation.  If this  is  not  done,  those  programs \nwill  continue  to  concentrate  the  most  impoverished \nand  dependent  segments  of  the  population  into  the \ncentral  city ghettos  where  there  is  already  a \ncritical gap  between  the  needs  of  the  population  and \nthe  public  resources  to  deal  with  them.  (p.  28) \nThe  harsh  fact  is  that  the  pattern of black  ghettos \nin  our  major  cities  is growing  rather  than  abating,  and  the \ngrowing  rings  of  lily white  suburbs  which  enclose  our  central \ncities  make  it clear  that  there  is  an  increasing  urgency  to \nmobilize  every  force  of  government  to  deal  with  the  problem. \nThe  Federal  devices  which  are  at  hand  must  be  used  now. \nIn  recent  years  Congress  has  increasingly  recognized \nthe  need  for  additional  assistance  for  the  construction  of  low \nand  middle  income  housing,  and  Congressional  authorization \nhas  been  granted  for  a  number  of  new  programs  directed  to<.vard \nthis  goal.  Moreover ,  Congress  has  not  only  authorized  an \nexpanded  set  of  low  income  housing  programs  to be  administered \nby  HUD,  but has  stated that  it is  the  national  policy  to provide \nfor  fair  housing  throughout  the  United  States  (Civil  Rights  Act  of \n1968,  Title VIII,  Section  801),  and  has  directed  the  Secretary \nof  HUD  to  \"administer  the  programs  and  activities  relating  to \nhousing  and  urban  development  in  a  manner  affirmatively  to \nfurther  the  policies  of  this  title.\"  (Ibid.  Section  808(e)(S); \nsee  also  Jones  v.  Mayer  Co.,  392  U.S.  409  (1968).  In  addition, \nthe  Department  has  other housing  resources  not  specifically \n\n-11-\ndesigned  for  low  and  middle  income  groups  but  which  are \navailable  for  the  use  of  such  groups. \nAt  this  stage  of  the  proceedings  1t would  be  pre-\nmature  for  petitioners  to  suggest  the  total  nature  of  the \naction  HUD  might  take  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case.  How-\never,  the  following  list is  illustrative  of  HUD  programs  which \nappear  to  offer  obvious  opportunities  for  providing  low  and \nmoderate  income  housing  to  plaintiffs  throughout  the  Chicago \nmetropolitan  area.  (The  Chicago  metropolitan  area has  been \ndefined by  HUD  for  housing  market  purposes  as  the  \"Chicago, \nIllinois,  Housing  Market  Area,\"  consisting  of  six  counties  in \nnortheastern  Illinois:  Cook,  DuPage,  Lake,  McHenry,  Kane  and \n5 \nWill  Counties.  ) \nA.  FHA  Foreclosures \nA  source  for  additional  housing  suitable  for \nplaintiff's  occupancy  may  be  piovided by  FHA  foreclosures. \nThere  are  a  substantial  number  of  these  units  throughout  the \nChicago  metropolitan  area.  Methods  could  be  devised  to  permit \noccupancy  of  such  units  by  low-income  Negro  families. \nB.  Section  2 21 (d) ( 3)  Housing  Program \nThe  Section  22l(d)(3)  program  is  designed  to  offer  3% \nFederal  Housing  Administration  insured mortgage  financing  to \nlimited  profit,  nonprofit,  or  cooperative  housing  sponsors  to \n5.

Rent  supplements  (which  are  generally  available  to \nthose  whose  income  is below  the  maximum  established  for  public \nhousing  within  a  particular  area)  are  available  within  such \nprojects  under  Section  101  (j) (1) (A)  of  the  Housing  Act  to  en-\nable  low  income  families,  such  as  the  plaintiffs,  to  occupy \nunits  constructed  under  this  section. \nC.  Section  236  Housing  Program \nUnder  Section  236,  a  program primarily  designed  for \nlower  income  families  and  to  replace  the  Section  22l(d) (3)  pro-\ngram,  FHA  pays  to  the  commercial  mortgage  lender  of  the \nsponsor,  who  may  be  either  limited profit,  nonprofit,  or \ncooperative,  interest  assistance  payments,  which  can  reduce \nfinancing  charges  to  those  consistent  with  a  1%  mortgage. \nMaximum  income  limits  for  tenants  are  set  at  135%  of  those  for \npublic  housing  in  the  area.  Rentals  in  236  projects  are \nappropriate  primarily  for  families  whose  annual  income  ranges \n6 \nbetween  $4,000  and  $6,500.  Unlike  the  public housing  program, \nthe  Section  236  program  can  be  used  in  localities  without  local \ngovernmental  approval. \nUnder  Section  101  (j) (1) (D)  of  the  Act  20%  of  the  units \nin  a  236  development  may  be  occupied by  tenants  receiving  rent \nsupplement  payments,  i.e.,  low  income  families  such  as  the \nplaintiffs. \n6.  Report  of  the  President's  Committee  on  Urban  Housing,  Supra, \np.  65 \n\n-13-\nD.  Section  235  Home  Ownership  Proqram \nThis  section  enables  low  income  families,  who  have \ntraditionally been  able  only  to  live  in  rental  units  to  purchase \nnew,  substantially  rehabilitated,  or  existing  homes.  This  pro-\ngram  is  O?en  to both  profit  and  nonprofit  sponsors.  Monthly \nmortgage  ~sistance payments  are  made  to  the  mortgagee  which, \nas  in  ~:  36  program,  reduce  interest  costs  to  as  low  as  1%. \nMaximum ::  ~orne  limits  for  prospective  purchasers  are  set  at  135% \nof  the  public housing  limits.  This  housing  should be  available \nto  those,  including  persons  such  as  plaintiffs,  in  the  broad \n7 \nrange  of  incomes  between  $3,000  and  $7,000  a  year.  Like \nSection  236  programs,  Section  236  housing  can  be built without \nlocal  governmental  approval. \nE.  Section  231  Program \nSection  231  of  the  Act  is  designed  to  stimulate  the \nproduction  of housing  for  the  elderly  (i.e.,  those  65  years  of \nage  or  older)  through  a  program of  FHA  insurance  of below \nmarket  rate mortgages.  However,  since  these  favorable  mortgage \nand  interest  terms  are  available  if as  little as  a  bare  majority \nof  a  project's  units  are  designed  for  occupancy  by  the  elderly, \nthis  program  affords  an  opportunity  for  substantial housing \nfor  low  income  families,  such  as  the  plaintiffs,  as  well. \nSection  231  projects  may  be  occupied by  rent  supplement  tenants \nunder  Section  lOl(j) (1) (B)  of  the  Act  when  they  are  sponsored by  a \npublic  instrumentality or  by  a  private  nonprofit  organization. \n7.  Ibid.  p  66. \n\n-14-\nThe  programs  outlined herein  are  not  exhaustive. \nThey  merely  illustrate  the  great  potential  for  affirmative \naction  by HUD  to provide  additional  dwelling  units  to  low \nincome  Negro  families,  thus  advancing  the  Court's  purposes, \nparticularly respecting  Article VII  of  the  judgment  order  in \nthe  companion  case. \nVI.  THIS  COURT  HAS  THE  POWER  TO  GRANT  THE  RELIEF  SOUGHT  HEREIN. \nThe  involvement  of HUD  in the  discrimination  in housing \nwhich  is  the  subject  of  the  instant proceeding  and  its  companion \ncase  is  obvious.  HUD  has  sanctioned  this  discriminatory pro-\ngram  and  has  given  financial  support  to this  program.  In \nCooper  v.  Aaron,  358  U.S .  1,  19  (1958)  the  Supreme  Court  held \nit a  violation  of  the  equal  protection  clause  for  a  state  to \nsupport  or  participate  in  ostensibl y  private  racial  segregation \n''through  any  arrangement,  management,  funds,  or  property.\" \nFederal  agencies  themselves  have  taken  the  position  that  the \nFifth  Amendment  bars  them  not  only  from  themselves  discriminating \non  the basis  of  race,  but  also  from  sanctioning  discrimination. \nThus  the  National  Labor  Relations  Board has  withdrawn  certification \nto  act  as  bargaining  representatives  under  the  National  Labor \nRelations  Act  from  unions  engaging  in  racial  discrimination. \nIndependent  Metal  Workers  Union  Locals,  No.  1  and  No.  2 \n(Hughes  Tool  Co.)  147  N.L.R.B.  1573,  56  L.R.R.M.  1289  (1964). \nTo  grant  relief  consisting  merely  of  an  order  to  BUD \nto  deny  further  funds  to  CHA  would,  as  this  court  has  noted  in \n\n-15-\nits  opinion  in  the  companion  case,  \"damage  the  very persons  this \nsuit has  brought  to  protect.\"  (p.  20).  This  court  clearly \nhas  the  power  to  grant  relief in  the  form  of  required  remedial \nacts  by  HUD  to  correct  the  effects  of  a  pattern  and  practice \nof  racial  discrimination.  Louisiana  v.  U.S.,  380  U.S.  145  (1965) \nU.S.  v.  Jefferson  County  Board  of  Education,  372  F.2d  836,  887 \n(C.A.  5,  1967);  Clark  v.  Board  of  Education  of  Little Rock  School \nDistrict.,  374  F.2d  569,  (C.A.  8,  1967).  The  submission  of  a \nspecific plan by  HUD  is  an  appropriate  first  step.  Thereafter, \nif desired by  the  court,  amici  would  consider  providing \nassistance  to  the  court  in  whatever  manner  the  court  deemed \nappropriate. \nVII.  CONCLUSION \nIn  order  to provide  full  relief  from  the  denial  of \nequal  protection  suffered by  plaintiffs'  additional housing \nunits  must be  made  available  to  them  throughout  the  Chicago \nMetropolitan  Area.  The  pepartment  of Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment  must  provide  meaningful  assistance both  in pro-\nviding  and  in producing  this  needed  housing  through  the  variety \nof  low  and  moderate  income  programs  at  its  disposal.  The \nKerner  Commission  strongly  recommended  that  Federal  housing \nprograms  be  expanded  on  a  metropolitan  basis  to  solve  the \nproblem  of  segregated public  housing: \nTo  date,  housing  programs  serving  low-income  groups \nhave  been  concentrated  in  the  ghettos.  Non-ghetto \nareas,  particularly  suburbs,  for  the  most  part  have \n\n-16-\nsteadfastly  opposed  low-income,  rent  supplement,  or \nbelow-market  interest  rate  housing,  and  have  success \nfully  restricted  use  of  these  programs  outside  the \nghetto. \nWe  believe  that  federally  aided  low  and  moderate  in \ncome  housing  programs  must  be  reoriented  so  that  the \nmajor  thrust  is  in  nonghetto  areas.  Public  housing \nprograms  should  emphasize  scattered  site construction, \nrent  supplements  should,  wherever  possible,  be  used \nin  nonghetto  areas,  and  an  intensive  effort  should \nbe  made  to  recruit  below-market  interest  rate  sponsors \nwilling  to  build  outside  the  ghettos. \nThe  reorientation  of  these  programs  is  particularly \ncritical  in  light  of  our  recommendation  that  6  million \nlow  and  middle-income  housing  units  be  made  available \nover  the  next  five  years.  If  the  effort  is  not  to  be \ncounter-productive,  its main  thrust may  be  in  non \nghetto  areas,  particularly those  outside  the  central \ncity.  (p.  482) \nIt has  been  widely  observed  that  the  court's  judgment \norder  in  the  conpanion  case  breaks  new  ground  in  fostering \nsuch  a  reorientation.  The  court  now  has  an  unparalleled  oppor-\ntunity  to  bring  this  preliminary work  to  its  logical  fruition. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nRichard  F.  Babcock \nCharles  A.

The \nimportance  of  this  case  in  the  area  of  public  housing  and  the \nfuture  of  our  cities must  not  be  underestimated . \n\nI.  INTEREST  OF  THE  AMICI \nUrban  Law  Institute.  The  activities  of  the  Urban  Law \nInstitute  of  George  Washington  University  (hereafter  ci ted  as \nULI)  have  focused  on  the  very  real  housing  def iciencies  i n \nthe  nation.  ยทunder  the  direction  of  attorney-professor  Jean \nCamper  Cahn,  ULI  has  produced  numerous  tangible  and  distinctive \nchanges  in  housing  institutions  in  Washington,  D.C.  With  the \nacademic  support  and  direction  of  George  Washington  University, \nthe  program  has  expanded  and  made  more  responsive  those \ninstitutions  serving  the  poor. \nIllustrative  of  the  changes  in  housing  resulting  from \nULI  activity  are: \na)  On  behalf  of  a  community  housing  corporation, \nnegotiations  were  successfully  completed  securing \nthe  corporation  an  FHA  mortgage  to  cover  renovation \nand  also  a  redevelopment  agency  land  write-down. \nb)  Created  the  first  grocery  store  in  the  country  in \na  public  housing  project  to  overcome  the  obvious \nhardships  resulting  from  the  lack  of  such  services. \nc)  Formed  a  corporation  to work  with  tenants  and \npotential  owners  to  secure  federally  insured  mort \ngages  and  assume  homeowner  responsibilities. \nd)  Intervened  on  behalf  of  client groups  to  success \nfully  dissuade  the  local  housing  authority  from \n-2-\n\nbeginning  housing  construction  in  a  greatly \novercrowded  area. \nThe  Urban  Law  I nstitrite  al so  works  closel y  with  the \nUr ban  Pl anning  Depart ment  of  George  Washi ngton  University  1n \ncoordinating  attacks  on  urban  probl ems . \nCitizens  Advocate  Center.  The  Citizens  Advocat e  Center, \nlocated  in  Washington,  D.C.  and  under  the  direction of \nDr.  Edgar  S.  Cahn,  is  a  non-profit  organization  designed  to \nfunction  as  a  watchdog  of  federal  grant-making  agencies  having \nsignificant  impact  on  low-income  citizens.  The  objective  of \nthe  Center  is  to  increase  the  effectiveness  and  r esponsi veness \nof  the  administrative  process,  including  the  administ rat ion  of \nfederal  housing  programs.  The  methodology  used  is  a  compar ison \nof  program  performance  with  program  requirements,  usually \nentailing  a  field  check  by  local  community  groups,  as  well as \na  review  of  agency  reports  and  audits.  In  t his  manner,  programs \nin  several  cities  across  the  nation  have  been  scrutinized  in \ndepth. \nCAC  also  has  worked  with  federal  agencies  i n  order  to \nmake  their  programs  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the \ncommunity.  For  example ,  CAC  has  worked  with  the  Department  of \nTransportation  in  setting up  fair  hearing  pr ocedures  and  has \nworked  with  HUD  in  the  area  of  relocation  of  persons  displaced \n-3-\nยท' \n\nby  housing  programs. \nII.  THE  CASE  AGAINST  HUD \nIt is  not  the  purpose  of  this  brief  to  detail  t he \nextensive  participation  of  HUD  and  its predecessor  agencies \nin  the  discriminatory  conduct  of  CHA.  The  activity which \nviolated  the  Fifth Amendment  and  Title VI  of  the  1964  Civil \nRights  Act  (42  U.S.A.  ยง2000d)  is  convincingly  set  forth  in \nplaintiffs'  brief  in  support  of  a  motion  for  summary  judgment. \nIndeed,  BUD's  own  pleadings  acknowledge  knowing  participati on \nwith  the  illegal,  discriminatory  activity of  CHA  and  thus  HUD \nvirtually  admits  violating  plaintiffs'  rights. \nThis  case,  at  least with  respect  to  questions  of  site \nselection,  is  almost  identical  to  the  recently  decided  case  of \nHicks  v.  Weaver,  302  F.Supp.  619  (1969).  In  that  case,  HUD \nwas  found \nII  an  active  participant  since  it could  have \nhalted  the  discrimination  at any  step  in  the \nprogram.  Consequently,  its own  discriminatory \nconduct  in  this  respect  is  violative  of  42  U.S.C. \nยง  2000d.\"  Hicks  v.  Weaver,  at  623. \nThe  important  distinction between  this  case  and  the \nHicks  case  rests  in  the  remedy  area.  Whereas  the  court  in \nHicks  resorted  to  the  extreme  measure  of  cutting  off  federal \nfunds,  plaintiffs  here  pray  for  more  productive  r elief;  that \n..,..4-\n\nis,  that  HUD  be  directed  to  formulate  a  specific  program  to \ncorrect  the  pernicious  effects  of  over  two  decades  of \ndiscriminatory  site  selection  and  t enant  assignments  in \nChicago 's  public  housing  program. \nThere  are  two  reasons  why  plaintiffs'  prayer  for  relief \nis  an  appropriate  solution  to  this  controversy: \n1)  HUD  is  the  only  organization  capable  of  giving \neffective  relief. \n2)  HUD  is  the  sole  agency  having  the  power  to  act \nwith  the  speed  warranted  by  the  urgency  of \nplaintiffs'  positions- poor  blacks  concentrated \nin  the  center of  the  city. \nHUD  is  the  only  organization  capable  of  r esolving  the \nracial  concentration  of  blacks  in  central  Chicago  because  the \nproblem  is  not  restricted  to  the  city  limits  of  Chicago.  Rather, \nit is  a  metropolitan  problem  necessitating  a  metropolitan \nsolution.  It is  in  the  surrounding  white  suburbs  that much  of \nthe  problem  lies.  As  the  National  Commission  on  Urban  Problems \nhas  stated:  \"The  urban  problem  can  be  described  as  the  big \ncity  slum,  and  as  the  white  suburban  noose.\"  (Report  of  the \nNational  Commission  on  Urban  Problems,  Chairman  Paul  H.  Douglas, \nHouse  Document  No.  91-34  (1968)  at p.l.) \nHUD,  unlike  CHA,  is  not  restricted  geographically  to  the \n-:-5-\n\ncity  limits  of  Chicago  in  formulating  a  solution.  And  HUD, \nunlike  CHA,  is  equipped  with  myriad  housing  programs  which \ncan  be  utllized  to  give  the  metropolitan  sol ution  this  case \nnecessitates. \nThe  public  housing  program  in  Chicago  is  but  one  part \nof  the  ever-growing  \"urban  problem.\"  This  case  cannot  be \nviewed  in  isolation  for  it is  very  much  a  part  of  that  problem. \nPublic  housing,  as  exemplified  by  this  case,  has  done  much  to \nfurther  the  racial  polarization  taking  place  in  our  major \ncities  today .  As  described  by  the  National  Advisory  Commission \non  Civil  Disorders: \n\"Almost  all Negro  population  growth  (98  per \ncent  from  1950  to  1966)  is  occurring  within \nmetropolitan  areas,  primarily within  central \ncities. \n\"The  vast majority  of white  population  growth \n(78  per  cent  from  1960  to  1966)  is occurring \nin  suburban  portions  of metropolitan  areas . \nSince  1960,  white  central-city population  has \ndeclined  by  1.3  million. \n\"As  a  result,  central  cities  are  becoming  more \nheavily  Negro,  while  the  suburban  fringes \naround  them  remain  almost  entirely  white.\" \n(Report  of  The  National  Advisory  Commission \non  Civil  Disorders,  Chairman  Otto  Kerner , \nU.S.  G.P.A.  1968,  p.6.) \nThe  more  recent  study  performed  by  the  National  Commission \non  Urban  Problems  (The  Douglas  Report)  indicates  this  polariza-\ntion will  continue  to  create  two  societies:  one  black  and  urban, \n-6-\n\n'  ' \nthe  other white  and  suburban  - separate  and  unequal. \n\"The  overwhelming  majority  of  the  future  of \nnonwhite  population  growth  is  likely  to  be \nconcentrated  in  central  citi es  unless  maj or \nchanges  are  made . \nIt is  entirely  possible  that  a  greater \nconcentrati on  of  Negroes  in  the  central  cities \nwould  be  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  tension \nand  violence.  If  this  violence  is  met  by  re \npressive  measures  there  could  be  further  polariza \ntion  of  blacks  and  whites,  and  the  flight  of  more \nand  more  businesses,  and  therefor e,  jobs,  from  the \ncity. \nThe  suicidal  consequences  that  such  a  possi \nbility  suggests  are  not  pleasant  to  contemplate. \nThey  threaten  our  count ry.\"  (Douglas  Report ,  p.S.) \nThus,  Chicago,  like  the  other  great  cities  of  this  nation, \nis becoming  an  increasingly  all-bl ack  city.  HUD,  which  has  as \na  national  goal  the  lessening  of  racial  concentrations  in  the \ncentral  cities,  has  ignored  this  and  approved. the  discrimina-\ntory  actions  of  CHA.  In  the  process,  it has  aggravated  the \ntrend  toward  racial  polarization  in Chicago.  One  need  not \nponder  for  any  great  length  of  time  to  realize  what  is  happening \nin  the  process.  Our  central  cities  are  becoming  the  poverty, \ndrug,  disease,  slum,  and  crime  centers  of  our  nation.  The \nNational  Commission  on  the  Causes  and  Prevention  of  Violence \n(Dr.  Milton  Eisenhower,  Chairman),  in  its  recent  report  issued \nin  November,  1969,  has  projected  the  look  of  the  city of  the \nnear  future.  In  a  few  more  years,  lacking  effective  public \n~7-\n\n.. \naction,  this  is  how  these  cities will  look: \nCentral  business  districts  in  the  heart of  the \ncity,  ..โข  will  be  largely  deserted  except  for \npolice  patrols  during  nighttime  hours. \nHigh-rise  apartment buildings  . . .  will be  forti \nfied  cells  for  upper-middle  and  high-income \npopulations  ... \nSuburban  neighborhoods,  geographicall y  far \nremoved  from  the  central  city,  will  be  protected \nby  economic  homogeneity  and  by  distance  from \npopulation  groups  with  the  highest  propensities \nto  commit  crimes . \n...  ownership  of  guns  will  be  almost  universal \nin  the  suburbs,  homes  will  be  fortified  by  an \narray  of  devices \n...  armed  guards  will  \"ride  shotgun\"  on  all  forms \nof  public  transportation. \nStreets  and  residential  neighborhoods  in  the \ncentral  city will  be  unsafe  in  differi ng  degrees, \nand  the  ghetto  slum  neighborhoods  wil l  be  places \nof  terror with  widespread  crime,  perhaps  ent irely \nout  of  police  control  during  the  nighttime  hours. \nBetween  the  unsafe,  deteriorating  central  city \non  the  one  hand  and  the  network  of  safe,  pr os \nperous  areas  and  sanitized  corridors  on  the  other, \nthere  will  be,  not  unnaturally ,  intensifying \nhatred  and  deepening  division.  (Commission  State \nment  on  Violent  Crime:  Homicide,  Assault,  Rape, \nRobbery,  by  the  National  Commission  on  the  Causes \nand  Prevention  of  Violence,  Chairman, Dr.  Milton S. \nEisenhower,  November,  1969,  pps.  16-17.) \nThe  Eisenhower  Report,  the  third  report  by  a  national \ncommission  on  urban  problems  in  as  many  years,  paints  the  above \npicture  of  our  cities  to  stress  the  urgency  of  the  problem.  The \nfacts  are  that  as  each  day  passes ,  the  racial  polarizations  in \n-8-\n\n'  ' \nthe  central  city  and  suburb  continue.  The  situation  in  Chicago \nis  particularly  acute  as  pointed  out  by  two  urban  experts: \nII  the  fact  remains  that  the  sheer  numbers \nrequired  for  dispersal  of  the  ghetto  through \nsuburbanizati on  make  the  occunence  unlikely. \nFor  example ,  achieving  the  population  l evel \n. of  350,000  blacks  outside  the  central  city  of \nChicago  by  1980  ... would  r equire  a  net \nmigration  plus  natural  increase  of  15,000 \nblacks  per  year  for  the  next  15  years.\"  (W. \nW.  Stafford  and  J.  Ladner,  Comprehensive \nPlanning  and  Racism,  in  the  Journal  of  the \nAmerican  Institute of  Planners,  March  1969, \nNo.  2,  p.  73.) \nClearly,  the  time  for  effective  action  is  now.  HUD, \nwhich  administers  a  multitude  of  programs  which  can  be \nutilized  in  effectuating  programs  to  alleviate  the  racial \nconcentrations  in  the  central  city,  stands  before  this  court \nas  the  admitted  participant with  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority \nin  a  program  to  separate  the  races  in  public  housing.  To \nremedy  this  inexcusable  conduct,  plaintiffs  have  prayed  for \nan  order  against  HUD  directing  it to  create  an  imaginative, \ncomprehensive  program  to  erase  the  effects  of  two  decades  of \nsystematic  housing  discrimination  in  site selection  and  tenant \nassignment.  The  Urban  Law  Institute  and  the  Citizens  Advocate \nCenter  offer  their  services  in  formulating  such  a  program. \nIn  light of  the  growing  effort  to make  the  law  an  ally \nrather  than  enemy  of  the  poor,  as  well  as  for  the  pressing \nreasons  noted  above,  this  court  should  not  hesitate  to  fashion \n-9-\n\nan  order  that will  bring  relief not  only  to  public  housing \ntenants  such  as  the  plaintiffs  but  to  the  entire  community  as \nwell .  HUD  has  both  the  l egislative  mandate  and  the  tools \nto  do  the  job.  It is  an  unhappy  commentary  on  our  insti-\ntutions  that  this  court  must  furnish  HUD  the  will . \nRespectfully  submitted, \nJean  Camper  Cahn \nAttorney  for  Urban  Law  Institute \nof  George  Washington  University \nEdgar  S.

The  work  of \nt hese  committees  is,  and  has  been,  ciirected  at  the  wide  range \nof  urban  problems  which  confront  a ll of  us  l iving  here  in \nChicago :  the  simplification of  govern~ental structure  in \nthe  metropolitan  area ,  the  improve .e nt  of  zoning  controls , \nthe  better administration  of  the  City's  housing  code ,  the \nstrengthening  of  planning  on  a  metropolitan  area  basis , \nthe  pro tee tio:-1  and  improve  .en t  of  exi s tins  public  park  space:: , \nand  the  providing  of  suitabl e  housing  for  all our  citizens . \nt  .e  years  the  Council  has  built a  solid \nThro~ghout \nr eputation  for  recognizing  and  recommending  r2nedi2s  to \nson~ \nof  our  most  pressing  urban  problems .

The  filing  reflects \nthe  commitment  of  the  Committee  and  the  Chicago  Bar  Association \nto  accept  the  responsibility  which  the  organized  bar  has  to \nwork  to  alleviate  the  urban  crisis  now  facing  Chicago. \n1/ The  Urban  Affairs  Committee  was  formed  by  resolution \nof  ~he Board  of  Managers  in  the  summer  of  1968.  The  Statement \nof  Policy  accompanying  the  Committee's  creation  stated  that  -\npreeminent  concern  of  the  Committee  shall  be  those \n'~ \nproblems  which  weigh  most  heavily  on  racial  and  ethnic \nurban  minorities  and  to  which  the  'Kerner  Commission' \nhas  attributed a  great  share  of  the  responsibility for \nthe  pent-up  violence  and  alienation which  has,  in  the  re \ncent  past,  erupted  into wide~scale civil  disorder.\" \n\n2. \nInterest  of  Urban  Affairs  Committee  in these Proceedings. \nThese  proceedings  are  concerned  with  \"the  most  basic\"  of \nthe  f orces  underlying  the  urban  crisis:  \"the  accelerating \nsegregation of  low  income,  disadvantaged  Negroes  within  the \nghettos  of  the  largest  American  cities .\"  Report  of  the \nNational  Advisory  Commission  on  Civil  Disorders  (1968) , \np .  389  (hereinafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  Kerner \nReport) .  A  redirection of  the  federal  housing  programs  is \nessential,  the  Committee  believes,  if the  accelerating \n1/ \nsegregation  is  to  be  stopped.- The  matter  is  analyzed  in \ndetail  in  the  Kerner  Report,  concluding  as  follows  at  p .  474: \n\"Federal  housing  programs  must  be  given  a  new  thrust \naimed  at  overcoming  the  prevailing  patterns  of  racial \nsegregation.  If  this  is  not  done,  those  programs \nwill  continue  to  concentrate  the  most  impoverished \nand  dependent  segments  of  the  population  into  the \ncentral-city ghettos  where  there  is  already  a \ncritical gap  between  the  needs  of  the  population  and \nthe  public  resources  to  deal  wit hthem .  This  can \nonly continue  to  compound  the  conditions  of  failure \nand  hopelessness  which  lead  to  crime,  civil disorder \nand  social  disorganization\n9 \" \n1/  Chicago  is  no  exception  to  the  accelerating  segrega \ntion.- Since  1950  the  Negro  population  in Chicago  has  at \nleast  doubled.  \"Unless  there  are  sharp  changes  in  the  factors \ninfluencing  Negro  settlement  patterns  within  the  metropolitan \nareas,  there  is  little  doubt  that  the  trend  tuward  Negro  major \nities  will  continue.  Even  a  complete  cessation of  net  Negro \nin-migration  to  central cities  would  merely  postpone  this  result \nfor  a  few  years.\" Kerner  Report  p.  243,  391-2. \n\n3 \nIn  working  toward  a  solution  of  these  problems  the \nCommittee  is  also  concerned  that  the  judicial process  should \nmaintain  its capacity  to  fashion  effective  relief  for  those \nwhose  rights  have  been  violated,  especially  where  constitu \ntional  rights  are  involved.  The  Committee  has  thus  been \nparticularly  disturbed  by  the  suggestions  in  the  brief  of \nthe  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Develop \nment  (hereinafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  HUD)  that  this \nCourt  is  unable  to  fashion  meaningful  remedies  for  plaintiffs \nin  this  case.  This  Court  has  al ready  shown  the  contrary,  in  the \ncompanion  case  of  Gautreaux  v.  Chicago  Housing  Authority,296  F.Supp.907 \nand  we  believe  and  urge  that  this  Court  is  no  less  able  to \nsecure  plaintiffs'  rights  by  appropriate  relief  in  the  present \naction. \nBecause  of  the  urgency  of  these  concerns,  the  Urban \nAffairs  Committee  presents  the  following  brief  as  an  amicus \ncuriae,  in support  of  plaintiffs'  motion  for  summary  judg \nment. \nThe  position  of  the  Committee  is  as  follows:  (l)  in \nthe  companion  case  this  Court  has  already  found  that  CHA  vio \nlated  plaintiffs'  constitutional  rights,  in  connection with  its \nlow  income  housing  program,  and  granted  relief  against  CHA; \n\n4 . \n(2)  HUD  is  equally  as  responsible  as  CHA  for  the  violation \nof  plaintiffs'  rights  and  plaintiffs  are  equally  entitled \nto  relief  against  HUD;  (3)  the  public  interest,  as  well  as \nthe  full  protection  of  plaintiffsv  rights ,  makes  relief \n1/ \nagainst  HUD  essential .-\nI.  HUD  Is  Equally  As  Responsible  As \nCHA  For  The  Existing  Segregated \nPublic  Housing  Patterns  in  Chicago. \nThe  decision  of  this  Honorable  Court  of  February  10, \n1969  in  Gautreaux  v. ,Chicago  Housing  Authority,  makes  t he \nsubstantive  issues  \"rl  this  case  relatively simple.  The \nallegations  of  discrimination  in  the  complaint  in  that  case \nand  this  are  identical.  CHA  has  violated  plaintiffsv  rights \nto  equal  protection  of  the  laws  by  segregating  the  bulk  of \nthe  city's  low  income  housing  and  locating  it in  the  predom-\ninately  black  areas  of  the  city and  by  following  t enant  assign-\nment  policies  that  completed  the  segregation  of  CHAvs  tenants \non  the  basis  of  race.  As  a  joint participant with  CHA,  HUD  -\nwhich  knowingly  approved  the  sites  chosen  and  financed  con-\nstruction  - is  equally  responsible  for  these  violations  of \nplaintiffs'  rights. \nThe  facts  as  found  by  the  Court  in  the  earlier suit are \nclear:  CHA,  as  of  July  1968,  had  housing  projects  in  operation \n1/  This  brief  is  addressed  to  certain  of  the  substantive \nissues presented  in  this  proceedings .  It  does  not  treat  the \npreliminary  iss ues  such  as  standing ,  exhaustion  of  administrative \nremedies  or  jurisdictional  questions. \n\n5. \nor  development  at  64  sites  in  Chicago,  comprising  30,848 \nunits  in  all.  Four  of  these  projects  were  segregated \nWhite  - Trumbull,  Lathrop,  Lawndale  and  Bridgeport.  These \nwere  93%,  96%,  94% and  99% respectively  occupied  by  Whites; \na  token  quota  only  for  Negroes  was  allowed  in  each  project . \nThe  remaining  projects  of  the  CHA  were  99% occupied  by \nNegroes  and  these  projects  were  all  located  in  Negro \nareas  - that  is,  areas  where  the  residents  were  at  least \n50% Negro,  with  the  number  of  Negro  residents  increasing. \nTwo-thirds  of  these  projects  were  located  in  areas  that  were \nalready  95% Negro. \nThe  foregoing  pattern  of  site selections  was  not  the \nresult  of  chance.  Initial site selections  were  made  by \nthe  CHA  but  were  subject  to  approval  by  the  Chicago  City \ncouncil.  Ill.Rev.Stat.  (1969)  ch.  67-1/2,  sec.  9.  The \nCourt  found  t hat  over  99-1/2% of  the  units  proposed  for \nlocation  in  White  areas  were  vetoed  by  aldermanic  opposi \ntion,  but  only  10% of  those  on  Negro  sites were  vetoed.  It \nautomatically  followed  that  the  structures  were  heavily  con \ncentrated  in  Negro  areas.  This  pattern  showed  to  a  near \ncertainty  that  the  City  Council  was  following  a  policy  of \nracial segregation  and  this  court  so  found.  In  addition, \n\n6. \ncertain  high  CHA  officials  \"with  commendable  frankness\" \n(Gautreaux  v.  Chicago  Housing  Authority,  supra,  p.  912) \nadmitted  to  the  truth  of  what  the  statistics  implied. \nThe  Court  found,  on  both  the  statistical grounds  and \nthe  admissions  of  the  CHA  Officials,  that  the  plaintiffs \nwere  entitled  to  a  judgment,  as  a  matter  of  law,  that  the \nsites  had  been  selected  - in  important  part  - on  the \ngrounds  of  race,  in  violation  of  plaintiffs'  rights. \nIt should  be  noticed  that  CHA's  fault  here  was  not \nthat  of  itself  actively  discriminating  as  to  site selection. \nRather ,  in  the  words  of  this  Court,  it was  that  of \n\"participating  in  a  policy  of  maintaining  existing \npatterns  of  residential separation  of  the  races.\" \nGautreaux  v.  Chicago  Housing  Authority,  supra, \np.  915. \nAn  identical  finding  should  be  made  against  HUD. \nThis  is  not  to  impute  to  HUD  the  discriminatory  i ntent \nof  CHA,  as  HUD's  brief  (pp.  2-9)  suggests,  but  rather  to \nfind  that  both  of  them  had  the  same  unlawful  intent  of  know-\ningly  cooperating  in  the  maintenance  of  the  City  Council's \npolicy  of  racial  segregation.  In  light of  HUD's  actions, \ndespite  its  guide  lines,  site selection  criteria,  and  the \ncomplaints  of  individual  HUD  officials  (cf.  HUD  brief,  pp. \n8-9,  12-13),  that  knowing  cooperation  cannot  seriously  be \n\n7. \ndisputed,  and  HUD  makes  no  effort  to  dispute  it in  its  brief. \nThe  case  is  in  all material  respects  parallel  to  Hicks  v. \nWeaver,  302  F.Supp.  619,  62  (D.C.  La.  1969)  where  HUD's  own \nconduct  - in  approving  and  funding  construction  on  discrimin \natory sites  selected .by  local  authority- was  also  found  to  be \ndiscriminatory  in  violation  of  plaintiffs'  rights  in  that  case. \nNo  doubt  both  HUD  and  CHA  were  reluctant  to  acquiesce  in \nthe  discriminatory  site selection .  No  doubt  HUD  officials \nwere  and  are  as  innocent  of  racist  attitudes  as  this  court \nfound  the  CHA  officials  to  be.  Both  nevertheless  felt  com \npelled  to  go  along  with  what  they  presumably  deemed  to  be  the \npractical  politics  of  furthering  their  program.  In  effect \nHUD  subordinated  to  other  concerns,  plaintiffs'  constitutional \nrights  to  non-discriminatory  site selection  and  non-discriminatory \ntenant  assignment  policy.  In  so  doing  HUD  violated  the  consti \ntutional  rights  of  all residents  of  the  city,  as  well  as  those \nof  plaintiffs,  since  all residents  of  the  city  have  a  right  to \nhousing  patterns  not  racially segregated  by  state  action.  It \nlocked  the  city  into  segregated  patterns  of  housing  even  more \nfirmly  than  before  - potentially  for  the  entire  useful  life  of \nthe  brick  and  concrete  buildings  that  acquiesence  produced. \nHUD  could  scarcely  have  chosen  a  more  effective  way  of \nnu~lifyยญ\ning  all  the  good  intentions  its  brief  now  claims. \n\n8. \nII  Plaintiffs  Are  Entitled  To  A Remedy  Against  HUD. \nBecause  plaintiffs'  constitutional  rights  have  been  im \npaired  by  HUD,  plaintiffs  are  as  entitled  to  a  remedy  against \nHUD  as  they  are  against  CHA.  On  the  undisputed  facts,  there \nf ore,  we  submit  that  no  further  showing  is  needed  to  establish \nthat  relief should  be  granted. \nHUD,  however,  endeavors  to  suggest  that  even  i f  it has \nwronged  plaintiffs  no  remedy  should  be  entered  against  it. \nIt argues  that  \"plaintiffs  have  obtained  all  the  relief  to \nwhich  they  are  entitled.\"  (HUD  brief,  p.  1).  It  points  to \nthe  broad  discretion  that  is  conferred  on  the  secretary  of \nHUD  and  conjures  up  visions  of  this  Court's attempting  \"to \nwrest  control  of  these  vast  civil rights  responsibilities \nfrom  the  Secretary.\"  HUD  brief,  p.20).  With  this  is  mixed \nan  argument  of  contrary  implication,  that  no  order  should  be \nentered  against  HUD  because  HUD  \"has  undertaken  to  cooperate  in \nthe  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  .  (the]  decree\"against \nCHA.  (HUD  brief,  p.  20) ..  The  Urban  Affairs  Committee  re-\nspectfully  submits  that  all of  this  obscures  the  simple  but \nimportant  point  - that  plaintiffs,  having  been  wronged  by  this \ndefendant,  are  entitled  t9  their  remedy  against  it. \nThe  fact  that  HUD  may  have  voluntarily  ceased  its  dis \ncriminatory  conduct  of  course  does  not  forec l ose  relief  against \n\n9. \nit.  Cf.  United  States  v.  W.  T.  Grant  Co.,  345  U.S.  629,  632. \nAs  a  Committee  of  Lawyers,  we  cannot  accept  defendant~s asser-\ntion  that  plaintiffs  should  simply  rely  in  the  future  on \ndefendant's  good  intentions,  internal  regulations  and  the \nSecretary's  discretion.  Plaintiffs  have  sought  court  action \nprecisely  because  HUD  has  failed  to  administer  its  program \nconsistently with  plaintiffs'  constitutional  rights  and  it \nis  inconceivable  - at  this  stage  in  the  proceedings  - that \nplaintiffs  should  be  protected with  nothing  more  than  state-\nments  of  HUD's  future  good  intentions.  Since  at  least  1954 \nHUD  has  in  effect  been  carrying  on  a  discriminatory  housing \nprogram  in  Chicago.  Plaintiffs  should  not  now  be  relegated \nto  HUD's  promises  that  the  effects  of  its  past  actions  will \nbe  remedied  by  some  unspecified,  future,  volunt ary  acts  on \nits  part.  The  judicial  process  was  meant  for  the  fashioning \nof  more  effective  relief  than  that. \nWe  recognize  of  course  that  discretionary  decision  mak-\ning  is  necessary  in  urban  renewal  planning.  But  this  does \nnot  mean  that  the  controversies  that  arise  lie  beyond  judicial \ncognizance.  As  stated  in  Norwalk  Core  v.  Norwalk  Redevelop-\nment  Agency,  395  F.2d  920,  929  (2d  Cir.  1968): \n\"Case  by  case  inquiry  is  necessary,  with  due  regard  for \nthe  need  for  judicially  discoverable  and  manageable \nstandards  for  resolving  problems  to  be  undertaken, \nand  with  recognition  of  the  role  played  by  the  coordinate \nbranches  of  the  Federal  Government  in  the  planning  and \n1mplemen ta tion  of  urban  renewa 1.  \"  (Emphasis  added). \n\n10. \nWhen  constitutional  rights  are  involved,  as  here,  the  courts \nhave  an  essential and  central  role  to  play,  as  the  pre-emin-\nent  branch  of  the  Federal  Government,  in  such  cases. \nCourts  of  equity  are  characterized  by  broad  discretion \nand  flexibility  in  shaping  remedies  to  fit  the  facts  and \ncircumstances  of  each  case.  They  -\nII  .  may,  and  frequently  do,  go  much  further  both \nto  give  and  withhold  relief  in  furtherance  of  the \npublic  interest  than  they  are  accustomed  to  go  when \nonly  private  interests  are  involved.\"  Mr.  Justice \nStone  in  Virginian  R.Co.  v.  Federation,  300  U.S.  515 \n552  (1937)  (emphasis  added). \nA  legal  system  that  can  provide  remedies  to  desegregate \nschool  systems  (Brown  v.  Board  of  Educ.,  349  U.S.  294  (1955) \nand  cases  following)  and  to  require  legislative  reapportion-\nment  (Baker  v.  Carr ,  369  U.S.  186  (1961)  and  cases  follow-\ning)  is  clearly  capable  of  providing  remedies  for  the  protec-\ntion  of  plaintiffs  here. \nThere  is  concern  in  many  areas  over  what  is  perceived \nas  a  breakdown  of  law  and  order.  It  would  fortify  the  con-\nfidence  of  inner-city  residents  in  the  law,  as  a  living and \nconstructive  reality  in  their  lives,  if  they  see  t hat  full \nand  proper  relief  is  accorded  to  them,  without  fear  or \nfavor,  whether  against  city  or  state  agencies  or  even  against \nfederal  agencies  who  have  violated  their  rights. \n\n11. \nIII.  Relief  Against  HUD  Is  Essential  In \nThe  Public  Interest As  Well  As  To \nProtect  The  Rights  of  Plaintiffs . \nAs  this  Honorable  court  has  already  pointed  out  -\n\"Existing  patterns  of  racial separation  must  be  re \nversed  if  there  is  to  be  a  chance  of  averting  the \ndesperately  intensifying  division  of  Whites  and \nNegroes  in  Chicago  .  The  President's \nCommission  on  Civil  Disorders  estimates  that  Chicago \nwill  become  50% Negro  by  1984.  By  1984,  it may  be \ntoo  late  to  heal  racial  divisions.\"  Gautreaux  v. \nChicago  Housing  Authority,  296  F,Supp.  907,  915. \nThe  countrywide  audit  of  the  Federal  housing  programs ,  made \nby  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Civil Rights,  supports  the  fore-\ngoing  conclusion.  As  summed  up  in  the  letter  of  the  Staff \nDirector,  U.S.  Commission  on  Civil Rights ,  submitted  to  this \nCourt  in  Gautreaux  v.  Chicago  Housing  Authority: \n\"  ,  The  tax  monies  of  all  the  people  are  largely \nbe1ng  spent,  even  to  this  day,  for  low  income \nhousing  that  bonds  into  brick  and  mortar  a  nation \nthat  is  racially  separate  and  unequal.\"  (Letter  of \nJune  2,  1969.  Emphasis  added). \nThe  reason  for  the  failure  to  provide  equal  protection, \nas  suggested  by  the  Civil Rights  Commission  Director  in  the \nforegoing  letter,  ~that the  Federal  low-income  housing  system \nhas  never  put  equal  protection  as  a  first  priority.  Instead, \nit has  developed  a  system  of  second  class,  high  volume,  high \ndensity  housing  structures  that  are  unacceptable  to  those \n\n12. \nurban  neighborhoods  that  are  able  to  protect  themselves,  in \nthe  cities across  the  country.  These  structures  have  thus \nbeen  forced  into second  class,  powerless  neighborhoods, \nparticularly  the  urban,  ghetto  communities .  It  is  precisely \nfor  these  reasons  that  relief  is  essential  here,  against  HUD \nas  well  as  CHA,  in  order  that  the  constitutional  right  of \nequal  protection  of  the  laws  shall  be  established  as  an  essen \ntial prerequisite  in  all  phases  of  the  Federal/Stat~ low  income \nhousing  system. \nDifficulties  are  admittedly  involved  in  breaking  down \nthe  existing  patterns  of  urban  residential segregation  - estab-\nlished  all  too  often  by  unlawful  act ion  such  as  that  involved \n1/ \nhere.  But  a  dissolution  of  these  patterns  may  well  be  essen-\ntial  if we  are  to  survive  as  a  free  people.  For,  as  indicated \nat  p  2  above,  residential  segregation  is  the  root  cause  of  the \ngrowth  in  this  country  of  two  societies,  one  Negro  and  one \nWhite,  separate  and  unequal.  It  immeasurably  complicates  the \nproblems  of  access  to  equal,  non-segregated  schools  and  to \nequal  employment  opportunities.  It concentrates  in  the  deter-\niorating  inner  city  those  most  in  need  of  social  services ,  with \n1/ See  for  example  the  restric t ive  racial  covenants  out \nlawed-in  Shelley  v.  Kraemer,  334  U.S.  1  (1948);  also  the \ndestructive  real  estate  practice  known  as  \"block  busting\", \nmade  unlawful  in  Illinois  in  1967.

On  that  achievement  hinges  the  realization,  for  all of \nus,  of  the  most  fundamental  values  i n  our  society  - individual \ndignity ,  freedom,  equality  of  opport unity.  Thus  the  protection \nof  the  public  interest  as  well  as  the  vindication  of  private \nrights  are  clearly  involved  here.  They  both  require  the  recog-\nnition  that  injustice  has  been  done  to  the  class  of  the  poor \nrepresented  by  plaintiffs  in  this  case  - by  HUD  as  well  as  by \nCHA  - and  the  entry  of  an  appropriat e  order  against  both  HUD \nand  CHA  \"which  will  so  far  as  possible  eliminate  the  discrim-\ninatory  effects  of  the  past  as  well  as  bar  like  discrimination \nin  the  future.\"  Louisiana  v.

Romney,  Secretary \nof  the  Department of  Housing \nand  Urban  Development, \nDefendant-Appellee \nAFFIDAVIT OF  THEODORE  ROBINSON \nTheodore Robinson,  being  first duly  sworn,  upon  oath,  deposes \nand  says; \n1.  I  am  the Model  Cities Officer  in  the  Chicago  Regional  Office \nof  the  United  States Department  of  Housing  and  Urban Development  (HUD) \ncharged  with  federal  administrative  responsibility  for  the  monitoring \nand  reviewing  of  the  Model  Cities  Program  in  the  City  of  Chicago.  Among \nmy  duties,  I  communicate  Federal Model  Cities  guidelines  and  require-\nments  to  city officials,  and  review and  make  recommendations  to  the \nRegional Administrator  and  the  Assistant  Secretary of HUD  with  respect \nto  compliance  by  local Model  Cities Administrators with  such guidelines \nand  requirements. \n2.  Title 1  of  the Demonstration Cities  and  Metropolitan Development \nAct  of  1966,  Public  Law  89-754,  under which  the  \"Model  Cities\"  programs \ncame  into  existence,  provides  in part,  as  follows: \nSection 103  (a):  A comprehensive  city Demonstration  program  is \neligible  for  assistance under  Sections  105  and  107  only  if: \n\"  The  program  is  of  sufficient magnitude  to  make  a  substantial \nimpact on  the  physical  and  social  problems  and  to  remove  or  arrest \nblight and  decay  in entire  sections  or neighborhoods;  to  contribute \nto  the  sound~ development of  the  entire city;  to  make  marked  progress \nin reducing  social  and  educational  disadvantages,  ill health,  under \nemployment  and  enforced  idleness;  and  to  provide  educational,  health \nand  social  services necessary  to  serve  the  poor  and  disadvantaged \nin  the  area,  widespread  citizen participation in  the  program,  maximum \nopportunities  for  employing  residents  of  the  area  in all  phases  of \nthe  program,  and  enlarged  opportunities  for work  and  training.\" \n3.  Under  the Model  Cities  program,  the  Secretary of  the  Department \nof Housing  and  Urban Development  required  each  city receiving  a  planning \ngrantยทunder  the  program  to  set local  goals,  and  to  phase  its  plans  and \nprojects  to  substantially achieve  the  goals  stated  in Section  103  (a)(2) \nwithin  five years.  The Model  Cities  program  calls  for  a  comprehensive \n\nattack on  social,  economic,  and  physical  problems  in  selected  dis-\nadvantaged  areas  through  concentration and  coordination of  federal, \nstate and  local  public  and  private  efforts. \n4.  Section 103  (b)  provides  that  \"in implementing  this  Title \nthe  Secretary  shall \n1)  emphasize  local  initiative in  the  planning,  development  and \nimplementation of comprehensive  city demonstration programs; \n2)  insure,  in conjunction with other  appropriate  Federal  depart-\nments  and  agencies  and  at  the  direction of  the  President,  maximum \ncoordination of Federal  assistance provided  in connection with  this \nTitle,  prompt  response  to  local  initiative,  and  maximum  flexibility \nin  programming,  consistent with  the  requirements  of  law and  sound \nadministrative  practice; \n3)  encourage  city demonstration  agencies  to  (A)  enhance  neighborhoods \nby  applying  a  high  standard  of  design,  (B)  maintain,  as  appropriate, \nnatural  and  historic  sites,  and  distinctive neighborhood  characteri stics, \nand  (C)  make  maximum  possible use  of new  and  improved  technology  and \ndesign,  including  cost reduction  techniques.n \n5.  Pursuant  to  the  requirements  in  the  Act,  the  guidelines  and \nprogram  requirements  for  the Model  Cities  program have  been developed  by \nthe  Secretary of  the Department  of HUD,  in cooperation with  the Depart-\nments  of HEW,  OEO,  DOL,  DOT,  Commerce,  Justice  and  other agencies;  and \nthat review and  recommendations  for  approval  and  funding  of  locally planned \nand  designed  programs  are  conducted  by Regional  representatives  of  the \n1. \nsame  Federal Departments  and  agencies,  ~.r .. ..... ยท \n6.  In order  to  participate  in  the Model  Cities  program,  Cities  such \nas  Chicago,  were  required  to  designate  one  or more  disadvantaged  areas \nof  the  city containing no  more  than  ten percent of  the  city' s  population, \nprior  to  first receiving  a  planning  grant.  The  designated  areas were  to \nbe  substantially slum  and  blighted  areas  of  the  city  in which  low-income \nfamilies  were  concentrated,  which would  benefit  from  the  thrust of  the \nModel  Cities  programs,  i.e.,  to  attempt  to  alleviate  the  basic  problems \nof human  and  deterioration  in  the  inner  cities. \nphys~cal \n\n7.  After  a  designated  area  had  been  approved  by  HUD  as  a  Model \nCities  target area,  the  City was  awarded  a  planning  and  action year  grant, \nwhich was  to  be  spent  for  programs  and  projects within  such  target areas, \nor, for  the  direct benefit of  the  residents  of  such  areas,  in order  to \ncarry out  the Demonstration  provided  for  by  the  Congress  Act. \n8.  Federal  guidelines  for  the Model  Cities  program,  pursuant  to \nthe  requirement  that  the  city be  granted  initiative and  flexibility  in \nits choice  of projects making  up  its comprehensive  program,  permit  the \ncity demonstration program  to  allocate  its  funds  to  those  projects  it \ndetermines  to  have  highest priority,  based  upon  its own  problem analysis, \nbut  that such  problem analysis must have  considered whether  serious \nproblems  and  priority concerns  exist in education,  health,  social  services, \nrecreation,  culture,  crime  and  delinquency,  manpower  and  job development, \neconomic  and  business  development,  housing,  relocation,  transportation, \ncommunication,  enviromental  protection and  development,  and  must  include \nprogram  administration,  citizen participation,  and  an  information and \nevaluation process. \n9.  Upon  the  submission of  the  first and  second  action year  programs \nby  the  Chicago Model  Cities,  the  required  Federal  review was  performed, \nand  administrative conclusions were  1'eached  at each  program was  \"com-\nprehensive\",  within  the  meanings  of  the  Act;  that  it had  been  compiled \nand  submitted  in compliance with  the  procedures  required,  and  that  it \nsatisfied all of  the  legal  requirements  to warrant  funding,  and  for \neach year,  in  turn.  The  Assistant Secretary  for Model  Cities has \nauthorized  a  contract  to  be  offered  the  City  to  continue  the  funding \nof  its program. \n! โข \n.... ....1 \" \n10.  The  Chicago Model  Cities  program  is ยทnow  in its  second  year. \nThe  Department  of Housing  and  Urban Development has  executed  a  grant \ncontract with  the  City  of Chicago  for  a  total  sum,  to  date,  of $50,159,000, \nwhich  represents  the  1st year  program and  an  advance  on  its second  year \nprog>:am. \n11.  A contract  fo  fund  the  second  year  program was  tendered  to  the \nCity  of  Chicago,  requiring  approval  and  acceptance  by  the  City Council \nand  the Mayor  of  Chicago.  Pending  that  formal  approval,  the  City was \ngiven  a  \"letter  t6  proceed\",  under which  the  City  is authorized  to  place \nits second  year  program  projects  under  contract,  and  to  implement  them, \n\nusing  the  City's  own  funds  or  credit,  upon  HUD's  commitment  to  reimburse \nthe  City's Model  City  program  for  all  expenses  incurred  in compliance \nwith  the  offered  contract,  upon  final  execution of  the  said  contract by \nboth  parties. \n12.  To  the  best of my  knowledge  and  belief,  pursuant  to  the  \"letter \nto  proceed\",  the  Chicago  Model  Cities  placed much  of  its  second  year \nprogram under  contract with  operating  agencies,  and  has  incurred  financial \nobligations  to  such  operating agencies  for  salaries  and  wages,  and  other \nexpenses  normally  incurred  in  the  operation of  such  projects. \n13.  My  administrative  review of  the  Chicago Model  Cities  program \nreveals  that  the  program complied  with all requirements  of  Federal  Law, \nand  all departmental  rules  and  regulations.  It is my  administrative \nrecommendation  to  the Regional  Administrator  that  the  second  year Model \nCities  contract with  the  City  of Chicago  be  executed,  so  as  to  allow  the \nCity  access  to  funds  for  continuation of  their programs. \n14.

In  Harrison-Haleted  Comeamity  Group,  Inc \n   \njousing  and  Home  Finance  Agency,  310  ยฅ.24  99  (7th  Cir.  1962),  cert.  den. \n373  U.S.  944  (1963), the  Court of Appeals  said  (p.  103): \n\"##  # in  a privatsueit  in  a federal court,  where \nit  is  claimed  that  a  substantial  federal  question  is \ninvolved,  it wust clearly appear that defendanta'ctss  \nconsthte iinvastionu oft pleaintdiff s'  legal rights.โ \n   In that case, where plaintiffs sought much the same type of relief as is \nsought here,  the Cowrt there held (p.  106): \nโAs plaintiffs have failed to establish any standing to \nsue in this federal court action and have failed to raise \na Substantial federal question, the decisiofo tnhe  \nDistrict Court,  dismissing the auwended complaimnistt ,be  \nand is affirmed.โ \nHarrison-Halsted thus is dispositive of the claims in Cofints  I and III \nherein of jurisdiundcert 2i6 Uo.Sn.C .  81331- \nwhet28h Ue.Sr.C .  1343(4) provides jurisdiction of  a case against this \nFederal defendant in the light of Section Gl of Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of  1964, 42 U.S.C.  8  20004.  Im assethart tthosie prnovigsio ns \n23\n     \n  \n  \ngrant jurisdiction against  a Federal agency,  plaintiffs make  a \nfundamental error!  โThe sawe Civil Rights Act of 1964 included very \nspecial provisions by which thie defendant is to secure compliance \nwith Gection 601.  As discussed in detail hereinatbheo svtaetu,te  \nhes  detailed requixements of waruing to the party guilty of diserimin- \nation,  administrative hearing to thet party,  and reporting to the \nCongress before any cut-off of funds.  42  U.S.C.  20004-1; 200042. \nPlaintiffs  here would have  the court  read inte 26 U.S.C.  2000d  the intent of \nCongress to grant jurisdiction  te  the court under 28 U.S.C. 1343  (lb)  to \ntawart and by-pass the very procedure thus established by Congress.  Hot \nonly do plaintiffs  seek to thwart  the administrative  hearing  thus avail- \nable to CHA and the requirexent of reports by this  defendant to the \nCongress prior  to  cut-off,  but  they seek to thwart  use of  other  and less \ndrastic tools given to the Seeretary to secure compliance short of cutting \n  \noff funds.  Tt cannot be  doubted  that such  would be the effect of the \ninjunctive  relief  prayed for in each  Count of the Complaint here: \nโThat after  a  full hearing this Court permanently \nby claiming jurisdiction by reference to one section of the Civil Rights \n2h\n  \nAct of 1964 so as to seek  a form of relief in direct conflict vith \nother  proviofs  tihe oeamne sAc t.  While  it is  conceded that Section \n601 of that Act my, under some circumgsivet staandnincg teo spri,vat e \npersons to seek relief against the local agency,  Lemon  v.  Bossier Parish \nSchool Board, 240  F.Supp.  7O9  (W.D.La.,  1965) the same provisicoannnsot  \nbe read togewitth h26e U.rS.C . 1343(4) to grant either standintgo  \nplaintiffs to seek or jurisdiction to the Court to grant such relief against \nthe involved Pederal agency. \nAccordingly the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject  matter \nin this suit against the Federal defendant. \n  \n25\n  \n  \nTHERE IS NO JUSTICIABLE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN PLAINTIFFS AND  DEFENDANT \nUNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OR SECTION 601 OF THE CIVIL  RIGHTS  ACT OF  196% \nPlaintiffs  seek  a  decleration  that  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority \nis  selecting  sites  in  a  racially  discriminatory  manner  in  violation  of \ntheir rights  under the Fifth Amendment and  section 601 and that they have \nthe  right  to  halt  the  use  of  Federal  funds\"in  connection  with  the  racially \ndiscriminatory  aspects  of  the  publie  housing  system\"  carried  on  by  the \nChieago  Housing  Authority.  They  seek  to  enjoin  Federal  financial  assistance. \nThe  Constitution,  Art.  3,  82,  limits  the  exercise  of  the  judicial \npower  to  โcases  and  controversies.โ  The  Declaratory  Judgment  Act,  48  Stat. \n955,  (28  U.S.C.  8  2201,  2202)  is  applicable  to  federal  courts  omay  in \ncases  of  actual  controversy.  The  controversy  must  be  justiciable,  i.e., \nit  must  be  definite  aud  conerete  touching  the  legal  relationship  of  parties \n   having  adverse  legal  interests.  Therefore,  unless  the  complaint  discloses \nsome  legal  interest  in  the  plaintiffs,  no  justiciable  controversy  is \npresented  for  decision,  Frahn  v.  Tennessee  Valley  Authority,  41  F.Supp. \n83  (1941);  Public  Service  Comm.  v.  Wycoff,  344  U.S.  237  (1952). \nThe  eontroversy  between  plaintiffs  and  defendant  in  this  suit  is  not \na  justiciable  controversy.  The  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development \ndoes  not  select  the  sites  for  low-rent  housing  projects  in  the  City  of  Chicago. \nThe  Chicago  Housing  Authority  selects  the  sites.  Indeed  under  the  lav, \nthe  Annual  Contributions  Contract  and  administrative  practice  of  thirty \nyears'  standing,  the  defendant  has  no  right  to  dictate  to  the Chicago \nHousing  Authority  what  site  it  shall  choose.  (Affidavit  of  Marie  C.  McGuire) \n26\noe \nSince  it  is  apparent  that  the  selection  of  sites  is  done  by  the  Chicago \nHousing  Authority,  plaintiffsโ  real  controversy  is  with  the  Chicago \nHousing  Authority,  not  the  Federal  Government.  Employers Group  of  Motor \nFreight Carriers  v.  National  War  Labor  Board,  143  F.2d  145  (CCA  DC);  National \nWer Labor Board  v.  MontgoWmared rCyo. ,  bh  F.2a  528  (C.A.  D.C.) \nSpecifically  with  reference  to  section  601  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act, \nthat  section  must  be  read  with  Sec.602  chereof  which  grants  certain  rights \nto  \"yecipienteโ  of  Federal  financial  assistance.  That  this  category  excludes \nplaintiffs  was  settled  by  this  very  court  in  Green  Street  Association,  et  al. \nv.  Richard  J,  Paley,  et  al.,  No.  65  C  16h5,  decided  on  February  11,  1966, \nThis  court  there  steted:  | \nโThe  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  does  not \ncontemplate  persons  such  as  the  plaintiffs \nbringing  actions  such  as  the  present  one  under \nthe  Act.โ \nThe  court  found  there  that  the  plaintiffs not  being  \"recipients\", \ncould  not  bring  the  action.  Accordingly,  it  is  clear  that  plaintiffs \nhere  cannot  claim  the  existence  of  any  justiciable  controversy  with  the \nFederal  agency  administering  the  funds  sought  to  be  blocked  by  this  action. \nAccordingly,  the  complaint  fails  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief  can \nbe  granted. \n27\n  \nPARTY. \nThe gravamen of the plaintiffsโ  complaint is that the Chicago Houcing \nAuthority bas selected and is  continuing to select sites for low-rent \nhousing projecte in violation of plaintiffsโ rights under the Fifth \nAmendment to  the Constitution and 28  U.8.C.  ยง 20004.  Plaintiffs then- \nselves thus concede that the baeis of their cleimed injury is an ection \nof the Chicago Housing Authority,  not the named defendant in this suit. \nUnder the United Stater Housing Act of  1937,  section  1, maximum \nresponsibility for the administration of  the low-rent housing program \nincluding the selection of  sites ie vested in the local agency,  the \nChicago Housing Authority.  Further,  the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the agencies that preeetied  it,  in their aunual contri- \n  \nbutions contract with the CHA end in established  administrative regulations \nami policy of  nearly 30 years standing has always conceded the right te \nselect sites to Loon] Housing Authorities,  retaining for the  Federal \nagencies only the right to approve the sites efter their selection. \n(Affofi Madriea Cv. MieGutire ).  Usder the lav,  the contraacndt t,he  \nWUD regulations, the HUD, (including HAA), cannot and does not dictate to \nthe Chieago Housing Authority what site  it  should choose.  It has the \nright only to approve or to disepprove what the Chicago Housing Authority \nhas done.  It follows, therefore,  that the Chicago Housing Authority, and \nnot HUD,  would be in  a position to eet respecting plaintiffsโ  claim for \nrelief concerning discrimisintea steloecrtiyo n.\n  \n  \nMoreover, an injunction prohibiting the Secretary of HUD from \nextending Federal financial assistance to the Chicago Housing Authority, \nvottomed on  a declaration that the CHA has selected and is continuing \nto select  sites on an illegal and unconstitutional basis and that Federal \nfunds should not be used in furtherance thereof,  would drastically affect \nthe rights of the Chicage Housing Authority.  โThe complaint alleges that \nsince 1950 the Chicago Housing Authority has been and is seleeting  sites \nin  a  racially diserisinatmaonrneyr .  The compdemlandas tihatn Fetder al \nfunds be  cut off  if used to assist this action of the CHA, As drava, \nthe requested relief would prevent the HAA from extending annual con- \ntributions to the Chicago Housing Authority for some  71 projects con- \ntaining thousands  of  units,  all placed under contract  iu  1950 and sueceed- \ning years,  should  it be found that projects should be  sited in White \n  \nneighborhocds and Negro neighborhoods on some specified proportionate \nbasis.  The Chicago Housing Authority,  being then unable to operate these \nprojects for low-rent housing purposes, would have to convey to  HAA  title \nand possession. \nUnder these  circumstances where  the action complained of  is the \naction  of the Chicago Housing Authority and any relief granted by way of \ninjunction would drastically affect the rights  of the Chicago Housing \nAuthority, the Chicago Housing Authority is  an indispensable party.

For  the  reasons \nae  4  4 \npreviously  set  forth  in  argument  and  by  that  motion,  the  case  should \nbe  dismissed  for  plaintiffs'  lack  of  standing  to  sue  (Memorendun \npp.  7  ~  18,  Reply  Brief  pp.  1-4),  the  failure  of  plaintiffs  to  exhaust \ntheir  administrative  remedies  (Memoranduppm.   19-22),  Reply  pp.  4-6), \nlack  of  jurisdiction  over  the  subject  matter  (Memorandum  pp.  23-25), \nand  Lack  of  justdeieble  controversy  between  the  parties  (Menorandwm \npp.  26-27),  and  therefore  failure  of  the  Complaint  to  state  a  claim \nupon  which  relief  may  be  granted. \nIn  addition  to  the  cases  previously  cited  in  our  1967  briefs \non  the  foregoing  points,  we  now  rely  on  the  more  recent  controlling \ncases  of  Green  Street  Association  v.  Daley,  373  F.2@1,  8  (7th  Cir. \n1967),  cert.  den.  387  U.S.  932  and  South  Suburben  Safeway  Lines,  Inc.   \n  \nv.  City  of  Chicaro,  et  ol  (Tth  Cir.  No.  17179,  decided  October  6,  1969). \nIn  the  latter  case,  plaintiff  challenged  a  grond  of  federal \nfunds  to  the  City  and  its  trensit  authority  pursuant  to  the  Mass \nTransportation  Act  of  1964.  Federal  agency  discretion  was  challenged \nunder  statutory  provisions  requiring  certain  findings  end  conditions \nprerequisite  to  the  grant.  Those  included  decisions  (1)  that  the \ngrant  was  โessentiel  to  a  program...  for  a  unified  or  officially \ncoordinated  urban  transportation  system  as  part  of  the  comprehensively \nplanned  โ  of  the  urban  srea,\"โ  (2)  that  \"such  program,  to \nthe  maximum  extent  feasible,  provide  for  participation  of  private  mass \ntransportation  companies  .  ..  .5  and  others.  โThe  court  found  that \nplaintiffs  lacked  standing  to  sue  the  federal  defendants  and  also \nexpressed  doubt  that  the  discretion  thus  given  to  the  agency  head \ncould  be  reviewed,  concluding  (slip  opinion  p.  7) \n\"fn  the  instant  case  the  questions  (1)  whether  the \nstatute  implics  that  a  private  utility  claiming  it \nwill  suffer  competitive  injury  hes  standing,  (2) \nwhether  the  edministrative  decision  is  left  so  largely \nto  discretion  as  to  be  reviewable  at  all,  and  (3) \nes  to  the  scope  of  judicial  reviev,  tend  to  merge \ninto  one.  โThe  more  the  fulfillment  of  the  standards \nis  left  to  administrative  discretion,  the  Less  the  basis \nfor  implication  of  standing.

Cohen,  392  U.S.  83  (1963),  does \nnot  aid  plaintiffs  in  any  efforts  to  establish  standing  to  bring  this \naction.  The  Supreme  Court  there  held  that  Federel  taxpayers  can \nchallenge  the  constitutionality  of  Federal  programs  only  if  the  program \nis  an  exercise  of  congressional  power  under  the  taxing  and  spending \ncleuse  of  the  Constitution  as  cpposed  to  being  an  essentially  resula- \ntory  program,  and  if  the  challenged  enactment  exceeds  a  specific \nconstitutional  limitation  on  taxing  ond  spending  as  opposed to  โbeing \nbeyond  general  powers  of  Congress.  In  contrast,  plaintiffs  here  have \n+ โ \nnot  brought  this  case  as  texpayers.  Further,  they  are  not  challeng- \ning  the  constitutionality  of  any  legislation.  โTherefore,  their  complaint \ndoes  not  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  statutes  on  the  basis  of \n@  specific  constitutional  limitation  on  the  taxing  and  spending  power \nof  the  Federal  government,  as  Flest  requires.  โhe  Court  there  specifically \nrecognized  that  standing  will  not  be  conferred  \"where  a  taxpayer  seeks \nto  employ  a  federal  court  as  a  forwa  on  which  to  air  his  generalized \ngrievances  about  the  conduct  of  povernment  or  the  allocation  of  power \nin  the  Federal  system.\"  392  U.S.  at  106. \nIndeed,  the  recent  Seventh  Circuit  decision  in  South  Suburban \nSafevay  Lines  v.  City  of  Chiecero,  et  al.  (7th  Cir.  17179,  decided \nOctober  6,  1969),  some  after  the  Plast  decision..  Plaintiffs  in \nSouth  Suburfran were  found  to  possess  no  standing  by  reason  of  being \ntaxpayers,  the  Flast  case  being  distinguished  as  a  constitutional \n \nattack  on  a  statute  (slip  opinion  p.2).  The  Administrative  Procedure \nAct  was  found  not to  create  standing,  the  Seventh  Circuit  following \nthe  majority  view  in  that  regard  (slip  opinion  pp.  3-4).  Finally  the \nCourt  held  (in  the  possage  quoted  above)  that  plaintiffs  had  no  stend- \ning  to  challenge  the  administrative  diseretion.  (It  then  went  on  to \nSey  that,  even  if  standing  existed,  the  Federal  defendants  had  adequately \nsupported  their  action  for  summary  judgnent.)} \nSe te nee ee eee i  ve | \nSefevsy  case  and  others  cited,  should  similarly  dismiss  this  case. \nThe  motion  to  join  C.H.A,.  as  a party  defendant  herein \n should  be  denied,   \n  \nIn  our  original  motion  to  dismiss,  we  previously  esserted \nthere  the  plaintiffs'  failure  to  join  an  indispensable  party,  in  this \ncase  the  C.H.A. \nInasmuch  es  pleintiffs'  complaint  involves  and  seeks  to    \ndeny  Federal  financial  aid  to  the  C.H.A.  under  its  contract  with \nH.U.D.,  and  further,  inasmuch  as  the  discriminatory  actions  complained \nof  were  taken  by  the  C.H.A.  or  its  agents,  that  body  sevld  seen  to \nbe  an  indispensable  party.  Moreover,  the  injunction  requested  to \neut  off  or  re-allocate  H.U.D.  funds  would  drastically  affect  the \nrights  of  the  local  agency.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  C.H.A. \nis  an  indispensable  party.  Rule  19,  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure, \nTitle  28,  U.S.C.  Without  C.H.A.  as  a  party,  the  court  is  without \njurisdiction.  Batler  v.  Ickes,  89  F.2d  856,  853-9  (C.A.  D.C.) \ninvolved  a  very  analogous  situation.  See  also  Fulton  Iron  Co.  v. \nLarson,  171  F.2a  994,  993  (C.A.  D.C.);  State  of  Washington  v.  United \n     \nStates,  87  F.2d  k2l  (C.A.  9);  Money  v.  Wallin,  186  F.2d  412  (C.A.3); \n  \nPoyne  v.  Fite,  194  F.2d  977,  980  (C.A.  5);  Dargs  v.  Klein,  169  F.2a \n174  (C.A.  9);  Smart  v.  Koods,  184  F.2d  714  (C.A.  6);  Berlinsky  v. \nWoods,  178  F.2a  265  (C.A.  4);  Jacobs  v.  Office  of  Housing  Expediter, \n      \n176  ยฅ.2a4  333  (C.A.  7);  Ainsworth  v.  Darn  Bellroom  Co.,  157  F.2d  97; \n  \nLOL  (C.A.  4), \nPleintiffs  now  tacitly  conceded  the  velidity  of  that  position \nby  their  current  motion  to  join  the  C.H.A.  as  a  party.  โThey  cannot, \nhowever,  cure  the  problem  in  that  manner. \nThe  suit  has  been  filed  in  the  United  Stetes  District  Court \nfor  the  Northern  District  of  DLlinois.  Venue  is  presumed  to  be  based \non  28  U.S.C.  1391({e)(4)  as  that  is  the  only  statute  authorizing \njurisdiction  end  service  over  the  Secretary  outside  of  the  District \nof  Columbia.  Section  1391(e){4+),  however,  requires  that  each  defend- \nant  be  an  officer  or  employee  of  the  United  States  or  any  agency \nthereof.  Therefore,  any  action  in  which  both  the  H,U.D,.  Secretary \nand  C.H.A.  officials  were  defendants  could  not  be  brought  in  the \nDistrict  Court  for  the  Northern  District  for  Illinois.  Chase  Savings \nend  Loan  Assn  v.  Federal.  Home  Loan  Benk  Board,  et  al.,  269  F.Supp. \n965  (E.D.  Pa.,  1967).   \nRule  82  of  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  specifically \nprovides  that  the  Federal  Rules  should  not  be  construed  to  extend \nor  limit  the  jurisdiction  of  the  District  Court  of  of  the  eon  or \nactions  therein.  Consequently,  neither  Rule  4(c)  nor  eny  state  long- \narm  statute  can  be  invoked  to  obtain  jurisdiction  by  a  court  which \ndoesn't  have  venue,  ebsent  a  waiver  of  venue.  Venue  end  jurisdiction \ncould  not  be  obtained  over  local  Chicago  officials  in  the  District \nCourt  for  the  District  of  Columbia.  The  result  of  these  facts  is \nthat  while  the  city  is  en  indispensable  party,  there  is  no  court  in \nwhich  a  single  suit  can  be  brought  against  both  the  Federal  Government \nand  the  local  officials, \nRule  19(b)  of  the  Federal  Civil  Rules  requires  that  the \nwhole  case  be  dismissed  under  this  very  circumstance,  the  absent \nparty  being  indispensable  but  not  joinable, \nWherefore  and  for  the  reasons  stated  the  Defendant's  1 \nMotion  te  Dismiss  should  be  allowed. \nDefendant's  Motion  to  Dismiss  to  be  treseted  as  one  in \nthe  eltemative  for  Sumnary  Judoment  | \nIn  addition  to  the  papers  originally  filed  in  suvport  of  the \nmotion  to  dismiss  (copies  of  regulations,  contract,  affidavits,  etc), \nthere  are  submitted  herewith  edditional  papers  as  part  of  our  memo- \nrandum  in  opposition  to  plaintiffsโ  motion  for  summary  judement.  Under \nCivil  Rule  12(b),  F.R.C.P.,  Title  28,  U.S.C.,  such  papers  are  to  be \ntreated  under  Rule  56,  as  if  submitted  on  a  motion  for  summary  judrmenht. \nWe  therefore  do  ask  the  Court  to  consider  the  motion  of  defendant \n \nas  one  in  the  alternative  for  summary  judgement.  It  is  clear  that  the \ndefendant  and  his  predecessors  have  not  engaged  in  illegal  conduct \nbut  have,  to  the  contrary,  engaged  in  vigorous  enforcement  efforts  on \nwhich  no  factual  issue  is  raised. \n  \n  \nBRIEF \nMEMORANDUM  IN  OPPOSITIOTNO   PLAINTIF?SS* \nMOTION  FOR  SUMMARY  JUDCMENT \nPlaintiffs  have  moved,  pursuant  to  Rule  56  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil   \n.\nG\nD\nU\nProcedure,  for  summary  judgment  on  the  ground  that  there  is  ne  cenuine  OJ\nT\n \nissue  as  to  any  material  fact  and  that  plaintiffs  are  entitled  to   ยซ .MM\nSU\nNS\nA\njudgment  as  a  matter  of  law.  Plsintiffs  have  also  moved  to  add  the  r   .F .T\ne EO\ne  DN\nChicaso  Housing  Authority  as  a  party  defendant,  and  have  asked  leave  ee\n' \nto  withdraw  plaintiffsโ  pending  motion  to  consolidste  this  cause  with \nGautreaux,  et  al.  v.  CHA,  G5  C  1459,  as  well  as  leave  to  withdraw  their \npending  motion  for  discovery. \nDefendant  contends  that  the  notten  for  summary  judgment  must  be  denied \ndecause  plaintiffs  are  not  entitled  to  judzment  as  a  matter  of  law  even \nif  they  are  able  to  establish  all  of  the  allegations  of  their  complaint. \nMoreover,  as  indicated  by  Exhibits  A  and  B  filed  in  opposition  to  the \nmotion,  there  ere  genuine  issues  as  to  material  facts  and  plaintiffs, \ntherefore,  are  not  entitled  to  the grant  of  summary  judgment.  Defendant's \nmotion  to  dismiss  this  action,  which  vas  stayed  by  the  court's  order  of \nJune  19,  1967,  pending  a  disposition  of  the  companion  case,  should  now    \nbe  granted  for  the  added  reason  that  plaintiffs  have  chtained  all  the \nrelief  to  which  they  are  entitled  and  this  action  is  now  moot.  Defendant | \nfurther  contends  that  the  motion  to  add  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority  as \na  party  defendant  should  be  denied,  also  on  the  ground  of  mootness.  No \nobjection  is  made  to  the  withdrawal  of  plaintiffa'  motion  to  consolidate \nand  the  pending  motion  for  discovery. \nI.  Plaintiffsโ  motion  for summaryj  udgsmhoueldn bet de.nie d. \nA.  FUD's  actions  in  connection  with  the  Low-Rent  Housing  Prorram \nin  Chicago  do  not  implicate  the  Defendant  in  discriminatory \npractices  of  the  Chicero  Housing  Authority.  Plaintiffs' \nreliance  on  Burton  v.  Wilminston  Parking  Authority  and  Hicks \n  \nv.  Romeny  is  entirely  misplaced. \nPlaintiffsโ  complaint  seeks  a  declaration  that  the  Chicago  Housing \nAuthority  has  intentionally  discriminated  against  plaintiffs  on \nracial  grounds  in  site  and  tenant  selection  for  ite  lowerent  housing \nprojects,  contrary  to  the  Fifth  Amendaent  (Count  I)  and  Title  VI  of \nthe  Civil  Righte  Act  of  196;  (Count  Tl).  In  the  second  counts \nplaintiffs  merely  allese  that  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority  violated \nthe  Fifth  Amendment  (Count  III)  end  Title  VI  (Count  IV)  in  site \nselection  and  tenant  assignment;  no  allegation  is  included  that  the \nChicago  Housing  Authority  implewented  its  policies  with  respect \nto  site  selection  or  tenant  assignment  with  deliberate  intent  to \ndeprive  plaintiffs  of  their  rights.  It  would  appear  that  plaintiffs \nhave  ebvandonec  Counts  III  and  IV  because  no  argument  in  the  brief  is \naddressed  to  these  Counts. \nPlaintiffs  allieze  further  in  their  complaint  that  defendant \n  \nSecretary  \"assisted  in  carrying  out  and  continues  to  assist  in \ncarrying  out  a  recially  discriminatory  public  housing  system  in  the \nCity  of  Chicago.โ  They  demand  deciaratory  judgment  that  they  have \nthe  right  to  end  employment  of  Federal  funds  in  connection  with \nand  in  support  of  the  racially  discriminatory  aspects  of  the  public \nhousing  system  in  Chicago,  and  specifically  the  use  of  such  funds \nfor  the  construction  of  the  1965  and  1966  projects  of  the  CHA  on  sites \nwhich  have  been  selected  in  a  recially  discriminatory  manner  or  which\nwill  have  the  effect  of  strengthening  cr  continuing  existing \npatierns  of  Negro  residentisl  and  school  segregation  in  the \nCity  of  Chicago.  Plaintiffs  also  pray  for  โan  injunction against \nthe  Secretary  enjoining  him  from  making  financial  assistance \navatlable  to  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority  in  this  connection. \nRelying  on  these  allegations,  plaintiffs  build  an  oarguaent  to \nthe  effect  thet  HUD  has  discriminated  in  site  selection  and \ntenont  assigmaent  in  the  public  housing  progra  on  HUD's \n\"involvenent,  both  Mnsncial  and  aduinistrative  in  discrimina- \ntion  by  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority.\"  (Pl  Bre,  pe  32). \nPlaintiffs  do  not  alleve  and  do  not  contend  that  defendant \n   Celiberately  conspired  to  produce  discriminatory  practices  in \nthe  low-rent  housing  progrem  in  Chicago,  but  rather  talk \nvagucly  of  financial  and  acwinistrative  involvement  in  CHA's \ndeliterately  Ciscriminatery  acts. \nPlaintiffs  are  quite  frank  in  disclosing  thelr  purpose  in  rely- \ning  upon  a  hasy  concept  of  involvement.  At  pase  2  of  the  Brief \nplaintiffs  state: \n\"The  allegation  of  discriminstion  in  the  txo  complaints \nNo.  G7-Ce1l59  and  No.  G7-C~1);50)  sre  identical. \nLiability  of  HUD  is  prediceted  upon  its  being  a  โjoint \nparticipant!

Cone  Mem.  Hosp.,  323  Fe  2a  959  (1953)  and \nCoopar  ve  Aaron,  358  U.S.  1  (1958).  Obviously  pleintiffs  would\nforeclose  the  factual  issues  concerning  the  Secretary's  actions \nand  intentions  by  attributing  the  intentions  and  actions  of  CHA \nto  a  Secretary  because  of  HUD's  undisputed  financial  agsiastance \nto  CHA.  This  foreclosure  and  conclusion,  they  argue,  is  compelled \nas  a  matter  of  law  by  the  decisions  in  Vilmington,  Simnkins  and \nCooper. \nThese  cases  support  the  defendant's  position  rather  than  the \nplaintiffsโ.  In  the  Wilmington  case,  the  Supreme  Court  specifically \nlimited  its  holding  to  the  atatenent  that  when  a  State  agency \n  \nleases  public  property  in  the  manner  and  for  the  purpose  shown \nby  the  facts  in  that  case  the  lessee,  as  well  as  the  State,  must \ncomply  with  the  proscriptions  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  The \nSupreme  Court  was  careful  to  emphasize  the  importance  cf  the \nfacts  in  that  caze,  โOnly  by  sifting  facts  and  weighing  the \ncircumstances  can  the  nonobvisus  involvement  of  the  State  in \nprivate  conduct  be  attributed  its  true  significance.\"  365  U.S. \n715,722.  Based  on  the  specific  facts  in  thst  case,  the  court \nfound  that  โThe  State  has  so  far  insinuated  itself  into  a  position \nof  interdependence  witiiflessee/  that  it  must  be  recognized  as  a \njoint  participant  in  the  challenzed  activity...\"  at  p.  725. \nHowever,  the  court  warned  that  \"the  conclusions  drawn  from  the \nfacts  and  circumstances  of  this  record  are  by  no  means  declared \nas  universal  truths  on  the  basis  of  which  every  state  leasing \nagreement  is  to  be  tested.\"  Ibid.  It  is  clear  that  Wilmington \nargues  against  summary  judgment  in  this  case,  where  no  such  facts \nexist  and  no  such  relationship  ef  interdependence  between  the \nSecretary  and  the  CHA  has  been  established.\nCooper,  also  relied  upon,  is  even  further  removed  fron \nrecognizing  financial  assistance  to  a  discriminating  party, \nstanding  alone,  as  sufficient  to  support  a  judgment  against  the \nFederal  Governnent  or  any  of  its  officers  under  the  Fifth \nAmendment.  Pects  must  be  proved  before  the  governments,  State \nor  Federal,  can  be  held  by  a  jucguent  to  have  committed  such  a \ngrave  effense  as  deprivation  of  Constitutional  rights.  And  this, \nwe  subnit,  is  in  full  accord  with  the  basic  jurisprudential \nprinciple  of  due  precess  for  all  likigants,  private  or  public. \nHale  ve  Finch,  10h  U.S.  261  (1881);  Old  Dominion  Copver  Mine  & \nSmelting  Co.  v.

The  Simokins  court  also  relied  upon  end  emphasised \nthe  necessity  of  facts.  In  that  suit,  ll-Burten  Act  finds \nadainistered  by  the  Department  of  Health,  Education  and  Welfare, \nWare  channelled  through  the  State  to  private  hospitels.

Summary  judement  is \nrarely,  if  ever,  appropriate  where,  as  here,  motive  and \nintent  are  important  to  a  resolution  of  the  issues  and \nnever  where,  as  here,  serious  questions  of  fact  remain \nunresolved,  as,  for  example,  the  racial  composition  of \nthe  neighborhoods  involved.  For  these  reasons, \ndefendents'  motion  for  summary  judement  is  denied.\" \n{citations  and  footnotes  omitted.) \nBe  There  are  penuine  issues  of  material  fact  unresolved.  HUD  has \nnot participated  in  and  has  not  condoned  discrimination  by  CHA, \nThere  are  no  facts  before  this  Court  clearly  entitling  plaintiffs \nto  Summary  judsement,  and  there  is  a  clear  showing  of  genuine \nissues  of  material  facts  unresolved.  Indeed,  the  face  of  the \nopinion  rendered  February  7,  1969,  in  No.  67-C-1459,  which  plein-  | \ntiffs  would  use  to  postulate  HUD's  discriminatory  actions,  con- \ntains  a  factual.  finding  which  in  itself  contradicts  plaintiffsโ \nClaim  of  entitlenent  to  summary  judpment.  In  the  opinion,  this \n  \nCourt  found  that  HUD,  in  1963,  prior  to  enactment  of  the  Civil \nRights  Act  of  1954,  compelled  CHA  to  abandon  its  โproximity  rule\", \ndesigned  to  limit  occupancy  in  certain  proposed  new  elderly \nprojects  to  whites,  by  giving  preference  in  occupancy  to  area \nresidents,  by  informing  CHA  that  unless  the  rule  was  revoked, \nHUD,  under  Executive  Order  11063,  would  not  approve  the  sites \nlocated  in  the  areas  of  white  concentration.  Furthermore,  the \ndepositions  of  Marie  C.  McGuire  and  Joseph  Burstein,  taken  by \nplaintiffs  by  order  of  this  Court  in  No.  67-C-1459,  clearly \nestablish  that  before  the  1964  Civil  Rights  Act,  and  continuing\nto  the  date  of  the  depositions,  March  25,  1968,  rather  then \nadding and  ebetting  CHA  in  its  discriminatory  actions,  HUD \nwas  moving  affirmatively  to  block  such  actions.  Plaintiffs \nhave  not  seen  fit  to  file  these  depositions  with  this  Court  in \nNo.  67-C-1459,.  Defendant's  counsel  has  procured  a  transcript \nthereof  which  is  attached  hereto  as  an  exhibit,  and  will  ask' \nthe  reporter  to  file  the  original  with  the  sey \nThe  affidavits  attached  hereto  set  forth  other  actions \nof  HUD  over  the  period  of  time  covered  by  this  Complaint,  and \ndisclose  the  collection  of  additional  facts,  contradicting  any \ndiscriminatory  intent  of  the  Secretary  and  participation  by  him \nin  CHA  discrimination,  deliberate  or  otherwise.  Substantial \nissues  of  fact  precluding  summary  judement  exist  in  this  matter. \nSimler  v.  Conner,  372  U.S.  221  (1963);  Fountain v.  Filson, \n  \n336  U.S.  681  (1949). \n  \ni/  Those  depositions  of  Government  exployees,  taken  upon  request \nof  these  plaintiffs  in  Washington were  attended  by  counsel  for \nthe  Government  as  well  as  by  attorneys  for  plaintiffs  ond  C.H.A, \nAlthough  taken  in  67  C  1459,  the  same  rights  of  direct  and  cross \nexamination  were  enjoyed  by  the  parties  that  would  apply  to  a \ndeposition  in  this  case.\n10 \nCe  Eilo's  financiesl  end  administrative  involvement  in  CHA's  prorran \nis  limited. \nSince  the  entry  of  this  Court's  decree  of  July  1,  1969,  HUD  hase \nnot  entered  into  eny  financial  comaitments  to  make  losns  or  annual \ncontributions  for  the  planning,  development  or  acquisition  of  lowe \nrent  public  housing  units  in  the  City  of  Chicago.  However,  it  did \nissue  a  Program  Reservation  for  3000  units  to  the  Chicago  Housing \nAuthority  on  September  8,  1969.  (A  Prograa  Reservetion  merely \nsets  aside  or  carmarks  a  certain  nunber  of  units  for  e  specific \nhousing  euthority  from  HUD's  nationwide  authorization  and  is  in \nno  sense  an  widertaking  to  provide  monies).  It  follows,  therefore, \nthat  aside  from  projects  in  pre-construction  and  construction, \n  \nwhich  are  subject  to  the  Court's  order  in  Ho.  67-Ce1l59,  HUD's \npresent  financial  involvement  in  lowerent  housing  in  Chicago \nconsists  entirely  of  annual  contributions,  pursuant  to  contract, \npayable  generally  over  a  period  of  LO  years  from  the  date  of  the \ncontract  to  assist  in  the  repayment  of  the  bonds  issued  by  the \nAuthority  to  finance  the  capital  cost  of  the  projects. \nThe  bonds  are  indeed  secured  by  an  undertaking  by  HUD,  pursuant \nto  Section  10  and  22  of  the  USHAct  and  the  Annual  Contributions \nContract,  guarantecing  to  make  peyments  of  armual  contributions  in \nan  anourt  sufficient,  together  with  revenues  from  the  project,  te \npey  principal  and  interest  on  the  bonds  to  maturity.  Further,  the \nfull  faith  and  credit  of  the  United  States  is  pledged  to  the \nmaking  of  those  peyments  (Defendant's  Memorandwa  in  Support  of\nil \nMotion  to  Dismiss,  p.  3).  Hence,  the  only  \"financial  invelvenent\" \nof  HUD  results  from  disbursesents  of  annual  contributions \npursuant  to  solemn  contractual,  obligations  of  the  United  States, \nwhich  obligetions  ere  further  secured  by  a  pledee  of  the  full \nfaith  end  credit  of  the  United  States  (Defendant's  Memorsndum  in \nSupport  of  Motion  te  Dismiss,  pe  3). \nHUD's  administrative  invelvement,  according  to  the  plaintiffs, \nextends  to  almost  every  aspect  of  CHA's  operation  including  site \nselection  (Plaintiffs!  brief,  pe  32).  The  fact  is,  however,  that \nsection  1  of  the  USHAct  declares  thea  policy  of  the  United  States \nto  vest  in  the  Authority  the  meximua  anount  of  responsibility  in \nthe  administration  of  the  lowerent  housing  program.  The  selection \n  \nof  sites  is,  and  has  been  since  the  inception  of  the  progrsen, \nexclusively  a  local  function.  Nor  does  the  fact  that  HUD  has \nestablished  site  eclecticn  criteria,  and  reserves  the  right  to \napprove  each  site  selected  based  upon  conformity  to  those  critertla, \nconverts  the  power  of  selection  from  ae  local  to  a  federal  function. \nThe  legislative  history  of  the  United  States  Housing  Act  of  1937 \nend  particulerly  of  the  policy  statement  in  Section  1  make  it \nexphatically  clear  that  the  principeli  reasons  for  tha  approval \npower  in  HUD  are  (1)  to  assure  solvancy  of  the  projects;  (2)  te \nessure  their  continued  lowerent  character,  which  is  necessary  to \nprotect  the  exemption  of  the  projects  from  state  end  local  taxes; \nand  (3)  to  essure  economy  in  development  and  operation  of  the\n12 \nprojects.  In  the  case  of  site  selection  criteria,  the  mandate  to \nimplement  Executive  Order  11053  and  Title  VI  of  the  Civil.  Rights \ndet  of  196)  affords  yet  another  basis  in  law  for  the  adoption  of \nsite  selection  criteria  by  HUD.  A  chronological  comilation  of \nthe  site  selection  criteria  for  low-rent  housing  projects,  showing \nthe  relationship  to  the  factors  of  economy  and  efficiency, \ntegether  with  the  factors  inherent  in  the  term  \"Lowerent  housing \ncharacter,\"  is  attached  as  Exhibit  C. \nfhe  promulgation  of  Executive  Order  11063  in  November  1962  led  to \nthe  revision  of  the  criteria  which  was  released  in  Septeaber  1963. \nThis  revision,  for  the  first  time,  incorporates  a  mondatory  pro- \nvision  requiring  nondiscrimination  in  site  eelection.  The  later \n  \nstatutory  prohibitions  of  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Aichts  Act  of  196h \ncaused  further  revision  of  slte  criteria  in  Septeader  1965.  These \nwere  supplemental  to  the  HUD  Perulations  adopted  by  the  Secretary \nafter  approval  by  the  President.  โThe  subsequent  revisions  and \nrefinements  of  site  selection  criteria  reflect  HUD's  response  and \nadaptation  in  the  light  of  experience  gained  under  the  cperation \nof  ths  criteria.  Notably  in  the  revision  released  February  1967, \nHUD  vesponded  to  applications  for  projects  which,  as  a  whole,  were \nweighted  on  the  side  of  a  predominance  of  sites  in  areas  of \nminority  group  concentration.  The  revision  released  in  August \n1958,  formalising  earlier  Circulers,  was  aimed  at  situations  where \nthe  paucity  ef  sites  in  areas  of  other  than  minority  group  concen- \ntration  was  due  to  the  requirements.  of  local  law,  euch  as  zoning \nrestrictions  or  the  need  for  approvals  by  local  bodies.\n13 \nThose  regulations  were  further  implemented  with  Handbock  regue- \nlations  that  were  not  published  in  the  Federal  Register,  The  fact \nthat  HUD  evaluated  the  sites  selected  by  the  Authority  in  terms  of \nthose  criteria  scarcely  compels  a  finding  that  HUD's  โinvolvementโ \nin  the  site  selection  process  was  somehow  unlawful;  rather  it  evidences \n@  commendable  concern  for  the  exercise  of  its  approval  power  in  a \nmenner  compatible  with  the  requirements  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964, \nAs  for  HUD's  awareness  of  the  resistance  on  the  part  of  the  City \nCouncil  to  sites  outside  of  Negro  areas  (Plaintiffs'  brief,  p.  32), \nwhat  plaintiffs  neglect  to  edd  is  that  HUD  made  strenuous  efforts  to \ninduce  the  Authority  to  come  forth  with  sites  that  would  produce  a \nmore  balanced  program. \nOne  of  these  efforts,  in  connection  with  the  sites  for  CHA's  proposed \n1966  projects,  is  referred  to  in  the  Deposition  of  Joseph  Burstein,  at \n  \npages  100-108.  The  Deposition  also  reveals  (pp.  99-100)  that  HUD  made \ndiligent  efforts,  ond  indeed  retained  a  private  firm,  to  obtain  precise \ndemographic  information  concerning  the  City  of  Chicego  so  that HUD could \nmake  a  more  informed  review  of  the  sites  selected  by  the  Chicago  Housing \nAuthority.  Further,  the  decision  was  made  to  reject  many  of  the  1966 \nsites  if  not  withdrawn  (as  they  ultimately  were)  by  C.H.A.  These  sites \nwere  rejected  for  the  very  factors  complained  of  by  these  plaintiffs  -- \nhigh  concentration  of  public  housing  in  the  black  community.  (Burstein \ndeposition  pp.  99-105}  Servaites'  effidavit  attached  to  Reply  in  support \nof  Motion  to  Dismiss) \nFeced  with  the  guugh  dilemma  of  accepting  some  other  sites  proposed \nby  the  Authority  that  were  believed  to  be  leawful  but  not  optimal,  or\n337A \nrejecting  those  sites  and  depriving  potential  public  housing  tenenats \nof  improved  shelter,  HUD  chose  the  former  alternative.  If  mere \nknowledge  of  the  City's  intention  to  resist  desegregation  implicates \nHUD,  then  the  policeman  is  indeed  implicated  in  the  nefarious \nactivities  of  those  he  pursues.\n  \nLh \nThe  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  HUD  is  punetillious  in  requiring \nthet  facilities  provided  with  federal  financial  assistance  shall \nbe  operated  without  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  color, \nor  national  origin.  Thus,  for  exemple,  in  the  urban  renewal \nprogram  @  developer  who  leases  or  purchases  Land  in  an  urban \nrenewal  project  area  mist  accept  &  covenant  in  the  deed  by \nwhich  he  undertakes  himself  not  to  discriminate,  but  also  to \nassure  that  there  will  be  no  discrimination  in  the  operation \nand  use  of  any  portion  of  the  redeveloped  structure.  In  the \nlow=-rent  housing  program,  the  same  objective  is  scught  to  be \naccomplished  by  provision  for  nondlscrimination  in  employment \nby  the  Authorities,  by  tenant  assignment  plans,  and  by \nregulations  as  to  oecupancy.  Whatever  deficiencies  they  may \nhave  in  terms  of  the  objective  of  providing  expanded  housing \nchoices  for  minority  groun  members,  they  constitute  some \nevidence  of  continuous  activity  on  the  part  of  HUD  to  preclude \nthe  kind  of  discrimination  that  was  held  to  be  state  action  in \nBurton  v.  Wilmington  Housing  Authority. \na  fate  2  a \n \ns\ni\ne\nDe  The  Entry  of  Judgment  Against  the  Defendant  would  have  Disastrous \nConsequences  for  the  lowerent  prorran  throurshout  the  country. \nPlaintiffs  seek  ae  judgement  against  the  Secretary  because  of  HUD's \nfinancial  and  administrative  \"involvement\"  in  discrimination  by  | \nthe  Chicago  Housing  Authority.  HUD  deals  with  the  Housing\ni \n15 \nAuthority  at  arm's  Length;  its  relationship  to  the  Housing \nAuthority  is  defined  by  a  meticulously  drawn  contract;  and \nthe  rights  and  duties  of  the  respective  parties  to  the \ncontract  are  clearly  set  forth.  In  the  realm  of  site \nselection,  &s  we  have  seen,  it  is  for  the  Housing  Authority \nto  initiete  and  select,  and  HUD  to  approve  or  disapprove.  This \nis  Congressional  policy,  clearly  set  forth  in  the  Act,  and  we \nsubmit  that  it  represents  sound  policy.  Nothing  would  be  more \ncatastrophic  than  to  have  the  Federal  Governnent  dictate  the \nSites  for  low-rent  public  housing  in  the  freas  covered  by  the \nmore  than  2500  housing  Guthorities  presentiy  in  the  progran. \nWe  have  argued  that  failure  to  continue  the  disbursement  of \nannual  contributions  to  the  Authority  would  necessitate \nrepudiation  by  the  United  States  of  2  contract  obligation  that \nwas,  with  respect  to  each  project,  lawful  when  made.  It \nstretches  credulity  that  plaintiffs  should  ask  this  court  to \nterminate  a  solemn  obligation  of  the  United  States  to  the \nperformance  of  which  the  full  faith  and  credit  of  the  United \nStates  is  pledsed.  And  yet  that  is  precisely  the  relicf  that \nplaintiffs  demand.  The  senna  prayer  for  relief  on  e&ch  count \nin  the  Complaint  calls  upon  the  court  โafter  a  full  hearing  *  #  # \n{to]  permanently  enjoin  the  defendant  from  making  availeble  to \nthe  Authority  any  Federal  financial  assistance  to  be  used  in \nconnection  with  or  in  support  of  the  racially  discrininstory \naspects  of  the  public  housing  system  within  the  City  of\n16 \nChicago  *  *  #,.\"  Jf  by  that  prayer,  plaintiffs  seek  to  have \nthe  United  States  dishonor  the  pledge  of  its  full  feith  and \neredit  to  the  discharge  of  its  contract  obligations \n(supra,  p.  ),  it  is  well  that  the  consequences  of  such  an \naction  be  known. \nThe  Housing  Authorities  of  the  country  sre  currently  marketing \nan  averace  monthly  total  of  approximately  4290,090,090  in \nshort  term  securities  called  project  notes.  Those  sales  are \nmade  to  cbhtain  working  capital  for  the  construction  of  Lowerent \nhousing  projects.  The  anounts  end  results  of  competitive \nbids  for  those  notes  over  the  last  12  momths  period  are \nreflected  in  Exhibit  b.  Bonds  employed  to  obtain  funaus  for \ntne  retirement  of  project  nobes  and  peruanent  financing  of  the \ncosts  of  construction  or  acquisition  of  low-rent  housing \nprojects  are  being  marketed  generally  four  times  per  year, \nwith  the  total  amount  marketed  in  1968-1969  exceeding \n$1,000,000,000.  The  amount  and  the  results  of  competitive \nbids  for  those  bonds  over  the  last  two  years  are  reflected \nin  Exhibit  E. \nThe  sad  truth  is  that  any  injunction  based  upon  the \nadministration  by  MUD  of  the  federally  assisted  Low-rent \nhousing  program  has  an  immediate  end  an  escalating  effect \nupon  the  cost  of  money  for  the  entire  program  and  tends  to \nreduce  the  number  of  units  that  can  be  produced  with  any\nc \nLY \ngiven  volune  of  amual  contributions,  if,  indeed,  such \ninjunction  did  not  result  in  halting  financing  on  the  private \nmarket  altogether,  because  of  the  forced  default  in  the \nsecurity  backing  these  issuances.  The  cost  to  the  program \ncurrently  of  &  50  point  (one  half  of  one  percent)  increase \nin  the  rate  for  short  term  funds  amounts  to  millions  of \ndollars  per  annum.  The  cost  of  &  similar  inerease  in  the \nrate  for  lone-term  funds  is  even  more  excessive.  Both \ncomparisons  appear  on ExhibitsD.โ Clearly  the  Court  cannot \nacquiesce  in  plaintiffsโ  prayer  for  relief  without  repudlating \nthe  full  faith  and  credit  of  the  United  States,  without \nirreparable  damave  to  the  continued  provision  of  Low-rent \nhousing  for  the  poor,  and  without  incalculable  harm  to  the \nvery  class  of  percons  these  plaintiffs  represent.

Chicers  Housing  Authority: \n  \n\"In  addition  to  the  uncertainty  of  whether  PHA \nwould  hold  it  approprinte  to  deny  funds  under \nthe  facts  as  they  are  now  known,  it  is  not  cleer \nwhether  even  a  temnorary  denial  of  federal  funis \nwould  not  inoede  the  development  of  public  housing \nand  thus  danase  the  very  persons  this  suit  was \nbrought  to  protect.\"  (2%  I.Scupp.  997,  915) \n|\n13 \nThe  Court  might  well  have  included  in  that  thought  a \nrecognition  that  a  deniel  of  funds  anywhere  impedes  the \ndevelopment  of  public  housing  everywhere,  and  damages  poor \npeople  in  need  of  public  housing  throughout  the  country. \nEe  The  Entry  of  Judement  Against  the  Defendant  would  have \nDisastrous  Consequences  for  the  Administration  of  the  Housing \nTitles  of  the  Civil  Rishts  Acts  of  1964  and  1968, \nTitle  VIII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1965  prescribes  the \npolicy  of  the  United  States  \"to  provide,  within  constitutional \nlimitations,  for  fair  housing  throughout  the  United  States\" \n(42  U.S.C.  ยง3691).  โThe  Act  provides  that  โthe  authority  and \nresponsibility  for  administering  this  Act  shall  be  in  the \nSecretary  of  Housing  and  Urban  Developmentโ  (he  U.S.C.  $3601). \nIt  also  directs  that  โall  executive  departments  and  acenctes \nshall  adainister  ae  and  activities  relating  to \nhousing  and  urban  development  in  4&  manner  affirnatively  to \nfurther  the  purposes  of  this  title  and  shall  cooperate  with \n  \nthe  Secretary  to  further  such  purposesโ  (42  U.S.C.  ยง360i(a)), \n{Underscoring  ours}. \nThe  Secretary  is  directed  to  make  studies  of  discrininatory \nhousing  practices;  to  publish  and  disseminate  the  reports, \nrecommendations  and  information  derived  from  such  studies;\n19 \nand  to  cooperate  with  public  and  private  bodies  formulsting \nor  conducting  prograns  to  prevent  or  eliminate  discriminatory \nhousiag  practices,  including  the  Community  Reletions  Service \n(h2  U.S.C.  ยง3608(4)).  The  Secretary  is  specifically  enjoined \nto  โadminister  the  provrams  and  activities  relating to  housing \nand  urban  develomnent  in  @  manner  affiraatively  to  further \nthe  policies  of  this  title.โ  (2  u.S.c.  ยง3601(a)).  [Underscoring \nours].  The  Secretary  is  given  broad  powers  of  investigation, \neducation  and  conciliation,  as  well  as  quasi-judicial  enforcement \npowers.  (42  U.S.C.  ยง3699). \nTitle  VI  of  the  earlier  Civil  Rights  Act  of  195)  was  addressed \nto  the  problem  of  discrimination  in  programs  or  activities \nreceiving  Federal  finsncial  assistance.  Although  the  President \nplaced  the  power  to  coordinate  enforcement  of  Title  VI  in  the \nAttorney  General  (ixecutive  Order  1126,  30  F.R.  12327, \nSeptember  23,  1965),  it  is  clear  that  the  Secretary  of  HUD \nhas  the  daninant  role  in  effectuating  the  policy  of  the  Act \nes  it  relates  to  federally  assisted  housing.  โThe  site  selection \ncriteria  that  govern  the  evaluation  of  specific  proposals \nreceived  from  local  housing  authorities  implement  the  more \ngeneralized  prohibitions  upon  discrimination  in  determining  the \nleeation  of  housing,  that  were  adopted  by  the  defendant  with \nthe  approval  of  the  President  (2h  CFR  Part  1).  Those  regulations\n<0 \nserve  to  inplement  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  as  do  the \ncriteria  for  local  regulations  governing  tenant  selection \nand  continued  occupancy. \nIt  would  be  anomalous  in  the  extreme  for  this  Court  to  conclude \nthat  it  has  the  necessary  authority  to  wrest  control  of  these \nvast  civil  rights  responsibilities  from  the  Secretary  based \nupon  contested  approval  actions  extending  back  over  two  decades. \nThe  Congress  has  entrusted  the  defendant  with  responsibility \nfor  assuring  fair  housing  throughout  the  United  States.  He \nwill  be  called  to  account  by  the  Congress  for  ony  derelictions \nin  the  discharge  of  that  responsibility.  Plaintiffs  do  not \ncontend  that  defendent  deliberately  conspired  to  produce \ndtecrininatoes  houcine  in  the  City  of  Chicago.  They  talk \nvaguely  of  his  finenciel  and  administrative  involvement  in  the \ndiscriminatory  site  selection  of  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority \n(supra,  p.  ).  This  Court's  decree  of  July  1,  1969  establishes \na  fremework  for  eliminating  the  emsequences  of  past \ndiscrimination  by  the  Authority.  HID  has  undertaken  to  cooperate \nin  the  achlevement  of  the  objectives  of  that  decree,  and  the \nSecretary  is  pursuipy  &  number  of  avenues  toward  that  end \ne\nf\n(Exhibit  G). \n .\n20-A \nAttached  hereto  as  exhibits  to  this  brief  are  an  effidavit \nby  Don  Morrow,  H.U.D.  Deputy  Regional  Administrator  for  this  srea \n(Exhibit  G)  and  a  copy  of  the  Government  Memorandum  filed  by  us \nin  the  companion  case  brought  by  these  plaintiffs  against  C.H.A. \n(No.  66  โฌ  1459).  โThese  documents  reflect  some  of  the  undertakings \nby  H.U.D.  in  cooperation  with  the  decree  of  this  Court  against \nC.H.A.  in  that  companion  case. \nThe  Government  Memorandum  filed  in  No.  66  C  1459  was  more  than \na  statement  of  legal  position  in  a  case;  it  was  a  statement  of  policy \njointly  expressed  by  both  the  Department  of  Justice  and  H.U.D., \n   presented  in  response  to  the  Court's  request  for  views  of  the  Govern- \nment.  That  statement  expressed  support  for  the  objectives  previously \nset  forth  by  the  Court  in  its  earlier  opinion  in  that  case;  endorsed \nthe  Court's  view  that  specific  criteria  were  required  in  the  final \ndecree  to  be  entered  instead  of  a  generalized  order;  and  supported \nmany  of  the  specific  provisions  ultimately  entered  by  the  Court, \nwhile  suggesting  Modification  of  a  few.  H.U.D.  then  went  on  volun- \ntarily  to  undertake  certain  affirmative  actions  in  aid  of  the  Court's \nobjectives: \n1.  To  pay  for  a  survey  to  locate  availsble  and  suitable \nsites. \n2.  To  fund  activities  to  modernize  existing  public  housing \nso  as  to  make  that  housing  located  in  the  \"Limited\" \narea  ag  desirable  and  well-serviced  as  possible.\n20-8 \n3.

In  considerable  detail,  that  affidavit  sets \n   forth  H.U.D.  program  reservations  for  C.H.A,.  and  Cook  County  Housing \nAuthority,  authorization  of  modernization  mds  to  C.H.A.,  use  of  the \n23(g)  leasing  program,  and  financing  of  a  site  selection  survey  in- \ncluding  ell  of  Cook  County  end  parts  of  other  adjacent  counties.  โThe \naffidavit  also  describes  the  many  other  efforts  of  H.U.D.  to  edvance \nthe  purposes  of  desegregation  and  production  of  low-income  housing. \nWe  invite  the  Court's  attention  to  that  most  simnificant  statement. \nTogether  with  the  other  attachments  hereto,  it  demonstrates  clearly \nthe  defendant's  committment  to  and  voluntary  action  in  support  of \nthe  objectives  of  the  Court  decree  against  C.H.A,.\n2k \nThe  determination  of  which  powers  and  programs  to  bring  to  bear  upon \nthe  admittedly  unsatisfactory  housing  situation  in  the  City  of  Chicago \nbelongs  to  the  defendant.  โThe  determination  of  when,  where,  how,  and \nin  what  emounts  to  commit  Federal  funds  is  a  discretionary  determina- \ntion  that  belongs  to  the  Executive  officer  empowered  by  statute  to \nmake  it.  It  is  not  subject  to  direction  by  the  judiciary.  American \nTrucking  Assn.  v.  U. S.,  344  U.S,  298;  Railroad  Comm.  v.  Rowan  & \nN.  Oil  Co.,  310  U.S.  573;  Kelly  v.

(See  also  discussion  in \nregard  to  Motion  of  Defendant  to  Dismiss.) \nMoreover,  the  assumption  of  that  authority  by  judicial  decree, \npredicated  upon  a  finding  that  defendant  has  been  โinvolvedโ  in \n  \ndiscriminatory  housing  practices  must  necessarily  undermine  the \nSecretary's  activities  in  the  civil  rights  area  as  well  as  in  the \nedministration  of  the  housing  programe  of  the  nation.  He  would \nlos}  all  credence  as  the  administering  and  enforcing  agent  of  the \nCivil  Rights  Act  of  1968,  and  his  efforts  to  enforce  the  1964  Act \nwould  be  ridiculed  as  the  efforts  of  a  law  violator  to  compel  others \nto  obey  the  law. \nSurely,  whatever  the  record  of  Federal  โinvolvementโ  in  discrimina~ \ntion  by  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority,  the  time  has  not  yet  arrived  for \na  Court  to  conclude  that  the  defendant  has  been  so  derelict  in  discharging\n mr DP\nhis  responsibilities  under  the  Civil  Rights  Act  that  he  mist  be \nmade  to  operate  within  the  confines  of  judicial  decrees. \nFe  The  Plaintiff's  Chijiectives  Will  Be  More  Readily  Achieved  By  The \nVoluntary  (Lrforts  Of  The  Defendant  Than  By  โSihe  Coercion  Of  A \ndudicial  Decree. \nPlaintiffs'  Brief  discloses  what  is  not  at  all  apparent  from  the \nprayers  of  their  Complaint.  They  appear  to  have  abandoned  their \nclaim  to  a  termination  of  Federal  financial  assistance  for  the  pro- \ngram  in  Chicago,  and  seek  instead  to  plow  new  ground  by  way  of  โsuch \nother  and  further  relief  es  the  Court  my  deem  just  and  equitableโ \n(Plaintiffs'  Brief,  p.  347). \nThey  proceed  from  the  premise  that,  under  the  Opinion  of  this  Court \n  \nin  the  companion  suit  (255  FP.  Supp.  907,  91h)  they  โare  entitled \nto  the  formulation  of  a  cosiprehensive  plan  to  remedy  the  past  effecta \nof  unconstitutional  sites  in  Chicago's  public  housing  program.โ  Since \nexisting  structures  cannot  be  relocated  to  other  sites,  the  Court's \ndecree  addresses  itself  to  the  location  ef  future  dwelling  units.  โThe \nspeed  and  scope  of  the  remedy,  they  conclude,  depends  upon  how  many  and \nhow  rapidly  new  units  are  supplied. \nPlaintiffs  then  state  categorically  that  \"a  second  major  element  of \ntruly  effective  relief  will  be  the  ability  to  utilize  eress  beyond  the \ngeographic  boundaries  of  the  City  of  Chicago\"  (PL.  Br.  pe  35).  Full \nrelief,  they  contend,  requires  an  order  egainst  HUD  because  1)  only \nHUD  โcan  assure  that  full  sdventage  will  be  taken  of  opportunities  to \nimplement  the  Court's  judgment  order  outside  the  City,โ  and  2)  HUD\n23 \nโplays  at  least  as  important  a  role  as  CHA  in  determining  what  the \nproduction  and  therefore  the  supply  of  future  Dwelling  Units  will \nbe\"  (PL.  Bre,  pยป  36),  Therefore,  plaintiffs  conclude,  the  Court \nshould  enter  an  order  directing  HUD  โto  do  everything  which  may \nappropriatelbye   done\"  to  provide  plaintiffs  with  speedy  and \neffective  relief.  Somewhat  coyly,  they  suggest  that  the  Court  invite \nHUD  to  propose  the  form  of  an  order, \nThe  Brief  Amicus  filed  by  The  Lawyers  Comsittee  for  Civil  Richts \nand  others  is  seareely  less  coy  in  Cisclosing  proposals  far  solving \nthe  housing  problems  of  the  City  of  Chicago.  \"At  this  stage  of  the \nproceedinzs,\"  it  says,  \"it  would  be  premature  for  petitioners  to \nsugsest  the  total  nature  of  the  action  HUD  micht  teke  in  the  eircum \nstances  of  this  caseโ  (p.  11). \n    \nHowever,  as  a  first  bite,  the  Prief  would  have  HUD  employ  to  better \nadvantage  FHA  foreclosed  housing,  221(a)(3)  moderate  income  housing \nwith  rentals  reduced  to  public  housing  levels  by  rent  supplements, \n235  housing  for  lower-income  families  with  rentals  similarly  reduced \nto  public  housing  levels  by  the  use  cf  rent  supplements,  235  sales \nhousing  for  lower-incoms  families,  and  231  housing  for  the  elderly \nfurther  subsidized  by  rent  supplements.  These  programs  are  said \nto  be  illustrative  rather  than  exhaustive  and  are  somehow  to  be \nemployed  throughout  the  six-county  metropolitan  area  of  Chicago.\n2h, \nIn  short,  these  proposala  suggest  the  usurpation  of  the  functions \nof  the  Executive  Department  by  the  Judiciary.  The  isaguance  of  a \ndecree  of  this  nature  would  not  insure  housing  activities  in  the \nChicago  market  beneficial  to  these  plaintiffs  ยซ-  it  would \nparalyze  them!  Moreover,  the  vehicles  which  are  suggested  do  not \nserve  the  income  group  of  which  these  plaintiffs  are  a  part.  The \nincome  groups  which  all  HUD  housing  programs  other  than-the  Lowe \nrent  housing  program  under  the  United  States  Housing  Act  of  1937 \nserve  are,  by  statute,  above  the  maximum  income  limits  for \nadnission  to  lowerent  housing.  All  but  a  few  families  in  continued \noccupanciyn   Llow-rent  housing  at  or  near  maximum  income  limits  for \n  \nsuch  occupancy  are  unable  to  afford  to  live  in  housing  produced \nundex  these  other  programs. \nFurther,  Congressional  appropriation  for  thase. programs  serving \nthis  mininal  overlap  of  income  groups  are  limited.  The  total \ndollar  amount  of  rent  eupplenent  contracta  authorized  for  the \nfiscal  year  1970  is  $50,000,000.  Who  shall  decide  how  much  of  that \ntotal  will  be  allocated  to  the  Chicero  metropolitan  area?  Do  the \nplaintiffs  propose  that  the  allocation  be  accomplished  by  judicial \ndecree?  And  when  the  courts  of  the  nation  hasten  to  enter  similar \nGecrees  in  order  to  protect  the  allocations  that  would  ctherwise \novtain  for  their  conmnunities,  will  the  law  establish  an  order  of \npriority  based  upon  the  date  of  entry  of  the  decree? \nThese  proposals  are  attempts  by  the  plaintiffs  to  impose  upon \nthe  nation  their  own  views  of  how  the  enormously  complicated \n|\n \na\n25 \nproblems  of  achieving  fair  housing  shall  be  tackled.  Almost \nheediess  of  the  consequences,  they  seek  to  direct  the  Secretary \nin  the  administration  of  his  vast  powere  and  in  the  expenditure \nof  the  vast  sums  and  the  vast  spending  authority  pleced  in  his \n  \nรฉiscretion  by  the  Congress  and  the  President.  Relief  of  that \nnature,  however  well  motivated,  is  barred  as  a  matter  of  law. \nIn  support  of  its  unprecedented  prayer  for  relief,  plaintiff  end \nthe  briefs  amici  cite  the  voting  rights  case  of  Louisiana  v.  U.S., \n  \n380  U.S.  145,  (1965).  Although  the  quoted  portion  of  that  case \nreferred  to  in  plaintiffs'  brief  (at  yp.  34)  eppears  to  give  a \ncourt  enormous  equitable  powere  to  โeliminate  the  discriminatory \neffects  of  the  past  as  well  as  bar  like  discrimination  in  thea \nfuture.\"  (p.  154  of  380  U.S.),  the  decree  of  the  District  Court \n   actually  did  mo  more  than  enjoin  the  state  from  further  use  of  its \nvoter  interpretstion  test  and  order  voter  registration  requirements \nโfrozenโ  in  order  to  obviate  the  effect  of  prior  diseriminatory \napplication, \nThe  relief  decreed  in  Louisiana  v.  UB,  and  that  sought  in  the \npresent  case  are  in  no  way  anslogous:  โFreezingโ  or  preventing \nthe  implementation  of  a  rroposed  governnent  program  is  considerably \neifferent  from  demanding  that  HUD  affirmatively  create  a  compre+ยซ \n  \nhensive  housing  plan  for  low  and  moderate  income  people  for  the \nentire  Chicago  metropolitan  area.\n26 \nLouisiana  v.  U.S.,  along  with  several  other  civil  rights  cases, \nwas ciitn Jeackdson  ve  Godwin,  400  F.  2d  529  (1958)  to demon~ \nstrate  the  kinds  of  relief  that  hed  been  granted  to  ber  future \ndiscrimination.  None  of  the  cases  compelled  affirmative  official \nection;  each  decree  merely  restrained  the  iuplementation  of  an \nestablished  state  rule  or  regulation  (pp.  539-510  of  00  F.  2d \nfor  cases). โ \nfhe  anlcus  alco  cite  tim  school  desegregation  ceses  in  support \nof  their  theory  for  relief.  Both  cases  merely  reaffirmed  a  long \nstending  principle  that  the  court  and  not  HiW  hes  the  sole \nresponsibility  of  determining  proper  standards  of  constitutional \nprotection.  HEW  stendards  serve  as  a  helpful  but  not  necessarily \n  \nbinding  freneworks  to  bs  ueed  by  boih  the  courts  and  scheol \nCistricts  in  framins  eccepteble  plans.  Thoy  sorve  as  a  broad \nNetlion-wide  guidspest  to  ald  lecal  school.  districts  te  fashion \ntheir  own  individual.  pleanse  It  in  no  wey  functions  as  a  comre- \nhensive  plan  regarding  the  acdainistration  of  future  HEW  pregranus. \nIn  ehort,  none  of  the  cases  relied  won  by  plaintiffs  or  the \nbriefs  salcua  furnishes  the  slirhtest  legal  basis  for  this \nextracrdinary  relief. \nEqually  ixportant  to  recognize  is  that  the  Secretary  hes  undertaken \nvoluntarily  to  cooperate  fully  in  the  achieveuent  of  the  objectives \nof  the  Court's  decree  of  July  1,  1969.  Never  once,  however,  have \nthe  pleintifis  or  any  of  the  persons  who  have  filed  briefs  amici \nin  this  action  come  forward  with  a  constructive  proposal  for  the\n27 \nidentification  of  suitable  sites  for  low-rent  public  housing  or \nfor  the  employment  of  HUD's  programs  so  as  to  speed  the  expansion \nof  housing  opportunities  available  to  these  plaintiffs.  Defendant \non  the  other  hand,  has  been  engaged  in  continuous  efforts  to  achieve \nprecisely  what  plaintiffs  demand  (Exhibit  a)! \nThere  is  not  the  slightest  evidence  that  the  defendant  is  any  less \ndetermined  than  the  plaintiffs,  or  those  who  have  filed  briefs  amici, \nto  do  what  can  be  done  to  remedy  the  effects  of  past  discrimination \nin  the  low-rent  housing  program  in  Chicago.  There  is  even  less  reason \nto  believe  that  this  can  be  better  accomplished  by  judicial  decree \nthan  by  the  voluntary  efforts  of  this  defendant  in  action  toward \nlocal  officials. \n  \nHUD  policy  already  encourages  the  utilization  of  all  of  HUD's  programs \nfor  the  purpose  of  housing  low-income  eligibles  and  providing  suiteble \nneighborhood  facilities.  A  mandatory  decree  will  do  nothing  to \nimplement  or  strengthen  that  policy. \n  \n1/  Exhibit  H  is  a  compilation  of  many  H.U.D,  regulations  and  require- \nments  epplicable  to  its  multitude  of  Programs,  each  of  which  makes \ncareful  provision  for  protection  of  equal  opportunity  and  enforce- \nment  of  the  requirements  of  the  Civil  Rights  lawa.\n28. \nA  judicial  decree  will  not  produce  sponsors  for  221(d) (3)  projects, \ner  231,  235  or  236  projects.  The  fact  is  that  the  necessity  to \noperate  under  judicial  decree  is  likely  to  discourage  such  sponsors. \nFinally,  we  cannot  wish  away  limitations  upon  authorizations  and \napproprietions.  A  judicial  decree  will  scareely  compel  the  provision \nof  edditional  authority  and  funds  by  the  Congress.\n  \n29 \nConclusion \nPlaintiffs  brash  aside  the  offer  of  cooperation  in  the  Menorandua \nfor  the  United  States  filed  in  their  suit  against  the  Housing \nAuthority,  and  asi  the  Court  to  \"/G/7  contrast  the  *  *  #  positive \nattituds  of  the  National  Comission  on  Urban  Problems.\" \n(Claimants!

There  is  tha  risk  of  a  uniformity  and  standardisa- \ntion  that  might  result  from  a  sincle  Federal  asency  contrasting \nfor  housing  in anny  perts  of  the  country.  The  sise  of  the \nburgeucratic  structure  thet  could  develop  might  stifle  new\n30 \ndevelopments,  new  techniques  and  locel  varletions.

CTOO MMAIMITCTUESE , CCURIAHE  IBRBIACZRF  AAFSISLGOECD IOABTYI  ONTH E ...' \nโ \nOe cg  ee Oe  oe eR \nHUD's  latest  brief,  purportedly  in  response  to  the  amicus \nbrief  of  the  Urban  Affairs  Committee  of  the  Chicago  Bar  Associa- \n   tion,  makes  three  points.  These  will  be  dealt  with  in  the  order \nin  which  they  appear. \ni?  fhe Federal Jurisdictional  Amount is Present  (pages 2-4). \nHUD  says  that  the  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  over  Count  I \nbecause  no  plaintiff,  singly,  has  an  interest  approaching  910,000, \n\"their  rentals  being  well  below  this  sum.\"  (p.3.) \nThe  relief  sought  is  to  require  that  HUD's  programs  in  the \nChicago  area  be  administered  in  such  a  way  as  to  assist  in  righting \nthe  wrong  which  HUD  and  CHA  have  done  to  the  plaintiffs.  Such \nan  order  would  have  nothing  to  do  with  plaintiffsโ  rent.  It  would \nhave  to  do  with  programs  the  administration  of  which  obviously \ninvolves  far  in  excess  of  $10,000.  The  desirable  rule  is  that\n    \nโthe  test  for  determining  the  amount  in  controversy  is  the \npecuniary  result  to  either  party  which  the  judgment  would \n  \ndirectly  produce.โ  Ronzio  v.  Denver  &  R.G.W.R.R.,  116  F.2d  604, \n  \n606  (10th  Cir.  1940,  emphasis  supplied.)  See,  for  example, \nDavis  v.  American  Foundry  Equipment  Co.,  94  F.2d  441,  443  (7th \n     \nCix.  L938  โ  \"{T]he  value  of  the  right  in  dispute  determines  the \njurisdiction.\");  Ridder Bros.  v.  Blethen,  142  F.2d  395,  399  (Sth \nCir.  1944  -  \"The  value  of  the  โthing  sought  to  be  accomplished \nby  the  actionโ  may  relate  to  either  or  any  party  to  the  action.\"); \nand  Government  Employees Insurance  Company  v.  Lally,  327  F.2d \n     \n568,  569  (4th  Cir.  1964  -  โ[T]he  amount  in  controversy  is  the \npecuniary  result  to  either  party  which  that  judgment  would \nproduce.\")  See  also  Hatridge  v.  Aetna Casualty  & Surety  Company, \n415  F.2d  809,  815  (8th  Cir.  1969) .* \nII.  Jurisdiction  Lies  Under  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act \nof 1964 (page 9). \nEOD 8 OR OR  a cee a  rem t ae  ee re  re  ee te  soe \nHUDโs  second  argument  is  that  the  Court  lacks  jurisdic- \ntion  over  Count  II  because  plaintiffs  are  not  entitled  to  sue \n  \n*Apart  from  its  irrelevance  HUD's  assertion  that  the  rental  interest \nof  each  plaintiff  is  less  than  $10,000  is  not  supported  by  the \nrecord  in  this  case.  It  does  appear  from  an  affidavit  of  Harry \n   J.  Schneider,  CHA's  Director  of  Management,  filed  in  the  companion \ncase  in  October,  1966,  that  plaintiff  Robert  M.  Fairfax  has  been \na  tenant  in  CHA  housing  since  1945.  Even  if  Mr.  FPairfax's  rent \nsince  that  tine  averaged  only  $50  per  month,  the  total  rent \ninvolved  to  date  would  be  $15,000,  let  alone  rent  tc  come  due  over \nthe  period  of  time  in  the  future  during  which  effective  relief \nwould  be  fashioned. \nHUD  also  makes  the  argument  (pp.  4-8)  that  CHA  is  not  HUD's \nagent.  The  relevance  of  this  argument  is  not  apparent. \n-2โ \n  \n \n  \nHUD  under  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.  This \nissue  has  been  discussed  at  length  in  the  preceding  briefs \nand  nothing  new  is  added  by  HUD's  latest  treatment. \nTit.  HUD  is  Legally  Responsible  as  a  Joint  Participant  in  CHA's \nDiscrimination  (pages  10-13). \nWith  one  extraordinary  exception  HUD's  reargument \nadds  nothing  of  substance  to  its  previous  discussion  of  the \nissue  of  its  legal  responsibility.  The  exception  is  the \nargument  that  nothing  that  happened  before  1964  is  relevant  to \na  determination  of  HUD's  legal  responsibility.  HUD  says  that \nprior  to  that  year  โthe  significance  of  site  location  in \nhousing  was  lost  upon  the  courts  and  Congress  no  less  than \n  upon  the  Secretary  and  the  predecessor  agencies  of  HUD.\"  (p.10.) \nTherefore,  the  implicit  argument  runs,  HUD's  prior  joint  parti~ \ncipation  in  CHA's  discriminatory  practices  should  be  ignored! \nThe  mere  statement  of  the  argument  suffices  for \nrebuttal.  One  might  as  well  argue  that  in  dealing  with  the \nproblem  of  remedying  segregated  school  systems,  facts  and \nactions  dating  prior  to  the  Brown  decision  in  1954  should  be \nignored. \nIn  addition,  HUD  implies  that  since  1964  it  has  not \nbeen  a  joint  participant  in  CHA's  discriminatory  practices.  UD \nforgets  that  it  approved  the  sites  for  CHA's  1965  and  1966 \nprograms  and  that  these  approvals,  permitting  a  massive  extension \nof  the  segregationist  pattern  of  public  housing  in  Chicago,  were \nsan \n  \nthe  very  actions  which  precipitated  the  filing  of  the  complaint \nin  this  case. \n(HUD  also  persists  in  its  refusal  to  recognize  that \nit  is  ite  affirmative  puxticizetion,  by  these  approvals  and \nother  actions,  as  well  as  its  financial  assistance,  that  legally \nimplicates  HUD  in  CHA's  discrimination  (p.4);  and  it  continues  to \nspeak  as  if  we  sought  to  halt  HUD's  annual  contributions  to  CHA's \nexisting  projects.  (pp.  ll-12.)  These  matters  are  discussed \nin  our  Reply  Brief  at  pages  12-18  and  28-29,  respectively.) \nFinally,  HUD  has  also  filed  another  affidavit  expanding \non  its  original  Exhibit  G.  HUD  said  in  its  Answering  Brief  that \nExhibit  G  โdemonstrates  clearly  the  defendant's  comaitment  to \nvoluntary  action  in  support  of  the  objectives  of  the  Court  decree \nagainst  C.H.A.\"  (p.  29-B.)  Our  comments  on  HUDโs  voluntary  action \n  \nappear  at  pages  18-28  of  our  Reply  Brief,  and  the  Court  is \nrespectfully  referred  to  them.  For  the  reasons  given  there  we \ncontinue  to  believe  that  it  would  be  wholly  inappropriate  for  a \ncourt  of  equity  to  relegate  plaintiffs  to  HUD's  good  intentions \nand  voluntary  efforts.* \n*fhe  affidavit  affords  no  basis  for  judging  HUD's  intentions. \n  \nSince  it  does  not  disclose  the  totality  of  HUD's  activities  in \nthe  Chicago  area  one  cannot  determine  from  it  the  net  effect  of \nHUD's  activities  in  relation  either  to  the  decree  in  the  companion \ncase  or  to  the  affirmative  contribution  8UD  might  make  to  the \nachievement  of  the  broad  objectives  of  that  decree.  For  example, \nalthough  the  affidavit  says  HUD  gave  CHA  a  reservation  for  3,000 \nunits,  it  does  not  disclose  that  CHA's  request  was  for  10,000  units. \nThe  affidavit's  listing  of  specific  actions  taken  by  HUD  (some  of \nwhich  may  be  relevant  and  others  of  which  are  clearly  irrelevant \nto  the  issues  in  this  case)  conveys  no  sense  of  whether  the  total \neffect  of  HUD's  activities  in  the  Chicago  Metropolitan  area  is \nhelpful  or  hurtful  to  the  plaintiffs. \nwยง-\n  \nRespectfully  submitted, \nAlexander  Polikoff \nCharles  R.

The  HUD \nanswering  brief  (both  the  first  7  pages  dealing  with  the \nmotion  to  dismiss  and  the  final  31  pages  dealing with  the \nmotion  for  summary  judgment)  is  referred  to  as  \"HUD's  brief. \" \nOur  brief  in  support  of  plaintiffs'  motion  for  summary \njudgment,  filed  on  October  31 ,  1969,  is  referred  to  as  \"our \nbrief\"  or  !!our  first  brief. \" \nI .  HUD'S  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  THE  ACTION  SHOULD  BE  DENIED. \nBUD's  motion  to  dismiss  the  action  rested  on  five \n\ngrounds,  each  of  which  was  discussed  in  our  first  brief .  As \nit relates  to  the  motion  to  dismiss ,  HUD 's  brief  deals  with \nonly  two  of  these  - (1)  standing,  and  (2)  CHA  as  an  allegedly \nindispensable  party  whose  presence  would  destroy  venue .  It \ndoes  not  discuss  the  other  three  grounds  - (3)  exhaustion  of \nadministrative  remedies,  (4)  jurisdiction and  (5)  the  alleged \nfailure  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief may  be  gr anted. \n(Our  br.  18- 30.)  These  last  three  issues  are  therefore  not \ndiscussed  further  in  this brief. \nA.  Plaintiffs  Have  Standing  to  Sue. \n(1)  Plaintiffs  Have  Standing  Under  the  Fifth  Amendment. \nIn  our  first  brief we  said  it was  beyond  dispute \nthat  an  aggrieved  citizen may  sue  a  federal  official  for \nviolation  of  his  federal  constitutional  rights .  We  said \nthat  principle was  so  clear  that even  HUD  did  not  contest \nit,  and  we  cited  three  cases  illustrating  the  principle  in \noperation . \nIn  Bolling  v .  Sharpe ;  347  U.S.  49/  (1954 ),  aggrieved \ncitizens  successfully  sued  federal  officials  who  were \nviolating  their  Fifth Amendment  rights  by  operating  a \nracially  segregated  school  system.  HUD  is  silent about  that \ncase .  In  Kent  v .  Dulles,  357  u.s.  116  (1958),  aggrieved \nciti zens  successfully  sued  a  federal  official  who  was \n-2-\n\nviolating  their  Fifth Amendment  rights  by  refusing  to  issue \npassports  to  them.  HOD  is  silent about  t hat  case  too. \nFlast v~  Cohen~  392  U.S~  83  (1968) ,  held  that  aggrieved  ci tizens \nยท as  federal  taxpayers ยทยท  (392  U.S .  at  38)  had  standing  to  sue \nfederal  officials  for  violating  their First Amendment  rights \nby  using  federal  funds  to  finance  instruction  in  religious \nschools .  The  plaintiff citizens  \"were  resting  their  standing \nto maintain  the  action  solely on  t heir status  as  f ederal \ntaxpayers.\"  (392  U.S.  at  85 . )  HOD  has  chosen  to  comment \non  only  this  case  of  the  three. \nWe  cited Flast  in our  brief  because  HOD 's  basic \nargument  against  plaintiffs'  standing  rested  on  taxpayer \ncases  such  as  Frothingham  v .  Mellon;  262  U.S.  447  (1923) , \nfrom  which  HOD's  first  brief quoted  the  Court 1s  observati on \nthat, \n\"(Where  an  interest)  is  shared  with \nmillions  of  others,  (it)  is  compara \ntively minute  and  indeterminable  . . . '; \n(HOD's  first  brief  [filed  Dec .  1966] , \np. 8 0) \nFrothingham had  stood  for  45  years  as  an  impenetrable  barrier \nto  suits brought  by  plaintiffs  who  could  assert only  the \ninterest of  federal  taxpayers .  Flast,  decided  after  HOD's \nfirst  briefs were  filed,  held  that  even  when  a  plaintiff's \nstanding  rested  solely  on  his  status  as  a  federal  taxpayer , \n-3-\n\nstanding  would  be  upheld  notwithstanding  Frothingham  where \nthe  plaintiff  t.axpayer  had  'ยทsuch  a  personal  stake  in  t he \noutcome  of  the  controversy  as  to  assure  that  concrete \nadverseness  which  sharpens  the  presentation  of  issues  upon \nwhich  the  court  so  largely  depends  for  illumination  of \ndifficult constitutional  questions . \"  (392  U.S.  at  99 . )  We \nthink  that  even  if plaintiffs  were  bringing  this  case  as \ntaxpayers  they  would  meet  the  test of  Flast  and  t hat HUD 1 ~ \nreliance  on  the  Frothingham  line  of  cases  would  not  avail \nit .  Therefore  we  cited  Flast .* \nBut  of  course  'plaintiffs  here  have  not  brought \nthis  case  as  taxpayers\"  (HUD  br .  3- 4),  t hey  have  brought \nt his  case  \"as  present  and  future  users  of  the  [public  housin~ ] \nsystem, \"  Gautreaux  v.  CHA,  265  F.Supp .  582,  583,  as  the \n~olling plaintiffs  brought  their  case  as  users  of  a  school \nsystem ,  and  as  the  Kent  plaintiffs  brought  their case  as \n*Flast  found  the  required  \"personal  stake\"  where  the  federal \naction  complained  of  was  a  violation  of  a  specific  constitu \ntional  (First Amendment)  prohibition,  as  distinguished  from \ncases  like  Frothingham where  standing  was  based  merely  on \nclaims  that  the  federal  action was  increasing  the  amount  of \ntaxpayers'  taxes  or exceeded  the  general  powers  of  Congress . \nThe  Fifth Amendment  prohibition  against  racial  discrimination \nwhich  is  at  issue  here  is  in  this  respect  like  the  Fi rst \nAmendment  prohibition  against  the  establishment  of  religion . \nSee  Arrington  v.  City  of  Fairfield,  Alabama 414  F. 2d  687 , \n1 \n691-92  (5th  Cir.  1969},  for  a  discussion  and  application  of \nthe  Flast  test  in  a  racial  discrimination  context. \n- 4-\n\napplicants  for  passports .  It  is  ostrich~like on  t he  part \nof  HUD  to  ignore  Bolling  and  Kent while  fretting  about whet her, \nunder  Flast,  plaintiffs would  have  had  standing  to  bring \nt his  case  as  taxpayers  had  they  sought  to  do  so .* \nWe  have  also  emphasized ,  t hough  HUD  has  ignored  the \npoint,  that  st anding  exists  in  t his  case  on  two  grounds  -\nt he  Fifth Amendment  and  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964. \n*HUD  ci tes  South  Suburban  Safeway  Lines ,  Inc .  v .  Cit y  of \nChicago,  416  F. 2d  535  (7th  Cir.  1969),  whi ch  distinguished \nFl ast  and  held  that  the  pl aintiffs  t here  l acked  standi ng  as \na  taxpayer .  The  Court  in Safeway  did  not  say why  i t  found \nFl ast  i napplicable  to  the  plaintiff is  claim  of  viol ation  of \nconstitutional  rights  (see  416  F.2d  at  536- 37) .  Presumabl y \ni t  was  because  t he  constitutional  claim was  patentl y \nfrivolous ,  being  based  on  an  asserted  but  nonexi stent \nstatutory  right  to  the  protection  of  a  compet itive  i nt erest \nal leged  to  have  been  unconsti tutionally  invaded  by  reason \nof  the  fact  that compensation was  not  paid  f or  t he  invasion . \n(The  plaintiff bus  company  challenged  a  grant of  federal \nfunds  to  establish  a  competitive  service . ) \n\"In  the  absence  of  a  broad  statutory provi sion  for \nreview,  economic  injury  alone  is  general ly  assumed \nto be  insufficient  to  give  standing  for  a  chall enge \nof  administrative  action . \"  Cahn  and  Cahn,  The  New \nSovereign  Immunity,  81  Harv.  L.  Rev .  929,  935  (1968) \n[hereinafter  cited as  New  Sover eign  Immunity] . \nSee  also,  Norwalk  CORE  v.  Norwalk  Redevelopment  Agency,  395 \nF.2d  920 ,  927  {2nd  Cir.  1968).  The  taxpayer  t hus  l acked  t he \nโขโขl egally protected  interest\"  required  by  Flast .  Cf. , \nJenkins  v .  McKeithen,  395  U.S .  411 ,  424  (1969) .  In  any  event, \nSafeway  is  so  utterly unlike  Flast ,  Arrington  or  thi s  case \non  its  facts  that it could  not  furnish  guidance  on  the \nabil i ty  of  plaintiffs  to  bring  t his  case  as  t axpayers  even \ni f  that were  a  relevant  question . \n-ยท5-\n\nThe  several  cases  cited  in  our  first  brief  to  show  that \nthere  is  standing  under  the  Civil  Rights  Act  also  support \nstanding  under  the  Constitution;  if  there  is  standing  to \nsue  HUD  for  violating  a  statute,  there  is  standing  also \nto  sue  it for  violating  t he  Constitution .  Thus,  if HUD \nwere  right  about  standing,  Norwalk,  Powelton,  Western \nAddition  and  Hick~,  all  cases  successfully  brought  against \nHUD ,  must  have  been  wrongly  decided .* \nFinally,  of course,  HUD  also  ignores  Gautreaux  v. \nCHA.  If  plaintiffs  have  the  \"personal  stake\"  to  sue  CHA  for \na  violation  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment ,  they  self-evidently \ndo  not  lose  that  personal  stake  when  they  sue  HUD  for  a \nviolation of  the  Fifth Amendment. \n(2)  Plaintiffs  Have  Standing  under  the  Civil  Rights  Act. \nIt is ostrich- like  too  for  HUD  to  ignore  our \ndiscussion  of  the  cases  cited  in  our  brief which  have  under-\nmined  Green  Street Association  v.  Daley,  373  F.2d  1  (7th  Cir. \n1967),  and  support  plaintiffs'  standing  to  sue  under  Section \n601  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  (42  U.S.C.  ยง2000d).  Since  HUD \ndoes  little more  than  cite  Green  Street again,  we  will  not \nrepeat our  discussion  of  that  case  but merely  refer  the  Court \n*See  our  br.  10-12,  and  the  next  subsection  of  this  brief.  See \nparticularly  the  discussion  of  the  obligati on  of  the  courts \nto  hear  claims  of  violations  of  constitutional  rights  in \nNorwalk,  395  F.2d  at 926-32. \n-6-\n\nto  pages  6-17  of our  first  brief.  It should  be  noted v  however, \nthat  subsequent  to  the  filing  of  our  brief  (and  relying  on \nthe  Abbott  Laboratories  case  there  cited)  two  decisions  of \nthe  Supreme  Court  have  contributed  to  \"the  trend  . โข .  toward \nenlargement  of  the  class  of  people  who  may  protest  administra-\ntive  actiona  where  statutory  rights  are  asserted .  Association \nof  Data  Processing  Organizations  v.  Camp ,  38  Law  Week  4193, \n4194  (March  3,  1970) .  See  also,  Barlow  v .  Collins,  38  Law \nWeek  4195  (March  3,  1970). \nIt should  also  be  noted  that  (again  subsequent  to \nthe  filing  of  our  brief)  the  Supreme  Court  ruled  that even \nwhere  Congress  has  stated  that  there  is  to  be  no  right  of \njudicial  review  under  a  statute,  such  review  will be  allowed \nwhere  the  administrative  agency  has  clearly proceeded  unlaw-, \nu.s. \nfully .  Bree~ v .  Selective  Service  Board,  ,  90 \nS .Ct.  661  (1970).  Ironically,  Breen  is  the  very  case  cited  in \nour  first  brief as  involving  a  statute  containing  \"clear  and \nconvincing  evidence\"  that Congress  intended  no  review.  (Our \n* \nbr.  8 \") \n*Safeway  denied  standing  under  the  statute  there  involved \nbecause  of  the  Court's  conclusion  that  Congress  did  not \nintend  \"resort  to  judicial review\"  to  be  had  under  that \nstatute .  416  F. 2d  at 539.  That  conclusion  as  to  that \nstatute  plainly  does  not  require  a  like  conclusion  as  to \nSection  601  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act.  However,  the  thrust \nof  Breen  appears  to  be  that even  i f  the  Court \\'Jere  to  conclude \n(Continued  on  next  page) \n-7-\n\nB.  CHA  is  not  Indispensable  but  Should  be  Joined  as  a \nCourtesy ,  and  May  be  Joined  \\-Ti thout  Destroying  Venue. \nHUD  says  CHA  is  an  indispensable  party  (HUD  br.  5),  but \ncannot  be  joined without  destroying  venue  (HUD  br.  6).  The \nresult  is  said  to  be  that  '1there  is  no  court\"  in  which  this \naction  can  be  brought.  (Ibid. )  In  reaching  this  harsh \nconclusion  HUD  utterly  ignores  the  arguments  made  on  the \nsubject  in  our  brief.  (Our  br.  30-31.) \nCHA  is not  indispensable  because v  contrary  to  what  HUD \nsays  (HUD  br.  5),  we  do  not  seek  an  injunction which  would \naffect  any  rights  of  CHA.  See  the  closely  analogous  situation \nin  Powelton  Civic  Home  Owners  Association  v.  Department  of \nHousing  and  Urban  Development,  284  F.Supp.  809,  814  (E.D.  Pa . \n1968) ,  from  which  a  quotation  appears  at page  31  of  our  brief. \nBut  the  indispensable  party  issue  is  academic  since  we \nhave  moved  to  join CHA,  and  the  remaining  question  is whether \nvenue  would  be  destroyed  by  the  granting of  that motion. \nHUD  asserts  that  the  statute  upon  which  venue  in  this  action \n(Continued  from  previous  page ) \nthat Congress  did  not  intend  judicial  review  of  violations  of \nSection  601  by  federal  officials,  such  review  would  be  allowed \nin  cases  where  rights  granted  under  Section  601  had  clearly \nbeen  violated.  That,  of  course,  is  this  case,  whereas  in \nSafeway  the  asserted  violation  of  statutory  rights  appeared  tore \nas  frivolous  as  the  alleged  violation of  Constitutional  rights . \nIt should  be  recalled  that Hicks  v .  Weaver  explicitly held \nHUD  liable  for  its violation  of Section  601 ,  presumably  (since \nthe  decision  preceded  Breen)  because  it believed  that Congress \ndid  not  intend  to  preclude  judicial  review  of  such  violations. \n-8-\n\nis  based,  28  U.S.C.  ยง139l(e),  requires  that each  defendant \nbe  an  officer,  employee  or  agency  of  the  United  States  and \nthat  therefore  venue  under  this  section woul d  be  destroyed \nif CHA  were  joined.  (HUD  br.  6. ) \nA  1967  Pennsylvania  District Court  case,  Chase  Savi ngs \nand  Loan  Assvn .  v.  Federal  Horne  Loan  Bank  Board,  269  F.Supp . \n965  (E .D.  Pa .  1967),  is  the  only  authority  cited  t o  support \nHUD ' s  construction  of  the  venue  statute .  But  two  l ater \nDistrict Court  decisions  and  a  later Court  of  Appeals  decision \neach  rejected  the  \"absurd  result which  derives  from  such  a \nconstruction\"  of  the  venue  statute .  Brotherhood  of  Locomotive \nEng .  v .  Denver  & R.  G.  W.  Co. ,  290  F.Supp .  612,  615  (D .  Colo. \n1968) .  The  two  District Court  decisions,  Brotherhood  and \nPowelton,  were  cited  in  our  first brief .  Each,  af ter \nconsidered  discussion,  concludes  t hat ยง139l(e)  sustains  venue \nin  cases  like  this  one .  (Our  br .  31 ;  neither  case  is \nmentioned  in HUD ' s  brief. )  The  Court of Appeals  for  the \nSecond  Circuit has  now  reached  the  same  conclusion .  Kletschka \nv .  Driver,  411  F.2d  436,  442  (2nd  Cir .  1969) . \nMoreover ,  since  the  filing  of  our  first brief we  have \nlearned  that Judge  Hoffman  of  this  District had  earlier  reached \nthe  same  result.  Inmates  of  the  Cook  County  Jail  v .  Tierney, \nNo.  68  C  504  (1968),  concerned  the  custody  of  federal  and \n-9-\n\nnon-federal  prisoners  in  the  Cook  County  Jail  and  both \nfederal  officials  (resident  in  the  District of  and \nColur~ia) \nstate officials were  named  as  defendants.  The  federal \ndefendants  argued,  exactly  as  HUD  argues  here,  that ยง139l(e) \nwas  inapplicable  to  such  a  situation and  that  the  action \nshould  therefore  be  dismissed,  relying  on  Chase  Savings .  In \nrejecting  the  argument  Judge  Hoffman \nsaid ~ \n\"Having  examined  the  legislative  history \n[of  ยง139l(e)] ,  the  Court  concludes  that \nthe  interpretation  called  for  by  the \ndefendants  would  thwart  the  Congressional \npolicy  revealed  in  t hat  history .  The \nintention  of Congress  was  to  facilitate \naccess  to  the  Courts  by  plaintiffs with  a \ncause  of  action  against  federal  officials \" \nSuch  access  would  be  hindered  rather  than \nfacilitated  where  a  plaintiff  is  compelled \nby  the  facts  of  his  case  to  sue  not  only \nthe  federal  official or  officials  but  also \nother  defendants  residing  in  another \ndistrict such  as  the  district in which  he \nor  t hey  reside .\"  (Transcript  of  Proceedings \non  August  22,  1968,  pp.  23-24.)* \n*In  declining  to  follow  Chase  Savings  Judge  Hoffman \nsaid ~ \n\"The  only  case  in which  this  question  has  been \nraised  and  which  adopted  the  argument  made  by \nthese  defendants  did  not  examine  the  legislative \nhistory behind  the  subsection  but  relied  solely on \nits  literal  language ,  specifically  'each  defendant.

PLAINTIFFS'  MOTION  FOR  SUiv1MARY  JUDGfvlENT  SHOULD  BE  GRANTED . \nA.  There  is  no  Genuine  Issue  of  Material  Fact. \nHUD  asserts  over  and  over  again  that  there  are  issues  of \nfact.  For  example,  \"there  is  a  clear  showing  of  genuine \nissues  of  material  facts  unresolved''  (HUD  br.  8);  \"Subst antial \nissues  of  fact  precluding  summary  judgment exist in  this \nmatter\"  (Id.  9) 1  there  is  a  need  to  \"sift\"  facts  and  to  get \nthe  ''specific\"  facts  and  not  to  \"foreclose  the  factual \nissues  . ..  by  attributing  the  intentions  and  actions  of CHA \nt o  the  Secretary\"  (Id.  4);  etc. \nIt should  be  plain  that  in  t his  action  we  have  relied \nexclusively  upon  HUD's  own  briefs,  affidavits  and  exhibits \nfor  the  facts  as  to  the  Secretary's  actions  and  intentions. \nWe  do  not  dispute  HUD1s  assertionr and  have  offered no  evidence \nof  our  own  in  t he  form  of  affidavits  or  otherwise  as  to  either \nmatter.  tve  have  directed  the  Court  exclusively  to  the \ndocuments  submitted  by  HUD  itself  for  the  facts  as  to  HUD's \nactions  and  intentions . \n-11-\n\nThe  HUD  briefs,  affidavits  and  exhibits  show  that  three \nfacts  with  respect  to  HUD's  actions  and  intentions  are \nundisputed : \n1.  HUD  participated  in  and  approved  almost \nevery  action  taken  by  CHA  in  the  carrying  on  of \nthe  low-rent  public  housing  program  in Chicago, \nspecifically  including  site  selection.  (See \nour  brief  24-28 . ) \n2.  HUD  supplied CHA  with  substantially  all \nof  the  funds  necessary  for  the  carrying on  of \nthat program,  which  is  entirely  dependent  upon \nsuch  financing.  (Our  br.  25.) \n3.  HUD  was  aware  of  the  fact  that  the  low \nrent housing  program was  being  carried  on  in  a \ndiscriminatory way  and  made  numerous  and  consis \ntent efforts,  commencing  in  1950,  to  change  the \ndiscriminatory  site selection  pattern.  (HUD \nExhibit A,  3 . ) \n~~ \nThese  three  facts  (the  last of  which  is  discussed  in  more \ndetail  below}  are  clearly not  in dispute .  HUD's  constantly \nreiterated  assertion  that  genuine  issues  of material  fact \nexist  in  this  case  is  disingenuous  rhetoric . \nB.  HUD 1s  Liability  is Clear  as  a  Matter  of  Law,  and  is \nnot Based  upon  \"Vaque\"  or  \"Hazy\"  Concepts . \nHUD  accuses  us  of  talking  ~'vaguely11  of HUD's  financial \nand  administrative  involvement  in CHA's  discriminatory  conduct \n(HUD  br.  3)  and  refers  to  our  \"hazy  concept  of  involvement. '1 \n(Ibid.)  And  in  discussing  the  cases  upon  which  we  rely  to \ndemonstrate  its  legal  liability,  HUD  twice  distorts our \n-12-\n\nposition  by  implying  that HUD  liability is  sought  t o  be  based \nupon  financial  assistance  or  involvement  \"standing  alone . \" \n( HUD  br .  5 ,  6 . ) \nThere  is  nothing  \"vague\"  or  \"hazy\"  about  HUD's \ninvolvement with  CHA.  The  facts  already  referred  to  in \nthe  preceding  sub-section  of  this  brief  appear  in  depth  in \ndocuments  filed  by  HUD  and  in  statements  made  in  its brief . \nHUD 's  financial  involvement  is  succinctly  stated by  HUD  as \nfollows : \n\"In  practical  operation  of  the  low-rent \nhousing  program,  the  existence  of  the \nprogram  is entirely dependent  upon \ncontinuing,  year  to year,  Federal  financial \nassistance . \"  (HUD 's  first  brief, \np . 5 ~ \nfurther  detail  appears  at page  25  of  our \nbrief . ) \nHUD's  administrative  involvement  is  equally  clear  although, \nbecause  so  extensive,  it is  not  possible  to  state  so  succinctly. \nWe  have  reviewed  some  of  that  involvement  at pages  25-28  of \nour  first brief,  to which  pages  the  Court  is  respectfully \nreferred.  As  those  pages  show,  HUD  approves  just about  every-\nthing  CHA  does.  Thus,  HUD's  involvement with  CHA  is  not \n\"financial assistance  standing  alone\" ,  and  is  neither  vague \nnor  hazy .  It is extensive ,  pervasive  and  quite  specific . \nIt is  administrative  and  operational  as  well  as  financial . \nAnd  it admittedly  continued  over  a  period  of  decades  with  full \n- -13-. \n\nknowledge  of  the  unwillingness  or  inabi l i ty  of  CHA  \"t o  locate \nl ow  rent  housing  projects  in white  neighborhoods \"  (HUD' s \nExhi bit A,  ' 3)  - with  full  knowledge ,  that  is ,  of  what  HUD's \nbr i ef'  calls  \"the  City's  intention  to  resi st  desegregation . โขยท \n(HUD's  br.  13-A. ) \nHUD' s  l egal  liability  flows  directly  out  of  that \ninvolvement  andยท knowledge .  In  Bur ton  v .  Wilmington  Parking \nAuthority,  365  u.s .  715  (1961),  the  Author i t y  leased  a  portion \nof  i ts  premises  to  a  restaurant  operator  (Eagle)  who  declined \nto  serve  Negroes .  The  Authority  could  have  affirmatively \nrequired  in  i t s  lease  t o  Eagl e  that  there  be  no  di scrimination \nagainst Negr o  customers  but  i t  did  not  do  so.  The  Supreme \nCourt  said : \nโข; [N] o  St ate  may  effective l y  abdicate  its \nresponsibilities  by  either  ignoring  them \nor  by  merely  fail ing  to  dischar ge  them \nwhatever  the  motive  may  be .  It is of  no \nconsolation  to  an  individual  denied  the \nequal  protection  of  the  laws  t hat  it was \ndone  in  good  faith . .. .  By  its  i nacti on , \nthe  Authority ,  and  t hrough  it the  State, \nhas  .. .  made  itself a  party  to  [Eagle's] \nrefusal  of  service  . . .  The  State  has  so \nfar  i nsinuated  itself i nto  a  position  of \ninterdependence  with  Eagle  that  it must \nbe  recognized  as  a  joint par ticipant  in \nthe  challenged  act ivity  . . . \"  365  U.S .  at \n725 . \nHUD  suggests  that Burton  is  not  a  controll ing  authority \nhere  because  \"no  such  relationship  of  interdependence  between \n-ยท14-\n\nthe  Secretary  and  the  CHA  has  been  established.\"  (HUD  br.  4. ) \nBut  it is  perfectly  obvious  that  the  relationship  of  inter-ยท \ndependence  between  the  Parking  Authority  and  Eagle  was  trifling \ncompared  with  that between  the  Secretary  and  CHA.  The \nParking Authority  had  11not  located  the  business  of Eagle \nwithin  the  [parking]  facility  for  the  convenience  and  service \nof  the  public  using  the  parking  service. \"  Wilmington  Parking \nAuthority  v .  Burton,  157  A\"2d  894,  902  (Del.  1960).  The \nAuthority  had  11not  financially  enabled  the  business  of Eagle \nto  operate .\"  (Ibid.)  11The  only  concern  the  Authority  ha[d] \nwith  Eagle  [was]  the  receipt  of  rent  . .. \"  (Ibid. )  The \nAuthority  \"disclaim[ed]  any  control  over  the  policies  of  its \ntenant  .. . 11  and  had  \"not  purported  to  dictate  to  the \nrestaurant  as  to  how  its  business  should  be  run. \"  Burton  v. \nWilmington  Parking Authority,  150  A.2d  197 ,  198  {Ct.  of \nChancery,  Del. ,  1959).  In  short,  t he  \"interdependence\"  in \nBurton  was  a  typical  lessor-lessee  relationship with  the \nlessor  having  no  right  to  control  the  lessee's  business \noperation  or  other  special  authority,  right or  position.  By \ncontrast,  CHA  is  not  only  \"entirely dependent\"  upon  HUD \nfinancially  but must  obtain  HUD 1s  specific  approval  with \nrespect  to  almost  every  detail  of  its ongoing  operation. \nHUD  quotes  from  thig Court's  first  opinion  in  the  CHA \n-15-\n\ncase  the  requirement  of  showing  affirmative  discriminatory \naction,  presumably  to  imply  that  there  is  no  such  showing  with \nrespect  to  HUD.  (HUD  br.  7. )  But  such  action  is  shown  as  a \nmatter  of  law  by  HUD's  relationship  t o  CHA,  just as  in  Burton, \nwhere  there  was  no  showing  of  discriminatory  action  by  the \nParking Authority  apart  from  its  relationship  to  its \nrestaurant  lessee,  the  Court  concluded  that,  given  the \nrelationship,  the  Authority  had  made  itsel f  a  party  to  the \ndiscrimination  \"by  its  inaction . \"  365  U.S .  at  725 . \nHUD  says  Burton  argues  against a  summary  judgment  here \nbecause  of  its  emphasis  upon  the  need  for  \"sifti ng  facts . u \n(HUD  br.  4. )  In  fact,  Burton  decided  on  a  motion  for \n~ \nsummary  judgment  (365  U.S.  715 ,  722),  and  what  the  Supreme \nCourt  said was  that  facts  must  be  sifted  to  attribute  true \nsignificance  to  the  nonobvious  involvement  of  the  State  in \nprivate  conduct.  (Ibid.)  Here ,  t he  involvement  of  HUD  in \nCHA's  conduct  is hardly  nonobvious ,  and  in  any  event  the \nundisputed  facts  as  to  the  relationship  are  before  the \nHUDยท-CH1~-\nCourt  in  voluminous  detail .  Surely  this  case  is  a  fortiori \nwhen  laid  alongside  Burton. \nBurton  relied  upon  Cooper  v \"  Aaron,  358  U.S.  1  (1958), \nfor  the  statement  in  the  latter opinion  that  a  state will  be \nresponsible  for  discrimination  i f  it participates  in  the \n-16-\n\nchallenged  activity  \"through  any  arrangement,  management, \nu.s. \nfunds  or property. ,  (365  722 . )  HUD's  response  to  this \nprinciple  is  to  pretend  that we  are  dealing  here  with  a \ncase  of  \"financial  assistance  to  a  discriminating  party, \nstanding  alone\"  (HUD  br.  5 ),  a  pretense which,  even  if true, \nwould  still be  non-responsive  to  the  teaching  of  Cooper. \nFinally,  HUD  seeks  to  avoid  the  force  of  Hicks  v . \nWeaver,  302  F.Supp\"  619  (E.D.  La.  1969),  by  pointing  out  the \nself-evident  fact  that Chicago,  Illinois  is  not  Bogalusar \nLouisiana.  (HUD  br.  5 . )  But we  cited Hicks  not  because  we \nwere  confused  about  geography  but  because  the  court  there \nnoted,  \\'lhat is  equally  true  here,  that HUD  \"could  have  hal ted \nthe  discrimination  at any  step  in  the  program.\"  (Our  br.  29 . ) \nHUD's  failure  to  do  so  made  HUD  an  \"active  participant\"  in \ndiscrimination  in  the  view  of  the  Hicks  court,  a  conclusion \ncompelled by  Burton  no  less  in Chicago  than  in Bogalusa. \nBurton,  Cooper  and  Hicks  all  require  that HUD  be \nadjudged  jointly liable with  CHA  for  the  segregated Chicago \npublic  housing  system.* \n*See  also  Colon  v .

HUD 's  \"Consistent Activity  to  Preclude  Discrimination'ยท \ndoes  not Absolve  it from  Liability. \nHUD  also  tries  to  avoid  the  impact  of  Burton ,  Cooper \nand  Hicks  by  arguing  that,  because  it has  numerous  equal \nopportunity  regulations  and  has  tri ed  to  dissuade  CHA  from \nits discriminatory  policies,  it is  not  legally  responsible \nas  a  \"joint participant\"  under  the  Burton  doctrine  for \nChicago's  segregated  public  housing  system. \nAttached  to HUD's  brief  are  approximately  2  inches  of \nHUD  regulations  and  other documents  applicable  to  HUD's \nvarious  programs  (Exhibit  H)  \"each  of  which  makes  careful \nprovision  for  protection  of  equal  opportunity  and  enforcement \n* \nof  the  requirements  of  the  Civil  Rights  laws . ยทโข  ( HUD  b r .  2 7 . ) \nAn  affidavit  describes  HUD's  fair  housing  enforcement \nactivities  against  real  est ate  brokers  and  others .

First, \nduring  the  entire  period  (from  1950)  to  which  Mr .  Bergeron's \naffidavit  refers,  CHA  was  carrying  on  a  discriminatory  housing \nprogram.  Gautreaux  v.  CHA,  296  F.Supp.  907.  Second,  HUD  was , \nduring  the  entire  period,  perfectly  aware  of  this  discrimina-\ntion .  The  Bergeron  affidavit,  the  Burstein  deposition  and \nHUD's  brief  all make  this  clear,  including  par-ticularly  this \ni ronic  comparison: \n\"If mere  knowledge  of  the  City's  intention \nto  resist desegregation  implicates  HUD, \nthen  the  policeman  is  indeed  implicated  in \nthe  nefarious  activities  of  those  he \npursues.\"  (HUD  br.  13-A. )* \nFinally,  possessing  this  knowledge,  and  despite  t he  f act \nthat  its  \"continuous  activity\"  met  with  absolutely  no  success \nwhatever  in  respect  to  CHA's  family  housing  program,  HUD \ncontinued  for  decades  to  approve  CHA's  sites  and  to  fund  its \nprojects,  thereby making  it possible  for  CHA  to  produce \n*HUD  says  it \"believed\"  CHA's  sites  to  be  \"lawful  but  not \noptimal.\"  (HUD  br.  13.)  We  assume  this  to  be  the  case  and \nhave  not  charged  HUD  with  believing  that  its  course  of  conduct \nwas  illegal  any  more  than we  charged CHA  with  believing  that \nits conduct was  in  violation of  lav.1. \n-20-\n\nChicago 's  segregated  family  public  housing  system. \nSince  none  of  the  foregoing  facts  is  in dispute  (all \ncome  from  BUD's  own  exhibits  and  briefs)  the \naffidavits ~ \nCourt  is presented with  a  precisely  formulated  legal  issue : \nDo  BUD's  non-discrimination  regulations  and  efforts,  particu-\nlarly  its  \"numerous  and  consistent  efforts  . ..  to  persuade \nthe  Chicago  Housing  Authority  to  locate  low-rent  housing \nprojects  in white  neighborhoods,\"  absolve  it from  legal \nresponsibility  for  having  approved  and  funded  a  discriminatory \npublic  housing  program? \nAs  a  matter  of  legal  principle  this  Court  has  already \nanswered  a  substantially identical  question  in  the  companion \ncase.  There  CHA  (1)  urged  that  its officials  never  entertained \nracist  attitudes,  (2)  pointed  to  the  City  Council's  power  to \napprove  sites which,  as  a  matter  of  practical  politics, \ncompelled  CHA,  however  reluctantly,  to  accommodate  its \nprocedures  to  the  Council  if the  urgent  goals  of  the  low \ncost  housing  program  were  to  be  achieved,  and  (3)  emphasized \nits own  efforts  to  influence  the  Council's  actions  by  its \npersistent  selection  of white  sites  at  the  ini tial  stage. \n(See  296  F.Supp.  at  914 . )  The  Court  responded  to  these \narguments  as \nfollows ~ \n\"It is  no  defense  that  the  City  Council's \npower  to  approve  sites may  as  a  matter  of \n-21-\n\npractical  politics  have  compelled  CHA  to \nadopt  the  pre-clearance  procedure  which  was \nknown  by  CHA  to  incorporate  a  racial  vet o . \nIn  fact,  even  if CHA  had  not  participated \nin  the  elimination  of  te  sites ,  its \n~vhi \nofficials were  bound  by  the  Constitution \nnot  to  exercise  CHA' s  discretion  to  decide \nto  build  upon  sites which  were  chosen  by \nsome  other  agency  on  the  basis  of  race. \nv. \nCooper  Aaron,  358  U.S.  1,  78  S .Ct.  1401 , \n3  L.Ed.2d  5  (1958) i  Orleans  Parish  School \nBoard  v.

The  result has  been  to \ninstitutionalize  a  system  of  second  class,  high \ndensity  housing  that has  become  anathema  to \nurban  neighborhoods  throughout  the  country. \n\"You  cannot  rely on  Federal  requirements \nto  produce  this  effect  [insuring  goals  of equal \nprotection]  because  they  still present  an  array \nof  options,  alternatives,  and  generalized \nmandates  that allow  the  system  t o  achieve  its \n-26-\n\npriority  goal  - production  of  the  maximum \nnumber  of  low  priced  units  - by  overriding \nthe  need  for  equal  protection. \"  {Emphasis \nadded)* \nLike  observations  have  been  made  in  less muted  language \nby  others.  Thus ,  one  observer  of  urban  problems ,  who  has \nalso  served  as  a  consultant  to  several  government  agencies , \nincluding  HUD,  says  that  current  urban  renewal  and  housing \nprograms,  including  public  housing  programs,  \"could be  viewed \nas  a  concerted effort to  maintain  the  ghetto. \"** \n*For  a  case  study  in microcosm  - relating  to  eviction \nprocedures  - of  what may  be  expected  from  HUD's  \"voluntary \nefforts, \"  see  New  Sovereign  Immunity,  81  Harv.  L.  Rev.  964-\n65 .  It is  illuminating  to observe  that  HUD  views  as  a \nsignificant  illustration of  its  voluntary  efforts  an  offer \nto  engage  in  an  unnecessary  and  therefore  meaningless \nscreening  of  CHA  site proposals  to  advise  the  Court  as  to \ntheir  conformity  with  the  Court's  order  in  the  companion \ncase.

The  authors  also  noted  the \nconclusion  of  the  Civil  Rights  Commission  t hat  government \npolicies  for  low  cost  housing  were  \"further  reinforcing  the \ntrend  toward  racial  and  economic  separation  in  metropolitan \nareas, \"  and \nsaid~ \n\"An  alternative  approach  would  aim  at drastically \nexpanding  the  supply  of  low  i ncome  housing  outside \nthe  ghetto.

Absent  such  a  decree  we  will  be \nleft with  the  continuing  11good  intentions\"  and  \"good  offices\" \nof  federal  officials who  for  years  tried  to  reverse  the \nChicago  pattern  - and  wound  up  with  a  dismal  and  unconstitu-\ntional  all-Negro  public  housing  system. \nE.  HUD's  \"Scare\"  Arguments  in  Opposition  to  an  Order \nare  not  Supportable. \nTo  persuade  this  Court  that  no  order  should  be  entered \nagainst  it HUD  makes  a  number  of  assertions  which may  fairly \nbe.  characterized as  \"scare:r  arguments.  These  are  arguments \nwhich  appear  to be  designed,  without  authority or  supporting \nlogic,  to  frighten  the  Court  into  relieving HUD  of  the \nresponsibility which  should  be  imposed.upon  it.  They  do  not \nmerit  extended  response . \n(1)  The  Full  Faith  and  Credi t  of  the  United  States \nis  not  Involved. \nThe  first  scare  argument  is  that  the  order we  seek \nwould  produce  a  breach  of  a  solemn  obligation of  the  United \nStates  and  a  dishon6ring  of  its  full  faith  and  credit.  HUD \nasserts  that we  are  asking  the  Court  \"to  terminate  a  solemn \nobligation of  the  United  States  to  the  performance  of  which \n... \n-28-\n\nthe  full  faith  and  credit of  the  United  States  is \npledged , ~ \n(HUD  br.  15),  and  \"to  have  the  United  States  dishonor  the \npledge  of  its  full  faith  and  credit  to  the  discharge  of  its \ncontract obligations. \"  (Id .  16.)  HUD  speaks  of  \"forced \ndefault\"  in  the  financing  of  the  low-rent  housing  program, \nand  says  the  Court  cannot  acquiesce  in our  prayer  for  relief \nrepudiating  the  full  faith  and  credit of  the  United \nยท~without \nStates. \"  (Id.  li.) \nThis  argument  may  charitably be  described  as \nnonsense.  It is plain  that we  do  not  seek  the  repudiation \nof  any  commitment  of  the  United  States;  indeed  we  affirmatively \nargued  (our  br.  16-17)  that  the  termination  of  federal \nassistance  would  be  counter-productive  and  harmful  to  the \nplaintiff class.  This  posi~ion HU0 1S  brief  conveniently \nignores  except  that f  after  all  the  references  to  the \nrepudiation  of  full  faith  and  credit have  presumably  had \ntheir  intended  effect t  HUD  does  acknowledge  t hat plaintiffs \n\"appear  to  have  abandoned  their  claim  to  a  terminati on  of \nFederal  financial  assistance  for  the  program  in Chicago . :โข \n(HUD  br.  22 . )  But  even  this  grudging  concession  is  inaccurate. \nApart  from  the  fact  that  the  relief  now  sought  is  affirmative \nand  not  prohibitory,  the  complaint  in  this  case  did  not  seek \na  ntermination  of  Federal  financial  assistance  for  the  program \n-29-\n\nin  Chicago.\"  It asked  only  that  HUD  be  enjoined  from  making \nfinancial  assistance  available  to CHA  \"in  connection with \nor  in  support  of  the  racially discriminatory  aspects\"  of \nChicago's  public  housing  system.  (Would  HUD  suggest  that it \nhas  a  contractual  obligation  to  fund  an  unconstitutional \ncontinuation  of  the  discriminatory  aspects  of  CHA's  housing \nprogram?)  In  other words,  as  HUD  only  partly  acknowledges, \nwe  have  not  soughยทt  and  do  not  seek  to  interfere in  any  way \nwith  HUD 's  solemn  obligations  to  CHA  or bondholders . \n(2)  An  Order  Against  HUD  Will  not Affect  its \n~ost of  Money. \nHUD  also  asserts  that  \"any  injunction based  upon \nthe  administration  by  HUD  of  the  federally  assisted  low-rent \nhousing  program  has  an  immediate  and  an  escalating  effect \nupon  the  cost of money  for  the  entire  program. \"  (HUD  br .  16 . ) \nExhibits  are  supplied which  show  the  extent  of  HUD  financing \nof  low-rent housing  programs  throughout  the  country.  (HUD \nExhibits  D  and  E.) \nSince ,  as  just noted,  no  injunction  against  the \nexpenditure  of  HUD  funds  to  finance  CHA's  existing program  is \nsought ,  HUD's  argument would  be  irrelevant even  if it were \nvalid .  However,  this  particular scare  argument  did  not \ndissuade  the  court in Hicks  v.  Weaver  from  entering  an  order \n-30-\n\nwhich  enjoined  HUD  from  expending  funds  with  respect  to  the \nproposed  unconstitutional  portion  of  the  Bogal usa,  Louisiana \nprogram,  without  interfering with  HUD's  continued  financing \nof  the  previously  constructed  Bogalusa  projects .  The  ef fect \nof  the  order  in  the  Hicks  case,  whi ch  was  entered  on  31, \n~ay \n1969,  was  apparently  less  than  disastrous  because  some  6 \nmonths  later HUD  decided  to  dismiss  its appeal ,  leaving  the \norder  against  it still in  effect.* \n(3)  The  Discretionary Allocation  of  Funds  is  not \nInvolved. \nHUD  implies  that  the  order we  seek will  usurp  the \nprerogative  of  the  Secretary  to  determine  what  portion of \nHUD's  congressionally  appropriated  funds  is  to  be  allocated \nto  the  Chicago  area,  and  suggests  the  spectre  of  Courts \nacross  the  land  hastening  to  enter  decrees  to  protect  alloca-\ntions  of  funds  for  their  communities.  (HUD  br .  24 ;  see  also \n*Order  of  Dismissal  entered  by  the  Fifth Circuit  Court  of \nAppeals  on  December  17,  1969,  Appeal  No.  28267,  pursuant  to \nHUD's  motion  filed  on  December  1,  1969.  HUD  seeks  to \ndistinguish  Hicks  because  the  only  injunctive order  so  far \nentered  in  that  case  is  temporary F  not  permanent.  The \ninjunctive  order  in  Hicks  has  already been  in effect  for \nmany  months  and  we  are  advised  that a  permanent  hearing  is \nnot set even  yet.  But  apart  from  this  it may  be  doubted  that \nthe  distinction  between  a  temporary  and  permanent  injunction \nwould  have  any  significance  in  the  HUD  money  market  if, \nindeed ,  \"any  injunction based  upon  the  administration  by \nHUD  of  the  federally  assisted  low-rent  housing  program  has \nan  immediate  and  an  escalating effect upon  the  cost of \nmoney o\"  (HUD  br.  16 o) \n-31-\n\nHUD  br o  21 o) \nNothing  we  have  said  or  implied  justifies  HUD  in \nattributing  to  us  such  a  motive.  Just  as  in  the  companion \ncase,  where  the  order  sought  to  provide  a  remedy  within  the \nframework  of  funds  available  to  CHA  and  dealt  solely with \nthe  utilization  of  those  funds so  here  the  remedy  will  be \n1 \nframed  with  respect  to  that  portion of  HUD's  resources  which \nthe  Secretary has  in  his  discretion  determined  to  allocate \nto  the  Chicago,  Illinoi s  Housing  Market  area.* \n(4)  Dictation  of  Sites  by  the  Federal  Government \nis not  Involved. \nA  like bogeyman  is HUD's  assertion  that,  \"Nothing \nwould  be  more  catastrophic  than  to  have  the  Federal  Government \ndictate  the  sites  for  low-rent  publ ic housing  in  the  areas \ncovered  by  the  more  than  2,500  housing  authorities  presently \nin  the  program. \"  (HUD  br.  l5 o)**  The  implication  is  that we \n*The  cases  cited  by  HUD  (HUD  br.  21)  are  inapposite.

None  presents \nthe  question  of  the  power  of  a  federal  court to order  federal \nadministrators  to  remedy  constitutional wrongs  which  they \nhave  committed.  See  Part III,  infra. \n**Why  nothing  would  be  more  catastrophic does  not  appear. \nExisting  site  selecti on  policies  may  not  be  the  very  best \nthat  could  be  devised.  Of  the  quarter  of  a  million  public \nhousing  units  constructed  in  the  nation's  24  largest metro \npolitan areas,  only  76  (and  these  in only  one  metropolitan \narea)  have  been  built outside  central  cities .  \"In  effect, \n(Continued  on  next  page) \n-32-\n\nseek  of  sites  by  the  federal  government. \n\"dictation'~ \nWe  have  not  asked  for  such  an  order  in Chicago,  let \nalone  throughout  the  country .

We  are  satisfied  that  the  object criteria \napproach  which  was  utilized  in  the  companion  case  is  preferable \nto  that  solution,  and  it is more  than  slightly  unfair  of HUD \nto  accuse  us  of  advocating  the  precise opposite  of  the  type \nof  approach  which  HUD  knovls  us  to  have  sponsored. \n(5)  The  Allegedly  Disastrous  Consequences  for  the \nAdministration  of  the  Housing  Titles  of  the \nCivil  Rights  Acts  of  1964  and  1968  are \nImaginary. \nHUD  implies  that we  are  asking  the  Court  to  \"wrest \ncontrol\"  from  the  Secretary  of  his  \"vast  civil  rights \nresponsibilities\"  (HUD  br.  20)  and  says  that  the  entry of  a \njudgment  against  the  Secretary would  have  \"disastrous \nconsequences  for  the  administration  of  the  housing  titles of \n(Continued  from  previous  page) \ntherefore,  the  public  housing  program  has  served  to  intensify \nthe  concentrations  of  the  poor  and  the  nonwhite  in  the  central \ncity. \"  U.S.  Commission  on  Civil  Rights,  Racial  Isolation in \nthe  Public  Schools  {U.S.  Govt.

Let  us  be . \nat  a  level  of  dialogue  not  found  in  HUD's  brief , \nBu~, \nsome  portion  of  this  plea  must  be  seriously  dealt with. \nThere  is  a  tradition of  non-interference  by  the  judiciary \nwith  the  discretion  of  administrative  officials \"  What  is \n-36-\n\nto  be  said  of  that?* \nFirst,  it should  be  noted  that  the  tradition  itself \nis  increasingly  questioned.  Indeed,  the  necessity  of  subjecting \nthe modern  federal  grant programs  to  the  rule  of  law  was \nprecisely  the  theme  of  the  recent  proceedings  of  the  National \nInstitute on  Federal  Urban  Grants .  One  of  HUD's  own  officials \nset  the  stage : \n\"During  the  latter part of  the  nineteenth \ncentury  and  the  early  decades  of  thi s  century , \nFederal  and  state  legislation  to  promote \nhealth  and  welfare  was  based  principally on \nthe  Federal  power  over  interstate  commerce  and \nthe  state police  power,  and  was  correspondingly \ndirected more  toward  regulation  than  toward \nfinancial  support.  In  recent  decades,  partic \nularly  the  1960's,  we  have  witnessed  increasing \nreliance  by  the  Federal  government,  and  to  a \nlesser extent  the  states ,  on  financial  support \nthrough  grants  based  upon  the  general welfare \nclauses  of  the  Federal  and  state Constitutions . \n\"The  bench  and  bar  have  been  sl ow,  however, \nin  reacting  to  the  implications  of  this  shift. \nRelatively  little attention  has  been  focused  on \nthe  control  of  administrative  discretion  in \ngrant  programs  . . . \"** \n*One  thing  to  be  said  is  that HUD's  plea  to  be  let alone  is \npremature.  We  seek  at  this  point  only  the  granting of our \nmotion  for  summary  judgment,  not  the  entry  of  a  final \njudgment  order.  HUD  will  have  ample  opportunity  in  the \nworking  out  of  the  provisions  of  that order  to  raise \nquestions  concerning  its discretion.

The  United  States  Department  of Agriculture, \ntogether with  the  other  Federal  defendants  herein, \ntheir  successors,  agents  and  employees,  shall  immed \niately put  into effect,  in  the  shortest  time  feasible \nand  at Federal  expense,  the  Commodity  Distribution \nProgram  in every  Texas  area  that has  no  Food  Stamp \nProgram.  , .. \n\"2.

So  long  as  the  State  of Texas  chooses  to  parti \ncipate  in  the  Family  Food  Assistance  Programs,  the \nState  defendants  must  include  every  Texas  area  in  either \nthe  Food  Stamp  or  Commodity  Distribution  Program. \" \nt l0,790,  at p.ll,629 . \nIt is  notable  that  this  relief was  given  in  a  case  involving \nonly  statutory,  not  constitutional ,  violations . \n-40-\n\nJudge  Harold  Leventhal  of  the  Court  of Appeals  for  t he \nDistrict of  Columbia  Circuit  addressed  himself  to  the  plea \nof  the  administrators  to  be  let alone .  He  said: \n11The  government  administrators  have  said  from \nthe  very  beginning  that  you  really  cannot \nbring  us  in  and  ask  us  what  we  are  doing, \nbecause  we  are  the  government  and  the  govern \nment  is  immune  from  suit,  one  way  or  the \nother. \n\"There  are  many  doctrines ,  but  they  have \nthat  feature  in  common.  And  the  courts, \nusually  citing,  or perhaps  citing precedents \nthat go  back  as  far  as  Coke,  and  even  Bracton, \nhave  said  that  the  King  is  not  above  the \nlaw. \n\"Now,  there  have  been  areas  which  were \nput  forward  as  being without  the  proper \ncognizance  of  the  judiciary,  and  I  think we \nhave  seen,  say,  over  the  last 30  years,  at \nleast,  maybe  more  than  that,  that these \nbastions  of  immunity  from  judicial  analysis \nhave  fallen .  โข . . \n;'Now,  I  would  say  this  is  even  true,  by \nthe way,  today  in  such  areas  as  were  recently \nthought  to be  completely  immune  from  court \nanalysis,  such  as  prison discipline  - so  far, \nonly  on  constitutional  grounds,  e.g. ,  the \nBlack  Muslims  say  that  they  are  being  dis \ncriminated  against  because  of  their  religion . \nBut  nevertheless ,  the  courts  on  thaยทt  basis \nare  even  getting  into  considering questions \nof  prison  management.\"  Panel  Discussion,  22 \nAd .  Law  Rev.  235- 36 . \nJudge  Leventhal  summed  up  his  views  succinctly ~ \n\" ...  [TJhe  law  of  judicial  review  has  progressed \nto  a  point where  it will  not  be  deterred  by \nblatant hanky-panky.\"  Id.  255. \n- 41-\n\nHUD 1s  second-in-co~nand ,  Under  Secretary  Richard C. \nVanDusen,  made  some  candid  observations.  'ยท [W]e  must \nrecognize  the  inadequacy  of  the  system  to  deal  with  the \nproblems.\"  Id.  174.  He  said  that  the  \"web  of  federal \nprograms  has  grown  so  tangled  that  localities  often  cannot \nfigure  out which  way  to  turn , \"  and  that he  had  been  \"startl ed \nto  discover  how  little we  do  in  the way  of  performance \nevaluation. \"  Id.  175 .  He  concluded  that  the  opportunity \nwith which  federal  officials  are  presented  is  not  to  arrest \nwhat  he  acknowledged  to  be  the -erosi on  of  the  doctrine  of \nsovereign  immunity,  but  to  \"redistribute  a  sovereignty which \nhas  become  overcentralized  and  unresponsive.'  Id.  180.  Mr. \nVan  Dusen  may  not  have  meant  to  include  the  courts  in  such  a \nredistribution  (although  the  courts,  not  the  administrators, \nhave  done  the  eroding  of which  he  speaks  approvingly) ,  but \nit is  submitted  that,  until  an  effective  alternative  is \nsuggested,  we  will  either  have  an  overcentralized  and \nunresponsive  federal  bureaucracy,  or we  will  have  judicial \nreview. * \nFinally,  whatever  one's  views  of  these  developments  in \nthe  law  of  judicial  review,  we  deal  in  this  case  with  a  very \n*\"Judicial  review  obtains  not  only  to  advance  what  have \ntraditionally been  viewed  as  'legal  rights,'  but  also  to \nvindicate  the  public  interest  .โข. \" Norwalk,  supra,  395  F.2d \nat  934 . \n- 42-\n\nprecise  and  circumscribed  situation with  respect  to  which \njudicial  supervision  of  administrative  action,  even  if viewed \ndistastefully,  is mandated  by  basic  principl es  of  equity. \nHere  we  deal  not with  the  discretionary  administration  of  a \nbenign  federal  program  but with  the  mandatory  redress  of \nconstitutional wrongs.  We  may  put  to  one  side  the  question \nof  the  proper  scope  to  be  allowed  federal  officials  in  the \nongoing  administration  of  a  federal  program  absent \nconstitutional wrongdoing.  Surely  it is  right and  proper \nfor  the  courts  to  lay  down  some  guidelines  and  to  insist on \nsome  \"performance  evaluation\"  when  it has  been  established \nthat  the  administrators  have  committed  constitutional \nwrongs  which  they  are  obligated  to  remedy.  Surely  the \nadministrator  has  not  an  equal  claim  to  discretion  in  each \nsituation.  \" [C]ourts  do  not  credit  administrative  agencies \nwith  any  special  expertise where  constitutional  rights  are \ninvolved.\"  New  Sovereign  Immunity,  81  Harv.  L.  Rev.  942. \nMoreover,  the  vindication  and  enforcement  of  federal \nconstitutional  rights  is  one  of  the  central  functions  of  the \nfederal  judiciary. \n1The  judiciary is  an  indispensable  part of  the \n'\noperation  of  our  federal  system.  With  the \ngrowing  complexities  of  government  it is often \nthe  one  and  only  place  where  effective  relief \ncan  be  obtained  [W)here  wrongs  to  individuals \nooโข \n-43-\n\nare  done  by  violation of  specific \nguarantees ,  it is  abdication  for  courts \nto  close  their doors .\"  Flast v.  Cohen, \n---\n392  U.S.  at  111  (concurring  opinion) . \nIt would  be  an ยทironic  inversion  of  priorities  if  the  demand \nof  the  administrator  for  unchecked  discret ion were  to  render \nthe  judiciary powerless  with  respect  to  so  central  a  judicial \nfunction  as  remedying  constitutional wrongs . \nThe  courts  themselves  have  not  adopted  so  niggardly  a \nview  of  their FOWers ,  even  when  t he  political  branches  of \ngovernment  are  themselves  directly  i nvolved,  provided  there \nhas  been  a  constitutional wrong  which  needs  The \nr~ghting. \nlegislative  reapportionment  cases  ar e  \"a  classic  enunciation \nof  an  affirmative  duty  i mposed  by  t he  judiciary  on  the \npolitical  branches  of  government ,\"  where  imposition  of  such \na  duty  has  been  necessary  t o  remedy  constitutional \ndee~ed \nwrongs .*  HOi:l  much  clearer  i t  is  t.~~a t  t he  co'-lrt.s  wi 11  act \nwhen  the  constituticnal wrongdoers  &re  adwinistrators  who \nhave  abused  the  discretion  with  w!1ich  the  legislature  entrusted \nthem. \nWe  seek  an  exercise  of  the  traditional  power  of  an \nequity  court  to  fashion  a  decree  to  fit a  particular  situation \nto  the  end  of  granting  complete  relief  - here,  \"to  render  a \n..  *Arthur  Selwyn  Miller,  Toward  a  Concept  of  Constitutional \nDuty,  1968  Supreme  Court  Review  199,  218 . \n- 44-\n\ndecree  which  will  so  far  as  possible  eliminate  the  discrimina-ยท \ntory  effects  of  the  past.\"  Louisiana v .  United  States,  380 \nU.S.  145,  154  (1965) .  In  this  case  such  discriminatory \neffects  have  been  brought  about  by  the  unconstitutional \nexercise  of  discretionary  powers  by  government  administrators . \nThose  same  administrators  are  now  saying  to  this  Court  of \nequity  that  it may  not  direct  the  employment  of  those  powers \nfor  the  specific  purpose  and  t o  the  limited  end  of eliminating \nthose  discriminatory  effects  because  to  do  so  would  hamper \ntheir discretion.  We  trust  that  the  value  system which \nproduces  t hat  judgment  about what  is  important in our  society \nis not  shared  by  t his Court. \nIV.  IT  IS  TO  DEAL  NOW  WITH  THE  PRECISE  FORM  OF \nPRE~~TURE \nULTIMATE  RELIEF. \nHUD  accuses  us  of  being  \"coy\"  in  suggesting  that  the \nCourt  invite  HUD  to  propose  the  form  of  an  order.  (HUD  br. \n23 0) \nThere  is nothing  coy  about  that suggestion.  In  a  wide \nvariety  of  cases ,  of which  the  school  desegregation  cases  are \nonly  one  example,*  courts,  having  found  liability on  the  part \n*\"The  burden  on  a  school  board  today  is  to  come  forward  with  a \nplan  that promises  realistically  to work,  and  promises \nrealistically  to work  now.\"  Green  v.  County  School  Bd.  of \nNew  Kent  Co.,  Va.,  391  U.S.  430 ,  439  (1968) . \n- 45-\n\nof  the  defendant,  have  requested  the  defendant  to  propose  the \nform  of  remedial  order.  This  is precisely  the  procedure \nwhich  the Court  followed  in  the  companion  case .  See \nGautreaux  v .  CHA ,  296  F .Supp.  907,  914 . \nWe  would  expect  to  play  a  constructive  role  in  the \nformulation  of  such  an  order  once  HUD 1s  proposal  had  been \nsubmitted  to  the  Court  (or ,  indeed,  to  attempt  to  work  out \nan  agreed  order with  HUD) .  Several  of  the  amici,  bearing \nimpressive  housing  credentials,  have  offered  assistance. \nAgain ,  the  companion  case  is  instructive.  The  process  of \ndecree  preparation  there  involved  a  developing  interchange \nof  ideas  and  suggestions  participated  in  by  the  parties, \nthe  Court  and  outside  experts,  based  upon  initial proposals \nof  the  parties .* \n*We  must  comment,  however f  upon  HUD 1s  statement  that  a \nsuggestion made  by  one  of  the  amici  is misguided  and  would \n11paral yze 11  certain housing  programs.  (HUD  br.  24 . )  'rhe \nassertion  of  paralysis  appears  nakedly  without  any  supporting \nargument;  presumably  the  Court  is  simply  to  accept  HUD's \nword.  The  suggestion  is  said  to be  misguided  because  the \nprograms  referred  to  - moderate  income  programs  - are  said  to \nserve  only  persons  above  the  maximum  income  l imits  for \nadmission  to  low-rent  housing  and  not  the  income  group  of \nwhich  plaintiffs  are  a  part .  (HUD  br.  24 . )  However,  as  the \nbrief of  the  amicus  noted,  these  moderate  income  programs  are \nin part made  available  to  the  income  group  of which  the \nplaintiffs  are  a  part.

I  aa the Deputy Regional Administrator of Region  IV,  Department  of Housing \nand Urban Development,  a  Department  of  the Executive Branch  of the United States. \nIn the absence of  Francis D.  Fisher,  Regional Administrator,  Region IV,  Department \nof Housing and Urban Development,  I  serve as the Ac~ing Regional Administrator. \n2.  As  Regional Administrator,  Francis D.  Fisher has  general supervision over \nthe administration of the various  progra.a of the Department  of Housing and Urban \nDevelopnent in Region IV  thereof which  Region  includes,  aaong other states,  the \nentire State of Illinois.  His  supervision of this function is by virtue of various \nOrganizational Orders and Delegations  of Authority from the Secretary of the \nDepartment  of Housing and Urban Development. \n3.  The  information set forth below ha-e  been compiled by the Regional Office \nstaff of Region  IV  in accordance with and pursuant  to ~ direction for the purposes \nof providing this Court with updated  information with respect to (1)  events  relating \nto the  Chicago Housing Authority since the entry of  the Judgment  Order in the case \nof Dorothy Gautreaux,  Odell Jones,  Doreatha R.  Crenchaw,  Eva  Rodgers,  James  Rodgers, \nRobert M.  Fairfax and Jimmie  Jones,  Plaintiffs, v.  The  Chicago Housing Authority, \na  corporation, and  c.  E.  HWIIphrey,  Executive Director,  Defendants,  Civil Action \n'{o.  66  C 1459;  and (2)  other efforts on  the part of the Department  of Housing and \n..srban Develo~nt (HUD)  to advance the  purposes of desegregation and low  income \nhousing production. \nI.  Events  related to the Chicago  Housing Authority \n(a)  The  Chicago Housing Authority received a  program reservation froa \nHUD  for 3,000 units,  1500 family and 1500  elderly,  on Septeโขber B, \nl.96jยท.  1he Autb.lrity su't:.wlrltl;ed  ~o RUD  a  :.i.ist of proposed  sites for \nthe family units, which would  support approximately 2000  units. \nThese sites are all in the \"general public housing area\".  The \nRegional Office found acceptable sites for approximately 1300 units \nand identified additional sites, for CHA1s  consideration, which \nwere not  included in the Authority's list.  Sites submitted b,y  CHA \nfor approximately 700 units were  found  by the Regional Office to be \nunsuitable.  The  remaining sites for 1300 units  should be sufficient \nfor implementation of the 1500 unit reservation,  since the  remaining \n200 units can be  built in the limited public housing area.  CHA  has \nnot formally submitted a  development  program for  either the family \nor elderly units.  The  proposals must  be  approved by the City  Council \nbefore formal  submission  to HUD. \nPage 1  of  4 Pages \n\n(b)  The  Cook  County Housing Authority received a  progr-am  r eservation \nfroa HUD  for the unincorporated areas of the county for 1500 f&lli.ly \nand  500  elderly units,  on September 3, 1969.  The Authority has not \nas yet submitted a  development program. \n(c)  The  Chicago Housing Authority received approval for 20  million \ndollars of modernization funds  in May  1968.  Initial funcU ng \nvas approximately $10 million (allocated September 30,  1968) \nand the remaining  $1.0  mUlion was allocated June 30,  1969.  The \nAuthority is proceeding satisfactorily with this modernization \neffort.-\n(d)  The  Chicago Housing Authority has  2500 units under contract under \nHUDโขs  Section 23  leasing program.  As  of  March 1, 1970,  2156  of \nthese units were leased, with a  racial breakdown of 1760 white \nfaailies and 396 black families.  Approval has been given by Judge Austin \nto lease 250 units at Cottage Grove, within the limited public housing area. \nHUD  has agreed,  by letter, to provide  the Chicago Housing Authority \nwith 3.50 additional units under the leasing program. \n(e)  HUD  has  received and accepted a  study by the Real Estate Research \nCorporation of Chicago  to design criteria for selecting housing  sites \nfor low and moderate inc011e  households  in certain parts of the \nChicago area.  The areas considered cover the County of  Cook,  including \nthe City of Chicago and a  tier of townships adjacent  to that county \nexclusive of those in Indiana.  This  report will provide a  basis for \nproviding a  significantly increased volume  of low and moderate income \nhousing throughout the Chicago area.  HUD  Regional staff is currently \ninvestigating alternative methods for pursuing the second stage of \nsearching for actual sites, i.eo,  identifying appropriate areas and \nsuitable specific sites in the metropolitan area. \n(f)  HUD  is attempting to involve the state of Illinois in joint efforts \nto approach the problem of low and moderate income housing on a \n11etropolitan Cl;licago  basiso  As  a  first step,  the Illinois Housing \nand Development Authority participated with HUD  and CHA  in the \nsponsorship of the design study by the Real Estate Research Corporation. \n{g)  The Northeastern Illinois Planning  Calllll:ission (NIPC),  fuDded under \nHUDโขs  Section 701  Planning  Program,  has  in its work program under \ntakings which should increase housing opportunities for low and \nmoderate income  fa.miliess \n( 1)  A 'review of all buildings and  zoning codes  in. six northeastern \nIllinois counties,  to determine where restrictions exist which \nunreasonably raise the cost of housing,  thus  excluding low and \nmoderate income families; \n(2)  Performing a  clearing house function for non-profit and other \ndevelopers  of low and moderate income housing,  including \ncataloguing sources of financing and technical assi stance. \n(h)  (SEE  BELOW) \nII.  Other .HUD  effoGs to advance the purposes of desegregation and low-income \nhousing production \n.. \n..  ... \n~ยทi  HUD  co~~r.acted with ยท&he  L~ยทยท eadership  Council for Metropoli~ Open \nCoamm:ities  in 1966,  funding. the  organization! s  efforts to assist \nBlack homeseek~rs to obtain housing accommodations  outside the ghettps \nof the metropolitan a.J\"ea.  The Leโขdership. Council's original proposal \nto HUD  contemplated placing minority families  in non-ghetto housing by \n!!!.!. means,  while the  contract currently in effect focuses  on \"working \nwith the minority home-seekers and a  black real estate board to change \nthe practices of real estate boards and multiple listing services in \nwhite CODIIIIWlities  with the aim of filing legal action in the Federal \nDistrict Court and  complaints with HUD  in instances where discrimination \nis found\". \n(h)  The  Court-ordered tenant-assignment plan has been in effect since \nFebruary 1, 1970. \nPage 2  of 4 Pages \n\n(b)  On  March  24, 1969,  complaints charging discrimination against \nNegro homebuyers were filed with HUD  aga~qt 14 west suburban \nreal estate brokers.  HUD1s  Equal Opportunity Office investigated \nthe matter and turned over its fundings  to the Justice Department \nfor prosecution.  The  Justice Department filed suit on July 14, \n1969,  against the West Suburban Board of Realtors of Cook  County, \nIllinois, under Sections 804 and 806 of the 1968 Housing Act , \nalleging:  (1)  the existence of a  pattern of practice of resistance \nto open housing and  (2)  charging that Negroes were denied access \nto .ultiple listing services. \nThe  litigation was  resolved by a  consent decree, under which the \nWest  Suburban Board of Realtors agreed to:  (1)  allow blacks \ninto membership in the multiple listing service, by giving access \nto the Realty Board,  and  (2)  refrain from violating Title VIII \nof the 1968 Housing Act. \n(c)  HUD1s  Equal Opportunity Office is processing approx~tely \n60  complaints of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing \nin the City of Chicago, under Title VIII of the 1968 Housing Act. \nIn addition,  this Office is investigating approximately seven \nc011plaints from suburbs  of Chicago under the same  statute. \n(d)  HUD1s  Equal Opportunity Office has  investigated the case of a \ndeveloper in Aurora,  Illinois, who  has bid on a  public housing \n\"turnkey\" project  but was  previously placed on the FHA  sanction \nlist for refusing to rent or sell his FliA-insured units to Negroes. \nA conciliation agreement has been signed, which affects all of \nthe developer's  holdings and in which he agreed to an affinnative \naction program in employment and the development  of a  tenant \nselection plan in conformity with Title VIII for tlis and future \nprojects. \nThe  Equal Opportunity Office has developed broad language which \nis being used on turnkey developers 1  disclosure statements in \norder to discover possible civil rights violations. \n(e)  HUD1s  Equal Opportunity Office is rendering technical assistance \nto the  City of  Chicago  in regard t o  its Commission on Human  Relations. \nAs  a  result of experience with the Chicago Model  Cities program, \nHUD  discovered several parts of the Commission's  governing ordinance \nwhich could be strengthened.  HUD1s  EX.>  Office is giving assistance \nto the  city in recommending appropriate amendments  to this legislation \nwhich will strengthen the  Commission's  role. \n(f)  Aurora has  43  units under contract under HUD1s  Section 23  leasing \nprogram and as of March 15,  1970, all 43  units were leased.  The \napproximate racial breakdown of the tenants was  27  Black,  ll Whit e, \nand 5 Spanish-Anaerican. \nElgin has  50  leased units under contract.  As  of DecEIIlber  30, 1969, \n25 were leased and the racial breakdown was  9 White,  15  Black,  and \n1  other. \nEvanst on has 100 units under contract.  Two  of theEle  units  have  been \nl eas,;Q,  most will be l eased during 1970. \n~JUt \n-\nP.age  3 of 4 Pages \n\n(g)  Under  Section 22l(d)(3)  of the 1961 Housing Act,  HUD  has  assisted \nin the development  of approximately 7,374 units of low and \nmoderate-income cooperative and rental housing  in Chicago and \n6,699 of such units  in the area surrounding  Chicago.  Although \nthis program was  initiated in 1961,  most  of  the  construction has \nbeen in the last several years  (breakdowns  of all subsidized \nprograms  by individual project are available if needed) โข \n(h)  Allocations for development  of low and moderate-income  rental \nhousing under Section 236  of the 1968 Housing  Act  have  been made \nas follows:  (a)  Chicago  - 1,934 units;  (b)  Chicago area outside \nthe  city - 1,115 units.  Some  of these projects are already under \nconstruction and  several more will be under  construction very \nshortly. \n(i)  Allocations for development  of low and moderate-income housing \nunder Section 235  (home  ownership)  of the 1968 Housing Act have \nbeen made  as follows:  (a)  Chicago  - l,o63 units;  (b)  Chicago \narea outside the city - 4,179 units.  Some  of  these projects are \nalready under construction and several more will be under con \nstruction very shortly. \n(j)  HUD  has  been able to secure acceptance by the  City of Evanston \nof the rent supplement  program as a  relocation resource in \ncases  of public displacement. \n.

ROMNEY, \nDefendant-Appellee. \nOn- Appeal  from  the  Judgment  of  the  United  States \nDistrict Court  for  the  Northern  District of  Illinois \n..... \nBRIEF  FOR  THE  APPELLANTS \n..... \nSTATEMENT  OF  THE  ISSUE  PRESENTED \nWhether  the  District Court  erred  in  dismissing  the \naction  under  the  following  circumstances: \n(l}  The  ยทDefendant,  George  Romney,  Secretary  of \nthe  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment,  knew  that  the  Chicago  Housing \nAuthority,  a  local  public  housing  authority, \n\nwas  carrying  on  a  de  jure  racially  segregated \npublic  housing  system_;_  _ \n(2)  The  Defendant  nonetheless  continued  for  many \nyears  to  give  formal  agency  approval  to  the \nracially  discriminatory  actions  of  the  Chicago \nHousing  Authority  and  to  provide  it with \nfunds;  and \n-\n(3}  By  reason  of  such  approvals  and  funds  the \nsegregationist  aspects  of  the  Chicago  public \nhousing  system were  continued  and  expanded. \nSTATEMENT  OF  THE  CASE \nThis  action  against  George  Romney,  Secretary  of  the \nยทDepartment  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (\"HUD\"),  was \nbrought  as  a  companion  case  to  a  separate  action  against \nthe  Chicago  Housing  Authority  ( ''CHA\") ,  a  local  public \nhousing  authority.  Both  actions  charged  that  a  deliberately \nracially  segregated  public  housing  system was  being  carried \non  in Chicago  and  sought  equitable  relief.*  On  the  District \n--\nCourt's  own  motion  this  action was  stayed  pending  disposition \nof  the  companion  CHA  case.  The  staying  order  said  \"the \nallegations  of  the  Complaint  here  are  virtually  identical \nwith  those  presented  by  the  Complaint  in  the  companion  case\" \nand  \"the  determination  of  those  issues  may  render  t hi s  action \nmoot  or  greatly  facilitate  discovery  and  trial of  t he  action.\" \n(A-32.) \n*For  a  succinct  statement  of  \"the  scheme  under  which  public \nhousing  is  provided  in  the  United  States  generally ,\"  see \nKnox  Hill  Tenant  Council  v.  Washington,  F. 2d  (D.C. \nCir.  1971),  slip opinion  pp.2-5. \n-2-\n\n\\ \nOn  February  10,  1969  plaintiff s'  motion  for  summary \njudgment  against  CHA  was  granted.  The  accompanyi ng  opini on, \n296  F.Supp.  907,  found  that CHA  was  deliberately  car rying \non  a  racially  segregated  publi c  housing  syst em  by ,  among \nother  things,  building  public  housing  projects  exclusi vel y \nin  black  areas  of  the  City.  The  Court  found  t hat  99- 1/ 2% \nof  CHA's  more  than  30,000  family  housing  units  wer e  locat ed \nin  areas  which  were  or  soon  would  be  substantially  all \nNegro.  296  F.Supp.  at  910.  It said  that, \n-\n\"It is  incredible  that  this  dismal  prospect \nof  an  all Negro  public  housing  syst em.in \nall Negro  areas  came  about  without  t he \npersistent  application  of  a  deliberat e \npolicy  to  confine  public  housing  t o  al l \nNegro  or  immediately  adjacent  changing \nareas.\"  296  F.Supp.  at  910. \nAnd  it concluded  that  CHA's  site-selection  practices  and \nprocedures  reflected  \"a  deliberate  policy  to  separat e  the  r aces .\" \n296  F.Supp.  at  914.  Relief  against  CHA  was  grant ed  by  a  judgment \norder  entered  on  July  1,  1969.  304  F.Supp.  736. \nCross  motions  for  summary  judgment were  then  filed  in \nthis  act i on. *  The  four  count  compl aint  asserted  t hat HUD 's \napprovals  and  f unding  of  CHA' s  discriminatory  actions  constituted \na  violation  by  HUD  of  t he  Fifth Amendment's  prohibition  against \nr acial discrimination  (Counts  I  and  III)  and  of  Title VI  of \n*HUD' s  motion  t o  dismiss  was  supported  by  affidavits  and  was \nproperly  t r eat ed  as  a  motion  for  summary  judgment  under \nFeder al  Rule  12(b). \n-\n-3-\n\nthe  1964  Civil  Rights  Act,  42  USCA  ยง2000d  (C  unts  II  and \nI \nIV).  The  affidavits  and  briefs  filed  in  connection with  the \n\\ \nmotions  for  summary  judgment  established  two  key  facts: \n1.  HUD  was  fully  aware  of  CHA's  discriminatory \nsite  location  practices  and  indeed  had  sought \nunsuccessfully  over  a  period  of  time  to \npersuade  CHA  to  abandon  them. \n2.  Notwithstanding  such  knowledge,  HUD  continued \nto  approve  CHA's  discriminatori ly  chosen  sites, \nto  participate  in  the  administration  of  the \nsegregated  public  housing  system  in  the  myriad \nways  such  participation  is  provided  for  in  the \nNational  Housing  Act,  and  to  provide  CHA  with \nthe  money  necessary  to  the  carrying  on  and \nenlargement  of  the  Chicago  public  housing  system. \nHUD's  awareness  of  CHA's  discriminatory  site  location \n-\npractices  was  evidenced  in  a  number  of ways:  for  example,  by \nits  rejection  of  a  complaint  that  approval  of  CHA  proposed \nsites would  perpetuate  a  pattern  of  racial  segregation  on \nthe  ground  that  the  Chicago  political  situation gave  CHA  no \nother  (Rec.  Item  33,  Ex.  B,  Letter  dated  October  14, \n1965  of  Public  Housing  Administration),  by  its  efforts  over \nmany  years  \"to  persuade  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority  to \nlocate  low  rent  housing  projects  in white  neighborhoods\" \n(Rec.  Item  52,  Ex.  A,  ,3,  Affidavit  of William  E.  Bergeron), \nby  its  efforts  to  \"block\"  CHA's  \"discriminatory  actions\" \n-\n(Rec.  Item  52,  HUD's  Brief,  p.9),  and  by  its  decision  to \napprove  segregated  housing  rather  than  to  risk  no  housing  at \nall.  (Id.  pp. . l3-13A.)  l:WD  said  it was  faced  with  the  \"tough \ndilemma\"  of  accepting  CHA's  sites,  knowing  \"of  the  City's \n-4-\n\nintention  to  resist desegregation, ..  or,  by  rejecting  them, \nI  .  d \ndepriving  potential  public  housing  tenants  of  lmprove \nI \nshelter.  (Ibid.) \n-\nHUD's  continued  participation  in  and  approval  and  funding \nof  CHA's  discriminatory  site  selection practices  is  equally \nclear  and  uncontradicted.  Although  HUD  did  not  make  the \n-\ninitial  selection  of  sites,  HUD  set  the  site  selection  standards \nand  criteria with which  CHA  was  required  to  comply,  and  had \nand  exercised  the  power  to  approve  or  disapprove  every  site \nselected  by  CHA.  Thus  HUD's  trial  court  briefs  state: \n\"In  practical  operation  of  the  low-rent \nhousing  program,  the  existence  of  the  program  is \nentirely  dependent  upon  continuing,  year  to  year, \nFederal  financial  assistance.\"  (Rec.  Item  20, \nHUD's  Memorandum,  p.5.)* \n\" ...  HUD  also  requires  Housing  Authorities \nto  execute  and  record  Declarations  of  Trust  in \nfavor  of  HUD  and  its Note  or  Bondholders  on  all \nproject  property,  both  real  and  personal,  and  on \nall  income ,  rents,  revenues ,  or  other  personalty \nheld  or  used  or  derived  from  the  projects.\"  (Id. \npp. 6-7.) \n\"Upon  failure  to  live  up  to  the  requirements \nof  the  Federal  law  or  certain  provisions  of  the \nAnnual  Contributions  Contract  ...  t he  Federal \nGovernment  reserves  the  right  to  demand  title or \npossession  of  the  projects .\"  (Id.  p.6 .) \n-\n*A  1966  affidavit  filed  by  HUD  discloses  that  since  1950 \nHUD  had  spent  nearly  350  million  dollars  in  financing \nCHA  projects .and  that  in  1965  HUD  had  paid  96 .67% of  the \ndebt  service  on  CHA  projects.

McGuire,  dated  November  9,  1966 ,  10  and  12 .) \n-5-\n\n\"HUD,  under  the  Annual  Contributions  Contract, \nrequires  certain  approvals  by  it of  some  of  t he \nactions  taken  by  the  Housing  Authorities.

Part  Two  is  a  56  page \nprinted  booklet  (plus  a  15  page  index)  containing  ninety-\nseven  different  sections,  each  dealing with  a  separate \nsubject.  A  random  sample  of  a  dozen  of  the  section  headings \nfollows: \nSec. \n101  Efficiency  and  Economy  in  Development \n103  Acquisition  of  Project  Sites \n106  Architectural  and  Engineering  Services \n121  Fees  for  PHA  Representatives  at Project  Sites \n206  Eligibility  for Admission \n208  Tenant  Selection \n213  Repair,  Maintenance,  and  Replacement \n306  Procurement \n307  Personnel \n309  Books  of  Account  and  Records \n404  Development  Cost  Budgets \n509  Rights  of  PHA  to  Terminate  Contract \nThese  contractual  provisions  are  supplemented  by  volumi nous \nregulations  which  HUD  issues  from  time  to  time .

Item  29,  Attachment  to  BUD ' s  Second \nSupplemental  Memorandum. ) \n-7-\n\nThe  cross  motions  for  summary  judgment  were  disposed  of \nby  orders  entered  on  September  1  and  October  21,  1970,  which \ndenied  plaintiffs'  motion,  granted  HUD's  motion  and  dismissed \nthe  action.  56.)  The  District Court's  memorandum \nopinion,  which  accompanied  the  September  l  order,  determined \nt hat  plaintiffs  had  standing  to  sue  (A-37)  and  that  the \njurisdictional  amount  required  under  28  U.S.C.  ยง1331  was \npresent.  (A-38-39.)  The  Court  said  however  that Count  I \nfailed  \"to  state  a  claim  over  which  this  court  has  power  to \nexerci se  jurisdiction  or  to  grant  relief\"  because  Count  I \nwas  rested  solely  on  the  Fifth Amendment  and  \"the  Fifth \nAmendment  in  the  circumstances  here  alleged  by  this  sui t  does \nnot  authorize  suit  against  the  defendant  Secretary  and  the \ngeneral  federal  question  jurisdiction  section  does  not  confer \nauthority  for  such  suit. ''  (A-43.)  Count  II  was  said  to  have \nfailed  to  state  a  clai m  upon  which  r elief  could  be  granted. \n(A-49.)  Finally,  both  Counts  were  said  to  be  addit ionally \ndefective  because  they  foundered  on  t he  rock  of  sovereign \nimmunity.  (A-50.)  (Counts  III  and  IV,  identical  to  Counts \nI  and  II,  r espectively ,  except  that  they  did  not  allege  purpose-\nful  discrimination,  were  dismissed  as  well  for  their  failure \nto  make  that  al legation.  A-36-37. ) \nThe  notice  of  appeal  was  filed  on  October  29,  1970.  (A-57.) \n-8-\n\nSUMMARY  OF  ARGUMENT \nThe  complaint  alleges,  and  the  and  briefs \nI \nfiled  below  show  without  dispute:  (1)  the  public  housing \nsystem  in Chicago  was  de  jure  raGially segregated;  (2)  HUD \nknew  it;  (3)  HUD  tried  and  failed  to  persuade  CHA  to  end \nits  segregation  practices;  and  (4)  possessing  such  know-\nledge  and  notwithstanding  such  fail ure  HUD  continued, \nadministratively  and  financially,  to  approve  and  participate \nin  the  carrying  on  and  expansion  of  the  segregated  Chicago \npublic  housing  system. \nThese  undisputed  facts  show  a  violation  of  the  Fifth \nAmendment  prohibition  against  racial  discrimination by  a \nfederal  agency  over  which  the  District Court  has  jurisdiction. \nThey  also  show  a  violation of  the  prohibi tion  of  Title  VI \nof  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  against  racial  discrimination \nin  any  program  or  activity  receiving  federal  financial \nassistance.  Neither  action  is  barred  by  the  doctrine  of \nsovereign  immunity. \nARGUMENT \nWe  will  deal  i n  order  with  the  t hree  grounds  for  the \nDi strict Court ' s  decision  to  dismi ss  the  action :  di smissal  of \nCount  I  for  lack  of  jurisdiction ,  of  Count  II  for  f ailure  to \nstate  a  claim  upon  which  relief  could  be  granted,  and  of  both \n-9-\n\ncounts  because  of  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity.* \n.....  I  . \nCOUNT  I  STATES  A  CLAIM  OVER \nWHICH  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  HAS \nJURISDICTION  UNDER  28  U.S .C. \nยง1331. \nThe  District Court  apparently  dismissed  Count  I  of  the \nComplaint  because  it viewed  that Count  as  alleging  only \na  violation  of  the  Fifth Amendment  and  not  of\" ...  unauthorized \nor  undelegated  exercises  of  power  under  existent  congressional \nstatutes.\"  (A-42.)  Here  is  the  Court's  specific Count  I \nholding: \n-\n*The  District Court  also  dismissed  Counts  III  and  IV  because \nthose  Counts,  otherwise  identical  to  Counts  I  and  II,  failed \nto  allege  \"intentional  and  deliberate\"  discrimination.  (A-36.) \nThis  was  error.  See,  e.g.,  Green  v.  Kennedy ,  309  F.Supp. \n1127  (D.C.D.C.  1971),  where  the  court  said,  \"We  have  taken \ninto  account  that what  is  involved  in  the  case  before  us  is \nthe  Federal  Government,  and  not  the  States,  and  that  there  is \nno  allegation  or  evidence  that  it is  t he  purpose  of  the \nFederal  statute  or  r egulations  to  foster  segregated  schools . \nThese  considerations  do  not  under cut  the  plaintiffs'  claims \n[T]he  lack  of  segregative  purpose  on  the  part of  the \n-\nGovernment  does  not  avoid  the  constitutional  issue  if the \nGovernment  action materially  supports  a  program  of  school \nsegregation.\"  309  F.Supp.  at  1136;  appeal  dismissed,  398  U.S. \n956  (1970).  See  also,  Southern  Alameda  Spanish  Speaking \nOrganization  v .  City  of  Union  City,  California ,  424  F. 2d  291, \n295  (9th  Cir.  1970). . \nHowever,  since  it is  now  established  that  t he  discrimina-\ntion  in  this. case  was  intentional  and  deliberate,  albeit \nreluctant  (as  t o  CHA  see  296  F.Supp.  at  914;  as  to  HUD  see, \ne.g.,  Rec.  Item  52,  BUD's  Brief,  pp.l3-13A),  we  content \nourselves  in  this  brief with  this  mention  of  the  separate  error \nin dismissing  Counts  III  and  IV. \n-10-\n\n\\ \n\"The  court  holds  that  the  Fifth Amendment \nin  the  circumstances  here  alleged  by  this \nsuit does  not  authorize  suit  against  the \ndefendant  Secretary  and  the  general \nfederal  question  jurisdiction  section  does \nnot  confer  authority  for  such  suit.  There-\nfore,  Count  I  fails  to  state  a  claim  over \nwhich  this  court has  power  to  exercise \njurisdiction or  to  grant  relief  and  the \nsame  is  dismissed.\"  (A-43.) \nThis  holding  is  erroneous  for  two  reasons:  (A)  The \nConstitution  and  28  U.S.C.  ยง1331  do  authorize  actions  based \n.....  solely  on  violations  of  the  Constitution;  and  (B)  In  any  event \nan  unauthorized  (i.e.,  unconstitutional)  exerci se  of  power \nunder  the  National  Housing  Act  is  necessarily  involved  in  the \nallegations  of  Count  I. \nA.  The  District Court  has  Jurisdiction  over  a  Claim Based \nSolely  on  a  Violation  of  the  Fifth Amendment. \nThe  District Court's  holding  as  to  Count  I  is  refuted \nby  the  unambiguous  language  of  the  Constitution  itself,  the \nfederal  judiciary  acts  and  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court. \nThe  Constitution  creates  three  independent  sources  of  federal \n.... \njurisdiction:  constitution,  laws,  and  treaties .  It says \nthat  the  power  of  the  federal  judiciary  extends  to  all  cases \n\"arising  under  this  Constitution,  the  laws  of  the  United \nStates  and  treaties  II  U.S.  Cons t.  Art.  III,  ยง2  (emphasis \nsupplied) .  That  power  is  vested  in  a  Supreme  Court  and \ncongressi onally  established  inferior  courts.  U.S.  Const. \nArt.  III,  ยง1. \n....  -11-\n\nSince  at  least  1801  the  judiciary  acts  ave  vested \nI  โข \njurisdiction  in  the  federal  trial  courts  in  \\ he  same  trl-\npartite  terms.  The  Judiciary Act  of  1801  provided  that, \n...... \n\"[T]he  said  circuit  courts  respectively \nshall  have  cognizance  ...  of  all  cases \n- law  or  equity  arising  under  the \nconstitution  and  laws  of  the  United \nStates  and  treaties  made,  or which  shall \n- be  made,  under  their  authority  ... \" \n2  Stat.  92  (1801)  (emphasis  added). \n'This  pattern has  been  carried  forward  in  every  subsequent \nJudiciary  Act:  Judiciary Act  of  1875,  18  Stat.  470;  Judiciary \n-\nAct  of  1888,  24  Stat.  552;  Judiciary Act  of  1911,  36  Stat. \n1091;  Judiciary Act  of  1948,  62  Stat.  930;  and  the  current \nJudiciary Act  of  1958,  72  Stat.  415,  28  U.S.C.  ยง1331.  The \ncurrent  provision  is: \n\"The  District  courts  shal l  have  original \njurisdiction of  all  civil  actions \nwherein  the  matter  in  controversy  exceeds \nthe  sum  or  value  of  $10,000  exclusive  of \ninterest  and  costs,  and  arises  under  the \nConstitution,  laws ,  or  treaties  of  the \nUnited  States.\"  28  U.S.C.  ยง133l(a). \nThere  have  been  only  minor  language  changes  in  over  a \ncentury  and  a  half,  one  of which  was  to  substitute  \"or\"  for \n\"and\"  between  \"laws\"  and  \"treaties. \"  This  change  made  it \neven  plainer  that  \"arises  under  the  Constitution\"  is  a  separate \nand  independent  source  of  jurisdiction  from  \"laws\"  and \n\"treaties.\" \nAt  leastยท as  early  as  1822  the  United  States  Supreme \nCourt  recognized  that  federal  jurisdiction could  be  rested  on \n-12-\n\nthe  Constitution  alone  (as  distinct  from  legislation passed \nunder  the  authority  of  the  Constitution).  In  Cohens  v. \nVirginia,  19  U.S.  (6  Wheat)  89,  100,  (1822),  Chief  Justice \nMarshall  said: \n\"A  case  in  law  or  equity  ...  may  truly  be \nsaid  to  arise  under  the  constitution  or \na  law  of  the  United  States,  whenever  its \ncorrect  decision  depends  on  the  construction \nof  either. \nThe  jurisdiction of  the  court,  then, \n.... \nbeing  extended  by  the  letter  of  the \nconstitution  to  all  cases  arising  under \nit,  or  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States , \nit follows  that  those  who  would  withdraw  any \ncase  of  this  description  from  that  juris-\ndiction,  must  sustain  the  exemption  they \nclaim  on  the  spirit and  true meaning  of  the \nconstitution,  which  spirit and  true  meaning \nmust  be  so  apparent  as  to  overrule  the  words \nwhich  its  framers  have  employed\"  (emphasis \nsupplied) . \nIn  Bell  v.  Hood,  327  U.S.  678  (1946) an  action  was \n1 \ndismissed  by  the  district court  because  federal  jurisdiction \nwas  rested  solely  on  the  Fourth  and  Fifth Amendments.  The \naction  had  been  brought  under  the  Judiciary Act  of  1911,  36 \n' \nStat.  1091,  which  gave  original  jurisdiction  to  district \ncourts  over  \"all suits  of  a  civil nature,  ...  where  the  matter \nin  contr oversy  ...  arises  under  the  Constitution or  laws  of \nthe  United  States  or  treaties  .. . \"  Affirming  the  trial court \nthe  Court  of Appeals  said:  \"It will  be  noticed  that  Congress \nhas  enacted  no  law  under  the  authority  of  the  constitutional \nprovision  relied  on  by  plaintiffs  as  the  jurisdictional basis  II \n150  F.2d  96,  100  (9th  Cir.  1945).  Reversing,  the  Supreme \n-13-\n\nCourt  said: \nII  [W]here  the  complaint  is  so  drawn  as \nto  seek  r ecovery  directly  under  the \nConstitution or  laws  of  the  United  States, \nthe  federal  court,  but  for  two  possible \nexceptions  later  noted  Iimmateriality  or \nfrivolousness  of  the  Constitutional \nclaim],  must  entertain  the  case.\"  327  U.S. \nat  681-82  (emphasis  supplied). \nAs  the  District Court  here  recognized  (A-40),  Bolling  v. \nSharpe ,  347  u.s.  497  (1953),  is  a  more  recent  illustration \nof  an  exercise  of  jurisdiction based  solely  on  the  Fifth \nAmendment.  The  District Court  distinguished  Bolling because \n-\nof  \"the  unique  status  of  the  District of  Columbia. \"  (A-41.) \n- Why  that  fact  should  make  a  difference  under  the  Fifth \nAmendment  or  under  ยง1331  was  not  explained.  Certainly  there \nis  nothing  in  the  Bolling  opinion  to  support  the  view  that \nthe  Court  had  jurisdiction to  end  racial 'discrimination  by \n...... \nfederal  officials  only  because  their  authority  was  confined \nto  the  District of  Columbia.  (Although  a  jurisdictional \n...... \nquestion was  not  raised  in  Bolling  as  ยทit was  in  Bell,  lack  of \nsubject  matter  jurisdiction  is  of  course  fatal  to  a  court's \nconsideration  of  any  case  and  may  be  raised  by  the  court  sua \nsponte. ) \nCohens ,  Bell  and  Bolling,  as  wel l  as  the  plain  language \nof  28  U.S .C.  ยง1331,  support  jurisdiction  over  Count  I .  We \nhave  found  no  authorities  to  support  t he  District Court 's \ncontrary  view. \n-\n-14-\n\nB.  The  District Court  Clearly  has  Jurisdict1on  Over  a \nFifth Amendment  Claim  Based  on  Defendant's \nUnconstitutional  Performance  of  Statutory  Duties. \nI \nEven  under  the  trial  court's  jurisdictional view,  which \nrequires  an  allegation  of  โขunauthorized  or  undelegated \nexercises.of  power  under  existent Congressional  statutes\" \n(A-42)  as  a  basis  for  federal  court  jurisdiction,  dismissal \nof  Count  I  was  erroneous.  Although  plai ntiffs  are  asserting \nFifth Amendment  rights,  the  nature  of  their  complaint  against \nthe  defendant  is  that he  has  misapplied  or  exceeded  his \nstatutory  authority,  42  U.S.C.  ยง1401  et seq.,  in  violation \n...... \nof  those  rights.  So  i n  Bolling  Court  could  have  focused \non  the  statut ory  authority  under  which  the  defendant  school \nboard  members  were  (unconstitutionally)  acting.  Feder al \n) \nofficials  almost  always  purport  to  act  pursuant  to  statut ory \nauthority.  When  in  such  a  case  they  act  unconstitutionally, \n....... \n\"unauthorized  or  undelegated  exercises  of  power under  existent \nCongressional  statutes\"  are  involved.  Congr ess  rarely \nauthorizes  or  delegates  the  power  to  act  unconstit utional ly , \nand  when  it does  the  constitutionality of  the  statut e  (not  t he \ncase  here  or  in  Bolling)  is  the  i ssue . \nI t  i s  t herefore  clear  t hat  the  Di strict Court ' s  dismissal \nof  Count  I  was  erroneous  both  because  of  the  plain  l anguage \nof  t he  Constitution  and  of  28  U.S.C.  ยง1331,  and  because  the \nDistrict Court's  own  \"premise  for  jurisdiction\"  (A-42)  was  in \nany  event  sat isfied. \n-15-\n\nII. \nCOUNT  II  STATES  A  CLAIM  OF \nVIOLATION  OF  TITLE  42  U.S.C. \nยง2000d  UPON  RELIEF  CAN \nBE  GRANTED. \nCount  II  of  the  Complaint  alleges  a  violation  of  Title \nVI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  ยง2000d,  and \n- rests  jurisdiction on  28  U.S.C.  ยงยง1331  and  1343(4).  The \nDist:rict  Court  said  that  the  \"only  issue\"  as  to  Count  II  was, \n''did  the  continued  approval  and  funding \nof  a  discriminatory  housing  program \nmake  the  defendant  a  joint participant \nin  the  violations  which  CHA  has  been \nfound  to  have  committed;\"  (A-44.) \nThe  Court  answered  that  it did  not,  and  therefore  dismissed \nCount  II โข . Both  the  Court's  characterization  of  the  issue  and \nits  are \nTitle VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C. \nprovides: \n\"No  person  in  the  United  States  shall, \non  the  ground  of  race ,  color,  or  national \norigin,  be  excluded  from \nin,  be  denied  the  benefits  of ,  or  be  sub-\nj ected  to  discrim1nation  under  any \nprogram  or  activity  receiving  Federal \nfinancial  assistance.\" \nSince  CHA' s  public  housing  system  was  a  program  \"receiving \nFederal  financial  assistance ,\"  and  in  that  program  CHA \ndiscriminated  against  the  plaintiffs  on  the  basis  of  race,  there \ncan  be  no  doubt  that  Section  2000d  was  violated.  There  is  no \ndispute  that HUD ,  knowing  of  the  discrimination,  nonetheless \ncontinued  to  approve  CHA's  racially  discriminatory  activities \n-16-\n\n\\ \nand  fund  its program.  In  nearly  identical  factual  circum-\nstances  a  complaint  against  HUD  was  sustained  in  Hicks  v. \nWeaver,  302  F.Supp.  619  La.  1969);  appeal  dismissed, \nDecember  17,  1969 ,  on  motion  of  HUD.  In  Hicks  the  court \nsaid: \n\"Likewise ,  through  its Secretary  Weaver, \nHUD  has  violated  the  plaintiffs'  rights \nunder  42  U.S .C.  2000d.  As  noted  above, \nHUD was  not  only  aware  of  the  situation \nin Bogalusa  but  it effectively  directed \nand  controlled  each  and  every  step  in \nthe  program.  Nothing .could  be  done \nwithout  its  approval .  HUD  thus  sanctioned \nt he  violation  of  plaintiffs'  rights  and \nwas  an  active  participant  since  it could \nhave  halted  the  discrimination  at  any  step \ni n  the  program.  Consequently ,  its  own \ndiscriminatory  conduct  in  respect \nis  vi olative  of  42  U.S.C.  ยง2000d.\"  302 \nF.Supp.  at  623  (emphasis  supplied). \nHicks  is  indistinguisr{able  in  priยทnciple  from  this  case. \nA  recent  decision  of  the  Third  Circuit Court  of Appeals \nconfirms  the  view  that HUD's  approval  and  funding  of  CHA's \ndiscriminatory  program  violated  Section  .  In  Shannon  v. \nHUD,  F . 2d  {3rd  Cir.  1970) ,  HUD  had  approved  a  rent \nsupplement  program  of  a  local  publi c  agency,  the  Philadelphis \nRedevelopment  Authority ,  to  be  utilized  in  a  so-called  \"22l(d) (3)\" \nmortgage  insurance  project.  The  Court  said  that,  from  a \nsocial  standpoint ,  the  project was  the  funct ional  equivalent \nof  public  housing: \n\"IF] rom  a  social  standpoi nt  a  221 (d) ( 3) \nproject with. 100  percent  rent  supplement \noccupancy  is  the  functional  equivalent  of \na  low  rent  public  housing  project.\"  Slip \nopinion  p . l7 . \n-17-\n\nThe  Court  also  said  that  no  site  selection  distinctions \nbetween  low  rent  public  housing  and  22l(d) (3)  rent  supplement \nhousing  had  been  developed,  and  that  the  latter program \n\"would  seem  to  have  the  same  potential  for  perpetuating \n.....  racial  segregation  as  the  low  rent  public  housing  program \nhas  had.  See  Gautreaux  v.  Chicago  Housing  Authority,  296 \nF.Supp.  907  (N.D.  Ill.  1969);  Hicks  v.  vveaver,  supra .\"  Slip \nopinion  p.l8. \nIn  Shannon,  as  here,  it was  alleged  that  the  local \nagency  selected  and .HUD  approved  housing  sites which  \"will \nhave  the  effect of  increasing  the  already  high  concentration \n..... \nof  low  income  black  residents  [in  the  areas  chosen].\"  Slip \nopinion  p.2.  There,  as  in  Count  II  here ,  jurisdiction was \nJ \nlaid under  28  U.S.C.A.  ยงยง1331  and  1343.  Ibid.  There,  as \nhere,  HUD's  site  selection  approval  and  funding  were  claimed \nto  violate Title VI  of  the  1964  Civil  Rights  Act,  42  U.S.C.A. \nยง2000d.  Id,  at  p ,lO. \nThe  Court  of  Appeals  so  held,  and  said  that  under  the \nCivil  Rights  Act  of  1964  t he  Secretary  of  HUD  was  di rected  \"t o \nlook  at  the  effect s  of  local pl anning  action  and  to prevent \ndiscriminat ion  i n  housing  r esulting  from  such  action. \"  I d . \nat p . l l.  I t  added: \n\"Possibl y  before  1964  the  admi nistrators \nof. the  federal  housing  programs  coul d,  by \nconcentrating  on  land  use  contr ol s,  building \ncode  enforcement,  and  physical  conditions \nof  buildings,  remain  blind  to  the  very  real \neffect  that  racial  concentration  has  had  in \n-18-\n\n\\ \nthe  development  of  urban  blight.  Today \nsuch  color  blindness  is  impermissible. \nIncrease  or maintenance  of  r acial \nconcentration  is  prima  facie  likely  to \nlead  to  urban  blight  and  is  thus  prima \nfacie  at  variance  with  the  national  housing \npolJ_cy.\"  Slip  opinion  p. 2 0. \nIn  Shannon  HUD  approved  the  program  of  the  Philadelphia \nRedevelopment  Authority  without  considering  the  factor  of \n..... \nracial  concentration.  Slip  opinion  pp.  18,20.  Here ,  knowing \n. the  racial  concentration  effects  of  past  and  proposed  CHA \nprograms,  HUD  deliberately  approved  and  funded  a  program which \nnot  only  increased  racial  but  continued  and \nexpanded  a  housing  system which  was  de  jure  segregated.  If \nmere  failure  to  consider  racial  concentration  in  approving \nlocal  agency  site  selection  violates  ยง2000d,  as  Shannon  holds , \nthere  can  be  no  doubt  that HUD  conduc.t  here  does  so. \nThe  District Court's  contrary  conclusion  in  this  case  was \nthat,  \"The  court  bel ieves  that plaintiffs have  misconceived \nthe  remedial  claim  which  should  be  taken  and  Count  II  of  the \namended  complaint  is  dismissed  for  failure  to  state  a  clai m  for \nwhich  r elief  can  be  granted.\"  (A-49.)  The  reason  for  this \nconclusion  is  somewhat  unclear;  apparently  it is  based  on  the \nabsence  of  an  agency  r elationship  between  CHA  and  HUD.  CHA \nwas  not  HUD's  agent,  the  Di strict  Court said,  and  its  acts  were \nnot  HUD ' s  acts .  \"Funding  and  approval  [by  HUD]  have  not  so \nreached  into  the  operations  of  CHA  as  to  make  its  f unctions \nfederal  governmental  functions.\"  (A-48.)  The  Court also  noted \n-19-\nโข \n\n\\ \nthat CHA  and  HUD  are  \"separate  governmental  entities.''  (Ibid.) \nThe  District Court's  conclusion  is  contrary  to  Shannon \nand  Hicks.  It is  also  contrary  to  the  obvious  intent of \nwhich  no  doubt  intended  Title VI  of  the  Civil  Rights \n-\nAct  to  apply  to  federally  financed  or  assisted  programs \nadministered  by  or  through  state  and  local  governmental \nbodies.  For  example,  Senator  Humphrey's  answer  to  a  question \nabout  Titl e  VI  showed  clearly  that  the  title was  intended  to \n..... \napply  where  discrimination was  carried  on  by  a  State or other \nlocal  political  subdivision: \n\"Some  Senators  have  expressed  the  fear  t hat \nin  its original  form  title VI  would  authorize \ncutting  off  of  all  Federal  funds  going  to  a \nState  for  a  particular program  even  though  onl y \none  part of  the  State were  guilty  of  racial \ndiscrimination  in  that  program.  And  some \nSenators  have  the  title would \nauthorize  canceling  all Federal  assistance  to \na  State  if it were  discriminating  in  any  of \nthe  federally  assisted programs  in  that State. \n\"  ITJ hese  i nterpret ations  of  titl e  VI \nare  inaccurate  ...  IA]ny  termination of \nFederal  assistance  will be  restricted  to  the \n-\nparticular  political  subdivision which  is \nviolating  non-discrimination  regul ations \nestabl ished  under  title VI.\"  (Congressional \n- Record,  June  4,  19 6 4,  pp .  12 28 8-89,  [emphasis \nadded] . ) \nThe  courts  have  so  held.  See ,  e.g. ,  Bossier  Parish  School \nBoard  v.  Lemon,  37a  F.2d  847  (5th  Cir. ,  1967). \nAnother  aspect  of  the  District Court's  focus  on  the \nasserted  absence  of  an  agency  r elationship  between  HUD  and \nCHA  is  its  discussion  of  Burton  v.  Wilmington  Parking  Authority, \n-\n-20-\n\n\\ \n365  u.s.  715  (1961).  In  Burton  a  state  agency  leasing  space \nto  a  private party was  held  jointly  responsible  with  the \nprivate  lessee  for  racial discrimination  because  the  agency's \n-\nrelationship  to  the  lessee  made  the  agency  a  \"joint \nparticipant\"  in  the  discrimination.  The  District Court  here \nsought  to  distinguish  Burton  on  the  ground  that  two  sovereignties \n-\nare  involved  in  this  case whereas  in Burton  the  par ties  were \na  state  agency  and  a  private  lessee.  (A-48.) \nCount  II  does  not  allege  a  respondeat  superior  theory  of \nliability.*  Rather,  it asserts  that BUD's  own  conduct  constitutes \n*Even  i f  there  were  some  requirement  that ยทthe  discriminatory \nconduct  of  CHA  be  somehow  attributable  to  HUD,  whether  on  a \n\"joint participation''  theory  or  otherwise ,  the  District \nCourt's  attempt  to  distinguish  thi s  case  from  Burton  for \nthe  two  sovereignties  reason  would  be  inappropriate.  On \nconstitutional  grounds  Simkins  v .  Moses  Cone  Memorial  Hospital, \n323 F.2d  959  (4th  Cir.  1963)  heTd  the  \"separate  but  equal\" \n1 \nprovisions  of  the  Hill-Burton  Act  violative  of  both  the  Fifth \nand  Fourteenth  Amendment.  The  fact  that  federal  assistance \nwas  administered  in  some  r espects  through  state  agencies \nprovided  no  ground  for  avoiding  the  prohibitions  of  the  Fifth \nAmendment.  The  Court  said  that  the  \"language  and  holding  [of \nBurton]  i s  not  to  be  limi t ed  to  cases  involving  l eases  of \npubli c  property.\"  323  F.2d  at  968-69 . \nNor  would  it be  particularly novel,  as  the  District Court \napparently  thought,  to  attr ibute  the  acts  of .a  local  agency  to \na  federal  agency.  In  Schetter  v.  Housing  Authority  of  the  City \nof  Erie ,  132  F.Supp.  149  (W.D.  Pa.  1955)  the  court  held  that \n1 \nthe  United  States  could  be  liabl e  under  the  Federal  Tort \nClaims  Act  for  the  negligence  of  the  Erie  Housing  Authority \nbecause  of  the  extensive  control  of  the  Public  Housing \nAdministration  over  Erie.  The  court  said: \n\"I  am  compelled  to  find  that Erie  was  an \ninstrumentality  of  the  United  States , \nanยทd  that  the  United  States  is  a  proper \ndefendant  to  the  instant proceedings.\" \n132  F.Supp.  at  152. \n-21-\n\na  violation  of  ยง2000d.  That  section  is /' viol ated,  as  Hicks \nI \nv.  Weaver  held,  when  HUD  knowingly  parti cipat es ,  t hrough \n\\ \nsupervision  and  funding,  in  a  discriminatory  program.  HUD \nis  not  to  be  held  liable  for  CHA's  discriminat ion,  as  a \nprincipal  may  be  held  liable  for  the  acts  of  his  agent,  by \na  mere  showing  of  the  relationship  and  without  any \nparticipation  in  the  agent's  acts.  HUD  is  liable  for  its \n- own  act s  of  knowing  supervision  and  funding  of  a  di scrimina-\ntory  program.  Thus,  the  District  Cour t ' s  statement ,  \"Funding \nand  approval  have  not  so  reached  into  the  operations  of \nCHA  as  to  make  its  functions  feder al  government  functions\" \n(A-48),  misses  t he  point.  HUD's  funding ,  and  HUD 's  approval \nof  CHA's  discriminatory  program,  with knowl edge  t hat  t he \nprogram  was  di scr i minatory ,  const i t ut e  acts  of  HUD  which \nviolate  ยง2000d. \nIn  Green  v .  Kennedy ,  309  F.Supp 1127  (D.C.D.C.  1970),  a \nprelimi nary  i njunction  was  granted  which  bar r ed  t he  Secretary \nof  the  Treasury  and  the  Commissi oner  of  Internal  Revenue  from \ngranting  t ax  exempt  status  to  privat e  schools  in  Mississippi \nunl ess  they  first  determined  that  the  schools  were  not \nracially  segregated.  The  complai nt  alleged  that  the  t ax \nbenefits  violated  ยง2000d.  By  contrast  wi th  the  view  of  the \nDistri ct  Court  in  this  case  concerning  \"agency\" ,  the  Green. \ndefendants  conceded  that  tax  benef i t s  should  be  deni ed  if  \"state \naction\"  wer e  i nvolved  i n  t he  oper ati on  of  segregated  schools. \n-22-\nc \n\nThe  only  issue was  whether  tax  exemption  could  constitutionally \nI \nbe  extended  to  segregated  private  schools  not  otherwise \nI \n- unconstitutional  because  of  state  involvement.  The  Court, \nholding  that  it could  not  be,  said: \n\"The  inadequacy,  from  a  constitutional  point \nof  view,  with  the  statute  as  applied  by \nthe  Internal  Revenue  Service ,  lies  in  the \nassumption  by  the  Service  that  the  ultimate \nconstitutional  issue  is  whether  constitutional \nguarantees  have  been  violated  because  the \nestablishment  and  maintenance  of  segregated \nprivate  schools  has  been  aided  by  state \ninvolvement  and  support,  independent  of  any \nsupport  from  federal  tax  benefits  ... \" \n309  F.Supp.  at  1137. \nHow  ironic  that  the  issue which  the  Service  conceded  is  the  one \nthat  stopped  the  District Court  here.  Clearly ,  as  the  Service \nconceded,  if ยง2000d  is  violated  by  aiding  private  discrimination, \n(the  holding  of  Green  v.  Kennedyf,  a  fortiori  it is  violated \nby  aiding  state,  (e.g. ,  CHA),  discrimination.  And  if such \nindirect  aid  as  granting  a  tax  benefit  constitutes  i mpermissible \ninvolvement  in  a  discriminatory  arrangement,  the  extensive  and \ndetailed  involvement  of  HUD  in  CHA's  operations  \"qual ifies\" \nas  impermissible. \n*  *  * \nThe  facts  showing  HUD's  involvement  in  the  illegal \ndiscrimination  of  a  local  housing  authority  are  at  l east  as \ncompelling  as  in  Hicks,  supra,  where  HUD  chose  not  to  appeal. \nCongress  unquestionably  intended  the  prohibitions  of  ยง2000d \n-23-\n''-\n\nto  apply  to  discrimination  by  state  and  local  agencies. \nHicks,  Shannon  and  Green,  as  well  as  the  clear  intent of \n- ยง2000d,  all  show  that  the  opinion below  erred  in  its \ndiscussion  of  ยง2000d,  and  that  HUD's  conduct  in  this  case \nwas  a  violation of  that Section .  The  of  Count  II \nof  the  compl aint  was  therefore  erroneous. \nIII. \nTHE  ACTION  IS  NOT  BARRED  BY \nTHE  DOCTRINE  OF  SOVEREIGN \nIMMUNITY. \nLastly ,  the  District Court  said  that  the  action was \nbarred  by  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity .  The  Court \n\\ \nquoted  Dugan  v .  Rank,  372  u.s.  609  (1963),  to  the  effect \nthat  a  suit  is  against  the  sovereign  if the  effect of  the \njudgment  would  be  to  r estrain  the  government  from  acting  or \nto  compel  it to  act.  (A-51.)  It stated  that  a  decree  i n \nfavor  of  plaintiffs  here  would  be  \"operative  against the \ndefendant  in  his  offici al  capacity\"  (A- 52),  and  concluded , \n\"This  court  does  not  have  jurisdi ction  to \ndirect  and  control  the  poli cies  of  t he \nUnited  States  and  the  government  must  be \npermitt ed  to  car ry  out  i ts  functions \nunhamper ed  by  judicial  i ntervention. \" \n(A- 52- 53.} \nIt is  of  course  inappropriate  t o  dismi ss  an  action  because \nof  speculation  as  to  the  relief  which  mi ght  be  granted . \nMoreover,  declaratory  as  well  as  injunctive  relief was  sought. \n-24-\n\nu.s. \nSee,Powell v.

But \ni \naccepting  ar guendo  the  trial  court's  statement  that  \"the \nI \n-\nrelief  sought would  not  be  effected by  merely  ordering  the \ncessation  of  conduct\"  (A-52),  the  sovereign  immunity  doctrine \ndoes  not  apply  in  this  case  for  two  separate  reasons ,  both \n- of which  require  reversal: \n\\  . \n(A)  The  government  has  by  statute  consented  to  be \nsued. \n..__ \n(B)  This  case  falls  within  an  acknowledged  exception \nI \nto  the  sovereign  immunity  doctrine. \nr \nA.  The  Government  has  by  Statute  Consent ed  to  be  Sued. \nJurisdiction  over  this  acti on  is  securely  rested  upon \nthe  \"sovereign's\"  consent.  That  i s  found  in  42 \nu. s.c. \nยงl404(a),  which  provides : \n\"The  United  States  Housing  Aut hority. may \nsue  and  be  sued  only  with  r espect  to  i t s \nfunctions  under  this  chapter  [Chapter  8 \n(Low-Rent  Housing) ,  Title  2]  and  sections \n1501=1505  of  this  title . \" \nThis  action  is  based  upon  the  claim  that,  in  the  adminis-\ntrati on  of  the  government 's  low-rent  housing  program,  the \ndefendant  has  excrtised  his  powers  in  a  manner  which  violates \nplaintiffs '  onstitutional  rights .  The  defendant  has \nacknowledged  that  his  act i ons  and  authorit y  are  derived  from \nChapt er  8  of  Title  42.  (Rec.  Item  20 ,  HUD's  Memorandum,  p.2.) \nChapter  8  contains  the  express  Declaration  of  Policy  regarding \nlow-rent  housing  (ยง1401) ,  defines  t erms  such  as  eligibi lity \n-25-\n\n(ยง1402),  establishes  the  United  States  Housing  Authority \n(ยง1403) i  empowers  the  Secretary  of  HUD  to  exercise  the \nfuncti  ns  of  the  Authority  (Id.) ,  and  generally,  throughout \nits  numerous  other  provisions,  sets  out  the  duties  and \nguidelines  for  the  Housing  Authority .  Within  the  provisions \nof  Chapter  8  are  the  powers  of  funding  and  approval  of  sites \nfor  low-rent  public  housing,  and  it is  the  exercise  of  those \npowers  in  particular which  ยฃorm  the  basis  of  this  action. \nSection  1404 (a)  therefore  constitutes  a  consent  to  an  action \nsuch  as  this  and  a  waiver  of  whatever  protective  mantle \nsovereign  immunity  might  have  otherwise  afforded. \nIn  FHA  v .  Burr,  309  U.S .  242 ,  245  (1940),  the  Supreme \nCourt,  referring  to  a  similar  provision  in  the  National \n) \nHousing  Act  of  1934 ,  stated: \nwaivers  by  Congress  of  governmental \ni mmunity  in  case  of  such  federal  instru-\nmentalities  should  be  l iberally  construed . \nThis  policy  is  in  line with  the  current \ndisfavor  of  the  doctrine  of  governmental \nimmunity  from  suit.\" \nIn  Sigona  v.  Slusser,  124  F.Supp.  327 ,  329  (D.Conn.  1954), \nthe  Cour t  cited  Burr  and  acknowl edged  that  \"under  Section  1404 (a) \nof  Title  42  U.

Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment,  284  F.Supp.  809,  834  (E.D .  Pa.  1968) . \nIt is  true  that  some  courts  have  on  occasion  denied  that \nSection  10  of  the  A.P.A.  constitutes  a  waiver  of  immunity  as \nto  those  actions  falling  within  its  scope.*  However, \nalthough  the  Supreme  Court  has  not  specifically  ruled  on  the \nquestion,  it seems  to  have  assumed  in  Rusk  v .  Cart,  369  u.s. \n367  (1962) ,  t hat  Section  10  is  a  grant  of  jurisdiction  and  a \nwaiver  of  immunity.  In  jurisdiction  in  an  action  for \ndeclaratory  and  i njunctive  r elief was  rested  on  Section  lQ. \nThe  Court  said  (369  U.S.  at  379-80)  it would  not  hold  \"that \nthe  broadly  remedial  provisions  of  the  Administrative  Procedure \nAct  are  unavailable  to  review  administrative  decisions  ...  in \nthe  absence  of  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that Congress  so \nintended.\"  Abbott  Laboratories  v.  Gardner,  387  U.S.  136  (1967), \nis  in  accord. \n*See  the  cases  collected  and  analyzed  in  Hearing  before  the \nSubcommittee  on  Administrative  Practice  and  Procedure  of  the \nSenate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary ,  June  3,  1970,  p . 88 \n(hereinafter  cited,  Hearing\") . \n!I \n- 27-\n\nThe  weight  of  authority  and  the  better  reasoned  and  more \nrecent  cases  also  support  Powelton's  reading  of  Section  10. \nIn  Scanwell  Laboratories,  Inc.  v.  Shaffer,  424  F.2d  859,  874, \n(D.C.  Cir.  1970),  the  Court  said: \n\"It seems  axiomatic  to  us  that  one  must \nimply,  from  a  statement  by  the  Congres s \nthat  judicial  r eview  of  agency  acti on  will \nbe  granted,  an  intention  on  the  part of \nCongress  to  waive  the  right  of  sovereign \nimmunity;  any  other  construction  would \nmake  the  review  provisions  illusory .\" \nKletshka  v.  Driver,  411  F. 2d  436,  445  (2d  Cir.  1969),  held  that \nthe  A.P.A.  grants  jurisdiction  to  federal  courts  to  provide \nrelief with  respect  to  alleged  violations  of  law  by  federal \n-\nagencies  and  \"constitutes  a  waiver  of  sovereign ยฑmmunity \nconcerning  those  claims  which  come  within  its  scope.\" \n) \nSimilarly,  in  Estrada  v.  Aherns,  296  F.2d  690,  698  (5th  Cir. \n1961),  brought  solely  under  Section  10,  the  Court  examined \nthe  relationship  between  sovereign  i mmunity  and  the  A.P.A.  and \nsaid: \n\"The  practice  of  bringing  suits  against \nan  individual  off icial  to  r estrain or \nreview  governmental  acti on  reflects  the \nhistorical  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity . \nIn  days  now  l ong  gone  by ,  relief  could \nbe  obtained  only  by  a  showing  that  the \nofficial  sued  had  acted  on  invalid \nauthorization  or  outside  his  authorization \nand  therefore  could  not  be  deemed  to  have \nacted  for  the  government  . ..  See  Larson \nv.  Domestic  & Foreign  Commerce  Corp . , \n1949,  337  U.S.  682 ,  69  S.Ct.  1457,  93 \nL.Ed.  1628;  . \n\" โข..  The  doctrine  is  wearing  thin.  Recent \nyears  have  witnessed  a  great  expansion  of \n-28-\n\nthe  individual's  rights  to  seek  redress \nagainst  the  government  f or  wrongs \ncommitted  by  it.  See  Davis,  Administra-\ntive  Law  Treatise  ยง25.01-.03  (1958) ;  Hart \n& Weschsler,  The  Federal  Courts  and  The \nFederal  Syst em  1161-63  (1952);  Note  68 \nHarv.L.Rev.  506  (1955).  Probably  t he  two \nmost  important  federal  statutes  waiving \ngovernmental  immunity  are  the  Federal \nTort  Claims  Act  of  1946  [28  U.S.C.A. \nยง2674]  and  the  statute  involved  in  this \ncase,  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act, \nยท also  passed  in  1946.  By  providing \njudicial  review  in  an  action  brought \nby  'any  person  adversely  affected  or \naggrieved  by  any  agency  action'  Congress \npermitted  suits  which  under  established \ntests  would  certainly  be  barred  as  suits \nagainst  the  government.  Cf.,  Larson \nsupra,  337  U.S .  at  693-695 .  The  Act \nthereby  makes  a  clear waiver  of  sovereign \nimmunity  in  actions  to  which  it appl ies. \" \n(emphasis  supplied. \nAlso  supporting  this  view  of  Section  10  are  Shannon, \n'-\nsupra; -Citizens  Committee  for  the  Hudson  Valley  v.  Volpe,  425 \nF.2d  97  (2d  Cir.  1970) ;  Coleman  v.  United  States,  363  F.2d \n190  (9th  Cir.  1966) ,  adhered  to  on  rehear ing,  379  F.2d  555 \n(1967);  Cappadora  v.  Celebrezze,  356  F. 2d  1  (2d  Cir.  1966); \nMulry  v.  Driver,  366  F.2d  544  (9th  Cir.  1966);  Brennan  v.  Udall, \n379  F.2d  803  (lOth  Cir.  1967);  and  Adams  v.  Wi tmer ,  271  F.2d \n2 9  ( 9 th C i r .  19 5 8 ) . \nThus  i t  is  clear  on  two  separate  grounds  that  the  \"sovereign\" \nhas  consented  t o  be  sued  in  an  acti on  such  as  this  one  and  that \nt he  doct r i ne  of  sovereign  i mmuni ty  i s  therefore  no  bar  to  the \nsuit. \n- 29-\n\nB.  This  Case  Falls Within  an  Acknowl edged  Exception \nto  the  Sovereign  Immunity  Doctrine . \nIn  addition  to  the  government ' s  consent,  which  is  itself \nfully  dispositive  of  t he  sovereign  immunity  issue,  this \ncase  falls  within  a  well-recognized  exception  to  the  sovereign \nimmunity  doctrine. \nThat  exception  is  t hat  a  private  party  may  secure  judicial \nredress  against  government  officials  for  conduct  in  violation \nof  constitutional  or  statutory  provisions.  As  the  Attorney \nGeneral ' s  Committee  on  Administrative  Procedure  observed: \nthe  Government  enjoys  sovereign \nimmunity  from  suit,  its  officers  do  not \nshare  in  that  immunity.  They  are  answerable \nfor  wrongs  committed  even  in  the  course  of \ntheir official work.\"  Administrative \nProcedure  in  Government Agencies,  S.Doc.  No. \n8,  77thCongr:- ,  lstSess .,  80-82  (1941). \nA  formulation  of  this  exception  to  sovereign  immunity  is  found \nin Larson  v.  Domestic  & Foreign  Commerce  Corp. ,  337  U.S.  682, \n701-02  (1949) : \n..... \n\" ...  the  action  of  an  officer of  the  soverei gn \n...  can  be  regarded  as  so  as  to \npermit  a  suit  for  relief  against  the \nofficer  as  an  indivi dual  only  if it is  not \nwithin  the  officer 's  statutory  powers  or,  if \nwithin  those  powers ,  onl y  if the  powers ,  or \ntheir exercise  in  the  particular  case ,  are-\nconstitutionallv  void . \"  (Emphasis  added.) \nThis  exception  is  so  well-recognized  that  the  Government \n- has  been  criti cized  for  even  arguing  the  contrary .  In  Toilet \nGoods  Ass 'n  v.  Gardner,  360  F.2d  677,  683  n . 6  (2d  Cir.  1966), \naff'd  387  u.s.  158  (1967),  Judge  Friendly  said: \n-30-\n\n\\ \n\"IThe  Government  makes]  the  surprising \ncontention  that  an  action  for  a  declara-\ntion  that  federal  regulatory  officers \nhave  acted  in  excess  of  their  authority \nconstitutes  an  unconsented  suit  against \nthe  United  States.  IL]aw  officers \nof  the  Government  ought  not  to  take  up \nthe  time  of  busy  judges  or  of  opposing \nparties  by  advancing  an  argument  so \nplainly  foreclosed  by  Supreme  Court \ndecisions.\"  ยท \nMoreover,  the  former  Assistant Attorney  General  who  was  assigned \nto  express  the  views  of  the  Department  of  Justice  on  a \nlegislative  proposal  to  modify  the  sovereign  immunity  doctrine \nsaid, \n\"IT]here  is  no  doubt  that  a  court  today \nmay  look  into  unauthorized  or  uncon-\nstitutional  agency  action  ... \"  Letter \nfrom  William P.  Ruckelshaus,  Assistant \nAttorney  General  to  Hon .  Edward \nKennedy,  Hearings,  p . 256-57. \nSince  the  complaint  here  clearly  alleges  that  the \ndefendant  exercised  his  powers  in  a  manner  which  was  \"constitu-\ntionally  void,\"  the  acknowledged  exception  to  the  sovereign \nimmunity  doctrine  is  clearly  applicable.  (Cases  which  explicitly \nutilize  this  exception  against  the  Sโฌcretary  of  HUD  and  other \nfederal  defendants  are  discussed  in  the  next  following  subsection \nof  this  brief.)  For  this  separate  r eason  the  sovereign \nimmunity  doctrine  is  no  bar  to  this  suit. \n- C.  The  District Court 's  Contrary  Vi ew  is  Erroneous . \nThe  District Court  seems  t o  have  been  l ed  astray  because \nof  its  view  that  the  relief  sought  would  require  \"affirmative\" \n-31-\n\n; \naction  (i. e .,  some  sort of mandatory  action)  by  a  federal \nofficial.  Thus,  the  court  said  that  \"the  crit ical  consideration \nI \nis  not  the  identity  of  the  parties  ...  but  rather  t he  result \nof  the  judgment\"  (A-50),  stated  that  it was  without  jurisdiction \nto  compel  the  defendant  Secretary  to  act  in  a  particular \nmanner  \"in discharging  the  myriad  functions  and  programs \nentrusted  to  him  by  Congress ,\"  (A-52),  and  quoted  Dugan .v . \nRank,  372  U.S.  609,  620  (1963)  to  the  effect  that  \"the  general \nrule  is  that  a  suit is  against  the  sovereign  if the  judgment \nsought would  interfere with  the  publi c  admi nistration \nor  if the  effect of  the  judgment would  be  to  restrain  the \n-\nGovernment  from  acting,  or  to  compel  it to  act.\"  (A-51.) \nThe  trial  court's  reliance  on  such  a  \"general  rule\"  was \nmisplaced.  As  Professor  Kenneth  Culp  Davis,  a  leading \nauthority  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity,  states: \n\"This  so-called  general  rule  [of  Dugan]  never \nhas .been  the  general  rule  and  i s  not  likely \nto  become  the  gener al  rule.  Judgments  of ยท \ncourts  have  often  ...  interfered with  the \npublic  administration,  and  have  often \nr estrained  the  government  from  acting  or \ncompelled  it t o  act,  and  j udgments  of  courts \nwill  surely  continue  to  do  those  things  in \nthe  future .\"  Davis,  Administrative  Law \nTreatise ,  ยง27. 01  (1965  Pocket  Part,  at  149) . \nExamples  of  such  \"interference\"  with public  administration  are \nnumerous,  particularly  in  actions  where ,  as  here,  violations \nof  const itutional  rights  are  alleged.  have  been \nupheld  against  the  exercise  of  t he  Secr etary  of  State's  discretion \nin  the  issuance  of  passports,  Kent  v.

In  Vitarelli  v.  Seaton,  359  U.S.  535  (1959), \nthe  Supreme  Court  ordered  the  government  to  reinstate  an \nemployee;  in  Greene  v.  McElroy,  360  U.S.  474  (1959),  to  restor e \na  r evoked  security  clearance;  and  in Schneider  v.

Rank: \n''A  suit  is  not  barred  by  sovereign  immunity \nif  (1)  it alleges  t hat  the  actions  of  the \nofficers  challenged  are  beyond  their \nstatutory  authority ,  or  (2)  it alleges \nthat  although  acting within  the  scope  of \nthat  authority,  the  powers  exercised,  or \nthe  manner  i n  which  they  are  exercised ,  are \nconstitutionally  void.\"  312  F.Supp.  at  1219. \nIn  the.se  and  other  cases  in  which  plaintiffs  have  sought \nequitabl e  relief  against unconstitutional acts  of  federal \n..... \nofficials,  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  i mmuni ty  has  been  no  bar. \nThe  trial  cour t's  assert ion  that'' . ..  the  government \nmust  be  permitted  to  carry  out  its  functions  unhampered  by \njudicial  intervention\"  (A-53)  is  t hus  contrary  t o  the  history \n-34-\n\n\\ \nof  judicial  review of  the  acts  of  government  offici als.* \nThe  only  two  cases  cited by  the  District Court  on  t hi s  poi nt, \nMinnesota  v.

This  is  an  area  in whi ch  speci al \n-\npolicy  reasons  and  the  availability  of  an  alternate  r emedy \nin  the  Court  of  Claims  buttress  the  application  of  the \nsovereign  immunity  doctrine,  although  Knox  Hil l  seems  t o \nundermi ne  the  sovereign  immunity  doctrine  even  in  t his \nlimited  area.  See  Knox  Hill  slip  opinion,  pp .  11-14. \nThe  opinion  below  referred  to  this  quotation  from \nLouisiana v.

Thi s  attacks  a  straw man  created  by \nt he  cour t  i t self.  Plaint iffs  have  not  sought  a  \"free  license\" \nfor  court,  nor  has  the  court  been  asked  to  \"control  the \npolicies  of  the  United  Stat es\"  as  the  court' s  opinion  implies. \n(A-53.)  It is  unpersuasi ve  to  suggest that  an  equitable  remedy \nimpl ementing  the  policies  of  42  U.S .C.  ยง2000d  and  fashioned \ni n  a  responsible  manner  by  a  federal  court would  be  a  \"free \nl i cense\"  over  issues  not  before  the  court  or would  encompass \n\"control\"  of  the  policies  of  the  United  States.  Viewing  this \nnotion  from  a  somewhat  different perspective,  Professor  Davis \nhas  asked: \n\"Can  a  decree  which  carries  out  the \nsovereign ' s  established  constitutional \nlaw,  statutory  l aw  or  common  l aw  ever \noperate  against  the  sovereign's \nparamount  interest in preferring  a \nrule  of  law  of  force?  ...

Was  it not  \"affirmative\"  action where  the  effect of \nthe  court  order  in Aptheker  v .  Secretary  of  State,  378  U.S.  500 \n(1964)  was  t o  require  the  Secretary  of  State  t o  issue  a  passport? \n-36-\n\nWas  the  Secretary  of  I-IUD  being  \"restrained\"  or  was  he  being \n\"compelled''  by  the  order  in Powelton,  supra,  to  the  effect \nthat  the  Secretary  could  disburse  no  further  funds  for  a \nparticular project  until  the  Secretary  had  afforded  certain \nprocedural  opportunities  to  plaintiffs?  Was  the  Coast \nGuard  Commandant  \"compelled\"  or  \"restrained\"  by  the  decision \n-\nin Schneider  v .  Smith,  390  U.S.  17  (lg68),  directi ng  the \nCommandant  to  approve  a  license?  Such  metaphysical  ques t i ons \ncan  be  asked  in  nearly  every  case  involving  equitable  relief. \nIt would  be  a  strange  rul e  that was  based  on  the  outcome  of \nsuch  semantic  enigmas, \nSimilar  conceptual mysteries  occasionally  appear  in  the \ncases  under  the  l abel  of  11interference\"  with  governmental \nfunctions.  Courts  are  under standably  r eluctant  to  impose  their \n- judgments  upon  administrati ve  agencies  and  federal  offici als \nand  therefore  occasionally  state  that  they  decl ine  to  \"i nterfere\" \nwith  governmental  functions .  Thus,  the  trial cour t  sai d ,  \"the \ngovernment must  be  permitted  to  carry  out  its  functions \n-\nunhampered  by  judicial  intervention .\"  (A-53.) \nIn  numerous  instances,  from  reapporti onment  t o  school \nsegregation,  courts  have  imposed  t heir  judgments  upon  government al \n-\nagencies .  The  question  i s  not  whether  jurisdiction  lies  but \nwhat  form  of  relief  may  be  appropriate .  In  Powell v .  McCormack, \n395  U.S.  486  (1969),  involving  the  expulsion  of  a  member  of \nt he  House  of  Representatives,  respondents  argued  that  the  federal \n...... \n-37-\n\n\\ \ncourts  were  without  jurisdiction.  The  Court  said  (395  U.S . \nat  511) : \n'',.,  there  is  a  significant  difference \n- between  determining  whet her  a  federal \ncourt has  'jurisdiction  of  the  subject \nmatter'  and  determining  whether  a  cause \nover which  a  court  has  subject matter \njurisdiction  is  'justiciable . '\" \nAfter  finding  federal  jurisdiction based  on  Section  1331  (the \ncase  \"ar,ising  under  the  Constitution,\"  395  u.s.  at  511-13) , \nthe  Court  sai d  that  any  remaining  bar  to  reviewability would \nonly  arise  from  \"the  allocation  of  powers  between  the  two \nbranches  of  the  Federal  Government. \"  395  U.S.  at  513 .  As \nto  that  ,issue  (which  the  Court  characterized  as  \"confrontation\" \nand  which  the  trial  court  here  referred  to  as  \"judicial \nintervention''),  t.he  Court  declared: \n\"Our  system  of  government  requires  t hat \nfederal  courts  on  occasion  interpret  the \nConstitution  in  a  manner  at variance  with \nthe  construction  given  the  document  by \nanother  branch.  The  conflict  t hat \nsuch  an  adjudication  may  cause  cannot \njustify  the  courts '  avoiding  their \nconstitutional  responsibility .\"  395 \n-\nU.S.  at  532. \nIn  Hobson  v.  Hansen,  269  F.Supp.  401,  517  (D.C .  1967), \n-\nthe  court  said: \n\"It  is  regrettable,  of  course,  that  in \ndeciding  this  case  this  court must  act  in \nan  area  so  alien  to  its  expertise.  It \nwould  be  far  better  indeed  for  these  great \nsocial  and  political  problems  to  be  resolvedโข \ninยท the  political  arena  by  other  branches \nof  government.  But  these  are  social  and \npolitical  problems  whi ch  seem  at  times  to \n-38-\n\ndefy  such  resol ution.  I n  such  situations , \nunder  our  system,  the  judiciary must  bear \na  hand  and  accept  its  responsibility  to \nassist in  the  solution where  constitutional \nrights  hang  in  the  balance.  So  it was  in \nBrown  v .  Board  of  Education,  Bolling  v . \nSharpe ,  and  Baker  v.  Carr.  So  it is  in \nt he  South where  federal  courts  are  making \nbrave  att empts  to  implement  the  mandate  of \nBrown.  So  i t  is  here . \"  (Emphasis  added.) \nIn  Shannon  the  project had  been  built  and  occupied  by \nt he  time  of  t he  decision.  Nonet hel ess  the  Court  said: \n- \"The  compl etion  of  the  project  and  the  creation \nof  intervening  rights  of  third parties  does \ni ndeed  present  a  serious  problem  of  equitable \nr emedies .  It does  not,  however,  make  the  case \nmoot  in  the  Article  III  sense .  Relief  can \nbe  given  i n  some  form.  For  example,  the \ncourt  could  order  that  the  project mortgage \nnot  be  guaranteed  under  ยง22l(d) (3)  and  that \ni t  be  sold  to  a  private  profit-making  owner. \nI t  could  order  that  the  project  continue  in \nnon- profit ownership  as  a  ยง22l(d) (3)  project, \nbut  that  t he  rent  supplement  tenants  be \ngradually  phased  out  and  replaced  with  market \nr ental  tenants.\"  Slip  opinion  pp.  23-24. \nUl timate  of  the  appropriate  remedy  was  left  to  the \nt rial  court. \nIt thus  appears  t hat  t he  trial  court may  have  confused \nthe  question  of  jurisdiction with  the  problem  of  fashioning \nan  appropriate  remedy  if plaintiffs  prevail  on  the  merits. \nThe  eventual  issue  of  remedy  in  this  case  may  not  be  free  from \ndifficulty,  but  that  issu  cannot  be  resolved  by  denying \njurisdiction. \n.-39-\n\n*  *  * \nThe  foregoing  discussion  shows  that  this  case  falls \nwithin  a  well-recognized  exception  to  the  sover eign \nimmunity  doctrine,  quite  apart  from  the  sovereign ' s  consent \n-\nto  jurisdiction.  But  a  few  lines  about  the  doctrine  itself \nmay  be  appropriate. \nThis  case  illustrates  the  pitfalls  involved  in  that \n- tangled  doctrine.  Typical  is  the  question  whether  a  suit \nis  or  is  not  brought  against  the  \"sovereign.\"  Thus  the \n-\ntrial court  here  felt  compelled  to  insist that  the  desired \nrelief made  the  suit one  against  defendant  in his  \"official \ncapac;i.ty\"  (as  d;i.stinct  from  his  \"personal\"  capacity,  however \nthose  terms  may  be  defined).  But  when  could  a  suit  against \na  federal  official,  seeking  relief  from  the  unconstitutional \nexercise  of  that  official ' s  powers,  not  be  an  action  brought \nagainst him  in  his  \"otficial  capacity\"? \nAs  Professor  Louis  Jaffe  has  observed  in  his  Sovereign \nImmunity,  77  Harv.L.Rev.  l,  35  (1963): \n''. . .  as  long  ago  as  Osborn  [Osborn  v.  The \nBank  of  the  United  States,  22  U.S.  73s;-\n6  L.Ed.  204  (1824)]  Marshall  taught  that \nthere  were  many  suits  for  which  consent \nwas  unnecessary  though  the  Government  or \nthe  states  was  deeply  interested.  Reference \nto  'reality'  assumes  a  narrowly  logical \nconcept  of  what  is  ' really'  a  suit  against \nthe  United  States  which  such  Justices  such \nas  Marshall ,  Bradley,  Miller  and  Frankfurter \nhave  never  accepted  as  established  either \nby  customary  law  or by  the  requirements  of \npolicy .  Surely  there  is  no  obvious  canon \n-40-\n\nof  common  sense  whi ch  tel ls  us  t hat  to \norder  an  off icer  to  perf orm his  st atutory \nduty  to  patent  land  ei ther  i s  or  is  not \na  suit against  the  Uni t ed  St ates .  It \nwould ,  no  doubt,  be  taken  under  our \n- l ingui stic usage  as  a  suit agai nst  the \nGover nment .  But  the  Government  is  not \nthe  Uni t ed  States.  I ndeed,  i t  has  been \nfound  i mpossibl e  t o  establish  a  strict \nlinguistic  form  which  '.vould  tell  us  when \na  su1t  against  an  officer  1s  really  a \nsuit  against the  Unit ed  States . \"  (emphasis \n-\nadded.) \nSovereign  i mmunity  i s  judge-made  doct rine .  There  is  no \nprovision  in  the  Constitution  establ ishing  it.  There  is  no \nAct  of  Congress  requiring  it.  The  Supreme  Court  has  said, \n\" ITJhe  immunity  enjoyed  by  t he  United \nStates  as  a  territorial  sovereign  is  a \nlegal  doctr ine  which  has  not  been  favored \nby  t he  test of  time.  It has  increasingly \nbeen  found  to  be  in  confl ict with  the \ngrowing  subjection  of  governmental  action \nt o  t he  moral  judgment.\"  National  City  Bank \nv .  Republi c  of  China,  348  U.S.  356 ,  359 \n(1955). \nTo  say  t he  least,  t he  courts  have  not  been  consistent \n- in  appl ying  the  doct rine .  \"As  a  mat ter  of  l ogic ,  i t  is  not \neasy  to  r econci l e  all of  Iour  cases  on  sovereign  immunity] \" \nLand  v .  Dollar,  330  U.S.  731 ,  738  (1947) . \nResponsible  commentators  uniformly  characterize  sovereign \nimmunity  as  a  doctrine  of  little value which  is  erratically \napplied  and  constitutes  a  trap  for  t1e  unwary.  (See  e.g.,  the \nstatements  of Messrs.  Jerre  S.  Williams,  Ashley  Sellers,  Roger \nc.  Cramton,  Dan  M.  Byrd,  Jr.,  and  Kenneth  Culp  Davis  and  the \nAppendi ces  i n  Hearings ,  pp.  6,  13,  45,  55,  61  and  76 ;  3  Davies , \n-41-\n\nAdministrative  Law  Treatise,  ch.  27  (1958) ;  and  Jaffe \nSovereign  Immunity,  77  Harv.L.Rev.  1  (1963) .) \nProfessor  Davis'  summary  i s  apt: \n\"The  strongest  support  for  sovereign \nimmunity  is  provided  by  that  four-horse \nteam  so  often  encountered  - historical \n..... \naccident,  habit,  a  natural  tendency  to \nfavor  the  famil iar ,  and  inertia.  Nothing \nelse  supports  sovereign  immunity ,  despite \n-\nthe  many  recitations  in  judicial opinions \nthat  a  court  cannot  'stop  the  government \nin  its  tracks'  or  interfere  in public \nadministration.\"  Davis,  Sovereign  Irruuuni ty \n..... \n11ust  Go,  Hearings ,  p.202 . \n..... \n*  *  * \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons  the  doctrine  of  sovereign \ni mmunity  has  no  application  to  this  action.

With  respect  to  residence  the  City  of  Chicago  is, \nand  continuously  since  1950  has  been,  highly  segregated  along \nracial  lines.  At  the  t ime  of  the  filing  of  this  Complaint, \nNegroes  numbering  approximately  1,000,000  persons  constituted \nover  25%  of  the  total  population  of  Chicago.  At  such  time \nover  85%  of  all  Negroes  l iving  in  Chicago  resided  in  neighbor-\nhoods  the  racial  composition  of  which  was  all  Negro  or  sub-\nstantially all  Negro  (hereinafter  \"Negro  neighborhoods\").\" \nDuri.ng  the  entire  period  from  1950  to  the  present,  over. 75% \nof  all  Negroes  living  in  Chicago  resided  in  Negro  neighborhoods. \nSuch  Negro  nei ghborhoods  wer e  and  are  predominantly  l arge \nand  contiguous ,  and  not  small  and  s cattered,  arrJ  t hey  con-\nstitute  compact,  segr egat ed  areas  of  Negro  residence  t he \nbulk  of  which  i s  l<nOivn  as  the  Negr o  Ghetto. \n- 9-\n\n'. \n,I \nยท 10.  Such  large  scale  residential  segre8ation  of \nNegroes  within  the  Negro  Ghetto  in  Chicago  hasยท  had  and  will \ncontinue  to  have  highly  detrimental  effects  upon  Negrcยทes \nliving  therein including  the  following: \n1 \n. (a)  Physical  isolation  from  and  lack  of  social  contact \nwith  the  larger  predominantly  white  community \nwithin which  the  Negr0  Ghetto  is  located  generate, \n---\n---... \namong  Negro  residents  thereof,  feelings  of \n' \ninfer  ority  as  to  their status  in  the  community \nt hat  affect.  their  hearts  and  minds  in  a  way \nunlikely  ever  to  be  undone.  The  separation  of \nt he  races  is  usually  interpreted  as  denoting \n--\nt he  inferiority of  the  Negro  group,  and  the \nsense  of  inferiority  thus  imparted  to  residents \nof  the  Negro  Ghetto  detrimentally  affects  their \nmotivation  and  their ability  to  become  useful \nmembers  of  the  society  at  large,  and  has  a \ntendency  to  retard  their  educational ,  social  and \npolitical  development.  Such  feelings  of \ninferiority and  other  detrimental  effects \nhcive  been  and  are  produced  by  the  Negro  Ghetto \nin  Chicago . \n-:-10-\n\n.. \n...  r \n(b )  isolation  from and  lack  of  soci al \ncontact  with  the  larger  predominantly white \ncommunity  which  the  Negro  Ghetto  is \nl ocated  results,  and  has  resulted  in  Chicago, \nin a  pervasive  life  pattern  of  pathology \nmarked  by  ignorance,  fear,  racial  misunderstanding, \nbroken  homes,  illegitimacy,  delinquency,  drug \naddicti-on; <hatred  and  violence,  all  of i'>'hich \n',\"' \ncrippl es  and  great  numbers  of  persons \nliv  na  within  the  Negro  Ghetto. \n(c )  Segregation  in  education  invariably occurs  where \nNegroes  are  residentially  segregated  and  such \neducational  segregation  has  occurred  in  Chicago \nand  has  followed  the  geographic  pattern  of  the \nresidential  segregation  hereinabove  referred  to. \nAt  the  t ime  of  the  f ilin  of  this  Complaint \napproximately  90%  of  the  Negroes  attending \nelementary  schools  and  approximately  70%  of \nthe  Negroes  attending  high  sc11ools  in  Chicago \nattended  segregated  N9gro  schools  --i.e. , \nschools  which  were  all  or  substantially \nall  Negro .

ROMNEY,  Secretary  of \nthe  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development, \nDefendant-Appellee. \nON  APPEAL  FROM  THE  UNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT \n_ \n_./  FOR  THE  NORTHERN  DI.S'rRICT  OF  ILLINOIS \nBRIEF  FOR  THE  APPELLEE \nSTATEMENT  OF  ISSUES  PRESENTED \n1.  Whether  an  action  alleging  that  HUD  has  assisted \nracially  discrimi natory  practices  of  a  local  housing  authority \nis  moot  because  the  practices  challenged  have  been  enjoined. \n2.  Whether,  because  its  consistent,  affirmative  efforts \nto  end  the  discrimination alleged  failed  in  some  respects,  HUD \nvi olated  any  rights  of  Negro  housing  project  tenants  and \napplicants  under  the  Fi.fth Amen_dment  or  the  1964  Civil  Rights \nAct. \n\nSTATEMENT  OF  THE  CASE \n1.  Nature  of  the  Case \nThis  action against  the  Secretary  of  the  Department  of \nHousing  and  Urban  Development  (HUD)  has  been  brought  by  Negro \ntenants  in and  applicants  for  public  housing  projects  in Chicago, \nIllinois  (App.  6).  On  behalf  of  themselves  and  all other Negroes \nsimilarly  situated  (App.  6),  plaintiffs  seek a  declaration  that \nthe  Secretary  has  \"assisted  in  the  carrying  on  and  * * * continues \nto  assist  in  the  carrying  on,  of  a  racially discriminatory  public \nhousing  system within  the  City  of  Chic.ago,  Illinois\"  (App.  28). \nPlaintiffs  also  sought  to  enjoin  the  Secretary  11from  making  avail \nable  to  the  [Chicago  Housing]  Authority  any  Federal  financial \nassistance -to  be  used  in  connection with  or  in  support  of  the \nracially discriminatory  aspects  of  the  [Chicago]  public  housing \nsystem\"  or  \"any  sites which  have  been  selected  in a  rac:\\ally \ndiscriminatory  manner  or  which  will  have  the  effect  of  continuing \nand  strengthening  ex.ยท sting  patterns  of  Negro  residential and \nschool  segregation\"  in Chicago  (App.  19-20).  In  the  district \ncourt,  however,  plaintiffs  conceded  the  inappropriateness  of \nan  injunction  barring  further  funding  (App.  36). \nThe  district court  dismissed  all four  counts  of  the  complaint. \nCount  I  alleged  a  violation  of  the  Fifth Amendment.  The  court \nheld,  however,  that  11the  Fifth Amendment  in  the  circumstances \nhere  alleged\"  did  not  authorize  the  suit  (App.  43).  The  dis \nu.s.c. \nmissal  of  Count  II,  which  alleged  violation  42  2000(d), \nwas  based  upon  the  court's  finding  that HOD's  financial  assistance \n- 2  -\n\ndid  not  make  it a  joint  participant  in  the  discriminatory \npractices  of  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority  (CHA)  and  the  Chicago \nCity  Council.  Counts  III and  IV  were  dismissed  because  they \nfailed  to  allege  CHA's  conduct  had  been  deliberately discrimina \ntory.  Plaintiffs appeal  from  this  order  and  attack primarily \nthe  dismissal  of  Counts  I  and  II  of  the  complaint.  (See, \nApt.  Br .โข ,  p.  fo). \n2.  Statement  of  Facts \nA.  Discriminatory  Practices  of  CHA  and \nand  the  Chicago  City  Council \nIn  the  companion  case  of  Gautreaux  v.  Chicago  Housins \nAuthority,  265  F.  Supp.  582  (N.D.  Il l ., 1967),  296  F.  Supp.  907 \nand  304  F.  Supp.  736  (N.D.  ~11 . ,  1969)J  436  F.  2d  306  (C.A.  7, \n. 1970)  (affirming  unreported  order  of  July  20,  1970),  certiorari \n' denied,  39  U.S.L.W.  3451  (April  19,  1971),  the  district court \nยทfound  that  CHA  imposed  racial quotas  limiting  the  number  of \n,Negro  tenants  in four  housing  projects  located  in  predominantly \nwhite  areas  of  Chicago. 296  F.  Supp.  at  909.  Until  1968,  these \nfour  projects were  listed  on  CHA  tenant  selection forms  as \nappropriate  for whites  only. \nThe  court  found  that  CHA  employed  an  informal  pre-clearance \nprocedure  which  ''resul t[td)  in  the  veto  of  substantial  numbers  or \nsites  on  racial grounds\"  296  F.  Supp.  at  913.  Under  Illinois \nlaw,  the  Chicago  City  Council  has  the  power  to  veto  the \nacquisition  of  any  site  selected  by  CHA.  Ill.  Rev.  Stat., \nCh .  67  1/2, ยง  9.  CHA  followed  the  practice  of  submitting \neach  purposed  family  housing  site  to  the  Chicago  City  Council \n- 3  -\n\n. \n:.' \nalderman  in whose  ward  the  site was  located  for  the  alderman's \napproval  prior  to  submitting  the  site  for  the  City  Council's \napproval.  Between  1955  and  1966,  CHA  initially selected  forty-\none  sites  in white  areas  and  sixty-two  sites  in Negro  areas.  Only \ntwo  of  the  white  sites,  however,  achieved  the  necessary  approval \nby  the  alderman and  the  City  Council  while  forty-nine  Negro \nsites were  approved.  The  court  concluded  (296  F.  Supp.  at  912): \nNo  criterion,  other  than  race,  can \nplausibly  explain  the  veto  of  over  99 \n1/~ \nof  the  housing  units  located  on  the  White \nsites which  were  initially selected  on  the \nbasis  of  CHA's  expert  judgment  and  at  the \nsame  time  the  rejection  of  only  10%  or  so \nof  the  units  on  Negro  sites. \nThe  result,  as  found  by  the  district  court,  was  that \n\"given  the  trend  of  Negro  population movement,  99  1/2%  of  CHA \nfamily  units  [other  than  the  four  projects  in which  racial \nquotas  were  imposed]  are  located  in areas  which  are  or  soon \nwill  be  substantially all Negro.\"  296  F.  Supp.  at  910.  Of \nthe  tenants  in CHA's  family  housing  projects,  ninety  percent \nare  Negro  and  if  the  four  projects with  racial quotas  are \nthis  figure  rises  t o  ninety-nine  percent.  In  addition, \n~eluded, \nninety  percent  of  the  13,000  people  on  the  waiting  list for \nfarp.ily  projects  are  Negro.  The  number  of  white  families  eligible \nfor  public  housing  (188,000),  however,  is  more  than  twice  as \ngreat  as  the  number  of  eligible  Negro  famil ies  (76, 000). \nPublic  housing  for  the  elderly,  as  opposed  to  the  family \nprojects,  is  not  confined  to  predominantly  Negro  areas.  Of \nthe  5,050  units  operated  by  CHA,  54  1/2 percent are  located \n- 4  -\n\nin white  areas.  At  one  time,  CHA's  tenant  selection for  these  pro \njects  was  based  upon  a  \"proximity  applicants  who \nrule,\"_!.~., \nresided  close  to  the  projects were  granted  a  priority over  the  other \nThe  proximity  rule  was  abandoned  after the  Commissioner \n~pplicants. \nof  the  Public  Housing Administration  informed  CHA  in  1963  that  its \ncontinued  use  would  result  in a  loss  of  federal  funds. \nTo  remedy  the  discriminatory  site  selection and  tenant \nselection  practices  it found,  the  district court  entered  an  injunc \ntion requiring  specified  affirmative  action  by  CHA.  304  F.  Supp. \n736.  CHA  was  ordered  to  build  its next  700  units  and,  thereafter, \nseventy-five  percent  of  its new  construction  in areas  of  Cook \nCounty  located  at  least  one  mile  from  areas  having  a  Negro \npopula~ \ntion  of  thirty percent  or  more.  Concentration  of  public  housing \nunits  was  limited  by  three  requirements.  First,  no  project  can  be \ndesigned  for  occupancy  by  more  than  120  persons  where  possible,  and \nin  no  event  for  more  than  240  persons.  the  percentage  of \nSecond ~ \nCHA  public  housing  units  cannot  exceed  fifteen  percent  of  all \ndwelling  units  in  the  same  census  tract.  Third,  units  for  families \nwith  children and  at  least  eighty  percent  of  non-family  units \nleased  by  CHA  cannot  be  above  the  third  story.  CHA  was  also \ndirected  to  develop  a  new  tenant  assignment  plan  to  include  certain \nprovisions  specified  by  the  court.  Further,  CHA  was  ordered  to \nsubmit  detailed  reports  to  the  Department  of  Justice  and  to HUD's \nregional  office  describing  every  project  it approved  in  the  future. \nIn  addition,  CHA  was  ordered  to  \"affirmatively administer \n- 5 -\n\n* * * \nits public  hOU:3ing  system  in  every  respect  to  the  end \n* * \nof  disestablishing  the  segregated  public  housing  system  * \" \nโข \n304  F.  Supp.  at  741.  To  that  end,  CHA  was  ordered  to  use  its \n..!1 \nbest  efforts  to  increase  the  supply  of  public  housing  units. \nThe  pre-clearance  procedure  and  all  other forms  of  invidious \nracial  discrimination were  enjoined.  Finally,  the  order  stated \nthat  upon  actual  notice,  its  terms  would  be  binding  upon  the \nChicago  City Council  members  and  all  other  persons  \"in active \nconcert  or  participation\"with CHA.  304 F.  Supp.  at 741. \nB.  HOD's  Actions \nIn  the  district  court,  plaintiffs admitted  that HUD \n* * * \nhas  made  \"numerous  and  consistent  efforts  to  persuade \nthe  Chicago  Housing  Authority  to  locate  low-rent  housing \nprojects  in white  neighborhoods\"  (App.  44).  The  court found \nHUD  has  \"made  efforts  to  correct  the  activity  complained  of, \nsucceeded  in some  respects,  but  continued  f unding knowing  oi' -\nthe  possible  action  the  City  Council  would  take\"  (App.  48). \nSome  of  the  affirmative  actions  regarding  this  problem \ntaken  by  HUD  in administering  not  only  the  family  public \nhousing  program  but  many  of  its other  programs  as  well,  are \ndocumented  by  the  uncontradicted  affidavits  filed  in  the \n1/  This  portion  of  the  order was  modified  on  July  20,  1970, \nto require  CHA  to  submit  to  the  City  Council sites  for  1500 \nunits.  See  436  F.  2d  at  311. \n- 6  -\n\ndistrict  court.  The  former  Assistant  Regional  Administrator \nfor  Housing  Assi stance  stated: \nNumerous  and  consistent  efforts  have \nbeen  made  since  1950,  first  by  the  Public \nHousing  Administration and  then  by  HUD  to \npersuade  the  Chi cag0 Housing  Authority  to \nlocate  low  rent  housing  projects  in white \nneighborhoods.  I  personally  recollect a \nmeeting  in  the  early  1950's which  I  attend \ned  with  the  then  Mayor  of  Martin \nChicago~ \nKennelly,  and  others  where  we  attemped  to \nenlist  the  Mayor's  assistance  in  having \nproject  sites  located  in white \nneighbor~ \nhoods.  [Affidavit  of  William E.  Bergeron, \ndated  December  31,  1969]. \nIn  1963,  the  Public  Housing  Administration's  threatened  with \ndrawal  of  federal  funds  led  CHA  to  abandon  the  \"proximity \nrule\"  in selecting  elderly  tenants  for  public  housing.  296 \nF.  Supp.  at 912.  The  PHA  had  determined  that  use  of  this  rule \nviolated  the  anยทt-1-discrimination  policies  of  Executive  Order \nNo.  11063,  3  C.F.R.  652  (1959-1963  Comp.). \nThe  nondiscrimination  provisions  imposed  first  by  PHA \nand  then  by  HUD  have  grown  progressively  more  stringent  since \n1950  in all its  programs  including,  among  others, urban  renewal, \nmodel  cities,  and  FHA-acquired  homes  programs,  as  well  as  low-\ntncome  housing  (see  Exhibit  H).  HUD's  Low-Rent  Housing \nPreconstruction Handbook  establishes  the  criteria for  site \nselection  by  the  local  authorities  (part  of  Exhibit  H).  These \ncriteria  include  the  suitability  of  the  site  in relation  to \nthe  surrounding  neighborhood  and  the  city plan,  the  physical \ncharacteristics  of  the  site,  the  use  of  scattered  sites as \nopposed  to  a  single  site,  the  acquisition cost,  the  feasibility \n- 7 -\n\nof  relocating all site  occupants  to  standard  housing  which  is \nwithin  their financial means,  reasonably  convenient,  and  avail \nable  on  a  nondiscriminatory  basis,  and  the  suitabi li ty  of  the \nsite  from  the  standpoint  of  the  1964  Civil Rights  Act.  In \ndefining  this  last  criterion,  the  Handbook  provides  (at  p.  8): \nThe  housing  on  the  site  to  be  selected \nmust  be  operated  in accordance  with  all \napplicable  of  Ti t le  VI  of  the \n~equirementf \nCivil Rights  Act  of  1964  and  of Executive \nOrder  11063,  and  Department  regulations  and \nrequirements  issued  pursuant  thereto.  The \naim  of  a  Local Authority  in carrying  out \nita responsibility  for  site  selection should \nbe  to  select from  among  sites which  are \nacceptable  under  the  other  criteria  of  this \nSection  those  which  will afford  the  greatest \nopportunity for  inclusion  of  eligible appli \ncants  of  all groups  regardless  of  race,  color, \ncreed,  or  national  origin,  thereby  affording \nmembers  of  minority  groups  an  opportunity  to \nlocate  outside  of  areas  of  concentration  of \ntheir  own  minority  group.  Any  proposal  to \nlocate  housing  only  in areas  of  racial  con \ncentration will  be  prima  facie  unacceptable \nand  will  be  returned  to  the  Local  Authority \nfor  further  consideration and  submission  of \neither  (1)  alternative  or additional  sites \nin other areas  so  as  to  provide  more  balanced \ndistribution  of  the  proposed  housing  or  (2) \na  clear  showing,  factual  substantiated,  that \nno  acceptable  sites are  available  outside  the \nareas  of  racial concentrat :ton. \nIn  1966  PHA  officials  determined  to  reject f 1ve  of  the \nsites  selected  by  CHA  which  were  among  those  specifically \nchallenged  in  this  suit  (see  App.  14-15).  The  reasons  for \nthis  rejection were  that  the  sites were  in areas  of  high \nNegro  concentration and,  in  some  cases,  i n  areas  also  havi ng \na  high  concentration  of  public  housing  (Deposition  of  Joseph \nBurstein  taken  March  25,  1968,  p.  105).

Among  these  actions  are \nthe  granting  of  a  program  reservation  to  CHA  for  3,000 units  and \nto  the  Cook  County  Housing  Authority for  2,000  units.  HUD \napproved  $20,000  in modernization funds  for  CHA.  One  site \nselection study  has  been  :rโขece:tved  by  HUD,  and  HUD  is attempting \nto  involve  the  Illinois  state  officials  in  joint efforts  in \napproaching  the  problem  of  low  and  moderate  income  housing  on  a \nmetropolitan  basis.  In addition,  HUD  provides  funds  to an \norganization assisting Negroes  in  obtaining housing  outside  the \nareas  of Negro  concentration.  Its  investigation  of  complaints \nagainst  a  number  of  real  estate  brokers  led  to  a  favorable  court \ny \nThis  Memorandum  is reproduced  as  an  Addendum  to  this  brief. \n- 9 -\n\ndecree.  HUD's  Equal  Opportunity  Office  is  investigating complaints \nof  dl scrimination  in  the  sale  or  rental  of  housing  in Chicago and \nits suburbs  and  secured  an  affirmative  action  program  from  a  public \nhousing  developer.  HUD's  leasing  program has  produced  racial ly \nbalanced  units  in  two  Chicago  suburbs  with  additional  units  under \ncontract.  The  objectives  which HUD  ~s affirmatively  pursuing \nare  imp:covl ng  the  living environment  of  existing housing  projects, \nproviding  more  low-rent  housing  in  the  areas  specified  by  the \ndistrict court,  and  increasing  the  supply  of  low  and  moderate \nincome  housing  in  the  Chicago  suburbs  of  Don  Morrow, \n(Affir.;,av~\\.t \ndated  June  8,  1970).  To  meet  these  objectives,  HUD  is  engaged \nin formal  and  informal  acti vities  with  local  housing authorities, \na  research  corporation,  a  planning  and  various  levels \ncommissio~ \nof  state and  community  governments. \nARGUMENT \nI \nTHIS  ACTION  :;:._,  MโขJCfl~  .BECAUSE  PL.>'\\:.'Gl'~i.FF.S \nNOW  CONCEDE  THAT  TERMINATION  OF  FEDERAL \nASSISTANCE  TO  CHA  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  IN \nAPPROPRIATE  AND  THE  DISCRIMINATORY \nPRACTICES  THEY  ALLEGE  HAVE  BEEN  ENJOINED. \nMost  of  the  facts  alleged  in the  complaint  (paragraphs  6-19) \npertain only  to  CHA's  conduct,  and  they  are  alleged  in  support \nof  plaintiffs'  request  for  a  declaration  that  CHA  -- not  HUD  --\n\"has  been  and  is  carrying  on  a  racially discriminatory  public \nhousing  system within  the  City  of  Chicago\"  (App.  19,  21-22,  23,  25). \nThis  declaration  together with  all  \"other and  further  relief'''  that \nthe  district  court  deemed  \"just and  equitable\"  has  already  been \n- 10  -\n\n]/ \nsecured  in  the  companion  case.  The  only  alleged wrongdoing  on \nHUD's  part was  to  provide  federal  financial  assistance  to  CHA, \nbut  plaintiffs  have  now  conceded  that  it would  have  been \nf or HUD  to  have  terminated  such  funding.  As  the \ninapp~ยทopriatc \ndistrict  court  intimated  in  the  companion  suit  11even a  temporary \nclenJ.al  of  federal  funds  would  * * *  damage  the  very  persons  this \nsuit was  brought  to  protect.โขโข  296  F.  Supp.  at  915. \nIn  light  of  these  facts,  this  case  is  now  moot.  A fur ther \nindication  that  the  parties  no  longer  possess  a  concrete \nadverseness  (see  Note,Mootness  on  Appeal  in  the  Supreme  Court, \n83  Harv.  L.  Rev.  1672,  1677  (1970)),  is  that HUD  \"strongly \nsupports  the  objectives  of  the  Court  in11  the  companion  case. \n__ /  Memorandum  for  the  Unites  States  at  p.  2.  Although  this \nmemorandum  suggested  some  to  the  order  plaintiff s \nalter~ations \nproposed,  there  certainly has  been  no  charge  that HUD  is \nimpeding  the  effectuation  of  the  relief  ordered.

Public \nHousi~ \nAdministration,  214  F.  2d  222  (C.A.D.c.,  1954).  In any  eve~, \ntenants  and  applicants  within  one  jurisdiction would  have  no \nclaim for  relief from  some  other  jurisdiction. \n- 11  -\n\nactions  in  support  of  the  district court's  objectives.  Memorandum, \nsupra,  at  17-19.  Finally,  plaintiffs  admitted  in  the  court  below \n* * * \nthat HUD  had  made  \"numerous  and  consistent  efforts  to  persuade \nthe  Chicago  Housing  Authority  to  locate  low-rent  housing  projects \nin white  neighborhoods\"  (App.  44).  Indeed,  in  this  Court  plaintiffs \nhave  not  pointed  to  even  one  specific  act  by  HUD  with  which  they \ndisagree,  nor  have  they  hinted  at any action  they  seek as  a  remedy \nfor  what  plaintiffs,  the  amici,  and  HUD  all recognize  as  a  critical \nand  urgent  national  problem:  the  concentration  of  public  housing \nprojects  in  the  predominantly  Negro  areas  of  the  central  city. \nII \nTHE  DISTRICT  COURT  CORRECTLY  HELD  THAT \nPLAINTIFFS  HAVE  FAILED  TO  STATE  A CAUSE \n--\nOF  ACTION  BECAUSE  HUD  DID  NOT  PARTICIPATE \nIN  THE  DISCRIMINATORY  PRACTICES  ALLEGED \nBUT  RATHER  HAS  MAlE  CONSISTENT  EFFORTS' TO \nEND  THEM. \nPlaintiffs argue,  in  essence,  that  because  HUD's  efforts \n4/ \nto  end  CHA's  discrimination- proved  unsuccessful  at  least  in \nsome  respects,  HUD  itself violated  plaintiffs'  rights  under  the \nPlaintiffs  categorization  of  the  Chicago  public  housing \n~ \nsystem as  \"de  lure  racially  segregated\"  (Apt.  Br.,  p.  2)  is \ncorrect  only-w  th  respect  to  the  racial quotas  formerly  imposed  on \ntenant  selection at  four  projects.  Any  resulting \nsegre~ation \nfrom  the  site  selection policies was  de  facto  (see,  Note,  83 \nHarv.  L.  Rev.  1441,  1443  (1970)),  in that  no  one  was  by  law \nexcluded  from  these  projects  because  of  his  race.  As  to  the \nracial  quotas  -- an  issue  now  plainly moot  -- it should  be  noted \nthat  they  represented  an  improvement  over  the  total  exclusion  of \nNegroes  in effect  until  1968.  Moreover,  there  has  been  no  showing \nthat  plaintiffs  challenged  these  former  tenant  selection  policies \nu.s.c. \nthrough  the  administrative  procedure  established  in 42  2000 \nd-1  and  d-2.  This  Congressionally  prescribed  procedure  must  be \nfollowed  prior  to  seeking  Judicial  review.  Green  Street Assn.  v. \nDaley,  373  F.  2d  1  (CoA.  7),  certiorari denied,  387  u.s.  932  (1967). \n- 12 -\n\nFifth Amendment  and  the  1964 Civi1  Hights  Act(Apt.  Br.,  p.  9) . \nHUD  wronged  plaintiffs,  it is asserted,  by  continuing  \"administra \ntively  and  financially,  to  approve  and  participate  in  the  carrying \non  and  expansion  of  the  segregated  Chicago  public  housing  system.\" \n(Apt.  Br.,  p.  9).  Inasmuch  as  plaintiffs  conceded  HUD  should  not \nhave  terminated  its financial  assistance  to  CHA,  the  exact  conduct \non  HUD's  part  which  plaintiffs  feel wronged  them  has  not  been \nspecified.  In  fact,  plaintiffs do  not  suggest  to  this  Court  any \nspecific  instance  in which  HUD  acted  or  failed  to act  in a  manner \nfuey  would  not  have  acted  had  they  been  administering  the  housing \nprogram.  Nor,  for  that  matter,  have  plaintiffs  suggested  to  this \nCourt  ac1ything  which  HUD  should  be  ordered  t o  do  to  remedy  the \nalleged  unspecified  wrong.  These  factors  distingu!:Jh  Hicks  v. \n~._/ \nยทweaver,  302  F.  Supp.  619  (E.D.  La..,  1969),  where  the  action had \nbeen  brought  to  prevent  construction  of  specified  projects  at \nspecified  sites,  thereby  challenging  specific  action  by  HUD \nrelating  to  those  projects.  We  also  note  that  the  order  entered \nagainst  HUD  in Hicks  was  a  preliminary  injunction  barring further \nfederal  funding,  a  type  of  relief which  plaintiffs here  no  longer \nseek. \nThe  district  court  correctly  held  that  plaintiffs'  allegations \ndo  not  state  a  cause  of  action.  The  legal  theory which  arguably \napplies  to lflJD's  conduct  is  the  \"joint  participation\"  doctrine \nu.s. \nof  Burton  v.  Wilmington Parking Authority,  365  715  (1961). \nAfter a  detailed  analysis  of  the  facts  in that  case,  the  Supreme \nCourt  held  that  the  state agency  had  \"so  far  insinuated  itself \ninto a  position  of  interdependence  with  [the  private  restaurant) \n- 13  -\n\nthat  it must  be  recognized  as  a  joint  participant  in  the \nchallenged  activity  * * *.\"  365  u.s.  at 725.  The  court  below \ncorrectly distinguished  Burton  as  not  involving  relationships \nbetween  \"separate and  distinct  political entities  and  sovereignties\" \n(App.  48).  In addition,  the  issue  in Burton was  not  whether  the \ngovernmental  agency  should  be  enjoined;  rather  the  question  was \nwhether  there  had  been  sufficient  state action for  the  discrimination \nto  fall within  the  scope  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Finally, \nin Burton  the  state agency  collected  rents  f rom  the  restaurant  so \nthat  \"profits  earned  by  discrimination  not  only  contribut(1[d]  to, \nbut  also  [were]  indispensable  elements  in,  the  financial  success \nof  a  governmental  agency.\"  365  U.S.  at 724.  In  the  federal \nassistance  program  challenged  here,  this  important  element  is,  of \ncourse,  plainly  lacking. \nAn  extension  of  the  Burton  doctrine  to  programs  of  federal \nassistance  accompanied  by  federal standardswould,  as  the  court \nbelow  noted  (App.  48),  have  consequences  both  far-reaching  and \nundesirable.  In an analogous  case  involving  the  interstate \nhighway  program  in which  the  federal  government  provides  ninety \npercent  of  the  funds  and  sets  construction  standards,  the  Court \nof  Claims  held  that  the  federal  government  was  not  liable  to a \ncontractor for  the  actions  of  the  state.  D.  R.  Smalley  and  Sons, \nInc.  v.  United  States,  372  F.  2d  505  (ct.  Cl.) ,  certiorari denied, \nu.s. \n389  835  (1967). \nApplication  of  a  joint  participation  theory  in  this  case  would \n- 14  -\n\nalso  conflict with  the  statutory  policy  confining  the  role  of \nfederal  authorities  in  the  national  housing  program.  Section  1 \nu.s.c. \nof  the  National Housing  Act  of  1937,  42  1401,  provides: \n\"It is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  vest  in the  local \npublic  housing  agencies  the  maximum  amount  of  responsibility  in \nthe  administration  of  the  low-rent  housing  program** *.11  In \nan  urban  renewal  case,  Harrison-Halsted  Community  Group',   Inc.  v. \nHousing  and  Home  Finance  Agency,  310 F.  2d  99,  104  (C.A.  7,  1962), \nu.s. \ncertiorari denied,  373  914  (1963),this  Court  recognized  the \nsame  statutory  policy: \nThe  federal  Housing  Act  of  1949  is  a  subsidy \nstatute which  provides  for  federal  grants  of  aid \nto  local governmental  units.  Both  Senate  and \nHouse  Committee  reports  stated  \"*  *  *  that  every \nproject assisted  be  a  local  undertaking, .locally \nplanned,  locally approved,  locally managed  and \ndesigned  to  serve  local  needs.\"  (Senate  Report \nNo.  84,  8lst Cong.,  1st Sese.,  p.  37.) \nIn  accordance  with  this  statutory  policy: \nBy  law,  by  contract  and  by  administrative \ncustom  of  almost  thirty years'  standing,  the \nselection of  sites  for  low-rent  housing  pro \njects  is  vested  in  local housing  authorities, \nnot  in HUD.  The  Department  of  Housing  and \nUrban  Development  is  confined  by  said  law, \ncontract  and  administrative  custom  to  approval \nor disapproval  of  the  sites which  the  local \nhousing  authority  selects  and  presents  to HUD. \n2/ \n[Affidavit  of  Marie  C.  McGtllre,  dated \nNovember  9,  1966.] \nThe  strong  objections  to  having  officials from Washington  attempt \nto  redesign metropolitan  areas  throughout  the  nation  reinforce  the \nstatutory and  administrative  policy  that  the  initiative and \n.2/  Acting  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary for Housing  Assisยทtance . \n- 15  -\n\nresponsibility for  selecting  public  housing  sites  rest with  local \nauthorities. \nJames  v.  Valtierra,  39  U.S.L.W.  4488  (April  26,  1971), \nfeafflrms  the  right  of  individual  localities  to  control  their \npublic  housing  program.  In  that  case,  the  Supreme  Court  upheld \nthe  constitutionality  of  California's  requirement  that all pro \na \nposed  low-rent  public  housing  projects  be  approved  by  majority \nvote  in a  community  election.  The  referendum  provision had  been \ncI hallenged  by  citizens eligible for  such  housing  who  argued  that \nI \nthe  refereQdum  constituted  an  invidious  discrimination based  on \nrace  and  poverty,  and  the  three-judge  district  court  had  so  held. \nValtierra  v. โข  Housing  Authority  of  the  City  of  San  Jose,  313 \nF.  Supp.  1  (N.D.  Cal.,  1970),  reversed  sub.  ~ยท James  v. \nyaltierra.  39  U.S.L.W.  4488  (April  26,  1971). \nIn  light  of  the  statutory framework,  HUD  faced  the  dilemma \nof  accepting  sites  proposed  by  CHA  which  HUD  believed  to  be \nlawful  but  not  optimal,  or  rejecting  those  sites and  depriving \npotential  public  housing  tenants  of  improved  shelter.  The \nindividual  plaintiffs  submitted  affidavits  in  the  companion  case \nexplaining why  they  accepted  public  housing  in Negro  projects  _ \nlocated  in Negro  areas.  Dorothy  Gautreaux  stated  her  need  for \nimproved  housing  was  \"desperate\"  when  she  filed  her application \nwith  CHA.  Her  family  of  six was  then  occupying  one  bedroom \n(Affidavit  of  Dorothy  Gautreaux,  dated  December  12,  1966).  Odell \nJones,  his wife,  and  three  children  \"were  trying  to  live  in  two \nrooms,\"  and  \"the  rats  had  begun  to  run  over  the  house  at will\" \n- 16  -\n\nwhen  he  applied  for  public  housing.  (Affidavit  of  Odell  Jones, \nDecember  1966).  When  Doreatha  R.  Crenchaw  applied  to \n~ated \nCHA,  she  and  her  three  children were  living  in  one  and  a  half \nrooms  where  11the  children were  forced  to  sleep  in  the  kitchen, \nwe  shared  a  bathroom with  six  other families,  and  our  place  was \ninfested with  rats and  roaches. 11  (Affidavit  of  Doreatha  R.  Crenchaw, \ndated  December  8,  1966).  That  the  13,000  persons  on  CHA's  family \nI \nhousing  waiting  list  (see  296  F.  Supp.  at 909)  may  well  be  similarly \nsituated  indicates  how  harsh  a  decision  disapproving  proposed \nsites  is.  Nevertheless,  HUD  had  decided  to  reject five  of  the \n1966  proposed  sites  because  they  were  located  in areas  of  high \nNegro  concentration.  Plaintiffs  have  not  expressly argued  to  this \nCourt  that HUD  wronged  them  by  not  disapproving  the  other  proposed \ny \nsites. \nShannon  v.  United  States  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment,  436  F.  2d  809  (c.A.  3,  1970),  involved  HUD's \nsite  selection procedures  for  rent  supplement  housing.  The  Third' \nCircuit held  that  \"within  the  framework  of  the  national  policy \nu.s.c. \nagainst  discrimination  in federally  assisted  housing,  42 \nu.s.c. \nยง_2000d,  and  in favor  of  fair housing[,]  42  ยง  3601,\" \n6/  Green  v.  Kennedy,  309 F.  Supp.  1127  (D.  D.C.),appeal  dismissed, \nu.s. \n198  956(1970),  relied  upon  by  plaintiffs,  is  readily  distin -\nguishable.  The  issue  there was  whether  or  not  the  federal  govern \nment  could  constitutionally allow  income  tax  deductions  for \ncontributions  to  private  segregated  schools  which  were  operated  as \nan  alternative  to  integrated  public  schools.  Here  the  alternative \nto HUD's  approval  of  public  housing  sites  located  in areas  of \nNegro  concentration was  no  sites at all. \n- 17  -\n\nHUD  may  exercise  \"broad  discretion\"  between  alternative  types  of \nhousing.  436  F.  2d  at  819.  The  court  further  held  (436  F.  2d \nat 822): \nNor  are  we  suggesting  that  desegregation \nof  housing  is  the  only  goal  of  the  national \nhousing  policy.  There  will  be  instances  where \na  pressing  case  may  be  made  for  the  rebuilding \nof  a  racial ghetto.  We  hold  only  that  the \nagency's  judgment  must  be  an  informed  one; \none  which  weighs  the  alternatives and  finds \nthat  the  need  for  physical  rehabilitation  or \nadditional minority  housing  at  the  site  in \nquestion  clearly  outweighs  the  disadvantage \nof  increasing  or  perpetuating  racial con \ncentration. \nThere  is  no  question  in  this  case  that  HUD's  choice  was  an \ninformed  one.  Indeed,  plaintiffs  base  their argument  upon  the \npremise  that HUD  was  fully  informed  (Apt.  Br.,  pp.  1-?).  There  is \n* * * \nno  question  that  HUD  made  \"numerous  and  consistent  efforts \nto  persuade  the  Chicago  Housing  Authority  to  locate  low-rent \nhousing  projects  in white  neighborhoods11  (App.  44).  In  these \ncircumstances,  as  the  district court  correctly  held,  plaintiffs \nhave  failed  to  state a  cause  of  action  under  either  the  Fifth \nAmendment  or  the  1964  Civil Rights  Act. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  appeal  should  be  dismissed \nbecause  the  case  is moot.

Ourยทcomments are addressed to the \nprovisions of Plaintiffs' proposed Order. -for two reasons:  First. \nPlaintiffs' Order is. more comprehensive in scope and raises the \nfull range of issues which.t he Court and the parties have consideredโข   ; \n. and in addition has received more extended consideration by the_ \n.  . \nCourt;second.  we accept the Court's view that a generalized Order \nsuch as that proposed by CHA.  substituting fo_r  specific criteria \n--.._ \nI \n\nโข  - 3  -\nโข \na require~ent for judicial review and approval of all project \n-\nproposals,  will not serve the Court's purpose of removing \nconstraints which have heretofore inhibited both housing \n.....  โข \n. \nproduction and production of housing so located and administered \nas to serve the objectives of the Order.

These \ncomments deal first with factual material that we have been able-\nto gather relating to the probable impact of the Order on provisions \nยทof new or rehabilitated public housing units; on leasing; on urban \nrenewal; and on the model cities program.  The second section \nof the material which follows sets forth certain comments and \nobservations based upon the preceding information.

IMPACT OF PROPOSED ORDER \n..... _  1.  Impact on Provision of New or Rehabilitated Public Housing Units \nFrom September 1958 through December 1967 CHA comp1!_ted . \nconstruction of 11,. 817 family dwelling units.  However,.  of this \nnumber only 1,. 284 units were completed during the last 5 years \nof this period -- an average of 257 units per year.  Since December \n1967,.  only six units have been completed,.  but 1,. 25.9 are now in \n.. \n.  various stages of cons1ruction. \nOn the basis of an application filed by the CHAin January 1967, ยท \nthe HUD regional office is currently considering ,the reservation \nof 4,. 000 family uni.ts  and-1, 000 elderly units. \nThe proposed Order would ยทhere.after require placement of \nat least three quarters of all family public housing units (and all \nof the next 1,. 330 units built) in a  \"General Public Housing Area.\" \n. Out of a total city area of about 200 square miles,  a rough calculation \n., \nindicates that an area of approximately 75 miles is avail~ble for \nthe location of such units.'  The Order further requires th~ยท \nscattering of such units by means of. limitations on the amount of \n--\n\n- 5 \nโข  โข \n. \n' \npublic housing which may .~e placed in any given' census tract \n. and by project size limitations.  Within this _area there will. \nof course.  be further limitations of site costs.  availability and \n..... .  โข \nsuitabilityโข  . ยท \nThe \"Limited Public Housing Area'' includes approxi-\nmately 85 square miles classified non -white.  to which have \nbeen added one mile buffer areas which ยทaggregate approximately \n. 40 square miles.  Under the terms of the Order.  no more than \n...  _'ยท one quarter of the family public housing would be built in this \n; \n- -ยทยท \nยท-. -.... \n'  ~ \nยทยท_ยท ยทยท  area. \nA measure of the change contemplated by the proposed \na. \nOrder may be gained from an analysis of the  050 units (or \n10. 903 units counting repeat requests) in \"white\"  areas submitted \nto the city cotincil by CHA over the past 15 years and disapproved \nby it.  Sixty percent of those units were on sites along the boundary \nareas between the non-white and buffer zones.  Twenty-five \npercent were in areas now classified non-white; and only 7ยท75 \nappear to have been proposed for the \"General\" ยทareas as it is \nnow delineated, \n\n- 6  -\nโข \nโข \n. \nWhile we would support the objective of constructing . \n. \n. housing outside the City of Chicago.  in light of the probable \ndifficulty of obtaining the required cooperation of locยทal governmen~s โข.. \n..... \n.  ยทthat appears unlikely to be a major factor in the immediate future. \n2.  Impact on Leasing Program \nยท~he proposed Order also places the leasing program \nunder a  3 to 1 requirement.  requiring that 75 percent of units \nยทleased be in the \"General\" area. \n:  โข. ยท. . -\n.  .  There is a  city-wide vacancy rate of less than 1 percentโข  \n... .... \nยท:.ยท and virtually no availability of three or more bedroom units.  CHA \nreports that since.1965 it has leased only 180 family units.  of. \nwhich. 44 are stated to be in white areas.  ยท Few,  if any.  are large \nunits. \nCurrently.  CHA has com.mEmced  using the leC~.sing program \nfor a number of purposes in the \"Linrited\" area.  I~ is being used \nto support nonprofit moderate-income housing projects where up \nto 20 .percent of the units in such projects can be leased in order \nto  sponsors in achieving financial feasibility.  to reach \nas~i.st \npoorer families,  or to accommodate larger families.  The T. W. 0.-\n.. \nM~remont Project in WoodlaWI) is an example of such an undertaking. \n.  .  1. \nโข. \n\n.  โขยท  - 7  -\nโข \nโข \n. \nThe leasing program is also an element of certain rehabilitation \n.  . \n_ยท progral'!lsโข. such as programs ยทunder the \"Chic _ago Plan Agreement\" \n:ยท_and in the Department of Urban Renewal's rehabilitation programs \n-\non West Douglas Boulevard and Independence Avenue.  Some \nโข \nleasing has already commenced and it is planned that several \n-'ยท \n_h  undre.d_u  nits be leased under these three programs in the \n- . '- . \"Limited\" areas. \n-3.

COMMENTS \nWe have carefullyยท reviewed the provisions of the plaintiffs' \nproposed order,  and have come to the conclusion that 'the basic \nstr<J.cture and direction of that order are appropriate to accomplish \n. the Court's objectives.  In light of the absence of information \nยท ยท concerning the availability of sites in the \"General\" area, -we are \nยทnot  a position to assure the Court that these provisions are \n~n \nthe best qnes,  or that the order is workable as stat~d.  Mter the \n.  - . \norder has been in effect,  and the results of the site survey discussed  ยทยท \nbelow are available,  it may be necessary to make changes in the \norder.  Accordingly,  we suggest that any order of the Court \nexpressly .recognize that the specific features (!:.:..ยฃยทโข  75-25 percent \nrequirement) are subject t? revision based upon experienceยทa nd \nfurther information. \n\nl  โข  - 13 -\nยท. \nโข  โข \n' \n.1. .  The 75 Percent-25 Percent Requirement \n. \n. \nl_t is presently impossible to evaluate the workability\" \n.. ; \nยท of\"the basic 75 percent-25 percent requirement ยทof the proposed \n-. \nOrder.  It will require the location of many sites in an area \nโข \n. where site availability is still an unknown factor.  To the \nextent that there may be difficulties in obtaining sites and \nยท.getting production in the \"Gen~ral\" area.  the formula would \n..... \nimpose another restriction on a program which is already \nfailing to make available sufficient public housing to the families \n- :- - โข. . _-.ยท .ยท : ... ;_in non-white areas.  or indeed to any of the poor families. in  _ \nยท \n. \n. Chicago.  The necessity for dispersion and a balanced distribu':' \ntion of public housing in the City must somehow be reconciled \n.  ' \nwith the need for accelerated re'sponse to the housing needs of \npersons in the \"non-white\" and b_uffer areas. \nThe 100 percent requirement for 1. 330 units in the \n\"General Public Housing Area\" to balance 1. 330 units now be\"ing \nprovided will intensify the problems above.  It would appear \nยท preferable and more ยทlogical to regard the latter as part of the \npast record on which the Court's opinion was based.  and to confine \nthe Order to one formula uniformly applicable to all future housing ยท. \nproduction. \n\ni \nI  f  14 \nโข  โข \nWs recognize and accept the Court's bel~ef that \nspecifio criteria are essential to an Order.  Any ratio calling \nf~r provisi~n of housing units in \"white\" \"areas equal to or \n.....  greater in number than those in \"non-white\" areas would  โข \nยทยท require  a  striking change in CHA's program.  ยทIt is,  therefore, \nยท ยท particularly rmfortunate that there is little or no information \nas to the prospective availability of usable sites in the \"General \nยทPublic Housing Area\" as delin.eated in the proposed order โข. \n\\ \n. \n. . .- We regret that we are rmable at this point to advise the Court \n.:: . \n::<, ยท. .:  ._:.ยท . \nwheth\"er the particular. . 3 to 1 ratioproposed by the plaintiffs, ยท \n:. .  . or any other ratio,  is in fact appropriate. \n.  2.  The Leasing Program \n. ยท Application of the-proposed Order to leasing may present \n,, \n.. \nsome special problems.  The. primary  present utility of the \n\" \nleasing program in Chicago is in connection with new moderate-\nincome housing projects and rehabilitation programs in non-white \nareas.  If units for leasing are as scarce in other areas as we \nrmderstand them to be,  the proposed Order would make it virtually \nยท impossible to use the leasing program for this purpose.

Such preferences can have \nthe effect of denying admission to public housing t~ some non-whites \n. . : ......- ~ ..ยท โข . . . \nโข  --,..  .ยท  .ยท~ยท who have been waiting for public housing for long periods โข. Tbe \n~ \n. proposal may be subject to misunderstanding and attack by non:-\nwhites denied admission,  and it may be subject to abuse. \nยท' . \nยทTo the extent that-the Court requires that projects be \n. _ .  small,  the location of such proje:cts in white neighborhoods \nmay well achieve the desegregated living _pattern which is sought \nwithout regard to the precise composition 'of the residents of' \n- ยทยท-. . \n. the projects.  Though this is less true of larger projects,  we \nquestion whether such preferences or quotas are sufficiently \nuseful to overcome the disadvantages as well as the complications \n. they would add to _already cuml:ersome tenant assignment procedures โข. \n\n- l6 -\nโข \n. 4.  Other Comments \n-__ ~  -. \n.  . \n-We. a gree that the Court's proposal to limit project \n. \nยท size to occupany by 150-200 persons is preferable to a \nยท  24 -dwelling unit limitation.  ยท This still does not permit judgments โข \n-\non size to be made in relation to neighborhood development, \n. services and facilities,  except to a very limited extent,  but it \nought to :be possible to make provision for exceptions in cases \nwhere somewhat larger projects would not be disadvantageous \nโข. .  in light of the location and facilities available. \n- -~.  .. ... . .  -. _-_ \n-_,.  _,_  -ยท  ยท. ยท.  It appears that some exceptions to the limitation to \n15 percent of the family living units in a  tract will be \ncensu~ \nnecessary if statutory and other requirements are to be met, ยท \nr  ..  .  . \nparticularly in the urban .renewal program.  It  should not be \ndifficult to provide for such exce:ptions where needed. \n.. \nIn our view the following clarifying revisions-might \nimprove the proposed order: \n(1)  To more clearly state the objectives of the Court, \nwe would suggest deleting the second paragraph in the proposed \n'  . \njudgment order,  and substituting therefor the paragraph contained \n.1n Att.achment A to this memorandum. \n\n- 17  ;,.. \nโข  โข \n.. \n(2l ยทIn Paragraph V B,  the ยทrelatio,nship ?etween \nยทยทยทpersons presently on the \"waiting list\" and new registrants \n. is not clear.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS \nHUD has considered possible means of utilizing its \nvarious programs in support of .a CHA program under a Judgment \n;.'. \nยท Order.  There are several supporting actions whichยท we are \nprepared to take. \nWe can promptly make fw1ds  available for a survey to \nlocated available and suitable sites.  We can also fund activities \n. .. \n' . \nto modernize existing public housing .so as to make that housing \n\n,ยทยท \nโข  โข  - 18  -\nlocated in\"the \"Limited\" area as desirable and as well \n,I \nserviced as possible.  Another action this Department can \ntake,  as occasions may arise,  is to encourage and approve \n-\n.. \nโข \nutilization of other HUD programs for improvement of neighbor-\nhoods into which housing projects are introduced pursuant to \n. \na  Court Order. \nIn one specific respect.  HUD is ready and willing to \n. assist the Court directly.  We will be happy to participate \n~.\"  in any e~;rrangement whereby CHA proposals are screened or \n-\n.reviewed by HUD in order that we may furnish technical advice \nยทas to  their conformity to the dictates of the Court.  We believe \n.. \nthat some such procedure could suostantially relieve the Court \nof a technical burden which it would otherwise be forced to \nassume. \nIn conclusion,  we assure the Court that we fully \nsupport the objectives of overcoming segregated and over-\nconcentrated patterns of low-rent public housing in Chicago.  We \n\nโข  . - 19 \n. \n. \nยท. ยท.hope 'that they can be achieved together with the ยทproduction \n. o~ a substan~ial volume of sorely needed housing.

Rule  62(c)  permits  a  District \nCourt  to preserve  the  status  quo  ''when  an  appeal  i.s  taken\", \nthe  status  quo  as  i t  existed  at  t he  time  of  the  appeal. \n!ยท~ยท' \nThis  common  sense  reading  of  Rul e  62(c)  was  applied by  the \nCourt  of  Appeals  for  the  2d  Circuit  in  Ideal  Toy  Corporation \nv.  Sayco  Doll Corporat ion  302  F. 2d  623,  625  (2d  Cir.  1962) : \n\"It was  proper,  t o  be  sure,  for  Judge  Bryan \nto  t ake  jurisdiction of  the  motion  pursuant \nto  Rule  62(c),  Fed.  Rules  Civ.  Proc .,  which \npermits  modi fication  of  injunction  orders  during \nthe  pendency  of  an  appeal .  But  t his  rule  i s \ndescribed  as  ' merely  expressive  of  a  power  inherent \nin  t he  oourt  to  preserve  the  status \n~where , \nin  its  sound  discretion,  the  court  deems  t he  cir \ncumstances  t o  justify. 1  [Citations ] \n*  *  *  * \n\"Once  the  appeal  is  t aken,  however,  juri sdict ion \npasses  to  the  appellate  court .  Thereaft er  t he \nappellant  is  not  usual l  entitled  as  of  right \nto present  nev  evidence  or  t o  the  t rial \nargu~ent \ncourt,  \\vhich  i n  the  exercise  of  a  sound  di scretion \nwill  exerci se  only  to preserve  the \njurisdictio~ \nstatus  quo  as  of  t he  t ime  of  appeal ... \" \nIn  the  inst ant  case,  pla i ntiffs  appealed  on  Oct ober  29,  1970, \n-2-\n\nfrom this  Court ' s  orders  of  September  1  and  October  21,  1970, \nand  it  is  the  status  quo  on  the  date  of  appeal  that  is  relevant \nunder  Rule  62(c ).  But  plaintiffs '  motion  does  not  even  address \nitself  to  the  status  quo  as  of  either  the  time  of  appeal  or \nas  of  the  time  of  t he  dismissal  of  their action.  Plaintiffs ' \nmotion  speaks  as  of  September  17,  1971,  more  than  a  year  later. \nThe  subject  matter  of pl ai0tiffs 1  motion  is  a  pool  of \nfunds  under  the  control  of  either  HUD  or  the  City  of  Chicago; \nthis particul ar pool  did  not  even  exi st  in the  fall  of  1970, \nand  could  not ,  therefore,  be  considered  part  of  the  11status \nquo11  as  of  the  time  of  appeal.  If  t he  fact  of  the  avail-\nabil ity of  the  Model  Cities  program  to  t he  City  of  Chicago \nbe  deemed  the  \"status  quo\",  then  it  i s  clear  that  v;hat  plain-\ntiffs  now  seek  for  the  first  time  is  a  substantial  and  far \nI \nreaching  change  in  the  status  quo.  Thus,  the  Court  l acks \n\\. \njurisdiction  to  grant  the  relief  sought  by  plaintiffs '  motion. \nSecond,  Rule  62(c )  is  inapplicable  because  the  relief which \nplaintiffs  now  seek  under  the  Rtl.le  is  compl etel y  different \nfrom the  relief which plaintiffs  seek  in their complaint. \nIf a  plaintiff seeks  an  injunction,  and  is  turned  down,  he \nmay  be  injured  unless  he  obtains  an  order  enjoining  his \noppo~ent \nfrom  certain  cond1..1.ct  during  the  pendency  of  the  appeal;  Rule \n-3-\n\n62(c)  gives  the  court  power  to  grant  such  an  order .  Nothing \nlike  that  has  happened  in  the  present  case.  By  their com \nplaint,  plaintiffs  want  HUD  to  stop  making  available  to  CHA \nfunds  to  assist  the  latter  in  connection  with  housing;  any \norder  this  Court  might  issue  under  Rule  62(c)  should  be \ndirected  toward  the  subject  matter  of  the  litigation,  in \nthis  case,  housing.  But  plaintiffs  now  seek,  under  Rule  62(c), \nto  enjoin  the  payment  of  funds  for  all  sorts  of purposes  to \nthe  City  of  Chicago,  regardless  of  whether  those  funds  are  to \ngo  to  CHA  for  housing purposes  (which  they  are  not).  Plaintiffs \ncould  with  the  same  degree  of  rationality  that  they  demon-\nstrate  with  this  motion  ask  this  Court  f or  an  order  agmnst \nAmtrack  or  the  FAA  to bar  federal  participation  in providing \nmass  transportation  for  the  City  of  Chicago  until  the  City \nCouncil  approves  public  housing  sites  in  a  number  agreeable  to \nplaintiffs .  Such  a  use  of  Rul e  62(c )  is  a  perversion  of  its \npurpose . \nThird,  Rule  62 (c)  only  applies  lvhen  there  has  been  an \norder  \"granting,  dissolving  or  denying  an  injunction\".  The \norders  on  appeal  in  this  case  make  no  reference  to  injunctive \nrelief;  they  dismissed plaintiffs '  action.  Accord \nsi~ply \ni ngly,  the  nature  of  the  order  appealed  from precludes  reliance \n-4-\n\nupon  the  provisions  of  Rule  62(c). \nFourth.  Plaintiffs'  complaint  \\vas  filed  in 1966.  They \nhave  had  many  years  in which  to  seek  to  expand  the  scope  of \ntheir action beyond  housing  to  include  the  Model  Cities \nProgram.  They  did  not  do  so  at  a  time  when  the  Rules  con-\ntemplate  changes  in pleading  and  theory.  They  should  not  be \npermitted  to  do  so  at  this  time  on  any  theory  when  t heir \naction  is  unsupported  by  any  Rule . \nTo  Allow  the  Relief  Sought \nwoul d  Bring  Great  Hardship \nt o  the  Class  that  Plaintiffs \nPurnort  to  Represent \nFor  t he  reasons  discussed  above,  we  submit  that plaintiffs' \nmotion  under  Rule  62(c )  is  technicall~ without  foundation  and \nrepresents  an  attempted  misuse  of  the  rule's provi sions. \nBut  even  i f  the  motion  were  technically  sound,  this  Court  should \nexercise  i ts  di scretion  against  the  motion  because  togrant  it \nwould  cause  great  hardship  to  thousands  of persons,  including \nthe  black  citizens  of  the  City  of  Chicago  who  reside  or  have \napplied  to  reside  in  CHA  fac ilities,  members  of  the  very \ni.~., \nclass  which pl aintiffs  claim to  represent. \nThe  monies  vlhich  plaintiffs  seek  to  tie-up  are  so-called \n\"Model  Cities  Funds, 11  to  be  paid  by  the  federal  government  to \n-5-\n\nthe  City  of  Chi cago  for  the  latter' s  use  i n  providing  social \nservices  and  facilities  to  (among  others)  its poor.  Model \nCities  funds  are  to be  used  for  numerous  purposes,  including \nday  care  centers,  education  and  training  facilities,  and \nimproved  health  and  sanitation.  These  services  are  targeted, \nin  large  part,  for  the  black  citizens  who  reside  in  CHA \nhousing.  To  cut  off  these  funds  would  deprive  these  persons \namong  others  of  essential  services  and  would  certainly \ncause  them  irreparable  harm. \nAs  this  matter  now  stands,  an  indefinite  time  may  pass \nbefore  this  Court  enters  its  final  order  against  HUD.  To  force \nall of  HUD' s  urban  assistance  programs  to  a  standstill to  await \nsuch  a  final  order  would  be  t o  extract  a  drastic  price  from \nthe  black  poor  of  t his  city. \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  CHA  respectfully  requests  that \nthis  Court  deny  the  motion  now under  consideration. \nPatrick  N.

That  the  programs  provided,  pursuant  to  the  Model \nCities Act  provides  in  the  main  for:  social  services \nt o  certain defined  communities  i.e.,  health  centers, \nsummer  programs,  library  facilities,  day  care,  services \nfor  unmarried mothers,  swimming  pools  pre-school  pro \ngrams,  free  breakfast  and  job  training. \n\n8. \nC.  That  the  City  of  Chicago  is  committed,  pursuant \nto  61  contracts,  for  the  expenditure  of  approxi-\nmately  $21,000,000  and  that  said  contracts  were \nlawfully  entered  into  in  reliance  upon  the  assurances \npreviously  given  by  the  Department  of  Housing  and \nUrban  Development. \nD.  That  to  restrain  the  issuance  of  the  funds  would \nprevent  the  City  f rom  paying  its  legal  obligations \nand  would  cause  City  to  suspend  or  terminate \nth~ \ncontracts  pursuant  to which  the  above  services  are \nbeing  performed. \nIV \nThe  injunctive  remedy  sought by  the  Plaintiff does  not  fall \nwithin  the  scope  of  either  Rule  62C  of  the  rules  of  Federal \nCivil  Procedure  or  Rule  8A  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Appellate \nProcedure  in  that  said  remedy  does  not  relate  to  the  issues \nbefore  the  Court  in  this  cause  of  action. \nA.  That  the  Plaintiffs  have  the burden  to  demonstrate \na  likelihood of  success  with  respect  to  the  remedy \nsought  in this matter  - the  providing  of  public \nhousing  is  not  a  part of  the  Model  Cities  Program. \nTeleflex  Industrial  Products,  Inco  v.

That  the Memorandum  has  not \nbeen  formally  adopted by  the \ngoverning  bodies  or  their \nrespective  agencies. \n2.

Preparati on \nfor  trial ,  by  means  of  discovery,  commenced  first  i n  the \n\n-2-\nsuit  against  Chicago  Housing  Authority.  Documents  from  the \nfiles  of  Chicago  Housing  Authori ty and  sworn  testimony  from \nthe  lips  of  present  and  former  Chicago  Housing  Authority \nsupervisory  personnel  revealed overwhelming  and  irrefutable \nevidence  of  twenty  years  of  deliberate housing  segregation  -\nโข.ยท 'โข \non  the  part of  Chicago  Housing  Authority.  That  was  found \n'to be  the  fact  by  this  court  in  its decree  of  July,  1969, \ntwenty-six  months  ago.  After  franti cally consulting  all \nthe  legal  talent  available  to  i t ,  Chicago  Housing  Authority \napparently  determined  that  an  appeal  of  this  decree  would \nยทbโฌ  hopeless  and  abandoned  it.  The  net  effect  of  this was \nto  permit  the ยทdecree  to  stand unchallenged  and  thus  become \nthe  law  of  the  Northern  District of  Illinois. \nAt  this  point  the  court wishes  to  interpolate  a  new \nfacet .  Twenty-one  days  ago,  it was  judicially  determined \nby  the  7th  Circuit Court of  Appeals  that  the  Department  of \nHousing  and Urban  Development was  equally  guilty and  responsi-\nble with  Chicago  Housing  Authority for  deliberately perpetu-\nating  segregated housing.  Relevant  excerpts  from  that \nopinion  follow: \n\"HUD's  approval  and  funding  of  segregated  CHA \nhousing  s ites  cannot  be .excused  as  an  attempted \naccomodati on  of  an  admittedly urgent  need  for \nhousing  with  the  reality of  community and  City \nCouncil  resistance. \n\n-3-\n\"The  fact  t hat  a  governmental  agency  might  have \nmade  'numerous  and  consistent  efforts'  toward \ndesegregation  has  not  yet  been held  to  negate  : \nliability f or  an  otherwise  segregated  result. \n\\ \n\"It  also  is  not  seriously  disputed  on  appeal  that \nthe Secretary exercised  the  above  described  powers \nin  a  manner  which  per petuated  a  racial ly  discrim \ninatory  housi ng  system  in  Chicago,  and  that  the \n.. \nSecretar y  and  other  BUD  off icial s  were  aware  of  ... \n~ \nthat  fact. \n\"On  such  facts,  and  given  the  inappl icability of \nBUD's  'good  faith '  arguments,  we  are  unabl e  t o \navoid  the  conclusion  that  the  Secretary ' s  past \nactions  constituted  racially  discrimi natory \nconduct  in  their  own  right. \n\"We  hold  that BUD,  through  its  Secr etary,  vi olat ed \nthe  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  .  . \nand  also has  violated  Section  601  of  the  Civi l \nRights  Act  of  1964  .โข. \" \nGetting  back  to  the  July,  1969  decree,  the  next  problem \nwas  t he  manner  in which  the  illegal  conduct  that  the  court \nfound  could be  remedied  and  ameliorated .  Chicago  Housing \nAuthorit y  was  or dered  to use  i ts  \"best  efforts\"  to  supply \nand  submi t  as  rapidly  as  possible  to  t he  Ci ty Council  for \napproval  si tes  for  seventeen  hundred  and  for t y-six  unit s  of \npublic  housing.  The  first  seven hundred  of  these  were  to be \nin  the  general  or  white  areas,  and  of  the  balance  of  one \nthousand  and  forty-six,  seven  hundred  and  fifty were  also \nto be  in  the  general  or  white  areas  of  the  City.  The  cour t \n\n-4-\nand  the  plaintiffs waited  patiently  to  determine  what  the \n\"best  efforts\"  of  Chicago  Housing  Authority would  produ\\ce. \nI \nTen  months  later  t hese  \"best  efforts\"  had  not  resulted  ,in \nI \nany  sites being  presented  to  the  City Council  for  approval. \nConferences  were  held  from  t ime  to  time  between \nattorneys  for  the  plaintiff s  and  Chicago  Housing  Authority  ยท.;, \nand  its counsel,  and  at  one  of  these  in  the  spring  of  1970, \nthe  Chairman  of  Chicago  Housing  Authority  advised  the \n-\nplaintiff s  that  they would  su?mit  no  sites  to  the  City Council \nuntil after  the  municipal  elections,  one  year  later  in  the \nspring  of  1971.  The  court was  informed  of  this  statement \nand  also  that  the  \"best  efforts\"  of  Chicago  Housing  Authority \nhad  resulted  in  no  submissions  to  the  City Council.  It thus \nbecame  apparent  that  the  court  could  no  longer  rely on  the \n\"best  efforts11  of  Chicago  Housing  Authority  and  a  new  decree \nwas  signed on  July  1,  197l,which  established  a  timetable  as \nto when  t hese  sites viere  to be  submitted.  This  decree  Chicago \nHousing  Authority  decided  to  appeal,  hoping  that  the  appellate \nprocedure  would  delay  the  performance  of  the  timetable  until \nafter  the  municipal  elections  in  the  spring  of  1971. \nThey went  screaming  and  protesting,  as  they had  a \nlegal  r ight  to  do,  first  to  the  Court  of  Appeals,  and  that \nCourt  sustained  the  July,  1970  decree.  Next,  they went  to \n\n- 5-\nthe  United  St ates  Supreme  Court  seeking  to  reverse  the \nCourt  of  Appeals,  and  the  highest Court in  the  land  denied \nthem  the  relief  sought.  One  final  effort wa--s  made  to  thIe  \nUnited  States  Supreme  Cour t  for  a  rehearing,  seeking  toยท \nhave  that  Court  reverse  itself,  which  was  denied.  Hav1.ng \nrun  the  gamut ,  they  returned  to  the  District Court  where \nprompt .disclosure  and  submission  was  ordered.  Only  then \ndid  Chicago  Housing  Authority,  with  a  gun  to  its head, \ncomply,  twenty  months  after  the  first  decree  and  eight months \nafter  the  second  decree.  Sites  for  seventeen  hundred  odd \nunits were  finally  disgorged  and  submitted  to the  City  Council \nfor  its approval. \nAfter  municipal  elections,  the  City  sought  f rom \nth~ \nthe  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Housing  and Urban  Develop-\nment  26  million  dollars  to  finance  its Model  Citi es  Program \nfor  the  period  from  June  15  to  December  31,  1971.  It is \nobvious  from  the  evidence  that the  Regional  Administrator \nfor  ยทthe  Department  of  Housing  and Urban  Development  was  con-\ncerned  with  the  City' s  failure  to  perform  many  of  its past \ncommitments,  including  prompt  submission  to  the  City Council \nof  the  sites  heretofore  supplied  by  Chicago  Housing  Authority. \nHe  apparently  required  the  City  to  supply  him  with  a  Letter \nof  Intent  as  to  what  its  future  conduct  would be  before \nr \n\nl.  --ยท \n-6-\nauthorizing  and  granting  the  26  million  dollar  request. \nSuch  a  Letter  of  Intent  was  drafted  and  redrafted  and \nresulted  in  the  Letter  of  Intent  of May  12,  1971,  setting \nforth  the  undertakings  of  the  Cit y.  One  of  the  witnesses \nin  the  case,  Lewis  Hill,  the  City's  Commissioner  of  Develop-\n.. \n. \n\"ยท-'\"โข\"  \nent  and  Planning,  testi fied  that  he  participated in  the \ndrafting  and  redrafting  of  this  Letter  of  Intent.  Below \nare  pertinent  excerpts  from  the  Letter ยทof  I ntent: \n\"The  following  is  an  outline  of  the  proposed  action \nprogram  and  a  timetable  for  i ts  accomplishment. \n\"PART  I.  UNDERTAKINGS  BY  THE  CITY  A..l\\l'D  THE  CHA \nfollowing  actions  are  to be  implemented within \n~'The \nthe  times  hereinafter  set  forth. \n\"It is anticipated,  however,  that  sites  suitable \nfor  use  by  Chicago  Housing  Authority  in  accord \nwith  applicable  law  will be  identified and \nprocessed by  the  City  to  permit  acquisition by \nCHA  to  commence  in  accordance  with  the  following \nschedule: \n\"Sites  for  500  units  by  June  15, \n1971~ \nSites  for  350  units  by  September  15,  1971; \nSites  for  850  units by  December  15,  1971.\" \nThis  Letter  of  Intent was  signed by  the  Mayor  of  the  City  of \nChicago,  the  Chairman  of  Chicago  Housing  Authority  and  was \ndispatched  to  the  Regional  Administrator  of  the  Department \nof  Hous ing  and Urban  Development,  who  subsequently  approved  it .. \n\n-\n..... \n. . \n. \n. \n-7-\ni \nIt i s  obvious  f rom  the  evidence  in  this  case  that \n1 \nthe  drafters  and  the  signers  of  the  Letter  of  Intent knew, \ni \nor  \"'hould have  known,  impr obability of  compliance with \nth~: \nt he  undertakings  outli  ed  above.  It is becoming  increasingly \nclear  that  there  was  no  intention by  each  of  the  above  parties \n'.;. \nto comply with  their  undertakings.  The  court  finds  that  t he \nsole  purpose  of  the  letter was  to  induce  the  Department  of \nHousing  and Urban  Development  to  grant  the  26  million  dollars \nfor  funding  the  Model  Cities  Program. \nBy  the  first  deadline ,  June  15,  1971,  only  two  hundred \nforty-two  units  had  been  approved  in  the  general  or  white  areas. \nFrom June  15  to  the  next  date  deadline,  only  forty-six units \nwere  approved  in  the  general  or  white  areas,  leaving  a  deficit \nof  more  than  five  hundred  twenty-five units  for  approval. \nOn  June  21,  1971,  the  Regional  Administrator  of  t he \nDepartment  of  Housing  and Urban  Development  addressed  a  l etter \nto  the  Mayor  containing  the  following  pertinent  excerpts : \n\"As  soon  as  the  City has  completed  approval  of  sites \n' suitable  for  use  by  the  Chicago  Housing  Authorit y  in \naccord with  applicable  l aw'  for  the  500  units  of  l ow \nincome  family  housing  and  has  made  major  progress \nin  the  Leasing  and  Rent  Certificate  Program,  HUD  will \nissue  a  Letter  of  Consent  for  selected  activities \nunder  the  Second  Year  Neighborhood  Development  Program \n(the  total  Year  NDP  being  $20,000,000). \nSeco~d \n\"The  Model  Cities  funds  are  being  r eleased  on  the \ncondition  that  the  City Council will continue  to \n\n-8-\napprove  public  housing  sites  'suitable  for  use  by \nChicago  Housing  Authority  in  accord  with  applicable \nlaw'  at each  regular  Council  session  and  that  the \nother  City Agencies  and  Chicago  Housing  Author\"ty \nwill  continue  to  show  progress  toward  meeting  the \nhousing  goals  set  forth  in  the  Letter  of  Intention. \nShould  this  progress  not  continue  the  Model  Cities \nLetter of  Credit will be  cancelled. ยท\" \nยท. \nIt is  apparent  that  he  planned  release  of  the  Model  Cities \nfunds  was  conditiona l.  It  is  also  perfectl y  clear  that  the \nยทconditions  set  for th have  not been  met,  and  it is becoming \nobvious  that  t hey  never  will be. \nThe  court  agrees  that  failure  to  continue  the  Model \nCities  Program  for  the  next  three  months  would  have  a  devas-\nt ating  effect  on  tens  of  thousands  of  the  citizens  of  this \nCity.  Four  thousand would  lose  thei r  jobs  and  many  other \nthousands  would  be  deprived  of  the  benefits  derived  from  the \nModel  Cities  Program.  Only  the  City of  Chicago,  by  failing \nto  comply with  its undertakings,  and  neither  the  plaintiffs \nnor  this  court,  would  be  responsible  for  such  a  catastrophe. \n'l'he  court wonders,  at  this  stage,  whether  the  Regional \nAdministrator  of  the  Department  of  Housing  and Urban  Develop-\nment,  and  a  former  Mayor  of  t he  City of  St.  Paul,  really \nbelieves  now  that  the  City  intends  to  comply  with  its under-\ntakings.  The  evidence  is to  the  _contrary. \nThere  have  been  occasions  in  the  past,  in  other  parts \nof  this  country,  when  chief  executives  have  stood  at  the \n\n. \n. \n-9-\nschool house  and  the  state house  doors  with  their  faces  livid \n1 \nand  their wattles  flapping,  and have  defied  the  federal  govern-\nment  to  enforce  its  laws  and  decrees.  It is an  anomaly  that \nthe  \"law and  order\"  chief  executive  of  this  City  should \nchallenge  and  defy  the  federal  law.  Apparently,  \"law  and \nยท. \nยทยท.,.t \norder\"  applies  only  to  the  enforcement  of  state  iaw  and \nmunicipal  ordinances. \nThe  defendant  and  the  i ntervenors  have  appealed  to \nthe  court ' s  sense  of  equi ty  in  det ermining  the  matter  before \nit.  The  court  accedes  to  their  request.  The  rourt  will \ngive  the  chief  executive  arid  his  City Council  an  opportunity \nto  r epent  and  reconsi der  their  conduct.  The  court will  sugar-\ncoat  t he  pi l l .  In  order  for  the  City  to  qualify  for  the  26 \nmillion  dollar grant,  the  court will not  require  at  t his  time \nthat  t hey  approve  fourteen  hundred  f ifty units  i n  the  general \nor  white  areas ,  which  t hey undertook  to  supply;  the  court \nwill  require  merely  approval  for  t heir  current  deficit  as \nof  September  15,  1971,  those  seven  hundrยท:?d  such  units,  less \nthan  half of  their  total undertaking.  This  in no  way  relieves \nthe  City of  the  balance  of  its undertaking,  spelled out  in \nthe  l etter  of  May  12.  The  court  i s  handing  them  the  key  to \nt he  funds  that  t hey  so  plaintively  seek ;  however,  unti l  that \nmi nimum  compliance  has  been  achieved,  the  court  i s  enjoi ning \n\n. \n. \n~ \n-10-\nt he  Department  of ยทHou ยทing  and Urban  Development  from  releasing \nany  of  the  funds  but  is  authorizing  it to  do  so when  that \nminimum  requirement  has  been  met . .  Should  the  City fail  to \ndo  soF  the  court has  pinpointed  the  responsibility  for  lhe \ndevastating  effect which  may  ensue.

Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, \n26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499, 505-06. \n1  The original complaint named the Housing Assistance Administration, then a corporate agency of HUD, as \nthe defendant. Although the petitioner in this case is the current Secretary of HUD, this opinion uses the \nterms โpetitionerโ and โHUDโ interchangeably. \n2  The complaint sought to enjoin HUD from providing funds for 17 projects that had been proposed by CHA in \n1965 and 1966 and from making available to CHA any other financial assistance to be used in connection \nwith the racially discriminatory aspects of the Chicago public housing system. In addition, the respondents \nrequested that they be granted โsuch other and further relief as the Court may deem just and equitable.โ \n3  Before the stay of the action against HUD, the District Court had certified the plaintiff class in the CHA \naction and had rejected CHA's motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on the counts of the complaint \nalleging that CHA had intentionally selected public housing sites to avoid desegregating housing patterns. \n265 F.Supp. 582. \n4  CHA admitted that it had followed a policy of informally clearing proposed family public housing sites with the \nalderman in whose ward the proposed site was located and of eliminating each site opposed by the alderman. \n296 F.Supp. 907, 910, 913. This procedure had resulted in the rejection of 99 ยฝ% Of the units proposed for \nsites in white areas which had been initially selected as suitable for public housing by CHA. Id., at 912. \nWith regard to tenant assignments, the court found that CHA had established a racial quota to restrict the \nnumber of Negro families residing in the four CHA family public housing projects located in white areas in \nChicago. The projects, all built prior to 1944, had Negro tenant populations of 7%, 6%, 4%, and 1% Despite the \nfact that Negroes composed about 90% Of the tenants of CHA family housing units and a similar percentage \nof the waiting list. A CHA official testified that until 1968 the four projects located in white areas were listed \non the Authority's tenant-selection form as suitable for white families only. Id., at 909. \n5  In July 1968, CHA had in operation or development 54 family housing projects with a total of 30,848 units. \nStatistics submitted to the District Court established that, aside from the four overwhelmingly white projects \ndiscussed in n. 4, supra, 92% Of all of CHA's family housing units were located in neighborhoods that were at \nleast 75% Negro and that two-thirds of the units were situated in areas with more than 95% Negro residents. \nId., at 910. \n6  The District Court's remedial decree divided Cook County into a โGeneral Public Housing Areaโ and a โLimited \nPublic Housing Area.โ The โLimited Public Housing Areaโ consisted of the area within census tracts having a \n30% Or more nonwhite population or within one mile of the boundary of any such census tract. The remainder \nof Cook County was included in the โGeneral Public Housing Area.โ 304 F.Supp., at 737. Following the \ncommencement of construction of at least 700 family units in the General Public Housing Area of the city of \nChicago, CHA was permitted by the terms of the order to locate up to one-third of its General Public Housing \nArea units in the portion of Cook County outside of Chicago. See id., at 738-739. \n7  The Court of Appeals found that โHUD retained a large amount of discretion to approve or reject both \nsite selection and tenant assignment procedures of the local housing authorityโ and that the Secretary had \nยฉ 2024 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  8 \n \n\n \nHills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976) \n \n96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 \nexercised those powers โin a manner which perpetuated a racially discriminatory housing system in Chicago.โ \n448 F.2d, at 739. Although the appellate court stated that it was โfully sympatheticโ with the โvery real \nโdilemmaโ โ presented by the need for public housing in Chicago, it ruled that the demand for housing did not \njustify โthe Secretary's past actions (which) constituted racially discriminatory conduct in their own right.โ Ibid. \n8  The court's July 1969 order directing CHA to use its best efforts to increase public housing opportunities in \nwhite areas as rapidly as possible had not resulted in the submission of a single housing site to the Chicago \nCity Council. A subsequent order directing the submission of sites for 1,500 units by September 20, 1970, \nhad eventually prompted CHA to submit proposed sites in the spring of 1971, but inaction by the City Council \nhad held up the approval of the sites required for their development. See Gautreaux v. Romney, 332 F.Supp. \n366, 368. \nThe District Court subsequently took additional measures in an attempt to implement the remedial orders \nentered against CHA. In May 1971, the city of Chicago and HUD agreed to a letter of intent that provided that \nthe city would process sites suitable for use by CHA to permit the Authority to commence acquisition of sites \nfor 1,700 units in accordance with a specified timetable. HUD then released certain Model Cities funds on \nthe condition that the City Council and CHA continue to show progress toward meeting the goals set forth in \nthe May letter. After the city fell far behind schedule, the District Court granted the respondents' request for \nan injunction directing HUD to withhold $26 million in Model Cities funds until the city remedied its existing \ndeficit under the timetable. See Id., at 368-370. The Court of Appeals reversed the injunction, holding that \nthe District Court had abused its discretion in ordering funding cut off. 457 F.2d 124. \nBetween July 1971 and April 1972, the City Council failed to conduct any hearings with respect to acquisition \nof property for housing sites and did not approve land acquisition for any sites. Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing \nAuthority, 342 F.Supp. 827, 829. Following the filing of a supplemental complaint naming the mayor and the \nmembers of the City Council as defendants, the District Court found that their inaction had prevented CHA \nfrom providing relief in conformity with the court's prior orders. In a further effort to effectuate relief, the court \nruled that the provision of Illinois law requiring City Council approval of land acquisition by CHA โshall not be \napplicable to CHA's actions . . . taken for the purpose of providing Dwelling Units.โ Id., at 830. the Court of \nAppeals upheld this decision. Gautreaux v. City of Chicago, 480 F.2d 210. \n9  Although CHA participated in the proceeding before the Court of Appeals, it did not seek review of that court's \ndecision and has not participated in the proceedings in this Court. \n10  Although the trial court's desegregation order in Milliken did not direct the adoption of a specific metropolitan \narea plan, it did contain detailed guidelines for the panel appointed to draft the desegregation plan. 345 \nF.Supp. 914 (ED Mich.). The framework for the plan called for the division of the designated 54-school-district \ndesegregation area into 15 clusters, each containing a part of the Detroit school system and two or more \nsuburban districts. Within this framework, the court charged the panel with the responsibility for devising a \nplan that would produce the maximum actual desegregation. Id., at 918, 928-929. See 418 U.S., at 733-734, \n94 S.Ct., at 3121-22, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1084-85. \n11  The Court of Appeals interpreted the Milliken opinion as limited to a determination that, in view of the \nadministrative complexities of school district consolidation and the deeply-rooted tradition of local control of \npublic schools, the balance of equitable factors weighed against metropolitan area school desegregation \nremedies. See 503 F.2d, at 935-936. But the Court's decision in Milliken was premised on a controlling \nprinciple governing the permissible scope of federal judicial power, a principle not limited to a school \ndesegregation context. See 418 U.S., at 744, 94 S.Ct., at 3126-27, 41 L.Ed.2d at 1090-91. \n  9 \n\n \nHills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976) \n \n96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 \nIn addition, the Court of Appeals surmised that either an interdistrict violation or an interdistrict segregative \neffect may have been present in the case. There is no support provided for either conclusion. The sole \nbasis of the appellate court's discussion of alleged suburban discrimination was the respondents' Exhibit \n11 illustrating the location of 12 public housing projects within the portion of the Chicago Urbanized Area \noutside the city limits of Chicago. That exhibit showed that 11 of the 12 projects were located in areas that, \nat the time of the hearing in November 1972, were within one mile of the boundary of a census tract with less \nthan a 70% White population. The exhibit was offered to illustrate the scarcity of integrated public housing \nopportunities for the plaintiff class and for lower income white families and to indicate why the respondents \ndid not โexpect cooperation from the suburban areasโ in providing housing alternatives in predominately white \nareas. In discussing the data underlying the exhibit, counsel for the respondents in the trial court expressly \nattempted to avoid the โpossible misconceptionโ that he was then asserting that the suburban municipalities \nand housing authorities were โguilty of any discrimination or wrongdoing.โ In view of the purpose for which the \nexhibit was offered and the District Court's determination that โthe wrongs were committed within the limits \nof Chicago,โ it is apparent that the Court of Appeals was mistaken in supposing that the exhibit constitutes \nevidence of suburban discrimination justifying metropolitan area relief. \nIn its brief opinion on rehearing, the Court of Appeals asserted that โit is reasonable to conclude from the \nrecordโ that the intracity violation โmay well have fostered racial paranoia and encouraged the โwhite flightโ \nphenomenon which has exacerbated the problems of achieving integration.โ 503 F.2d, at 939-940. The Court \nof Appeals' speculation about the effects of the discriminatory site selection in Chicago is contrary both to \nexpert testimony in the record and the conclusions of the District Court. Such unsupported speculation falls \nfar short of the demonstration of a โsignificant segregative effect in another districtโ discussed in the Milliken \nopinion. See 418 U.S., at 745, 94 S.Ct., at 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d at 1091. \n12  The Court in Milliken required either a showing of an interdistrict violation or a significant segregative effect \nโ(b)efore the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating \nthe separate units for remedial purposes.โ Id., at 744, 94 S.Ct., at 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1091. In its Amicus \nmemorandum in Milliken, the United States argued that an interdistrict remedy in that case would require โthe \nrestructuring of state or local government entitiesโ and result in โjudicial interference with state prerogatives \nconcerning the organization of local governments.โ \n13  Although the State of Michigan had been found to have committed constitutional violations contributing to \nracial segregation in the Detroit schools, 418 U.S., at 734-735, 94 S.Ct., at 3122, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1085, n. 16, \nthe Court in Milliken concluded that the interdistrict order was a wrongful exercise of judicial power because \nprior cases had established that such violations are to be dealt with in terms of โan established geographic \nand administrative school system,โ Id., at 746, 94 S.Ct., at 3128, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1092, and because the State's \neducational structure vested substantial independent control over school affairs in the local school districts. \nSee Id., at 742-744, 94 S.Ct., at 3126-27, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1090-91. In Milliken, a consolidation order directed \nagainst the State would of necessity have abrogated the rights and powers of the suburban school districts \nunder Michigan law. See Id., at 742, 94 S.Ct., at 3126, 41 L.Ed.2d, at 1089-90, n. 20. Here, by contrast, \na metropolitan area remedy involving HUD need not displace the rights and powers accorded suburban \ngovernmental entities under federal or state law. See Part III-B, Infra. \n14  Illinois statutes permit a city housing authority to exercise its powers within an โarea of operationโ defined \nto include the territorial boundary of the city and all of the area within three miles beyond the city boundary \nthat is not located within the boundaries of another city, village, or incorporated town. In addition, the housing \n  10 \n\n \nHills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976) \n \n96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 \nauthority may act outside its area of operation by contract with another housing authority or with a state public \nbody not within the area of operation of another housing authority. Ill.Rev.Stat. c. 67 ยฝ, ss 17(b), 27c (1973). \nAlthough the state officials in Milliken had the authority to operate across school district lines, the exercise \nof that authority to effectuate the court's desegregation order would have eliminated numerous independent \nschool districts or at least have displaced important powers granted those uninvolved governmental entities \nunder state law. See n. 13, Supra. \n15  In principal markets such as Chicago, the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area is coterminous with the \nhousing market area. See Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA Techniques of Housing \nMarket Analysis 13 (Jan. 1970); Department of Housing and Urban Development, Urban Housing Market \nAnalysis 5 (1966). \n16  In the District Court, HUD filed an appendix detailing the various federal programs designed to secure better \nhousing opportunities for low-income families and represented that โthe Department will continue to use its \nbest efforts in review and approval of housing programs for Chicago which address the needs of low income \nfamilies.โ \n17  It was this statutory prohibition that HUD was held to have violated by its funding of CHA's housing projects. \nSee 448 F.2d, at 740. \n18  A HUD study of the implementation of the project-selection criteria revealed that the actual operation of \nthe minority housing opportunity criterion depends on the definition of โarea of minority concentrationโ and \nโracially mixedโ area employed by each field office. The meaning of those terms, which are not defined in \nthe applicable regulations, 24 CFR s 200.710 (1975), varied among field offices and within the jurisdiction \nof particular field offices. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Implementation of HUD Project \nSelection Criteria for Subsidized Housing: An Evaluation 116-117 (Dec. 1972). \n19  In fiscal year 1975, new contract commitments under the s 8 program were approximately $10.7 billion, \nas compared to total estimated new contract commitments of approximately $16.35 billion for all federally \nsubsidized housing programs. The comparable figures for fiscal year 1976 indicate that $22.725 billion of a \ntotal of $24.8 billion in new contract commitments are to be made under the s 8 program. See Hearings on \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development Independent Agencies Appropriations for 1976, before a \nSubcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 5, pp. 85-86 (1975). \nSee also Id., at 119 (testimony of HUD Secretary Hills). \n20  Under the s 8 program, HUD contracts to make payments to local public housing agencies or to private \nowners of housing units to make up the difference between a fair market rent for the area and the amount \ncontributed by the low-income tenant. The eligible tenant family pays between 15% And 25% Of its gross \nincome for rent. See 42 U.S.C. s 1437f (1970 ed., Supp. IV). \n21  If the local unit of government in which the proposed assistance is to be provided does not have an approved \nhousing-assistance plan, the Secretary of HUD is directed by statute to give the local governmental entity \n30 days to comment on the proposal, after which time the Secretary may approve the project unless he \ndetermines that there is not a need for the assistance. 42 U.S.C. s 1439(c) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). In areas \ncovered by an approved plan, the local governmental entity is afforded a 30-day period in which to object to the \nproject on the ground that it is inconsistent with the municipality's approved housing-assistance plan. If such \nan objection is filed, the Secretary may nonetheless approve the application if he determines that the proposal \n  11 \n\n \nHills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976) \n \n96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 \nis consistent with the housing assistance plan. s 1439(a). The local comment and objection procedures do not \napply to applications for assistance involving 12 or fewer units in a single project or development. s 1439(b). \nThe ability of local governments to block proposed s 8 projects thus depends on the size of the proposed \nproject and the provisions of the approved housing-assistance plans. Under the 1974 Act, the housing- \nassistance plan must assess the needs of lower income persons residing in or expected to reside in the \ncommunity and must indicate the general locations of proposed housing for lower income persons selected \nin accordance with the statutory objective of โpromoting greater choice of housing opportunities and avoiding \nundue concentrations of assisted persons.โ 42 U.S.C. s 5304(a)(4)(A), (C)(ii) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). See \nH.R.Rep.No.93-1114, p. 8 (1974). See also City of Hartford v. Hills, 408 F.Supp. 889 (Conn.1976). In view of \nthese requirements of the Act, the location of subsidized housing in predominantly white areas of suburban \nmunicipalities may well be consistent with the communities' housing-assistance plans. \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n  12 ",

IN  OPPOSI  ION  TO  THE \nOTION  OF  DEFENDANT  TO  DISMISS  THE  CTION \nThis  is  a  companion  case  to  GaQtreaux,et  al v. \nChicago Housing Authority,  et al.,  o  66  C J.459.  The  com-\nplaints  in  the  two  cases  are  substantially  identical,  the \nprinciple  difference  being  the  addition  of  the  allegation  in \nthe  complaint  here  that  โขederal  financial  assistance  is pro-\nvided  to  the  Chicago Housing Authority  (the  11CHA11 in  support \n) \nof  the  discriminatory activities  complained  of.  in e  the \nCourt  has  so  recently considered  extensive  briefs  and  oral \nargument  in  respect  of  an  essentially identical  co plaint, \nwe  will not  here  give  a  resume  of  the  allegations  of  the  com-\nplaint.  The  Court  is respectfully  referred  to  the  plaintiffs' \nbrief,  filed  on  December  15,  1966,  in  said  case  o.  66  C 1459, \nfor  such  a  resume. \n\n~--------------------------------------------ยท \nThe  defendant  has  moved  to dismiss  the  action princi-\npally on  three  grounds: \n(1)  lack  of  standing  to  su  (def.br.7a-18); \n(2)  failure  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies \n(def.br.l9-22);  and \n(3)  lack of an  indispensable  party  (def.br.28-32). \nTwo  additional  grounds  are  asserted  (lack  of  subject matter \njurisdiction and  failure  to  state a  claim upon  which  relief \ncan  be  granted),  but  in defendant' s  brief no  point  other  than \nthe  alleged  lack of  standing is  argued  in  support  of  these \ngrounds  (see  def.br.23-27).  Each  of  the  three  arguments  will \nbe  discussed  in  the  order listed. \nI.  Plaintiffs Have  Standing  to Sue \nA.  Under  Counts  I  and  III \nPlaintiffs  in this  case  have  standing  to sue  for  pre-\ncisely  the  same  reasons  as  they do  in  the  camp  nion  case. \nDefendant  argues  (pp.  7a-12)  that plaintiffs lack  standing \non  the  basis  of  the  decision  of  the  Seventh Circuit Court  of \nAppeals  in Harrison Halsted  Community  Group,  Inc.,  et al  v. \nHousing  and  Home  Finance  Agency,  et al,  310  F.2d,  99  (CA  7,1962), \nand  other like  decisions.  The  same  argument  was  rejected by \nthis  Court  in  its order of March  2,  1967  in  the  comp  nion  case. \nIn holding  there  that  the  plaintiff  had  standing  the  Court  said, \n-2-\n\n\"[P)laintiff\"s,  as  present  and  future  users  of \nthe  (public  housing)  system,  have  the  right under \nthe  Fourteenth Amendment  to have  sites  selected for \npublic  hou  ing projects  without  regard  to the  racial \ncomposition  of  either  the  surrounding neighborhood \nor  of  the  projects  themselves.  Possessing  this  right \nand  being  of  the  opinion  that  it is being denied  them, \nplaintiffs may  maintain  this  action  to  determine \nwhether  their opinion is correct,  and  if it is,  to \nsecure  an  appropriate  remedy  to  insure  protection of \ntheir right.\" \nThat  order  is  thus  dispositive  of  defendant' s  standing argument \nwith  one  exception no  to be  discussed. \nDefendant  assert  that  \"the manner  of  selection  of  sites \nfor  low-rent  housing  projects โขโขโข is not  a  function  of  defendant; \nit is a  function  of  the  CHA โขโขโข \"  (def. br. ,  p.  (a ) .  Since the \ndefendant  does  not  perform  that function,  the  argument  runs, \n\"he  cannot be  charged with  inflicting an  injury which  result \nfrom  the  performance  thereof.\"  (Ibid.)  In  other words,  the  de-\nfendant  is  supposed  to be  a  bystander,  having no  function  to \nperform  in  ite  selection and  therefore  no  responsibility for \nthe  CHA's  discriminatory  site  selection practices.  Therefore, \nalthough plaintiffs can  sue  CHA,  they  can't  sue  defendant โข . \nThe  argument  is untenable.  It is clear  that although \nthe  defendant  does  not make  the  initial selection of  sites,  it \nis centrally involved  in every aspect  of  the  operation  of  the \nCHA,  sets  the  site  selection  standards  or  criteria with which \n-3-\n\nthe  CHA  must  comply,  and  has  and  exercises  the  power  to  approve \nor  disapprove  every  site  selected by  CHA.  This  is acknowledged \nin  derendant's  own  briefs,  as  the  rollowing quotations  show: \n11HUD,  under  the Annual  Contributions  Contract, \nrequires  certain approvals  by  it of  some  of  the  ac \ntions  taken  by  the  Housing Authorities.  One  of  these \napprovals  relates  to  the  Chicago Housing Authority' s \naction which  is  the  subject matter  of  this  suit,  i.e., \nsite  selection. 11  (p.  7) \n\"Section 103,  together with  section 102,  of  Part \nTwo  of  the  Annual  Contributions  Contract,  also  recog \nnizes  the  right  of  HUD  to approve  or  to  disapprove  a \nsite  selected by  the  Housing Authority  \"  (p.  7) \n\"HUD  has  approved  the  sites  selected  by  the  Chicago \nHousing Authority  for  the  1965  projects,  referred  to  in \nthe  Complaint  in this  suit as  fThe  Five  Proposed  Pro \njects. '  With  respect  to  the  sites for  the  1966  projects, \nreferred  to  in  the  Complaint  as  the  'Twelve  Proposed \nProjects, '  HUD  is negotiating with  the  Chicago Housing \nAuthority  the  question  of approval  of  these  sites.\"  (p.7) \n\"[T]he  following  sites  included  in  the  1966  projects \nhave  been  approved:  [listing omitted)  Determination as \nto  the  remaining  sites  involved  in  the  1966  projects  has \nnot  been made,  and  no  approval  has  been  given by  HUD  as \nto  those  remaining  sites which  are  being held  in abey \nance.\"  (p.2,  First Supplemental Memorandum.) \n\"In practical operation  of  the  low-rent housing \nprogram,  the  existence  of  the  program  is  entirely de \npendent  upon  continuing,  year  to year,  Federal  financial \nassistance.\"  (p.S) \n\"Upon  failure  to  live up  to  the  req:lirements  of  the \nFederal  law  or certain provisions  of  the  Annual  Contribu \ntions  Contract  (see  Part Two,  Article V,  thereof),  the \nFederal Government  reserves  the  right  to  demand  title or \npossession  of  the  projects.\"  {p.6) \n-4-\n\nFinally,  defendant's  second  supplemental  brief makes  clear \nthat  th  site  selection criteria are  established  by  the  de \nfendant's  gency. \nIt borders  on  the  ridiculous  to argue  that  Governmental \nAgency  A,  upon  which Agency  B is  \"entirely dependent\"  financially, \nwhich  establishes  site selection criteria,  which  has  among  other \npower  the  right  to approve  or  disapprove  B's  site  selections, \nand  which  exercises  that power  and  \"negotiates\"  such  approval  or \ndisapproval,  has  no  function  to perform  in connection with  B' \nsite  selections  and  is  therefore  not  subject  to  suit  if B's  site \nselection practices  are  racially discriminatory. \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  held  in a  number  of  cases  involv \ning  charges  of unconstitutional  discrimination  that a  governmental \nagency  ay be  sued  in connection with  such  discrimination  if it \nparticipates  in the  activities  complained  of  \"through any  arrange \nment,  management,  funds  or property.\"  Cooper  v.  Aaron,  358  u.s.  1, \n4  (1958).  See  also,  Burton  v.  Wi~ington Parking Authority, \n365  U.S.  715  (1961).  In  Burton  a  state agency  sought  to  insulate \nitself from  the  discriminatory practices  of a  restaurant  lessee \non  the  ground  that  it had  \"not  purported  to  dictate  to  the  res \ntaurant  as  to how  its business  shwld  be  run.\"  150 A2d  197,  at 198. \n-5-\n\nBut  the  Supreme  Court  said, \n\"The  State has  so  far  insinuated  itself into \na  position  of interdependence  with  [the \nrestaurant  lessee]  that  it must  be  recognized \nas  a  joint participant in  the  challenged  ac \ntivity โขโขโข \"  365  U.S.  715  at 725. \nAnd  in Simkins  v.  Moses  H.  Cone  Memorial  Hospital,  323  F2d  959 \n{CA4,  1963),  involving  discrimination  by  hospitals  receiving \nfederal  funds,  the  court found  that  \"defendant hospitals  operate \nas  integral parts  of comprehensive  joint or  intermeshing  state \nand  federal  plans  or programs, \"  {323  F2d  959,  at 967)  and  de-\nclared unconstitutional  provisions  of  federal  statutes  and \nregulations  which  were  viewed  as  authorizing discrimination by \nstate  institutions.  It held  that  the  Negro  plaintiffs,  doctors \nand  prospective  patients  suing  on  behalf  of  Negroes  generally, \nhad  standing  to  contest  the  constitutionality of  the  federal \nstatute.  323  F2d  959,  at 969-70. \nPlainly  the  defendant's  \"j:Jlnt  participationn  in  the \nCHA's  discriminatory practices  is governmental  action which may \nbe  prohibited under  the  Constitution.  Accordingly,  for  the \nreasons  given  in  the  Court's  order  of March  2,  1967  in  the  com-\npanion  case,  plaintiffs have  standing  to  sue. \n-6-\n\nB.  Under  Counts  II and  IV \nCounts  II and  IV  are  based upon  Section 601  of  the \nCivil Rights  Act  of 1964.  We  have  argued  in  the  companion \ncase  that plaintiffs have  standing  to  sue  under  this  section, \nand  the  Court's  order of March  2,  1967  in  that  case  so  holds. \nBut  defendant,  while  conceding  that  \"under  some  circumstances\" \nthat  section  [601)  may  \"give  standing  to private persons  to \nseek  relief against  the  local Agency\"  (def.br.25),  argues \nthat no  such  standing  is conferred as  against  the  defendant. \nThe  decision  in Green  Street Association  v.  Daley,  373  F2d  1 \n(CA  7,  1967)  supports  this  view.  The  reasoning  in Green \nStreet was  that  since  Sections  602  and  603  of  Title VI  pro \nvide  a  procedure  for Federal  officials  to  follow  if they wish \nto  cut  off  funds  to  recipients  who  violate Section 601,  the \nflow  of Federal funds  may  not be  cut off  in any  other manner. \n373  F2d,  at 8-9. \nWe  believe  this  conclusion  to be  erroneous  for \nseveral  reasons: \nFirst,  Sections  6o2  and  603  govern  Federal  officials \nwho  seek  to cut  off funds  from  recipients.  They  have  no  ap \nplication  to  the  situation presented here,  where  Federal \nofficials  decline  to cut  off funds  but  on  the  contrary con \ntinue  to make  them  available  to a  discriminatory program. \n-7-\n\nThe  Government  itself has  refuted  the  argument \nthat  the  Section  602  and  603  procedures  available  to Federal \nofficials who  seek  to  cut  off funds  someho  preclude  the  pos-\nsibility of a  private  right  of action under  the  Act.  In  the \nGovernment's  brief 1n  Bossier Parish School  Board  v.  Lemon, \n370  F2d  847  (CA5,  1967),  the  following  appears  at pages  23-25 \nand  28: \n\"Defendants  claim that  the  administrative  remedie \nafforded  the  United  States are  the  exclusive means \nof  enforcing compliance  with  the  tatutory duty \nimposed  by  section 601.  This  position is untenable. \n\"section 601  is  intended  to ensure  that no \nper  on  who  participates  in or  is  the  beneficiary \nof  any  program  or activity receiving  federal  finan \ncial assistance  ill be  subject  to  discrimination \non  the  ground  of  race,  color  or national  origin. \nPlaintiffs,  who  attend  schools  receiving federal \nfinancial  assistance,  are  persons  whom  this  statute \nis designed  to  prot ct.  While  the  statute  doe  not \nexpressly afford plaintiffs a  remedy  for  violation \nof  its prohibition,  they are  not  thereby  precluded \nfrom  obtaining appropriate  relief.  On  the  contrary, \nunder  such  circumstances  the  Supreme  Court  in Texas \n& Pacific Ry.  v.  Rigsby,  241  U.S.  33,  39  (1916}  de \nclared: \n\"  'A  disregard  of  the  command  of  the \nstatute  is a  wrongful  act,  and  where  it \nresults  in damage  to  one  of  the  class  for \nwhose  special  benefit  the  statute was  en \nacted,  the  right  to  recover  the  damages \nfrom  the  party  in default  is  implied,  ac \ncording  to a  doctrine  of  the  common  la \nexpressed  in 1  Com.  Dig.,  Tit.  Action \nupon  Statute  (F),  in these words:  \"So, \nin every  case,  where  a  statute  enacts,  or \n-8-\n\nprohibits  a  thing  for  the  benefit  of \nperson,  he  shall h  ve  a  remedy  upon  the \nsam  statute  for  th  thing  enacted  for \nhi  advant  ge,  or for  the  recompen  e  of \na  wrong  done  to him  contrary  to  the  said \nlaw.\"  ' \n\"Thu  ~  in Fitzgerald v.  P  Am  rican  orld \nAirwals,  229  F2d  499  (CA  2,  1956),  pl  intiff \nsued  Pan Americ  n  for  civil  d  ages  alleging \nthat defendant  had  discriminat d  against her \nb  caus  of race  in the  operation  ot  its  irl1nes. \nSh  predicated her claim on  49  u.s.c.484(b), \n(now  49  u.s.c.  1374(b)  ),  which  a  interpreted by \nthe  court,  prohibited  the  conduct  of  hich  sh \ncompl  ined.  Ther  wa  ,  however,  no  civil re  edy \nprovided by  the Act  to  redress  her grievance  -\nonly  provision m king  a  viol  tion  of  section \n484(b)  a  cri e.  49  u.s.c.  622(a),  (no  49  u.s.c. \n1492(a)).  co  plaint procedure  authorized  any \nperson  to notify th  Civil Aeron  utic  Board  of \ny  violation 49  u.s .c.  642(a),  (a  end  d  49 \nu.s.c.  1482(  )).  The  Board  h  d  th  pow  r  to \ninvestigate  th  claim and,  upon  findin  a  viola \ntion,  issue  an  ppropri  te  order  to co  pel  co  -\npliance.  49  u.s.c.  642(b)(c)  (  ended  49  u.s.c. \n1482(b)(c)).  Fully cognizant of  this  procedure, \nthe  court  held  that  a  violation of  49  u.s .c . \n484(b)  created  'an  actionable  civil right  for \nthe  vindication  of which  a  civil action  ay  be \nmaintained by any  uch  person  ho  h  been \nharmed  by  th  violation.โข  229  F2d  t  501. \n*  *  * \n\"So  here,  the  benefits  accorded  and  th \nrights  conferred  on  these  plaintiff  under  sec \ntion 601  would  be  empty  and  illusory if the \ncourts  do  not  compel  the  perform nee \nt  '  statutory obligation. \n.;;.;R..;.e...;d.;.;.r.;.;.e;;;;.;;;..__;;..;;......~~-= \ntiff  โข  grievance  cannot  depend \n-9-\n\nGovernment  elects  to  invoke  the  sanctions  avail \nable  under  section b02 โขโขโขโข  The  Congressional \npolicy expressed  in  section 601,  moreover,  will \nbe  furthered  by allowing  parties  to bring actions \nto  secure  rights under  that  section.\"  {emphasis \nsupplied) \nAlthough Lemon  was  a  suit against  local,  not  federal  de-\nfendante,  the  argument  made  in  the  Government's  brief does \nnot  turn  on  that fact.  It is persuasive whoever  the  de-\nfendant  may  be. \nSecond,  the  Fifth Circuit  in Bossier  Parish School \nBoard  v.  Lemon,  370  F2d  847  {CA5,  1967),  considered  and \nrejected  the  argument  that Sect1on  6021 S  administrative \nremedies  were  the  only means  by which  Section 601  could be \nenforced.  The  holding of Lemon  is  that, \n11In  the  absence  of a  procedure  through which  the \nindividuals protected by  section 6011s  prohibi \ntion may  assert  their  rights under  it,  violations \nof  the  law are  cognizable  by  the  courts. 11 \n370  F2d,  at 852. \nAs  the  Seventh Circuit  correctly states,  Section 602  estab-\nlishes  \"the procedure  to be  followed by federal  officials.\" \n373  F2d,  at 8-9.  Section 602  does  not purport  to  establish \na  procedure  through which  individuals  - such  as  the  plaintiffs \nhere  - can  vindicate  their Section 601  rights.  Accordingly, \n-10-\n\nviolations  of Section  601  are  cognizable  by  the  courts \nwhether  the  violators  re  federal  or  local  officials. \nThird,  there  is no  basis  in the language  of Title VI \nof  the  Civil Rights  Act  of 1964  to support  the  view  that \nSection  601  gives  persons  subjected  to discrimination \nstanding  to  sue  under  that Act  the  local  officials  involved \nbut  not  the  federal  officials who  decline  to  cut  off  the \nflow  of  funds  which makes  that  discrimination possible.  Such \na  distinction  seems  illogical.  Federal  funds  can  be  st opped, \nwith equal  effectiveness,  by  blocking  their receipt  and  use \n{by  local  officials)  or by  prohibiting  their di  bursement \n{by  federal  officials).  In  either case  the  flow  of money \nwill  cease. \nFinally,  the  statement  that  the  administrative  pro \ncedures  of  Sections  602  and  603  would  be  bypassed  by  allowing \na  private  right  of action against  federal  officials misses \nthe  point.  Congress  has  traditionally been hesitant  to \nentrust unfettered  discretion  to  the  \"nameless,  faceless \nbureaucrat\"  in Washington.  Where  the  power  to  cut  off  funds \nto  the  enormous  number  of  programs  now  receiving Federal \n-11-\n\nII. \n1  t.  r  11  d \nr  1  0  th \n-\n\nregulations  promulgated  to effectuate Title VI  of  the  Civil \nRights  Act  of 1964  (def.br.,  pp.l9-22).  The  argument,  of \ncourse,  applies  only  to Counts  II and  IV  of  the  Complaint, \nand  it is defective  for  two  separate  reasons:  (1)  there  is \nno  administrative  remedy  available  to plaintiff under  the \n1964 Civil Rights  Act,  and  (2)  even if there  were,  it would \nhave  been  futile  to attempt  to  secure  relief under  it. \nThe  \"administrative  remedy\"  is not  really an  ad-\nministrative  remedy  at all.  The  supposed  remedy  consists \nof  a  regulation which  says  that a  person may  file a  \"written \ncomplaint.\"  (The  regulation  is quoted  at page  19  of  de-\nfendant's  brief.)  There  is no  provision  for  a  hearing, \nto  take  any  action at all based  upon  the  \"complaint.\"  The \nargument  appears  to  be  that  if a  Governmental  Agency  issues \na  regulation authorizing a  citizen to write  it a  letter of \ncomplaint,  it has  thereby  created an  administrative  remedy. \nThe  short  answer  is  that  citizens  do  not  need  governmental \nagencies  to authorize  them  to  write  letters,  and  such pur-\nported authorization  is not  an  \"administrative  remedy.\" \nBut  the  effort to  employ  the  \"remedy\"  would  have \nbeen futile  in any  event.  The  complaint  seeks  relief respecting \n-13-\n\nsites  elected by  th  CHA  in 1965  and  1966.  Some  of  the \n1965  ites were  th  ubject  of  a  letter of  comol  int  to \nthe  def ndant.  (see  xhibit A  to  th  ff1davit  acco  p  ny-\n1ng  this  brief.)  Th  complaint was  parried  by a  seven- ge \nletter ov  r  the  sign ture  of  the  same  administrator  ho h \nsigned  the  affidavits  tiled in  support  of  def  ndantโขs  motion. \n{See  Exhibit  to th  af  i  vit accompanying  thi  brief.) \nTh  response  a  not  ba  d  on  specific  factual  det  in  -\ntion  re  p  cting each  1te complained  of but  upon  gener  1 \nt  te  ents  of policy and  hi  tory  pplicable  to the  ite \nselection policies  ot the  CHA  in general.  itbout denying \nthat  sel ction of the  site  in question wo  ld  perpetuate \np  tt rn  of  egr  atio  ,  the  r  pon  e  st t  d  defendant \nwou  d  not  overrule CHA's  ite  el ction for  the  reason, \nothers  \"th t  sites other than  in th  outh  or w st \nside,  it propo  ed  tor  r  gul  r  f  ily hou  in  ,  invariably \nencounter  suff1cl nt oppo  ition in  the  (City]  Co  neil  to \npr elude  Council  a  prov  \"  (Exhibit B,  p.6) \nThe  t  111  r  rule  is that wh  n  an  dmin1strat1  e \nagency's  nnounc  d  iew  or polici  r  ch  th t  nlain-\ntift'  pplicat1on  for  the  rel1  f  he  e  ks  ould  almo  t \n-14-\n\ncertainly be  rejected,  the  courts will  not  require  the \nplaintiff to make  the  futile  gesture  as  a  prerequisite \nto  granting  judicial relief.  See,  for  example,  School \nBoard  of  City  of  v.  Allen,  240  F2d  59, \nCharlottesvill~ Va. \nat 63-64  (CA  4,  1956),  and  Koepke  v.  Fontecchio,  177  F2d  125, \nat 128  (CA  9,  1949),  both holding  that where  pursuit  of \nthe  administrative  remedy  would  have  been  futile,  the \ncourts would  not  require  the  vain  effort of  seeking ad-\nministrative  relief.  Defendant's  rejection of  the  letter of \ncomplaint which  it did  receive  clearly brings  this  case  with-\nin  that  rule. \nAccordingly,  for  each  of  the  two  reasons  given \nabove,  defendant' s  motion,  so  far as  based  on  the  admin-\nistrative remedies  doctrine,  must  be  denied. \nIII.  The  Granting  of  Plaintiffs'  Motion  to Consolidate \nWill  Obviate  the  Objection  that  the  CHA  is an \nIndispensable  Party to  This  Action. \nThis  case  is a  companion  to Gautraux,  et al  v. \nChicago Housing Authority,  et al,  No.  66  C 1459.  Both \ncases  were  filed  on  the  same  day  by  the  same  plaintiffs. \nThe  cases  were  assigned  as  \"related cases\"  to  the  same \n-15-\n\nJudge.  The  complaints  are  identical with  the  exception  that \nthe  complaint  in this  case  contains  allegations  respecting \nthe  employment  of  federal  funds  which  are  not made  in \nNo.  66  C 1459. \nUnder  these  circumstances,  it would  plainly be \nappropriate  to consolidate  the  two  cases  for  purposes  of \ndiscovery  and  trial.  Plaintiffs have  so moved.  The \ngranting of  this motion  ill obviate  the  objection  that \nan  order in  this  case might  \"drastically affect  the  right \nof  the  Chicago Housing Authority\"  (def.br.  29),  and  that \ntherefore  the  Court  should  not  proceed without  having  the \nCHA  before  it. \nCONCLUSION \nIt is  respectfully  submitted  that  defendant' s \nmotion  should  be  denied  and  that  this  case  and  case \nNo.  66  C 1459  should be  consolidated  for  purposes  of  dis-\ncovery and  trial. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nOne  of  the  Attorneys  for  Plaintiffs \nAlexander  Poli koff \nCharles  R.

      "text": "Transcript: \nArgument of Bork\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: We will hear arguments next in 1047, Hills against Gautreaux.\nMr. Solicitor General.\nMr. Bork: Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.\nWe are here on writ certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\nThe history of this litigation is rather complex, but I think the facts that need to be stated for purposes of this review are\nstated rather briefly.\nRespondents are six black residents of Chicago who brought this action in 1966 against a Department, an Agency of\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nOn behalf of a class of black tenants in and applicants for public housing projects in Chicago, their claim which was\nsubsequently upheld by the courts was that hard-aided public housing through financial assistance to the Chicago\nHousing Authority and that when it made that financial aid it knew that members of the Chicago City Council were\nblocking the efforts of Chicago Housing Authority to place this housing in white residential neighborhoods thus\nreinforcing patterns of residential segregation and most of the tenants and applicants here were black.\nIt should be said in this case by the way, I think it is of some interest that when we -- as this case is developed, to\nphrase a black residential neighborhood or a limited housing neighborhood means one with more than 30% blacks.\nSo it can be 30% black and 70% white and still for purposes of this case be described as a black neighborhood or it can\nbe within one mile of any such census tract that still be described as a black neighborhood.\nRespondents brought a companion suit against the Chicago Housing Authority and the Court found that that authority\nhad in fact engaged in these discriminatory practices.\nIt issued an injunction among the terms of which were an order to halt the practices, to build the next 700 dwelling units\nin the substantial a year over 70% white residential areas of Chicago and to locate at least three fourths of those units\nwould be in those neighborhoods.\nNow, in the parallel action against HUD, the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Courts\ndismissal of the complaint and held that HUDโs knowing act re-essences in CHAs, Chicago Housing Authorities\nadmittedly discriminatory housing program brought HUD in the violation of the Fifth Amendment and of Section 601 of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nI make no contention here of course that HUD did not violate those provisions by knowingly funding Chicago Housing\nAuthority, but I think simple justice to the HUD officials involved requires me at least to note that during the time of the\nviolation according to District Court, HUD made efforts, consistent efforts to correct what was happening and had\nsucceeded in some respects and the Court of Appeals itself said that was fully sympathetic with HUDโs dilemma of\nbeing forced to choose between the funding of construction of public housing in black neighborhoods or denying housing\nall together to thousands of needy Negro families.\nThe Court of Appeals on that appeal emphasized that its holding should not be construed as granting a broad license to\ninterfere with the programs and actions of what it described as an already beleaguered Federal Agency and it suggest\nthat the District Court might find that little equitable relief was needed beyond a best-efforts clause necessary to remedy\nthe wrongs that had been committed.\nAt that point in the District Court, the actions against HUD and CHA were consolidated.\nThe District Court did enter a best-efforts clause and they were still outstanding of course against HUD and they were\nstill outstanding of course the relief against the Chicago Housing Authority.\nThe District Court specifically rejected plaintiffsโ proposal for a hearings to develop a plan of metropolitan relief for the\nareas surrounding the City of Chicago.\nUpon appeal, a wholly new panel of the Seventh Circuit with one Judge dissenting, reversed and remanded for\nconsideration of a comprehensive metropolitan area plan and that is the order.\n\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Mr. Solicitor General in the District Court, did the plaintiffs' request for a metropolitan\nremedy, was it accompanied by a prayer to join the outlying housing authorities?\nMr. Bork: I do not recall whether there was a prayer at that stage.\nThere was a prayer which was granted in the District Court after the remand from the Court of Appeals.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: I mean before the Court of Appeals?\nMr. Bork: Well, I believe there was a request.\nYes there was.\nI believe there was a request to join them in the prospect in the District Court before the appeal so that a much\n(Inaudible) plan could be drawn up.\nBut the Court of Appeals ordered that a comprehensive metropolitan area plan be now considered is what is judicial\nhere, meanwhile District Court has permitted respondents to file a supplemental complaint to add as partyโs defendant.\nThe 11 Local Housing Authorities outside the City of Chicago as well as the Illinois Housing Development Authority, the\nNortheastern Illinois Planning Commission and the Director of the Illinois Department of Local Government Affairs and\nrespondentsโ current assertion in this Court is that housing in six Illinois Counties, Cook, a part of which is the City of\nChicago, but much of which is not.\nDuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will, those counties which contain 12 Local Housing Authorities and over 300 cities,\nvillages and townships are the area which should be swept into this case and put under judicial supervision and used as\na remedy, to remedy an act of segregation that occurred entirely within the City of Chicago.\nNow, none of these counties or housing authorities or municipalities has been in this case previously.\nNone of them has been found to have committed any acts of discrimination, much less any acts of discrimination\nrelated in any way to what happened in Chicago.\nThe objection of the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is precisely this.\nThe secretary of HUD will be required to impose obligations upon communities that are without fault in order to achieve a\nremedy for respondents that runs contrary to statutory obligations and a remedy that is not premised entirely upon\nwrong doing in Chicago.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Are you arguing in a sense into the absence of indispensable parties?\nMr. Bork: I am not actually Mr. Justice Rehnquist.\nI am arguing at this case is like Milliken against Bradley in the sense that District Court is being directed in effect by the\nCourt of Appeals to exceed the scope of allowable equitable remedies and I am arguing also that the Swann case has\nsomething to say here about this case.\nI think --\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Do you defend the District Courtโs refusal to permit the joining of these outlying districts\nfor the purpose of offering proof?\nMr. Bork: No.\nIf the -- I think of the plaintiffs, I think this case is just like the Milliken.\nIf the plaintiffs allege and prove an inter-district violation, we would have a different case.\nBut that is not the posture this case is in now and I think as this Court said in Milliken, a controlling principle which is\nconsistently been stated in the holdings of this Court is that the scope of the remedy is determined by the nature and\nthe extent of the violation and as the concurring opinion put it there, the Courts there were in error for the simple reason\nthat they thought what the remedy they thought necessary was simply not commensurate with the constitutional\nviolation found and that is what I think is difficulty here.\n\nI want to discuss Milliken, but I first want to develop a point which is not fully developed in our brief, although it is\npresent and which in and of itself seems to me fully dispositive of this case.\nAs I said, respondents here proved a violation which was entirely within the City of Chicago and relief was ordered there\nquite properly and on this last appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeals ordered consideration of metropolitan relief.\nNow, it gave a couple of reasons why it thought metropolitan relief was essential.\nOne was, that intra city relief had become less valuable while the case was pending because the number of\nneighborhoods with fewer than 30% black or outside of one mile within a census tract of less than 30% black residence\nhad declined so that there was difficulty getting sites to put enough public housing in areas with more than 70% white\npopulation.\nWell, I think it is important to ask why that is true and it is true not because of any action by any Governmental Unit.\nIt is true because of demographic shifts, shifts in residential patterns in the Chicago area.\nThousands of individuals and families made personal choices which they are legally free to make and as result we are\ntold the Federal Courts must pursue those demographic shifts into outlying cities and townships and municipalities.\nThe Court is not pursuing Governmental action, or anything connected with Governmental action.\nThey are pursuing populations and demographic shifts.\nNow, the other thing, the Court of Appeals said and it is quite clear in its opinion, is that it was reacting not to the\nconstitutional violation in Chicago, but it was reacting to the phenomenon of white flight and it was reacting to\nsociological and demographic predictions about the distant future, 1984 was mentioned, the year 2000 was mentioned.\nThe remedy in short is actually addressed to a predicted de facto segregation and not to the limited proven de jure\nsegregation in public housing in Chicago.\nI happened to think that the sociological and demographic predictions made by the Court of Appeals are not accurate\nand if sociology were relevant to this Court, to this case, I would think that the remedy chosen to deal with sociological\ntrends is the worst possible remedy one could choose, but that is not the point.\nChasing demographic shifts and attacking purely de facto living patterns I think is not a proper remedial function of\nCourts and I think this Court recognized that fact in Swann against Charlotte-Mecklenburg and that seems to me\nsufficient to require reversal of the Court of Appeals here.\nBut aside from the principle of Swann, there is the holding of Milliken against Bradley.\nThis violation took place as I have said repeatedly within the City of Chicago and it is therefore inappropriate to frame\nrelief in an area that encompasses 300 other Governmental Units, more than 300 other towns and villages with a\ncomplete strangers to the action and to the violation.\nNow, respondent's attempted answer to this is that this is not inter-district relief in the Milliken sense because it is not\ninter-district relief as to HUD, since HUD may operate over metropolitan areas.\nThat is fallacious, that answer is fallacious for two reasons.\nThe first is, that this remedy, even if it is nominally directed or actually directed only against HUD in a legal sense, will\nactually destroy the autonomy and some of the political processes of the cities and housing authorities, who have no\nconnection with the violation in Chicago and secondly, I think it is irrelevant, it is a fallacious answer because the\nremedy would compel HUD and this cannot be gotten around, this remedy would compel HUD to ignore obligations\nplaced upon it by Congress.\nNow, respondentโs argument as to the first point is that the 1974 Act permits HUD to bypass local communities and to\ndeal with private developers.\nAnd that --\nJustice Potter Stewart: With that geographical restriction, if any?\nMr. Bork: Well, I think they may deal with private developers.\n\nI do not think they used to comply with the zoning ordinance and so forth in the city you are in.\nJustice Potter Stewart: That was within a -- given metropolitan community or --?\nMr. Bork: Yes.\nThey deal with private developers in any particular community, but under certain limitations.\nBut my first point is that even if those limitations were not present in the statute about what HUD may do, it is wrong to\nsay that these communities are not being involved in this lawsuit because the result would still be that communities that\nhave done nothing wrong whatever and that neither need nor want any public housing would have public housing placed\nupon them by Court order.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: Does HUD have authority of imminent domain to condemn land itself or must it operate\nthrough State and Local Housing Authorities?\nMr. Bork: It must operate through communities, State or Local Housing Authorities or with private developers under\ncertain limitations.\nBut it does not -- HUD does not build these.\nCurrently, HUD is not building anything, it is not seizing property.\nIt is subsidizing rental.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: But some Federal Agencies do have power of imminent domain, is that not?\nMr. Bork: I believe that is true.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: But had you represent trust that they do not have that power?\nMr. Bork: That is correct.\nThey do not --\nUnknown Speaker: They would have authority in your view to to enter into a contract with a private builder to erect a\nhousing project contrary to local zoning laws --\nMr. Bork: No.\nUnknown Speaker: Does not the decree of a -- does not the final paragraph of the opinion of the Court of Appeals in\neffect mandate that?\nMr. Bork: When I think what is going to happen and in fact mandates if it work, but respondents say that the decree\ndoes not allow them to nor do they wish to override local zoning ordinance.\nIt is not what is going to happen as a practical matter in the area around Chicago is it zoning changes are going to have\nto be requested to put up multi family dwellings of this size and has to be at least of a certain size, 50 to 100 families to\nmake it economically feasible.\nJustice Lewis F. Powell: But since the Local Agencies, the Local Housing Authorities and the Local Governmental\nBodies were not parties to the case, what sanction will that be to compel and to comply with the --?\nMr. Bork: Well, I assume Mr. Justice Powell either in this case or in a separate case we will then have serious of\nlitigation about whether refusal to make zoning changes or variances was discriminatory.\nI think that is the way it would have to work out.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: But certainly Judge Austin if he is still on the case or if his successor might well feel that\nthe issue of the availability of a metropolitan remedy would be foreclosed in favor of a metropolitan remedy by the Court\nof Appeals opinion here, might it not?\nMr. Bork: I think that Judge Austin, with the direction in that opinion and that order is bound to feel that he has to enter\nsome kind of a metropolitan remedy.\nBut my point is, that quite aside from the limitations placed upon HUD, and I think this is an important point, about\n\ndealing with local communities, if it were true, which it is not, if it were true that HUD could deal with private developers\nand ignore the local community, those local communities would have public housing they do not need, they do not want,\nthey have committed no constitutional violation, and they are going to provide the services with a police protection, the\nfire protection, the additional schooling for families with children, to benefit citizens of Chicago.\nBut, and I want to say this, my point is not merely, that that is not a proper equitable remedy.\nMy point is, that a rather extraordinary legal principle is being formulated here.\nWell, we remember what happened in this case.\nChicago Housing Authority was held responsible because of the acts of the Chicago City Council.\nHUD was then held responsible because of the acts of the Chicago Housing Authority and now wholly uninvolved Town\nGovernments are to be held responsible because HUD can reach them, that is all.\nHUD is to be made in to a conduit through which the impact of local violations flows outward to all other Governments in\nthe area, the respondents or the District Court think it useful to reach.\nNow, I say that is an extraordinary legal principle because it is Federal Assistance and Federal Authority increases not\nonly in this field, but in all kinds of fields.\nThat principle will expand the equitable powers of District Courts to unheard of dimensions.\nIn this very case, I think, it is clear that this Court has been pushed from performing a traditional, judicial function of\nframing an equitable remedy into a position what is going to become necessarily a metropolitan wide land use and\nsocial planning agency on a continuing basis.\nI think all of that would be bad enough, but it is also true in respondentโs brief, I think obscures this fact that\nmetropolitan relief would require HUD to violate limitations built into which authority by Congress.\nNow, it is all very well, I think respondent's counsel say that Congress contemplated metropolitan planning and that\nHUD officials endorsed metropolitan planning and that is entirely true.\nHUD does that and HUD will continue to think in planning metropolitan terms regardless of the outcome of this case.\nBut it is also true that in metropolitan planning Congress has placed limitations and processes that must be observed\nand that a Court order would have to sweep away.\nAnd the relief proposed here, I think would reverse the Congressional thrust in the 1974 Amendments to 1974 Housing\nAct to return more decision making to local communities and let me indicate briefly a couple of examples of how\ncoercion would be necessary or how violation of HUDโs statutory mandate would be necessary.\nOne example, a community which receives funding from HUD for community development activities under the Block\nGrant Program which is Title I of the 1974 Act, is required to prepare a housing assistance plan of its own housing\nneeds in that community as part of its application.\nNow, the statute requires or it is required that that housing assistance plan must be prepared by citizen participation\nincluding two public hearings for the citizens and it must be later reviewed and commented upon by the relevant area\nwide planning agencies to the State or the locality.\nHUD cannot unilaterally decide to work with a private developer in order to put up a public housing in that community.\nInstead, HUD is require under Section 213 of the Act to forward any proposal by private developer for public housing to\nthe community and the community is required to determine whether or not that proposal is consistent with its housing\nassistance plan which it has been required to make and which had been made through citizen participation.\nIf a community says their proposal for public housing is not consistent, then Secretary cannot go forward unless she\ndetermines, despite that, that the proposal is consistent with the communityโs own housing assistance plan, and if HUD\ndoes that and goes forward, and the community disagrees then the community may seek judicial review.\nThat is all built into the 1974 Act.\nAny community and the number of these communities do that has the Block Grant Program and a Housing Assistance\nProgram, all of this would have to be swept away if you are talking about HUD dealing with the private developer without\n\ninterfering with the community.\nIf a town is not a participant in that plan, then Section 213 CF, Title II applies, secretary consults with the town, of\ncourse the townโs wished has have influence, but the secretary shall not approve a proposal there, even from a private\ndeveloper, unless she determines that there is need for Federally Assisted Public Housing, taking into consideration the\napplicable State plans and finding that there is or will be available in the area public facilities and services adequate to\nservice, their proposed development.\nNow, I think that Court ordered metropolitan relief in this case no matter how gently it has gone about, no matter how it\ntrained is bound to require HUD to ignore the safeguards of local autonomy and local political processes, the very\nsafeguards that the Congress deliberately built into the 1974 Act.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Mr. Solicitor General, what if there had been as there was not before the Court of Appeals\nruling, a hearing in the District Court after a complaint in which all of the outlying authorities had been joined and there\nhad been a finding by the District Court of inter-district violations on the part of all.\nWould not that put the case in a somewhat different posture?\nMr. Bork: That would put the case in an entirely different posture Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but we have here the remedy\nappropriate to a case which is not here which is our problem.\nFinally, there is not a shred of evidence in this case that anything done within Chicago produced any segregatory effect\nin any other city and certainly not segregatory effect between Chicago and any other city.\nNow, there is Exhibit 11 which has been offered in this case and which is a map that is at the back of respondentsโ brief\nand I must say, that that Exhibit 11 does not prove anything.\nIt does not prove segregation.\nIt does not even raise a prima-facie case of segregation in any outlying city and it certainly does not prove any causation\nbetween what happened in public housing in Chicago and the situation in any outlying city.\nRemember that these shaded areas, these limited housing areas, they get shaded if they are more than 30% black,\nthose are not solid black communities or they get shaded if they are within one mile of a 30% black census tract.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: How did this come in to the record?\nMr. Bork: Respondents' counsel drew this map and put it into the record to indicate that there were no alternatives\navailable to respondents to move into public housing in white areas outside of Chicago.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Well, how was it authenticated?\nMr. Bork: I do not believe, I mean, I am subject to correction, but I do not believe it is authenticated.\nI think it was drafted by respondents' counsel as an illustration and put in.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Was it admitted an evidence in some factual proceeding in the District Court?\nMr. Bork: No.\nI think it was just admitted, I do not think it is been there, I do not think any testimony taken about how this was drawn\nor the lines or anything else, but let me make a point about it.\nIf one looks at this rather large area with two close together dots for housing areas here, right below the City of Chicago,\nthat is the Robbins, that is the town of Robbins.\nNow, that looks like somebody has placed housing in the middle of a black area and maybe that is supposed to be\nsegregatory.\nIt is worth noting that the town of Robbins itself is 98.1% black and that this census tract, upon which that public\nhousing is located is 94.4% black.\nSo there is no way for the town of Robbins to put up any public housing that is not in a black area.\nSo that does not show segregation.\n\nJustice Potter Stewart: Does Robbins have its own Housing Authority?\nMr. Bork: Well, it has its own government, I do not know if it has a Housing Authority because many of these\ncommunities do not have Housing Authorities.\nIt has handled -- I do not know if Robbins has a Housing Authority or whether it operates thought its City Council.\nUnknown Speaker: (Inaudible)\nMr. Bork: That is right.\nI take it as no.\nDirectly below that one will see a black area with six black dots.\nThe three to the right, to the East are in the City of East Chicago Heights.\nThat city is 98.2% black and the public housing happens to be on the census tract which is 80% black.\nThere is again no possibility that any public housing could be put up in those two cities that was not in a black census\ntract.\nSo this map, if it showed it, does not even raise a prima-facie case of segregation in the suburbs.\nIf a de jure prima-facie case of segregation in the suburbs, it would certainly not show that there was any connection\nbetween what happened in Chicago and that -- I will take it back, I am told that the map is not Exhibit 11 it is just an\nexhibit in the brief, it is an attachment in the brief.\nMilliken against --\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: (Inaudible) aid, is that (Voice Overlap)?\nMr. Bork: Fairly so right.\nThe respondents offered it Mr. Chief Justice, and I guess it is offered as an indication of what they regard as prima-facie\nevidence.\nI do not think it is prima-facie evidence of anything.\nOur final submission is that Milliken against Bradley governs this case, the faults of one locality or being a -- made a\njurisdictional predicate for area wide social planning on communities that are in no way involved and I think Swann\nsuggest that judicial attempts to follow demographic shifts that are not due to any constitutional violation, really involves\nthe Court in doing little more than requiring racial balance as a constitutional mandate where no constitutional violation\nhas occurred.\nThank you.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: Mr. Polikoff.\nArgument of Alexander Polikoff\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.\nI wish to make two basic points this morning.\nThe first is, that a remedial order confined to HUD and extending throughout the HUD defined Chicago Housing Market\nArea is a practical option open to the District Judge.\nIt would be an appropriate order in this case and it would not be an Inter-district Order under Milliken and incidentally it\nwould not be an order that answers to the description that the Solicitor General gave you of the order that was entered\nby the Court of Appeals.\nI have a feeling that we are addressing two different cases here this morning.\nThe Solicitor Generalโs view of what is mandated by the Court of Appeals as I will show in a moment is not my view of\nwhat that Court has mandated or indeed of what would be proper under equitable principles the Solicitor General and I, I\nam sure share.\n\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: Would the power of exercise -- of imminent domain have to be exercised by someone to\nimplement this decree?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: It would have to be exercised Your Honor by private developers or by Local Housing Authorities\nand not by HUD.\nHUD has never exercised the power of imminent domain in the operation of these programs and the exercise of that\npower presents no problem, no obstacle in framing equitable relief here where a developer, public or private, has\nacquired land, it then applies to HUD for funds to promote a subsidized housing project on that land.\nIf it has not acquired the land, it never comes to HUD for the money in the first place.\nWe have never contended in this case and we do not contend now that the zoning power is at issue.\nThe decree which the Solicitor General suggests mandates a judicial supervision of the exercise of zoning powers by\nlocal communities is not the decree we envision and it is not in our opinion the decree compelled by the Court of\nAppeals Order in this case.\nI think the suggestion and it is one of many similar suggestions in the governmentโs brief and in the argument here this\nmorning that a parade of horrors will be the result of implementation of a Metropolitan Remedial Plan at the District Court\nlevel is simply inaccurate.\nAs our brief indicates, and we have cited cases and HUD regulations to this effect, subsidized housing is required to\ncomply with local zoning and other land use control regulations.An\nd nothing we have proposed in this case to date and nothing said by the Court of Appeals in our judgment changes that\nfact and the remand before the District Court, we would not propose anything different that I am saying here right now.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Mr. Polikoff, what and is you conceive the decree that would be required under the\nremand of the Court of Appeals?\nWhat effect would it have on the local authorities who were not previously parties to (Inaudible)?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: It might have none, Your Honor.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: But what so -- but might it have some?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: It might have an indirect impact and one of the problems is we cannot know because as my first\nof two points and I have not even told you yet what the second is, my first of two points was that an order might be\nconfined to HUD alone.\nIf the District Court in its judgment on remand did confine such an order to HUD alone, it would have no direct impact\nupon Local Housing Authorities.\nThey would not be decreedly (ph) involved, the order would not run against them at all.\nThey would only be indirectly involved in the following way.\nIf and when a Local Housing Authority voluntarily chose to apply for HUD subsidy funds in order to develop some\nhousing, a choice, I repeat for emphasis would be voluntarily made on its part, there would be no impact if it chose not\nto do so, it would then be subject to the conditions that HUD imposed on the use of federal funds offered to applying\nHousing Authorities.\nIn our view as indicated in the appendix to our brief, one conceivable remedial decree might be a direction to HUD to\nimpose two additional conditions on the use of Federal Funds in the Chicago Housing Market Area by those who apply\nfor such funds.\nThe first such condition, a condition essentially all ready contained in HUD regulations would be that housing be\npredominantly provided in the future in white rather than black neighborhoods because the history of the constitutional\nand statutory violation in this case is confining it to the black neighborhoods.\nThe second condition would be that a portion of the housing thus provided be made available to members of the plaintiff\nclass as a remedial measure.\nNow --\n\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: But how can you justify the imposition of that second condition as against outlying\nauthorities who have never had an opportunity to litigate any of these questions?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: We do not.\nWe do not suggest that the imposition of that condition should be imposed against persons who have not had an\nopportunity to litigate.\nThat was the inherent implication in your question of the Solicitor General and I would like to advise Your Honor that the\nSolicitor General was correct before the District Court, long before the Court reached the Court of Appeals, we did\nrequest the District Court to enter an order, I will call it a Milliken type order if you will, in which he determined that it\nwould be appropriate under the circumstances of the case to consider Housing Market Area Relief, but we said before\ndoing so, it would be necessary to add the Governmental Parties, not the local communities that the Solicitor General\ntalks about in the scores and in the hundreds because they do not provide housing, Robbins does not provide housing it\nis the Cook County Housing Authority which does, we suggest that before the District Court embarked on a\nconsideration of metropolitan relief and because of the dictates of Milliken, the appropriate affected party should be at it.\nWe suggested it to the District Court which parties we would suggest the adding, the state of Illinois and the housing\nauthorities in the Housing Market Area potentially to the affected.\nWe suggested that the District Court should direct HUD and CHA to indicate what additional parties if any ought to be at\nit and only at that stage we said to the District Court should you consider to -- should you proceed to consider a\nmetropolitan plan, indeed Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we submitted a proposed order in connection with that motion to the\nDistrict Court in which we specifically said, the Court is not now called upon to decide whether to order metropolitan\nrelief, but only that for the consideration of such relief that is appropriate to add these parties.\nThat motion was denied and --\nUnknown Speaker: Is that argument suggest that perhaps it is premature for us to grapple with the issues involved here?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: I think it does Your Honor and --\nUnknown Speaker: It is the same I gather is there is no order yet, none of us knows what the contours will be, none of\nus knows the impact on the outlying municipalities, indeed even the impact on HUD?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: That is exactly correct.\nIt is, Mr. Justice Blackmun, said speaking for the Court in the recent case of Wheeler versus Barrera, the case involving\nteaching in parochial schools by publicly paid teachers, the order before the Court in that case, it was a statute, but I\nam drawing an analogy, did not mandate on the premises parochial school instruction so that issue was not yet\npresented and that if on remand, Missouri and its State Agencies chose to up for that form of instruction.\nMr. Justice Blackman said, the range of possibilities was still very broad and the First Amendment implications of such\na plan would vary depending on what was adopted.\nUnknown Speaker: I mean, with our recent summary affirmance in the Delaware school, desegregation (Voice Overlap).\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: I am, Your Honor.\nUnknown Speaker: You recall there, it was proposed that the District Court consider a metropolitan remedy in the\nschool desegregation case.\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: That is correct.\nUnknown Speaker: But have not in fact entered a decree involving, providing a metropolitan remedy and we summarily\naffirmed, that was an appeal of course.\nDoes that (Voice Overlap).\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: I think that emphasizes the prematurity.\nIndeed the second point which I have not yet had the opportunity to tell Your Honors about was precisely this, that the\nissue of a remedial decree that embraced, if it did and we do not know whether it would or not, but that embraced local\nhousing authorities, is premature at this point because we do not have the shape of that decree before us, let alone\n\nknowing for sure that such a decree will be entered.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Yet do you not have to say that the Court of Appeals then too was premature in saying as\nit did that there should be a metropolitan remedy?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: I do Your Honor and I must say with deference to the Court of Appeals that I am not here\ndefending that opinion per se.\nA remand, I am defending the result.\nI think the result is sound, but I think the language is overly broad and this Court knows.\nA remand to the District Court would be in compliance with whatever this Court said in its opinion, not with what the\nCourt of Appeals said.\nI think that on remand, with the proper parties added, it would be open to the District Court in theory.\nI think it is very unlikely as a matter of fact for reasons I will come to.\nI think it would be open to the District Court in theory to decide against the metropolitan plan and I do not think without\nhaving joined the appropriate parties to be joined and having heard them, a final determination can be made with respect\nto that matter either.\nUnknown Speaker: In this respect is this not case and very much the same posture that the Milliken case was when it\ncame here?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Not at all Your Honor.\nThe Governmentโs brief, it is reply memorandum rather makes the flat out statement that this case is at the same stage\nthat Milliken was when this Court granted Certiorari.\nI differ with that view.\nThe District Court in Milliken, before this Court took the case, had entered a plan -- entered an order which provided for\nthe establishment of a panel of nine persons to formulate a desegregation plan and it had laid out a number of precise\nrespects in which that panel was to operate.\nIt talked about the equalization of facilities between school districts, the financial arrangements to be made between\nthem and a number of other particulars.\nAnd only after it was clear in Milliken, as a result of the entry of that order, even though the Court of Appeals sent it\nback in some particulars that essentially affirmed the District Court's basic approach in dealing with those matters and\ninvolving the Local District, then it came to this Court.\nUnknown Speaker: It was affirmed and approached though?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: It affirmed and approached, but with a clear indication that in -- it was a long Court of Appealsโ\nopinion Your Honor will recall, in a number of specifics that the District Court had indicated, that was the right way to go.\nNow, we do not have that here.\nWe do not have anything like that here.\nWe have not even heard at lower court levels let alone at this Court level from the parties who might be affected, and\ntherefore, it is not even clear Your Honor, and it was clear in Milliken, it is not even clear here, that the District Court\nwould enter an order that would involve local housing authorities at all.\nJustice Potter Stewart: You do not mean -- you mean out of Chicago?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Out of Chicago, it would not involve them at all.\nI wish --\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: But thatis what the Court of Appeals was talking about?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: The Court of Appeals was talking Your Honor, about the desirability on the record made in this\n\ncase of area wide, but not multi district relief.\nIn Milliken, this Court spoke not merely of area wide relief in a geographic sense, but of area wide multi district relief.\nThat is a quotation I believe from phrase that appears in Mr. Chief Justice Burgerโs opinion in Milliken and what that\nphrase meant in Milliken was that the relief envisioned by the lower court and the Court of Appeals in that case\nnecessarily involved, what Your Honor called included dtistricts.\nDecrees that ran -- a decree that ran against local Governmental entities, discreet autonomous units and required them\nto do something they were decreedal parties.\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals' direction to be metropolitan area wide in scope need not involve the decreedal\nprovisions that require the inclusion of additional parties.\nMy very first point, in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's early question, was it one invisionable, there is such a word,\none invisionable form of relief in this case is a decree confined to HUD that does not decreedly run against anybody else\nthat tells HUD to utilize what it already utilizes administratively, a housing market area unit for administering the stream\nof Federal Subsidy Funds flowing into the Chicago area that is in the past caused discrimination and in the future ought\nto be used to remedy it.\nNow, that flow of Federal Funds, HUD administers on an area wide basis, not an area wide multi-district basis as in\nMilliken, but an area wide basis, it compares competing proposals for the use of those funds that come to it from within\nthat area.\nNow, why does it choose such an area?\nIt does so because HUDโs regulations say that in the real world, housing is not like schools.\nChildren are assigned to schools within a discreet geographic area and they have to go there, they cannot go anywhere\nelse if they live within that area.\nHUD says that by contrast in the housing situation, people look for housing in terms of how far they are from jobs,\ncommuting distances, what the market for housing is as determined by HUD to be a specific geographic area that\ncrosses the boundary lines of local political jurisdiction.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: But even if those housing authorities are not as you say, decreedly involved, if HUD is to\nbe enjoined by the Court to treat them in a manner otherwise, then it would voluntarily treat them, ought they not to have\nhad an opportunity to be heard on that question?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: We insist that they should and I have been agreeing with you Mr. Justice Rehnquist is that\nshould have been the procedure followed.\nIt was the procedure we requested the District Court to follow.\nIt was aborted because the District Court denied our motion to that effect.\nAnd indeed, the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals was an appeal not from the entire judgment order entered by\nthe District Court, but only from that portion of the order that denied the motion you and I have just been talking about.\nThe rest of the judgment order was the general summary judgment against HUD.\nWe did not appeal from that.\nHUD filed a cross appeal from that portion of the order and later abandoned it and rightly so because it was the order\nthey themselves had proposed.\nThe second aspect of your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist implied as I understood it that there might be something\ninequitable even about an indirect involvement of the local housing authorities since they were not involved in the wrong, I\nam assuming for this purpose that the wrong is viewed as being limited to Chicago, we make that is not so also.\nThe cases cited in our brief show that in the administration of Federal programs, Federal Courts have a number of times\nin food stamp cases and employments services cases confined relief to the Federal Administering Agency in connection\nwith the joint Federally, Locally Administered program.\nThe Courts have said that is proper.\n\nThe indirect impact on the State is something that is mandated by Federal Law, but even beyond that, the major current\nform of federally subsidized housing activities does not necessarily involve Local Housing Authorities at all.\nHUDโs current program is primarily a private developer program, not a local housing authority program.\nHUDโs dealings are primarily with private developers and with respect of that kind of flow of federally subsidized\nactivities, the local jurisdictional boundary lines are completely irrelevant.\nHousing authorities may, but need not enter into the program.\nIt is a matter of their own voluntary choice.\nIn sum, there are two alternatives it seems to me.\nOne is to dismiss the writ that is improvidently granted because the whole thing appears premature.\nJustice Harry A. Blackmun: That if I might suggest that is what you have just said to us, you do not agree that the -- you\ndo think that the opinion at least sweeps over broadly?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Correct.\nI do.\nJustice Harry A. Blackmun: So a dismissal leaving that stand probably would not be (Inaudible).\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: The second alternative and in my view by far the preferable one because this has been a long\nlasting litigation and clarity is desirable.\nThe second would be to recognize the force as I see it and I hope you do if I point number 1 that on any view giving the\nmost weight and strength to the Milliken considerations on any view, a decree limited to HUD not running against the\nLocal Housing Authorities or other Governmental Entities would be an appropriate order in this case and would not be\ninter-district under Milliken.\nNow, on that view the Court of Appeals judgment, not its opinion of course, but the Court of Appeals judgment could be\naffirmed because all that judgment does is --\nJustice Harry A. Blackmun: Was the limitation that you just suggested --\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: With limitation that I -- well, what I am suggesting is a limitation as to an appropriate order that\nmight be entered by the District Court, but the District Court would not be confined to that.\nThe other possibilities in light of the procedural corrections that Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I have been talking about\nhaving been made, the District Court could then consider whether or not and I am not predicting, whether or not relief\nextending beyond HUD would be appropriate.\nJustice Harry A. Blackmun: Do you rather, more like a modification of the remand of the Court of Appeals and District\nCourt and does an affirmance as to both.\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: I agree with that Your Honor.\nJustice Potter Stewart: It is an affirmance in that you think we ought to agree that the case ought to be remanded to the\nDistrict Court.\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Yes.\nThat is correct.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: (Inaudible)\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Pardon me?\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: You want the District Court to hold the hearing, you do not want just issue an order?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: That is correct.\nWe think that the next step and indeed what we asked for in our motion below that was denied was the holding hearing.\n\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: You said as I understand it, that when it came to the District Court, the District Court\ncan say, would be free to say if he is so concluded that under Milliken he could not go beyond the boundaries of\nChicago?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: The District Court would not in our judgment be free to say that soundly and correctly because\nas I have indicated it is my first and principal point here Mr. Chief Justice Burger, that an order confined to HUD, even\nthough it extended area wide to the housing market area, but did not involve other parties would not be an inter-district\norder under Milliken.\nThe --\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: What kind of an order would go to HUD to say exercise your -- to the Secretary,\nexercise your discretion according to the following guidelines?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Not quite that way.\nWe have an order in Chicago Your Honor, to illustrate and I am not -- I am answering your question in terms of what\nDistrict Court might do, what one of the options would be, we have an order in Chicago that essentially imposes two\nrequirements on HUD.\nIt says that the Federal Housing Subsidy Funds, henceforth flowing into Chicago should meet two criterion if they are to\nbe used in Chicago, in addition to all of the other criterion and those two criteria are first the predominance in white\nresident black neighborhoods and second, availability of some of the housing to the plaintiff class.\nNow, to answer your question Mr. Chief Justice Burger, exactly those two criterion could be directed by the District\nCourt to be used by HUD in the area HUD already uses to administer these programs that would not involve other\nparties, that would not in our view, therefore, be an inter-district order under Milliken and the District Court would not,\ntherefore, be prohibited by Milliken from entering such an area wide order against HUD.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: But that is the authority of the District, the Federal District Judge to tell the Executive\nBranch how to exercise its discretion?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: The authority, I would say the duty stems from the adjudication of liability against HUD.\nThe Federal Executive Branch is obligated to remedy its constitutional and statutory wrongs just as much as State and\nLocal Governments are and cases without number have imposed restrictions and limitations on Federal Agencies\nrequiring them to remedy their own wrongs.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: (Inaudible) identify here when you referred to that the --\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: The Solicitor General emphasizes and properly so that HUDโs wrong was in a sense secondary\nbecause it consisted of funding and approving actions of another agency, but we insist and I think also correctly so that\nthe Court of Appeals was right in finding that HUDโs activities, although understandable were nonetheless an\nindependent basis of wrongdoing and violated both the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: All of that relate simply to the Chicago Housing Authority as I understand it.\nIt is not just that the Local Authorities have not had an opportunity to litigate factually in the District Court their activities\nin the area outside of Chicago, but I gather has been no factual hearing on HUDโs activities outside of the Chicago\nhousing authority area?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: That is correct Your Honor.\nIn our view housing market areas or relief against HUD would not be dependent upon such a factual hearing because the\nChicago, the City of Chicago is located within the Chicago Housing Market Area, an administrative area that HUD\ndefines and uses as the appropriate area for a number of purposes, particularly and specifically including and I am now\nquoting from a HUD regulation โdecreasing the effects of past housing discrimination.โ\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: But your theory in the District Court that was upheld by the Court of Appeals on the first\nappeal was that HUDโs violations had been secondary as a result of pressure from Chicago Alderman.\nNow, it seems to me that when you get outside of the City of Chicago, you would have to make some sort of a new\nshowing that this, that HUD had engaged in similar violations and the fact that it responded to pressures from Chicago\nAlderman would not necessarily mean than Joliet Alderman or Elgin Alderman would have put the same pressures on\n\nthe HUD?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: I think not.\nIt is important to distinguish between what is necessary to demonstrate at the liability stage of the case and what is\nappropriate for an equity Court to consider at the remedial stage of a case.\nIf we assume for the moment and I am not arguing here, I am certainly not waiving and I will come to it shortly if there is\ntime, but if we assume of this suburban discrimination aspect of the case, but if we assume for a moment that the\nwrongs were confined to the City of Chicago, nonetheless residents of the City of Chicago seek housing as HUD itself\nsays, not within the boundaries of the City of Chicago, but within the housing market area.\nThey seek it throughout that entire area.\nHUD constantly administers its programs with respect to that broader area.\nNow, liability having been established on the part of HUD admittedly by assumption for our purposes here at the moment\nwithin the City of Chicago, it is incumbent upon HUD and it is incumbent by an equity Court to direct HUD to provide the\nfullest possible, the most effective relief that may be attainable with respect to the wrongs it has committed in Chicago.\nNow, why implied in your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist, should HUD in doing that go beyond the City of Chicagoโs\ncorporate boundary limits.\nWell, the answer is, unlike the situations with schools, housing is sought by the persons in Chicago, including the\nwrong persons within the housing market area.\nIt is, therefore, possible for HUD to provide relief for those persons in accordance with its normal administrative activities\nas indicated by its own regulations in what is a realistic geographic area with respect to housing.\nIt would not be with respect to schools.\nIt is true that the nature of the wrong determines the scope of the remedy, but the nature of the wrong in this case is not\na schoolโs wrong, it is the housing wrong and the nature of the universe of housing is that we deal with market areas, we\ndo not deal with identifiable and confined geographic units called school districts and the nature of the housing wrong in\nthis case not only justifies, but compels the equitable relief of using the housing market area as the remedial geography.\nJustice Potter Stewart: The school districts are geographic units, they were politically units?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: Both, that is correct Your Honor.\nJustice Potter Stewart: And here to you have political units?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: And the political unit that is relevant with respect to HUD is of course the entity, the Department\nof Housing and Urban Development, which has chosen an administrative area that expands beyond the boundaries of\nthe Local Housing Authorities who may not even be participants at all in a part of the remedial scheme we are talking\nabout.\nOne of the anomaly --\nJustice Potter Stewart: In Milliken, you have the State of Michigan with an overall regional educational policy and\npowers?\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: That is correct.\nNot being exercised, it had a potential for late in power to compel the consolidation of local school districts in that case.\nHere we do not have a potential or late empower on the part of HUD to compel anybody to do anything.\nWe are not talking about compelling.\nWe are talking about an order confined to HUD.\nThat is a practical option to the District Court that would not compel anybody other than HUD to do anything.\nThere would of course be indirect impacts on housing developers, private developers, as well as public developers who\nchose voluntarily to apply for the housing, but those indirect impacts are no ground for refusing or denying the relief\n\nagainst HUD that plaintiffs are entitled to as a remedial matter.\nI guess my time has expired.\nThank you.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: Mr. Solicitor General.\nRebuttal of Bork\nMr. Bork: Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.\nLet me address the question of the remand because I think that would be totally improper in this case.\nA remand would send this case back under respondents' counsel theory to consider a metropolitan wide relief which we\nthink can be shown now and we think we have shown now as a matter of law to be improper.\nSecondly, in answer the question by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think it would do no good Mr. Justice Rehnquist to bring in\nlocal communities for a hearing about a remedy.\nThey might be heard about a remedy, they might prevail, or they might be overridden, but they are being subjected to\nhearings and a possible remedy when they have committed no violation.\nJustice William H. Rehnquist: Well, my question suggest is not a hearing about a remedy, but a question about whether\nthere had been an initial wrong and then presumably if a finding of a wrong?\nMr. Bork: I quite agree in that case if the respondents' counsel wants to file a new case or amend this case and start a\nnew lawsuit about an inter-district violation of the fact, of course.\nNow, if we talk about ordering HUD alone and this not being inter-district as to HUD as a somatic game, it really ought\nto go on unchallenged.\nThe truth is, as I stressed in my opening statement, there would be an enormous practical impact on innocent\ncommunities who have to bear the burden of this housing.\nWe will have to house a plaintiff class from Chicago which they wronged in no way, who is -- political processes which\nare respected by Congress will be overridden and there is no way that is not an inter-district remedy even though you\nused HUD as the conduit.\nIt is very dangerous to say that anytime a Federal Agency does anything wrong in any locality because the Federal\nAgency has jurisdiction over a very wide area, the Federal Agency can be asked to sweep in the residents of that entire\narea, although they were not involved in any wrongdoing and in any shape or form.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: As I understand the position would that the Court might not issue any decree at all?\nMr. Bork: The Court might not.\nI think Mr. Justice Marshall if the District Court were not to issue any metropolitan decree, it could only be because this\nCourt vastly modified what that Court of Appeals said because that was a direction.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: (Inaudible) would be modified.\nSecondly as I understand what they are saying is not been HUD makes any County or District or anything do anything,\nbut that HUD studies it?\nMr. Bork: Oh.\nHUD does study Mr. Justice Marshall.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: But what they are asking for and to see whether or not there is not some relief that HUD\ncould give.(Voice Overlap)\nMr. Bork: Well that is a different --\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: Not that HUD must do it?\nMr. Bork: I think it is a different lawsuit Mr. Justice Marshall.\n\nIf the question were, is HUD adequately exercising its discretion under its statute that would be a totally different\nstatute, a lawsuit.\nThis is not that lawsuit.\nThis is a Constitutional violation in Chicago with no allegation that HUD is acting improperly anywhere else, but HUD is\nto be used because of its wide jurisdiction as a conduit to take the Chicago violation out and bring somebody else in for\na remedy.\nNow, on a remand, I think it is improper because HUD is going to have to litigate something that I think is improper to\nbegin with.\nThese communities are going to be required to litigate it.\nWe have got 11 housing authorities in there who are not even alleged to have done anything wrong.\nSo that a remand, I think would be quite wrong.\nHUD wide-spread jurisdiction was not intended to wipe out the Local Political Units that are supposed to make these\ndecisions for their community.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: (Inaudible) HUD consider it as a region and wipe out the line and reconsider it?\nMr. Bork: No sir, Mr. Justice Marshall, it does not wipe out the lines.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: You mean that HUD does not look at five, six or more counties around in the city?\nMr. Bork: HUD may do that.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall: And look at it as a unit without regard to district lines?\nMr. Bork: HUD looks at it for planning purposes, but when it is finished planning, it does not implement a plan which is\ninconsistent with the Local Communities Housing Assistance Plan for example.\nThe local community participates politically in this and has a number of checks upon this.\nSo, but what is obviously inevitable here is that in some form that local autonomy is going to be overridden or bypassed\nand we are going to wind up with effective remedies in towns that have done nothing wrong.\nJustice Byron R. White: Do you think that HUD would generally say -- could cooperating in unconstitutional sites\nselection, was it not your trouble area?\nMr. Bork: No.\nThe order against HUD entered by the District Court Mr. Justice White was a best-efforts order and HUD is cooperating\nin the Chicago area, and will use its best efforts --\nJustice Byron R. White: Well, I know but that is -- I will ask you again, what about that injunction applied to the Chicago\nhousing area as a (Voice Overlap).\nMr. Bork: Oh the area, I am sorry, I am sorry.\nAnd --\nJustice Byron R. White: It is just not the kind of an order?\nMr. Bork: A best-efforts order.\nJustice Byron R. White: Yes.\nIn the entire area just do not cooperate in anymore, whatever you are found guilty of -- HUD is found guilty then in\nChicago, you ought to split it and split it in the Chicago Housing Area?\nMr. Bork: I do not see the legal predicate for an order against HUD in the Chicago housing area anymore because it did\nsomething wrong in Chicago.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: (Inaudible) I suppose something that is not in the record in this case that is, that is\n\nsomeone is beating his wife, and therefore, stop beating your wife?\nRebuttal of Alexander Polikoff\nMr. Alexander Polikoff: I think I would Mr. Chief Justice, in fact I think that to be consistent --\nJustice Byron R. White: (Inaudible) apparently you do not challenge the -- at least here this is lawsuit and the\nconstitutional violation by HUD in Chicago.\nYou do not mind being ordered to stop that in Chicago?\nRebuttal of Bork\nMr. Bork: That is quite correct Mr. Justice White.\nHowever, I would certainly would object --\nJustice Byron R. White: You do not mind being ordered to stop violating the constitution in the Chicago housing area?\nMr. Bork: HUD is not being shown to and does not, to the best of my knowledge to violate the Constitution in anyway in\nthe Chicago Housing Area and it is not doing it in the City of Chicago.\nJustice Byron R. White: (Voice Overlap) you do object to it?\nMr. Bork: I certainly do Mr. Justice White and let me explain why.\nI would object to it if the request for relief in this case were HUD is been found to acquiesce in the acts of the Chicago\nHousing Authority, and therefore, we are going to order HUD to stop it in New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, and San\nDiego.\nHUD has not done anything like that and I think it ought not to be subjective to an order which is an equivalent of that.\nJustice Byron R. White: (Inaudible) who are operating in the Chicago Housing Area, that operate inside Chicago, then\nwe do have an issue post and I guess that is what the lawsuit is all about?\nMr. Bork: I must Mr. Justice White there has been no showing of a predisposition on the part on the part of HUD to this.\nIn fact, all of the Courts agreed that HUD opposed what was happening in Chicago, made some progress and in\nopposing it, but ultimately acquiesced and financed things they should not have because of the desperate need for\nhousing and plaintiffsโ affidavits about the kind of housing they were living in before HUD put up this public housing in\nChicago illustrates that desperate need for public housing that existed at that time.\nJustice Byron R. White: What was the basis for the Court of Appeals (Voice Overlap) remarks that at least had initially\nthought that a District Right remedy -- a metropolitan remedy was appropriate?\nMr. Bork: Well, HUD does think that it ought to work as its statutory mandate requires throughout the metropolitan area.\nIt does not think it ought to be subject to a Court order which is going to change its statutory mandate throughout that\narea when it has done nothing wrong in that area.\nJustice Byron R. White: Do you think the Court of Appeals misread whatever it was that HUD represented --\nMr. Bork: I think the Court of Appeals did, Mr. Justice White and I think respondents' counsel too.\nHUD keeps saying that it is important to work in the metropolitan area and that it will do so as its statute allows and the\nstatute allows that, encourages that, but it does place limitations and there is no reason to destroy those limitations\nwhen nothing is wrong has been done at that area.\nChief Justice Warren E. Burger: Thank you gentlemen.\nThe case is submitted.",

First, as  Dr.  Baron's Affidavit  dis-\ncloses,  the  188,000  White families  eligible  for  public  housing \nhave  understandably  chosen  in  the  main  to  forego  their  op-\nportunity to obtain low cost housing rather than to move  into \nall Negro projects in all Negro neighborhoods.  This is an ironic \nbut predictable result of  a  segregationist policy of  protecting \nWhites from  less  than  half  as  many  (76,000)  eligible  Negro \nfamilies.  Second,  existing  patterns  of  racial  separation  must \nbe revers-ed if there is to be a chance of averting the dmsperately \nintensifying division of Whites and Negroes in Chicago.  On the \nbasis of present trends of Negro residential concentration and \nof Negro migration into and White migration out of the central \ncity,  the President's  Commission  on  Civil  Disorders  estimates \nthat Chicago will become 50% Negro by 1984.
