Plaintiffs' letter motion to compel and for sanctions regarding information from Defendants' personal cell phones is DENIED. The arrests at issue were made in 2014. This case was filed in 2017. Plaintiffs provide no basis to believe that any of the 59 officers' personal cell phones have had or would be likely to have had information relevant to the events in this case. Rather, Plaintiffs speculate that the officers may have used their cell phones in connection with official business or while off duty. Plaintiffs selectively quote from a Port Authority Operations Order that says, \"A cellular phone can be a useful alternative for conducting official business, when conveying information that would be inappropriate to transmit over a Department radio.\" But the immediately preceding sentence makes clear that cellular phones generally are not to be used, stating that \"cellular phones are not a substitute for the use of Department radios and members are required to use Department radios for communications in the field, whenever possible.\" If Plaintiffs obtain information in discovery - such as through interrogatories or deposition testimony - that Defendants actually used their personal cell phones in connection with the arrests and events in this case, then Plaintiffs may have a basis to renew their request. But at this juncture, the request for cell phone data is not proportional to the needs of the case. (Signed by Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger on 2/26/2018) (mml) (Entered: 02/26/2018)"

The letter will be printed on the Court's stationery and sealed m envelopes indicating it is from the Court. 5. The Port Authority will provide to the Court mailing labels with the names and addresses from all of the arrest records previously produced to Plaintiffs. The Port Authority will also provide to the Court a list of the arrest numbers and the corresponding name and address that appear on the arrest files. This list will be provided to Plaintiffs with the names and addresses redacted. 6. The letter will include an agreed-upon form letter, attached hereto as Exhibit B, allowing arrestees to provide their contact information and indicate whether they would like to be contacted by Plaintiffs' counsel and further whether they consent to releasing their sealed arrest records to Plaintiffs' counsel. 7. Plaintiffs will provide a pre-addressed and stamped envelope to be mailed with the letter for interested individuals to send to Plaintiffs' counsel if they choose within 30 days of receipt of letter. 8. The letter will be presented to the Court for mailing to the addressees. 9.

Within three business of receiving from Plaintiffs' counsel copies of any responsive forms received from interested individuals, Defendants' counsel must advise Plaintiffs' counsel whether there is any dispute that there has been a clear waiver of the individual's rights with respect to either the permission to contact the individual or the release of that individual's unredacted arrest records. 11. If three business days have passed and Defendants have not advised Plaintiffs' counsel of any disputes with respect to the adequacy of any waiver by a specific individual, Plaintiffs' counsel may contact said individuals. 12. If, within three business days, Defendants advise Plaintiffs' counsel that they have a good faith belief that any response did not constitute a clear waiver of the arrestee's rights, this dispute will immediately be submitted to the Court by Plaintiffs' counsel for resolution. 13. If there is no dispute, or once any dispute has been resolved by the Court, and it has been determined that there has been a waiver, Plaintiffs' counsel may contact said individual and Defendants will provide Plaintiffs' counsel with an unredacted copy of that individual's arrest file. 14.

The parties must meet and confer on this issue and bring any remaining issue to the Court's attention (although the Court encourages the parties to avoid the necessity for that) no later than January 24, 2019. Plaintiffs shall respond to Defendant's last-minute interrogatories and document requests. Defendants are cautioned about any further delays, for which they may be subject to sanctions. It should not take a party's having to write to the Court to get the other party's attention. Any other remaining, currently outstanding discovery obligations. SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "<p>On March 27, 2017, two men sued the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority), Port Authority Police Department (Department), and Department officers alleging discriminatory false arrests in Port Authority Bus Terminal (Bus Terminal) bathrooms. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants falsely arrested the plaintiffs and other men in Bus Terminal bathrooms because the police perceived them to be gay or gender nonconforming. The complaint alleged that these arrests violated the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and sought relief under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The plaintiffs sought to certify the suit as a class action, with the class composed of all men arrested in Bus Terminal bathrooms based on being perceived as gay or gender nonconforming; they asked for declaratory relief, a permanent injunction banning the discriminatory arrests, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs amended their complaint twice, first on October 6, 2017, and then on November 28, 2018. The amended complaints added two additional individual plaintiffs and named additional officer-defendants. The amended complaints also separated the two causes of actions, suing the officers for directly violating their constitutional rights, and suing the Port Authority and Department based on a failure to train or supervise theory. Between the first and seconded amended complaints, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved to certify the class on June 14, 2019, but the court denied that motion on February 26, 2020. On March 29, 2020, the defendants moved for partial summary judgment, which the court granted in part and denied in part on February 22, 2021. The court denied the officers qualified immunity, holding that the alleged wrongful acts violated clearly established law. The court dismissed the claims against officer-defendants who had not actually made any arrests as time barred and as failing to state a claim. The court also dismissed the plaintiffs' Due Process Clause claim, holding that the plaintiffs failed to state a Due Process Clause violation. Finally, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages against the Port Authority and Department, holding that municipalities are not liable for punitive damages under &sect; 1983. 521 F.Supp.3d 415</p>\r\n<p>On May 31, 2022, the parties reached a settlement. The defendants did not admit to wrongdoing but agreed to provide at least four hours of mandatory LGBTQ+ sensitivity training to incoming Department recruits and to post rights-informational signage in bathrooms. The defendants also agreed to read instructional memorandums about discrimination and boilerplate language in police reports at all shifts over 24 hour period and created a new position to serve as a liaison with the LGBTQ+ community. And the defendants made separate payments of $15,000 and $25,000 to the individual defendants. The court dismissed the case on June 1, 2022, conditional on the defendants complying with the settlement agreement within three months.</p>",

KOELTL, District Judge: \nThe plaintiffs, Cornell Holden and Miguel Mejia, have \nbrought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the \nPort Authority of New York and New Jersey (the “Port \nAuthority”), the Port Authority Police Department (the “PAPD”), \nand Michael Opromalla, Shaun Kehoe, John Tone, Jordan Esposito, \nMichael DeMartino, Richard Aylmer, Paul Miller, John \nFitzpatrick, and Paul O’Dell (collectively, the “Officer \nDefendants”), in their individual and official capacities, as \nofficers of the PAPD, for alleged violations of the plaintiffs’ \nrights guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs have \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 2 of 48\nalleged (1) false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, \n(2) impermissible discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation or gender non-conformity in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and (3) \ninfringement of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In addition, the plaintiffs \nhave sought punitive damages. The plaintiffs allege that the \nOfficer Defendants targeted them, or failed to supervise \narresting officers who targeted them, for unlawful search, \nseizure, and false arrest without probable cause, based on the \nimpermissible consideration of their perceived sexual \norientation or gender non-conforming presentation.  Further, the \nplaintiffs claim that the Port Authority engaged in and \nperpetuated a de facto custom or policy of failing to supervise, \ntrain, or discipline officers assigned to plainclothes \npatrolling of the Port Authority Bus Terminal (the “PABT”) men’s \nbathrooms, resulting in the targeting of men perceived to be gay \nor bisexual, men who have sex with men, or who are otherwise \ngender non-conforming, for unlawful searches, seizures, false \narrests without probable cause.  \nThe defendants have moved for partial summary judgment on \n(1) all claims against the Port Authority, (2) all claims \nagainst the non-arresting Officer Defendants, namely, Kehoe, \nEsposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, O’Dell, and Fitzpatrick, \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 3 of 48\nand (3) all claims based on alleged violations of the \nplaintiffs’ rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nEqual Protection Clause and Due Process Clause. The defendants \nalso argue that the plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages \nagainst the Port Authority should be dismissed.1  \nFor the reasons that follow, the defendants’ motion is \ngranted with respect to the plaintiffs’ claims against non-\narresting Officer Defendants, claims based on the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process Clause, and request for punitive damages \nagainst the Port Authority, and denied in all other respects.  \nI. \nThe following facts are taken from the Second Amended \nComplaint, declarations and exhibits filed in connection with \nthe motions, and the parties’ Local Rule 56.1 statements, and \nare undisputed unless otherwise noted. \nA. \nThe defendant Port Authority is a bi-state government \nagency, created by a compact between, and authorized under the \nlaws of, the States of New York and New Jersey. Defs.’ 56.1 \nStmt. ¶¶ 1-2. The Port Authority is authorized to maintain a \nPublic Safety Department, the PAPD, that employs officers with \nstatewide jurisdiction in New York. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 3.  The \n \n1  The defendants have not moved for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ \nclaims against Officers Opromalla and Tone for false arrest in violation of \nthe plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 4 of 48\nPort Authority owns and operates the PABT at 625 Eighth Avenue \nin New York, New York, which is patrolled by PAPD officers. \nDefs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 4.  The individual Officer Defendants were \nofficers and employees of the PAPD during the relevant period at \nissue.   \nThe plaintiffs Cornell Holden and Miguel Mejia were \narrested after using the men’s restroom on the second floor of \nthe PABT in 2014.   \nHolden was arrested on May 12, 2014 around 9 a.m., shortly \nafter he exited the second floor PABT men’s restroom.  Defs.’ \n56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 21-22.  Holden is a black male who was 27 years \nold, lived in the Bronx, and worked in Long Island City at the \ntime of the arrest. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 24; Declaration of \nThomas Brophy, ECF No. 228, (“Brophy Decl.”), Ex. M, at 81. \nHolden, who works as a baker, testified that on the morning of \nMay 12, he was passing through the PABT on his way to a cake \nshop in Manhattan. Declaration of Seth Spitzer, ECF No. 232 \n(“Spitzer Decl.”), Ex. 15, at 123; Ex. 20, at 3. Holden \ntestified that he had entered the PABT men’s bathroom, gone to \nthe only vacant urinal, and that while at the urinal, he noticed \na bald, Caucasian male wearing “regular clothing,” later \nidentified as Officer Opromalla in plain clothes, standing at \nthe adjacent urinal. Brophy Decl. Ex. M, at 127, 135, 150. \nHolden testified that as he was finishing at the urinal, Officer \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 5 of 48\nOpromalla “stepped back and looked past the divider” at Holden \nand then exited the bathroom. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 136.  \nHolden reported that after he finished using the urinal, he \nrealized that he was having a nosebleed, and remained in the \nbathroom until the bleeding stopped. Id. at 137. After Holden \nleft the bathroom, he was approached by two plainclothes \nofficers, defendants Opromalla and Kehoe, who, according to \nHolden’s testimony, asked him if he got “the wrong impression \nabout anyone in the bathroom” and about “what happened in the \nbathroom.” Id. at 143-44. Holden was then placed under arrest, \nand when he asked for an explanation, the officers told him that \nhe was “seen doing a lewd act in the bathroom.” Id. at 146.  \nOfficer Opromalla, who had identified Holden as having committed \na lewd act, later told Holden that he was “standing by the \nurinal . . . erect” and that he “kn[e]w what he did.” Spitzer \nDecl. Ex. 15, at 150-151.  \nHolden testified that, while in PABT custody, he overheard \ncertain PAPD officers congratulate Officer Opromalla on the \narrest and heard a male PAPD officer joke about Officer \nOpromalla “having a date . . . tonight” and describe Officer \nOpromalla as a “gay whisperer,” which Holden understood as a \nreference to Officer Opromalla’s ability to “catch” gay men. Id. \nat 156-59. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 6 of 48\nThe parties dispute the degree of involvement of Officer \nKehoe in Holden’s arrest, but the parties agree that Officer \nOpromalla prepared the arrest paperwork and Officer Opromalla is \nlisted as the “Arresting Officer” on Holden’s Criminal Complaint \nArrest Report (“CCR”). Spitzer Decl. Ex. 17; Brophy Decl. Ex. C, \n207-11; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 4, at 210-13. It similarly appears \nundisputed that Officer Kehoe was outside of the bathroom at the \ntime that Officer Opromalla reported observing Holden’s \nbehavior. Brophy Decl. Ex. C, at 205-06; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. \n¶¶ 29, 33. Holden’s CCR, prepared by Officer Opromalla, stated \nthat Opromalla “observed the defendant . . . expose his naked \nerect penis at the urinal and manipulate it in a back and forth \nmotion in full public view.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 17, at PA 000018. \nThe parties agree that Lt. O’Dell, Sgt. Miller, Sgt. DeMartino, \nand Sgt. Esposito were not present at Holden’s arrest, but \nsigned Holden’s post-arrest paperwork. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 40-\n43; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 40-43.   \nIt is undisputed that Officer Opromalla did not make \nexplicit reference to Holden’s sexuality during the arrest. \nDefs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 45; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶ 45. \nNevertheless, Holden, who identifies as a gay male, Defs.’ 56.1 \nStmt. ¶ 27; Brophy Decl. Ex. C; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 73, \ntestified that he believed that it was clear from his appearance \nthat he was gay. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 170. Holden testified \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 7 of 48\nhe had his hair in a mohawk and that he was wearing fitted denim \npants, a black leather jacket, silver hoop earrings, a silver \nchain necklace, a silver name ring, a beaded bracelet, high-top \nsneakers, and a duffle bag with a Fred Perry logo. Spitzer Decl. \nEx. 15, at 98-104, 170; Brophy Decl. Ex. M, at 98-106, 170. The \ncharges against Holden were ultimately dismissed on December 9, \n2014. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 41-42. \nMejia was arrested on July 9, 2014 at approximately 5:06 \np.m., shortly after leaving the same PABT men’s bathroom. Mejia \nis a white Hispanic male, who was 43 years old, living in \nManhattan and employed at the Family Help Living Center at the \ntime of his arrest in 2014. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 54-55; Brophy \nDecl. Ex. P, at 12, 16-18.  He was at the PABT in order to take \na 5:12 p.m. bus to Clifton, New Jersey. Pls.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 57. \nMejia testified that when he entered the PABT men’s restroom, he \nwent to the only vacant urinal. Id. at ¶ 63; Brophy Decl. Ex. P, \nat 124-25.  \nThere are several discrepancies between the parties’ \naccounts of the events leading up to Mejia’s arrest. Mejia \ntestified that while he was using the urinal, he noticed a \n“short” man to his right, who “smirked” at Mejia when Mejia \nlooked at him. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 16, at 126-27, 156-57. Officer \nTone testified that he entered the bathroom, in plain clothes, \nand while standing by the sinks, he noticed that Mejia was \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 8 of 48\nlooking at the man to his right, that Mejia “turned his body” \ntowards the man, and that he saw Mejia’s arm moving “rapidly.” \nDeclaration of Thomas Brophy, ECF No. 236 (“Brophy Reply \nDecl.”), Ex. T, at 118, 127, 133.  Officer Tone reported that he \n“took a few steps” towards Mejia “where [he] was able to see the \n[alleged] criminal act.” Brophy Decl. Ex. F, at 133. Officer \nTone reported he was not aware if the other man saw Mejia’s \npenis. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 6, at 139-40. The parties appear to \nagree that Officer Kehoe had remained outside of the bathroom, \nalso in plain clothes. Brophy Decl. Ex. D, at 21-24; Ex. F, at \n117; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶ 60. \nThe parties agree that Mejia was arrested by Officer Tone, \nwith the assistance of Officer Kehoe, after Mejia left the men’s \nbathroom.

Ex. \n4, at 293. Capitan Fitzpatrick stated that it “was suggested \nmaybe to take Opromalla out of plainclothes.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. \n9, at 105.  Captain Fitzpatrick testified that, to the degree he \nremembers anything about his response to the New York Times \narticle, it was instructing Officers: “If you see probabl[e] \ncause for arrest, no matter what it is, make the arrest.” Id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 17 of 48\nII.  \nThe standard to be applied to a motion for summary judgment \nis well-established.  Courts are instructed to grant a motion \nfor “summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); \nsee also Celotex Corp. v. Cartrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).3 \n“[T]he trial court's task at the summary judgment motion stage \nof the litigation is carefully limited to discerning whether \nthere are any genuine issues of material fact to be tried, not \nto deciding them.” Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. \nP’ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir. 1994). The Court’s “duty, in \nshort, is confined at this point to issue-finding,” and “does \nnot extend to issue-resolution.” Id.  \nThe moving party bears the initial burden of “informing the \ndistrict court of the basis for its motion” and identifying the \nmatter that “it believes demonstrate[s] the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact.” Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The \nsubstantive law governing the case will identify those facts \nthat are material and “[o]nly disputes over facts that might \naffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will \n \n3 \nUnless otherwise noted, this Opinion and Order omits all alterations, \n \nomissions, emphasis, quotation marks, and citations in quoted text.\n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 18 of 48\nproperly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nIn determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, a \ncourt must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable \ninferences against the moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. \nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). “Summary \njudgment should be denied if, when the party against whom \nsummary judgment is sought is given the benefit of all \npermissible inferences and all credibility assessments, a \nrational factfinder could resolve all material factual issues in \nfavor of that party.” Soto v. Gaudett, 862 F.3d 148, 157 (2d \nCir. 2017). If the moving party meets its burden, the nonmoving \nparty must produce evidence in the record and “may not rely \nsimply on conclusory statements or on contentions that the \naffidavits supporting the motion are not credible.” Ying Jing \nGan v. City of New York, 996 F.2d 522, 532 (2d Cir. 1993).  \nIII.  \nThe defendants have moved for summary judgment on the \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims against the Port Authority, \nbased on the alleged violation of the plaintiffs’ rights under \nthe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to \nestablish either a policy or custom of unconstitutional conduct \nor that the Port Authority’s training and supervision are \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 19 of 48\nconstitutionally inadequate. The defendants primarily contend \nthat the plaintiffs cannot establish that the Port Authority had \nan unconstitutional policy, custom, or practice without a \ncertified class, and that the plaintiffs have failed to allege \nmore than a “single incident,” which is insufficient as a matter \nof law, to support municipal liability for a Section 1983 claim.  \nBoth arguments are without merit. \nThe Port Authority is treated as a municipal entity for \npurposes of Section 1983 liability. Mack v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & \nN.J., 225 F. Supp. 2d 376, 382 & n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). \n“[M]unicipalities may be sued directly under [Section] 1983 for \nconstitutional deprivations inflicted upon private individuals \npursuant to a governmental custom, policy, ordinance, \n,\nregulation, or decision.” Batista v. Rodriguez  702 F.2d 393, \n,\n397 (2d Cir. 1983) (citing Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.  436 \nU.S. 658, 690–91 (1978)). Under Monell and its progeny, \nmunicipalities are subject to liability for Section 1983 claims, \n,\nnot under a theory of respondeat superior  but rather on the \nbasis that their policies or customs inflicted the alleged \ninjuries. Id.  \nTo hold a municipality liable under Section 1983 for the \nunconstitutional actions of its employees, a plaintiff is \nrequired to plead and prove three elements: (1) the existence of \nan official policy or custom that (2) causes the plaintiff to be \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 20 of 48\n,\nsubjected to (3) a denial of a constitutional right. Batista  \n; \n702 F.2d at 397 Bertuglia v. City of New York, 133 F. Supp. 3d \n608, 649 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), aff'd sub nom. Bertuglia v. Schaffler, \n672 F. App'x 96 (2d Cir. 2016). The plaintiff may show the \nexistence of such a policy or custom by identifying any of the \nfollowing: (1) an express policy or custom; (2) an authorization \nof a policymaker of the unconstitutional practice; (3) failure \nof the municipality to train its employees, which exhibits a \n“deliberate indifference” to the rights of its citizens; or (4) \na practice of the municipal employees that is “so permanent and \nwell settled as to imply the constructive acquiescence of senior \npolicymaking officials.” Corley v. Vance, 365 F. Supp. 3d 407, \n438 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), aff'd sub nom., Corley v. Wittner, 811 F. \nApp'x 62 (2d Cir. 2020). \nIn this case, the plaintiffs have primarily sought to \nestablish that the Port Authority failed to train, supervise, or \ndiscipline PAPD officers, thereby allowing unconstitutional \npolicing practices to occur and continue.  \nTo plead a Monell claim based on a failure to train, a \nplaintiff must plead (1) that “a policymaker [of the \nmunicipality] knows ‘to a moral certainty’ that her employees \nwill confront a given situation,” (2) “that the situation either \npresents the employee with a difficult choice of the sort that \ntraining or supervision will make less difficult or that there \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 21 of 48\nis a history of employees mishandling the situation,” and (3) \n“that the wrong choice by the city employee will frequently \ncause the deprivation of a citizen’s constitutional rights.” \n,\nWalker v. City of New York  974 F.2d 293, 297–98 (2d Cir. 1992). \nA municipality is deliberately indifferent where it fails to act \nwhen it has “actual or constructive notice,” generally from “[a] \npattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained \nemployees,” that its training program is “deficient.” \nHernandez v. United States, 939 F.3d 191, 207 (2d Cir. 2019). A \nplaintiff, therefore, “must demonstrate that the municipal \naction was taken with deliberate indifference as to its known or \nobvious consequences.” Id. As the Supreme Court explained in \n,\nConnick v. Thompson  a “pattern of similar constitutional \nviolations by untrained employees is ‘ordinarily necessary’ to \ndemonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of a failure to \ntrain.” 563 U.S. 51, 62 (2011). \nThe plaintiffs have presented evidence that there are \ngenuine issues of material fact as to whether the PAPD \nadequately trained its plainclothes officers to avoid arresting \nmen without probable cause, while conducting plainclothes \npolicing patrols of bathrooms, or to avoid bias regarding sexual \norientation and gender presentation. There are genuine issues of \nmaterial fact regarding whether PAPD officers were instructed to \nemphasize arrests for “Quality of Life” issues, whether Officers \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 22 of 48\nwere given sufficient instruction as to what constituted such \n“Quality of Life” issues, and whether these policy choices \ncaused officers to target certain individuals, based on their \nperceived sexual orientation or gender presentation.  \nFor municipal liability based on a failure to supervise, \n“the municipality may be held liable for a subsequent violation \nif the superior's inaction amounts to deliberate indifference or \nto tacit authorization of the offensive acts,” after the \nsupervisor has notice of past violations. Turpin v. Mailet, 619 \nF.2d 196, 201 (2d Cir. 1980). However, under this theory of \nMonell liability, “even if a policy can be inferred from \nomissions of a municipality, such as where it acquiesces in a \npattern of illegal conduct, such a policy cannot be inferred \nfrom the failure of those in charge to discipline a single \npolice officer for a single incident of illegality”; instead, \nthere must be “more evidence of supervisory indifference, such \nas acquiescence in a prior pattern of conduct.” Lucente v. \nCounty of Suffolk, 980 F.3d 284, 306 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting \nTurpin, 619 F.2d at 201-02). \nIn this case, the plaintiffs have alleged and proffered \nevidence to establish that the PAPD officers engaged in a \npattern of policing specifically targeting men perceived as gay, \nbisexual, or otherwise gender non-conforming for arrest without \nprobable cause on charges for Public Lewdness after using the \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 23 of 48\nPABT men’s restrooms. The plaintiffs have alleged that the PAPD \nundertook a policy or custom of policing for “Quality of Life” \nissues, using inadequately trained and supervised plainclothes \npolice officers, with deliberate indifference to the potential \nfor unconstitutional search, seizure, and arrests without \nprobable cause, potentially based on impermissible bases. To \nsupport their case, the plaintiffs point to the “idiosyncratic” \nuptick in 2014 Public Lewdness arrests in connection with \nplainclothes police patrols of men’s bathrooms, evidence that \nsuggests the PAPD engaged in occasional “Quality of Life \nsweeps,” the nearly identical language used in the plaintiffs’ \nCCRs to describe the alleged behavior of the arrestee, an e-mail \nlisting the arrest of four men under similar circumstances \nwithin 48 hours as an “achievement,” and alleged inadequacies in \nthe training of the Officer Defendants. There are also plainly \ncredibility determinations required to settle conflicting \ntestimony regarding the plaintiffs’ arrests. \nIn sum, considering the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have presented \nsufficient evidence such that a reasonable factfinder could find \nthat the PAPD failed to train or to supervise and discipline \nplainclothes officers, despite awareness of past issues, that \nthis failure was done with deliberate indifference to the \nconsequences, and that this failure to train or to supervise and \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 24 of 48\ndiscipline was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs being \nunlawfully subjected to arrest without probable cause and to \narrest in violation of their rights to equal protection.   \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot maintain \ntheir Section 1983 claims without having been certified as a \nclass, citing to Chin v. Port Auth. of N.Y. and N.J., 685 F.3d \n135, 150 (2d Cir. 2012).  However, Chin was a case involving a \nprivate plaintiff seeking to bring an employment discrimination \nclaim under Title VII, based on a theory that the employer had \nengaged in a “pattern or practice” of discrimination.  The Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit, based on the text of Title \nVII and Supreme Court precedent, determined that the “pattern or \npractice” method of proving a Title VII claim was not available \nto private litigants outside of the class action context. Id. at \n149.  As such, the passage cited and the reasoning of Chin are \nirrelevant to the Section 1983 claims at issue here, because the \nChin court was exclusively focused on Title VII and the way in \nwhich private plaintiffs could pursue a “pattern or practice” \nclaim under that statute.  That case has no relevance to the \nefforts by private plaintiffs to establish Monell liability. \nIndeed, in the Section 1983 context, courts have routinely \npermitted claims against municipalities brought by individual \nplaintiffs that can establish the existence of a municipal \npolicy, without the certification of a class.  See, e.g., \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 25 of 48\nLucente, 980 F.3d at 308-310 (finding three plaintiffs had \nestablished sufficient issues of material fact to preclude \nsummary judgment on municipality’s indifference to pattern of \nsexual assaults and harassment of female inmates). \nSecond, the defendants argue that a plaintiff must show a \n“pattern” of similar constitutional violations, that \npolicymakers had “notice” of the potential for constitutional \nviolations absent adequate training or supervision, and that the \nplaintiffs have failed to demonstrate either.  The defendants \nassert that the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to establish that the other 2014 “Public Lewdness” \narrests were made without probable cause or involved persons \ntargeted because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender \npresentation.  \nHowever, the plaintiffs have introduced expert testimony to \nsupport their claim that the plaintiffs’ arrests were part of a \nnotable and “idiosyncratic” pattern of arrests with historical \nroots connected to law enforcement Public Lewdness arrests in \nmen’s bathrooms. Accordingly, there are genuine issues of \nmaterial fact as to whether a “pattern” of similar violations \noccurred, such that a reasonable jury could conclude that the \nalleged false arrests of Holden and Mejia were not mere isolated \nincidents. See, e.g., Lucente, 980 F.3d at 309-10; Cordero v. \nCity of New York, 282 F. Supp. 3d 549, 565 (E.D.N.Y. 2017).  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 26 of 48\nFurther, with regard to the “notice” requirement for the \nplaintiffs’ claims regarding the PAPD’s failure to train – the \n2004 jury verdict in Martinez case, 2005 district court \ndecision, and subsequent affirmance by the Court of Appeals, \nshould have provided PAPD officials with sufficient notice of \nthe real potential for constitutional violations that could \narise when police officers in plain clothes undertake arrests in \nmen’s bathrooms and the potential for invidious discrimination \nbased on perceived sexual orientation or gender presentation.  \nThe plaintiffs allege that the PAPD has failed to update its \ntraining, which features outdated terminology and no practical \ninstructions, despite the constitutional violations for which \nthe PAPD was previously found liable. The defendants’ argument \nthat Martinez is too remote or dissimilar from the plaintiffs’ \nclaims here to provide sufficient notice to PAPD management is \nunpersuasive.  Martinez may be too remote to be probative for \nany of the individual Officer Defendants who were not involved \nin the arrests at issue in Martinez.  However, the incidents at \nissue in Martinez and present here are similar—and a reasonable \njury could find that the PAPD’s failure to update its training \nmaterials after Martinez amounted to an unconstitutional failure \nto train, sufficient to subject the PAPD to liability for the \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 27 of 48\nFurther, the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the \nPAPD engaged in a plainclothes policing initiative without \nadequate supervision of the officers involved. At a minimum, the \ndiscrepancies in the testimony of PAPD officers, regarding \nwhether “Public Lewdness” or “Exposure of a Person” were \n“Quality of Life” issues or appropriate targets for plainclothes \npolicing, underscore that there are triable issues of fact as to \nwhether the PAPD supervision regarding bias and constitutional \nrestrictions on plainclothes policies was unconstitutionally \ndeficient. Pls.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 11; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 2, at 94; \nEx. 4, at 84; Ex. 9, at 63; Ex. 10, at 145-46; Brophy Decl. Ex. \nF, at 104, 106; Brophy Reply Decl. Ex. EE, at 78, 183. \nBecause there are disputed issues of material facts with \nregard to the existence of a “pattern,” and whether plainclothes \nofficers were adequately trained and supervised, the issue of \nMonell liability should be decided by the jury on the theory of \na failure to train or supervise. \nIV. \nThe defendants have moved for summary judgment on the \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims based on alleged violations of \nthe plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, arguing that the Officer Defendants are \nentitled to qualified immunity and, in the alternative, that the \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 28 of 48\nplaintiffs’ equal protection claims lack sufficient factual \nsupport.  \nA. \nQualified immunity protects government officials performing \ndiscretionary functions, such as arrests, “from liability for \ncivil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly \nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a \nreasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 \nU.S. 800, 818 (1982); see also Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. \n2012, 2023 (2014). The Supreme Court has instructed that courts \nshould generally follow a two-step inquiry when an official \nraises a qualified immunity defense: first determine whether \n“the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,” and \nthen determine if “the right was ‘clearly established’ at the \ntime of the challenged conduct.” Ricciuti v. Gyzenis, 834 F.3d \n162, 167 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. \n731, 735 (2011)).  \nFor the second prong of the inquiry, “[t]he dispositive \nquestion is whether the violative nature of particular conduct \nis clearly established,” and, “must be undertaken in light of \nthe specific context of the case, not as a broad general \nproposition.” Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015). The \n“clearly established right . . . must be defined with \nspecificity.” City of Escondido v. Emmons, 139 S. Ct. 500, 503 \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 29 of 48\n(2019). For a right to be clearly established “do[es] not \nrequire a case directly on point, but existing precedent must \nhave placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond \ndebate.” al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741. In determining whether a \nright is clearly established at the time of the conduct in \nquestion, courts can consider Supreme Court decisions, decisions \nof the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and “a consensus of \ncases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer \ncould not have believed that his actions were lawful.” Wilson v. \nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999). In addition, in this Circuit, \ngenuine, material disputes on factual issues that are relevant \nto the qualified immunity analysis are to be put to the jury to \nbe decided through special interrogatories. Warren v. Dwyer, 906 \nF.2d 70, 76 (2d Cir. 1990); see also Jones v. Treubig, 963 F.3d \n214, 225 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThe defendants assert that “neither the Second Circuit nor \nthe Supreme Court have held the Equal Protection Clause \nprohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nnon-conformity,” and thus such principle was not “clearly \nestablished” in 2014 at the time of the plaintiffs’ arrests.  \nThis assertion misstates the law.  \nFirst, the defendants’ claim that the Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit has not held that adverse discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or gender non-conformity is \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 30 of 48\nprohibited by the Equal Protection Clause is untrue. In 2012, \nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Windsor held that \nhomosexuality is a “quasi-suspect” class and discriminatory \ntreatment of the class is subject to “intermediate judicial \nreview.” Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 185 (2d Cir. \n2012), aff'd on other grounds, 570 U.S. 744 (2013). Courts in \nthe Second Circuit have repeatedly recognized Windsor’s \napplication of intermediate scrutiny to sexual orientation-based \nclassifications as the controlling law within this Circuit, \ndating back to before the relevant plaintiffs’ arrests in 2014. \nSee, e.g., Morgan v. Semple, No. 16-cv-225, 2020 WL 2198117, at \n*19 (D. Conn. May 6, 2020); Adkins v. City of New York, 143 F. \nSupp. 3d 134, 139 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Toliver v. Fischer, No. 12-\ncv-0077, 2015 WL 403133, at *20 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2015); \nWeslowski v. Zugibe, 14 F. Supp. 3d 295, 318 & n.7 (S.D.N.Y. \n2014) (on March 31, 2014, stating “the Second Circuit has held \nthat ‘homosexuals compose a class that is . . . quasi-suspect,’” \nand that allegations of discrimination involving this class are \n \n“subject to heightened scrutiny.”). \nMoreover, whatever the level of scrutiny, it is clear \nbeyond dispute–and was clear in 2014-that there is no basis to \narrest people based on their sexual orientation. The plaintiffs \nhave plausibly alleged and provided support for the proposition \nthat the PAPD engaged in a de facto policy of discriminatory \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 31 of 48\npolicing that specifically targeted for arrest homosexual or \ngender non-conforming men.  The plaintiffs have further alleged \na failure to train officers, despite previous well-documented \nfailings in the past.  In combination, the plaintiffs have \nalleged the very policy decisions that the Supreme Court has \nlong recognized serve no legitimate government interest and are \ninsufficient to satisfy even rational basis review under the \n,\nEqual Protection Clause. See, e.g., Romer v. Evans  517 U.S. \n620, 634–35 (1996). Cf. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 584, \n(2003) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“[T]he State cannot single \nout one identifiable class of citizens for punishment that does \nnot apply to everyone else, with moral disapproval as the only \nasserted state interest for the law.”). Indeed, long before \nWindsor, courts in this Circuit have recognized that government \ndiscrimination based on “[s]exual orientation has been held to \nbe a basis for an equal protection claim under Section 1983.” \n,\nEmblen v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J.  No. 00-cv-8877, 2002 WL \n498634, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2002); Quinn v. Nassau County \n,\nPolice Dep't  53 F. Supp. 2d 347, 356–57 (E.D.N.Y. 1999); Tester \n,\nv. City of New York  No. 95-cv-7972, 1997 WL 81662 at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 1997).  Furthermore, courts have recognized \nthat discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation can be \nsufficient to violate a plaintiff’s rights under the Equal \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 32 of 48\nProtection Clause, even if the plaintiff is not actually a \nmember of the class. See Emblen, 2002 WL 498634, at *7.  \nFinally, given that anti-homosexual bias was one of the \ntheories that provided the basis of the Martinez case’s jury \nverdict, Defs.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶ 5, the specific rights at \nissue—not to be targeted for search, seizure, and arrest without \nprobable cause, based on perceived sexual orientation or \nnonheteronormative gender presentation–were plainly “clearly \nestablished” with sufficient specificity.  \nTo support their assertion, the defendants cite to dicta in \nan employment discrimination case from 2010, involving events \noccurring before 2008. Flaherty v. Massapequa Pub. Sch., 752 F. \nSupp. 2d 286, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 2010), aff'd, 462 F. App'x 38 (2d \nCir. 2012). First, although the Flaherty Court noted that the \narea of law “remains somewhat unsettled” and rested its opinion \non other grounds, the Court noted that “it is likely that a \nperson perceived as homosexual is in a protected class for equal \nprotection purposes.” Id. Moreover, given that the Second \nCircuit’s decision in Windsor was issued in 2012 and affirmed in \n2013, the Flaherty case offers no support for the defendants.   \nThe defendants also seek to rely on the decision of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals in Naumovski v. Norris, which \nfound individual officials were entitled to qualified immunity \nfor a claim of employment discrimination in violation of the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 33 of 48\nEqual Protection Clause, on the basis of sexual orientation \narising from conduct that occurred between 2008-2010. 934 F.3d \n200, 207-09 (2d Cir. 2019). Naumovski involved a single \nplaintiff, who brought an employment discrimination suit in \n2011, prior to the decision in Windsor, and who made and then \nappeared to abandon the argument that she was discriminated \nagainst on the basis of sexual orientation. Naumovski, 934 F.3d \nat 218 & n.66. The Naumovski court explained that qualified \nimmunity applied to the officials in that case because when the \nalleged conduct occurred, Windsor had not yet been affirmed by \nthe Supreme Court. Accordingly, at that time “[i]t was, \ntherefore, not yet clear that all state distinctions based on \nsexual orientation were constitutionally suspect.” Id. at 219.  \nBy contrast, the events here all took place after the \ndecision of the Court of Appeals in Windsor and after it was \naffirmed by the Supreme Court and the plaintiffs here have \nalleged animus and systemic discrimination. Therefore, the \nindividual Officer Defendants are not entitled to qualified \nimmunity for the plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause claims. \nB. \nIn the alternative, the defendants argue that the \nplaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause claim lacks factual support.  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate that the arresting officers were aware of the \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 34 of 48\nplaintiffs’ sexual orientation or gender nonconformity, or that \nthe plaintiffs were intentionally discriminated against or \ntreated worse than “similarly situated” individuals.   \nTo prevail on a claim of selective enforcement, the \nplaintiffs must show (1) that they were treated differently from \nother similarly situated individuals, and (2) that such \ndifferential treatment was based on “‘impermissible \nconsiderations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or \npunish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or \nbad faith intent to injure a person.’” Harlen Assocs. v. \n,\nIncorporated Vill. of Mineola  273 F.3d 494, 499 (2d Cir. 2001).  \nHere, the plaintiffs have alleged that defendants violated \ntheir rights to equal protection when the plaintiffs were \nsubjected to arrest without probable cause, which the plaintiffs \nallege was the result of a deliberate targeting of gay or gender \nnon-conforming men by the PAPD officers.  The plaintiffs have \npresented evidence to show that the population of lewdness \narrests that occurred in the men’s bathroom during 2014, of \nwhich the plaintiffs’ arrests are a part, were “idiosyncratic,” \noccurred at counterintuitive times, and do not match the age or \nracial characteristics of those arrested for other offenses, and \nthat the arrests were likely driven by “intentional policy \nchoices,” and “not incidental to routine police patrols and \nstops.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 12, at 9. The plaintiffs have \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 35 of 48\npresented evidence to suggest there is a history in New York of \npolicing men’s bathrooms in order to target gay or gender non-\nconforming men, and that the idiosyncratic arrests in 2014 were \npart of that pattern. Id., Ex. 11 ¶¶ 7-9. Moreover, if credited, \nthe plaintiffs’ testimony about the way they were allegedly \ntargeted in the bathroom although they were not engaged in any \nunlawful activity, combined with the evidence of their allegedly \ngender non-conforming dress, could support an inference that \nthey were singled out because of their perceived sexual \norientation or gender presentation and not for any legitimate \nreason. Defs.’ 51.6 Stmt. ¶ 15; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 125-36; \nEx. 16 at 126-27.  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have both failed \nto show the arresting officers knew of the plaintiffs’ sexual \norientation or gender non-conformity. The defendants argue that \nthe plaintiffs have only pleaded subjective “feelings” or \n“perceptions” of being discriminated against because of their \nsexual orientation. But the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged \nthat their sexual orientation or gender non-conformity was \napparent from their appearance, and, if their testimony is \ncredited, in light of the circumstances of their arrests, a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude that the arresting \nofficers’ behavior within the bathroom suggests an attempt to \ntarget based on those apparent characteristics. As such, the \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 36 of 48\ndefendants’ arguments that the plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate they were treated worse than “similarly situated” \nindividuals are unpersuasive. The plaintiffs have presented \nsufficient evidence such that a reasonable factfinder could \nconclude that the plaintiffs were treated differently from other \nPABT patrons in violation of their right to equal protection, \nand that such differential treatment was related to an \nimpermissible consideration of their real or perceived sexual \norientation.  \nMoreover, the question of whether the arresting officers \nwere aware of the plaintiffs’ sexual orientation is a question \nof fact that depends on an assessment of all the facts and that \ncannot be resolved in the defendants’ favor on a motion for \n,\nsummary judgment. McClellan v. Smith  439 F.3d 137, 148 (2d Cir. \n2006) (“Resolutions of credibility conflicts and choices between \nconflicting versions of the facts are matters for the jury, not \nfor the court on summary judgment.”) (quoting United States v. \nRem, 38 F.3d 634, 644 (2d Cir. 1994)); cf. Savino v. Town of \nSe., 983 F. Supp. 2d 293, 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)  (conflicting \ntestimony demonstrated genuine issues of material fact existed \nfor selective enforcement claim based on national origin), \naff'd, 572 F. App'x 15 (2d Cir. 2014); Greenidge v. Costco \nWholesale, No. 09-cv-4224, 2012 WL 1077455, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. \n30, 2012) (genuine dispute over material facts existed because \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 37 of 48\nof conflicting testimony regarding whether defendants were aware \nof plaintiff’s pregnancy prior to her termination). \nFinally, the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence \nfrom which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the Port \nAuthority both had a de facto policy that caused the targeting \nof gay or gender non-conforming men with unconstitutional police \ntactics and failed to train and supervise its officers \nappropriately.  \nV. \n  The defendants have moved for summary judgment on \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims against Officer Defendants \nKehoe, Esposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, O’Dell, and \nFitzpatrick, arguing that such claims are without legal or \nfactual support and, because they were not raised in the initial \ncomplaint, they are time barred.  The plaintiffs argue that each \nof the non-arresting officers failed to ensure that the \narresting officers had established necessary probable cause for \nthe arrest of both plaintiffs and failed to supervise \nappropriately the plain-clothes policing tactics used in the \nPABT bathrooms. Further, the plaintiffs note that Captain \nFitzpatrick, as the Commanding Officer, in particular, appears \nto have had a significant role in deciding and implementing the \nPAPD’s official policies and strategic initiatives, including \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 38 of 48\nthe TPU and the alleged use of plainclothes officers to conduct \n“Quality of Life” arrests.   \nA. \n  The plaintiffs’ claims against the non-arresting Officer \nDefendants are time-barred.  The Court of Appeals has concluded \nthat Section 1983 claims based on events that occurred within \nNew York State have 3-year statute of limitations. Hogan v. \nFischer, 738 F.3d 509, 517 (2d Cir. 2013); Berman v. Perez, No. \n17-cv-2757, 2018 WL 565269, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2018). \nGenerally, “‘John Doe’ pleadings cannot be used to circumvent \nstatutes of limitations because replacing a ‘John Doe’ with a \nnamed party in effect constitutes a change in the party sued.” \nHogan, 738 F.3d at 517. As such, John Doe substitutions may \ngenerally only occur after the statute of limitations has \npassed, if the claims relate back to the original complaint and \nthe requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) are met. Id. The \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals has also recognized that Rule \n15(c)(1)(A) permits certain plaintiffs to take advantage of the \nmore lenient New York State relation-back standard for \nsubstituting unknown defendants under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 1024.  \nUnder that standard, a claim against a John Doe defendant is \ntimely if (1) the plaintiff “exercise[d] due diligence, prior to \nthe running of the statute of limitations, to identify the \ndefendant by name,” and (2) the party described the John Doe \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 39 of 48\nparty “in such form as will fairly apprise the party that [he] \nis the intended defendant.” Hogan, 738 F.3d at 519.  \nIn this case, the events occurred in May and July of 2014, \nand the plaintiffs’ original complaint was filed on March 27, \n2017, and named only Officers Opromalla, Tone, and Kehoe.  It \ndid not include Captain Fitzpatrick, even though Captain \nFitzpatrick was quoted in the New York Times article that the \nplaintiffs’ attached as an exhibit to the original complaint.  \nThe defendants note that the CCRs, which were provided on July \n6, 2017, as part of the Rule 26 disclosures, provided the names \nof Esposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, Cruz, and O’Dell.  \nNevertheless, the plaintiffs did not file a First Amended \nComplaint, adding Esposito, DeMartino, and Aylmer, until three \nmonths later on October 6, 2017, and did not file the Second \nAmended Complaint, adding Miller, Cruz, and O’Dell, until \nNovember 28, 2018.   \nThe claims against Captain Fitzpatrick are time-barred.  He \nwas known to the plaintiffs at the time they filed their First \nAmended Complaint, because he was quoted in the New York Times \narticle attached to their original complaint, and they chose not \nto sue him.  The plaintiffs failed to bring their claims against \nhim within the statute of limitations period, and the plaintiffs \ncannot rely on New York’s more lenient relation-back standard. \nLiverpool v. Davis, 442 F. Supp. 3d 714, 726 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 40 of 48\n(plaintiffs “failure to mention” a known defendant was “not the \ntype of mistake contemplated by New York's relation-back rule”); \nsee also Maurro v. Lederman, 795 N.Y.S.2d 867, 870 (Sup. Ct. \n2005) (“An explicit prerequisite to the use of C.P.L.R. § 1024 \nis plaintiff's ignorance of the defendant's name.”). \nThe plaintiffs also cannot rely on the more lenient \nstandard of C.P.L.R. § 1024 for their claims against defendants \nEsposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, Cruz, and O’Dell, because \nthe allegations in the original complaint against the John Doe \ndefendants were so general that they did not provide notice to \nthose defendants that they were intended defendants in this \nlawsuit.   \nB. \nThe plaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate a sufficient \nfactual basis for their claims against the Officer Defendants, \nother than Officers Opromalla and Tone.   \nThe plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient support \nfor their claims against Officer Kehoe. Although Officer Kehoe \nwas present for both plaintiffs’ arrests, the parties agree that \nOfficer Kehoe was standing outside the bathroom while Officers \nTone and Opromalla went into the bathroom and that Officers Tone \nand Opromalla prepared the plaintiffs’ respective arrest \npaperwork. In Mejia’s case, Mejia does not appear to allege that \nOfficer Kehoe was the alleged “short” plainclothes officer who \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 41 of 48\n“smirked” at him, and Officer Tone was the only officer to \ntestify at Mejia’s trial. The plaintiffs note that Officer Kehoe \nwas among the five officers responsible for the majority of the \nPublic Lewdness arrests in 2014, Spitzer Decl. Ex. 12 ¶ 32, but \nthere is no evidence in the record to establish a genuine issue \nregarding whether Officer Kehoe had reason to disbelieve the \ndescription of the plaintiffs’ conduct given by Officers Tone \nand Opromalla.  The Court of Appeals has instructed that for \npurposes of making a probable cause determination, police \nofficers are entitled to rely on the allegations of fellow \npolice officers. Martinez v. Simonetti, 202 F.3d 625, 634 (2d \nCir. 2000); Bernard v. United States, 25 F.3d 98, 102–03 (2d \nCir. 1994). As such, there are no genuine issues regarding \nOfficer Kehoe’s personal involvement in the plaintiffs’ alleged \nfalse arrests, because Officer Kehoe’s mere presence at the \nscene is not a sufficient factual basis to establish liability. \nMinter v. City Of Westchester, No. 08-cv-7726, 2011 WL 856269 at \n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 20, 2011).  \n  The plaintiffs have similarly failed to demonstrate a \nsufficient factual basis for their claims against the remaining \nnon-arresting Officer Defendants, who served in supervisory \ncapacities: Esposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, O’Dell, and \nFitzpatrick.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 42 of 48\nPrior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662 (2009), within the Second Circuit, “the personal \ninvolvement of a supervisory defendant [could have been] shown \nby evidence that: (1) the defendant participated directly in the \nalleged constitutional violation, (2) the defendant, after being \ninformed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed to \nremedy the wrong, (3) the defendant created a policy or custom \nunder which unconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed the \ncontinuance of such a policy or custom, (4) the defendant was \ngrossly negligent in supervising subordinates who committed the \nwrongful acts, or (5) the defendant exhibited deliberate \nindifference to the rights of [plaintiffs] by failing to act on \ninformation indicating that unconstitutional acts were \noccurring.” Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995). \nAfter Iqbal, there was considerable uncertainty as to whether \neach of the five Colon factors remained a sufficient basis for \nestablishing individual liability for supervisors. See \nReynolds v. Barrett, 685 F.3d 193, 205 & n.14 (2d Cir. 2012); \nCompare Brandon v. Kinter, 938 F.3d 21, 36 (2d Cir. 2019) \n(applying Colon factors without caveats), with Lombardo v. \nGraham, 807 F. App'x 120, 124 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2020) (noting that \nthe Court need not reach the issue of whether all five Colon \nfactors remain sufficient bases for liability). But the Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit has recently emphasized that \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 43 of 48\n“there is no special rule for supervisory liability,” after \nIqbal, and thus, a “plaintiff must plead that each Government-\nofficial defendant, through the official’s own individual \nactions, has violated the Constitution.” Tangreti v. Bachmann, \n983 F.3d 609, 616 (2d Cir. 2020).  The plaintiffs cannot rely \n“on a separate test of liability specific to supervisors.” Id. \nat 619. \nHere, the plaintiffs’ briefs appear to assert that the \nsupervisory Officer Defendants individually participated through \ntheir failure to ensure that sufficient probable cause existed \nfor the plaintiffs’ arrest and for failing to supervise the \nplainclothes officers’ policing of the PABT bathrooms and \nfailing to ensure that arrests were not made based on \nimpermissible bias.   \nHowever, the plaintiffs have failed to establish a \nsufficient basis for finding Lt. Aylmer, Sgt. DeMartino, Sgt. \nEsposito, Lt. O’Dell, and Sgt. Miller’s own individual actions \nin connection with their review of post-arrest paperwork \nviolated the Constitution.  The plaintiffs have not alleged that \nthese officers had knowledge of the arrests before they \noccurred, and their involvement was solely in connection with \nthe post-arrest paperwork. But officers are “entitled to rely on \nthe allegations of fellow police officers” who were present “at \nthe scene.” See, e.g., Martinez v. Simonetti, 202 F.3d 625, 634-\n43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 44 of 48\n35 (2d Cir. 2000).  The plaintiffs have presented no evidence \nthat Lt. Aylmer, Sgt. DeMartino, Sgt. Esposito, Lt. O’Dell, or \nSgt. Miller had any reason to know that Officers Tone or \nOpromalla did not have probable cause for the arrests at the \ntime.  Both Officers Opromalla and Tone have admitted both to \nmaking the arrests and completing the arrest paperwork, and \nthere is no evidence in the record to suggest genuine issues of \nfact regarding whether the supervising officers personally \nparticipated in making arrests without probable cause or \nfalsifying arrest records.  \n  Similarly, the plaintiffs argue that Captain Fitzpatrick is \npersonally responsible for establishing a policy and practice \nof, among other things, emphasizing “Public Lewdness” and \n“Quality of Life” crimes, failing to supervise officers under \nhis command, and for directing Officer Opromalla to “continue to \nenforce” Public Lewdness laws while assigned to plainclothes \npolicing.  At best, plaintiffs have presented evidence \nsuggesting Captain Fitzpatrick was indifferent to the risks of \nunconstitutional false arrests or equal protection violations, \ncaused by the combination of the officers’ lack of adequate \ntraining, and his alleged emphasis on policing Public Lewdness.  \nBut there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that \nCaptain Fitzpatrick was personally involved in the arrests of \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 45 of 48\nthe plaintiffs with an awareness that the arrests were made \nwithout probable cause or based on an impermissible bias.  \nThus, the plaintiffs have failed to adduce sufficient \nevidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the \nnon-arresting officers were personally involved in any \nconstitutional violations.   \nVI. \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ general \nallegations that their rights to “due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment” were violated because they were targeted \nbased on their perceived sexual orientation or gender non-\nconformity fail to state a claim.  The defendants further assert \nthat the plaintiffs’ claims that their liberty interests in \nprivacy were violated by the defendants’ actions are not \ncognizable.  The defendants have also contended that-to the \nextent that the plaintiffs allege unlawful entrapment-such an \nallegation is not an independent ground for civil liability.  \nTo state a claim for a violation of a plaintiff’s \nsubstantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, a \nplaintiff must allege some valid liberty or property interest, \nupon which the defendants infringed. Harlen Assocs., 273 F.3d at \n503.  While the Supreme Court has recognized that the Due \nProcess Clause protects certain substantive liberty interests in \nprivacy and bodily integrity, the plaintiffs here are not \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 46 of 48\nchallenging the Public Lewdness statute as being \nunconstitutionally vague or otherwise facially invalid and are \ninstead only challenging its specific application to their \nalleged unlawful search, seizure, and false arrest without \nprobable cause.  As a result, the plaintiffs’ due process \nallegations in their complaint sound in the Fourth Amendment’s \nprohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. When \nfaced with similar claims, courts in this Circuit have been \ninstructed that the Fourth Amendment, rather than Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process clause, should serve as the “guide for \nanalyzing these claims,” given the more “explicit textual source \nof constitutional protection.” Russo v. City of Bridgeport, 479 \nF.3d 196, 209 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. \n386, 395 (1989)); Lauro v. Charles, 219 F.3d 202, 208 (2d Cir. \n2000); Abreu v. City of New York, No. 17-cv-6179, 2018 WL \n3315572, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2018); Ambrose v. City of New \nYork, 623 F. Supp. 2d 454, 474 & n.9 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).  \nAlthough the plaintiffs stated at oral argument that they \nintend to pursue their substantive due process claims, their \nbrief only discusses invasion of privacy in the context of the \nalleged violations of their Fourth Amendment rights. \nNext, as the plaintiffs correctly note, their Second \nAmended Complaint does not include a standalone “entrapment” \nclaim, and thus, the defendants’ arguments that entrapment is \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 47 of 48\nnot an independent ground for liability under Section 1983 are \nirrelevant.  \nTherefore, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment \ndismissing the plaintiffs’ claims based on alleged violations of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \nVII.  \n  The defendants assert that neither the Port Authority nor \nthe PAPD can be held liable for punitive damages. Although the \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit has not addressed the \nquestion, other courts in this district have applied to the Port \nAuthority the Supreme Court’s reasoning in City of Newport v. \nFact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 261 (1981), that \nmunicipalities should not be subject to punitive damages. Vernon \nv. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 154 F. Supp. 2d 844, 860 (S.D.N.Y. \n2001) (collecting cases).  While the Port Authority is a self-\nfinancing agency, funded by user fees, the wrongdoing of the \nPort Authority’s officials should not be borne by the public \ngenerally.  The combination of the Port Authority’s liability \nfor compensatory damages and individual officer liability for \nboth compensatory and punitive damages should be sufficient to \nsatisfy the goal of deterrence. Thus, the Court is persuaded to \njoin the majority of courts to have considered the issue and \nfind that the Port Authority—and the PAPD as one of its \nconstituent agencies—is immune from punitive damages. See \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 48 of 48\nEvans v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 273 F.3d 346, 357 (3d Cir. \n2001); Ryduchowski v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. 96-cv-5589, \n1998 WL 812633, at *15 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 1998). In a letter, \nfiled after oral argument, the plaintiffs have conceded that \npunitive damages are not available against the Port Authority. \nECF No. 249. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court has considered all of the arguments of the \nparties. To the extent not specifically addressed above, the \nremaining arguments are either moot or without merit. For the \nreasons explained above, the defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment is denied in part and granted in part. The Clerk is \ndirected to close Docket Nos. 201 & 226. \n \nSO ORDERED. \n \nDated:  New York, New York \nFebruary 22, 2021        ____/s/ John G. Koeltl_______ \n                      John G.

Upon execution of this Agreement, the Parties will dismiss this case without \nprejudice subject to reinstatement by Plaintiffs if but only if the equitable terms of Agreement that \nare to be performed within the three-month period following execution of the Agreement have not \nbeen performed, but only if non-performance is determined by Judge Lehrburger.  \nA)  The Equitable Relief To Be Undertaken by The PANYNJ \n2.  The PANYNJ hereby agrees to undertake the equitable relief set forth in \nparagraphs “3” through “9” herein as the equitable part of the settlement of all claims that were or \ncould have been brought by Plaintiffs, in this proceeding.    \n3.  The PAPD has not been, and is not currently, conducting plain clothes \npolice patrols for public lewdness or exposure of a person in the public restrooms at the Port \nAuthority Bus Terminal, and any future plain clothes operations focused on public lewdness or \nexposure of a person in the public restrooms at the Bus Terminal, to the extent they become needed, \nwould first be reviewed and approved by senior PAPD officials. \n4.  For  a  period  of  not  less  than  three  years,  the  PAPD  will  incorporate \nmandatory LGBTQ+ (also meant to encompass the larger community reference of LGBTQIA+) \nSensitivity and Awareness training facilitated by members of the Gay Officers’ Action League \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 281-1   Filed 05/31/22   Page 3 of 10\n(GOAL) into the training provided to each PAPD recruit class.  The training will last a minimum \nof four hours and will substantially cover the instructional goals, performance objectives, and \ninstructional content of the PANYNJ’s redline of the NYPD’s “Policing and the LGBTQ+ \nCommunity” lesson plan.  The PANYNJ will adapt the NYPD’s instructional content to its \ncurriculum, so as to make it relevant to a bi-state agency and its policing functions.  The Port \nAuthority will begin GOAL training with the first recruit class of 2022. \n5.  PAPD officials will read an instructional memorandum regarding bias-\nbased policing at roll call for all tours of duty over a single twenty-four hour period by a date not \nmore than three (3) months from the execution of this Agreement, stating:  \n“All members of the force must conduct themselves at all times in the \ndischarge  of  their  duties  with  fairness  and  without  any  semblance  of \ndiscrimination based on race, religion, national origin or sex, including sexual \norientation and gender identity.  Discrimination by a police officer undermines \nthe public’s confidence in the entire department.  The department views any \nsubstantiated  complaint  of  discrimination  as  determined  by  the  Agency’s \nCivilian  Complaint  Review  Board  to  constitute  a  serious  violation  of  an \nofficer’s oath of office, and where appropriate, disciplinary charges, including \na recommendation of Major Discipline, will be brought.” \n \nThe PANYNJ will provide written notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel that the instructional memorandum \ndescribed in this paragraph has been read as described herein. \n6.  PAPD officials will read an instructional memorandum regarding the use of \nboilerplate language in incident reports and arrest reports at roll call for all tours of duty over a \ntwenty-four-hour period by a date not more than three (3) months from the execution of this \nAgreement, stating: \n“The narrative portion of incident reports and arrest reports should \ngenerally contain a statement of the facts demonstrating probable cause \nfor the arrest. Boilerplate language should be avoided where possible.  \nThe report should include, where possible, such information as: a) \nidentification of involved parties; b) victim/witness/suspect statements; \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 281-1   Filed 05/31/22   Page 4 of 10\nc)  officer’s  observations  and  actions;  d)  description  of  physical \nevidence; and e) other pertinent information.” \n \nThe PANYNJ will provide written notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel that the instructional memorandum \ndescribed in this paragraph has been read herein. \n7.  On January 31, 2021, the PAPD created and filled a position known as Chief \nof Agency Affairs in PAPD, and that Chief will be a point of contact and liaison for members of \nthe LGBTQ+ community who use the PANYNJ facilities.  PAPD will issue a press release \nannouncing the addition of the above-described LGBTQ + liaison responsibilities to the Chief of \nAgency Affairs position by a date not more than three (3) months from the execution of this \nAgreement and will provide written notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel upon completion of the issuance \nof the press release.  The Chief of Agency Affairs will reach out to the New York City Antiviolence \nProject and Garden State Equality, whose contact information will be provided in writing by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel upon execution of this Agreement, by a date not more than three (3) months \nfrom the execution of this Settlement Agreement to advise those organizations of this position’s \nrole as a liaison for the LGBTQ+ community and so as to learn of any potential concerns related \nto PANYNJ’s facilities. The PANYJ will provide written notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel that this \ncommunication has been made.  \n8.  To  help  ensure  accountability,  PAPD  officers’  conduct  has  long  been \nsubject to review by a Civilian Complaint Review Board, which receives complaints from \nmembers of the public on a pre-printed form. The pre-printed form will be updated, to include \noptional fields where the complainant can provide information about their sexual orientation and \ngender identity, as shown in Exhibit A hereto, by a date not more than three (3) months from the \nexecution of this Agreement.  A link to the updated Civilian Complaint form will be provided on \nthe PAPD’s FAQ Page under “How do I file a complaint against a Port Authority police officer” \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 281-1   Filed 05/31/22   Page 5 of 10\nby a date not more than three (3) months from the execution of this Agreement. PANYNJ will \nnotify Plaintiffs’ counsel in writing when the updated form is available on the link as described \nabove. \n9.  Restroom  signage  for  the  Port  Authority  Bus  Terminal  single-stall \nrestrooms will be promptly replaced, to reflect the following: \n“This restroom may be used by any person regardless of gender identity \nor expression.” \n \nThe PANYNJ will provide written notice to Plaintiffs’ counsel when the signage has been \ninstalled.  \nB)  Procedure For Determining Compliance With Equitable Relief \nto Be Performed Within The Three-Month Period \n10.  If  at  the  end  of  the  three-month  period  from  the  execution  of  this \nAgreement, Plaintiffs believe that the PANYNJ has not performed the equitable relief it agreed to \nperform within three months, it shall so notify the PANYNJ in writing within 30 days of the end \nof the three-month period.  The Parties will then engage in good faith discussion to resolve the \nissue. If the issue is not resolved within 30 days of the receipt of notice of non-compliance, then \nthe Parties shall submit the issue of compliance to Judge Lehrburger.  If Judge Lehrburger \ndetermines that the PANYNJ has not complied, then the Plaintiffs may reinstate this action, and if \nJudge Lehrburger determines that the PANYNJ has complied then Plaintiffs may not seek to \nreinstate  this  action  unless  the  PANYNJ  defaults  on  their  payment  obligations  under  this \nAgreement. \nC)  Parties’ Obligations Upon Compliance By the PANYNJ At The \nEnd of The Three-Month Period \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 281-1   Filed 05/31/22   Page 6 of 10\n11.  Upon agreement of the Parties, or resolution by the Court, that the PAPD \nhas performed its three-month obligations, then Plaintiffs will promptly provide the PANYNJ with \na Stipulation of Dismissal with prejudice, without costs or attorneys’ fees, signed by all counsel \nfor Plaintiffs, as well as duly executed General Releases from each Plaintiff in favor of the \nremaining Defendants (i.e. PANYNJ, PAPD, and Opromalla and Tone), which shall be held in \nescrow until payment is made as stated in paragraph 12.   \n12.  The PANYNJ hereby agrees to pay, within 30 days of the receipt of the \nStipulation of Dismissal with prejudice and the General Releases described in paragraph 11 hereof, \nto issue payment in the sum of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) to Plaintiff Cornell Holden, \nand payment in the sum of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) to Plaintiff Miguel Mejia and \nto deliver these payments to Plaintiffs’ counsel, Winston & Strawn LLP.  As noted below, the \nParties agree that the Defendants are not liable for, and shall not pay, any Attorneys’ fees.  \n13.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be an admission by the \nDefendants that they have in any manner or way violated Plaintiffs’ rights, or the rights of any \nother person or entity, as defined in the constitutions, statutes, ordinances, rules or regulations of \nthe United States, the State of New York and New Jersey, or any other rules or regulations \napplicable to the PANYNJ.  The terms of this Agreement shall not be admissible in, nor are they \nrelated to, any other litigation or settlement negotiations, except to enforce the terms of this \nAgreement. \n14.  Each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees. \n15.  This Agreement may be specifically enforced and may be used as evidence \nin a proceeding in which any party alleges a breach of this Agreement. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 281-1   Filed 05/31/22   Page 7 of 10\n \nMay 31\n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 281-1   Filed 05/31/22   Page 8 of 10\n \nExhibit A \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 281-1   Filed 05/31/22   Page 9 of 10\nPOLICE CIVILIAN COMPLAINT FORM  PA 3962 / 05--22 \nPage 1 of 2 \n☐Force ☐Abuse of Authority ☐Discourtesy ☐Ethnic/Bias ☐Other CCC # \nDate of Occurrence  Time of Occurrence  Location of Occurrence  Facility \nDay of Week  Municipality  How Complaint Received  Receiving Command  Date  Time \n☐In Person  ☐ Telephone  ☐ Other\nDate Reported  Time  CCIU Notified  If yes, Title and Name of Person Notified \n☐Yes ☐No\nPerson Assisting  Complainant’s Name (Last, First, M.I.) \nComplainant’s Address (Street)  Apt. #  City/Town  State  Zip Code \nDate of Birth  Sex  Race  Primary Contact Number  E-Mail Address\nGender Identity (Optional)  Sexual Orientation (Optional) \nRank/Name of Police member complained of (if unknown, provide detailed description of officer and type of duty performed), if \nmore than one officer complained of, state number of police officers involved, or officers that might have been at the scene.\nRank  Name  Badge #  Tax #  Car #  Command  Specialized Unit \n1 \n2 \nWitness/Victim (Last, Name, First, M.I.)

KOELTL, District Judge: \nThe plaintiffs, Cornell Holden and Miguel Mejia, have \nbrought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the \nPort Authority of New York and New Jersey (the “Port \nAuthority”), the Port Authority Police Department (the “PAPD”), \nand Michael Opromalla, Shaun Kehoe, John Tone, Jordan Esposito, \nMichael DeMartino, Richard Aylmer, Paul Miller, John \nFitzpatrick, and Paul O’Dell (collectively, the “Officer \nDefendants”), in their individual and official capacities, as \nofficers of the PAPD, for alleged violations of the plaintiffs’ \nrights guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs have \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 2 of 48\nalleged (1) false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, \n(2) impermissible discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation or gender non-conformity in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and (3) \ninfringement of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In addition, the plaintiffs \nhave sought punitive damages. The plaintiffs allege that the \nOfficer Defendants targeted them, or failed to supervise \narresting officers who targeted them, for unlawful search, \nseizure, and false arrest without probable cause, based on the \nimpermissible consideration of their perceived sexual \norientation or gender non-conforming presentation.  Further, the \nplaintiffs claim that the Port Authority engaged in and \nperpetuated a de facto custom or policy of failing to supervise, \ntrain, or discipline officers assigned to plainclothes \npatrolling of the Port Authority Bus Terminal (the “PABT”) men’s \nbathrooms, resulting in the targeting of men perceived to be gay \nor bisexual, men who have sex with men, or who are otherwise \ngender non-conforming, for unlawful searches, seizures, false \narrests without probable cause.  \nThe defendants have moved for partial summary judgment on \n(1) all claims against the Port Authority, (2) all claims \nagainst the non-arresting Officer Defendants, namely, Kehoe, \nEsposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, O’Dell, and Fitzpatrick, \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 3 of 48\nand (3) all claims based on alleged violations of the \nplaintiffs’ rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nEqual Protection Clause and Due Process Clause. The defendants \nalso argue that the plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages \nagainst the Port Authority should be dismissed.1  \nFor the reasons that follow, the defendants’ motion is \ngranted with respect to the plaintiffs’ claims against non-\narresting Officer Defendants, claims based on the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process Clause, and request for punitive damages \nagainst the Port Authority, and denied in all other respects.  \nI. \nThe following facts are taken from the Second Amended \nComplaint, declarations and exhibits filed in connection with \nthe motions, and the parties’ Local Rule 56.1 statements, and \nare undisputed unless otherwise noted. \nA. \nThe defendant Port Authority is a bi-state government \nagency, created by a compact between, and authorized under the \nlaws of, the States of New York and New Jersey. Defs.’ 56.1 \nStmt. ¶¶ 1-2. The Port Authority is authorized to maintain a \nPublic Safety Department, the PAPD, that employs officers with \nstatewide jurisdiction in New York. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 3.  The \n \n1  The defendants have not moved for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ \nclaims against Officers Opromalla and Tone for false arrest in violation of \nthe plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 4 of 48\nPort Authority owns and operates the PABT at 625 Eighth Avenue \nin New York, New York, which is patrolled by PAPD officers. \nDefs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 4.  The individual Officer Defendants were \nofficers and employees of the PAPD during the relevant period at \nissue.   \nThe plaintiffs Cornell Holden and Miguel Mejia were \narrested after using the men’s restroom on the second floor of \nthe PABT in 2014.   \nHolden was arrested on May 12, 2014 around 9 a.m., shortly \nafter he exited the second floor PABT men’s restroom.  Defs.’ \n56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 21-22.  Holden is a black male who was 27 years \nold, lived in the Bronx, and worked in Long Island City at the \ntime of the arrest. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 24; Declaration of \nThomas Brophy, ECF No. 228, (“Brophy Decl.”), Ex. M, at 81. \nHolden, who works as a baker, testified that on the morning of \nMay 12, he was passing through the PABT on his way to a cake \nshop in Manhattan. Declaration of Seth Spitzer, ECF No. 232 \n(“Spitzer Decl.”), Ex. 15, at 123; Ex. 20, at 3. Holden \ntestified that he had entered the PABT men’s bathroom, gone to \nthe only vacant urinal, and that while at the urinal, he noticed \na bald, Caucasian male wearing “regular clothing,” later \nidentified as Officer Opromalla in plain clothes, standing at \nthe adjacent urinal. Brophy Decl. Ex. M, at 127, 135, 150. \nHolden testified that as he was finishing at the urinal, Officer \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 5 of 48\nOpromalla “stepped back and looked past the divider” at Holden \nand then exited the bathroom. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 136.  \nHolden reported that after he finished using the urinal, he \nrealized that he was having a nosebleed, and remained in the \nbathroom until the bleeding stopped. Id. at 137. After Holden \nleft the bathroom, he was approached by two plainclothes \nofficers, defendants Opromalla and Kehoe, who, according to \nHolden’s testimony, asked him if he got “the wrong impression \nabout anyone in the bathroom” and about “what happened in the \nbathroom.” Id. at 143-44. Holden was then placed under arrest, \nand when he asked for an explanation, the officers told him that \nhe was “seen doing a lewd act in the bathroom.” Id. at 146.  \nOfficer Opromalla, who had identified Holden as having committed \na lewd act, later told Holden that he was “standing by the \nurinal . . . erect” and that he “kn[e]w what he did.” Spitzer \nDecl. Ex. 15, at 150-151.  \nHolden testified that, while in PABT custody, he overheard \ncertain PAPD officers congratulate Officer Opromalla on the \narrest and heard a male PAPD officer joke about Officer \nOpromalla “having a date . . . tonight” and describe Officer \nOpromalla as a “gay whisperer,” which Holden understood as a \nreference to Officer Opromalla’s ability to “catch” gay men. Id. \nat 156-59. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 6 of 48\nThe parties dispute the degree of involvement of Officer \nKehoe in Holden’s arrest, but the parties agree that Officer \nOpromalla prepared the arrest paperwork and Officer Opromalla is \nlisted as the “Arresting Officer” on Holden’s Criminal Complaint \nArrest Report (“CCR”). Spitzer Decl. Ex. 17; Brophy Decl. Ex. C, \n207-11; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 4, at 210-13. It similarly appears \nundisputed that Officer Kehoe was outside of the bathroom at the \ntime that Officer Opromalla reported observing Holden’s \nbehavior. Brophy Decl. Ex. C, at 205-06; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. \n¶¶ 29, 33. Holden’s CCR, prepared by Officer Opromalla, stated \nthat Opromalla “observed the defendant . . . expose his naked \nerect penis at the urinal and manipulate it in a back and forth \nmotion in full public view.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 17, at PA 000018. \nThe parties agree that Lt. O’Dell, Sgt. Miller, Sgt. DeMartino, \nand Sgt. Esposito were not present at Holden’s arrest, but \nsigned Holden’s post-arrest paperwork. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 40-\n43; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 40-43.   \nIt is undisputed that Officer Opromalla did not make \nexplicit reference to Holden’s sexuality during the arrest. \nDefs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 45; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶ 45. \nNevertheless, Holden, who identifies as a gay male, Defs.’ 56.1 \nStmt. ¶ 27; Brophy Decl. Ex. C; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 73, \ntestified that he believed that it was clear from his appearance \nthat he was gay. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 170. Holden testified \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 7 of 48\nhe had his hair in a mohawk and that he was wearing fitted denim \npants, a black leather jacket, silver hoop earrings, a silver \nchain necklace, a silver name ring, a beaded bracelet, high-top \nsneakers, and a duffle bag with a Fred Perry logo. Spitzer Decl. \nEx. 15, at 98-104, 170; Brophy Decl. Ex. M, at 98-106, 170. The \ncharges against Holden were ultimately dismissed on December 9, \n2014. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 41-42. \nMejia was arrested on July 9, 2014 at approximately 5:06 \np.m., shortly after leaving the same PABT men’s bathroom. Mejia \nis a white Hispanic male, who was 43 years old, living in \nManhattan and employed at the Family Help Living Center at the \ntime of his arrest in 2014. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 54-55; Brophy \nDecl. Ex. P, at 12, 16-18.  He was at the PABT in order to take \na 5:12 p.m. bus to Clifton, New Jersey. Pls.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 57. \nMejia testified that when he entered the PABT men’s restroom, he \nwent to the only vacant urinal. Id. at ¶ 63; Brophy Decl. Ex. P, \nat 124-25.  \nThere are several discrepancies between the parties’ \naccounts of the events leading up to Mejia’s arrest. Mejia \ntestified that while he was using the urinal, he noticed a \n“short” man to his right, who “smirked” at Mejia when Mejia \nlooked at him. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 16, at 126-27, 156-57. Officer \nTone testified that he entered the bathroom, in plain clothes, \nand while standing by the sinks, he noticed that Mejia was \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 8 of 48\nlooking at the man to his right, that Mejia “turned his body” \ntowards the man, and that he saw Mejia’s arm moving “rapidly.” \nDeclaration of Thomas Brophy, ECF No. 236 (“Brophy Reply \nDecl.”), Ex. T, at 118, 127, 133.  Officer Tone reported that he \n“took a few steps” towards Mejia “where [he] was able to see the \n[alleged] criminal act.” Brophy Decl. Ex. F, at 133. Officer \nTone reported he was not aware if the other man saw Mejia’s \npenis. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 6, at 139-40. The parties appear to \nagree that Officer Kehoe had remained outside of the bathroom, \nalso in plain clothes. Brophy Decl. Ex. D, at 21-24; Ex. F, at \n117; Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶ 60. \nThe parties agree that Mejia was arrested by Officer Tone, \nwith the assistance of Officer Kehoe, after Mejia left the men’s \nbathroom. However, Mejia testified that he was arrested by three \nmen, and specifically that the short man who “smirked” at him \nwas a PAPD Officer in plain clothes and assisted Officers Tone \nand Kehoe with the arrest.  Brophy Decl. Ex. P, at 156-157.  \nOfficer Tone, however, reported that he and Officer Kehoe made \nthe arrest and were patrolling alone, without the assistance of \na third officer, Spitzer Decl. Ex. 6, at 116-17, 141, and that, \nalthough he noticed Mejia and the man to Mejia’s right staring \nat each other, he could not describe the man to Mejia’s right. \nBrophy Decl. Ex. F, at 128.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 9 of 48\nMejia testified that when he asked why he was under arrest, \nOfficer Tone said, “[Y]ou know what you did.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. \n16, 156-61. Mejia was charged with “Public Lewdness” and \n“Exposure of a Person.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 18. Officer Tone \nprepared Mejia’s CCR, reporting that while “working in the \nTactical Plain Clothes Unit,” in the second floor PABT men’s \nroom, Tone “observe[d] the defendant manipulating his naked \nerect penis in a back and forth motion in full public view in a \npublic place.” Id. Officer Tone is listed as the arresting \nofficer on Mejia’s CCR, and there is no mention of either \nOfficer Kehoe or another plainclothes officer in Mejia’s CCR. \nBrophy Decl. Ex. O. The parties agree that Sgt. DeMartino and \nLt. Aylmer were not present at Mejia’s arrest, but signed \nMejia’s post-arrest paperwork. Pls.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶¶ 70-71.   \nOn November 17, 2014, Mejia was acquitted after a bench \ntrial in New York criminal court, at which Officer Tone was the \nonly officer to testify. Defs.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 73-74. \nMejia, who does not “identify” with a particular \ndescription of his sexual orientation, was previously married to \na woman, has dated men, and was dating a man at the time of his \narrest for over a year. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 16, at 33, 97-98. \nMejia suggested that his appearance “could have” given “off the \nimpression” that he was homosexual or otherwise gender non-\nconforming. Spitzer Decl. Ex. 16, at 208-09.

Ex. I.  \nOf the 69 arrests for Public Lewdness that occurred in the PABT \nmen’s bathroom in 2014, 7 occurred before Holden’s arrest in May \nand 32 arrests occurred before Mejia’s arrest in July. Defs.’ \n56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 17-18; Brophy Decl. Exs.

The plaintiffs have presented \nanonymous, sworn affidavits from men who claim to have been \narrested in the PABT men’s bathroom for Public Lewdness and who \nallege that they were targeted because of their perceived sexual \norientation or gender presentation. Spitzer Decl. Exs. 21, 22, \n23, 24, 25.2  The plaintiffs have also submitted two expert \nreports, from Drs. Pfaff and Pierceson, offering opinions that \nsuggest the patterns of arrests in 2014 for Public Lewdness were \ndriven by an “intentional policy choice,” and note historic \nincidents of discrimination against the LGBTQ community by law \nenforcement.  Spitzer Decl. Ex. 11 at ¶¶ 20-21; Ex. 12 at ¶ 9. \nDr. Pfaff’s report notes that the population of lewdness arrests \nthat occurred in the men’s bathroom during 2014, including the \nplaintiffs’ arrests, are “idiosyncratic,” occurred at \ncounterintuitive times, and do not match the age or racial \ncharacteristics of those arrested for other offenses.  Spitzer \nDecl. Ex. 12 at ¶ 9. Dr. Pfaff has opined that the data suggests \nthat such arrests were driven by “intentional policy choices,” \nand “not incidental to routine police patrols and stops.” Id.  \n \n2 The plaintiffs have also presented an affidavit from Marcos Polonia, \npreviously a named plaintiff in this case, with details of his arrest in \n2014, including allegations that he was targeted based on his apparent sexual \norientation.  Polonia dropped his claims prior to his deposition, but stated \nhe “plan[ned] to continue to participate as a class member.” Spitzer Decl. \nEx. 35. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 12 of 48\nDuring the relevant period at issue, the PAPD engaged in \nplainclothes policing of the PABT, including the men’s \nrestrooms, through a “Tactical Patrol Unit” (“TPU”).  Spitzer \nDecl. Ex. 1; Ex. 2, at 98; Ex. 9, at 65.  There is some evidence \nin the record to suggest that, during 2014, the TPU was involved \nin combating certain “Quality of Life” complaints and issues. \nSpitzer Decl. Ex. 1; Ex. 9, at 62; Ex. 32, at 158-61.  There is \nconflicting testimony regarding whether the PAPD engaged in \n“sweeps” for “Quality of Life” crimes or issues. See, e.g., \nSpitzer Decl. Ex. 2, at 94; Ex. 9, at 118-21; Ex. 10, at 144-46.  \nHowever, the plaintiffs have produced a Port Authority Public \nSafety Memorandum from May 2, 2014, that includes among \n“Achievements/Initiatives” that PAPD officers at the PABT \n“collaborated with the NYPD during Quality of Life sweep[s],” \nincluding “two 24 hour sweeps,” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 1, at 9-10, as \nwell as a “Buckslip” from June 22, 2015 about a 24-hour “Quality \nof Life Joint Operation” between NYPD and PAPD to conduct “zero \ntolerance sweeps” inside and around the Port Authority, Spitzer \nDecl. Ex. 7. \nThe parties agree that “Public Lewdness” and “Exposure of a \nPerson” in a public place are misdemeanor crimes, prohibited by \nN.Y. Penal Law §§ 245.00 and 245.01, respectively, and that \nmasturbation in a public place is a crime under N.Y. Penal Law \n§§ 245.00 and 245.01.  Pls.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 6-8.  But there is \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 13 of 48\nsome disagreement among the Officer Defendants as to whether \n“Public Lewdness” or “Exposure of a Person” would be considered \nQuality of Life issues, and, as such, appropriate targets of any \npotential “Quality of Life” initiative. For example, when asked \nabout how officers under his supervision were to know which \n“Quality of Life” issues warranted attention, Captain \nFitzpatrick testified that he “d[i]dn’t think you have to define \nit,” because “Police know exactly what they’re looking for.” \nBrophy Decl. Ex. B, at 176. At least two officers testified that \nthey personally considered either “Exposure of a Person” or \n“Public Lewdness” to be a “Quality of Life” issue, but did not \nknow whether “Public Lewdness” or “Exposure of a Person” was \nconsidered a Quality of Life offense according to PAPD policy.  \nBrophy Reply Decl. Ex. EE, at 78, 183; Spitzer Decl., Ex. 10, at \n143-46. See also Brophy Decl. Ex.

C, at 124, \n292; Ex. D, 58-60; Brophy Reply Decl. Ex. Z, at 267-69. The \nplaintiffs dispute the absence of quotas by pointing to the May \n2014 Memorandum sent by Michael Fedorko, the Port Authority’s \nDirector of Public Safety, which included among a list of \n“Achievements/Initiatives” that: \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 14 of 48\nDay tour team utilized [Defendant Opromalla] on 4/28/14 and \n4/29/14 to apprehend four (4) different male subjects from \nthe men’s room on the Suburban Concourse.  These subjects \nwere observed performing a lewd act in a public place.  \nSubjects subsequently charged with Public Lewdness. \nSpitzer Decl. Ex. 1.  \nPatrolling the men’s bathroom was considered a part of at \nleast one of the TPU patrol posts. Officer Opromalla reported \nthat “the first day [he] worked plain clothes [he] was informed \nby a supervisor” of the “activities and behavior that go on in \n[the PABT men’s bathroom].” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 4, at 83.  \nOpromalla testified that Captain Fitzpatrick specifically \n“explained that [Public Lewdness] was an ongoing condition and \nthat he wanted [Opromalla] to continue to enforce the laws \nspecifically regarding this condition.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 4, at \n85. However, there is no evidence that Captain Fitzpatrick \nexplicitly mentioned gay men or instructed Opromalla to target \ngay or gender non-conforming men for Public Lewdness arrests. \nPls.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 47.

The \nplaintiffs have sought to introduce evidence regarding \nMartinez v.

Martinez v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. 01-\ncv-721, 2005 WL 2143333, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2005), aff'd, \n445 F.3d 158 (2d Cir. 2006).  In Martinez, the plaintiff was the \nfirst of seven men arrested for Public Lewdness within a 2.5-\nhour period by PAPD officers. Id. at *5.

Ex. \n4, at 293. Capitan Fitzpatrick stated that it “was suggested \nmaybe to take Opromalla out of plainclothes.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. \n9, at 105.  Captain Fitzpatrick testified that, to the degree he \nremembers anything about his response to the New York Times \narticle, it was instructing Officers: “If you see probabl[e] \ncause for arrest, no matter what it is, make the arrest.” Id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 17 of 48\nII.  \nThe standard to be applied to a motion for summary judgment \nis well-established.  Courts are instructed to grant a motion \nfor “summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); \nsee also Celotex Corp. v. Cartrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).3 \n“[T]he trial court's task at the summary judgment motion stage \nof the litigation is carefully limited to discerning whether \nthere are any genuine issues of material fact to be tried, not \nto deciding them.” Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. \nP’ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir. 1994). The Court’s “duty, in \nshort, is confined at this point to issue-finding,” and “does \nnot extend to issue-resolution.” Id.  \nThe moving party bears the initial burden of “informing the \ndistrict court of the basis for its motion” and identifying the \nmatter that “it believes demonstrate[s] the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact.” Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The \nsubstantive law governing the case will identify those facts \nthat are material and “[o]nly disputes over facts that might \naffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will \n \n3 \nUnless otherwise noted, this Opinion and Order omits all alterations, \n \nomissions, emphasis, quotation marks, and citations in quoted text.\n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 18 of 48\nproperly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nIn determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, a \ncourt must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable \ninferences against the moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. \nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). “Summary \njudgment should be denied if, when the party against whom \nsummary judgment is sought is given the benefit of all \npermissible inferences and all credibility assessments, a \nrational factfinder could resolve all material factual issues in \nfavor of that party.” Soto v. Gaudett, 862 F.3d 148, 157 (2d \nCir. 2017). If the moving party meets its burden, the nonmoving \nparty must produce evidence in the record and “may not rely \nsimply on conclusory statements or on contentions that the \naffidavits supporting the motion are not credible.” Ying Jing \nGan v. City of New York, 996 F.2d 522, 532 (2d Cir. 1993).  \nIII.  \nThe defendants have moved for summary judgment on the \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims against the Port Authority, \nbased on the alleged violation of the plaintiffs’ rights under \nthe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to \nestablish either a policy or custom of unconstitutional conduct \nor that the Port Authority’s training and supervision are \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 19 of 48\nconstitutionally inadequate. The defendants primarily contend \nthat the plaintiffs cannot establish that the Port Authority had \nan unconstitutional policy, custom, or practice without a \ncertified class, and that the plaintiffs have failed to allege \nmore than a “single incident,” which is insufficient as a matter \nof law, to support municipal liability for a Section 1983 claim.  \nBoth arguments are without merit. \nThe Port Authority is treated as a municipal entity for \npurposes of Section 1983 liability. Mack v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & \nN.J., 225 F. Supp. 2d 376, 382 & n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). \n“[M]unicipalities may be sued directly under [Section] 1983 for \nconstitutional deprivations inflicted upon private individuals \npursuant to a governmental custom, policy, ordinance, \n,\nregulation, or decision.” Batista v. Rodriguez  702 F.2d 393, \n,\n397 (2d Cir. 1983) (citing Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.  436 \nU.S. 658, 690–91 (1978)). Under Monell and its progeny, \nmunicipalities are subject to liability for Section 1983 claims, \n,\nnot under a theory of respondeat superior  but rather on the \nbasis that their policies or customs inflicted the alleged \ninjuries. Id.  \nTo hold a municipality liable under Section 1983 for the \nunconstitutional actions of its employees, a plaintiff is \nrequired to plead and prove three elements: (1) the existence of \nan official policy or custom that (2) causes the plaintiff to be \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 20 of 48\n,\nsubjected to (3) a denial of a constitutional right. Batista  \n; \n702 F.2d at 397 Bertuglia v. City of New York, 133 F. Supp. 3d \n608, 649 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), aff'd sub nom. Bertuglia v. Schaffler, \n672 F. App'x 96 (2d Cir. 2016). The plaintiff may show the \nexistence of such a policy or custom by identifying any of the \nfollowing: (1) an express policy or custom; (2) an authorization \nof a policymaker of the unconstitutional practice; (3) failure \nof the municipality to train its employees, which exhibits a \n“deliberate indifference” to the rights of its citizens; or (4) \na practice of the municipal employees that is “so permanent and \nwell settled as to imply the constructive acquiescence of senior \npolicymaking officials.” Corley v. Vance, 365 F. Supp. 3d 407, \n438 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), aff'd sub nom., Corley v. Wittner, 811 F. \nApp'x 62 (2d Cir. 2020). \nIn this case, the plaintiffs have primarily sought to \nestablish that the Port Authority failed to train, supervise, or \ndiscipline PAPD officers, thereby allowing unconstitutional \npolicing practices to occur and continue.  \nTo plead a Monell claim based on a failure to train, a \nplaintiff must plead (1) that “a policymaker [of the \nmunicipality] knows ‘to a moral certainty’ that her employees \nwill confront a given situation,” (2) “that the situation either \npresents the employee with a difficult choice of the sort that \ntraining or supervision will make less difficult or that there \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 21 of 48\nis a history of employees mishandling the situation,” and (3) \n“that the wrong choice by the city employee will frequently \ncause the deprivation of a citizen’s constitutional rights.” \n,\nWalker v. City of New York  974 F.2d 293, 297–98 (2d Cir. 1992). \nA municipality is deliberately indifferent where it fails to act \nwhen it has “actual or constructive notice,” generally from “[a] \npattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained \nemployees,” that its training program is “deficient.” \nHernandez v. United States, 939 F.3d 191, 207 (2d Cir. 2019). A \nplaintiff, therefore, “must demonstrate that the municipal \naction was taken with deliberate indifference as to its known or \nobvious consequences.” Id. As the Supreme Court explained in \n,\nConnick v. Thompson  a “pattern of similar constitutional \nviolations by untrained employees is ‘ordinarily necessary’ to \ndemonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of a failure to \ntrain.” 563 U.S. 51, 62 (2011). \nThe plaintiffs have presented evidence that there are \ngenuine issues of material fact as to whether the PAPD \nadequately trained its plainclothes officers to avoid arresting \nmen without probable cause, while conducting plainclothes \npolicing patrols of bathrooms, or to avoid bias regarding sexual \norientation and gender presentation. There are genuine issues of \nmaterial fact regarding whether PAPD officers were instructed to \nemphasize arrests for “Quality of Life” issues, whether Officers \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 22 of 48\nwere given sufficient instruction as to what constituted such \n“Quality of Life” issues, and whether these policy choices \ncaused officers to target certain individuals, based on their \nperceived sexual orientation or gender presentation.  \nFor municipal liability based on a failure to supervise, \n“the municipality may be held liable for a subsequent violation \nif the superior's inaction amounts to deliberate indifference or \nto tacit authorization of the offensive acts,” after the \nsupervisor has notice of past violations. Turpin v. Mailet, 619 \nF.2d 196, 201 (2d Cir. 1980). However, under this theory of \nMonell liability, “even if a policy can be inferred from \nomissions of a municipality, such as where it acquiesces in a \npattern of illegal conduct, such a policy cannot be inferred \nfrom the failure of those in charge to discipline a single \npolice officer for a single incident of illegality”; instead, \nthere must be “more evidence of supervisory indifference, such \nas acquiescence in a prior pattern of conduct.” Lucente v. \nCounty of Suffolk, 980 F.3d 284, 306 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting \nTurpin, 619 F.2d at 201-02). \nIn this case, the plaintiffs have alleged and proffered \nevidence to establish that the PAPD officers engaged in a \npattern of policing specifically targeting men perceived as gay, \nbisexual, or otherwise gender non-conforming for arrest without \nprobable cause on charges for Public Lewdness after using the \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 23 of 48\nPABT men’s restrooms. The plaintiffs have alleged that the PAPD \nundertook a policy or custom of policing for “Quality of Life” \nissues, using inadequately trained and supervised plainclothes \npolice officers, with deliberate indifference to the potential \nfor unconstitutional search, seizure, and arrests without \nprobable cause, potentially based on impermissible bases. To \nsupport their case, the plaintiffs point to the “idiosyncratic” \nuptick in 2014 Public Lewdness arrests in connection with \nplainclothes police patrols of men’s bathrooms, evidence that \nsuggests the PAPD engaged in occasional “Quality of Life \nsweeps,” the nearly identical language used in the plaintiffs’ \nCCRs to describe the alleged behavior of the arrestee, an e-mail \nlisting the arrest of four men under similar circumstances \nwithin 48 hours as an “achievement,” and alleged inadequacies in \nthe training of the Officer Defendants. There are also plainly \ncredibility determinations required to settle conflicting \ntestimony regarding the plaintiffs’ arrests. \nIn sum, considering the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have presented \nsufficient evidence such that a reasonable factfinder could find \nthat the PAPD failed to train or to supervise and discipline \nplainclothes officers, despite awareness of past issues, that \nthis failure was done with deliberate indifference to the \nconsequences, and that this failure to train or to supervise and \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 24 of 48\ndiscipline was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs being \nunlawfully subjected to arrest without probable cause and to \narrest in violation of their rights to equal protection.   \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot maintain \ntheir Section 1983 claims without having been certified as a \nclass, citing to Chin v. Port Auth. of N.Y. and N.J., 685 F.3d \n135, 150 (2d Cir. 2012).  However, Chin was a case involving a \nprivate plaintiff seeking to bring an employment discrimination \nclaim under Title VII, based on a theory that the employer had \nengaged in a “pattern or practice” of discrimination.  The Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit, based on the text of Title \nVII and Supreme Court precedent, determined that the “pattern or \npractice” method of proving a Title VII claim was not available \nto private litigants outside of the class action context. Id. at \n149.  As such, the passage cited and the reasoning of Chin are \nirrelevant to the Section 1983 claims at issue here, because the \nChin court was exclusively focused on Title VII and the way in \nwhich private plaintiffs could pursue a “pattern or practice” \nclaim under that statute.  That case has no relevance to the \nefforts by private plaintiffs to establish Monell liability. \nIndeed, in the Section 1983 context, courts have routinely \npermitted claims against municipalities brought by individual \nplaintiffs that can establish the existence of a municipal \npolicy, without the certification of a class.  See, e.g., \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 25 of 48\nLucente, 980 F.3d at 308-310 (finding three plaintiffs had \nestablished sufficient issues of material fact to preclude \nsummary judgment on municipality’s indifference to pattern of \nsexual assaults and harassment of female inmates). \nSecond, the defendants argue that a plaintiff must show a \n“pattern” of similar constitutional violations, that \npolicymakers had “notice” of the potential for constitutional \nviolations absent adequate training or supervision, and that the \nplaintiffs have failed to demonstrate either.  The defendants \nassert that the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to establish that the other 2014 “Public Lewdness” \narrests were made without probable cause or involved persons \ntargeted because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender \npresentation.  \nHowever, the plaintiffs have introduced expert testimony to \nsupport their claim that the plaintiffs’ arrests were part of a \nnotable and “idiosyncratic” pattern of arrests with historical \nroots connected to law enforcement Public Lewdness arrests in \nmen’s bathrooms. Accordingly, there are genuine issues of \nmaterial fact as to whether a “pattern” of similar violations \noccurred, such that a reasonable jury could conclude that the \nalleged false arrests of Holden and Mejia were not mere isolated \nincidents. See, e.g., Lucente, 980 F.3d at 309-10; Cordero v. \nCity of New York, 282 F. Supp. 3d 549, 565 (E.D.N.Y. 2017).  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 26 of 48\nFurther, with regard to the “notice” requirement for the \nplaintiffs’ claims regarding the PAPD’s failure to train – the \n2004 jury verdict in Martinez case, 2005 district court \ndecision, and subsequent affirmance by the Court of Appeals, \nshould have provided PAPD officials with sufficient notice of \nthe real potential for constitutional violations that could \narise when police officers in plain clothes undertake arrests in \nmen’s bathrooms and the potential for invidious discrimination \nbased on perceived sexual orientation or gender presentation.  \nThe plaintiffs allege that the PAPD has failed to update its \ntraining, which features outdated terminology and no practical \ninstructions, despite the constitutional violations for which \nthe PAPD was previously found liable. The defendants’ argument \nthat Martinez is too remote or dissimilar from the plaintiffs’ \nclaims here to provide sufficient notice to PAPD management is \nunpersuasive.  Martinez may be too remote to be probative for \nany of the individual Officer Defendants who were not involved \nin the arrests at issue in Martinez.  However, the incidents at \nissue in Martinez and present here are similar—and a reasonable \njury could find that the PAPD’s failure to update its training \nmaterials after Martinez amounted to an unconstitutional failure \nto train, sufficient to subject the PAPD to liability for the \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 27 of 48\nFurther, the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the \nPAPD engaged in a plainclothes policing initiative without \nadequate supervision of the officers involved. At a minimum, the \ndiscrepancies in the testimony of PAPD officers, regarding \nwhether “Public Lewdness” or “Exposure of a Person” were \n“Quality of Life” issues or appropriate targets for plainclothes \npolicing, underscore that there are triable issues of fact as to \nwhether the PAPD supervision regarding bias and constitutional \nrestrictions on plainclothes policies was unconstitutionally \ndeficient. Pls.’ 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 11; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 2, at 94; \nEx. 4, at 84; Ex. 9, at 63; Ex. 10, at 145-46; Brophy Decl. Ex. \nF, at 104, 106; Brophy Reply Decl. Ex. EE, at 78, 183. \nBecause there are disputed issues of material facts with \nregard to the existence of a “pattern,” and whether plainclothes \nofficers were adequately trained and supervised, the issue of \nMonell liability should be decided by the jury on the theory of \na failure to train or supervise. \nIV. \nThe defendants have moved for summary judgment on the \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims based on alleged violations of \nthe plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, arguing that the Officer Defendants are \nentitled to qualified immunity and, in the alternative, that the \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 28 of 48\nplaintiffs’ equal protection claims lack sufficient factual \nsupport.  \nA. \nQualified immunity protects government officials performing \ndiscretionary functions, such as arrests, “from liability for \ncivil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly \nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a \nreasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 \nU.S. 800, 818 (1982); see also Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. \n2012, 2023 (2014). The Supreme Court has instructed that courts \nshould generally follow a two-step inquiry when an official \nraises a qualified immunity defense: first determine whether \n“the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,” and \nthen determine if “the right was ‘clearly established’ at the \ntime of the challenged conduct.” Ricciuti v. Gyzenis, 834 F.3d \n162, 167 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. \n731, 735 (2011)).  \nFor the second prong of the inquiry, “[t]he dispositive \nquestion is whether the violative nature of particular conduct \nis clearly established,” and, “must be undertaken in light of \nthe specific context of the case, not as a broad general \nproposition.” Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015). The \n“clearly established right . . . must be defined with \nspecificity.” City of Escondido v. Emmons, 139 S. Ct. 500, 503 \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 29 of 48\n(2019). For a right to be clearly established “do[es] not \nrequire a case directly on point, but existing precedent must \nhave placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond \ndebate.” al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741. In determining whether a \nright is clearly established at the time of the conduct in \nquestion, courts can consider Supreme Court decisions, decisions \nof the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and “a consensus of \ncases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer \ncould not have believed that his actions were lawful.” Wilson v. \nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999). In addition, in this Circuit, \ngenuine, material disputes on factual issues that are relevant \nto the qualified immunity analysis are to be put to the jury to \nbe decided through special interrogatories. Warren v. Dwyer, 906 \nF.2d 70, 76 (2d Cir. 1990); see also Jones v. Treubig, 963 F.3d \n214, 225 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThe defendants assert that “neither the Second Circuit nor \nthe Supreme Court have held the Equal Protection Clause \nprohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nnon-conformity,” and thus such principle was not “clearly \nestablished” in 2014 at the time of the plaintiffs’ arrests.  \nThis assertion misstates the law.  \nFirst, the defendants’ claim that the Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit has not held that adverse discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or gender non-conformity is \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 30 of 48\nprohibited by the Equal Protection Clause is untrue. In 2012, \nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Windsor held that \nhomosexuality is a “quasi-suspect” class and discriminatory \ntreatment of the class is subject to “intermediate judicial \nreview.” Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 185 (2d Cir. \n2012), aff'd on other grounds, 570 U.S. 744 (2013). Courts in \nthe Second Circuit have repeatedly recognized Windsor’s \napplication of intermediate scrutiny to sexual orientation-based \nclassifications as the controlling law within this Circuit, \ndating back to before the relevant plaintiffs’ arrests in 2014. \nSee, e.g., Morgan v. Semple, No. 16-cv-225, 2020 WL 2198117, at \n*19 (D. Conn. May 6, 2020); Adkins v. City of New York, 143 F. \nSupp. 3d 134, 139 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Toliver v. Fischer, No. 12-\ncv-0077, 2015 WL 403133, at *20 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2015); \nWeslowski v. Zugibe, 14 F. Supp. 3d 295, 318 & n.7 (S.D.N.Y. \n2014) (on March 31, 2014, stating “the Second Circuit has held \nthat ‘homosexuals compose a class that is . . . quasi-suspect,’” \nand that allegations of discrimination involving this class are \n \n“subject to heightened scrutiny.”). \nMoreover, whatever the level of scrutiny, it is clear \nbeyond dispute–and was clear in 2014-that there is no basis to \narrest people based on their sexual orientation. The plaintiffs \nhave plausibly alleged and provided support for the proposition \nthat the PAPD engaged in a de facto policy of discriminatory \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 31 of 48\npolicing that specifically targeted for arrest homosexual or \ngender non-conforming men.  The plaintiffs have further alleged \na failure to train officers, despite previous well-documented \nfailings in the past.  In combination, the plaintiffs have \nalleged the very policy decisions that the Supreme Court has \nlong recognized serve no legitimate government interest and are \ninsufficient to satisfy even rational basis review under the \n,\nEqual Protection Clause. See, e.g., Romer v. Evans  517 U.S. \n620, 634–35 (1996). Cf. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 584, \n(2003) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“[T]he State cannot single \nout one identifiable class of citizens for punishment that does \nnot apply to everyone else, with moral disapproval as the only \nasserted state interest for the law.”). Indeed, long before \nWindsor, courts in this Circuit have recognized that government \ndiscrimination based on “[s]exual orientation has been held to \nbe a basis for an equal protection claim under Section 1983.” \n,\nEmblen v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J.  No. 00-cv-8877, 2002 WL \n498634, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2002); Quinn v. Nassau County \n,\nPolice Dep't  53 F. Supp. 2d 347, 356–57 (E.D.N.Y. 1999); Tester \n,\nv. City of New York  No. 95-cv-7972, 1997 WL 81662 at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 1997).  Furthermore, courts have recognized \nthat discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation can be \nsufficient to violate a plaintiff’s rights under the Equal \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 32 of 48\nProtection Clause, even if the plaintiff is not actually a \nmember of the class. See Emblen, 2002 WL 498634, at *7.  \nFinally, given that anti-homosexual bias was one of the \ntheories that provided the basis of the Martinez case’s jury \nverdict, Defs.’ 56.1 Resp. Stmt. ¶ 5, the specific rights at \nissue—not to be targeted for search, seizure, and arrest without \nprobable cause, based on perceived sexual orientation or \nnonheteronormative gender presentation–were plainly “clearly \nestablished” with sufficient specificity.  \nTo support their assertion, the defendants cite to dicta in \nan employment discrimination case from 2010, involving events \noccurring before 2008. Flaherty v. Massapequa Pub. Sch., 752 F. \nSupp. 2d 286, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 2010), aff'd, 462 F. App'x 38 (2d \nCir. 2012). First, although the Flaherty Court noted that the \narea of law “remains somewhat unsettled” and rested its opinion \non other grounds, the Court noted that “it is likely that a \nperson perceived as homosexual is in a protected class for equal \nprotection purposes.” Id. Moreover, given that the Second \nCircuit’s decision in Windsor was issued in 2012 and affirmed in \n2013, the Flaherty case offers no support for the defendants.   \nThe defendants also seek to rely on the decision of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals in Naumovski v. Norris, which \nfound individual officials were entitled to qualified immunity \nfor a claim of employment discrimination in violation of the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 33 of 48\nEqual Protection Clause, on the basis of sexual orientation \narising from conduct that occurred between 2008-2010. 934 F.3d \n200, 207-09 (2d Cir. 2019). Naumovski involved a single \nplaintiff, who brought an employment discrimination suit in \n2011, prior to the decision in Windsor, and who made and then \nappeared to abandon the argument that she was discriminated \nagainst on the basis of sexual orientation. Naumovski, 934 F.3d \nat 218 & n.66. The Naumovski court explained that qualified \nimmunity applied to the officials in that case because when the \nalleged conduct occurred, Windsor had not yet been affirmed by \nthe Supreme Court. Accordingly, at that time “[i]t was, \ntherefore, not yet clear that all state distinctions based on \nsexual orientation were constitutionally suspect.” Id. at 219.  \nBy contrast, the events here all took place after the \ndecision of the Court of Appeals in Windsor and after it was \naffirmed by the Supreme Court and the plaintiffs here have \nalleged animus and systemic discrimination. Therefore, the \nindividual Officer Defendants are not entitled to qualified \nimmunity for the plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause claims. \nB. \nIn the alternative, the defendants argue that the \nplaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause claim lacks factual support.  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate that the arresting officers were aware of the \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 34 of 48\nplaintiffs’ sexual orientation or gender nonconformity, or that \nthe plaintiffs were intentionally discriminated against or \ntreated worse than “similarly situated” individuals.   \nTo prevail on a claim of selective enforcement, the \nplaintiffs must show (1) that they were treated differently from \nother similarly situated individuals, and (2) that such \ndifferential treatment was based on “‘impermissible \nconsiderations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or \npunish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or \nbad faith intent to injure a person.’” Harlen Assocs. v. \n,\nIncorporated Vill. of Mineola  273 F.3d 494, 499 (2d Cir. 2001).  \nHere, the plaintiffs have alleged that defendants violated \ntheir rights to equal protection when the plaintiffs were \nsubjected to arrest without probable cause, which the plaintiffs \nallege was the result of a deliberate targeting of gay or gender \nnon-conforming men by the PAPD officers.  The plaintiffs have \npresented evidence to show that the population of lewdness \narrests that occurred in the men’s bathroom during 2014, of \nwhich the plaintiffs’ arrests are a part, were “idiosyncratic,” \noccurred at counterintuitive times, and do not match the age or \nracial characteristics of those arrested for other offenses, and \nthat the arrests were likely driven by “intentional policy \nchoices,” and “not incidental to routine police patrols and \nstops.” Spitzer Decl. Ex. 12, at 9. The plaintiffs have \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 35 of 48\npresented evidence to suggest there is a history in New York of \npolicing men’s bathrooms in order to target gay or gender non-\nconforming men, and that the idiosyncratic arrests in 2014 were \npart of that pattern. Id., Ex. 11 ¶¶ 7-9. Moreover, if credited, \nthe plaintiffs’ testimony about the way they were allegedly \ntargeted in the bathroom although they were not engaged in any \nunlawful activity, combined with the evidence of their allegedly \ngender non-conforming dress, could support an inference that \nthey were singled out because of their perceived sexual \norientation or gender presentation and not for any legitimate \nreason. Defs.’ 51.6 Stmt. ¶ 15; Spitzer Decl. Ex. 15, at 125-36; \nEx. 16 at 126-27.  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have both failed \nto show the arresting officers knew of the plaintiffs’ sexual \norientation or gender non-conformity. The defendants argue that \nthe plaintiffs have only pleaded subjective “feelings” or \n“perceptions” of being discriminated against because of their \nsexual orientation. But the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged \nthat their sexual orientation or gender non-conformity was \napparent from their appearance, and, if their testimony is \ncredited, in light of the circumstances of their arrests, a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude that the arresting \nofficers’ behavior within the bathroom suggests an attempt to \ntarget based on those apparent characteristics. As such, the \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 36 of 48\ndefendants’ arguments that the plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate they were treated worse than “similarly situated” \nindividuals are unpersuasive. The plaintiffs have presented \nsufficient evidence such that a reasonable factfinder could \nconclude that the plaintiffs were treated differently from other \nPABT patrons in violation of their right to equal protection, \nand that such differential treatment was related to an \nimpermissible consideration of their real or perceived sexual \norientation.  \nMoreover, the question of whether the arresting officers \nwere aware of the plaintiffs’ sexual orientation is a question \nof fact that depends on an assessment of all the facts and that \ncannot be resolved in the defendants’ favor on a motion for \n,\nsummary judgment. McClellan v. Smith  439 F.3d 137, 148 (2d Cir. \n2006) (“Resolutions of credibility conflicts and choices between \nconflicting versions of the facts are matters for the jury, not \nfor the court on summary judgment.”) (quoting United States v. \nRem, 38 F.3d 634, 644 (2d Cir. 1994)); cf. Savino v. Town of \nSe., 983 F. Supp. 2d 293, 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)  (conflicting \ntestimony demonstrated genuine issues of material fact existed \nfor selective enforcement claim based on national origin), \naff'd, 572 F. App'x 15 (2d Cir. 2014); Greenidge v. Costco \nWholesale, No. 09-cv-4224, 2012 WL 1077455, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. \n30, 2012) (genuine dispute over material facts existed because \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 37 of 48\nof conflicting testimony regarding whether defendants were aware \nof plaintiff’s pregnancy prior to her termination). \nFinally, the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence \nfrom which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the Port \nAuthority both had a de facto policy that caused the targeting \nof gay or gender non-conforming men with unconstitutional police \ntactics and failed to train and supervise its officers \nappropriately.  \nV. \n  The defendants have moved for summary judgment on \nplaintiffs’ Section 1983 claims against Officer Defendants \nKehoe, Esposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, O’Dell, and \nFitzpatrick, arguing that such claims are without legal or \nfactual support and, because they were not raised in the initial \ncomplaint, they are time barred.  The plaintiffs argue that each \nof the non-arresting officers failed to ensure that the \narresting officers had established necessary probable cause for \nthe arrest of both plaintiffs and failed to supervise \nappropriately the plain-clothes policing tactics used in the \nPABT bathrooms. Further, the plaintiffs note that Captain \nFitzpatrick, as the Commanding Officer, in particular, appears \nto have had a significant role in deciding and implementing the \nPAPD’s official policies and strategic initiatives, including \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 38 of 48\nthe TPU and the alleged use of plainclothes officers to conduct \n“Quality of Life” arrests.   \nA. \n  The plaintiffs’ claims against the non-arresting Officer \nDefendants are time-barred.  The Court of Appeals has concluded \nthat Section 1983 claims based on events that occurred within \nNew York State have 3-year statute of limitations. Hogan v. \nFischer, 738 F.3d 509, 517 (2d Cir. 2013); Berman v. Perez, No. \n17-cv-2757, 2018 WL 565269, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2018). \nGenerally, “‘John Doe’ pleadings cannot be used to circumvent \nstatutes of limitations because replacing a ‘John Doe’ with a \nnamed party in effect constitutes a change in the party sued.” \nHogan, 738 F.3d at 517. As such, John Doe substitutions may \ngenerally only occur after the statute of limitations has \npassed, if the claims relate back to the original complaint and \nthe requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) are met. Id. The \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals has also recognized that Rule \n15(c)(1)(A) permits certain plaintiffs to take advantage of the \nmore lenient New York State relation-back standard for \nsubstituting unknown defendants under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 1024.  \nUnder that standard, a claim against a John Doe defendant is \ntimely if (1) the plaintiff “exercise[d] due diligence, prior to \nthe running of the statute of limitations, to identify the \ndefendant by name,” and (2) the party described the John Doe \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 39 of 48\nparty “in such form as will fairly apprise the party that [he] \nis the intended defendant.” Hogan, 738 F.3d at 519.  \nIn this case, the events occurred in May and July of 2014, \nand the plaintiffs’ original complaint was filed on March 27, \n2017, and named only Officers Opromalla, Tone, and Kehoe.  It \ndid not include Captain Fitzpatrick, even though Captain \nFitzpatrick was quoted in the New York Times article that the \nplaintiffs’ attached as an exhibit to the original complaint.  \nThe defendants note that the CCRs, which were provided on July \n6, 2017, as part of the Rule 26 disclosures, provided the names \nof Esposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, Cruz, and O’Dell.  \nNevertheless, the plaintiffs did not file a First Amended \nComplaint, adding Esposito, DeMartino, and Aylmer, until three \nmonths later on October 6, 2017, and did not file the Second \nAmended Complaint, adding Miller, Cruz, and O’Dell, until \nNovember 28, 2018.   \nThe claims against Captain Fitzpatrick are time-barred.  He \nwas known to the plaintiffs at the time they filed their First \nAmended Complaint, because he was quoted in the New York Times \narticle attached to their original complaint, and they chose not \nto sue him.  The plaintiffs failed to bring their claims against \nhim within the statute of limitations period, and the plaintiffs \ncannot rely on New York’s more lenient relation-back standard. \nLiverpool v. Davis, 442 F. Supp. 3d 714, 726 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 40 of 48\n(plaintiffs “failure to mention” a known defendant was “not the \ntype of mistake contemplated by New York's relation-back rule”); \nsee also Maurro v. Lederman, 795 N.Y.S.2d 867, 870 (Sup. Ct. \n2005) (“An explicit prerequisite to the use of C.P.L.R. § 1024 \nis plaintiff's ignorance of the defendant's name.”). \nThe plaintiffs also cannot rely on the more lenient \nstandard of C.P.L.R. § 1024 for their claims against defendants \nEsposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, Cruz, and O’Dell, because \nthe allegations in the original complaint against the John Doe \ndefendants were so general that they did not provide notice to \nthose defendants that they were intended defendants in this \nlawsuit.   \nB. \nThe plaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate a sufficient \nfactual basis for their claims against the Officer Defendants, \nother than Officers Opromalla and Tone.   \nThe plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient support \nfor their claims against Officer Kehoe. Although Officer Kehoe \nwas present for both plaintiffs’ arrests, the parties agree that \nOfficer Kehoe was standing outside the bathroom while Officers \nTone and Opromalla went into the bathroom and that Officers Tone \nand Opromalla prepared the plaintiffs’ respective arrest \npaperwork. In Mejia’s case, Mejia does not appear to allege that \nOfficer Kehoe was the alleged “short” plainclothes officer who \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 41 of 48\n“smirked” at him, and Officer Tone was the only officer to \ntestify at Mejia’s trial. The plaintiffs note that Officer Kehoe \nwas among the five officers responsible for the majority of the \nPublic Lewdness arrests in 2014, Spitzer Decl. Ex. 12 ¶ 32, but \nthere is no evidence in the record to establish a genuine issue \nregarding whether Officer Kehoe had reason to disbelieve the \ndescription of the plaintiffs’ conduct given by Officers Tone \nand Opromalla.  The Court of Appeals has instructed that for \npurposes of making a probable cause determination, police \nofficers are entitled to rely on the allegations of fellow \npolice officers. Martinez v. Simonetti, 202 F.3d 625, 634 (2d \nCir. 2000); Bernard v. United States, 25 F.3d 98, 102–03 (2d \nCir. 1994). As such, there are no genuine issues regarding \nOfficer Kehoe’s personal involvement in the plaintiffs’ alleged \nfalse arrests, because Officer Kehoe’s mere presence at the \nscene is not a sufficient factual basis to establish liability. \nMinter v. City Of Westchester, No. 08-cv-7726, 2011 WL 856269 at \n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 20, 2011).  \n  The plaintiffs have similarly failed to demonstrate a \nsufficient factual basis for their claims against the remaining \nnon-arresting Officer Defendants, who served in supervisory \ncapacities: Esposito, DeMartino, Aylmer, Miller, O’Dell, and \nFitzpatrick.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 42 of 48\nPrior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662 (2009), within the Second Circuit, “the personal \ninvolvement of a supervisory defendant [could have been] shown \nby evidence that: (1) the defendant participated directly in the \nalleged constitutional violation, (2) the defendant, after being \ninformed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed to \nremedy the wrong, (3) the defendant created a policy or custom \nunder which unconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed the \ncontinuance of such a policy or custom, (4) the defendant was \ngrossly negligent in supervising subordinates who committed the \nwrongful acts, or (5) the defendant exhibited deliberate \nindifference to the rights of [plaintiffs] by failing to act on \ninformation indicating that unconstitutional acts were \noccurring.” Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995). \nAfter Iqbal, there was considerable uncertainty as to whether \neach of the five Colon factors remained a sufficient basis for \nestablishing individual liability for supervisors. See \nReynolds v. Barrett, 685 F.3d 193, 205 & n.14 (2d Cir. 2012); \nCompare Brandon v. Kinter, 938 F.3d 21, 36 (2d Cir. 2019) \n(applying Colon factors without caveats), with Lombardo v. \nGraham, 807 F. App'x 120, 124 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2020) (noting that \nthe Court need not reach the issue of whether all five Colon \nfactors remain sufficient bases for liability). But the Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit has recently emphasized that \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 43 of 48\n“there is no special rule for supervisory liability,” after \nIqbal, and thus, a “plaintiff must plead that each Government-\nofficial defendant, through the official’s own individual \nactions, has violated the Constitution.” Tangreti v. Bachmann, \n983 F.3d 609, 616 (2d Cir. 2020).  The plaintiffs cannot rely \n“on a separate test of liability specific to supervisors.” Id. \nat 619. \nHere, the plaintiffs’ briefs appear to assert that the \nsupervisory Officer Defendants individually participated through \ntheir failure to ensure that sufficient probable cause existed \nfor the plaintiffs’ arrest and for failing to supervise the \nplainclothes officers’ policing of the PABT bathrooms and \nfailing to ensure that arrests were not made based on \nimpermissible bias.   \nHowever, the plaintiffs have failed to establish a \nsufficient basis for finding Lt. Aylmer, Sgt. DeMartino, Sgt. \nEsposito, Lt. O’Dell, and Sgt. Miller’s own individual actions \nin connection with their review of post-arrest paperwork \nviolated the Constitution.  The plaintiffs have not alleged that \nthese officers had knowledge of the arrests before they \noccurred, and their involvement was solely in connection with \nthe post-arrest paperwork. But officers are “entitled to rely on \nthe allegations of fellow police officers” who were present “at \nthe scene.” See, e.g., Martinez v. Simonetti, 202 F.3d 625, 634-\n43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 44 of 48\n35 (2d Cir. 2000).  The plaintiffs have presented no evidence \nthat Lt. Aylmer, Sgt. DeMartino, Sgt. Esposito, Lt. O’Dell, or \nSgt. Miller had any reason to know that Officers Tone or \nOpromalla did not have probable cause for the arrests at the \ntime.  Both Officers Opromalla and Tone have admitted both to \nmaking the arrests and completing the arrest paperwork, and \nthere is no evidence in the record to suggest genuine issues of \nfact regarding whether the supervising officers personally \nparticipated in making arrests without probable cause or \nfalsifying arrest records.  \n  Similarly, the plaintiffs argue that Captain Fitzpatrick is \npersonally responsible for establishing a policy and practice \nof, among other things, emphasizing “Public Lewdness” and \n“Quality of Life” crimes, failing to supervise officers under \nhis command, and for directing Officer Opromalla to “continue to \nenforce” Public Lewdness laws while assigned to plainclothes \npolicing.  At best, plaintiffs have presented evidence \nsuggesting Captain Fitzpatrick was indifferent to the risks of \nunconstitutional false arrests or equal protection violations, \ncaused by the combination of the officers’ lack of adequate \ntraining, and his alleged emphasis on policing Public Lewdness.  \nBut there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that \nCaptain Fitzpatrick was personally involved in the arrests of \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 45 of 48\nthe plaintiffs with an awareness that the arrests were made \nwithout probable cause or based on an impermissible bias.  \nThus, the plaintiffs have failed to adduce sufficient \nevidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the \nnon-arresting officers were personally involved in any \nconstitutional violations.   \nVI. \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ general \nallegations that their rights to “due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment” were violated because they were targeted \nbased on their perceived sexual orientation or gender non-\nconformity fail to state a claim.  The defendants further assert \nthat the plaintiffs’ claims that their liberty interests in \nprivacy were violated by the defendants’ actions are not \ncognizable.  The defendants have also contended that-to the \nextent that the plaintiffs allege unlawful entrapment-such an \nallegation is not an independent ground for civil liability.  \nTo state a claim for a violation of a plaintiff’s \nsubstantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, a \nplaintiff must allege some valid liberty or property interest, \nupon which the defendants infringed. Harlen Assocs., 273 F.3d at \n503.  While the Supreme Court has recognized that the Due \nProcess Clause protects certain substantive liberty interests in \nprivacy and bodily integrity, the plaintiffs here are not \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 46 of 48\nchallenging the Public Lewdness statute as being \nunconstitutionally vague or otherwise facially invalid and are \ninstead only challenging its specific application to their \nalleged unlawful search, seizure, and false arrest without \nprobable cause.  As a result, the plaintiffs’ due process \nallegations in their complaint sound in the Fourth Amendment’s \nprohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. When \nfaced with similar claims, courts in this Circuit have been \ninstructed that the Fourth Amendment, rather than Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process clause, should serve as the “guide for \nanalyzing these claims,” given the more “explicit textual source \nof constitutional protection.” Russo v. City of Bridgeport, 479 \nF.3d 196, 209 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. \n386, 395 (1989)); Lauro v. Charles, 219 F.3d 202, 208 (2d Cir. \n2000); Abreu v. City of New York, No. 17-cv-6179, 2018 WL \n3315572, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2018); Ambrose v. City of New \nYork, 623 F. Supp. 2d 454, 474 & n.9 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).  \nAlthough the plaintiffs stated at oral argument that they \nintend to pursue their substantive due process claims, their \nbrief only discusses invasion of privacy in the context of the \nalleged violations of their Fourth Amendment rights. \nNext, as the plaintiffs correctly note, their Second \nAmended Complaint does not include a standalone “entrapment” \nclaim, and thus, the defendants’ arguments that entrapment is \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 47 of 48\nnot an independent ground for liability under Section 1983 are \nirrelevant.  \nTherefore, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment \ndismissing the plaintiffs’ claims based on alleged violations of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \nVII.  \n  The defendants assert that neither the Port Authority nor \nthe PAPD can be held liable for punitive damages. Although the \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit has not addressed the \nquestion, other courts in this district have applied to the Port \nAuthority the Supreme Court’s reasoning in City of Newport v. \nFact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 261 (1981), that \nmunicipalities should not be subject to punitive damages. Vernon \nv. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 154 F. Supp. 2d 844, 860 (S.D.N.Y. \n2001) (collecting cases).  While the Port Authority is a self-\nfinancing agency, funded by user fees, the wrongdoing of the \nPort Authority’s officials should not be borne by the public \ngenerally.  The combination of the Port Authority’s liability \nfor compensatory damages and individual officer liability for \nboth compensatory and punitive damages should be sufficient to \nsatisfy the goal of deterrence. Thus, the Court is persuaded to \njoin the majority of courts to have considered the issue and \nfind that the Port Authority—and the PAPD as one of its \nconstituent agencies—is immune from punitive damages. See \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 256   Filed 02/22/21   Page 48 of 48\nEvans v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 273 F.3d 346, 357 (3d Cir. \n2001); Ryduchowski v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. 96-cv-5589, \n1998 WL 812633, at *15 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 1998). In a letter, \nfiled after oral argument, the plaintiffs have conceded that \npunitive damages are not available against the Port Authority. \nECF No. 249. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court has considered all of the arguments of the \nparties. To the extent not specifically addressed above, the \nremaining arguments are either moot or without merit. For the \nreasons explained above, the defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment is denied in part and granted in part.

This class action seeks declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief to redress the \ndeprivation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.  The tactics \nof Defendant Port Authority Police Department (“P.A.P.D.”) and its officers should not and \nindeed cannot stand.  They are deplorable indicia of a governmental agency that cares not about \nlaw or liberty, choosing to violate both with baseless abandon.  Those tactics evince a policy \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 2 of 47\nand/or pattern and practice of unlawful discrimination, targeting, and false arrests of men using \nPort Authority Bus Terminal (“P.A.B.T”) restrooms.  \n2.  Specifically, Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in response \nto Defendants’ policy and/or pattern and practice of unlawful discrimination, targeting, and false \narrests of men using “P.A.B.T” restrooms.   \n3.  Defendants’ wrongful conduct includes the specific and deliberate targeting by \nP.A.P.D. officers of men that such officers perceive as gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-\nconforming, and/or men who have sex with men, using P.A.B.T. restrooms.   \n4.  P.A.P.D. officers engage in a pattern and practice of targeting and wrongly \narresting men that such officers perceive as gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, \nand/or men who have sex with men, on baseless charges including public lewdness and \nexposure, falsely claiming that they were engaged in illegal conduct at P.A.B.T. restroom \nurinals.   \n5.  P.A.P.D. officers were deliberately targeting men for arrests on the discriminatory \nbasis of actual or perceived sexual orientation, actual or perceived gender expression, and/or to \nboost “quality of life” arrest statistics at P.A.B.T. and/or individual P.A.P.D. officers’ arrest \nstatistics.  P.A.P.D. officers make such arrests knowing or believing that many of those arrested \nwould ultimately be effectively forced to plead guilty to lesser charges such as disorderly \nconduct to avoid the public embarrassment and humiliation, potential jail sentences and fines, \nand potential reputational and professional harm associated with the false charges.  \n6.  The tactics employed by P.A.P.D. officers to conduct such targeted arrests are an \nexercise in unconstitutional bias.  Some of that conduct was designed to attempt to entice men \nwho are gay or bisexual, and/or men who have sex with men into exposing themselves to men at \n-2- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 3 of 47\nother urinals.  For example, plainclothes P.A.P.D. officers at times pretend to use urinals next to \ntargeted individuals in P.A.B.T. men’s restrooms.  These urinals are separated by privacy walls.  \nSome P.A.P.D. officers proceed to stare at the targeted man while he is using the urinal.  In some \ncases, the officer may actually step back from the urinal in order to see around the privacy wall, \nin an effort to view the targeted man’s hands and genitals.  In others, the officer may \nintentionally expose himself to the man in an effort to entice him to react lewdly.  Based solely \non the officer’s report of his observations, the targeted man is then arrested by a team of \nP.A.P.D. officers when he exits the restroom. \n7.  Upon information and belief, P.A.P.D. officers specifically target men that \nP.A.P.D. officers perceive as gay or bisexual (based on appearance), and/or gender non-\nconforming (a person assigned male at birth wearing what a P.A.P.D. officer believes to be non-\nmasculine attire or jewelry)1, and/or men who have sex with men, for such unlawful and \nunconstitutional treatment.  \n8.  Indeed, following the wrongful arrest of Plaintiff Cornell Holden, Mr. Holden \noverheard P.A.P.D. officers congratulating the arresting officer and explicitly referring to him as \n“the gay whisperer,” presumably because of the arresting officer’s pattern and practice of \narresting men that he perceived as gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, and/or as a \nman who has sex with men.   \n9.  This policy and/or pattern and practice of unlawful and unconstitutional \ndiscriminatory conduct is perpetuated not only by the arresting officers, but also by officers who \nare senior and/or had supervisory duties, such as: supervisors who instructed officers to use such \n                                                 \n1 “Gender non-conforming” is generally defined as relating to a person whose behavior or \nappearance does not conform to prevailing cultural and social expectations about what is \nappropriate to the gender that person was assigned at birth. \n-3- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 4 of 47\ntactics; supervisors who signed off on the arrest paperwork of the targeted individuals without \nsufficiently inquiring about the officer’s probable cause; tour commanders on the shifts during \nwhich the targeted individuals were arrested; and commanding officers who initiated \nplainclothes patrols with officers new to policing without sufficient training or supervision.  \nIndeed, these officers with supervisory duties at a minimum reviewed, endorsed, and validated \nthe arrests of the targeted individuals.  \n10.  Without judicial intervention there will be no end to Defendants’ invasive, \nunlawful, and unconstitutional practices despite being put on notice through lawsuits and articles.  \nThe P.A.P.D. has conducted, and continues to conduct, unlawful discrimination, targeting, and \nfalse arrests of men that P.A.P.D. officers perceive as gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-\nconforming, and/or men who have sex with men, using P.A.B.T. restrooms.  Because such \nconduct is ongoing, there is a threat of recurrent injuries to Plaintiffs.  The named Plaintiffs and \nother class members are at risk of further violations of their rights at the hands of the P.A.P.D.  \n11.  Indeed, the Port Authority and P.A.P.D. officers have been found liable for \nsimilar misconduct in the past.  Therefore, Defendants knew or should have known that the \npolicies and/or practices alleged herein were unlawful and unconstitutional.   \n12.  On November 18, 2004, after a four-day trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of \nAlejandro Martinez, who was arrested outside the men’s room at the PATH station concourse of \nthe World Trade Center and charged with public lewdness (he was accused by the arresting \nofficer of having engaged in public masturbation).  At trial, the jury was supplied with evidence \nsufficient to conclude that the Port Authority had a custom that led to widespread public \nlewdness arrests without regard to probable cause. \n-4- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 5 of 47\n13.  The jury awarded Mr. Martinez substantial damages.  Despite the jury finding of \nliability and the substantial monetary award, Defendants have not modified or instituted any \nprotocol, training, supervision or monitoring of these plainclothes patrols or types of arrests to \nprevent it from happening again, causing the pattern of unconstitutional arrests to reoccur.  \nDefendants continue to engage in the unlawful and unconstitutional policy and/or pattern and \npractice alleged herein. \n14.  To end these unlawful activities, Plaintiffs seek on behalf of themselves and all \nothers similarly situated a permanent injunction restraining P.A.P.D. officers from conducting \nsuch unlawful and unconstitutional tactics and arrests.  Plaintiffs also seek declaratory judgment \nand monetary damages provided for under the law, as allowed under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) and \n(b)(3).  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  Jurisdiction of this Court is predicated upon 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346. \n16.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and because, \ninter alia, (1) Defendants The Port Authority of York and New Jersey and Port Authority Police \nDepartment are located in this judicial district and (2) all relevant events took place in this \njudicial district. \nPARTIES AND OTHER RELEVANT PERSONS \n17.

The P.A.P.D. employs more than 1,700 \nofficers.  P.A.P.D. officers are empowered to detain and arrest individuals, and initiate \nprosecutions, at their discretion. \n53.  Starting in 2014, the Commanding Officer in the Bus Terminal Command started \nusing officers, new to the Bus Terminal, some straight out of the Port Authority Police Academy, \nfor plainclothes patrols without sufficient protocol, training, or supervision.  One purpose of \nthese patrols was to target “quality of life” crimes including, at times and depending on who was \nconducting the patrol, lewd behavior at urinals in the restrooms.  These plainclothes patrols \ninclude P.A.P.D. officers entering P.A.B.T. restroom facilities. \n54.  As identified in documentation provided by the New York State Division of \nCriminal Justice Services in response to a Freedom of Information Law request, under N.Y.P.L. \n§ 245.00 the P.A.P.D. arrested 74 individuals in 2014, 22 individuals in 2015, 20 individuals in \n2016, and 5 individuals in 2017 (as of August 18, 2017).  As such, from January 1, 2014, through \nAugust 18, 2017, the P.A.P.D. made 121 arrests under N.Y.P.L. § 245.00 for public lewdness at \nlocations patrolled by the P.A.P.D.  \n55.  Upon information and belief, P.A.P.D officers arrested at least 69 individuals in \n2014 in the P.A.B.T. on public lewdness charges; most of those arrested were accused of \nmasturbating in P.A.B.T. restrooms; and, according to court records, those individuals were \nallegedly observed by plainclothes officers often standing next to them at an adjacent urinal.4   \n                                                 \n4 Exhibit A, Joseph Goldstein, Lawyers Challenge Lewdness Arrests at Port Authority Bus \nTerminal, NEW YORK TIMES (Oct. 7, 2014), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/nyregion/lawyers-challenge-lewdness-arrests-at-port-\nauthority-bus-terminal.html. \n-13- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 14 of 47\n56.  Upon information and belief, P.A.P.D. officers engage in a pattern and practice of \nspecifically targeting men using P.A.B.T. restrooms that P.A.B.T. officers perceive as gay or \nbisexual (based on appearance), and/or gender non-conforming (a person assigned male at birth \nwearing what a P.A.P.D. officer believes to be non-masculine attire or jewelry), and/or men who \nhave sex with men, for arrest on charges including Public Lewdness under N.Y.P.L. § 245.00 \nand/or Exposure of a Person under N.Y.P.L. § 245.01. \n57.  The P.A.P.D.’s targeting operations often proceed in a typical manner.  A \nplainclothes P.A.P.D. officer will approach or wait at a urinal in a P.A.B.T. restroom, sometimes \nfor up to ten minutes, waiting for a man to approach the urinals.  The P.A.P.D. officer will then \npretend to use the urinal next to or near a targeted individual.  The P.A.P.D. officer may then \nstare at the targeted individual, make gestures, or grab his own genitals, even expose his own \ngenitals and/or peer over or around the privacy divider separating the urinals.  In some cases, the \nP.A.P.D. officer may step back from the urinal and attempt to look around the urinal’s privacy \nwall at the individual’s hands and genitals, and then exit the bathroom.  When the targeted \nindividual reacts to the behavior of the P.A.P.D. officer, the officer will exit the restroom.  \n58.  When the targeted individual exits the restroom, P.A.P.D. officers will then arrest \nhim on charges of Public Lewdness under N.Y.P.L. § 245.00 and/or Exposure of a Person under \nN.Y.P.L. § 245.01. \n59.  In support of the charges, P.A.P.D. officers sign a sworn affidavit using identical \nor nearly identical language, provided by an assistant district attorney, when describing the \nalleged behavior of the arrestee.  P.A.P.D. officers claim, in boilerplate language they have been \ngiven by the District Attorney’s office, that the targeted individual was observed masturbating.  \n-14- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 15 of 47\nVery often these recitations include no individualized facts or circumstances and no factual \nsupport for the conclusion that any conduct occurred in public.  \n60.  The officers’ repeated use of boilerplate language, the implausibly high arrest rate \nfor such alleged conduct of at least 69 arrests in 2014, sometimes with arrests for public \nlewdness occurring twice in one hour, or four times in two days, the non-credible nature of the \nallegations (observations of masturbation at P.A.B.T. urinals – separated by privacy walls – in a \ncrowded public restroom during rush-hour periods), and the officers’ entrapment-like conduct at \nthe urinals all support the conclusion that these were unlawful, unconstitutional, targeted arrests \nmade by P.A.P.D. officers on the discriminatory basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation, \nand/or to boost “quality of life” arrest statistics at P.A.B.T. and/or individual P.A.P.D. officers’ \narrest statistics.  While these practices continue today, the statistics further demonstrate a severe \ndrop in the number of arrests effected in 2015 through the present.  \n61.  Officer testimony further revealed that no additional protocols, training, or \nsupervision is provided for officers completing plainclothes patrols.  Indeed, Officer Tone \narticulated that “reasonable suspicion” is the appropriate standard for effecting public lewdness \narrests, not probable cause.  \n62.  Such targeting, and the concomitant arrest and criminal charges, results in, among \nother things, severe emotional and mental distress and trauma, potential jail sentences and fines, \nfear of law enforcement, fear of using the P.A.B.T and other Port Authority facilities, discomfort \nin using public restrooms, public embarrassment and humiliation, and potential and/or actual \nreputational and professional harm for the falsely accused victims.  \n-15- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 16 of 47\n63.  Upon information and belief, Defendants are continuing their discriminatory, \nunlawful, and unconstitutional conduct.  Similar lewdness arrests have occurred in 2017 and \n2018, subsequent to the initiation of this case. \nThe Port Authority Police Department’s Failure to Supervise Officer Conduct \n \n64.  Upon information and belief, Sergeants, Tour Commanders, and the Commanding \nOfficer of the Port Authority Bus Terminal play an active role in the on-the-job training, \ninstruction, and supervision of officer patrols, review of arrest paperwork, and prosecution of \ncriminal cases by the Assistant District Attorney. \n65.  Sergeants and tour commanders are responsible for overseeing the patrols and \narrests completed during their assigned shifts.  Indeed, both supervisors are required to review \nand sign off on the paperwork of any arrest completed by officers under their supervision.  \n66.  Officer testimony demonstrated that “reviewing” the arrest paperwork means \nensuring that the forms are properly completed and that the narrative description includes all the \nelements of the listed charge.  \n67.  One supervisor testified that he “checks for probable cause” by confirming with \neach arresting officer that probable cause existed, but does not further investigate the facts of the \ncase or ask for the facts that supported their conclusions that, for example, a man was \nmasturbating or that he was in public. \n68.  The Commanding Officer is further required to review and sign off on arrest \npaperwork for the cases prosecuted by an assistant district attorney, providing another level of \nsupervision and review for arrests of this nature. \n69.  Despite the three levels of supervisory review, named Plaintiffs and class \nmembers suffered false arrests based on unconstitutional policing practices.  The chain of \n-16- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 17 of 47\ncommand at the Port Authority Police Department failed to adequately supervise the officers \nconducting plainclothes patrols in the men’s restrooms at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, \ncausing plaintiffs’ false arrests.  \n70.  Upon information and belief, the Port Authority Police Department is continuing \nto fail to adequately supervise officer conduct resulting in false arrests for public lewdness and \nexposure of a person.   \nMartinez v. Port Authority (2005) \n71.  The Port Authority and P.A.P.D. officers have been found liable for similar false \narrests in the past.  As a result, Defendants knew or should have known that the policies and/or \npractices alleged herein were unlawful and unconstitutional.  \n72.  On February 1, 2000, Alejandro Martinez was arrested outside the men’s room at \nthe PATH station concourse of the World Trade Center.  (Exhibit B, Martinez v. Port Authority, \nNo. 01 Civ. 721 (PKC), 2005 WL 2143333, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2005.))  He was charged \nwith public lewdness, and remained in law enforcement custody for approximately 19 hours \nbefore he was released.  (Id.)  He was one of seven men arrested in separate alleged incidents of \npublic lewdness in a single restroom of the World Trade Center’s PATH station during an \napproximately 2.5-hour morning window.  (Id.)  Each individual was accused by the arresting \nofficer of having engaged in public masturbation.  (Id.) \n73.  Mr. Martinez was the only one of the seven arrestees who did not plead guilty to a \nreduced charge of disorderly conduct.  (Id.)  He proceeded to trial in state court, and after a one-\nday bench trial, he was acquitted.  (Id.) \n-17- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 18 of 47\n74.  Mr. Martinez subsequently brought a civil action in the Southern District of New \nYork against the Port Authority and three individual P.A.P.D. officers, asserting claims under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983.  (Id.) \n75.  At trial, Mr. Martinez “submitted evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to \nconclude that his arrest was part of a Port Authority pattern or practice to conduct ‘sweep’ arrests \n… for the crime of public lewdness, without regard to probable cause.”  (Martinez, 2005 WL \n2143333, at *5.)  Mr. Martinez demonstrated that “the documentation of the public lewdness \narrests contained nearly identical descriptions of the circumstances surrounding the acts of public \nlewdness.”  (Id. at *6.)  Mr. Martinez also submitted evidence “establishing that the Port \nAuthority had a custom of performing public lewdness arrests pursuant to a quota.”  (Id. at *7.)  \nThe evidence at trial was sufficient for the jury to conclude “that based on the exhibits and \ntestimony, these arrests occurred without probable cause.”  (Id. at *7, 8 (“the jury was supplied \nwith evidence sufficient to conclude that the Port Authority had a custom that led to widespread \npublic lewdness arrests without regard for probable cause.”))  \n76.  On November 18, 2004, after a four-day trial, a jury returned a verdict in Mr. \nMartinez’s favor.  (Id. at *1.)   \n77.  The trial jury awarded Mr. Martinez damages in the amount of $1,104,000, which \nthe judge remitted to $464,000.  (Id.)  \n78.  Despite the finding of liability in the Martinez case, and the substantial damage \naward, Defendants continue to engage in the unlawful and unconstitutional acts alleged herein. \nDefendants failed to modify any protocol, training, supervision protocol or monitoring of these \nplainclothes patrols or public lewdness arrests, causing these types of unconstitutional arrests to \nreoccur. \n-18- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 19 of 47\nThe Port Authority Police Department’s Failure to Investigate Its Pattern and Practice of \nUnlawful and Unconstitutional Discriminatory Conduct \n \n79.  On October 7, 2014, the New York Times released an article detailing the false \narrests of named plaintiffs Cornell Holden and Miguel Mejia (the “New York Times Article”).  \n80.  Despite the highly public nature of this article and the serious nature of the \nallegations therein, Defendants took no steps to investigate or correct the unconstitutional pattern \nand practice of policing that resulted in the false arrests of named Plaintiffs and class members.  \n81.  Upon information and belief, no internal investigation was ever conducted \nfollowing the publication of the New York Times Article and, despite the filing of this lawsuit, \nand notwithstanding discovery therein, no investigation into this practice has been conducted to \ndate. \n82.  Deposition testimony further revealed that no disciplinary action was taken \nagainst any Port Authority Police Officer related to the types of policing described herein, \ndespite the unconstitutional and entrapment-style tactics used by police officers to effect these \nfalse arrests.  Similarly, there was no change of protocol, no provided training, and no additional \nsupervision of plainclothes patrols in men’s bathrooms despite the potential for invasion of \ncommuter’s privacy resulting from these patrols. \n83.  Furthermore, while the New York Times Article provided recent examples of \nofficer misconduct, the Port Authority was on notice that this pattern and practice of policing is \nunconstitutional given the findings in the Martinez case in 2005. \n84.  Despite being on notice for more than a decade, and again put on notice in 2014, \nDefendants have taken no steps to investigate, correct or prevent false arrests for public lewdness \nand exposure of a person of men standing at urinals in P.A.B.T. restrooms.  \n-19- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 20 of 47\nThe Arrest of Plaintiff Cornell Holden \n \n85.  At or around 9:05 a.m. on May 12, 2014, Plaintiff Cornell Holden was using a \nurinal in a P.A.B.T. restroom. \n86.  While at the urinal, Mr. Holden noticed a person he later learned to be P.A.P.D. \nOfficer Opromalla watching him from an adjacent urinal.  P.A.P.D. Officer Opromalla then \nstepped back from his urinal, looked around the privacy wall between the urinals in an apparent \neffort to see Mr. Holden’s hands and genitals, and left the restroom. \n87.  When Mr. Holden exited the restroom, he was arrested by other P.A.P.D. officers.  \nHe was handcuffed in a public space in the P.A.B.T., in plain view of numerous P.A.B.T. \npatrons, and led to the P.A.P.D. detention facility. \n88.  Mr. Holden was charged with Public Lewdness under N.Y.P.L. § 245.00, and \nExposure of a Person under N.Y.P.L. § 245.01. \n89.  Mr. Holden was in P.A.P.D. detention for several hours.  During that time, he was \nfingerprinted and photographed. \n90.  Defendant P.A.P.D. Lieutenant Michael DeMartino issued the desk appearance \nticket number.  Defendant P.A.P.D. Sergeant Jordan Esposito signed off on the arrest paperwork. \nDefendant P.A.P.D. Lieutenant Richard Aylmer was the tour commander at the time of the \narrest. \n91.  While in a holding cell following his arrest, Mr. Holden overheard a P.A.P.D. \nofficer being congratulated on the arrest, and being referred to by other P.A.P.D. officers as “the \ngay whisperer.”   \n92.  At the time of the arrest, Mr. Holden had no criminal history.   \n-20- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 21 of 47\n93.  On June 27, 2014, Defendant P.A.P.D. Officer Opromalla signed a sworn \naffidavit in support of the charges.  In that affidavit, Officer Opromalla falsely claimed that he \nobserved Mr. Holden masturbating at a P.A.B.T. restroom urinal. \n94.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Holden was targeted for arrest by P.A.P.D. \nofficers, including Officer Opromalla, because of his appearance, in that his clothing, hairstyle, \nand jewelry were such that P.A.P.D. officers perceived him to be gay or bisexual and/or gender \nnon-conforming and/or a man who has sex with men. \n95.  Following his arrest, Mr. Holden pleaded not guilty and staunchly maintained his \ninnocence.  As a result, he was forced to appear in court a number of times over the succeeding \nmonths.  This included court appearances on July 2, 2014; September 8, 2014; October 29, 2014; \nand December 9, 2014.  Mr. Holden was presented with plea offers by the New York County \nAssistant District Attorney’s Office, all of which he refused. \n96.  At a court appearance on December 9, 2014, the New York County District \nAttorney’s Office moved to dismiss the charges against Mr. Holden.  The charges were \ndismissed and the record was sealed. \n97.  Mr. Holden has a reasonable fear of future wrongful arrests arising out of his \nlawful use of the P.A.B.T. and P.A.B.T. restrooms. \nThe Arrest of Plaintiff Miguel Mejia \n98.  At or around 5:04 p.m. on July 9, 2014, Plaintiff Miguel Mejia was using a urinal \nin a P.A.B.T. restroom. \n99.  While at the urinal, Mr. Mejia noticed a person he later learned to be a P.A.P.D. \nofficer watching him.  After Mr. Mejia turned his head to look at him, the P.A.P.D. officer left \nthe restroom. \n-21- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 22 of 47\n100.  When Mr. Mejia exited the restroom, he was arrested by other P.A.P.D. officers.  \nAt the time of his arrest, Mr. Mejia was not told why he was being arrested.  He was handcuffed \nin a public space in the P.A.B.T., in plain view of numerous P.A.B.T. patrons, and led to the \nP.A.P.D. detention facility. \n101.  Mr. Mejia was in P.A.P.D. detention for approximately three hours.  During that \ntime, he was fingerprinted and photographed. \n102.  Mr. Mejia was charged with Public Lewdness under N.Y.P.L. § 245.00. \n103.  Defendant P.A.P.D. Lieutenant Michael DeMartino signed off on the arrest \npaperwork as the desk sergeant.  Defendant P.A.P.D. Lieutenant Richard Aylmer was the tour \ncommander at the time of the arrest. \n104.  At the time of the arrest, Mr. Mejia had no criminal history.   \n105.  On July 23, 2014, Defendant P.A.P.D. Officer John Tone signed a sworn affidavit \nin support of the charges.  In that affidavit Officer Tone falsely claimed that he observed Mr. \nMejia masturbating at a P.A.B.T. restroom urinal.  P.A.P.D. Officer Shaun Kehoe was also \ninvolved in the arrest of Mr. Mejia.  \n106.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Mejia was targeted for arrest by P.A.P.D. \nofficers, including Officer Tone and/or Officer Kehoe, because of his appearance, in that his \nclothing, tattoos, and jewelry were such that P.A.P.D. officers perceived him to be gay or \nbisexual and/or gender non-conforming and/or a man who has sex with men. \n107.  Following his arrest, Mr. Mejia pleaded not guilty and staunchly maintained his \ninnocence.  As a result, he was forced to appear in court a number of times over the succeeding \nmonths.  This included court appearances on August 19, 2014 and October 14, 2014.  Mr. Mejia \n-22- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 23 of 47\nwas presented with plea offers by the New York County Assistant District Attorney’s Office, all \nof which he refused. \n108.  On November 17, 2014, Mr. Mejia was tried before the Hon. Larry Stephen of the \nSupreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, Criminal Term Part 1.  He testified \nin his own defense.  At the conclusion of the trial, Mr. Mejia was acquitted. \n109.  Mr. Mejia has a reasonable fear of future wrongful arrests arising out of his lawful \nuse of the P.A.B.T. and P.A.B.T. restrooms. \nThe Arrest of Plaintiff Malcom Russell \n110.  At or around 4:55 p.m. on September 23, 2014, while running errands, Plaintiff \nMalcom Russell approached a urinal in a P.A.B.T. restroom to urinate. \n111.  Prior to Mr. Russell even removing his penis from his pants to urinate, he was \napproached by a P.A.P.D. officer in plainclothes. \n112.  The officer told Mr. Russell he was under arrest for “soliciting.”  Mr. Russell was \nthen taken to the P.A.P.D. precinct in the Port Authority Bus Terminal. \n113.  Mr. Russell was in P.A.P.D. detention for approximately three hours.  During that \ntime, he was fingerprinted and photographed. \n114.  Mr. Russell was charged with Public Lewdness under N.Y.P.L. § 245.00 and \nExposure of a Person under N.Y.P.L. § 245.01. \n115.  Defendant P.A.P.D. Sergeant Jaycard signed off on the arrest paperwork as the \ndesk sergeant.  Defendant P.A.P.D. Lieutenant Paul O’Dell was the tour commander at the time \nof the arrest. \n116.  Defendant former Captain John Fitzpatrick signed off on the Police Criminal \nComplaint Follow-Up Report as the Commanding Officer of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. \n-23- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 24 of 47\n117.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Russell was targeted for arrest by P.A.P.D. \nofficers, including Defendant P.A.P.D. Officer Montero, because of his appearance, in that his \nclothing, tattoos, and jewelry were such that P.A.P.D. officers perceived him to be gay or \nbisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, and/or a man who has sex with men. \n118.  Following his arrest, upon information and belief, the arrest paperwork was \nsealed. \n119.  Mr. Russell has a reasonable fear of future wrongful arrests arising out of his \nlawful use of the P.A.B.T. and P.A.B.T. restrooms. \nThe Arrest of Plaintiff Marcos Polonia \n120.  At or around 5:10 p.m. on August 1, 2014, while on his way to catch a bus to \nteach a Zumba class, Plaintiff Marcos Polonia entered a P.A.B.T. restroom to urinate. \n121.  Upon entering the restroom, Mr. Polonia observed an individual who he later \ndetermined to be Defendant Vijay Seetaram standing at a urinal, attempting to make eye contact \nwith men using the restroom.  \n122.  Mr. Polonia initially approached a urinal on the same side of the restroom as \nOfficer Seetaram and felt Officer Seetaram watching him. \n123.  Because he found Officer Seetaram’s behavior odd and off-putting, Mr. Polonia \ndecided to use the urinals on the other side of the restroom.  \n124.  Officer Seetaram then followed Mr. Polonia to the other side of the restroom \nwhile holding his own genitals and gestured as if he were masturbating.  \n125.  Mr. Polonia, feeling extremely uncomfortable entered a stall to attempt to use the \nrestroom, but could not.  He then attempted to use a urinal, but again was too uncomfortable to \nuse the restroom. \n-24- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 25 of 47\n126.  Mr. Polonia then exited the restroom and walked to his bus gate, where he \nobserved Officer Seetaram running up to him and calling him back and away from the bus.  \n127.  Officer Seetaram then placed Mr. Polonia under arrest for public lewdness and \nexposure of a person.  \n128.  Mr. Polonia was in P.A.P.D. detention for several hours.  During that time, he was \nfingerprinted and photographed. \n129.  Mr. Polonia was charged with Public Lewdness under N.Y.P.L. § 245.00 and \nExposure of a Person under N.Y.P.L. § 245.01. \n130.  Defendant P.A.P.D. Sergeant Cruz signed off on the arrest paperwork as the desk \nsergeant.  No tour commander is listed in Mr. Polonia’s arrest record.  \n131.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Polonia was targeted for arrest by P.A.P.D. \nofficers, including Defendant P.A.P.D. Officer Seetaram, because of his appearance, in that his \nbrightly colored and slim fitting exercise clothing were such that P.A.P.D. officers perceived him \nto be gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, and/or a man who has sex with men. \n132.  Mr. Polonia was never prosecuted for either charge.  On or around October 8, \n2014, Mr. Polonia learned that the District Attorney’s office declined to prosecute.  \n133.  Mr. Polonia has a reasonable fear of future wrongful arrests arising out of his \nlawful use of the P.A.B.T. and P.A.B.T. restrooms. \nCouncil Member Dromm’s Letter to The Port Authority \n134.  As cited above, on October 7, 2014, the New York Times published an article \naddressing the pattern of arrests at the P.A.B.T. that is the subject of this Complaint.  (Exhibit \nA.) \n-25- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 26 of 47\n135.  Following the publication of that article, New York City Council Member Daniel \nDromm, from New York City’s 25th District, wrote a letter to the Port Authority, dated October \n10, 2014.  (Exhibit C.) \n136.  Council Member Dromm wrote:   \nI am writing to express my deep concern over policing practices at the Port Authority Bus \nTerminal.  A recent New York Times article has shed light on the pernicious pattern of \nPort Authority Policy Department (PAPD) officers arresting certain men for lewdness.  \nDespite the dearth of complaints, the PAPD seems to have stationed officers in the \nbathroom to arrest men for allegedly masturbating. \n \nIt appears from the article that gay men are being targeted.  I am deeply disturbed by \nwhat looks like the anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender profiling, which harkens \nback to a very dark time in this country when the members of the LGBT community were \nroutinely harassed by law enforcement.  I have painful memories of my own false arrest \non a similar charge as a teenager, and many other gay men have similar stories. \n \nPutting aside the LGBT dimension, I would like to say how utterly creepy and intrusive \nsuch a violation of someone’s personal space is.  Why you would be putting any \nresources into patrolling bathrooms to monitor how people urinate is beyond \ncomprehension. \n \nThese arrests and their prosecution are completely unacceptable.  I expect such false and \napparently discriminatory arrests to end immediately. \n-26- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 27 of 47\n \n137.  Despite Council Member Dromm’s letter, Defendants continue to engage in the \nunlawful and unconstitutional acts alleged herein. \nP.A.P.D.’s False Arrests Have Continued \n \n138.  Upon information and belief, despite the above-described incidents that should \nhave alerted P.A.P.D. that officers engage in a pattern and practice of targeting and wrongly \narresting men on baseless charges including public lewdness and exposure, falsely claiming that \nthey were masturbating at P.A.B.T. urinals, P.A.P.D. failed to train or retrain officers in non-\ndiscriminatory practices, failed to investigate these incidents or the patterns of incidents, failed to \nconsistently systematically monitor or audit these arrests for discriminatory patterns, failed to \nensure supervisors were consistently monitoring individual arrests for discrimination, and failed \nto consistently supervise and/or discipline officers who did make these arrests based on \ndiscriminatory reasons.  As a result of these failures, these unconstitutional arrests have \ncontinued. \n139.  For example, on March 13, 2016, Jeffrey K. Reed was arrested after using a \nP.A.B.T. restroom.  (Exhibit D, Notice of Claim of Jeffrey K. Reed.)5  A plainclothes P.A.P.D. \nofficer told Mr. Reed that he had been observed masturbating at a urinal.  (Id.)  He was held in \ncustody for approximately four hours.  (Id.)  He was charged with Public Lewdness and \nExposure of a Person.  (Id.)  Mr. Reed pleaded not guilty to the charges.  (Id.) \n140.  On October 18, 2016, the charges against Mr. Reed were dismissed.  (Id.) \n141.  Mr. Reed subsequently filed a notice of claim against The Port Authority of New \nYork and New Jersey, claiming, inter alia, false arrest and violation of his statutory and \n                                                 \n5   Mr. Reed is not a named Plaintiff in this action. \n-27- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 28 of 47\nconstitutional rights arising out of “the customs and practices of the Port Authority of New York \nand New Jersey and its police department.”  (Id.)    \nThe Named Plaintiffs’ Injuries \n142.  As a direct and proximate result of the above conduct by Defendants, and each of \nthem, the named Plaintiffs have been harmed, which harm includes, but is not limited to: \n143.  Violations of their constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable and unlawful \nsearches and seizures, including discriminatory targeting and intrusions into reasonable \nexpectations of privacy; \n144.

Violations of their constitutional rights to equal protection, including to be free \nfrom discriminatory application of the law; \n146.  Severe emotional and mental distress and trauma arising out of, among other \nthings, intimidation, harassment, and public humiliation, threats of potential jail sentences and \nfines, and potential and/or actual reputational and professional harm; and \n147.  Other harm according to proof.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n148.  All claims set forth in the First and Second Causes of Action are brought by the \nnamed Plaintiffs individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated persons pursuant to \nRules 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n149.  The named Plaintiffs propose the First and Second Causes of Action be certified \non behalf of the following class:  persons who, because they are (1) male, (2) gay or bisexual, \nand/or gender non-conforming, and/or have sex with men, or perceived to be gay or bisexual, \n-28- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 29 of 47\nand/or gender non-conforming, and/or have sex with men by P.A.P.D. officers, and (3) used a \nPort Authority Bus Terminal restroom urinal and were arrested by the P.A.P.D. for offenses \nunder N.Y.P.L. § 245.00 and/or N.Y.P.L. § 245.01 from 2014 through the present. \n150.  The claims of the proposed class representatives and those of the putative class \nmembers in the First and Second Causes of Action raise common questions of law and fact \nconcerning, inter alia, whether Defendants have implemented, enforced, encouraged, and/or \nsanctioned a policy, practice, and/or custom of: \nTargeting men using a restroom urinal at the Port Authority Bus Terminal for \nfalse arrest and criminal charges including public lewdness and exposure, by \nfalsely claiming that they were masturbating at urinals. \n151.  These questions are common to the named Plaintiffs and to the members of the \nputative class because Defendants have acted and will continue to act on grounds generally \napplicable to both the named Plaintiffs and putative class members. \n152.  Upon information and belief, members of the putative class are so numerous that \njoinder of all class members is impracticable. \n153.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members of the \nputative class. \n154.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nmembers of the putative class. \n155.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by counsel who are experienced in federal \nclass action, including those involving civil rights issues. \n156.  The issues common to the class predominate any individual issues of law or fact. \n-29- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 30 of 47\n157.  In addition to the foregoing reasons, class action is the superior vehicle for \nlitigating Plaintiffs’ claims due to the financial burden and emotional toll of individual litigation, \nand the embarrassing nature of the false charges.  \n158.  As set forth above, Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the \nmembers of the putative class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive and corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:  42 U.S.C. § 1983 CLAIM OF FOURTH AMENDMENT \nVIOLATIONS \n(Against Officer Defendants) \n \n159.  Plaintiffs bring this claim for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief against \nOfficer Defendants to redress continuing and likely future violations of the Fourth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution. \n160.  Upon information and belief, Officer Defendants have, in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, officially engaged in, encouraged, supervised, or \notherwise sanctioned a policy, practice, and/or custom of:  (i) identifying and targeting men, \nincluding Plaintiffs, using restroom urinals at the P.A.B.T., on the basis that they were perceived \nto be gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, and/or have sex with men; and (ii) \nunlawfully and wrongfully stopping, searching including by intruding on reasonable expectations \nof privacy by looking over or around privacy dividers, seizing, and falsely arresting and charging \nthose targeted men, including Plaintiffs, without probable cause in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  \n-30- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 31 of 47\n161.  As a result of the P.A.P.D.’s failures, there exists a credible threat that the named \nPlaintiffs and putative class members will be subjected to false arrest and baseless criminal \ncharges in the future. \n162.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable and repeated injury unless the Court orders \nequitable relief.  Such injury includes, inter alia, the deprivation of Plaintiffs’ constitutionally \nprotected rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n163.  For reasons including, but not limited to, those stated herein, an actual dispute \nexists between Plaintiffs and Officer Defendants, in which the parties have genuine and opposing \ninterests that are direct and substantial, and of which a judicial determination will be final and \nconclusive. \n164.  Compelling Officer Defendants, their agents, employees, and successors in office, \nand all persons acting in concert with them, to comply with the dictates of the United States \nConstitution does not impose an improper or undue burden on Officer Defendants, and, in fact, it \nserves the public interest by ensuring compliance with well-established Constitutional \nprotections. \n165.  Monetary damages are warranted in this case and should be awarded.  However, \nmonetary damages alone cannot adequately address the injuries suffered by named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the putative class. \n166.  The named Plaintiffs and the putative class are entitled to the issuance of a \npermanent injunction prohibiting Officer Defendants from engaging in the unlawful and \nunconstitutional practices alleged herein. \n167.

The dispute entitles the named Plaintiffs and the putative class to a declaratory \njudgment that by engaging in the acts and conduct complained of herein, Officer Defendants \ndenied Plaintiffs their Fourth Amendment rights and protections, including, but not limited to, \nthe right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and false arrest and baseless \ncharges, in violation of the United States Constitution.  Such judgment will serve a useful \npurpose in clarifying and settling the legal issues in the case. \n169.  Specifically, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Officer Defendants’ acts, \npractices, policies, customs, and/or omissions, including identifying and targeting men, including \nPlaintiffs, using restroom urinals at the P.A.B.T., on the basis that they were perceived to be gay \nor bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, and/or men who have sex with men, and unlawfully \nand wrongfully searching, seizing, and falsely arresting and charging those targeted men, \nincluding Plaintiffs, without probable cause, have deprived Plaintiffs of their rights under the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n170.   Plaintiffs are also entitled to a declaration that Officer Defendants’ acts, \npractices, policies, customs, and/or omissions, as detailed above, violate the Fourth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution on its face and as applied. \n171.  The named Plaintiffs and the putative class are entitled to compensatory damages \nfor economic harm, pain and suffering, and emotional and mental distress in an amount to be \n-32- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 33 of 47\ndetermined at trial against Officer Defendants jointly and severally, together with interest and \ncosts. \n172.  The named Plaintiffs are entitled to punitive damages in an amount to be \ndetermined at trial against Officer Defendants, whose actions constituted outrageous conduct, \nwere reckless, and showed a callous indifference to and willful disregard of Plaintiffs’ rights as \nset forth above. \n173.  The named Plaintiffs and the putative class are entitled to reasonable attorneys’ \nfees and costs to be paid by Officer Defendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and \n174.  The named Plaintiffs and the putative class are entitled to such other and further \nrelief as the Court deems just and equitable. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:  42 U.S.C. § 1983 CLAIM OF FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT VIOLATIONS \n(Against Officer Defendants) \n \n175.  Plaintiffs bring this claim for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief against \nOfficer Defendants to redress continuing and likely future violations of the Due Process Clause \nand the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n176.  Upon information and belief, Officer Defendants have, in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution engaged in, encouraged, supervised, or \notherwise sanctioned a policy, practice, and/or custom of: (i) identifying and targeting men, \nincluding Plaintiffs, using restroom urinals at the P.A.B.T., on the basis that they were perceived \nto be gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, and/or men who have sex with men, in \nviolation of, inter alia, Plaintiffs’ liberty interests in self-expression, bodily integrity, and privacy \nin protecting those choices from being policed as well as in using urinals shielded by privacy \ndividers outside of government view; and (ii) unlawfully and wrongfully searching, seizing, \n-33- \n \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-JGK   Document 117   Filed 11/28/18   Page 34 of 47\narresting, and charging those targeted men, including Plaintiffs, thus subjecting these men, \nincluding Plaintiffs, to discriminatory treatment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n177.  The policy, practice, and/or custom of false arrests addressed herein violated \nPlaintiffs’ rights to due process, because such false arrests and the concomitant baseless charges \nof public lewdness and/or exposure were unfair and not impartial, and deprived Plaintiffs of their \nliberty without due process of law.   \n178.  The policy, practice, and/or custom of false arrests and baseless charges addressed \nherein, of men that P.A.P.D. officers perceive as gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, \nand/or men who have sex with men, violated Plaintiffs’ equal protection rights because such \nfalse arrests were based upon impermissible and discriminatory considerations. \n179.  The named Plaintiffs and putative class members are at risk of prospective \nconstitutional deprivations at the hands of Officer Defendants because Officer Defendants’ \npolicy, practice, and/or custom detailed above is ongoing, and Plaintiffs still have cause to use \nthe P.A.B.T. and may have cause to use P.A.B.T. restroom urinals.   \n180.  As a result, there exists a credible threat that the named Plaintiffs and putative \nclass members will be subjected to false arrest and baseless criminal charges in the future. \n181.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable and repeated injury unless the Court orders \nequitable relief.  Such injury includes, inter alia, the deprivation of Plaintiffs’ constitutionally \nprotected rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n182.

The named Plaintiffs and the putative class are entitled to the issuance of a \npermanent injunction prohibiting Officer Defendants from engaging in the unlawful and \nunconstitutional practices alleged herein. \n186.  Specifically, Plaintiffs are entitled to permanent relief enjoining and restraining \nOfficer Defendants, their agents, employees, successors in office, and all others acting in concert \nwith them from identifying and targeting men, including Plaintiffs, using restroom urinals at the \nP.A.B.T., on the basis that they were perceived to be gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-\nconforming, and/or men who have sex with men, unlawfully and wrongfully searching, seizing, \nand falsely arresting and charging those targeted men, including Plaintiffs. \n187.

Plaintiffs bring this claim for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief against \nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Port Authority Police Department to \nredress continuing and likely future violations of the Fourth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n195.  Upon information and belief, the Municipal Defendants have, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, officially implemented, enforced, \nencouraged, and/or sanctioned a policy, practice, and/or custom of:  (i) identifying and targeting \nmen, including Plaintiffs, using restroom urinals at the P.A.B.T., on the basis that they were \nperceived to be gay or bisexual, and/or gender non-conforming, and/or have sex with men; and \n(ii) unlawfully and wrongfully stopping, searching, seizing, and falsely arresting and charging \nthose targeted men, including Plaintiffs, without probable cause in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  \n196.

As a result of these failures, these unconstitutional arrests have \ncontinued. \n197.  As a result of the Municipal Defendants’ failures, there exists a credible threat \nthat the named Plaintiffs and putative class members will be subjected to false arrest and baseless \ncriminal charges in the future. \n198.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable and repeated injury unless the Court orders \nequitable relief.  Such injury includes, inter alia, the deprivation of Plaintiffs’ constitutionally \nprotected rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n199.
