    "summary": "<p>This was a challenge to the congressional redistricting plan adopted by the State of Illinois after the 2010 census (the &ldquo;Adopted Map&rdquo;). Plaintiffs were an organization called the Committee for a Fair and Balanced Map (a not for profit organization created by Illinois citizens concerned about the congressional redistricting process in Illinois), ten incumbent Republican members, ten incumbent Republican members of Congress, and six registered voters (including some who identify themselves as Latino voters and others who assert that they are Republican voters). The defendants are the Illinois State Board of Elections (the agency charged with implementing the results of the redistricting process) and its members.</p>\r\n<p>On July 27, 2011, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that the Adopted Map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1973(a) (Count I), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Fifteenth Amendment because Congressional Districts 3, 4, and 5 in Illinois were drawn intentionally to dilute the Latino vote (Counts II and III). Plaintiffs also alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause because Latino ethnicity was the predominant consideration in drawing Adopted District 4 and as such, was an intentional and unjustified racial gerrymander (Count IV). Plaintiffs further contended that Adopted Districts 11, 13 and 17 demonstrated a blatant partisan gerrymander against Republican voters in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments (Counts V and VI).</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment on all counts and to enjoin defendants from enforcing or giving any effect to the proposed district boundaries as drawn in the Proposed Congressional Plan, including enjoining defendants from conducting any elections for the United States House of Representatives based on the Adopted Map. Plaintiffs further sought to compel the Board to conduct elections for the United States House of Representatives based on a redistricting plan chosen by the Court that complies with the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. Plaintiffs further sought attorneys&rsquo; fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988 and as authorized by 42 U.S.C. &sect;1973l(e).</p>\r\n<p>The court held a two-day trial on plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for permanent injunction. On December 15, 2011, found in favor of defendant. As to the partisan gerrymander claims, although the Court agreed that the crafting of the Adopted Map was a blatant political move to increase the number of Democratic congressional seats, the Court ultimately concluded that plaintiffs failed to present a workable standard by which to evaluate such claims. As to plaintiffs' vote dilution claims, those failed because plaintiffs had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the state legislature intentionally discriminated against Latinos in passing the Adopted Map. The Court again recognized that Latino ethnicity was a factor in creating District 4 in 1991, but the weight of the evidence showed that the predominant intent of the 2011 Illinois legislature in maintaining Adopted District 4 in substantially the same shape as when it was created in 1991 was a desire to enhance Democratic seats in the state as a whole, to keep Democratic incumbents in Districts 3, 4, and 5 with their constituents, to preserve existing district boundaries, and to maintain communities of interest. Because race was not the predominant factor, plaintiffs failed to meet its burden of proof on its racial gerrymander claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or the Constitution.</p>",

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for an order dismissing \nPlaintiffs‟ Complaint.  In support of this motion, Defendants submit this memorandum. \nIntroduction \n  Plaintiffs – including 10 Republican U.S. Representatives – have filed a complaint \ncontaining four counts concerning purported harm to Latino voters in three Chicago-area \nCongressional Districts (Counts I-IV) and two counts concerning alleged political \ngerrymandering across the State (Counts V-VI).  Most of the Complaint focuses on alleged \npartisan gerrymandering, but every court to address such claims – including the U.S. Supreme \nCourt – has rejected them.  When the allegations in support of these meritless claims are stripped \naway, the few remaining allegations fall well short of pleading claims for racial gerrymandering \nor vote dilution.  As such, the entire Complaint should be dismissed. \n \n \n \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 2 of 15 PageID #:194\nArgument \n  A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim  \nupon which relief may be granted.  Hallinan v. Fraternal Order of Police of Chicago Lodge No.  \n7, 570 F.3d 811, 820 (7th Cir. 2009).  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff's “factual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Bell Atlantic v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).  Put \ndifferently, a “complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to „state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.‟” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, ___U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 \n(2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  “A pleading that offers „labels and conclusions‟ or \n„a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.‟” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at \n1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  “Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders „naked \nassertion[s]‟ devoid of „further factual enhancement.‟”  Id.   (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n557).1  \nI.    Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n  In Count I of the Complaint, the Racial Dilution Plaintiffs claim that Districts 3, 4, and 5 \nintentionally dilute Latinos‟ votes in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1973 (“VRA”).  Specifically, Plaintiffs claim the Congressional Map dilutes the votes \nof Latino voters by “packing” them into District 4 and thereby “reducing” their percentages in \nDistricts 3 and 5.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1-2, 52-54, 58, 110, 115.)  This count should be dismissed for \nfailure to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for relief.  \n                       \n1  Plaintiffs “who merely parrot the statutory language of the claims that they are pleading … rather than \nproviding some specific facts to ground those legal claims … have not provided the „showing‟ required \nby Rule 8.”  Brooks v. Ross, 578 F.3d 574, 581 (7th Cir. 2009); see also Giannopoulos v. Iberia Lineas \nAereas de Espana, S.A., 2011 WL 3166159, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2011); Norington v. Daniels, 2011 \nWL 2214128, at *1 (N.D. Ind. June 6, 2011).  \n2 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 3 of 15 PageID #:195\nA.  Section 2 of The Voting Rights Act  \n  Section 2 of the VRA prohibits the “denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of \nthe United States to vote on account of race or color.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973.  An electoral \nmechanism violates Section 2 if it operates to minimize or cancel out a racial group‟s ability to \nelect its preferred candidates.  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 48 (1986).  To establish a \nSection 2 Voting Right Act violation, a plaintiff must first allege as a threshold matter the \nexistence of three facts: (1) the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact \nto constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) the minority group is politically cohesive; \nand (3) the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority \ngroup‟s preferred candidate.  Id. at 48-51.  “Unless these points are established, there neither has \nbeen a wrong nor can [there] be a remedy.”  Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40-41 (1993).  In \naddition, when applied to a claim that single-member districts dilute minority votes, the first \nGingles precondition requires “the possibility of creating more than the existing number of \nreasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of \nits choice.”  Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1008 (1994); League of United Latin Am. \nCitizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 429-30 (2006) (“LULAC”).  Only where the plaintiff has \nestablished the three Gingles requirements does a court proceed to analyze whether a violation \nhas occurred based on the totality of the circumstances.  LULAC, 548 U.S. at 425-26.   \nB.  Count I Fails to Allege the First Gingles Requirement  \nPlaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 2 because they nowhere plead the first \nGingles requirement.  Districts 3, 4, and 5 are single-member districts, and Plaintiffs do not \nallege that another district beyond District 4 could be created from among those districts with a \nsufficiently large and compact Latino population for Latino voters to elect candidates of their \n3 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:196\nchoice.  See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1008 (first precondition requires ability to create more than \nexisting number of majority-minority districts).  Instead, Plaintiffs make only a sweeping \ngeneralization about a growing Latino population across Illinois and in Cook County.  (Compl. ¶ \n51.)  \nSignificantly, Plaintiffs not only fail to plead the first Gingles precondition, but the facts \nPlaintiffs do plead make it impossible for them to satisfy it.  Plaintiffs allege that Latino voters \nrepresent only 24.64% and 16.05% of the voting age population in District 3 and District 5, \nrespectively, and 65.92% of the voting age population in District 4.  (Compl. ¶¶ 52-54.)  \nRegardless of how the Latino populations could be configured, Plaintiffs‟ own numbers \ndemonstrate that there is no way a second district can be drawn with over a 50% Latino voting \nage population, as required under the first Gingles requirement.  See Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 \nU.S. 1, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1245-46 (2009); LULAC, 548 U.S. at 445 (Kennedy, J.).  Thus, Plaintiffs \ncannot allege the first Gingles precondition.   \nIn addition, Plaintiffs are alleging only that Latino voters in Districts 3 and 5 will be \nprevented from “having any significant influence in choosing primary and general election \ncandidates of their choice.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 2, 110.)   While they attempt to cast their VRA claim \notherwise, Plaintiffs leap from the former statement to the conclusion that “[a]s a result, the \nProposed Congressional Plan … affords the Racial Dilution Plaintiffs less opportunity to \nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” (Compl. ¶ 111.)  \nSection 2 is not violated, however, where a minority group is only large enough to influence \nelection results, as opposed to elect candidates of their choice.  LULAC, 548 U.S. at 445-46 \n(Kennedy, J.); McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist., 851 F.2d 937, 947 (7th Cir. 1988).  In sum, \n4 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:197\nbecause Plaintiffs fail to allege the first requirement of Gingles – and cannot do so – Count I \nshould be dismissed for failure to state a claim. \n  C.  Count I Fails to Sufficiently Plead Gingles Requirements 2 and 3  \n \nPlaintiffs‟ allegations with respect to the second and third Gingles requirements fail to \nstate a claim under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs simply \nparrot those requirements and fail to allege the third requirement with respect to Cook County or \nChicago, let alone Districts 3, 4, and 5, specifically.  The sole allegation regarding the second \nGingles requirement is that “Latino voters traditionally and consistently vote cohesively in the \nState of Illinois, particularly in Cook County.”  The sole allegation as to the third requirement is \nthat “[t]raditionally, elections in Illinois” have been racially and ethnically polarized and white \nnon-Latinos and African-Americans have voted sufficiently as blocks to defeat Latino voters‟ \npreferred candidates.  (Compl. ¶¶ 56-57.)  These allegations only restate the Gingles \nrequirements and only discuss Illinois broadly.   But, “[t]he inquiry into the existence of vote \ndilution . . . is district specific.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 59 n. 28.  And Plaintiffs‟ conclusory \nallegations and the failure to sufficiently allege bloc voting along racial lines in the challenged \ndistricts are fatal pleading defects.  See Iqbal, __ U.S. __, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. \n  D.   Plaintiffs Fail to Make Any Allegations Relevant to a Totality-of-the- \nCircumstances Analysis     \n \nPlaintiffs‟ VRA claim fails even if the Gingles preconditions were pled in the Complaint.  \nPlaintiffs fail to allege any facts to support their claim of intent to dilute or to allege a single \nfactor relevant to LULAC‟s totality-of-the-circumstances analysis under Section 2.  In assessing \nthe totality of the circumstances under Section 2, the Supreme Court has focused on the \nfollowing factors:   \n5 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:198\nthe history of voting-related discrimination in the State or political subdivision; \nthe extent to which voting in the elections of the State or political subdivision is \nracially polarized; the extent to which the State or political subdivision has used \nvoting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for \ndiscrimination against the minority group ...; the extent to which minority group \nmembers bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, \nemployment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the \npolitical process; the use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns; \nand the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to \npublic office in the jurisdiction.  \n \nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 425-26 (citing Gingles) (also noting the proportionality of majority-\nminority districts to a minority group‟s population in the relevant area as a consideration). \nPlaintiffs fail to allege any of these factors in a manner favorable to their claim.  The \nclosest Plaintiffs come are their conclusory, non-district-specific polarization allegations and \ntheir allegation that “[d]espite Illinois‟s large and growing Latino population, the Proposed \nCongressional Plan contains only one majority district, District 4, out of the eighteen districts \ncreated.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 52, 57.)  Again, however, vote dilution is a district-specific, not statewide \ninquiry.  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 59 n. 28.  While Plaintiffs fail to allege any of the above factors in \na manner favorable to their claim, they do include an allegation defeating their claim:  Plaintiffs \nallege that District 4 was originally drawn to provide Latino voters an opportunity to elect \ncandidates of their choice.  (Compl. ¶¶ 2, 60). \nBecause Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient allegations to state a claim for relief under \neither the Gingles preconditions or a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, Plaintiffs have failed \nto state a claim for vote dilution under Section 2 of the VRA, and Count I should be dismissed. \nII.     Count II Fails to State a Claim for Intentional Vote Dilution Under the \n  Fourteenth Amendment \n \nThe Racial Dilution Plaintiffs likewise fail to state a claim in Count II for vote dilution \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.  To state a Fourteenth Amendment claim for vote dilution, \n6 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:199\nPlaintiffs must allege that the challenged districting was “conceived or operated as [a] purposeful \ndevic[e] to further racial discrimination by minimizing, cancelling out or diluting the voting \nstrength of racial elements of the voting population.” City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 66 \n(1980) (Stewart, J., plurality opinion); Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1406 (7th Cir. 1984).  In \nevaluating claims of vote dilution under the Fourteenth Amendment, courts have applied a \ntotality-of-the-circumstances analysis focusing on factors set out in Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 \nF.2d 1297 (5th Cir. 1973).  See, e.g., Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 620-22 (1982).  The factors \ncourts have focused on when considering Fourteenth Amendment vote dilution claims mirror the \nVRA totality-of-the-circumstances factors because the VRA factors were also based on Zimmer.  \nSee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36 n. 4.     \nPlaintiffs do not make any allegations in support of their Fourteenth Amendment claim \ndistinct from their VRA claim.  Thus, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for vote dilution under the \nFourteenth Amendment for the same reasons they have failed to state a claim for intentional vote \ndilution under the VRA.  See Section I.D., supra. \nIII.     Count IV Fails to State a Claim for Racial Gerrymandering Under the Fourteenth \nAmendment \n \n  In Count IV, the Racial Gerrymander Plaintiff alleges that District 4 was impermissibly \nracially gerrymandered to create a majority Latino district in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  This count also should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.   \nThe Complaint fails to make sufficient factual allegations to support the claim that \ntraditional districting principles were subordinated to racial considerations.  In fact, the \nComplaint demonstrates that traditional districting principles were respected, as “[a] Latino \nmajority district with a very similar shape was created in the same location after the 1990 census \nin judicial proceedings over redistricting.”  (Compl. at ¶ 60.)  In other words, District 4 has \n7 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:200\nessentially retained its configuration for over two decades.  See Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. \n725, 740 (1983) (preserving the core of prior districts is a traditional districting principle).  As \nsuch, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege that traditional districting principles were disregarded.  \nThus, because Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief, Count IV should be dismissed. \nIV.  Count III Fails Because the Fifteenth Amendment Does Not Apply to Vote Dilution  \n  The Supreme Court has limited the reach of the Fifteenth Amendment to instances of a \npurposeful and discriminatory denial or abridgment of the right to vote, specifically refusing to \nextend its reach to cover allegations of vote dilution.  Because Count III alleges vote dilution, \nand not the denial or abridgement of the right to vote, it should be dismissed. \n   The Fifteenth Amendment provides that the “right of citizens of the United States to vote \nshall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color or \nprevious condition of servitude.” U.S. CONST. amend. XV, § 1.  The Fifteenth Amendment \n“prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial or abridgment by government of the freedom \nto vote....” Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 65 (1980) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added).  The \nFifteenth Amendment applies to those governmental actions that seek to “deny the vote,” \n“confine and restrict the voting franchise,” or “exclude … from voting” a class of voters on the \nbasis of race.  See Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 513-14 (2000). \n  The crux of Racial Dilution Plaintiffs‟ claim is not that the Congressional Map denies \ntheir, or anyone else‟s, right to vote, but rather that it “dilutes” it.  (Compl. ¶ 120) (emphasis \nadded).  Specifically, Count III alleges that Latinos in District 4 “will see their votes wasted” and \nthat Latinos in Districts 3 and 5 will not have “any significant influence in choosing” candidates \nto their liking. Id. (emphasis added).  Even taken as true, however, these allegations of vote \ndilution do not state a valid cause of action under the Fifteenth Amendment. \n8 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:201\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to recognize an allegation of vote dilution as \na Fifteenth Amendment claim.  See Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U.S. 320, 334 n. \n3 (2000) (“It is established that the Supreme Court has “never held that vote dilution violates the \nFifteenth Amendment … [it] never even „suggested‟ as much”) (citations omitted); Bolden, 446 \nU.S. at 65 (because African-Americans could “register and vote without hindrance,” the \nprotection of the Fifteenth Amendment was not implicated) (plurality opinion); Beer v. United \nStates, 425 U.S. 130, 142 n. 14 (1976); Osburn v. Cox, 369 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir. 2004) \n(“The Supreme Court has recognized that the Fifteenth Amendment protects the right to register \nand to vote, but it has never held or even suggested that vote dilution violates the Fifteenth \nAmendment”).   \n  Accordingly, district courts have applied this analysis to dismiss Fifteenth Amendment \ndilution claims.  See Polish Am. Congress v. City of Chicago, 211 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1107 (N.D. \nIll. 2002) (Fifteenth Amendment racial dilution claim dismissed because Fifteenth Amendment \n“has been successfully invoked only by plaintiffs who allege government interference with their \nabilities to register to vote or to cast ballots in elections because of their race or color”); see also \nArizona Minority Coalition for Fair Redistricting v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Com’n., \n366 F. Supp. 2d 887, 911 (D. Ariz. 2005) (Fifteenth Amendment claim dismissed where \nplaintiffs did “not claim that they have been denied such [ballot] access; rather, they allege that \nthe 2002 Plan does not give them as much influence as they would like in a single legislative \ndistrict”). \n     Plaintiffs attempt to remedy this fatal defect in Count III by grafting a single sentence \nonto that count: “As a result, the Proposed Congressional Plan denies or abridges the right of the \nRacial Dilution Plaintiffs to vote, on account of their race or color.”  (Compl. ¶ 121.)  But the \n9 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:202\nComplaint includes no factual support for the proposition that anyone‟s right to vote has been or \nwill be denied.  Further, this single conclusory and entirely unsupported sentence is not enough \nto save the claim.  See Iqbal, __ U.S. __, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (formulaic recitation of elements and \nbald assertions without factual support are insufficient).  For the foregoing reasons, Count III \nshould be dismissed. \nV.   The Partisan Gerrymander Claims in Counts V and VI Should Be Dismissed \n  A.  These Claims Fail to State a Claim for Which Relief May be Granted \n \nIn Counts V and VI, the Partisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs allege that the Congressional \nMap violates their First Amendment and Equal Protection rights, respectively.  Both claims rest \non the assertion that the Map, on a statewide basis and with regard to Districts 3 and 11, \n“intentionally and unreasonably dilutes the votes of Republican voters in a manner that gives \nRepublicans a far smaller chance of electing candidates of their choice than would result from \ntraditional, non-partisan redistricting.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 131, 136.) \nPartisan gerrymandering has existed since this country was founded.  See Vieth v. \nJubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 274-76 (2004) (plurality opinion).  Since partisan gerrymander claims \nwere considered by the Supreme Court 25 years ago in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986), \nhowever, no court anywhere in the country has ever invalidated a legislative redistricting plan as \na partisan gerrymander, while over a dozen decisions have rejected such claims.  See, e.g., Vieth, \n267, 279-80 n. 6 (plurality opinion); Smith v. Boyle, 144 F.3d 1060 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming \ndismissal of political claim against Illinois‟s Supreme Court election districts); La Porte County \nRepublican Central Comm. v. Board of Comm'rs of County of La Porte, 43 F.3d 1126, 1128 (7th \nCir. 1994) (affirming dismissal of partisan gerrymander claim); Illinois Legislative Redistricting \nComm'n v. LaPaille, 782 F. Supp. 1272, 1276 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (dismissing claim); Hastert v. \n10 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:203\nState Bd. of Elections, 777 F. Supp. 634 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (three judge panel) (rejecting claim \nfollowing trial).   \n  Plaintiffs do not explicitly offer any standard by which the Court may judge their claims.  \nInstead, they just allege certain facts that they contend are enough to invalidate the \nCongressional Map.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that:  \n(1) Democrats controlled the process and did not allow for review, comment, and debate \nin the manner preferred by Republicans prior to passage (Compl. ¶¶ 38-46);  \n(2) Illinois is “relatively evenly divided between Republican and Democratic Voters”2 \n(Compl. ¶¶ 70-74);  \n(3) the Congressional Map “slices,” “packs,” and adds “Democratic enclaves” and \n“suburban neighborhoods” to create Democratic-friendly districts (Compl. ¶¶ 75-86);  \n(4) Republican lawmakers are now placed in the same district as each other or in new, \nless electorally-friendly, districts than their Democratic counterparts (Compl. ¶¶ 87-95);  \n(5) the Congressional Map “unnecessarily splits a significant number of prominent and \npopulous communities” and “significant Chicago suburbs” (Compl. ¶ 96); and  \n(6) the Congressional Map is less compact than the present congressional map. (Compl. \n¶¶ 97-100). \n \nThere is nothing new or novel about Plaintiffs‟ approach, however.  In essence and in \nfact, they are utilizing Justice Powell‟s “fairness standard,” set forth in Davis, 478 U.S. at 175-78 \n(1986) (concurring in part and dissenting in part).  In Davis, Justice Powell identified the \nfollowing allegations as relevant to his proposed standard: (1) A suspect legislative process (the \nexclusion of the minority party from the legislative process and mapmaking decisions, the \nmajority party‟s broken promises regarding public hearings, less than two days for the minority \nparty to review the map, and the fact that the map was passed on party line vote on the last day of \nsession) (Id. at 175-76); (2) disregard of traditional political subdivisions (counties, cities, and \ntownships are “carved up” to create oddly-shaped districts in an effort to benefit the majority \n                       \n2 The Racial Dilution Plaintiffs also cherry pick certain electoral results over the last 15 years to paint a \npicture of an evenly-divided political environment, though they do acknowledge that as recently as 2010 \nthere were 12 Democratic Congressman to 7 Republicans.  The 12-7 Democratic-Republican split that \nexisted last year alone casts substantial doubt on the viability of the partisan gerrymander claims‟ central \npremise: that there is something constitutionally infirm about a map that “creates a situation” that “is \nlikely” to result in a 12-6 Democratic-Republican split in the Congressional delegation. (Compl. ¶ 73.) \n11 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:204\nparty) (Id. at 176-77); and (3) process governed by partisan motivations (a map is created with \nthe purpose of creating many safe seats for the majority party at the expense of the minority \nparty) (Id. at 177-78).     \nThe Partisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs follow precisely the same script here.  But the \nSupreme Court has already considered and rejected Justice Powell‟s “fairness” approach to \npartisan gerrymander claims. See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 290-91 (plurality opinion).  Specifically, \nJustice Scalia‟s plurality opinion affirming the dismissal of the partisan gerrymander claim in \nVieth rejected the fairness standard as being judicially unmanageable: \n“Fairness” does not seem to us a judicially manageable standard.  Fairness is \ncompatible with noncontiguous districts, it is compatible with districts that \nstraddle political subdivisions, and it is compatible with a party‟s not winning the \nnumber of seats that mirrors the proportion of its vote.  Some criterion more solid \nand more demonstrably met than that seems to us necessary to enable the state \nlegislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully \nconstrain the discretion of the courts, and to win public acceptance for the courts‟ \nintrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking. \n \nVieth, 541 U.S. at 291.  Justice Kennedy‟s concurrence in Vieth, which joined Justice Scalia‟s \nfour-member plurality decision dismissing the partisan gerrymander claim, agreed that the \nfairness standard (along with all other proposed standards discussed in Vieth) was an insufficient \nbasis on which to grant relief: “The failings of the many proposed standards for measuring the \nburden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights make our intervention improper.” \nVieth, 541 U.S. at 317 (plurality opinion).3  As a result, five Justices in Vieth held all previously-\nproposed standards – including Justice Powell‟s fairness standard – to be judicially \n                       \n3  Following Vieth, the Supreme Court has made it clear that even an allegation (which the Partisan \nGerrymander Plaintiffs do not make here) that a map drawn solely for the purpose of partisan political \ngain is insufficient to state a claim for relief.  See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 416-420.  In LULAC, the district \ncourt had found that an unusual mid-decade redistricting was done “solely for the purpose of seizing \nbetween five and seven seats from Democratic incumbents” and that “political gain for the Republicans \nwas 110% of the motivation for the Plan, that it was „the entire motivation,‟” see Session v. Perry, 298 F. \nSupp. 2d 451, 472-473 (E.D. Tex. 2004) (per curiam), and the Supreme Court still rejected the partisan-\ngerrymander claim. \n12 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:205\nunmanageable.  For this reason, Plaintiffs fail to state to state a claim for relief, and this Court \nshould dismiss Counts V and VI. \nB.  The Partisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs’ Claims Should Be Dismissed as Non-\nJusticiable Political Questions \n \nIn Vieth, a plurality of the Supreme Court concluded that partisan gerrymander claims \nwere non-justiciable.  Vieth, 541 U.S. at 278-81.  The plurality opinion in Vieth concluded that \npartisan gerrymander claims, which had produced “[e]ighteen years of judicial effort with \nvirtually nothing to show for it,” are non-justiciable.  Id. at 281.  To the extent that Justice \nKennedy‟s concurrence in the dismissal of the partisan gerrymander claims in Vieth may be \nconstrued to have been based on non-justiciability, id. at 301, Counts V and VI should be \ndismissed as non-justiciable political questions. \nIn the seven years since Vieth, no party has offered a standard any more manageable than \nthose that the Court rejected over the previous 25.  Plaintiffs do not even attempt to do so, and \nthis Court should dismiss the partisan gerrymander claims as non-justiciable political questions. \n  For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs‟ claims in Count V and VI should be dismissed. \nVI.  Plaintiffs Have Pled Themselves Out of Court on All Counts Other than the \n  Partisan Gerrymandering Counts  \n \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs allege that Districts 3, 4, and 5 intentionally dilute or \ngerrymander Latinos‟ votes in violation of Section 2 of the VRA, they plead themselves out of \ncourt.  In its most recent decisions considering a claim of intentional discrimination in the voting \ncontext, the Supreme Court has required plaintiffs to show that race was the predominant factor \nmotivating districting, such that a facially neutral law is “unexplainable on grounds other than \nrace.”  See Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 241, 242 (2001).  Plaintiffs spend nearly half of \n13 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:206\nthe Complaint propounding an alternate explanation, that the Congressional Map, generally, and \nDistricts 3, 4, and 5, in particular, were drawn to protect Democratic interests and incumbents.   \nThe Complaint provides this Court with ample allegations that, accepted as true, establish \nit was political considerations, not race, which dictated the shape of the statewide map.  (Compl. \n¶¶ 4-6, 37-45, 69-101, 129-138).  Plaintiffs also make allegations specific to District 3, 4, and 5, \nthe subjects of all race-based claims in the Complaint.  Plaintiffs call District 3 an “especially \nblatant example of partisan gerrymandering … created to dilute Republican voters by \ndismantling current District 13, represented by seven-term, Republican Congresswoman Judy \nBiggert . . . .” (Compl. ¶ 75) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs highlight District 5 as another district \ndesigned to dismantle current District 13, as well as a district “significantly weighted in favor of \na Democratic candidate” and designed to protect the incumbent in that it contains “72% of \nCongressman Quigley‟s current district.”  (Compl. ¶ 77, 85-86, 91.)  The Complaint also \nspecifically references political concern for protecting Democrats as driving the shape of District \n4.  (Compl. at ¶¶ 5, 85) (discussing District‟s 4 role in the “dismantling” of a Republican \nincumbent‟s district); (Compl. at ¶ 95) (citing District 4‟s role in protecting a Democratic \nincumbent); (Compl. at ¶ 96) (the “significant Chicago suburbs” allegedly divided due to \npartisan motivations include Cicero and Melrose Park, two communities that make up a sizeable \nportion of District 4). \nIn so doing, the Racial Gerrymander Plaintiffs have pled themselves out of court.  See \nMassey v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 464 F.3d 642, 650 (7th Cir. 2006) (A “party may plead itself \nout of court by … including factual allegations that establish an impenetrable defense to its \nclaims”); Tamayo v. Blagojevich, 526 F.3d 1074, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008) (A plaintiff “pleads \nhimself out of court when it would be necessary to contradict the complaint in order to prevail on \n14 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 40  Filed: 08/31/11 Page 15 of 15 PageID #:207\nthe merits …. If the plaintiff voluntarily provides unnecessary facts in her complaint, the \ndefendant may use those facts to demonstrate that she is not entitled to relief”) (citations \nomitted).  In alleging that politics is an explanation for the shape of Districts 3, 4, and 5, and \nstatewide redistricting generally, Plaintiffs have contradicted themselves and alleged a “ground \nother than race.” Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 546.  For these reasons, Count I-IV should be dismissed. \nConclusion \n  WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that this Court dismiss Plaintiffs‟ \nComplaint with prejudice. \n \nDate:  August 31, 2011        Respectfully submitted, \n              LISA MADIGAN,  \nAttorney General for the State of Illinois \n \n \n \n                           /s/ Jon Rosenblatt                    \n                                  Attorney for Defendants                           \n                         \n \nBrent D.

Miller, Jr.\n) (3-judge court convened pursuant to \nDefendants. ) 28 U.S.C. § 2284)\n MOTION TO QUASH THE SUBPOENA OF \nILLINOIS SENATE PRESIDENT JOHN CULLERTON\nDefendants, ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, et al., by and through their\ncounsel, Special Assistant Attorneys General Larry R. Rogers, Sr. and Devon C. Bruce,\nrespectfully moves this Honorable Court for the entry of an Order, in limine, quashing the\nsubpoena of Illinois Senate President John Cullerton.  In support thereof, Defendants state:\n1. This case has been pending since July 27, 2011.  \n2. At no time has Senate President John Cullerton ever been identified as a trial witness in\nthis case by either the plaintiffs or defendants.  As of today’s date, he has still never been\nidentified as a trial witness.\n3. At no time have the plaintiffs made any effort to identify him as a fact witness or take his\ndeposition during the discovery phase of this process.  \n4. Pursuant to this court’s order, all written discovery was required to be completed by\nSeptember 17, 2011.\n5. Furthermore, this court ordered that all oral fact discovery be completed by October 19,\n2011.  During the allocated time for written and oral discovery, President Cullerton was\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 138 Filed: 11/16/11 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:3140\nnever mentioned by the plaintiffs as a individual who would be called as a witness in the\nhearing of this matter.\n6. During the course of discovery in this case, several of the plaintiffs themselves testified to\nalleged conversations with Senate President John Cullerton regarding re-districting.  This\nis knowledge that plaintiffss’ counsel had prior to filing the lawsuit at issue let alone\nduring the discovery phase of this process.  Despite this knowledge, plaintiffs’ counsel\nnever identified him as a witness.\n7. Pursuant to this court’s previous orders, the plaintiffs and the defendants worked together\nto draft a pre-trial order identifying, inter alia, all witnesses who would be called at the\ntrial of this matter.  At no time during the pre-trial order discussions was Senate President\nJohn Cullerton identified as a fact witness in this matter and the pre-trial order did not list\nhim as a witness. \n8. During the late afternoon of November 15th, 2011, approximately 30 hours before the\nhearing of this matter is scheduled to begin, plaintiffs issued a subpoena for President\nJohn Cullerton to be a witness at the trial of this matter.  Plaintiffs did so without leave of\ncourt.  \n9. Plaintiffs’ counsel issued this subpoena in violation of numerous orders of this Court\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\nA. That all written discovery be completed by September 17, 2011; \nB. That all oral fact discovery be completed by October 19, 2011; and\nC. That all witnesses be identified in the pre-trial order by November 7, 2011.\n10. Furthermore, this court has already ruled on the legislative immunity issue with respect\nto Senate President John Cullerton and held that any documents with respect to his\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 138 Filed: 11/16/11 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:3141\ninvolvement in the map re-districting case are protected and excluded.  \n11. It should also be noted that plaintiff’s counsel has previously been admonished by this\ncourt not to issue subpoenas for additional witnesses without leave of court. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs’ counsel previously issued subpoenas in violation of this court’s\ndeadlines with respect to former Congressman Lipinski, Congressman Jackson, Jr. and\nMayor Lawrence J. Morrissey.  Defendant filed a motion to quash those subpoenas. \nDuring the oral argument on that motion, this court stated as follows:\n• “The ground rule is that you can’t– you can’t name new witnesses and just\nsubpoena them for court without a deposition”. (Ex. A- Report of Proceedings\ndated October 20, 2011, p. 16)\n• “We have to stop at some point because this is going to be a huge amount of\nmaterial”. (Ex. A- Report of Proceedings dated October 20, 2011, p. 16)\n• “I don’t know what your- I don’t know what your plan was when you said\ndisclosed witnesses by November 7th.  I would assume that– I mean, typically that\nmeans you have already done the depositions and you have pared down who the\npeople are that you’re going to call— from the discovery you have had”. (Ex. A-\nReport of Proceedings dated October 20, 2011, p. 17)\n12. This court granted the defendants’ request that no further subpoenas be issued.  Clearly,\nthe eleventh hour subpoena on a non-party who has never been identified as a trial\nwitness is untimely and highly prejudicial.\nWherefore, defendants respectfully request that this court quash the subpoena of Senate\nPresident John Cullerton.\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 138 Filed: 11/16/11 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:3142\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/   Devon C.

Rogers, Sr. and Devon C. Bruce, responds\nto Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine to Bar Juan Rangel as follows:\nJuan Rangel is the President and CEO of United Neighborhood Organization (UNO). \n(Ex. K- Rangel dep., p. 11).  UNO is undisputably one of the most significant Latino community\norganizations in the City of Chicago.  The mission of UNO is the empowerment of Hispanic\ncommunities, which includes leadership development programs and involvement in issues\nrelevant to the Hispanic community such as housing, employment, immigration and education.\n(Ex. K- Rangel dep., p. 12)  UNO owns and operates 11 schools in the City of Chicago with over\n5,400 students. (Ex. K- Rangel dep., p. 11)  \nDefendants intend on calling Juan Rangel to testify that both he individually, as well as\nthe organization he represents, supported the map passed by the General Assembly. \nSpecifically, Mr. Rangel is expected to testify that he, UNO and other Latino organizations in\nChicago supported the Congressional map that was passed into law.  He is expected to testify\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 131 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:2988\nsimilar to former Congressman Bill Lipinski that all of the Latino Illinois State legislators voted\nfor and supported the map that was ultimately passed into law.  Specifically, defendants expect\nthere to be testimony that the following legislators are Latino and each voted for the map that\nwas passed into law: Representative Acevedo, Representative Arroyo, Representatives Berrios,\nRepresentative Chapa LaVia, Representative Crespo, Representative Hernandez, Representative\nSoto, Senator Delgado, Senator Munoz, Senator Sandoval and Senator Martinez. (Ex. H-Lipinski\ndep., p. 38-41) Defendants expect that Mr. Rangel to lay the foundation for a photograph which\nhas been disclosed on defendants’ exhibit list that shows Mr. Rangel together with Congressman\nLuis Guitterrez and numerous Latino leaders in Chicago at the time they announced their\ncollective support for the map.  Specifically, Mr. Rangel is expected to testify that the\nindividuals shown in the photograph are: From left to right: Jorge Perez, HACIA, Omar Duque,\nIllinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Maria Socorro Pesqueira, Mujeres Latinas En Accion,\nAlderman George Cardenas, Alderson Danny Solis, Jose Luis Gutierreez, National Alliance of\nLatino American and Caribbean Communities, Senator Martin Sandoval (partially obstructed),\nJuan Rangel, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, Alderman Ricardo Munoz, Senator Tony Munoz,\nElba Aranda-Sub, Spanish Coalition for Jobs, Rep. Edward Acevedo (partially obstructed) and\nRaul Raymundo, Resurrection Project.\nPlaintiffs take issue with the fact that Mr. Rangel did not examine the demographics of\nthe adopted map and did not have direct involvement in the adoption of the map at issue in this\ncase.  However, if this objection were to be applied to the plaintiffs’ fact witnesses, none of the\nplaintiff fact witnesses would be allowed to testify at trial.  As fully set forth in defendants’\nmotion in limine to bar fact witnesses, none of the plaintiffs’ fact witnesses, either congressional\nor non-congressional, have any knowledge whatsoever of the demographic detail of either the\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 131 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:2989\npartisan or the Latino percentages of VAP in any district.  The important distinction between Mr.\nRangel and the plaintiffs’ four non-congressional fact witnesses is that Mr. Rangel is a major,\nundisputed leader in the Latino community here in Chicago. 1  Wherefore, defendants\nrespectfully request that this court deny the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Bar Juan Rangel and allow him\nto testify including to the following topics:\nA. He is the Chief Executive Officer of United Neighborhood Organization, a major\nLatino organization in Chicago; and\nB. He and the organization he serves, the United Neighborhood Organization, plus\nnumerous Latino community organizations and Latino elected officials supported\nthe Congressional map at issue, which includes one Latino majority district; and\nC. That all of the Latino members of the Illinois General Assembly supported the\nCongressional map that was passed into law.\nRespectfully Submitted,\n/s/ Devon C.

Without any of the promised public hearings, the State of Illinois has adopted a\nnew map for the state’s federal congressional districts (the “Proposed Congressional Plan”) that\nblatantly discriminates against Latino and Republican voters.1 As a result of the Proposed\n1 Images of the Proposed Congressional Plan—taken from the Illinois General Assembly’s\nwebsite at http://www.ilga.gov/CongressionalDistrictMaps/Statewide%20View.pdf and at\nhttp://www.ilga.gov/CongressionalDistrictMaps/Cook%20and%20Collar%20County%20View\n.pdf—are attached to this Amended Complaint as Exhibits A and B. Images of the current\ncongressional map—taken from the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Atlas of the United\nStates, available at http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd112_il.pdf—\nare attached to this Amended Complaint as Exhibits C and D. A table reflecting demographic\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 2 of 43 PageID #:1051\nCongressional Plan, Latino voters are packed into a single congressional district racially\ngerrymandered to capture an unnecessarily excessive supermajority of Latino voters, so that the\nvotes of Latinos inside and outside that district are unlawfully diluted. Similarly, the Proposed\nCongressional Plan—which the New York Times has called “[p]erhaps the most aggressive\nexample of partisan maneuvering” to arise out of the 2010 national census2—effectivelyreverses\nthe results of the 2010 congressional elections by redrawing districts so that the citizens of\nIllinois that gave Republicans an 11 to 8 advantage in Illinois’s congressional delegation only\none year ago would see the state’s congressional delegation transformed to one with 12\nDemocrats and only 6 Republicans (with Illinois having lost one seat in national\nreapportionment). Thelawdoes notpermitsuchobviouslydiscriminatorygerrymandering.\n2. By packing excessive numbers of Latino voters into the proposed 4th\ncongressional district, the Proposed Congressional Plan violates the Equal Protection Clause of\ntheFourteenth Amendment,theFifteenth Amendment, and Section2oftheVotingRights Actof\n1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. It sacrifices the interests of Latino voters in favor of preserving and\nstrengthening white majorities in the proposed congressional districts that surround proposed\nDistrict 4—proposed District 3 and proposed District 5. Packing Latino voters into proposed\nDistrict 4 unnecessarily “wastes” the supermajority of Latino votes in that district, while also\ndiluting the influence of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3 and 5. The Proposed\nCongressional Plan converts the District 4 that was created in 1991 in order to provide\nrepresentation to Latinos into one that now denies effective representation to Latinos. That\ninformation about the racial and ethnic composition of the proposed and current congressional\ndistrictsisattachedasExhibitE.\n2 Jennifer Steinhauer, For Republicans, Redistricting Offers Few Gains, New York Times,\nA12(June12,2011).\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 3 of 43 PageID #:1052\nintentional discrimination against Latino voters is precisely the kind of conduct outlawed by\nSection2ofthe VotingRightsAct,theEqual ProtectionClause,andtheFifteenthAmendment.\n3. District 4 of the Proposed Congressional Plan also independently violates the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it is an intentional and\nunjustified racial gerrymander. The tortured “earmuff” shape of District 4, coupled with its\nextremely large Latino population and the judicially established facts about the creation of the\ndistrict after the 1990 census, leave no doubt that race was the predominant factor in drawingthe\ndistrict and that the district therefore is a racial gerrymander. And even if there were a\ncompellingstateinterest in creatingsuch adistrict, proposed District 4 is notnarrowlytailored to\naccomplish that interest. Given the current Latino voting age population in Cook County and\nnearby, the “earmuff” district no longer complies with the Fourteenth Amendment because there\nare other viable and constitutionallypermissible alternatives to proposed District 4. The district,\ntherefore,is unconstitutional.\n4. The Proposed Congressional Plan also is a partisan gerrymander that violates the\nFirst Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The map as a\nwhole and several individual districts in particular represent a flexing of Democratic political\nmuscle in Springfield aimed at creating a Democratic majority in the Illinois congressional\ndelegation, regardless of the actual preferences of the electorate demonstrated onlyone year ago.\nIt dismantles traditional areas of Republican influence such as DuPage County, diluting that\ninfluence across multiple districts, many carefully connected to traditional areas of Democratic\nstrength. At the same time, the map packs Republican incumbents into the same districts or\nsqueezesRepublicanincumbentsintoDemocratic-leaningdistrictswithDemocraticincumbents.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 4 of 43 PageID #:1053\n5. The dismantling of Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert’s current\ncongressional District 13 in Southern DuPage, Northern Will, and Southwestern Cook Counties\nis particularly striking. Under the Proposed Congressional Plan, Republican-leaning portions of\ncurrent District 13 are packed into proposed Districts 6 and 14. The removal of those voters\nfrom current District 13 allows for the creation of proposed District 11, which is a blatantly\ngerrymandered, irregularly shaped district drawn with no apparent reason other than to\nencompass sufficient Democratic voters from Democratic strongholds such as Aurora and Joliet\nto create a new district with a manufactured Democratic majority. Adding insult to injury,\nproposedDistrict5 sweeps inacurvinghookfromthe LakeMichigan shorelineonthenorth side\nof Chicago around the Latino enclaves on Chicago’s west side that are packed into proposed\nDistrict4untilitjustcatches CongresswomanBiggert’s suburban Hinsdalehomeatits verytip.\n6. In short, as another New York Times article noted, “[n]o matter their repeated\nattempts to justify the jigsaw puzzle based on census changes, Democrats took a razor to their\ncolleagues’ domain. They activated every switch at their disposal: clout, secrecy and spools of\nelectronic data that guided block-by-block precision.”3 That back-room precision was used both\ntodisenfranchiseLatinovotersandto guideanoutrageouspartisan gerrymander.\n7. Plaintiffs therefore file this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to\npreventtheuseoftheProposedCongressionalPlaninanyfutureelections.\nII. JURISDICTIONANDVENUE\n8. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343,\nand1357. Plaintiffs bring claims arisingunder theUnited States Constitution,42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nand42U.S.C.§1973for violationsoftheircivilrights andelectivefranchise.\n3 Kristen McQueary, Incumbents Carve Out a New Congressional Map, New York Times,\nA17B (June3,2011).\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 5 of 43 PageID #:1054\n9.

As a result of the decennial national census (hereinafter “the 2010 Census”) and\ncongressional reapportionment,theStateof Illinois lostoneofits existingnineteencongressional\ndistricts. Beginning in the next Congress, Illinois will have eighteen members of the United\nStatesHouseofRepresentatives.\n37. The Illinois General Assembly and the Governor of Illinois are charged with the\nduty to enact a plan for dividing the state into congressional districts. In the 2010 elections,\ndespite gains by Republicans in both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly, Democrats\nretained majority control of both the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate.\nAdditionally, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate won a very close election. As a result, the\nDemocraticPartyenjoys unifiedpartisancontrolofstategovernment.\nA. TheBack-RoomProcessThatResultedInTheProposedCongressionalPlan\n38. The Proposed Congressional Plan was drawn through backroom channels by\nIllinois’s Democratic state legislative leaders, Illinois’s Democratic members of the U.S.\nCongress, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”) and its agents.\nWith respect to areas represented byRepublicans, their (privately) stated intent was to get “more\nDemocratic pick-ups” and to “maximize Democratic performance.” In other parts of the State,\nhowever, the mapmakers monitored and massaged the Latino voting age population in crucial\ndistrictstheywantedtokeepsafeforwhiteincumbents inthefaceofsurgingLatinopopulations.\n39. While the backroom mapmaking proceeded out of public view, members of the\nIllinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate held a series of hearings at locations\naround the state between March 28, 2011 and May 2, 2011 pursuant to 10 ILCS 125/10-5. The\nhearings were conducted by the Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee and the Illinois House\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 10 of 43 PageID #:1059\nRedistricting Committee. The chairpersons of those committees—State Senator Kwame Raoul,\na Democrat, and House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie, also a Democrat—controlled the\nconduct of the hearings.4 Members of the public were permitted to comment, in theory, on the\nredistricting process and their respective communities of interest. However, pursuant to a rule\nestablished by the Democratic chairpersons of the committees, members of the public were not\npermittedto askquestionsofthemembersoftheRedistrictingCommittees. AsstatedbySenator\nRaoul at the first hearing after the state legislative map was released, “We’re taking input today.\nWe’re not fielding questions.”5 In addition, during the purported public hearings, the\nDemocratic-controlled committee never presented any draft or proposed congressional maps or\nredistrictingplan forthe publictoconsider.\n40. With respect to the congressional reapportionment plan, numerous commenters\nurged that “it’s crucial that input be heard after draft maps are released and when we can give\nspecific feedback about how the lines will affect our communities.”6 Moreover, numerous\ncitizen commenters, as well as Republican legislators, implored the Democratic leadership of the\ncommittees to release proposed maps at least one or two weeks before any vote would be taken,\n4 Seehttp://www.ilsenateredistricting.com.\n5 SenatorKwameRaoul, IllinoisStateSenateHearing(May21,2011),at69.\n6 http://www.ilga.gov/senate/Committees/Redistricting/Final%20Approved%20Transcript\n%20for%20Senate%20Redistricting%20Hearing%203.28.11.pdf, at 37.

On May 18, 2011, the Democratic leadership of the Redistricting Committees\nreleased a proposed state legislative map on the Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee website.\nThe congressional map was not released at that time. Redistricting Committees in the Illinois\nSenate and the Illinois House of Representatives held three hearings—on May 21, 22, and 24,\n2011—on the proposed state map. During those meetings, several public commenters pleaded\nfortheimmediatereleaseofthecongressionalmap,tonoavail.9\n7 http://www.ilga.gov/senate/Committees/Redistricting/Final%20Approved%20Transcript\n%20for%20Senate%20Redistricting%20Hearing%203.28.11.pdf, at 63 (“We’d like to call on the\nSenate Redistricting Committee and also the General Assembly to do three -- three of the\nfollowing things: One is to present potential redistricting maps to the public at least one week\nbefore a vote so that communities can have interests and have their input.”); id. at 79 (“And so,\nlastly, as was mentioned with our coalition, what we’re callingon the General Assemblyto do is\npresent the potential redistricting maps at least a week before the vote so that we can provide\ninput.”); id. at 81 (“present potential redistricting maps to the public at least one week before a\nvote so that the communities can provide input”); id. at 89 (“While we appreciate the scheduling\nof these hearings to receive input, we think, as Senator Righter has pointed out, it is also critical\nto have hearings after the relevant legislative committees have developed their proposed maps\nandatleasttwoweeksbeforeanyvoteis taken.”).\n8 Id.at165.\n9 Rev.

At approximately 4:00 a.m., in the early morning hours of Friday, May 27, 2011,\nonly hours before the start of Memorial Day Weekend, the Democratic leadership of the\nRedistricting Committees released a proposed congressional district map, SB 1178, for the first\ntime,postingthe mapon its website. Nopublichearings wereheld.\n43. On Sunday, May 29, 2011, during Memorial Day Weekend, the Redistricting\nCommittee of the Illinois House of Representatives passed SB 1178 on a straight party-line vote\n(6-4). The next day the committee passed an amendment making a modest change to district\nlinesinSouthern Illinois.\n44. On Memorial Day, Monday, May 30, 2011, the full Illinois House of\nRepresentatives took up and passed the bill as amended on a straight party line vote (63-54, with\none Republican voting present). The House debate lasted approximately 40 minutes before a\nvote on the billwas called on an issue that will determine the rights of Illinois voters for the next\ndecade. In committee and on the House floor, Republican members of the House questioned\nwhy the Democratic leadership failed to have public hearings on the Congressional map, failed\nto explain why there was only one majority-Latino district, why the proposed districts appeared\nless compact than the current districts, and why the proposed districts divided recognized\ncommunities ofinterest.\n45. On Monday, May 30, 2011, just hours after the bill passed the House, the\nRedistricting Committee of the Illinois Senate passed the amended bill on a straight party-line\nvote(10-7).\nRedistricting, Joint Illinois Senate and House Hearing (May 24, 2011), at 121, available at\nhttp://ilhousedems.com/redistricting/hearings/Springfield-May-24/95791redistrictinghrg\n05242011FullSize.pdf (“Finally, while these proposals are for the State House and State Senate\nboundaries, the public still has not seen what this body is proposing with regard to the\ncongressional map.

The full Senate passed the bill the next day, again on a straight party line vote\n(34-25). At no time before the General Assembly passed SB 1178 into law did the Democrats\ncontrolling either chamber allow for any public comment on the actual Proposed Congressional\nPlan.\n47.

TheProposedCongressionalPlanDisenfranchisesLatinoVotersbyPackingThem\nintoaSingleCongressionalDistrict\n48. According to the 2010 Census, Latinos are now the largest minority group in the\nStateofIllinois.\n49. Accordingtothe2010Census,thetotalpopulationforIllinoisis 12,830,632.\n50. Ofthattotal,theLatinopopulationis 2,027,578,or15.8%.\n51. The total population for the next largest minority group, African-Americans, is\n1,866,414,or14.5%.\n52. Latinos comprise a growing proportion of the population of Illinois and Cook\nCounty. Statewide, Latinos have increased from 12.3% of all residents in 1990 to 15.8% in\n2010. In the same time period, the Latino population of Cook County has almost doubled,\nincreasingfrom13.6%in1990to24.0%in2010.\n53. Despite Illinois’s large and growing Latino population, the Proposed\nCongressional Plan contains only one majority Latino district, District 4, out of the eighteen\ndistricts created. Latinos make up 65.92% of the proposed District 4 voting age population and\n71.07% of the total population, far more than is necessary to allow the election of a candidate\nwhoisthechoiceof Latinovoters. Nootherproposeddistricthas aLatinovotingagepopulation\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 14 of 43 PageID #:1063\nthat exceeds 25% of the district’s voting age population. But seven other districts have a Latino\nvotingagepopulationthatexceeds10%.\n54. The district with the nextlargest Latino population in the Proposed Congressional\nPlan is proposed District 3, which borders proposed District 4 on the south. Its voting age\npopulation is 24.64% Latino. That figure represents a reduction in the percentage of Latino\nvotingagepopulation in current District3, which is currently29.31% Latino. CongressmanDan\nLipinski, who is white, represents current District 3 and resides in proposed District 3. Proposed\nDistrict 3 was drawn to protect the ability of the white majority in the proposed district to defeat\nthecandidateofchoicefor Latinovoters.\n55. The district that borders proposed District 4 on the north and west is proposed\nDistrict 5. Its voting age population is 16.05% Latino. That figure represents a reduction in the\npercentage of Latino voting age population in current District 5, which is currently 24.56%\nLatino. Congressman Mike Quigley, who is white, represents current District 5 and resides in\nproposed District 5. Proposed District 5 was drawn to protect the abilityof the white majorityin\ntheproposeddistricttodefeatthecandidateofchoicefor Latinovoters.\n56. The Latino population of the State of Illinois and Cook County is\ndisproportionately under the age of 18.

The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally discriminates against and dilutes\nthe votes of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3, 4, and 5—including Plaintiffs Lou Sandoval,\nRalph Rangel, Luis Sanabria, and Michelle Caballero (collectively, the “Racial Dilution\nPlaintiffs”)—by unnecessarily packing Latino voters into proposed District 4 and thereby\nreducingtheLatinovoterpopulationinproposedDistricts3and5.\nC. TheProposedCongressionalPlanImpermissiblyUses RacialGerrymanderingTo\nCreateAMajorityLatinoDistrict\n60. Proposed District 4 is gerrymandered in an “earmuff” shape with the two “muffs”\ncapturing predominately Latino neighborhoods to the north and south of proposed District 7, a\nmajority African-American district. The predominately Latino neighborhoods are connected\nonlybytheearmuff’s “headband,”anarrowstrip runningalongU.S. Interstate294.\n61. A Latino majority district with a very similar shape was created in the same\nlocationafterthe1990 censusinjudicialproceedings overredistricting. Atthattime,thenumber\nof Latinos livingin Cook Countywas roughlyhalf ofits current number,and it was believed that\nthe “earmuff” district was the only way to create a Latino majority congressional district in\nIllinois. TheLatinovotingagepopulationinthepost-1990District4was 59.18%.\n62. Judicial proceedings concerning the post-1990 District 4 established that race—\nthatis,Latinoethnicity—wasthepredominant considerationinthecreationofthatdistrict.\n63. Latino ethnicity was the predominant consideration in the creation of proposed\nDistrict4. No other factor explains the “earmuff” shapeoftheproposed district or the extremely\nhighconcentrationof Latinovoters intheproposeddistrict.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 16 of 43 PageID #:1065\n64. Proposed District 4 is far less compact than other districts in the Proposed\nCongressionalPlan.\n65. Proposed District 4’s 0.05 Circularity Ratio—i.e., the ratio of the area of the\nproposed districts to the area of a circle having the same perimeter—is the lowest of any district\nin the Proposed Congressional Plan.

It is also lower than the Plan’s average of 0.61. Smaller numbers indicate less\ncompactness.\n68. Proposed District 4 is not narrowly tailored to serve the State of Illinois’s interest\nin complying with Section 2 of Voting Rights Act.

TheProposedCongressionalPlanIs GerrymanderedtoDisproportionatelyFavor\nDemocraticCandidates\n70. Working together, the Democratic leadership of the Illinois General Assembly,\nthe DCCC, its agents, and certain Democratic members of Congress developed the Proposed\n16\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 17 of 43 PageID #:1066\nCongressional Plan byengagingin impermissible partisan gerrymandering that dilutes theability\nofRepublicanvotersin Illinoistoelectcandidates oftheirchoice.\n71. Illinois is relatively evenly divided between Republican and Democratic voters.\nFrom 1999 to 2005 and again from 2011 to the present, Illinois has been represented in the\nUnited States Senate by one Republican and one Democratic senator. Republicans held the\noffice of Governor of Illinois from 1977 to 2003, and Democrats have held it from 2003 to the\npresent. In the 2010 Illinois United States Senate race, Republican Candidate Mark Kirk\nreceived 48.01% of the vote, while Democratic Candidate Alexi Giannoulias received 46.42%.\nSimilarly, in the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, Democratic Candidate Pat Quinn received\n46.79%ofthevote,whileRepublicanBillBradyreceived45.94%.\n72. The Illinois congressional delegation has been similarly divided between\nRepublicans and Democrats. Following the 2002 elections, there were 10 Republican and 9\nDemocratic Congressmen from Illinois. In 2004, 9Republican and 10 Democratic Congressmen\nwere elected. In 2006, 8 Republican and 11 Democratic Congressmen were elected. In 2008, 7\nRepublicanand12DemocraticCongressmen wereelected.\n73. In 2010, voters rejected four Democratic incumbents in favor of Republican\nchallengers and elected a Republican candidate to the seat vacated as a result of Republican\nCongressman Mark Kirk’s decision to run for United States Senate, resulting in a delegation of\n11Republicanand8DemocraticCongressmen.\n74. Despitethe2010 Congressionalelection results and therelativelyeven division of\nvoters between parties in Illinois, the Proposed Congressional Plan creates a situation in which\nthe Illinois Congressional delegation is likely to go from its current composition of 11\nRepublicansand8Democratstoonly6Republicansand12Democrats.\n17\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 18 of 43 PageID #:1067\n75. According to the Partisan Voting Index developed by Charlie Cook (“PVI”), the\nmost widely used and accepted measure of partisan leanings for congressional districts, the\nProposed Congressional Plan increases the number of districts that favor Democrats bynearly20\npercentage points.10 Nine of the 19 Illinois congressional districts (47.4%) have Democratic-\nleaning PVIscores under the current congressional plan, which was adopted through a bipartisan\nprocess in 2001. By contrast, under the Proposed Congressional Plan, 12 of the 18 Illinois\ncongressionaldistricts (66.7%)have Democratic-leaningPVIscores.\n76. The Proposed Congressional Plan accomplishes that result by packing traditional\nRepublican voters statewide into a relatively small number of proposed districts and then\ndividing the remaining Republican voters into districts that include reliable majorities of\nDemocraticvoters.\n77. While the entire Proposed Congressional Plan reflects a statewide partisan\ngerrymander, proposed District 11 is an especially blatant example of partisan gerrymandering.\nThat district was created by dismantling current District 13, represented by seven-term,\nRepublican Congresswoman Judy Biggert, the only woman in the current Republican\ncongressional delegation. Current District 13 is located in southern DuPage, northern Will, and\nsouthwestern Cook Counties and encompasses a number of western and southwestern suburbs of\n10 The PVI is a measurement of how strongly a congressional district leans toward one political\nparty compared to the nation as a whole. The index for each congressional district is derived by\naveraging its results from the prior two presidential elections and comparing them to national\nresults. The index indicates which party’s candidate was more successful in that district, as well\nas the number of percentage points bywhich its results exceeded the national average. The index\nis formatted as a letter followed by a plus sign and then a number. For instance, in a district\nwhose PVI score is D+2, a generic Democratic candidate would be expected to receive 2\npercentage points more votes than the national average. An “Even” score is assigned when the\ndistrictperformedwithin halfapointofthenationalaverage.\n18\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 19 of 43 PageID #:1068\nChicago such as Bolingbrook, Naperville, Orland Park, Downers Grove, Westmont, and\nWoodridge.\n78. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the Republican candidate received\n53.66%ofthevoteincurrentDistrict13,whiletheDemocraticcandidatereceived38.49%.\n79. The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally slices current District 13 into six\nproposed Districts (proposed Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 11, and 14) in order to dilute the influence of\nRepublicanvoters.\n80. The Proposed Congressional Plan first packs Republican enclaves in Naperville\nand Downers Grove into proposed Districts 6 and 14, resulting in new districts whose electorate\nis overwhelminglyRepublican.\n81. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 6\nvoted57.79%fortheRepublicancandidateand34.59%fortheDemocraticcandidate.\n82. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 14\nvoted57.19%fortheRepublicancandidateand32.91%forDemocraticcandidate.\n83. Bypacking Republican voters into proposed Districts 6 and 14, the drafters of the\nProposed Congressional Plan were able to create a new, snake-shaped proposed District 11\ncentered around Aurora, Bolingbrook, and Joliet that combines just enough Democratic enclaves\nin those communities to give the proposed district a likely majority of Democratic voters,\ndilutingthevotesofRepublicanvoterscapturedintheconnectingsegments.\n84.

However,\nin the 2008 Presidential election, the electorate of proposed District 11 voted 61.10% for the\nDemocratic candidate and 37.01% for the Republican candidate. Similarly, in the 2006 Illinois\n19\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 20 of 43 PageID #:1069\ngubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 11 voted 46.82% for the Democratic\ncandidate and 40.16% for the Republican candidate.

In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 5\nvoted36.17%fortheRepublicancandidateand54.18%fortheDemocraticcandidate.\n87. Further evidencing its partisan animus, the Proposed Congressional Plan draws\nsome Republican incumbents into the same districts, forcing them to run against each other or\nmove, while it also places Republican incumbents in Democratic-leaning districts with\nDemocraticincumbents.\n88. The Proposed Congressional Plan places incumbent Republican Congressmen Joe\nWalsh and Randy Hultgren in proposed District 14, forcing them to run against each other in the\nRepublicanprimaryormove.\n89.

Instead, it manufactures a Latino voting age supermajority of 65.92% by\npackingLatinoresidentsintoanearmuff-shapeddistrictsobizarre onitsfacethatraceis theonly\nexplanationfortheshapeanddemographiccompositionoftheDistrict.\n126.

Count V is brought by the Partisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs against the Individual\nBoardMemberDefendantsintheirofficialcapacities.\n131. The Proposed Congressional Plan—on a statewide basis and in proposed Districts\n11, 13, and 17—intentionally and unreasonably dilutes the votes of Republican voters in a\nmanner that gives Republican voters a far smaller chance of electing candidates of their choice\nthanwouldresultfromtraditional,non-partisanredistricting.\n132. The Proposed Congressional Plan satisfies Plaintiffs’ proposed standard for\njudging partisan gerrymander claims. That standard has an intent requirement and an effect\nrequirement.\n133. The intent requirement demands direct or circumstantial proof that the State’s\nmapmakers created one or more congressional districts with the predominant intent to secure\npartisan advantage. That requirement is met by (a) the evidence that the State of Illinois’s\nmapmakers (including Democratic leaders of the General Assembly and the DCCC) had the\nadmitted goal of maximizing what they called “Democratic pickups” in areas represented by\nRepublicans, (b) the way proposed Districts 11, 13, and 17 are bizarrely shaped to capture\nheavily Democratic areas in Joliet, Aurora, Rockford, Peoria, Springfield, Bloomington/Normal,\nandChampaign/Urbana,and(c)thecompletedismantlingofcurrentDistrict13.\n134. The effect requirement demands a showing of three things: (1) that the Proposed\nCongressional Plan increases the number of districts that favor Democrats by at least 10%\naccording to an accepted measure of partisan voting; (2) that the Proposed Congressional Plan\n28\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 29 of 43 PageID #:1078\nkeeps at least 10% more constituents of Democratic incumbents in the same district as their\nrepresentative than it does constituents of Republican incumbents; and (3) that at least one of the\ndistricts created with the intent to advantage Democrats is among the districts that contributes to\nthe proof of elements 1 and 2. The Proposed Congressional Plan increases the number of\ndistricts that favor Democrats by over 19% according to the PVI, and it keeps 53.4% more\nconstituents of Democratic incumbents in the same district as their representative than it does\nconstituents of Republican incumbents. Proposed Districts 11, 13, and 17 all have Democratic-\nleaning PVI scores and incumbent-constituent overlap figures that are far below the overlap\nfiguresforanyproposed districtswithDemocratic incumbents.\n135. As a result, the Proposed Congressional Plan burdens and penalizes the Partisan\nGerrymander Plaintiffs’ exercise of their freedom of association, their right to express political\nviews, and their right to petition the government for redress of grievances. In particular, the\nProposed Congressional Plan deters potential Republican congressional candidates from\nexercising their right to run for office by making a Republican candidacy futile, and it deters\npotential Republican voters from casting ballots that are likely to be meaningless. In addition,\nthoseDemocratic members ofCongress from Illinois whoseelection is effectivelyassured bythe\nProposed Congressional Plan’s partisan gerrymandering will necessarily pay little if any heed to\ntheir Republican constituents, effectively depriving them of representation based on their\npoliticalaffiliation.\n136.

The Proposed Congressional Plan satisfies Plaintiffs’ proposed standard for\njudging partisan gerrymander claims. That standard has an intent requirement and an effect\nrequirement.\n141. The intent requirement demands direct or circumstantial proof that the State’s\nmapmakers created one or more congressional districts with the predominant intent to secure\npartisan advantage. That requirement is met by (a) the evidence that the State of Illinois’s\nmapmakers (including Democratic leaders of the General Assembly and the DCCC) had the\nadmitted goal of maximizing what they called “Democratic pickups” in areas represented by\nRepublicans, (b) the way proposed Districts 11, 13, and 17 are bizarrely shaped to capture\nheavily Democratic areas in Joliet, Aurora, Rockford, Peoria, Springfield, Bloomington/Normal,\nandChampaign/Urbana,and(c)thecompletedismantlingofcurrentDistrict13.\n142. The effect requirement demands a showing of three things: (1) that the Proposed\nCongressional Plan increases the number of districts that favor Democrats by at least 10%\naccording to an accepted measure of partisan voting; (2) that the Proposed Congressional Plan\n30\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 103  Filed: 11/04/11 Page 31 of 43 PageID #:1080\nkeeps at least 10% more constituents of Democratic incumbents in the same district as their\nrepresentative than it does constituents of Republican incumbents; and (3) that at least one of the\ndistricts created with the intent to advantage Democrats is among the districts that contributes to\nthe proof of elements 1 and 2. The Proposed Congressional Plan increases the number of\ndistricts that favor Democrats by over 19% according to the PVI, and it keeps 53.4% more\nconstituents of Democratic incumbents in the same district as their representative than it does\nconstituents of Republican incumbents. Proposed Districts 11, 13, and 17 all have Democratic-\nleaning PVI scores and incumbent-constituent overlap figures that are far below the overlap\nfiguresforanyproposed districtswithDemocratic incumbents.\n143. As a result, the Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally treats the Partisan\nGerrymander Plaintiffs differently and worse than it treats similarly situated voters who are\nDemocrats. And the Plan does so because the Partisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs are Republicans.\nAccordingly, the Proposed Congressional Plan violates the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made actionable in this suit by 42\nU.S.C.§1983.\n* * *\n144.

See 10/12/11 \nOpinion and Order [Doc. #77] at 6 (“Proof of discriminatory intent is required for plaintiffs to \nprevail on their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment racial discrimination claims” and “has also \nbeen found sufficient, though not necessary, to sustain a VRA claim”); id. at 8 (“Plaintiffs allege \nmany of [the totality of the circumstance] factors in their Complaint.”); id. at 15-16 (“Plaintiffs \nraise profound questions about the legitimacy of the redistricting process and the viability of the \n2011 Map.”).  \nBut  the  reply  brief  also  offers  two  new  arguments  that  Plaintiffs  have  not  had  the \nopportunity to address: First, as to Plaintiffs’ intentional discrimination claims (Counts I through \nIII), Defendants now argue that the proportionality inquiry must focus on citizen voting age \npopulation, not voting age population. Second, as to Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander claims \n(Counts V and VI), Defendants invoke a recent decision from a federal district court in Texas \nthat  dismissed  partisan  gerrymander  claims  because  the  plaintiffs  had  not  put  forward  an \nacceptable standard. In order to address these new arguments—which are both meritless—\nPlaintiffs hereby file this limited surreply. \nI.  Defendants’ Argument Regarding Citizen Voting Age Population Is Meritless.  \nAbandoning their opening brief’s ludicrous claim (at 6) that proportionality is a “district-\nspecific” concept, Defendants now argue (at 5-6) that the Complaint improperly focuses on the \ngross disparity between Illinois’s 15.8% Latino voting age population and the 5.6% of majority-\nLatino districts in Illinois’s congressional redistricting plan. According to Defendants (at 6), the \nComplaint should instead have focused on “citizen voting-age population,” which Defendants \nnow claim is “the ‘proper benchmark’ for measuring proportionality.”  \nDefendants’ argument is absurd—and wrong. To begin with, it is remarkably untethered \n1 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 83 Filed: 10/17/11 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:824\n \nfrom the standard that governs motions to dismiss. Defendants cannot plausibly claim that they \nlack  notice  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  simply  because  the  Complaint  uses  voting  age  population \n(“VAP”)  rather  than  citizen  voting  age  population  (“CVAP”).  Regardless  of  the  “proper \nbenchmark” for one of a number of relevant factors, the Complaint “give[s] enough details about \nthe subject-matter of the case to present a story that holds together” (Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., \n614 F.3d 400, 404 (7th Cir. 2010)), which is all that it must do to survive a motion to dismiss.  \nBut  the  most  fundamental  problem  with  Defendants’  argument  is  that  VAP—not \nCVAP—is the proper benchmark. “[A]pportionment is based on Census returns,” and all other \n“estimates about population . . . don’t matter” in redistricting challenges. Gonzalez v. City of \nAurora, Illinois, 535 F.3d 594, 597 (7th Cir. 2008). Prior to the 2010 Census, each decennial \nCensus included questions on citizenship, and each Census report contained CVAP numbers. See \nU.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census – American FactFinder (noting that the 2000 Census \nincluded questions on citizenship)1; Gonzalez, 535 F.3d at 596 (listing CVAP figures from 2000 \nCensus). The 2010 Census eliminated questions on citizenship. See Kerry Pickett, 2010 Census \nLacks Citizenship Question, WASH. TIMES, Jan. 11, 2010. As a result, the 2010 Census does not \nreport CVAP numbers; it reports only VAP numbers, making VAP the appropriate benchmark. \nTo be sure, one may try to estimate CVAP. And Defendants’ expert appears to have done \nso by relying on “the American Community Survey sample.” See Expert Report of Allan J. \nLichtman Re: Plaintiffs’ Allegations of Intentional Vote Dilution & Racial Predominance in \nRedistricting (Oct. 4, 2011) at 13. But, as the U.S. Census Bureau makes clear, “[those numbers] \nare not the 2010 Census population counts.” U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, \nhttp://www.census.gov/acs/www/.  Any  estimates  drawn  from  that  sample  therefore  “don’t \n                                                 \n1  http://factfinder.census.gov/jsp/saff/SAFFInfo.jsp?_lang=en&_sse=on&_content=sp4_ \ndecennial.html&_title=Decennial+Census. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 83 Filed: 10/17/11 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:825\n \nmatter.” Gonzalez, 535 F.3d at 597.  \nBecause  the  2010  Census  does  not  contain  CVAP  numbers,  VAP  is  the  relevant \nbenchmark. Thus, the disproportionality factor is satisfied.  \nII.  Nothing  In  Perez  v.  Texas  Requires  This  Court  To  Dismiss  Plaintiffs’  Partisan \nGerrymandering Claims.  \nDefendants never dispute that “a complaint need not contain legal theories” (Aaron v. \nMahl, 550 F.3d 659, 666 (7th Cir. 2008)) or “do more than narrate a plausible claim for relief” \n(Morrison v. YTB Int’l, Inc., 649 F.3d 533, 538 (7th Cir. 2011)). But Defendants jettison (at 9-\n11) this well-established body of law in seeking dismissal of Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander \nclaims based on the reading that the district court in Perez v. Texas (W.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2011) \n(Ex. A to Defs’ Reply Br.) recently gave to Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Vieth v. Jubelirer, \n541 U.S. 267 (2004).  \nThe Perez court held that Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Vieth required dismissal of \npartisan gerrymander claims where the plaintiffs did not articulate an acceptable standard for \njudging such claims. Speaking for only himself, Justice Kennedy took a similar position in Vieth. \nAnd the Perez court believed that aspect of Justice Kennedy’s concurrence was “controlling, \nbecause it is the ‘position taken by those Members [of the Court] who concurred in the judgment \non the narrowest grounds.’” Slip op. at 21 (quoting Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 \n(1977)).  \nPerez misapplies the “Marks test,” under which the so-called “narrowest” concurrence is \ntreated as controlling. Subsequent to Marks, the Supreme Court has held that “[w]e think it not \nuseful to pursue the Marks inquiry to the utmost logical possibility when it has so obviously \nbaffled and divided the lower courts that have considered it.” Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. \n738, 745-46 (1994). Moreover, “[s]ince Marks, several members of the [Supreme] Court have \n3 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 83 Filed: 10/17/11 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:826\n \nindicated that whenever a decision is fragmented such that no single opinion has the support of \nfive Justices, lower courts should examine the plurality, concurring and dissenting opinions to \nextract the principles that a majority has embraced.” United States v. Johnson, 467 F.3d 56, 65 \n(1st Cir. 2006). \nApplying this correct standard to Vieth, controlling weight should not be given to Justice \nKennedy’s view that complaints failing to articulate an acceptable standard should be dismissed. \nNo other Justice in Vieth agreed that a complaint could be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for \nfailure to articulate a reliable legal standard. The plurality correctly noted that Justice Kennedy’s \nsuggested disposition is “not legally available,” because “it is our job, not the plaintiffs’, to \nexplicate the standard that makes the facts alleged by the plaintiffs adequate or inadequate to \nstate a claim.” 541 U.S. at 301. The four dissenting Justices did not disagree with the plurality on \nthat point, all voting against dismissal. Thus, what controls in Vieth is the eight-Justice majority \nthat disagreed with Justice Kennedy’s rationale for dismissal.2  \nThe Vieth concurrence would upend federal pleading standards and offers no reason why \na partisan gerrymander claim should be treated differently from any other claim under the Rule \n12(b)(6) analysis. Moreover, the Vieth concurrence has been superseded by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, in \nwhich Justice Kennedy wrote on behalf of a majority that “[w]hen there are well-pleaded factual \nallegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give \nrise to an entitlement to relief.” 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009). Under Iqbal, all that matters are a \n                                                 \n2 LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006), also offers no support for Defendants. Both Perez (slip \nop. at 21) and Defendants (at 10) quote from Part II.B. of Justice Kennedy’s opinion in LULAC, \nbut—once more—no other Justice joined Justice Kennedy on that point. Moreover, the passage \nin question simply stated that “a successful claim attempting to identify unconstitutional acts of \npartisan gerrymandering must . . . show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, on the \ncomplainants’ representational rights.” Id. at 418. Plaintiffs’ Complaint satisfies that test. The \nComplaint alleges facts that “show a burden” on Plaintiffs’ “representational rights” under any \n“reliable standard” that this Court might adopt. \n4 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 83 Filed: 10/17/11 Page 9 of 9 PageID #:827\n \ncomplaint’s well-pleaded factual allegations; it is the court’s role to determine whether those \nfactual allegations “give rise to an entitlement to relief.” Id. \nPerez is also distinguishable. In Perez, the plaintiffs “were given an opportunity” to \n“identif[y]” a justiciable standard. Slip op. at 21. Here, Plaintiffs have not had that opportunity. \nThe sole dispute at this point is whether the Complaint must “contain legal theories.” See Aaron, \n550  F.3d  at  666.  Should  this  Court  conclude  that  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  must  articulate  a \njusticiable standard for partisan gerrymanders, then Plaintiffs should be given leave to file an \namended pleading that offers such a standard. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss. \n \nDated: October 17, 2011        Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Lori E.

Rogers, Sr. and Devon C. Bruce, \nrespectfully moves this Honorable Court for the entry of an Order, in limine, barring plaintiffs’ \nfact witnesses from testifying at the trial of this matter.  In support thereof, Defendants state: \nIntroduction \n \nPlaintiffs have alleged in their complaint that the 2011 Illinois congressional map that \npassed both chambers of the Illinois legislature and was signed into law is unconstitutional in \nthat (1) it violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and (2) it is the result of political \ngerrymandering.  A number of courts addressing re-districting cases involving similar types of \nconstitutional allegations have held that the decisions in these matters rise and fall largely based \nupon the parties’ expert testimony. Barnett v. Daley, 1995 WL 59229 (N.D.Ill., Feb. 10, 1995); \nIllinois Legislative Redistricting Commission v. LaPaille, 786 F.Supp. 704 (N.D.Ill.1992).  This \ncourt has indicated as much in this case already: “I have already told (you) – we have told you \nthat we don’t think these witnesses are going to make a heck of a lot of difference.” (Ex. A - \nReport of Proceedings dated 10/20/11 at p. 16.)   Despite this court’s admonishment and defense \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:2055\ncounsel’s requests to plaintiffs’ counsel to limit the number of fact witnesses or exchange \ndeposition designations, plaintiffs’ counsel has insisted that they intend on calling no fewer than \n10 fact witnesses during this short hearing.  For the reasons set forth below, defendants move in \nlimine to bar the testimony of 9 of the 10 plaintiff fact witnesses in their entirety or, in the \nalternative, at least bar these witnesses from testifying to certain topics, as described below.1 \nFactual Background \nCongresswoman Judith Biggert  \nCongresswoman Biggert never attended any Illinois re-districting committee hearings \nand never sent anyone on her behalf. (Ex. F - Biggert dep., p. 46)  She never submitted a letter, \ndraft map or provided any input as to how she believed the map should be drawn before the \nadopted map was passed into law. (Ex. F - Biggert dep., p. 46)  Congresswoman Biggert never \nspoke to anyone who was involved in the drawing of the map. (Ex F - Biggert dep., p. 44)  She \nhas no knowledge of the map-making process. (Ex. F - Biggert dep., p. 43)  She does not know \nanything about who drew the adopted map or what factors were considered by the map drawers \nin Springfield. (Ex. F - Biggert dep., p. 44)  She never made any effort to speak to the re-\ndistricting committees while the legislature was going through the re-districting process. (Ex. F -\nBiggert dep., p. 57)  Furthermore, she has no knowledge of the “demographic makeup” of the \nplaintiffs’ own map, including the Latino VAP in these districts proposed by plaintiffs. (Ex. F -\nBiggert dep., p. 55-56)  She has never been told by anyone that the adopted map was \nintentionally drawn to discriminate against Latinos. (Ex. F - Biggert dep., p. 45-46) She has no \nknowledge of the demographic make-up of the map that was passed into law. (Ex. F - Biggert \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiffs have indicated that they may call one other fact witness, Ed Marshall.  (See \n[Proposed] Pre-Hearing Order, filed November 7, 2011.)  Mr. Marshall is the subject of a \nseparate Motion in Limine. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:2056\ndep., p. 46)  She has no knowledge of the demographic make-up of the map being offered by the \nplaintiffs. (Ex. F - Biggert dep., p. 55) \nCongressman Donald Manzullo  \nCongressman Manzullo thinks he retained counsel before the map in Springfield was \npassed into law. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., p. 34)  He never went to any Illinois re-districting \ncommittee hearings or submitted information to them.  Congressman Manzullo did not know if \nthere were Republican members on the Illinois Re-Districting Committee. (Ex. B - Manzullo \ndep., pp. 31-32, 35-37, 49)  He does not know the identity or intent of those individuals who \ndrew the adopted map. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., pp. 16-17)  He believes that the intent was to give \n5-6 Republicans very difficult districts; however, he testified he has no first hand knowledge of \nthis. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., pp. 16-17)  No one ever told him that the intent of the drawers of \nthe map was to discriminate against minorities. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., pp. 30-31)  He is \nunaware of any minority groups that have objected to the new map. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., p. \n51)2  Congressman Manzullo has no opinion as to whether the 17th Congressional District was \ndrawn for partisan purposes: “I really do not have an opinion on that.” (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., p. \n32)   Just like Congressman Shimkus, Congressman Manzullo testified that he was going to win \nregardless of whether he runs under the adopted map or the Republican map: “I’m going to win \n                                                           \n2 Congressman Manzullo claimed that there were no minority groups in Rockford to voice \nobjections because “I have always represented them”. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., pp. 51-52) \nIronically, plaintiffs’ counsel chose to depose Rockford Mayor Lawrence J. Morrissey (over \ndefendants’ objection), who flatly contradicted Congressman Manzullo.  Mayor Morrissey \nidentified a number of Latino and African-American community groups that are present in \nRockford, including La Voz Latina, LULAC, Mexican American Chamber of Commerce and the \nNAACP. (Ex. G - Morrissey dep., pp. 54-55)  To the Mayor’s knowledge, none of these minority \ngroups raised any objections to the adopted map.  (Ex. G - Morrissey dep., pp. 52,57)  In fact, a \nprominent local member of the minority community in Rockford, Representative Chuck \nJefferson, publicly voted to support the adopted map. (Ex. G - Morrissey dep., pp. 52-53)  Mayor \nMorrissey went on to explain the benefits of having Rockford divided into two Congressional \ndistricts.  (Ex. G - Morrissey dep., pp. 47-49) \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:2057\nin either district because I’ve represented most of that area for the past 18 years.” (Ex. B -\nManzullo dep., p. 42) \nCongressman Peter Roskam \nCongressman Roskam does not know the names of the individuals who drew the map. \n(Ex. D - Roskam dep., p. 23)  Congressman Roskam has no knowledge of the intent of the \nindividuals who created the adopted map. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., p. 24)  He had no involvement \nin the Illinois re-districting process. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., pp. 36-39)  He neither attended any of \nthe re-districting committee meetings nor sent anyone of his behalf. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., p. 36-\n37) He never attempted to provide the re-districting committee with any alternative maps, \nalthough nothing precluded him from doing so. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., p. 37)  No one has told \nhim that the intent in drawing the map that was passed into law was to discriminate against \nminorities. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., p. 24)  He cannot say that the adopted map is less \nadvantageous for him than the map the plaintiffs themselves are proposing. (Ex. D - Roskam \ndep., p. 44)  \nCongressman John Shimkus \nCongressman Shimkus had retained counsel in early Spring or mid-April.  Congressman \nShimkus does not know who drew the adopted map that was passed into law. (Ex. E - Shimkus \ndep., pp. 51-54)  He never spoke to anyone involved in Springfield about the intent of the map \ndrawing.  (Ex. E - Shimkus dep., p. 97)  He attended none of the Illinois re-districting committee \nhearings himself; nor did he have anyone attend these meeting on his behalf; nor did he provide \nany maps or have his counsel do so. (Ex. E - Shimkus dep., pp. 113-18, 122, 124-25)  He has no \nknowledge that the adopted map was intended by the drafters to discriminate against Latinos. \n(Ex. E - Shimkus dep., pp. 99-102)  In contradiction to the plaintiffs’ complaint, Congressman \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:2058\nShimkus said prior to the adoption of the map that he was willing to accept a map with only one \nLatino majority district. (Ex. H - Lipinski dep., pp. 34-36)  Despite plaintiffs’ claim of \ndisadvantage under the new map, Congressman Shimkus has no knowledge about the percentage \nof Democrats or Republicans in any Congressional district in Southern Illinois under the map \nthat has passed into law. (Ex. E - Shimkus dep., p. 21) Congressman Shimkus summarized his \nknowledge of the map up by simply stating, “all the information I have on the map is based \nupon privileged communication with my attorneys.” (Ex. E - Shimkus dep., pp. 26-27)  Upon \nfurther questioning about percentages of Democratic versus Republican voters in the newly \nadopted 15th District, Congressman Shimkus continued to maintain that all of the information he \nhad was based on attorney-client privilege. (Ex. E - Shimkus dep., pp. 35-37) \nArgument \nI.  The four Congressional plaintiffs should be barred from offering testimony \nas they possess no knowledge as to the allegations in the plaintiffs’ amended \ncomplaint \n \n  A.  The Congressional plaintiffs should be barred from testifying that \nthey were deprived of participation in the re-districting process \n \n Both the original and amended complaints are replete with allegations of a “back room \nmap making process” and the plaintiffs themselves testified that they were “shut out” of the \nprocess. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., p. 31)  The facts obtained in discovery, however, reveal that the \nplaintiffs retained the law firm of Mayer Brown in this matter as early as December 2010 or \nJanuary 2011, long before the re-districting process had even begun.  (Ex. C - Schock dep., p. \n17.)  None of the Congressional plaintiffs attended any of the numerous Illinois Re-Districting \nCommittee hearings held throughout the State.  None of the plaintiffs or their counsel submitted \nany proposed ideas, thoughts or maps to the Re-Districting Committee as to how they believed \nthe map should have been drawn.  It is undisputed that nothing prevented the plaintiffs from \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:2059\ndoing so. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., p. 37)  In short, neither the plaintiffs, nor their counsel, made \nany attempt to participate in the re-districting process and thus should be barred on foundational \ngrounds from offering testimony or opinions that they were “shut out” of the process or that it \nwould not have made a difference if they had chosen to do so (which they did not).  Put simply, \nthe plaintiffs should not be allowed to testify that they were deprived of participating in the re-\ndistricting process when they never made any attempt to do so. \n  B.  The Congressional plaintiffs should be barred from testifying as to \nhow or why the adopted map was created \n \nAs became clear in discovery, the Congressional plaintiffs do not know who drew the \nmap at issue.  The Congressional plaintiffs do not know what factors the drafters relied upon in \ndrawing the map.  None of the Congressional plaintiffs have any knowledge that the map was \ndrawn to intentionally discriminate against the Latinos, which goes to the heart of the alleged \nviolations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Lastly, the Congressional plaintiffs either \nclaimed not to have analyzed the demographics of the newly adopted map in order to determine \nwith any detail the political ramifications of the map or they refused to answer questions about \nthe political composition of the map. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., p. 14; Ex. E - Shimkus dep., pp. 21, \n26-27)  The Congressional plaintiffs clearly are unhappy with the adopted map and would like to \n“say their peace”.  As the court already has pointed out, however, in granting defendants’ motion \nto quash the deposition subpoena for Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., “every Congressman has a \npolitical opinion about it.” (Ex. A - Report of Proceedings dated 10/20/11 at p. 12)  Nevertheless, \nallowing the Congressional plaintiffs to make broad, conclusory statements about why they \nbelieve the map was drawn the way it was is rank speculation when they lack knowledge about \nwho drew the map, what factors the drafters relied upon or the details of the political \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:2060\nramifications of the map.  See, e.g., Alston v. King, 231 F. 3d 383, 387 (7th Cir. 2000) (affirming \nthe exclusion of evidence that both lacked foundation and was speculative). \n  C.  The Congressional plaintiffs should be barred from testifying about \nalleged out of court statements made by non-parties  \n \nSeveral of the Congressional plaintiffs testified in their depositions to various \nconversations they claim they had with non-party individuals about the map.  These individuals \nwho the Congressional plaintiffs claim to have spoken to include Illinois Senate President John \nCullerton, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, Congressman Jerry Costello, former \nCongressman William Lipinski, Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., State Senator Bill Haine and \nState Representative Dan Beiser.  All of these alleged statements are plain hearsay and as such \nthe Congressional plaintiffs should not be allowed to testify to these alleged conversations with \nnon-parties. See, e.g., U.S. v. Lane, 323 F.3d 568, 584 (7th Cir. 2003) (affirming exclusion of \nconversation as inadmissible hearsay).  Specifically, defendants expect the plaintiffs to attempt to \nelicit testimony from Congressman Shimkus and Congressman Costello regarding a compromise \nthat they attempted to reach regarding the congressional boundaries of a map.  Not only are \nCongressman Costello’s out of court statements hearsay, the whole topic area is irrelevant.  A \ncompromise was not reached between these two Congressmen and any map that they discussed \nwas not adopted into law and has no bearing on the issues in this case. \n  D.  The Congressional plaintiffs should be barred from testifying \nregarding the plaintiffs’ “Republican” map \n \nAs part of the plaintiffs’ case, the plaintiffs have proffered a self-styled “Fair and \nBalanced Map” candidly referred to by plaintiff Congressman Manzullo as the “Republican \nMap”. (Ex. B - Manzullo dep., pp. 40, 41)   During the depositions of each of the Congressional \nplaintiffs, they denied any substantive knowledge about this “Republican” Map.  The \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:2061\nCongressional plaintiffs either did not know or were precluded by their counsel from answering \nany questions about the partisan make-up of the “Republican” map or the percentage of Latino \nVAP in a particular district or any other details about the partisan make-up of the plaintiffs’ \nproffered map. (Ex. D - Roskam dep., pp. 44-45; Ex. C - Schock dep., pp. 48-49; Ex. E - \nShimkus dep., pp. 135-36)  As such, the plaintiffs should be precluded from offering any such \ndetails at the hearing and leave such testimony, if any, to the experts. \n  E.  The Congressional plaintiffs should be barred from offering testimony \nor opinions about the political ramifications of the adopted map \n \nSurprisingly, several of the Congressional plaintiffs testified to their likelihood of \nprevailing under the adopted map, which refutes the plaintiffs’ gerrymandering contention \nentirely.  For example, Congressman Shimkus testified that “it would be very difficult for a \ndistrict to be drawn in Southwestern Illinois that I cannot win in”. (Ex. E - Shimkus dep., p. 64)  \nCongressman Schock testified that his new district is advantageous for a Republican. (Ex. C-\nSchock dep., pp. 44-45)  Furthermore, none of the Congressional plaintiffs testified to any \ndetailed information on the partisan composition of the newly adopted map.  Congressman \nShimkus testified he had no knowledge of the percentage of Republican versus Democratic \nvoters in the newly drawn Congressional map. (Ex. E - Shimkus dep., pp. 26-27)  Furthermore, \nwhen pressed for details about the analysis of the partisan make-up of the adopted map, the \nCongressional plaintiffs did not have any information (or were instructed by counsel not to \nanswer) regarding any partisan percentages. (See Ex. E - Shimkus dep., pp. 26-27, 35-37)  As \nsuch, the Congressional plaintiffs should be precluded from testifying regarding any details of \nthe partisan composition of the adopted map at the hearing of this matter. \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:2062\n \nII.  The citizen plaintiff fact witnesses should be barred from offering any \nopinion testimony as they lack the foundation and expertise  \n \nFor all of the reasons as to why the Congressional plaintiffs should be barred from \ntestifying, the citizen plaintiff fact witnesses should be barred from offering any opinion \ntestimony as well.  The citizen plaintiffs who have been identified as witnesses for trial are Ralph \nRangel, Lou Sandoval, Luis Sanabria, and Michelle Caballero.  These plaintiff fact witnesses \nhave as little knowledge about the issues raised in the amended complaint as do the \nCongressional plaintiffs.  None of the citizen witnesses took part in or have any knowledge about \nhow the adopted map was created. (Ex. I - Sanabria dep., pp. 12-15; Ex. J - Caballero dep., pp. \n19, 20, 21; Ex. K - Rangel dep., p. 41-46)  Although several of the citizen witnesses have their \nown personal opinions about the adopted Fourth Congressional District, they are simply non-\nexpert opinions.  None of the citizen witnesses reviewed, discussed or said that they relied upon \nany demographic data.   \nFor example, Mr. Sanabria’s testimony simply reiterates the allegations in plaintiffs’ \namended complaint that the adopted map, “packs Hispanic voters into District #4” and \ndiminishes Hispanic influence in Districts #3 and #5. (Ex. I - Sanabria dep., pp. 11-12, 23-24) \nThese conclusory opinions lack any foundation.  Mr. Sanabria has not reviewed or relied upon \nany data to make these statements.   \nSimilarly, Lou Sandoval’s testimony re-stated the allegations in the amended complaint, \nbut without foundation.  While Mr. Sandoval volunteered that his statements are supported by \ncensus data and a New York Times article, he neither offered specifics as to his opinions nor \ndetailed any educational and professional background in the areas of demography, political \nscience, statistics, quantitative methodologies, electoral analysis, or election law that would \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:2063\nmake him qualified to render those opinions. (Ex. L - Sandoval dep., p. 6-8; 75-82)  After \ndiscussing the map with plaintiffs’ lawyers, Ms. Caballero stated that she believes that the map \nunfairly segregates the 4th and 5th Districts into one Hispanic District. (Ex. J - Caballero dep., pp. \n25-28)  However, she likewise has no statistical or other expertise to render that opinion.  Lastly, \nwithout any analysis whatsoever, Mr. Rangel testified that he is not really aware of the adopted \nmap, but that it would create a potential of Spanish block other than District #4. (Ex. K - Rangel \ndep., pp. 30-31, 36-37) \nConclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, defendants respectfully request that the four \nCongressional plaintiffs be barred from testifying at the hearing of this matter in their entirety or, \nin the alternative, request that the Congressional plaintiffs be barred from testifying regarding the \nfollowing topics: \n  A.  Conclusions/opinions that they were “shut out” of the re-map process or \nthat it would not have made a difference if they participated in the process; \n \n  B.  The map drawers’ intent or factors that the drawers relied upon in drawing \nthe adopted map;   \n \n  C.  How or why the Congressional boundaries on the adopted map were \ndrawn; \n \n  D.  That the intention of the map drawers was to intentionally discriminate \nagainst Latinos; \n \n  E.  Any details or statistical data about the plaintiffs’ proffered map, also \nreferred to as the “Republican Map”; \n \n  F.  Any details or statistical data regarding the partisan breakdown of the \nadopted map; \n \n    G.  Any alleged out of court statements made by non-parties, including but not \nlimited to: \n \n      Illinois Senate President John Cullerton \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 111 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 11 of 11 PageID #:2064\n      Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan \n      Congressman Jerry Costello \n      Former Congressman William Lipinski \n      Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr.  \n \n  H.  Any draft maps exchanged between Congressman Shimkus and \nCongressman Costello. \n \n  Plaintiff further moves this court to bar any opinion testimony from the citizen plaintiff \nfact witnesses due to lack of foundation and relevance including, but not limited to, any \ntestimony that: \n  A.  the adopted map “packs” the Fourth Congressional District with Latinos \n  B.  that the Hispanic vote in the 3rd and 5th Districts are diminished. \n \n            Respectfully submitted,     \n           \n \n    /s/   Devon C.

Plaintiffs ask the Court to \ncompel Congressman Costello to produce documents responsive to the subpoena, and to provide \ntestimony regarding  the  Congressman’s  discussions  with  the  Democratic  Congressional \nCampaign  Committee  (“DCCC”)  and  other  current  and  former  Congressman  regarding  the \nIllinois redistricting process.  In support of this motion, Plaintiffs state:\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:851\nINTRODUCTION\n1. Plaintiffs served the Subpoena on Congressman Jerry Costello on September 22, \n2011.  Ex. A.  The Subpoena sought documents and testimonyrelated to Congressman Costello’s \ninvolvement in the Illinois redistricting process, as well as his conversations with other members \nof the Illinois congressional delegation about the redistricting process.  \n2.  In a letter dated October 11, 2011, counsel for Congressman Costello, Robert \nShannon, indicated two categories of objections to the subpoena.  Ex. B at 1.  First, counsel \nobjected that to the extent the subpoena related to information “exchanged among, or reflecting \ncommunications among, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) members \n(including Members of Congress and their aides), agents, consultants and/or attorneys relating to \nIllinois congressional redistricting,” the Congressman was adopting objections made by the \nDCCC in connection with a subpoena and motion to compel served on the DCCC by Plaintiffs. \nId.  The DCCC has objected to production of documents on the ground of First Amendment \nprivilege.  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is still pending in the District of the District of Columbia.  \nOn Friday, October 21, 2011, the court ordered the DCCC to produce certain categories of \ndocuments, but has yet to rule on the DCCC’s invocation of the First Amendment privilege.  \nEx.C.\n3. The second set of objections related to “material reflecting information exchanged \namong, or reflecting communications among, Congressman Costello and his aides regarding \nIllinois congressional redistricting.”  Ex. B at 1.  With respect to these materials, Congressman \nCostello again adopted the objections raised by the DCCC, and further objected on the ground \nthat the material was protected by the “legislative immunityand deliberative process privileges.”  \nId. \n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:852\n4.  Congressman Costello sat for his deposition on October 19, 2011.  Ex. D (“Dep.”) \nAt the deposition, Mr. Shannon, the Congressman’s counsel, reiterated the above objections.  \nDep. at 5-7.    Then, at least six times, Congressman Costello refused, on the advice of counsel, \nto answer questions regarding the substance of his conversations with other current Democratic \nmembers of the Illinois congressional delegation regarding the redistricting process in Illinois. \nSeeDep. at 29 (Lipinski), 30 (Schakowsky, Jackson, Rush), 31 (Rush, Guttierez, Davis).  \n6.  In  addition  to  Congressman  Costello’s  refusal  to  answer  Plaintiffs’  questions \nregarding  conversations  about  Illinois  redistricting  with  current  members  of  Congress, \nCongressman  Costello  took  inconsistent  position  regarding  his  conversations  with  former\nDemocratic Congressman William Lipinski,1  asserting privilege at one point, Dep. at 44-46, but \nlater discussing the substanceof a conversation. Dep. at 49.\n7. Also at the deposition, counsel for Congressman Costello acknowledged that the \nCongressman possessed documents responsive to the subpoena.  Dep. at 10.  Those documents \nwere similarly withheld from production pursuant to the same privilege invocation. See Ex. B at \n1.\n8.   None  of  Congressman  Costello’s  assertions of  privilege  was  justified.    The \nCongressman has no grounds for claiming the protection of the First Amendment, nor does any \nof the information sought by Plaintiffs come within the scope of any privilege or immunity he \nenjoys  as  a  member  of  Congress.    Accordingly,  Plaintiffs  request  that  the  Court  direct \nCongressman Costello to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena and to answer the \nquestions posed to him or provide testimonyon the subject matter raised byPlaintiffs’ counsel at \nhis depositionas to which he invoked privilege.\n   \n1 Congressman Costello could not confirm whether former Congressman Lipinski is a member of the DCCC.  \nThe DCCC website states that membership is composed of currentmembers of Congress.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:853\nARGUMENT\nA.  Congressman Costello Has No First Amendment Privilege To Assert Here.\nThe First Amendment privilege against compliance with discovery requests exists to \nprotect the “vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one’s associations.”  \nNAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462 (1958) (emphasis added).  Congressman Costello’s \nassertion of a First Amendment privilege fails for several reasons.  \nFirst, as Plaintiffs demonstrated in their Reply Brief in Support of their Motion to \nCompel against the DCCC, Ex. E, the information Plaintiffs seek is not the kind of information \nthe First Amendment protects.  Case after case makes clear that the root of the First Amendment \nprivilege against discovery is a concern with exposing information such as an organization’s \nmembership lists, the names of donors, the names of potential participants in an organization’s \nactivities and the like.  See, e.g., Int’l Action Center v. U.S., 207 F.R.D. 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2002) \n(information  about  participants  or  potential  participants  at  protest  is  “exactly  the  kind  of \ninformation the First Amendment is designed to protect”); Britt v. Superior Court, 20 Cal. 3d \n844, 852 (Cal. 1978) (“In compelling the wholesale disclosure of private association affiliations \nand activities, the challenged discovery order works an unconstitutional infringement of First \nAmendment rights.”); Wilkinson v. F.B.I, 111 F.R.D. 432, 436 (C.D. Cal. 1986) (“A review of \nthe cases applying the privilege reveals that in each case the discovery that was subject to \nenhanced First Amendment scrutiny was a specific request for a group’s membership list or list \nof financial contributors.”).  \nPlaintiffs have not sought and do not want any information related to membership or \nsupport of the DCCC or any other group to which Congressman Costello might belong.  Nor, \nhave Plaintiffs sought information regarding the internal strategies of the DCCC related to \nupcoming congressional elections in Illinois or elsewhere.  See Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 591\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:854\nF.3d  1147,  1162  (9th  Cir.  2010)  (internal  strategy documents  may be  protected).      What  \nPlaintiffs have asked for is a narrow category of information and testimony related only to \nCongressman Costello’s involvement in the redistricting process in Illinois.  That process was \nnot part of the internal workings of the DCCC.  The Congressman, the DCCC, and other \nmembers of the Illinois Democratic congressional delegation all chose to inject themselves into \nthat process, and cannot now claim privilege over communications relating to their involvement \nin that process. See, e.g., Ex. F (Dkt. 77, Opinion and Order holding that legislative privilege did \nnot apply to Illinois legislators’ conversations with the DCCC).  It is simply not credible for \nCongressman Costello(or anyone else) to now argue that he has a privacyinterest to protect with \nregard to his particular involvement.  There can be no expectation of privacy when one injects \nhimself into such aprocess.\nSecond, Congressman Costello’s interest in redistricting is wholly related to his status as \nan  officeholder  under  the  very map  at  issue.  For  this  very reason,  any claim  that  his \ncommunications about such a map—with anyone—impinge upon his right to associate privately\nis nonsense.  The First Amendment exists because “public identification of individuals who \nnever intended their participation in First Amendment activity to thrust them into the harsh glare \nof the limelight” can work to “chill future political dissent and discourage participation in other \nprotest activity.”  Int’l Action Center, 207 F.R.D. at 3-4.  But as a public official whose political \nassociations are long established and well known, the Congressman cannot credibly claim that \ndisclosure of his conversations with other office holders, whose associations are also well-\nknown, will result in any chilling effect at all.  Indeed, many of the conversations about which \nPlaintiffs seek testimony occurred on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.  \nSee Dep. at 28.   It is simply absurd to suggest that Congressman Costello or his fellow members \n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:855\nof Congress need or are entitled to the First Amendment’s protection from the limelight.  This is \nparticularly true where, as is the case here, the communications were about a public legislative \nprocess.  \nThird, Congressman Costello has already waived any particular privileges that might \nhave attached by discussing the involvement of himself and other DCCC members, employees, \nand  agents  in  the  Illinois  Congressional  redistricting  process  with  several  different  people, \nincluding Plaintiffs in this very lawsuit.  Although Congressman Costello has asserted privilege \nover, for example, document  “reflecting  communications  among, Democratic Congressional \nCampaign Committee (DCCC) members (including Members of Congress and their aides),” Ex. \nB at 1, he nonetheless discussed his conversations with the DCCC, Senator Dick Durbin, and \nCongresswoman Jan Schakowsky about the DCCC’s involvement in the redistricting process\nwith Republican Congressman John Shimkus.  Ex. G (Deposition of John Shimkus), at 53.  And, \nas noted above, while Congressman Costello asserted privilege as to conversations with other \nDemocratic  members of  the  Illinois  delegation (i.e.  members  of  the  DCCC),  he  also  told \nCongressman Shimkus that, based on those conversations, Costello believed that a bipartisan \nredistricting compromise might be possible.  Dep. at 33.  Furthermore, Congressman Costello \ndiscussed  the  same  matters,  based  on  the  same  conversations,  with  legislative  leaders  in \nSpringfield, such as Senate President John Cullerton and House Speaker Mike Madigan.2  After \ndisclosing his supposedly privileged conversations with so many different people, Congressman \nCostello cannot now seriously claim that his associational privacy will be adversely affected by \ngiving testimony about the same matters that he has already discussed so openly with people \n   \n2 This Court already has ruled that such conversations as well as any others between the Illinois General \nAssembly or its members or staff and third parties, including representatives of the DCCC, are not protected by any \nprivilege held by member of the Illinois General Assembly, and are thus discoverable in this litigation. Ex. F(Dkt. \n77).\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 7 of 8 PageID #:856\noutside the DCCC. \nB.  Congressman Costello Can Assert No Claim Of Legislative Immunity Or\nDeliberative Process Privilege\nCongressman Costello’s assertions of legislative immunity and/or deliberative process \nprivilege are likewise without merit.  Congressman Costello is a member of the United States \nHouse  of  Representatives.    But  the  drawing  of the  Illinois  Congressional  Map  is  the \nresponsibility of  the  Illinois  General  Assembly,  not  the  U.S.  House.    In  other  words,  the \nCongressman had no official involvement in the remapping process whatsoever.  He therefore \ncannot invoke privileges that exist to protect members of Congress in the conduct of their official \nduties.  See Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 625 (1972) (protection of the Speech and \nDebate  Clause  only  reaches  matters  that  are  an  “integral  part  of  the  deliberative  and \ncommunicative processes by which Members participate in committee and House proceedings \nwith respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect \nto other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House”).  Because \nnone of the information sought in this case relates to the official duties or responsibilities of \nCongressman Costello’s office, neither the federal legislative immunity nor the deliberative \nprocess privilegehas any application here. \nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE,  for  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  should  order  Respondent \nCongressman Costello to produce documents responsive to the subpoena and provide testimony \nregarding his conversations with the DCCC and other current and former members of Congress \nrelated to the Illinois redistricting process.\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 8 of 8 PageID #:857\n RespectfullySubmitted,\nDated: October 24, 2011 By: /s/Lori E.

In  support  of  these  objections,  Respondent \nspecifically  adopts  those  objections  and  arguments  made  by  the  DCCC  in  both  its \ncorrespondence to you of August 26, 2011 and in its response to plaintiff’s motion to compel the \nDCCC. \nRespondent also objects to any documents or material reflecting information exchanged \namong, or reflecting communications among, Congressman Costello and his aides regarding \nIllinois congressional redistricting.  In support of said objection, Respondent again adopts those \nobjections raised by the DCCC and states that such information is protected by the legislative \nimmunity and deliberative process privileges. \n  Subject to and without waiver, we discussed that I have documents that fall into the \nabove categories, but at this time you do not require a privilege log.  We understand that you \nmay choose to insist upon a log at a later date.  \n \n  Please feel free to call me with any questions. \n \n \nArizona    California    Florida    Illinois    Indiana    Massachusetts    Minnesota    Missouri    New York    Oregon    Rhode Island    Wisconsin \n130185217v1  7048395  ADMINISTRA \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 17 of 148 PageID #:874\nOctober 11, 2011 \nPage 2 \n \n \nRegards, \nHINSHAW & CULBERTSON LLP \n \n/s/ Robert T.

LIGHTFOOT:  Lori Lightfoot representing\n3   the plaintiffs in this action.\n4                  (WHEREUPON, the witness was duly\n5                   sworn.)\nPage 3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 25 of 148 PageID #:882\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n6        Q.    Good morning, Congressman.\n7        A.    Good morning.\n8        Q.    As I had mentioned before we went on the\n9   record, we will try to get you in and out of here\n10   as quickly as possible.  Your counsel and I have\n11   had several conversations leading up to today's\n12   deposition.  I think he wants to put a point on the\n13   record and then I will respond and then we can\n14   actually get to the substance of the deposition\n15   itself.\n16              So go ahead, Mr. Shannon.\n17        MR. SHANNON:  Certainly.  Thank you.\n18              As a follow-up to our communications and\n19   in connection with the subpoena and the\n20   accompanying rider issued to Congressman Costello,\n21   we have objected to any materials and\n22   communications that would reflect conversations\n23   with -- between the Congressman and other fellow\n24   members of Federal Congress, any DCCC\n25   representatives or agents, including attorneys or\n(cid:129)\n5\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   consultants, which would include the NCEC in\n3   connection with the Illinois congressional\n4   redistricting for the reasons reflected in the -- I\n5   guess the most efficient way to handle it is for\n6   the reasons reflected in the DCCC response to\n7   plaintiff's motion to compel filed I believe in an\n8   ancillary proceeding which I understand to still be\nPage 4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 26 of 148 PageID #:883\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n9   pending.\n10              We also, as reflected in prior\n11   communication, will be objecting and instructing\n12   the Congressman not to offer any testimony relative\n13   to any material or communications that he may have\n14   had with his own congressional aides, again for the\n15   reasons reflected in the DCCC response to the\n16   pending motion to compel and the ancillary\n17   proceeding as well as deliberative process and\n18   legislative immunity and legislative privileges.\n19        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  All right.  Just one point of\n20   clarification, counsel.\n21        MR. SHANNON:  Certainly.\n22        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  I wanted to make sure that you\n23   didn't intend to go as broadly as you did.\n24              You said that one of the objections that\n25   you have is to any communications that the\n(cid:129)\n6\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   Congressman might have with any other member of\n3   Congress.\n4              Did you mean to say it that broadly?\n5        MR. SHANNON:  I meant only Democratic members\n6   of Congress.\n7        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  Fair enough.  You are aware\n8   obviously that we have indicated to you that we,\n9   one, don't believe that there is any privilege that\n10   the Congressman may assert on the basis of the\n11   topics that are going to be covered here today.  We\nPage 5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 27 of 148 PageID #:884\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n12   are not going to be asking him specific questions\n13   that impinge about his duties and responsibilities\n14   as a federal member of Congress as opposed to his\n15   involvement in the Illinois redistricting.\n16              So on that basis we don't think he has\n17   got any privilege.  We don't believe and as we have\n18   reflected in our court papers with the DCCC that\n19   any privilege attaches to them and, frankly, that\n20   we are struggling to see the nexus between whatever\n21   First Amendment issue, which is what they have\n22   asserted, might be relevant to them, how that would\n23   apply to the congressman.\n24              And then finally, as you know, we\n25   believe that to the extent that there was any\n(cid:129)\n7\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   privilege between the DCCC and the Congressman, he\n3   has waived that by virtue of the fact that he has\n4   disclosed certain communications DCCC to third\n5   parties that are clearly outside the scope of the\n6   ambit of the DCCC.\n7              What we have agreed is that I believe --\n8   and correct me if I'm wrong -- I'm going to ask\n9   certain questions.  To the extent that you are\n10   going to object or instruct him not to answer,\n11   we'll proceed by that and then we'll let the court\n12   determine at some later time.\n13              It's certainly not my intent to have to\n14   bring the Congressman back but obviously I've got\nPage 6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 28 of 148 PageID #:885\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n18   we agree to disagreed --\n19        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  That's right.\n20        MR. SHANNON:  -- that you are reserving your\n21   right to this material, we are reserving our right\n22   to object, you are reserving the right to,\n23   depending on how things play out, re-request the\n24   Congressman's deposition and we are reserving our\n25   right to consider that and reserving our right to\n(cid:129)\n9\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   object.\n3              And as it relates to the documents, yes,\n4   we do have the documents.  The only caveat I would\n5   say is that while you indicated that they are\n6   responsive, I think what I would state for the\n7   record is that subject perhaps to any relevancy\n8   arguments that I don't want to waive, we do have\n9   documents that are potentially responsive that we\n10   have asserted the privilege objections on.\n11        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  Fair enough.\n12   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n13        Q.    Congressman, with the indulgence of your\n14   counsel, I'm going to try to quickly move through\n15   your background so that we can get on to more\n16   substantive matters.\n17              I took the liberty of pulling off your\n18   bio from the National Journal's Almanac of American\n19   Politics.  And let me just see if they've got it\n20   right.\nPage 8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 29 of 148 PageID #:886\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n21              It looks like you began your political\n22   career in -- let's see.  Looks like 1980.  Is that\n23   correct?  As the chairman of the St. Clair County\n24   Board of Supervisors.\n25        A.    That's correct.  In December 1980.\n(cid:129)\n10\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2        Q.    And you held that position from 1980\n3   through 1988; is that correct?\n4        A.    Correct.\n5        Q.    And then was that the point that you\n6   then became a member of Congress?\n7        A.    It was.\n8        Q.    And you represent roughly the kind of\n9   Belleville, deep south area of the State of\n10   Illinois; is that correct?\n11        A.    Southwestern and southern Illinois.\n12        Q.    Okay.  Is that essentially the area that\n13   you have represented for -- since the time you have\n14   been in Congress?\n15        A.    Essentially, yes.\n16        Q.    Again, tell me -- remind me what year\n17   you actually started in Congress.\n18        A.    August the 11th of 1988.\n19        Q.    Were you appointed to fill the unexpired\n20   term of Congressman Price?\n21        A.    I was not.  We had a special election.\n22   I was elected.\n23        Q.    Okay.  Fair enough.  Let me then turn to\nPage 9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 30 of 148 PageID #:887\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n9        A.    That's correct.\n10        Q.    You have a second conversation with him\n11   that you described that's roughly 30 days later,\n12   correct?\n13        A.    A maximum of 30 days.\n14        Q.    Okay.\n15        A.    It may have been within a matter of a\n16   week, but it was no longer than 30 days.\n17        Q.    This contact that you had with members\n18   of the Democratic delegation, did that occur in\n19   between those two Shimkus conversations or did it\n20   occur afterwards or some mix?\n21        A.    I don't remember.  I really don't.\n22        Q.    Okay.  Fair enough.  I'm going to take\n23   these one by one.  And I assume that your counsel\n24   will object, but I'm going to ask you anyway.\n25              What was your conversation with --\n(cid:129)\n27\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   again, I think you described it, but these were\n3   conversations that took place roughly on the House\n4   floor as you were seeing members, is that correct,\n5   or did they take place other places?\n6        MR. BRUCE:  Object to the form.\n7        MR. SHANNON:  You can describe the location.\n8        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  I mean, I can go one by one.\n9   BY THE WITNESS:\n10        A.    Sure.  They took place on the House\n11   floor and also in a meeting with all -- I don't\nPage 24\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 31 of 148 PageID #:888\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n12   know if all eight democrats were there but the\n13   majority of them were there in the meeting.\n14   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n15        Q.    And we'll get to the meeting in a\n16   moment.\n17        A.    Sure.\n18        Q.    Let's stick right now to the\n19   conversations that you had on the House floor and\n20   if you -- I'm going to ask you about each of the\n21   members that you identified.  If the conversation\n22   did not take place on the House floor, I want you\n23   to just tell me that.\n24              Congressman Lipinski, was that a\n25   conversation on the House floor?\n(cid:129)\n28\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2        MR. BRUCE:  Lori, I'll just get a standing\n3   objection if you agree to it as to all of these\n4   conversations with Democratic congressmen on\n5   relevancy.\n6        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  Sure.  I agree to you\n7   interposing the standing objection, yes.\n8        MR. SHANNON:  I think the question was did it\n9   occur on the House floor with Congressman Lipinski.\n10        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  That's right.\n11   BY THE WITNESS:\n12        A.    There were multiple conversations and\n13   all of them occurred on the House floor and there\n14   was a meeting as well.\nPage 25\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 32 of 148 PageID #:889\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n15   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n16        Q.    I'll ask about you about the meeting\n17   separately.  But with respect to Congressman\n18   Lipinski, what did you say and what did he say to\n19   you?\n20        MR. SHANNON:  I will advise you not to testify\n21   or offer testimony reflecting conversations with a\n22   fellow member of Congress.  And if you agree, you\n23   can simply reflect \"on advice of counsel I refuse\n24   to answer.\"\n25        MS. LIGHTFOOT:  And again, I assume that your\n(cid:129)\n29\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   instruction pertains to a Democratic member of\n3   Congress only.\n4        MR.

Congressman Schakowsky, what did you say\n10   to her and what did she say to you?\n11        MR. SHANNON:  Same instruction.\n12   BY THE WITNESS:\n13        A.    I agree.  Or I --\n14        MR.

Congressman Jackson, what did he\n19   say to you and what did you say to him?\n20        MR. SHANNON:  Same instruction.\n21   BY THE WITNESS:\n22        A.

Just so the record is clear, for all\n4   these folks, I'm going to ask you what did you say\n5   to him or her and what they say to you.\n6              So Congressman Rush, what did you say to\n7   him and what did he say to you?\n8        MR. SHANNON:  Same instruction.\n9   BY THE WITNESS:\n10        A.    And I will abide by my counsel's advice.\n11   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n12        Q.    Congressman Gutierrez, what did you say\n13   to him and what did he say to?\n14        MR. SHANNON:  Same instruction.\n15   BY THE WITNESS:\n16        A.    I will abide by my counsel's advice.\n17   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n18        Q.    And Congressman Davis, what did you say\n19   to him and what did he say to you?\n20        MR.

I will abide by my counsel's advice.\n23   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n24        Q.    Did there come a point in time where you\n25   reported back to Congressman Shimkus what you had\n(cid:129)\n31\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   learned from your Democratic colleagues as to\n3   whether or not there was any interest in a\n4   bipartisan solution to the congressional\n5   redistricting issue?\n6        MR. SHANNON:  Objection to form.\n7              You can answer subject to my prior\n8   instructions.\n9   BY THE WITNESS:\n10        A.    I did.\n11   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n12        Q.    And was that before or after the meeting\n13   that you indicated took place among the -- some of\n14   members of Democratic delegation?\n15        A.    I don't recall if it was before or\n16   after.\n17        Q.    And where did that subsequent\n18   consideration with Congressman Shimkus take place?\n19        A.    I think it took place on the floor of\n20   the House.\n21        Q.    Was anybody else a part of that\n22   conversation aside from you and Congressman\n23   Shimkus?\nPage 28\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 90-1 Filed: 10/24/11 Page 35 of 148 PageID #:892\n1019COSTELLO.txt\n24        A.    Not that I recall.\n25        Q.    What did you say to him and what did he\n(cid:129)\n32\n1               ROUGH DRAFT-UNCERTIFIED COPY\n2   say to you?\n3        A.    I told him that there was an interest on\n4   the part of the Democratic members in attempting to\n5   reach a bipartisan agreement.\n6        Q.    And what, if anything, did he say to\n7   you?\n8        A.    He indicated to me again that he hoped\n9   that we could try and reach an agreement.\n10        Q.    Did the two of you in that conversation\n11   discuss anything in terms of next steps to move the\n12   conversation along from conversation to something\n13   that might bear fruit?\n14        MR. SHANNON:  Objection to the form.\n15              You can answer.\n16        MR. BRUCE:  Join.\n17   BY THE WITNESS:\n18        A.    We did.\n19   BY MS. LIGHTFOOT:\n20        Q.    Okay.  And what did you discuss?\n21        A.    We discussed his -- what his members,\n22   the Republican members of the delegation, what they\n23   thought would be a fair map and what they wanted to\n24   do next, the steps that they wanted to take.\n25        Q.

Did you communicate that interest to the\n4   people that were gathered there?\n5        A.    I did.\n6        Q.    By the way, do you know why it was that\n7   Congressman Bill Lipinski was present for that\n8   meeting?\n9        MR. BRUCE:  Objection; foundation, relevancy.\n10        MR.

LIGHTFOOT:  You are asserting a privilege\n7   as to a conversation that he had with former\n8   Congressman Bill Lipinski.\n9        MR. SHANNON:  Right.  Well, there's two\n10   things.  The answer is yes under the same arguments\n11   reflected in the DCCC filing.\n12              But I believe if you look back at the\n13   record he was about to discuss communications that\n14   may have occurred ten years ago.\n15        MS.

As a part of discovery, Plaintiffs subpoenaed\nthe DCCC and requested a limited set of documents related to the DCCC’s involvement in the\nIllinois redistricting process. Ever since it was served with Plaintiffs’ subpoena (“Subpoena”),\nhowever, the DCCC has utterly rejected its obligations pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Both its blanket objections and bad faith approach to the meet and confer process\ndemonstrate the DCCC’s total disregard for the duly issued Subpoena. Likewise, the DCCC’s\nSeptember 22, 2011 Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel (“Opposition”) relies upon\nblatant mischaracterizations of Plaintiffs’ undeniably narrow document requests, the DCCC’s\nown organization and membership, and inapposite case law in an effort to thwart standard\ndiscovery of relevant documents that are central to Plaintiffs’ claims now pending in the\nNorthernDistrictofIllinois.\nThe DCCC’s assertion that it has no obligation to comply with the Subpoena in light of\nthe pending motion to dismiss is meritless given that, by the directive of the presiding judge in\nthe underlying matter, the parties to the underlying action are proceeding with their fact and\nexpert discovery. In fact, Judge Lefkow’s August 11, 2011 order (“Order”) setting a briefing\nscheduleand grantingexpedited discoveryspecificallyaccounted forthe fact thattheDefendants\nmight file a motion to dismiss (Order ¶ 1). Nevertheless, the Order requires that discovery\ncontinue, setting expert discovery deadlines of September 14 and September 28 (id. ¶ 2.3), and\nmandating that “[d]iscovery shall be completed by October 19, 2011.” Id. ¶ 2.8. The DCCC’s\n1\n\nCase: C1a:1s1e- c1v:1-015-m06c5-0 D0o5c1u4m-DeAnRt #  :  D9o0c-1u mFielendt :1 130  / 2 F4i/l1e1d  P0a9g/2e9 4/141 o  f  P1a4g8e P 3a goef I2D4 #:901\nsuggestionthatthis CourtsimplyignoretheOrder issuedbyafellowUnitedStates DistrictCourt\nis untenable.\nDespite the DCCC’s hyperbole, nothing about Plaintiffs’ Subpoena can be construed as\n“a declaration of war.” Opp. at 3. Rather, Plaintiffs’ Subpoena is a targeted inquiry focused\nsolely upon the role that the DCCC played in the creation and development of the 2011 Illinois\ncongressional redistricting plan (“Plan”) enacted as Illinois P.A. 97-14. On its face, the\nSubpoena does not, as the DCCC falsely claims, seek the “DCCC’s most sensitive information”\nsuch as “its analysis of the 2012 Congressional elections in Illinois and redistricting’s impact on\nthose elections; documents relating to its efforts to recruit Domocratic (sic) candidates to\nchallenge Plaintiffs; and the tools and methods its uses to target the electorate and analyze voter\nbehavior. . . .” (Opp. at 1). Plaintiffs’ counsel repeatedly has stated quite clearly that the\nPlaintiffs have no interest in such information. Rather, the documents Plaintiffs request are very\nspecific categories of information concerning the role that the DCCC and its agents played in\ndrafting portions of the constitutionally infirm 2011 Illinois congressional redistricting Plan that\nis the subjectofthe underlyingaction. TheDCCC does notand cannot assertthatitdid not have\na key role in this process. Indeed, on September 29, 2011, United States Congressman Peter\nRoskam testified that Illinois Senate President John J. Cullerton, a Democrat, informed him that\nthe DCCC drew the map. It is precisely because the DCCC inserted itself into this state\nlegislative process that historically has been the sole province of state legislators that the DCCC\ncannotnowhidebehind purported FirstAmendmentinterests, privilege, or confidentialityclaims\nto shield that information from discovery. First Amendment concerns simply are not at issue\nhere.\n2\n\nCase: C1a:1s1e- c1v:1-015-m06c5-0 D0o5c1u4m-DeAnRt #  :  D9o0c-1u mFielendt :1 130  / 2 F4i/l1e1d  P0a9g/2e9 4/151 o  f  P1a4g8e P 4a goef I2D4 #:902\nARGUMENT\nI. There Is Nothing “Premature” About Plaintiffs’ Discovery Requests Or Motion To\nCompelComplianceTherewith.\nAs explained in Plaintiffs’ September 8, 2011 Motion To Compel Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee To Comply With Subpoena Seeking Third Party Discovery\n(“Motion to Compel”), “Rule 45 subpoenas are ‘discovery’ under Rules 16 and 26 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, and are subject to the same deadlines as other forms of discovery.”\nDag Enters., Inc. v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 226 F.R.D. 95, 104 (D.D.C. 2005). Moreover, “[a]\nscheduling order is not a frivolous piece of paper, idly entered, which can be cavalierly\ndisregarded bycounselwithoutperil. Indeed,disregardoftheorderwould underminethecourt’s\nabilityto control its docket, disrupt the agreed-upon course of litigation, and reward the indolent\nandthecavalier.” Id. (internalcitationsandbracketsomitted).\nAccording to the Order entered by Judge Lefkow in the underlying action as well as her\nstanding order (Mot. Ex. K), discovery proceeds unabated even during the pendency of the\nbriefing of the motion to dismiss. Specifically, the Order sets expert discovery deadlines of\nSeptember 14 and September 28 (Order ¶ 2.3), and mandates that “[d]iscovery shall be\ncompleted by October 19, 2011.” Id. ¶ 2.8. As set forth in the Motion to Compel, expedited\ndiscovery is necessary because of the looming deadlines related to the 2012 election season, for\nwhich the Plan was created. Mot. ¶ 5. Thus, the DCCC has absolutely no right to defy that\nOrderandignoretheSubpoena,a courtorder,simplybecausethemotiontodismissispending.\nThe DCCC cannot unilaterally decide what schedule suits it, particularly in the face of a\nvalid Subpoena and an established expedited briefingand discoveryschedule agreed upon bythe\nparties and ordered by a United States District Judge. In addition, it is not up to the DCCC to\ndecide whether discovery should be stayed pending a decision on the motion to dismiss the\n3\n\nCase: C1a:1s1e- c1v:1-015-m06c5-0 D0o5c1u4m-DeAnRt #  :  D9o0c-1u mFielendt :1 130  / 2 F4i/l1e1d  P0a9g/2e9 4/161 o  f  P1a4g8e P 5a goef I2D4 #:903\nunderlying action. That determination is solely for the court to make, and the DCCC has made\nno motion requesting such relief. See Beecham v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\n245 F.R.D. 1, 3 (D.D.C.2007) (internal citations omitted) (denying stay of jurisdictional\ndiscovery). Nor does the filingof a dispositive motion presumptivelyentitle the DCCC to a stay\nofdiscoveryevenifithadaskedforit. OMGFidelity,Inc.v.SiriusTechs.,Inc.,239 F.R.D.300,\n304 (N.D.N.Y. 2006) (mere filing of a motion to dismiss does not guarantee entitlement to a\nstay). The DCCC therefore cannot refuse to comply with the Subpoena in light of the pending\nmotiontodismisstheunderlyingaction.\nThe weakness of its argument is demonstrated clearly by the cases cited in support of it\nby the DCCC. In an attempt to justify its position, the DCCC cites several cases in which\ndiscovery was stayed while dispositive motions were pending. None of the cases relied upon by\nthe DCCC are persuasive or applicable, however, because none involve instances in which a\ncourt has ordered expedited discovery. See, e.g., Chavous v. District of Columbia Financial\nResponsibility &Mgmt. AssistanceAuthority,201 F.R.D.1,2(D.D.C.2001). In fact,in granting\nthe moving party’s motion to stay discovery, the court in Cleveland Construction, Inc. v.\nSchenkel & Schultz Architects, P.A., No. 08-CV-407-RJC-DCK, 2009 WL 903564 (W.D.N.C.\nMar. 31, 2009), observed that the “discovery deadline is still seven months away”. Id. at *2.\nThis tactic from the DCCC can only be interpreted as attempt to delay because, as the\nundersigned counsel has explained to counsel for the DCCC and as is obvious from the face of\nthe scheduling order, the district court ordered discovery to continue uninterrupted even during\nthe pendency of the motion to dismiss briefing. In the face of the Northern District of Illinois\ncourt’s current scheduling order which anticipates on-going discovery during the briefing of a\nmotion to dismiss, there is simply no basis for the DCCC to seek this Court’s assistance in\n4\n\nCase: C1a:1s1e- c1v:1-015-m06c5-0 D0o5c1u4m-DeAnRt #  :  D9o0c-1u mFielendt :1 130  / 2 F4i/l1e1d  P0a9g/2e9 4/171 o  f  P1a4g8e P 6a goef I2D4 #:904\nignoring this valid court order. In addition, as the DCCC well knows, Plaintiffs do not have the\nluxuryof continueddelay,astheirdiscoverydeadlineis lessthanonemonthaway.\nPlaintiffs respectfully submit that this Court should refuse the DCCC’s request to\ninterfere with the Order’s expedited discovery schedule because it is well-settled that “[c]omity\ninterests are advanced when courts of coordinate ranks are respectful of each other’s orders, as\nwell as careful to avoid hindering each other’s proceedings.” NAACP, Jefferson County Branch\nv. Brock, 619 F. Supp. 846, 853 (D.D.C. 1985) (citing Schauss v. Metals Depository Corp., 757\nF.2d 649, 654 (5th Cir. 1985)) and declining to issue a show cause order which would have\ndelayed proceedings in another district court.). See also Doe v. Doe Agency, 608 F. Supp. 2d 68\n(D.D.C. 2009) (declining on ground of comity to modify protective order issued in another\njurisdiction). The need to adhere to the expedited discovery schedule is particularly strong in\nthis case in order to facilitate a prompt resolution to the underlying action in advance of\nupcomingdeadlinesrelatingtothe2012primaryelectionprocess.\nII. Plaintiffs Have Requested—And The DCCC Possesses—Documents Highly\nRelevantToPlaintiffs’Claims.\n“The party resisting discovery based on relevance bears the burden of demonstrating that\nthe information sought is not legally relevant.” Peskoff v. Faber, 2006 WL 1933483, *2 (D.D.C.\nJuly11, 2006). The DCCC cannot meetthatburden here. “[R]elevancyat thediscoverystage is\nbroadly defined,” Albany Molecular Research, Inc. v. Schloemer, 274 F.R.D. 22, 27 (D.D.C.\n2011) (denying motion to quash), and Plaintiffs amply have demonstrated that the material\nsoughtisdiscoverable.\nBecause the DCCC and/or its agents were instrumental in the creation of the Plan, the\nDCCC’s documents regarding the process of making that map evidence what the mapmakers\nwere trying to accomplish, i.e. their intent. Despite the DCCC’s protests to the contrary, the\n5\n\nCase: C1a:1s1e- c1v:1-015-m06c5-0 D0o5c1u4m-DeAnRt #  :  D9o0c-1u mFielendt :1 130  / 2 F4i/l1e1d  P0a9g/2e9 4/181 o  f  P1a4g8e P 7a goef I2D4 #:905\nDCCC is not a mere disinterested “third party” (e.g. Opp. at 9) where the Plan is concerned. On\ninformation and belief and as two United States Congressmen have testified1, the DCCC and/or\nits agents directed the Illinois redistricting and map drawing process. Tellingly, the DCCC has\nnever denied its role in drafting portions of the Plan and its response in opposition contains no\nstatement or evidence to refute its central role in the drafting of the Plan.2 The DCCC cannot\nnow argue in good faith that its involvement in drafting portions of the Plan that is now the\nsubject of litigation is somehow irrelevant to showing what Illinois lawmakers were trying to\naccomplish.\nThe DCCC blithely suggests that evidence of intent will come from Illinois legislators\nthemselves. Opp. at 9. But “[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a\nmotivating factor [in the passage of legislation] demands a sensitive inquiry into such\ncircumstantialand direct evidenceof intentas maybeavailable.” Village of ArlingtonHeights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (U.S. 1977). Whether Illinois\nlegislators may have other discoverable evidence of intent is beside the point.3 The DCCC\nplainly has documents that form part of this “sensitive inquiry” because of their role in the\n1 Reps. John Shimkus and Peter Roskam were deposed in the underlying action on\nSeptember 29, 2011. The transcripts of their depositions are not yet available but will be\nprovidedifhelpfulfortheCourt.\n2 Although the facts are still evolving, there is a possibility, though not at issue here, that\nthe DCCC, which is not a registered lobbyist in Illinois, may have violated the Illinois Lobbyist\nRegistration Act, 25 ILCS 170, in influencing and directing the Illinois legislative process by\nwhichthePlan was passed.\n3 In whatcannotbeacoincidence,thosesameSpringfield DemocratsfromwhomPlaintiffs\nalso seek discovery have objected on the specious grounds of absolute immunity and pointed to\nthe DCCC as the better source of information. See Mem. Supp. Mot. to Quash at 11-12; Opp. to\nMot. to Compel at 14 (attached hereto as Exhibits A (attachments omitted) and B, respectively).\nThe image of the DCCC and its partners, the Springfield Democratic lawmakers, pointing to\neach other as the sources of information about the map would be comical if the issues at stake—\nspecifically whether the Plan which was the product of that alliance violates the Voting Rights\nAct by, among other things, intentionally discriminating against Latino voters in Illinois—were\nnotsoserious.\n6\n\nCase: C1a:1s1e- c1v:1-015-m06c5-0 D0o5c1u4m-DeAnRt #  :  D9o0c-1u mFielendt :1 130  / 2 F4i/l1e1d  P0a9g/2e9 4/191 o  f  P1a4g8e P 8a goef I2D4 #:906\ncreation of the Plan. Indeed, the DCCC has admitted as much. Opp. at 5. Plaintiffs must be\nallowedtodiscoverthesematerials.\nFurther, the DCCC’s argument that evidence of discriminatory effect will come from\nexperts is a canard. Rule 26(b)(1) permits discovery “regarding any nonprivileged matter that is\nrelevant to any party’s claim or defense.” FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(1). See also Heat & Control,\nInc. v. Hester Indus., Inc., 785 F.2d 1017, 1023 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (noting that Rule 45 must be\nread in light of Rule 26(b)). For that matter, regardless of the DCCC’s efforts to evaluate\nPlaintiffs’ claims and strategies in the underlying action, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nimpose no requirement that the material sought be relevant to every element of a claim.\nFurthermore, while discriminatory effect is a factor in Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander claim\nunder Davis v. Bandemer, 479 U.S. 109 (1986), it is discriminatory intent that is an integral\nelement of each of Plaintiffs’ claims. See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 766\n(9th Cir. 1990) (the Voting Rights Act can be violated by either intentional discrimination or\ndiscriminatory effect); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995) (plaintiff's burden in a racial\ngerrymander claim under the Equal Protection Clause is to show that “that race was the\npredominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters\nwithin or without a particular district”); Davis, 478 U.S. at 127 (plurality) (to succeed on an\nequal protection claim, a plaintiff must plead and ultimately prove intentional discrimination\nagainst an identifiable group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group). The documents\nsought by Plaintiffs’ Subpoena are highly relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims related to discriminatory\nintent in the creation of the Plan, and that is sufficient to make the information on the DCCC’s\nroleindraftingthePlan discoverable.\n7\n\nCase: C1a:1s1e- c1v:1-015-m06c5-0 D0o5c1u4m-DeAnRt #  :  D9o0c-1u mFielendt :1 130  / 2 F4i/l1e1d  P0a9g/2e9 5/101 o  f  P1a4g8e P 9a goef I2D4 #:907\nNor can the DCCC continue to object to the Subpoena on the ground that it imposes an\nundue burden. See Opp. at 7-8. Aside from having waived that objection by not giving a\ndetailed statement of the time and expense involved, see Flatow v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,\n196 F.R.D. 203, 207 (D.D.C. 2000), now the DCCC admits that is already has collected nearly\n800 pages of responsive documents. Opp. at 5. In that circumstance, there is “no reason to\nbelieve that producing them would engender an undue burden or expense.” Marriott Intern.\nResorts, L.P. v. United States, 61 Fed. Cl. 411, 420 (2004) (requiring government to produce\ndocumentsitalreadycollectedandidentified).\nIII. The First Amendment Does Not Preclude Production Of Documents Pursuant To\nTheSubpoena.\nFirst Amendment interests are not implicated by Plaintiffs’ Subpoena. The Subpoena\nrequests a limited range of documents related to the DCCC’s involvement in the process (which\nis now long over) that resulted in the Illinois congressional district map that was signed into law\nin late June. It does not seek information about private citizens who affiliate with the DCCC,\nmembership lists, or donor lists—the types of materials that typically raise First Amendment\nconcerns. Nor does it seek to pry into the DCCC’s campaign strategies for the upcoming\nelections. The Illinois redistricting process is long over, and it is untenable to maintain that\ndocuments related to that process have anything to do with the strategy for the upcoming 2012\nelections. Moreover, the DCCC’s members, all members of Congress, are well-known public\nofficeholders,4 distinguishing the DCCC from other groups who have availed themselves of the\nFirstAmendment’s protectionofprivateassociationalactivity.\n4 Asdiscussedfurtherbelow,theDCCC callsitself“theofficialcampaignarmofthe\nDemocratsintheHouse[ofRepresentatives].” http://www.dccc.org/pages/about.\n8\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /5111  o  fP 1a4g8e  P1a0g oefI D24 #:908\nThe Subpoena requests documents that evidence the DCCC’s involvement in the Illinois\nstate legislative process related to redistricting. This legislative process is one that by its very\nnature should be public. It also is a process into which the DCCC affirmatively chose to insert\nits public organization and well known members. Having done this, the DCCC cannot hide\nbehind the First Amendment, and the law (including the cases relied on by the DCCC) does not\nallowthemtodoso. TheDCCC’sclaimof FirstAmendmentprotections mustfail.\nA. The Subpoena Does Not Seek Documents That Implicate First Amendment\nConcerns.\nIn order to make its fundamentally flawed First Amendment argument, the DCCC\nmischaracterizes the Subpoena. Despite the DCCC’s assertion, Plaintiffs do not seek documents\nrelating to the DCCC’s “most sensitive information” (Opp. at 1) or the “DCCC’s analysis of the\n2012 Congressional elections in Illinois, redistricting’s impact on those elections, and DCCC’s\nefforts to recruit candidates to run against Plaintiffs” (Opp. at 7). Indeed, nowhere does the\nsubpoena request any of the types of materials the DCCC highlights as sensitive—the subpoena\ndoes not request documents regarding election analysis, campaign strategy, internal DCCC\nstrategy, membership lists, or any information about private individuals. On the contrary,\nPlaintiffs have made a confined request for documents related only to the DCCC’s involvement\nin the fundamentally public process of redistricting in Illinois. The request is limited in both\nsubject matter and time. Moreover, counsel for the Plaintiffs reiterated the limited nature of the\ninformation sought to counsel for the DCCC before filing this motion specifically to respond to\nany concerns that the DCCC might legitimately have had about the Subpoena’s scope. It is\ntellingthat even with this information, the DCCC still maintains that the Subpoena is an attempt\ntounearth “sensitiveinformation”whenclearlyitisnot.\n9\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /5121  o  fP 1a4g8e  P1a1g oefI D24 #:909\nThe information Plaintiffs request is quite simply not the kind of information that the\nFirst Amendment privilege aims to protect, and the DCCC’s protests to the contrary are off the\nmark. The DCCC primarily relies on Wyoming v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, 208 F.R.D. 449\n(D.D.C. 2002) in support of its claim that the First Amendment privilege extends to a wide\nvariety of information. But the request for information that the Court rejected in Wyoming was\nbreathtaking in scope. Plaintiffs there sought discovery from three environmental groups that\nhad lobbied the Department of Agriculture on forest management regulations. Id. at 452. The\n“broad range of documents” that Plaintiffs sought included not only material related to the\ngroups’ contacts with the Department, but also all of their internal communications about the\nregulations as well as all communication about the regulations among the three subpoena\nrespondents or with ten other environmental organizations not served. Id. Plaintiffs’ narrowly\ntailored Subpoena is nothinglike the request in Wyoming: it is narrow in both subject matter and\ntime. Moreover, the Subpoena requests documents related to communications with Illinois state\nlegislators andother electedofficials;theDCCCshouldhavenoexpectationofprivacyrelatedto\ncommunications with public figures, particularly where, as here, those communications relate to\nthe formulation and passage of a public law.5 Wyoming simply does not speak to this case. See\nalso Int’l Action Center v. U.S., 207 F.R.D. 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2002) (“The breadth of information\nsoughtbythegovernmentis,tosaytheleast,extraordinary.”).\n5 Throughout the entireredistrictingprocess, Democraticlawmakers stated again and again\nthat their goal was to “make this the most open redistricting process in Illinois history.” See\nApril 1, 2011 statement of Illinois Senate President John J. Cullerton, available at\nhttp://senatedem.illinois.gov/index.php/issues/veterans/benefit-information-for-veterans/1688--\nredistricting-hearings-begin-public-input-encouraged. Further, when Governor Quinn signed the\nbill enacting the Plan, he commended the “openness and transparency in the remap process.”\nSeeJune3,2011 StatementofGovernorPatQuinn,attachedheretoas ExhibitC.\n10\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /5131  o  fP 1a4g8e  P1a2g oefI D24 #:910\nThe DCCC also cites Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 591 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2010), but Perry\nis no more helpful. That case involved the “internal campaign communications relating to\ncampaign strategy and advertising” of a private political organization that had sponsored\nCalifornia’s controversial anti-same-sex marriage initiative. Id. at 1152. Plaintiffs here\nrepeatedly have emphasized that they do not seek any information about the DCCC’s internal\ncampaign communications or strategy, which purportedly “lie at the core of DCCC's\nassociational mission to recruit and support Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives.” Opp. at 12. On the contrary, Plaintiffs only seek information about the\nDCCC’s influence on the state legislature and other public officials in Illinois in drawing the\ndisputedPlan.\nThe DCCC hangs its hat on the assertion that the First Amendment privilege extends\nbeyond membership lists. Opp. at 10. But there is no denying that exposure of a group’s\nmembers and supporters, and the effect of that exposure on the members’ associational rights, is\nthe fundamental harm the privilege aims to protect. See NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462\n(1958) (Supreme Court recognizes the “vital relationship between freedom to associate and\nprivacy in one’s associations.”). As demonstrated by several cases cited by the DCCC, the\nconcern withexposingmembershiporsupporters remains the animatingforcebehindrecognition\noftheprivilege. See, e.g.,Int’lActionCenter.,207 F.R.D. at2 (informationaboutparticipantsor\npotential participants at protest is “exactly the kind of information the First Amendment is\ndesigned to protect”); Britt v. Superior Court, 20 Cal. 3d 844, 852 (Cal. 1978) (“In compelling\nthe wholesale disclosure of private association affiliations and activities, the challenged\ndiscovery order works an unconstitutional infringement of First Amendment rights.”); Wilkinson\nv.

The Subpoena does not seek donor lists,\nmembership lists, or any information about the DCCC’s so-called “adherents.” See Mook Decl.\nat 2. Plaintiffs seek nothing more than information about the DCCC’s role in the entirely\nexternal activity of drawing a congressional redistricting Plan in concert with the Illinois\nlegislature—a process that is fundamentally public and which the DCCC chose to insert itself\ninto. Having gotten itself involved in this publicprocess, the DCCC cannot now hide behind the\nFirst Amendment. Moreover, the DCCC’s involvement was with third party public figures; it\nsimply is not credible to now maintain that the DCCC thought that those communications were\nprotectedbythe FirstAmendment.\nB. Plaintiffs’SubpoenaWillNotCauseA“ChillingEffect.”\nThe DCCC cannot establish a First Amendment harm for another reason: its assertion of\na chilling effect (Opp. at 12, Mook Decl. at 3) simply is not credible. See New York State Nat’l\nAssoc. for Women v. Terry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1355 (2d cir. 1989) (compelling discovery where\ndefendant could not explain how requests would actually interfere with First Amendment\nactivities). TheDCCC cannot plausiblycontend that “enforcementof the discoveryrequests will\nresult in (1) harassment, membership withdrawal, or discouragement of new members, or other\nconsequences which objectively suggest an impact on, or chilling of, the members’ associational\nrights.” Perry, 591 F.3d at 1160 (internal quotations omitted). As established repeatedly, the\ninformation sought has nothing to do with the DCCC’s members or core membership and in no\nwayimpinges ontheDCCCmembers’freedomofassociation.\n12\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /5151  o  fP 1a4g8e  P1a4g oefI D24 #:912\nMoreover, as explained above (at 11-12), a First Amendment privilege exists to protect\n“the vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one’s associations.” Int’l\nUnion v. Nat’l RighttoWorkLegal Defenseand Educ. Found’n,Inc., 590 F.2d 1139, 1152 (D.C.\nCir. 1978) (citing NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462 (1958)) (emphasis added). The\nreasoning behind the privilege is that “public identification of individuals who never intended\ntheirparticipation in First Amendment activityto thrust theminto theharsh glare of thelimelight\nis calculated to chill future political dissent and discourage participation in other protest\nactivity.” Int’l Action Center, 207 F.R.D. at 3-4. It is exposure of association that is behind the\nso-called chillingeffectofcompliancewithdiscovery. See,e.g.,Uphaus v. Wyman,360 U.S.72,\n78 (1959) (interest at stake was associational privacy); Superior Court of San Diego County v.\nSan Diego Unified Port Dist., 574 Pac. 2d 766, 768 (Cal. 1978) (“intrusion into associational\nprivacy” is what the First Amendment privilege prevents); Fed. Election Comm’n v. Machinists\nNon-Partisan Political League, 655 F.2d 380, (D.D.C. 1981) (“[F]irst [A]mendment interest in\nprivacyofpoliticalassociation”threatenedbysubpoena).\nIn a different context, a claim about the expectation of privacy of an interest group’s\nmembers might have some relevancy; here, with the DCCC, that argument is entirely specious.\nThe DCCC’s membership consists of public officials, namely Democrat congresspersons, whose\npolitical associations are well known. The DCCC describes itself as “the official campaign arm\nof the Democrats in the House [of Representatives].” http://www.dccc.org/pages/about\n(emphasis added). In its own words, the DCCC is “[o]rganized and operated by Democratic\nmembers of the House of Representatives.” See FEC Advisory Op. 1985-14 attached hereto as\nExhibit D. Like all public office holders, Democratic members of the House of Representatives\nhave willingly stepped into “harsh glare of the limelight” and opened their political associations\n13\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /5161  o  fP 1a4g8e  P1a5g oefI D24 #:913\nto public scrutiny. Because of this clear willingness to engage in political activity in the most\npublic way possible, the contention that such public figures will be discouraged or “chilled”—\nthattheymight actuallybecome reluctant to beDemocraticCongresspersons—is laughable. The\nDCCCcannotclaimprivilegebased merelyona FirstAmendment interest inassociating. Asthe\nDCCC itself concedes (Opp. at 11), it must demonstrate harm to that interest, and this it cannot\ndo.\nThe DCCC’s reliance on Wyoming is misplaced in this regard as well. The groups\nasserting a First Amendment interest in that case were environmental organizations consisting of\nprivate citizens, not public officials. Wyoming, 208 F.R.D. at 451. Unlike the members of the\nDCCC, members of those groups had not willingly exposed their political activities to public\nview. The DCCC is not the Heritage Forest Campaign, id., nor is it ProtectMarriage.com—Yes\non 8, Perry, 591 F.3d at 1147, and it is certainly not the NAACP’s Alabama affiliate in 1958,\nNAACP, 357 U.S. at 451. The District of Columbia Circuit recognized decades ago that “the\nargument in favor of upholdingthe claim of privilege will ordinarily grow stronger as the danger\nto rights of expression and association increases.” Black Panther Party v. Smith, 661 F.2d 1243,\n1267 (1981). Here, the DCCC’s cry of “chill”—made in a declaration from a highly public\nfigure in the world of Democrat politics6—shows the argument at its weakest. The DCCC does\n6 DCCC employee Robert E. Mook, Executive Director, although not a Congressman, is a\nhighlypublic figure who, according to the Washington Post, took over as “the head of the House\nDemocrats’ campaign arm for the 2012 election.” See http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-\ndyn/content/article/2010/12/05/AR2010120504745.html. The DCCC’s own December 6, 2010\npress release details Mr. Mook’s high profile political activities, including that “Mook served as\nthe DCCC’s Political Director since the beginning of 2009. In that capacity he oversaw\ncandidate recruitment, campaign planning and strategy.

Even If First Amendment Rights Are Implicated, Production Of The\nDCCC’SResponsiveDocumentsIs Warranted.\nEven if the DCCC had a colorable claim that its First Amendment interests are\nthreatened—which it does not—Plaintiffs nonetheless should be permitted discoverybecause the\ndocuments at issue in this case directly go to the “heart of the lawsuit.” Wyoming, 208 F.R.D. at\n455. Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that the Plan intentionally dilutes the votes of Latinos, enacts\nan unconstitutional racial gerrymander, and engages in blatant partisan gerrymandering. On\ninformation and belief, the DCCC, with and through its Illinois congressional members and its\nagents, influenced the creation of the map that was eventually adopted by the Illinois General\nAssembly. The intent of the DCCC thus became the intent of the Illinois legislature. The goals,\nconsiderations, and motivations that influenced the DCCC in creating the map therefore are\ncritical to establishing that that the Plan was intended to disenfranchise Latino and Republican\nvoters in Illinois. See, e.g., Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S.\n252, 268 (1977) (recognizing that legislators “might be called to the stand at trial to testify\nconcerning the purpose of the official action”); Rodriguez v. Pataki, 280 F. Supp. 2d 89, 102\n(S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“While evidence of discriminatory animus may not be an essential element of\nall of the plaintiffs’ claims, it certainly is something that can be considered in deciding whether\nthe . . . redistricting plans pass judicial muster.”). United States v. Irvin, 127 F.R.D. 169, 171-\nnominee Senator John Kerry.” See http://dccc.org/blog/entry/dccc_chairman_steve_israel\nnames_robby_mook_dccc_executive_director/.\n15\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /5181  o  fP 1a4g8e  P1a7g oefI D24 #:915\n173 (C.D. Cal. 1989) (“evidence concerning the intent with which the [redistricting body]\nadoptedtheplanand rejectedcertainalternatives,”ishighly-relevant).\nThe centrality of the evidence requested here makes this case very different from\nWyoming. There, the court found that the documents were irrelevant to the State of Wyoming’s\nclaims under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (“FACA”). Wyoming, 208 F.R.D. at 453.\nUnder that statute, what mattered for the state’s claim was the degree of control the government\nexercised over the interest groups, and the interest groups’ activities had no impact on whether\nthe defendant violated FACA. Id. at 454. Here, the situation is reversed: it is the DCCC’s\ncontrol over the Illinois mapping process that is central to the litigation. Thus, Plaintiffs must be\nallowedto gather evidencerelatingtothatinfluence.\nMoreover, and again in contrast to Wyoming, these documents cannot be obtained from\nanother source, with or without reasonable efforts. Plaintiffs have sued the Illinois State Board\nof Elections and its members (collectively “SBE”) to enjoin their use of the Proposed\nCongressional Plan in the upcoming 2012 congressional elections. But, unlike the DCCC, the\nSBE has admitted that it, not surprisingly, had no role in the development of the Plan and\ntherefore possesses no documents evidencing any intent to dilute the voting strength of Illinois\nLatinos and/or Republicans. Thus, unlike Wyoming, where party discovery clearly was a\nsuperioralternativetothecontestedsubpoena, seeid.at455,nopartyinthis casecanprovidethe\nevidencethatis intheDCCC’spossession.\nThe DCCC’s reliance on American Fed. of Labor and Congress of Indus. Orgs. v. Fed.\nElection Comm’n, 333 F.3d 168 (D.C. Cir. 2003) also is misplaced. American Federation\ninvolved an FEC regulation requiring disclosure to the public of FEC investigatory files.

The DCCC is required only to turn over its responsive documents to\nPlaintiffs, who repeatedlyhaveexpressed theirwillingness to abidebyan agreed-upon protective\norder. See Mot. ¶ 32. See also Nat’l Org. for Marriage v. McKee, 723 F. Supp. 2d 236, 240-41\n(D.Me.2010)(alleged chillingeffectnegatedbyprotectiveorder).\nIV. Plaintiffs Clearly Have Established A Substantial Need For The Requested\nDocuments.\nThe DCCC asserts no sound basis for claiming that its records constitute material akin to\ntrade secrets. “Courts typically consider two factors in analyzing Rule 45 cases, beginning with\nwhether the release of the information would unfairly harm the disclosing party’s ability to\ncompete in the marketplace.” Albany Molecular Research, 274 F.R.D. at 25. Notwithstanding\nthe DCCC’s mischaracterization of Plaintiffs’ requests, Plaintiffs do not seek material regarding\nthe DCCC’s strategies with respect to competing in the 2012 congressional elections—in Illinois\nor anywhere else. Plaintiffs’ Subpoena only seeks a narrow set of documents directly related to\nthe DCCC’s role in the creation of the Plan at issue in the underlying action. The DCCC has not\nestablished, as it must, how production of those documents will work a competitive harm on the\nDCCC. Therefore these materials should not be considered confidential information under Rule\n45.\nBecause harm to a competitive position is the central concern, the second factor a court\nconsiders is whether the information is being disclosed to a competitor. Falicia v. Advanced\nTenant Services, Inc., 235 F.R.D. 5, 7 (D.D.C. 2006). Competitive interests are not implicated\nby the information requested by the Subpoena, and the authority relied upon by the DCCC is\ninapplicable. See Echostar Commc’ns Corp. v. News Corp. Ltd., 180 F.R.D. 391, 395 (D. Colo.\n1998) (“No one disputes that Echostar is a competitor of the non-parties.”); see also Educ.\nLogistics, Inc. v. Laidlaw Transit, Inc., 2011 WL 1348401, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 8, 2011)\n17\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /6101  o  fP 1a4g8e  P1a9g oefI D24 #:917\n(requesting party was a “direct competitor” of the subpoena target). The DCCC’s competitor is\nthe National Republican Congressional Committee (“NRCC”), a non-party to this or the\nunderlying action. SeeOpp. at12,17. Thefact thatPlaintiff Congressman John Shimkus also is\nan officer of the NRCC is irrelevant; the NRCC is not a party to this or the underlying action,\nandthereforeno informationwill bedisclosed to it. Moreover, to alleviate theDCCC’s apparent\nconcerns in this regard (see Opp. at 1, 2, 5, 17; Mook Decl. ¶ 4), Plaintiffs have made clear their\nwillingness to enter into a reasonable protective order to safeguard the DCCC’s documents.\nMot.¶32; seealso AlbanyMolecular Research, 274 F.R.D. at26 (“Theexistence of aprotective\norder weighs against quashing the subpoena on commercial information grounds because the\nprotective order is designed to protect and prevent public disclosure of confidential and sensitive\nbusinessinformation,likethatpotentiallyatissuehere.”).\nEven if the DCCC had a cognizable trade secret or confidentiality interest, Plaintiffs\nplainly have a “substantial need for the . . . material that cannot be otherwise met without undue\nhardship.” FED. R. CIV. P. 45(c)(3)(C)(i). To show substantial need, the requesting party must\ndemonstrate that “obtaining the information is both relevant and necessary” to the underlying\nlitigation. Falicia, 235 F.R.D. at 7. See also Compaq Computer Corp. v. Packard Bell\nElectronics,Inc.,163 F.R.D.329,338(N.D.Cal. 1995)(“[D]iscoveryisvirtuallyalwaysordered\nonce the movant has established that the secret information is [both] relevant and necessary.”).\nPlaintiffs amply have demonstrated that the requested documents are highly relevant to their\ncase. Fundamentally, now two members of Congress have testified under oath that two different\nDemocratic lawmakers, one a Congressman and the other the President of the Illinois State\nSenate, informed themthattheDCCC and/orone ofits agents drew the map comprisingthe Plan\nPlaintiffs challenge in the underlying action. Nowhere in its Opposition does the DCCC deny\n18\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /6111  o  fP 1a4g8e  P2a0g oefI D24 #:918\nthis. Thus, the DCCC’s documents relating to the drafting process are not merely relevant but\nessential to showingthe intent ofDCCC and of Illinois legislators with whomtheycooperated as\nto the constitutionally infirm Plan. Plaintiffs’ Subpoena requests therefore are “probing the\nprecise topic” of how the Plan was created and why. Athridge v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., 184\nF.R.D. 200, 210 (D.D.C. 1998). Documents responsive to the Subpoena clearly exist as the\nDCCC admits (Opp. at 18), Plaintiffs have established a legitimate use for such documents in\nthat they are central to proving the intent behind the Plan, and the narrowness of the Subpoena’s\nrequests demonstratethat this is not afishing expedition. SeeCusumano v. Microsoft Corp., 162\nF.3d708,716(1stCir.1998).\nFurthermore, there are no other easier or less intrusive ways for Plaintiffs to obtain\nessential and admissible direct evidence of intent other than from the very party who created the\nPlan. See Kulzer v. Esschem, Inc., 390 F. App’x 88, 93 (3d Cir. 2010) (substantial need for\nconfidential information demonstrated where respondent was only available source of\ninformation). Other parties’ testimony about what the DCCC and its agents did or did not do\nconcerningthe Plan is of course hearsay and likely not admissible. Consequently, the best, most\nrelevant, and admissible source of evidence about what the DCCC intended concerning the\ndrafting of the Plan comes from the DCCC itself.7 Thus, compelling the DCCC’s production of\ndocuments responsive to the Subpoena is necessary to provide evidence for Plaintiffs to prove\nthat the individuals and entities who drew the Plan intended to disenfranchise Latino and\n7 The DCCC has argued that the better alternative source for the information is the Illinois\nlegislature. However, as the DCCC well knows, individual legislators and their staff have\nasserted blanket, absolute legislative immunity from discovery and asserted that the documents\ncan be obtained from the DCCC. Moreover, even if the Plaintiffs are able to obtain some\ninformation from the Illinois legislature, any such evidence or testimony about the DCCC’s\nactions will likely face a hearsay challenge. As such, the DCCC is, of course, the best source of\nadmissibleevidenceaboutitsownactions indraftingthePlan.\n19\n\nCase:C 1a:s1e1 -1c:v1-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-mDeAnRt  #  :D 9o0c-u1m Feilnetd 1: 31 0  / 2F4il/e1d1  0P9a/g2e9 /6121  o  fP 1a4g8e  P2a1g oefI D24 #:919\nRepublican voters in Illinois. And, it makes the most sense to obtain documents related to these\ncommunications directly from the source. For these reasons, Plaintiffs plainlyhave a substantial\nneedforthedocumentsrequestedbytheSubpoena.\nV. The DCCC Is Not Excused From Compliance With The Federal Rules Of Civil\nProcedure.\nA. TheDCCC’s AttemptToSealIts PrivilegeLogIsImproper.\nThe DCCC’s Opposition asserts that the entirety of the nearly 800 pages of responsive\nmaterial is subject to privilege and has been identified in a privilege log. Opp. at 18. If the\nDCCC truly considers these documents privileged, Rule 45 mandates that the DCCC must\ndescribe the nature of the documents not produced or disclosed and do so in a manner that,\nwithoutrevealinginformation itselfprivileged or protected, will enableotherparties to assess the\nclaim. FED. R. CIV. P. 45(d)(2)(A); see also In re Apollo Group, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2007 WL\n778653, at *8 (D.D.C. March 12, 2007) (“To the extent the DOE maintains that it is not required\ntoproducethedocumentssoughtintheAmended Subpoenaonthegrounds ofvariousprivileges,\nthe DOE must comply with its obligations under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(d)(2) and\nproduce a privilege log that allows Apollo and the Court to assess the validity of the claimed\nprivileges.”). Rather than provide Plaintiffs with a copy of the log as is its duty, the DCCC filed\na motion for leave to file its privilege log under seal. See Opp. at 18. The DCCC has cited no\ncase law in support of its extraordinary request. In response, Plaintiffs have filed an Opposition\nto the DCCC’s Motion For Leave To File Privilege Log Under Seal, which is incorporated by\nreferenceas thoughfullysetforthherein.\nB. TheDCCCStillRefusesToArticulateSpecificObjections.\nAs set forth in Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel, Rule 34 “plainly states that objections to\nrequests for production must be made on an individual basis.” Lurensky v.

And “[u]nder Rule 34, failure to make particularized objections to\ndocument requests constitutes a waiver of those objections.” Sabol v. Brooks, 469 F. Supp. 2d\n324, 328 (D.

Bauer, Esq. \nPerkins, Coie, Stone, Olsen & Williams \n1110 Vermont Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20005 \n \nDear Mr. Bauer: \n \nThis responds to your letters of March 18 and April 9, 1985, requesting an advisory opinion on \nbehalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (\"DCCC\"), concerning \napplication of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (\"the Act\"), and \nCommission regulations to the allocation and reporting of expenditures for certain political \nadvertisements. \n \nDCCC is registered with the Commission as a party-related, multicandidate political committee. \nYou state that DCCC is \"[o]rganized and operated by Democratic members of the House of \nRepresentatives\" and \"functions broadly as a national party organization in support of \nDemocratic candidates to the House, as well as other public offices around the country.\" You \nstate that DCCC plans to initiate a program involving criticism of the records of individual \nRepublican members of the House of Representatives and of the activities of Republican \nMembers of Congress as a class. Some of these Republican members may not be announced \ncandidates for the 1986 elections, while some will have qualified as candidates pursuant to the \nAct. See 2 U.S.C. 431(2). \n \nYou state that DCCC plans to focus its program in 20-100 selected congressional districts but \nmay expand it to include all districts represented by Republicans. You add that DCCC's program \nwill have \"the clear purpose of influencing voter perceptions of these candidates with a view \ntoward weakening their positions as candidates for re-election in 1986.\" You state that some of \nthe proposed communications will refer to the next or the last election, while other \ncommunications will criticize a congressman's record without any reference to any election or \nwithout any express advocacy language. These communications will include television and radio \n\nCaseC: 1a:s1e1 1-c:1v-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-DmAeRnt   # D: 9o0cu-1m Feinlet d1:3 1-01/ 2  4 F/1ile1d P 0a9g/e2 91/1141  o  fP 1a4g8e P 4a9g oefI D5 4#:971\nbroadcasts, newspaper and other print advertising, and direct mail brochures. You propose to \nproduce and disseminate these communications currently and in September 1985.1 \n \nIn this context, you have provided the scripts for radio and television broadcasts and the text for \na direct mail brochure: \n \n\"PLIERS AND TOILET SEATS\" (Radio/TV) \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee \n \nBackground: Loud laughter and applause \n \nVoice No. 1: What's going on? What's so funny? \n \nVoice No. 2: (laughing intermittently): Oh, that's the President getting a good \nlaugh from the crowd in Washington, the Republicans in Congress. He says we \nshould take care of the farm crisis by keeping the grain (begins to burst into \nuncontrolled laughter)-- and exporting the farmers!!! \n \nVoice No. 1: (with anger): That's not funny at all; this farm crisis is real and \nendangering the very existence of family farms. People are really suffering. \n \nVoice No. 1: Who cares? The Republicans sure don't. So just join the crowd and \nhave a good laugh. \n \nAnnouncer: But it is not a laughing matter. The President and his Republican \nsupporters in Congress are enjoying this joke at the expense of the American \nfarmer--but the last laugh is on you and on your children. And while the \nRepublicans are breaking every election-year promise they ever made to the \nAmerican farmer, they just look on and smile when multi-billion dollar defense \ncontractors charge you--the taxpayer--$______ for a pair of pliers and $______ \nfor a toilet seat. That's the real joke. \n \n(Pause) \n \nAnnouncer: Let your Republican Congressman know that you don't think this is \nfunny. \n(Or, in some ads: Let the Republicans in Congress know what you think about \ntheir sense of humor.) \n[In some scripts, the text closes with \"Vote Democratic\"] \n \n\nCaseC: 1a:s1e1 1-c:1v-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-DmAeRnt   # D: 9o0cu-1m Feinlet d1:3 1-01/ 2  4 F/1ile1d P 0a9g/e2 91/1151  o  fP 1a4g8e P 5a0g oefI D5 4#:972\n\"Crumbling Foundation\" (Radio/TV) \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee \n \nSound: A crumbling, cracking sound of something \"giving away.\" \n \nAnnouncer (with sound in background): You read the newspaper nowadays and \nwhat do you find: stories about collapsing banks, people in a panic over the loss \nof their savings, federal and state government coming up with rescue plans and \nbailouts. \n \n(Sound in background get louder) \n \nAnnouncer: It all sounds too familiar, like 1932, but it's not then. It's now. And it's \nreal. \n \n(Sound in background increases in volume) \n \nAnnouncer: The President and his Republican allies in Congress are all smiles, \nthey tell us not to worry. But under their leadership, the budget deficit grows to \nmonstrous proportions, Wall Street is nervous, the dollar begins to show signs of \nweakness. \n \n(Sound comes to fore, very loud and then replaced by a moment of silence) \n \nAnnouncer: We've seen all this before: let's make sure it doesn't happen again.

You have presented several specific questions: \n \n1. Would broadcast advertisements and other general public communications (e.g. direct mail, \nleaflets, etc.) that specifically identify Republican congressmen and criticize their records, \nrequire allocation under 11 CFR 106.1(a) and AO 1984-15? Does the answer depend on whether \nthe communications contain reference to \"elections\" or any \"express advocacy\" language? \n \n2. Would broadcast advertisements and other general public communications that criticize the \nactivities and record of Republican congressmen as a class require allocation under 11 CFR \n106.1(a) and AO 1984-15 to the individual Democratic candidates, when ultimately nominated \nby the Democratic Party? \n \n3. Does the answer to question 2 differ if DCCC directs these \"generic\" critiques to selected \ncongressional districts? \n \nDCCC's payments for these communications are reportable expenditures for the purpose of \ninfluencing Federal elections, and the sources of the funds used by DCCC to make these \nexpenditures are subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act. See 2 U.S.C. 434, 441a, \n441b, 441c, 441e, and 441f. Your questions relate to whether these expenditures are attributable \nto a specific candidate or candidates and, thus, subject to the Act's limitations on those \ncontributions or expenditures made by DCCC. \n \nYou state that there may be no Democratic candidate, either announced or qualified under the \nAct, in the congressional districts selected to receive DCCC's proposed communications. Thus, \nthe Commission assumes that DCCC's expenditures for these communications will not be made \nin cooperation or consultation with any candidate.2  Instead, the Commission views your request \nas limited to the situation where expenditures for these communications are made without any \nconsultation or cooperation, or any request or suggestion of, candidates seeking election to the \nHouse of Representatives in the selected districts. \n \nIn this context, the Act's limitations at 2 U.S.C. 441a(d) become relevant since the Commission \nhas stated that expenditures pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 441a(d) may be made without consultation or \ncoordination with any candidate and may be made before the party's general election candidates \nare nominated. See Advisory Opinion 1984-15.3  This section permits \"the national committee of \na political party\" to make additional expenditures, subject to certain specific dollar limitations, \n\"in connection with the general election campaign of a candidate for\" the House of \nRepresentatives \"who is affiliated with such party.\" 2 U.S.C. 441a(d)(3).4  A national committee \nof a political party, as defined at 2 U.S.C. 431(14), may designate the party's congressional \ncampaign committee as its agent for purposes of making these expenditures, if such designation \noccurs before the designee committee makes the expenditures. See 11 CFR 110.7(a)(4); FEC v. \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, 454 U.S. 27, 28-29 (1981); First General Counsel's \nReport, MUR 1460.5\n \n\nCaseC: 1a:s1e1 1-c:1v-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-DmAeRnt   # D: 9o0cu-1m Feinlet d1:3 1-01/ 2  4 F/1ile1d P 0a9g/e2 91/1181  o  fP 1a4g8e P 5a3g oefI D5 4#:975\nIn Advisory Opinion 1984-15, the Commission considered the application of the limitations of 2 \nU.S.C. 441a(d) to expenditures for political advertising similar to DCCC's proposed \ncommunications. There, the Commission concluded that the limitations of 441a(d) would apply \nwhere the communication both (1) depicted a clearly identified candidate and (2) conveyed an \nelectioneering message. See also Advisory Opinion 1978-46. Under the Act and regulations, a \ncandidate is clearly identified if his or her name or likeness appears or if his or her identity is \napparent by unambiguous reference. 2 U.S.C. 431(18); 11 CFR 106.1(d). Electioneering \nmessages include statements \"designed to urge the public to elect a certain candidate or party.\" \nUnited States v. United Auto Workers, 352 U.S. 567, 587 (1957); see Advisory Opinion 1984-\n62. \n \nBoth the \"Pliers and Toilet Seats\" and the \"Crumbling Foundation\" scripts offer two alternative \ntaglines: one referring to \"your Republican Congressman\" and one referring to \"the Republicans \nin Congress.\" You further state that some scripts will also close with a \"Vote Democratic\" \nstatement. The Commission concludes that DCCC's expenditures for its proposed radio and \ntelevision advertisements (with scripts as set forth in this opinion) that use the tagline, \"the \nRepublicans in Congress,\" either with or without the \"Vote Democratic\" statement (or other \nelectioneering message), will not be subject to the Act's limitations. In addition, the Commission \nconcludes that DCCC's expenditures for its proposed advertisements that use the tagline, \"your \nRepublican Congressman,\" without the \"Vote Democratic\" statement, will also not be subject to \nthe Act's limitations. Instead DCCC may report these expenditures as operating expenditures. \nSee 11 CFR 104.3(b). These conclusions also apply where the advertisements are directed to \nonly selected congressional districts. \n \nWith respect to DCCC expenditures for the proposed radio and television advertisements that use \nthe tagline, \"your Republican Congressman,\" together with the \"Vote Democratic\" statement, the \nCommission considered alternative responses but on a tie vote was unable to agree whether such \nexpenditures would or would not be subject to the Act's limitations and attributable pursuant to \n11 CFR 106.1. See 11 CFR 112.4(a). \n \nWith regard to DCCC's proposed sample mailer, the Commission assumes that its references to \n\"Cong. X\" indicate that a specific congressman will be identified by name. The Commission also \nassumes that the mailer's dissemination may include part or all of the district represented by the \nidentified congressman. The Commission concludes that DCCC's expenditures for producing and \ndisseminating the mailer either with or without the \"Vote Democratic\" statement will be subject \nto the Act's limitations and attributable pursuant to 11 CFR 106.1. \n \nYou have indicated that DCCC's proposed program is for the purpose of influencing the 1986 \nelection process and that these activities will be scheduled for approximately the next month and \nfor September 1985. The Commission emphasizes that this opinion is limited to the timetable \nyou have specified and does not address the implementation of the same or a similar program at \nsome later date. \n \nThe Commission notes the foregoing discussion responds to the three questions you presented in \nyour letter dated March 18, 1985. \n \n\nCaseC: 1a:s1e1 1-c:1v-10-5m0c6-50 0D5o1c4u-DmAeRnt   # D: 9o0cu-1m Feinlet d1:3 1-01/ 2  4 F/1ile1d P 0a9g/e2 91/1191  o  fP 1a4g8e P 5a4g oefI D5 4#:976\nThis response constitutes an advisory opinion concerning application of the Act, or regulations \nprescribed by the Commission, to the specific transaction or activities set forth in your request. \nSee 2 U.S.C. 437f. \n \nSincerely yours, \n \n(signed) \n \nJohn Warren McGarry \nChairman for the Federal Election Commission \n \n \nEnclosures (AOs 1984-62, 1984-15, 1980-119, and 1978-46) \n \n \n1. Your request indicates a schedule of April and September 1985, but you also note that this \nproposed schedule as to April will be adjusted depending on the timing of the Commission's \nresponse to your request. \n \n2. See 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(7)(B)(i); 11 CFR 104.3(b) and 104.13(a). \n \n3. This interpretation is consistent with the reporting requirements. Expenditures made under \n441a(d) and 11 CFR 110.7 are reported as expenditures by the committee making them. 11 CFR \n104.3(b)(3)(viii). The candidate on whose behalf such expenditures are made, however, does not \nreport these expenditures as contributions. 11 CFR 104.3(a)(3)(iii). \n \n4. Party political committees are incapable of making independent expenditures. 11 CFR \n110.7(a)(5) and (b)(4); Advisory Opinions 1984-15 and 1980-119; General Counsel's Report, \nMUR 273. \n \n5. For purposes of this advisory opinion, the Commission assumes that DCCC is or will be the \ndesignated agent of the national committee of the Democratic Party for the purpose of making \nexpenditures pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 441a(d)(3). This expenditure limitation is in addition to the \nlimitation on contributions by DCCC pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(2)(A). See 11 CFR \n110.7(b)(3); H.R. Rep.

U.S. CONST. ART. I,  § 2; id.\namend. XIV, §§ 1 & 2; id. AMEND. XV; Ryan v. State Bd. of Elections of State of Ill., 661 F.2d\n1130, 1132 (7th Cir. 1981).  Pursuant to this authority, the Illinois General Assembly drafted,\ndebated, and passed the Illinois Congressional Redistricting Act of 2011 (the “Redistricting\nAct”) (P.A. 97-14).  The Redistricting Act eliminates one congressional seat, as required by the\n2010 United States Census results, and establishes boundaries for the state’s eighteen remaining\ncongressional districts.  \nBeginning on March 28, 2011, and continuing through May 2, 2011, members of the\nIllinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate held a series of public hearings at\nlocations around the state where members of the public were allowed to comment on the\nredistricting process.  See 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 125/10-5.  On May 27, 2011, the Democratic\nleadership of the Illinois House and Senate Redistricting Committees released the congressional\nredistricting plan (“2011 Map”) on its website.  Three days later, the Illinois House of\nRepresentatives passed the Redistricting Act, and the next day the Illinois Senate followed suit. \nOn June 24, 2011, the Governor signed the Redistricting Act into law, and the present litigation\nensued.   \nThe plaintiffs comprise three groups: The Committee for a Fair and Balanced Map, a not-\nfor-profit organization created by Illinois citizens concerned about the congressional redistricting\nprocess in Illinois; nine Republican Congressmen and one Republican Congresswoman; and six\nregistered voters, four of whom are identified as Latino and two as Republican (collectively\n2\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::1 11:-1c1v--c0v5-006550 6D5o Dcuomcuemnte #n:t  9#0: -717  F Fileiledd: :1 100/2/142/1/111 P Paaggee 1 32 3o fo 2f 31 4P8a PgeaIgDe I#D:7 #1:0980\n“plaintiffs”).  The defendants include the Illinois State Board of Elections, the agency charged\nwith implementing the 2011 Map, and its individual members (collectively “defendants”).\nPlaintiffs allege that the 2011 Map discriminates against Latino and Republican voters,\nand they seek to invalidate the redistricting plan in whole or in part.  Specifically, plaintiffs\nallege that the 2011 Map violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (“VRA”)\n(Count I), the Fourteenth Amendment (Count II) and the Fifteenth Amendment (Count III) by\ndiluting the voting strength of Latino voters.  Plaintiffs also claim that the 2011 Map constitutes\nan impermissible racial gerrymander in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count IV) and a\npartisan gerrymander in violation the First Amendment (Count V) and Fourteenth Amendment\n(Count VI).  \nThe parties have engaged in expedited discovery.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 45, plaintiffs served thirty subpoenas duces tecum1 on a number of non-party entities\nand individuals, including the (i) Illinois House of Representatives (through Tim Mapes, Chief\nof Staff); (ii) Office of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives (through Tim Mapes,\nChief of Staff); (iii) Illinois House Redistricting Committee (through Barbara Flynn Currie,\nChairperson); (iv) Illinois Senate (through Jillayne Rock, Secretary of the Senate); (v) Office of\nthe Senate President (through Andrew Manar, Chief of Staff); (vi) Illinois Senate Redistricting\nCommittee (through Kwame Raoul, Chairperson); and (vii) various legislative staffers with\nknowledge of the reapportionment scheme (collectively “Non-Parties”).  The subpoenas contain\n1 The United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois issued twenty-five of the\nthirty subpoenas served by plaintiffs because most of subpoenaed witnesses reside in Springfield, Illinois. \nThe remaining five subpoenas were issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nIllinois.  According to Non-Parties, the Northern District of Illinois subpoenas capture all of the\ndocuments within the scope of the Central District of Illinois subpoenas, including those possessed by the\nIllinois House and Senate Redistricting Committees and individual staff members. \n3\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::1 11:-1c1v--c0v5-006550 6D5o Dcuomcuemnte #n:t  9#0: -717  F Fileiledd: :1 100/2/142/1/111 P Paaggee 1 42 4o fo 2f 31 4P8a PgeaIgDe I#D:7 #1:1981\ntwenty-one requests for production encompassing documents and communications related to the\n2011 Map.  Non-Parties refused to comply with plaintiffs’ requests, claiming that legislative\nimmunity, the deliberative process privilege, the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-\nproduct doctrine protect the documents from disclosure.     \nOn September 15, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion to compel enforcement of the third party\nsubpoenas.  The next day, the President of the Illinois Senate, the Speaker of the Illinois House\nof Representatives, and the chairpersons of the Illinois House and Senate Redistricting\nCommittees moved to quash.  Each party was allowed to file a response and this three-judge\ncourt heard arguments on September 29, 2011. \nANALYSIS\nI.   Relevance of Requested Discovery\nPlaintiffs have served Non-Parties with twenty-one document requests. \nA. Requested Documents\nPlaintiffs seek a plethora of documents concerning the planning, development,\nnegotiation, and drawing of the 2011 Map.2  These documents can be broadly categorized as \n2 Plaintiffs’ document requests include:\n1.

Relevancy of Requested Documents\nUnder Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties may obtain discovery of\nany nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense.  Plaintiffs make six\nclaims related to the 2011 Map.  See Compl. ¶¶ 108–38.  Proof of discriminatory intent is\nrequired for plaintiffs to prevail on their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment racial\ndiscrimination claims.7  It has also been found sufficient, though not necessary, to sustain a VRA\nclaim.  See United States v. Irvin, 127 F.R.D. 169, 171 (C.D. Cal. 1989) (after the 1982\namendments to the VRA, “plaintiffs may carry their burden by fulfilling either the more\nrestrictive intent test or the results test”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); accord\nGarza v.

Ed. 2d 546 (2004).\n6\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::1 11:-1c1v--c0v5-006550 6D5o Dcuomcuemnte #n:t  9#0: -717  F Fileiledd: :1 100/2/142/1/111 P Paaggee 1 72 7o fo 2f 31 4P8a PgeaIgDe I#D:7 #1:4984\nTo demonstrate intentional discrimination, however, plaintiffs need not offer direct\nevidence of discriminatory intent.  Direct evidence includes statements made by the decision\nmaking body or members thereto.  See, e.g., ACORN  v. County of Nassau, No. 05-2301,\n2007 WL 2815810, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2007) (ACORN I) (“testimony regarding a\nlegislator’s stated motivation might be the most direct form of evidence” of discriminatory\nintent.)  Instead, plaintiffs may rely on circumstantial evidence to show that lawmakers\npurposefully discriminated against Latino and/or Republican voters in enacting the 2011 Map. \nSee Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1406 (7th Cir. 1984) (“In Rogers, the [Supreme] Court\naffirmed the district court’s finding of intentional discrimination based on indirect and\ncircumstantial evidence and endorsed its reliance on a ‘totality of the circumstances’ approach.”)\n(citing Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 622–27, 102 S. Ct. 3272, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (1982)).\nFor example, to evaluate claims of racial vote dilution under the Fourteenth Amendment,\ncourts rely on the totality of the circumstances test.  See Rogers, 458 U.S. at 618.  Under this\ntest, courts may infer discriminatory intent from a variety of circumstantial factors.  These\nfactors include, but are not limited to, bloc voting along racial lines; low minority voter\nregistration; exclusion from the political process; unresponsiveness of elected officials to needs\nof minorities; and depressed socio-economic status attributable to inferior education and\nemployment and housing discrimination.  Ketchum, 740 F.2d at 1406 (citing Rogers, 458 U.S. at\n622–27).  Other factors include the historical background of the decision; the specific sequence\nof events leading up to the challenged decision; departures from the normal procedural sequence;\nminority retrogression (i.e. a decrease in the voting strength of a cohesive voting bloc over time);\nand manipulation of district boundaries to adjust the relative size of minority groups, including\n7\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::1 11:-1c1v--c0v5-006550 6D5o Dcuomcuemnte #n:t  9#0: -717  F Fileiledd: :1 100/2/142/1/111 P Paaggee 1 82 8o fo 2f 31 4P8a PgeaIgDe I#D:7 #1:5985\nthe “packing” of minority voters.  See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 267–68, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977); Rybicki v. State Bd. of\nElections, 574 F. Supp. 1082, 1108–12 (N.D. Ill. 1982).  Thus, under the totality of the\ncircumstances test, the court may infer an “invidious discriminatory purpose . . . from the totality\nof the relevant facts,” including the discriminatory effect of the redistricting scheme.  Rogers,\n458 U.S. at 618 (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs allege many of these circumstantial factors in their Complaint.  See Compl. ¶¶\n38–45 (events leading up to enactment); ¶ 60 (history of discrimination); ¶¶ 52–54 (manipulating\ndistrict boundaries); ¶ 57 (racial polarization of elections).  Yet many of plaintiffs’ document\nrequests solicit direct, not circumstantial, evidence of legislative intent, by demanding\ndocuments that contain communications between lawmakers and their staff.  See, e.g., Req. Nos.\n1–5 & 8.  These documents are likely to contain the motives, impressions and/or opinions of\nthose responsible for drafting the 2011 Map.  Other requests seek the identities of those who\nmade or participated in key decisions, suggesting an attempt by plaintiffs to gain insight to the\nthought processes of these individuals, if not now, then perhaps later through depositions.  See,\ne.g., Req. Nos. 7, 9–13.   \nTo be sure, statements made by members of the decision-making body are relevant to\nshow discriminatory intent.  See Village of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268.  But this is but\none factor among many that plaintiffs may use to prove their claims.  As acknowledged by the\nSupreme Court, \nInquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a hazardous matter.  When the\nissue is simply the interpretation of legislation, the Court will look to statements by\nlegislators for guidance as to the purpose of the legislature, because the benefit to\nsound  decision-making  in  this  circumstance  is  thought  sufficient  to  risk  the\n8\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::1 11:-1c1v--c0v5-006550 6D5o Dcuomcuemnte #n:t  9#0: -717  F Fileiledd: :1 100/2/142/1/111 P Paaggee 1 92 9o fo 2f 31 4P8a PgeaIgDe I#D:7 #1:6986\npossibility of misreading Congress’ purpose.  It is entirely a different matter when\nwe are asked to void a statute that is, under well-settled criteria, constitutional on its\nface, on the basis of what fewer than a handful of Congressmen said about it. What\nmotivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what\nmotivates scores of others to enact it, and the stakes are sufficiently high for us to\neschew guesswork.\nHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 228, 105 S. Ct. 1916, 85 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985) (quoting\nUnited States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383–84, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 1682–1683, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672\n(1968)); see also Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 224, 91 S. Ct. 1940, 29 L. Ed. 2d 438\n(1971) (“no case in this Court has held that a legislative act may violate equal protection solely\nbecause of the motivations of the men who voted for it”); Hispanic Coalition on\nReapportionment v. Legislative Reapportionment Comm., 536 F. Supp 578, 586 (D. Pa. 1982)\n(holding that discriminatory statements made by the chairman of a city redistricting committee\nwere insufficient to prove discriminatory intent absent a showing that the state legislative body\nadopted the chairman’s views).  Thus, the individual motivations and objectives of those who\ndrafted the 2011 Map, although relevant, are not critical to the outcome of this case.\nThe remainder of plaintiffs’ document requests pertain to facts, plans, reports or\nprocedures created, formulated or used by lawmakers to draft the 2011 Map.  Objective facts,\nsuch as United States Census reports and election returns, are highly relevant to plaintiffs’ claims\nand necessary to prove many of the totality of the circumstances factors, including racial bloc\nvoting, retrogression and manipulation of district boundaries.  The actual facts upon which\nlawmakers relied, however, are less relevant because they say little as to whether the overall\neffect of the 2011 Map is discriminatory.  Lawmakers may have considered a lot of facts and\ndrawn a discriminatory map, or considered no facts and drawn a perfectly constitutional map. \nThe proof, so they say, is in the pudding; and the pudding is the 2011 Map. \n9\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11300 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#1:9787\nFinally, to the extent that the plans, reports and procedures used by lawmakers to draw\nthe 2011 Map shed light on the sequence of events leading up to its enactment, this information\nmay be relevant to plaintiffs’ claims.  The most important events, however, are those undertaken\nby the legislative body, such as public hearings, committee meetings and floor debates.  The\ndeliberations of individual lawmakers, even those who helped draw the 2011 Map, are less\nprobative of the totality of the circumstances test.  Nevertheless, because most of plaintiffs’\nrequests seek material relevant within Rule 26, the court will consider whether any of these\ndocuments are privileged from disclosure.    \nII. Identification of Nonprivileged Matter\nThe issue before this court is the extent to which legislative immunity shields non-party\nstate lawmakers from providing evidence in a civil lawsuit related to their legislative activities. \nPlaintiffs argue that the privilege is qualified and narrow.  Non-Parties argue that it is absolute.\nA.   Absolute Legislative Immunity\nThe Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution grants federal lawmakers\nabsolute legislative immunity from civil suit for their legitimate legislative activities. The Clause\nstates that “for any Speech or Debate in either House,” Senators and Representatives “shall not\nbe questioned in any other Place.”  U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 6, cl. 1.  When applied, this provision\nshields federal lawmakers “engaged in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity” from being\nsued for prospective relief or damages.  Supreme Ct. of Va. v. Consumers Union of U.S.,\n446 U.S. 719, 732, 100 S. Ct. 1967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1980) (quoting Tenney v. Branhove,\n341 U.S. 367, 376, 71 S. Ct. 783, 95 L. Ed. 1019 (1951)).  It also mandates an evidentiary\nprivilege that  prevents the legislative acts of a member of Congress from being used against him\n10\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11311 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#1:9888\nor her in court.  See United States v. Helstoski, 442 U.S. 477, 488–89, 99 S. Ct. 2432, 61 L. Ed.\n2d 12 (1979).  Finally, it provides a testimonial privilege that protects a member or the member’s\naides from judicial questioning regarding the member’s legislative acts.  Gravel v. United States,\n408 U.S. 606, 616, 92 S. Ct. 2614, 33 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1972).  “In sum, the Speech or Debate\nClause prohibits inquiry . . . into those things generally said or done in the House or the Senate\nin the performance of official duties and into the motivation for those acts.”  United States v.\nBrewster, 408 U.S. 501, 512, 92 S. Ct. 2531, 33 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1972).\nThe Speech or Debate Clause, by its terms, does not apply at all to state and local\nlegislators.  See, e.g., Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Fac., Inc. v. State of Fla. Dep’t of Health & Rehab.\nServs., 164 F.R.D. 257, 266 (N.D. Fla. 1995).  Instead, the federal common law applies.8 \nApplying the federal common law, the Supreme Court in Tenney held that members of a state\nlegislative committee were immune from civil liability for allegedly violating an individual’s\ncivil rights by calling him before the committee to testify in an effort to interfere with his First\nAmendment rights.  341 U.S. at 376–77.  Since Tenney, it is clear that under the federal common\nlaw “state and local officials are absolutely immune from federal suit for personal damages for\ntheir legitimate legislative activities.”  Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Blagojevich, 638 F.3d\n519, 527 (7th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted), partially vacated and decided on unrelated grounds\nby Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 651 F3d 799 (7th Cir. 2011); see\nalso Tenney, 341 U.S. at 376–77.  This immunity also extends to “legislative staff members,\nofficers, or other employees of a legislative body, although it is considered less absolute as\n8 This case presents federal questions and therefore the federal common law applies.  Fed. R.\nEvid. 501; see generally 3 WEINSTEIN’S EVIDENCE § 501.02[2][b][i] (1997) (in federal question cases,\nfederal privilege law, rather than the privilege law of the forum state, generally applies).\n11\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11322 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#1:9989\napplied to these individuals.” Marylanders for Fair Representation, Inc. v. Schaefer, 144 F.R.D.\n292, 298 (D. Md. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nThe scope of the federal common law is not entirely settled, however.  The Supreme\nCourt has held that in a federal criminal prosecution, a state legislator did not have an absolute\nevidentiary privilege based in legislative immunity from introduction of evidence of his\nlegislative acts.  United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 373, 100 S. Ct. 1185, 63 L. Ed. 2d 454\n(1980).  Gillock carved out an exception from Tenney, reasoning that “the cases in this court\nwhich have recognized an immunity from civil suit for state officials have presumed the\nexistence of federal criminal liability as a restraining factor on the conduct of state officials.” \n445 U.S. at 372.  See Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Fac., Inc, 164 F.R.D. at 267 (“legislators and some of\ntheir staff members may be immune to civil process in a suit directly against them . . . [but this\nimmunity] is not an evidentiary privilege”).  \nSince Gillock, a number of courts have “rejected the notion that the common law\nimmunity of state legislators gives rise to a general evidentiary privilege.”  Manzi v. DiCarlo,\n982 F. Supp. 125, 129 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (citations omitted); see Cano v. Davis, 193 F. Supp. 2d\n1177, 1180 (C.D. Cal. 2002) (“state legislators do not enjoy the type of absolute protection\nafforded members of the Congress under the Speech or Debate Clause”); In re Grand Jury,\n821 F.2d 946, 957 (3d Cir. 1987) (“Neither the threat of harassment, the dangers of distraction,\nnor the potential disruption of confidential communications justifies a qualified privilege for the\nfull range of legislative activities normally protected by the Speech or Debate Clause.”).\nThe issue before this court is whether common law legislative immunity absolutely\nshields non-party state lawmakers from providing evidence in a civil lawsuit related to their\n12\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11333 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9090\nlegislative activities.  Given the federal interests at stake in redistricting cases, this court\nconcludes that common law legislative immunity does not entirely shield Non-Parties here.  In\nGillock, the Supreme Court noted that “where important federal interests are at stake, such as in\nthe enforcement of federal criminal statutes, comity yields.”  445 U.S. at 373.  The federal\ngovernment’s interest in enforcing voting rights statutes is, without question, important.  See,\ne.g., Irvin, 127 F.R.D. at 174 (“The federal interest in the present case is compelling.  The\nVoting Rights Act forbids local practices that abridge the fundamental right to vote. This Act\nrequires vigorous and searching federal enforcement.”); Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, ----,\n129 S. Ct. 1231, 1240, 173 L. Ed. 2d 173 (2009) (“Passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was\nan important step in the struggle to end discriminatory treatment of minorities who seek to\nexercise one of the most fundamental rights of our citizens:  the right to vote.”).  Voting rights\ncases, although brought by private parties, seek to vindicate public rights.  In this respect, they\nare akin to criminal prosecutions.  Thus, much as in Gillock, “recognition of an evidentiary\nprivilege for state legislators for their legislative acts would impair the legitimate interest of the\nFederal government.”  Gillock, 445 U.S. at 373.  \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has stated that evidentiary privileges must be “strictly\nconstrued” and accepted “only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or\nexcluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle\nof utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.”  Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 50,\n100 S. Ct. 906, 63 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1980) (citation omitted).  This court therefore does not find in\nthe common law an absolute immunity for non-party state lawmakers that protects them from\n13\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11344 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9191\nproducing documents in federal redistricting cases.  Instead, Non-Parties’ privilege claims are\nbest analyzed under the doctrine of legislative privilege. \nB. Legislative Privilege\nOther courts in different contexts have applied a qualified legislative privilege to protect\nstate lawmakers from producing documents related to their legislative activities.  This privilege\nis similar to the deliberative process privilege, which is also qualified, but the deliberative\nprocess privilege applies to the executive branch, not the legislature.  The legislative privilege\ndoes not shield lawmakers from being sued, but rather protects them from producing documents\nin certain cases.  See Lindley v. Life Ins. Co. of Am., No. 08-CV-379, 2009 WL 2245565, at *9\n(N.D. Okla. Jul. 24, 2009) (“Generally, legislators’ immunity from suit is referred to as\n‘legislative immunity,’ and the evidentiary privilege accorded legislators is referred to as the\n‘legislative privilege.’”).  Under the federal common law, legislative privilege is qualified, not\nabsolute, and may be overcome by a showing of need.  In re Grand Jury, 821 F.2d at 958;\nJoseph’s House & Shelter, Inc. v. City of Troy, N.Y., 641 F. Supp. 2d 154, 158 n.3 (N.D.N.Y.\n2009).\nIn determining whether and to what extent a state lawmaker may invoke legislative\nprivilege, the court will consider the following factors: (i) the relevance of the evidence sought\nto be protected; (ii) the availability of other evidence; (iii) the seriousness of the litigation and\nthe issues involved; (iv) the role of the government in the litigation; and (v) the possibility of\nfuture timidity by government employees who will be forced to recognize that their secrets are\nviolable.  Rodriguez v. Pataki, 280 F. Supp. 2d 89, 101 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing In re Franklin\nNat’l Bank Secs. Litig., 478 F. Supp. 577, 583 (E.D.N.Y. 1979)); see also ACORN v.

Sept. 10, 2009) (ACORN II); Joseph’s\nHouse & Shelter, Inc, 641 F. Supp. 2d at 158 n.3.  In considering these factors, the court’s goal is\nto determine whether the need for disclosure and accurate fact finding outweighs the\nlegislature’s “need to act free of worry about inquiry into [its] deliberations.”  ACORN II, 2009\nWL 2923435, at *2 n.2.9\nC. Balancing of Interests\n1. The Seriousness of the Litigation and the Issues Involved, and the\nRole of the Government in the Litigation \nIn balancing the relevant interests, the first two factors weigh in favor of disclosure. \nThere can be little doubt that plaintiffs’ allegations are serious.  Plaintiffs raise profound\n9 These factors are also used by some courts to evaluate the availability and scope of the\ndeliberative process privilege.  See, e.g., Doe v. Nebraska, Nos. 8:09CV456, 4:09CV3266, 4:10CV3005,\n----F. Supp. 2d----, 2011 WL 1480483, at *7 (D. Neb. Apr. 19, 2011).  The deliberative process privilege\nprohibits discovery of communications that are used by governmental bodies in formulating policy. \nUnited States v. Farley, 11 F.3d 1385, 1389 (7th Cir. 1993).  The key difference between the deliberative\nprocess privilege and the legislative privilege is that the former protects executive and administrative\ndeliberations, and the latter safeguards legislative independence.  See Kay v. City of Rancho Palos\nVerdes, No. CV 02-3922, 2003 WL 25294710, at *15 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2003).  \nSome courts considering the scope of the deliberative process privilege have applied the same\nlegislative privilege factors discussed herein.  See, e.g, Doe, 2011 WL 1480483, at *7; Kay, 2003 WL\n25294710, at *18.  In this respect, “the balancing tests that courts have suggested for challenges to both\nthe legislative privilege and the deliberative process privilege are quite similar and functionally\ninterchangeable.”  Kay, 2003 WL 25294710, at *17 (collecting cases). \nSeveral cases in the Northern District of Illinois, however, have required a particularized showing\nto invoke the deliberative process privilege.  See, e.g., Buonauro v. City of Berwyn, No. 08-C-6687, 2011\nWL 2110133, at *2 (N.D. Ill. May 25, 2011) (“In order to invoke the privilege, a party must show three\nelements: (1) the department head with control over the information has made a formal claim of privilege;\n(2) the responsible official must demonstrate, usually by affidavit, the reasons for preserving the\nconfidentiality of the documents; and, (3) the official must specifically identify and describe the\ndocuments in question.”) (citing Ferrell v. U.S. Dep’t Hous. & Urban Dev., 177 F.R.D. 425, 428 (N.D.\nIll.1998)); see also Parvati Corp. v. City of Oak Forest, No. 08-C-702, 2010 WL 2836739, at *5 (N.D.\nIll. July 19, 2010).  \nBecause Non-Parties are members of the legislative branch, not the executive branch, and because\nthey have not made the particularized showing required to invoke the deliberative process privilege, the\ndeliberative process privilege does not apply.  This court will consider cases in other courts analyzing the\ndeliberative process privilege only to the extent that they bear on the scope of the legislative privilege.\n15\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11366 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9393\nquestions about the legitimacy of the redistricting process and the viability of the 2011 Map. \nMoreover, the legislators’ role in the allegedly unlawful conduct is direct.  The General\nAssembly, through its members, aides and consultants, was primarily responsible for drafting,\nrevising and approving the 2011 Map.  These actions are under scrutiny.  This is not, then, “the\nusual ‘deliberative process’ case in which a private party challenges governmental action . . . and\nthe government tries to prevent its decision-making process from being swept up unnecessarily\ninto [the] public [domain].”  United States v. Bd. of Ed. of City of Chicago, 610 F. Supp 695, 700\n(N.D. Ill. 1985).  Rather, “the decisionmaking process . . . [itself] is the case,” at least to the\nextent that plaintiffs allege that the General Assembly intentionally discriminated against Latino\nand/or Republican voters.  Id. (emphasis in original).  The seriousness of the litigation and the\nrole of Non-Parties militate in favor of disclosure. \n2. The Relevance of the Evidence Sought to be Protected and the\nAvailability of Other Evidence\nAs discussed in Part I.B. the evidence plaintiffs seek is relevant, although it is not central\nto the outcome of this case.  Moreover, the availability of other evidence favors non-disclosure. \nPlaintiffs already have considerable information at their fingertips.  This includes public hearing\nminutes, special interest group position papers, statements made by lawmakers during debate,\ncommittee reports, press releases, newspaper articles, census reports, registered voter data and\nelection returns.  These documents and data are a matter of public record.  As such, these factors\nweigh against disclosure. \n3. The Possibility of Future Timidity by Government Employees\nFinally, the need to encourage frank and honest discussion among lawmakers favors non-\ndisclosure.  Plaintiffs claim that disclosure of the subpoenaed documents will not unduly chill\n16\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11377 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9494\nlegislators in their future communications because Non-Parties are not defendants in the present\nlitigation and there is little danger that any discovered material would be used against them in a\nlater criminal prosecution.  Plaintiffs also claim that because this case involves redistricting—a\ntask not oft performed by legislators—permitting discovery will not work to chill the day-to-day\nfunctioning of the legislature.   \nThe Redistricting Act, however, evolved from the same legislative process as any other\nlaw.  Legislators negotiated the law in private and debated it in public.  Infrequency is therefore\nirrelevant.  In addition, the need for confidentiality between lawmakers and their staff is of\nutmost importance.  Legislators face competing demands from constituents, lobbyists, party\nleaders, special interest groups and others.  They must be able to confer with one another without\nfear of public disclosure. \nIn this respect, the legislature is not unlike other branches of government.  As noted by\nthe Third Circuit, a “legislator’s need for confidentiality is similar to the need for confidentiality\nin communications between judges, between executive officials, and between a President and his\naides.”  In re Grand Jury, 821 F.2d at 957 (citations omitted); see also Certain Complaints\nUnder Investigation by an Investigating Comm. of the Judicial Council of the Eleventh Circuit,\n783 F.2d 1488, 1520 (11th Cir. 1986) (judicial privilege applies where matters under inquiry\nimplicate communications among a judge and his staff concerning official judicial business such\nas “the framing and researching of opinions, orders and rulings”); N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck &\nCo., 421 U.S. 132, 150, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 44 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975) (executive privilege for agency\nofficials applies to documents “reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations\n17\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11388 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9595\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated”)\n(citation omitted).  \nFailure to protect confidential communications between lawmakers and their staff will\nnot only chill legislative debate, it will also discourage “earnest discussion within governmental\nwalls.”  Doe, 2011 WL 1480483, at *6 (citations omitted).  In the redistricting context, full\npublic disclosure would hinder the ability of party leaders to synthesize competing interests of\nconstituents, special interest groups and lawmakers, and draw a map that has enough support to\nbecome law.  This type of legislative horse trading is an important and undeniable part of the\nlegislative process.    \nCourts have recognized that disclosure of confidential documents concerning intimate\nlegislative activities should be avoided.  See Rodriguez, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 102; Kay, 2003 WL\n25294710, at *14.  Courts applying this approach have held that a qualified privilege protects\ndocuments “created prior to the passage and implementation [of a bill] that involve opinions,\nrecommendations or advice about legislative decisions between legislators or between legislators\nand their aides.”  Doe, 2011 WL 1480483, at *8; see generally City of Las Vegas v. Foley,\n747 F.2d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir. 1984) (“The Court prevents inquiry into the motives of legislators\nbecause it recognizes that such inquiries are a hazardous task.”) (citations omitted). \nBy limiting privileged documents to those that contain “opinions, recommendations or\nadvice,” courts have allowed discovery of “documents containing factually based information\nused in the decision-making process or disseminated to legislators or committees, such as\ncommittee reports and minutes of meetings.”  Id. at *6 (citations omitted).  Courts have also\nrequired disclosure of “the materials and information available [to lawmakers] at the time a\n18\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  11399 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9696\ndecision was made.” ACORN I, 2007 WL 2815810, at *4 (citing Village of Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. at n.20).   \nThis approach strikes the proper balance between the need for public accountability and\nthe desire to avoid future timidity of lawmakers.  Although always accountable to the public,\nlawmakers must be able to confer in private.  This court therefore concludes that the legislative\nprivilege shields from disclosure pre-decisional, non-factual communications that contain\nopinions, recommendations or advice about public policies or possible legislation.  It does not  \nprotect facts or information available to lawmakers at the time of their decision.  \nIn terms of the categories identified above, (1) information concerning the motives,\nobjectives, plans, reports and/or procedures used by lawmakers to draw the 2011 Map; and (2)\ninformation concerning the identities of persons who participated in decisions regarding the 2011\nMap, the need for the information is outweighed by the purposes of the qualified privilege.  The\ncontrary is true of (3) the identities of experts and/or consultants retained to assist in drafting the\n2011 Map and contractual agreements related thereto; and (4) objective facts upon which\nlawmakers relied in drawing the 2011 Map.  Indeed, much of this information is discoverable\nunder Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(ii) should defendants’ experts chose to rely on it.\nD. Waiver\nAs with any privilege, the legislative privilege can be waived when the parties holding\nthe privilege share their communications with an outsider.  See ACORN I, 2007 WL 2815810, at\n*4 (“the legislative privilege may be waived as to communications made in the presence of third\nparties”) (citation omitted).  “Where a legislative aide or staff member performs functions that\n19\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  12400 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9797\nwould be deemed legislative if performed by the legislator himself, the staff member is entitled\nto the same privilege that would be available to the legislator.”  Id. (citation omitted).   Thus,\ncommunications between Non-Parties and their staff retain their privileged status.  See id. at *5.\nCommunications between Non-Parties and outsiders to the legislative process, however,\ndo not.  This includes lobbyists, members of Congress and the Democratic Congressional\nCampaign Committee (“DCCC”).  Although these groups may have a heightened interest in the\noutcome of the redistricting process, they could not vote for or against the Redistricting Act, nor\ndid they work for someone who could.  As such, the legislative privilege does not apply.  See\nRodriguez, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 101 (“a conversation between legislators and knowledgeable\noutsiders, such as lobbyists, to mark up legislation [is] a session for which no one could seriously\nclaim privilege”).  \nThe same rule applies to experts and/or consultants retained or utilized by Non-Parties to\nassist in the redistricting process.  “While legislators are certainly free to seek information from\noutside sources, they may not assume that every such contact is forever shielded from view. . . .\n[A] contrary ruling would allow a legislator to cloak any communication with legislative\nprivilege by simply retaining an outsider in some capacity.”  ACORN I, 2007 WL 2815810, at\n*6.  Thus, to the extent that Non-Parties relied on reports or recommendations generated by\noutside consultants to draft the 2011 Map, they waived their legislative privilege as to these\ndocuments. \nFinally, Non-Parties cannot invoke the privilege as to themselves yet allow others to use\nthe same information against plaintiffs at trial.  See, e.g., Brown v. City of Detroit, 259 F. Supp.\n2d 611, 623–24 (E.D. Mich. 2003); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Lynch, No. C-01-3023, 2002 WL\n20\n\nCaCsaes: e1:: 111:1-1cv-c-0v-50056056 D5 oDcoucmuemnet n#t:  #9:0 7-71   FFilieledd::  1100//2142//1111  PPaaggee  12411 o of f2 134 P8 aPgaegIDeI D#: 7#2:9898\n32812098, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2002).  As such, any communications disclosed by Non-\nParties to defendants or their trial experts, upon which defendants or their experts intend to rely,\nmust be disclosed to plaintiffs.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(ii).10      \nORDER \nPlaintiffs’ motion to compel enforcement of third party subpoena [Dkt. No. 52] and\ncertain non-parties’ motion to quash subpoenas and for a protective order [Dkt. No. 58] are\ngranted in part and denied in part, respectively. Non-parties are directed to comply with this\norder by October 19, 2011, specifically as follows: \nTo the extent that plaintiffs seek documents containing the (1) motives, objectives, plans,\nreports and/or procedures created, formulated or used by lawmakers to draw the 2011 Map prior\nto the passage of the Redistricting Act;11 or (2) identities of persons who participated in decisions\nregarding the 2011 Map,12 their requests are denied and the subpoenas are quashed.  Plaintiffs\nare also prohibited from subpoenaing the aforementioned documents from individual members\nof the General Assembly unless the member affirmatively waives his or her legislative privilege\nin writing.\n10 Non-Parties indicated that to the extent the legislative privilege did not shield them from\ndiscovery, they would likely assert attorney-client privilege or work product immunity.  This decision\naddresses only the legislative privilege raised in the motions.  If Non-Parties have a serious basis for\nasserting any other privilege, this decision does not foreclose them.\n11 See Req. Nos. 1– 6, 8, 14–17. [Doc. No. 52-1.]\n12 See Req. Nos. 7, 9–11, 20–21.

These documents were not disclosed in a \ntimely fashion and constitute hearsay that does not fall into any exception or exemption.   In \naddition, some of the exhibits appear to be offered to support conclusions that require expert \nanalysis and opinion even though these documents were not offered by or relied on by any expert \nin this matter.   Furthermore, these documents are irrelevant, immaterial, and their probative \nvalue is outweighed by the prejudicial effect on Defendants.  As such, these exhibits should be \nbarred from use at the hearing in this case and should be stricken from Plaintiffs’ Memorandum \nin  Support  of  Their  Motion  for  Permanent  Injunction  (“Injunction  Memorandum”  or  “Inj. \nMemo.”).  \n1  \n\n  \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 117 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:2352\nPlaintiffs’ Proposed Exhibits\nIn  the  Proposed  Pre-Trial  Order,  Plaintiffs  identify,  inter  alia,  Plaintiffs’  Proposed \nExhibits P-42 (A52), P-44 (A54), P-51 (A61), P-52 (A62), P-53 (A63), P-54 (A64), P-55 (A65), \nP-56 (A66), P-57 (A67), P-58 (A68), and P-109 as possible exhibits for trial.   Additionally, \nexcept  for  P-109,  these  documents  are  attached  to  and  used  in  Plaintiffs’  Injunction \nMemorandum.

In their Injunction Memorandum, Plaintiffs utilize these documents to \nsupport  the totality-of-the-circumstances  analysis  of intentional  vote dilution  under  Count  I \n(Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act), Count II (Equal Protection), and Count III (Fifteenth \nAmendment).  Inj. Memo. at 2, 23, 32, and 27-8.  These documents should be barred from use as \nsupport for the Plaintiffs’ motion or during testimony at the hearing because they are hearsay, \nwere untimely disclosed to Defendants, were not relied upon by Plaintiffs’ disclosed experts, and \nare not relevant to the matter at hand. \nFirst, these documents are hearsay and fall into no exception or exemption, and thus must \nbe barred from introduction at the hearing as well as from any use in this case.  Hearsay is a \n“statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered \nin evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.”  Stillwater of Crown Point Homeowner’s \nAss’n, Inc. v. Kovich, __ F.Supp. 2d __, 2011 WL 4818511 (N.D. Ind.), quoting FRE 801; see \nalso U.S. v. Albiola, 624 F.3d 431, 440 (7th Cir. 2010).  While Plaintiffs may argue that these \ndocuments qualify for an exception under FRE 803(18) (Learned Treatises), such exception only \napplies to expert usage. As explained below, there is no indication these documents are being \nproffered  for  use  with  Plaintiffs’  experts  because  neither  of  Plaintiffs’  experts  considered, \nanalyzed, or opined upon such issues or considered such documents at any point during this case.   \nSecond, these documents were not timely disclosed to Defendants in this litigation. They \nwere produced between October 19th and 26th, 2011.  They were produced on or after the last \nday for fact discovery (October 19, 2011 was the last day for fact discovery depositions) and \n3  \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 117 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:2354\nwell after Plaintiffs’ expert disclosures were due – initial reports on September 14, 2011 and \nrebuttal reports on October 18, 2011.  See Discovery and Preliminary Pre-Trial No. 1, 8/11/11; \nAgreed Order, 9/29/11.  No indication exists that these documents were unavailable to Plaintiffs \nprior to those dates.  Defendants would be prejudiced by their admission because neither they nor \ntheir experts have had the time to review and comment on these materials.   \nThird, Plaintiffs’ expert disclosures – four reports between September 14, 2011 and \nOctober 19, 2011 – made no mention of or citation to these documents or any of the facts, data, \nissues, or opinions contained in these documents.  Plaintiffs’ experts during their depositions on \nOctober  21st  (Dr.  Peter  Morrsion)  and  October  25th  (Dr.  Richard  Engstrom)  provided  no \ntestimony about these documents or any of the facts, data, issues, or opinions contained therein.  \nMore significantly, Plaintiffs’ experts have never provided any facts, data, analysis, or opinions \non  the  socio-economic  factor  of  the  totality-of-the-circumstances  test  at  any  point  in  their \ndisclosures or deposition testimony.  Likewise, Plaintiffs’ experts have not provided an overall \nanalysis of the totality-of-the-circumstances test despite the fact that Defendants’ expert, Dr. \nAllan Lichtman, provided substantial analysis of this test in his October 4, 2011 report, well \nbefore  Plaintiffs’  experts’  rebuttal  reports  were  due  and  depositions  were  taken.   These \ndocuments have never been a part of Plaintiffs’ experts’ opinions and should not be permitted \ninto evidence at this time.  \nFinally, these documents by themselves have no probative value and are, therefore, not \nrelevant in this matter.  While relevance is broadly defined, evidence is relevant if it has “any \ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the \naction more probable or less probable….”  FRE 401; see also U.S. v. McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, \n711 (7th Cir. 2011); Hicks v. State, 690 N.E.2d 215, 220 (Ind. 1997).  Plaintiffs attempt to use \n4  \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 117 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:2355\nthese exhibits to bolster, by way of legal argument, the totality-of-the-circumstances test.  See \nInj. Memo, at 26-28.  However, in order to be relevant to the totality-of-the-circumstances test, \nthe information about socio-economic conditions of a minority group must be connected to an \neffect on electoral opportunities and political participation.   League of United Latin American \nCitizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 426 (2006) (discussing “the extent to which minority group \nmembers bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and \nhealth, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process” as a factor \nrelevant  to  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  analysis)  (emphasis  added).   None  of  these \ndocuments make such connections or draw such conclusions in isolation or in combination.  The \nconnection of the facts, data, and conclusions in these reports to electoral opportunities and \npolitical  participation  is  the  proper  province  of  an  expert,  who  can  use  his/her  “scientific, \ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge…[to] assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence \nor to determine a fact in issue….”  FRE 702.  Only an individual qualified as an expert by his/her \nknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education can testify or opine on these subjects.  See \nFRE 702.  See also Ammons v. Aramark Unif. Servs., 368 F.3d 809, 816 (7th Cir. 2004); Ancho v. \nPentek Corp., 157 F.3d 512, 515, 519 (7th Cir. 1998).  To the extent that these articles are being \noffered as a basis for an opinion on the totality-of-the-circumstances test without the analysis of \nan expert, they must be barred from use in this case.   \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Exhibits P-42, P-51 through P52, and P-54 through P-58 \nshould be barred as untimely, hearsay, and irrelevant materials, the probative value of which is \noutweighed by the prejudicial result to Defendants. \n5  \n\n  \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 117 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:2356\nOther Proposed Exhibits\nDefendants object to several other exhibits offered by Plaintiffs in their Memorandum in \nSupport of Their Motion for a Permanent Injunction and for use at the hearing.  First, Proposed \nPlaintiffs’ Exhibit P-56 is a Chicago Tribune Web article, which has been cited for the premise \nthat  “top  Democrats”  stated  that  the  map  resulted  from  “the  most  transparent,  the  most \naccountable, the most open redistricting process in the history of the state of Illinois.”   Inj. \nMemo. at 2.   This brief quotation is from a newspaper article quoting a non-party to this \nlitigation.   Therefore, the document is hearsay, and no exemption or exception applies.   A \ncomment by one member of the legislature regarding the redistricting process, contained within \nan article along with many other comments is irrelevant, and its prejudicial value outweighs the \nprobative value.   \nAlso, Proposed Plaintiff Exhibit P-57 is cited in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of \nPermanent Injunction only for the facts about when the map was disclosed publicly (May 27, \n2011), when voting on the map occurred, and what the vote results were.  Inj. Memo. at 32. This \nbasic date is available from other, more official sources.  Furthermore, the document containing \nthis bit of otherwise-available information is buried in a 26 page print-out of a Web site listing \npersonal opinions contained in 107 blog comments from various unidentified sources.  Thus, this \ndocument  is  irrelevant,  hearsay,  and  any  probative  value  is  outweighed  by  prejudice  to \nDefendants.  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Exhibit P-58 is a press release from an advocacy group in \n2008 regarding opinions about U.S. Representative Bill Lipinski.  This is hearsay without any \nexception or exemption.  On its own, it has no probative value as to any of the issues in this case \nand should be barred from use or introduction into evidence in this case.  \n6  \n\n  \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 117 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 7 of 8 PageID #:2357\nMoreover,  Plaintiffs’  Proposed  Exhibit  P-109  was  first  disclosed  to  Defendants  on \nNovember 7, 2010 in the context of the Proposed Pre-Trial Order.  This document purports to be \na chart of various election results and demographic data for districts of various Latino U.S. \nCongressmen.  The source for this data is The Almanac of American Politics.  Data regarding the \nelection  results  for  U.S.  Representative  Luis  Gutierrez  and  demographics  for  Illinois \nCongressional  District  4  were  referenced  in  this  litigation;  however,  he  is  only  one  of  22 \nrepresentatives listed on this table.  Thus, except for that discrete piece of data, none of the other \nfacts or data contained in this document were disclosed, utilized, or referenced in this litigation. \nAs  such,  it is  unclear as  to  how this  document  would  or could  be used  in  this litigation.  \nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Exhibit P-109 should be barred from use in this case on hearsay, \nfoundation and relevance grounds.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Exhibits P-44 and P-53 are also the subject of another \nMotion  in  Limine  filed  by  Defendants.   For  reasons  stated  in  that  Motion  in  Limine,  and \nadditionally because these documents are hearsay, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Exhibit P-44 and P-53 \nshould be barred from use in this case and stricken from Plaintiffs’ Injunction Memorandum.   \nConclusion \nFor the reason set forth above, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Exhibits P-42 (A52), P-44 (A54), P-\n51 (A61), P-52 (A62), P-53 (A63), P-54 (A64), P-55 (A65), P-56 (A66), P-57 (A67), P-58 \n(A68), and P-109 should be barred from use at trial and stricken from Plaintiffs’ Injunction \nMemorandum, and all testimony regarding these documents should be barred in this case.   \n7  \n\n      \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 117 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 8 of 8 PageID #:2358\nDated:  November 10, 2011   Respectfully submitted, \nTHE ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.          \n                    /s/ Brent Stratton    \n                Attorney for Defendants                           \nBrent D.

Doc. 113; see Doc. 105 at 36-\n37 & n.13, 42-43 (permanent injunction motion); Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 75 & n.10, 134, 142 (amended\ncomplaint). As Defendants note, PVI “measure[s] to what extent a district leans towards one\npolitical party or the other.” Doc. 113 at 4. Widely used and reported, PVI rests on a simple\ncalculation: it compares the average of how an area voted in the last two presidential elections to\nthe nation’s average, based on publicly available elections returns. Doc. 105 at 36 n.13. In\nPlaintiffs’ proposed standard for adjudicating partisan gerrymander claims, PVI supplies an\nobjectivebaselineagainstwhichtomeasurethepartisaneffectof aredistricting.\nDefendants’ motion in limine rests on two incorrect arguments: (1) that reporting PVI\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 135 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 2 of 43 PageID #:3055\nresults calls for “essentially expert testimony” (Doc. 113 at 3); and (2) that Plaintiffs’ use of\nPVI—a mere three days after this Court required Plaintiffs to propose their own standard for\njudging partisan gerrymander claims and two weeks before trial—is untimely. The Court should\ndenyDefendants’motioninlimine.\nARGUMENT\nI. TheReporting OfPVIResultsIsNotExpertTestimony.\nAsDefendants’ lawyers musthaverecognizedwhentheythemselves reportedPVIresults\nin their recent motion to dismiss (Doc. 122 at 8-9), the reporting of PVI results does not require\n“expert” testimony. Indeed, Defendants’ motion in limine repeatedly acknowledges this point.\nThe motion notes (at 4) that Plaintiffs are presenting PVI results through Edward Marshall, who\nis “simply adopt[ing] another person’s methodology to publish calculations.” It consistently\nhedges when using the word “expert,” claiming for example that the reporting of PVI results is\n“effectively attempting to present expert testimony.” Motion at 2 (emphasis added); accord id. at\n3 (“essentially expert testimony”) (emphasis added). And Defendants recognize (at 4) the\ndistinction between expert opinions on the one hand and “analytic maps construed as factual\ndata”ontheother.\nThe allegedly objectionable material—portions of Marshall’s affidavit discussing PVI\nand PVI figures, cartographic representations of PVI results, and PVI references in the motion\nfor a permanent injunction—clearly fall under the category of “factual data,” not expert\n“opinions.” See Doc. 113 at 3. To begin with, none of the documents offer any “opinions”\nwhatsoever. Marshall is simply reporting readily calculable PVI results based on publicly\navailable elections returns and portraying those results visually. He is not opining on the\nreliability of PVI as a metric, as Defendants recognize (at 4). Moreover, courts routinely take\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 135 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 3 of 43 PageID #:3056\njudicial notice of the only information that Marshall uses—the results of public elections.1\nMarshall thus offers nothing close to the testimony in the cases that Defendants cite, which\ninvolve drug-trade code words, alternative product designs, and Japanese consumer attitudes\ntoward licensed trademarks. See United States v. York, 572 F.3d 415 (7th Cir. 2009); Ancho v.\nPentek Corp., 157 F.3d 512 (7th Cir. 1998); Sunstar, Inc. v. Alberto-Culver Co., 2006 WL\n6505615 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 16, 2006). Instead, his testimony is similar to that in Deslauriers v.\nChertoff, 2008 WL 5428161, at *3 (D. Me. Dec. 31, 2008), which permitted the testimony of a\n“fact witness [who had] personal knowledge gleaned from a review of the Department’s\npersonneldataandherpreparationoftables thatsummarizethedata.”2\nMoreover, Defendants offer absolutely no basis to strike “the Cook Political Report and\nthe Almanac for American Politics’ definition of the Cook Partisan Voting Index.” See Doc. 113\nat5. Defendants do notdisputetheauthenticityof thosedocuments, and even the SupremeCourt\n1 See, e.g., Green Party of Ark. v. Martin, 649 F.3d 675, 679 (8th Cir. 2011); Dudum v. Arntz,\n640 F.3d 1098, 1102 n.6 (9th Cir. 2011); Schaffer v. Clinton, 240 F.3d 878, 885 n.8 (10th Cir.\n2001).\n2 Defendants’ suggestion (at 2-3 & n.1) that Plaintiffs hid Marshall is quite simply false.\nDefendants knew about Marshall the minute that Plaintiffs identified him as a potential fact\nwitness in theirinterrogatoryresponseon September 19, 2011. SeeExhibitA. Then, Defendants’\ncounsel sent a letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel stating that they “assum[ed]” that Marshall had no\nrelevant knowledge and asked Plaintiffs’ counsel to inform them “immediately” if Plaintiffs\nintended to call Marshall at trial. See Exhibit B. The parties next held a telephonic meet and\nconfer conference on September 26, 2011, in which Plaintiffs’ counsel specifically described\nwhat role Marshall played in Plaintiffs’ case. The following day, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a letter\nto Defendants’ counsel informing them that Plaintiffs had not decided which witnesses to call at\ntrial, as discovery was ongoing. See Exhibit C. Thus, Defendants knew for weeks about what\nrole Marshall could play in Plaintiffs’ case. Moreover, while Defendants initially challenged the\nentiretyof Marshall’s affidavit and testimony, they now have stipulated to all exhibits created by\nMarshall except for PVI, showing that they have little problem with the use of Marshall as a\nwitness.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 135 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 4 of 43 PageID #:3057\nrelies onthesesourcesin electionlawcases.3\nII. TheReporting OfPVIResultsWasNotUntimely.\nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ use of PVI was untimely. But Defendants must\nhaveforgottenthesequenceof eventsthatled PlaintiffstousePVI. Defendants movedtodismiss\nPlaintiffs’ original complaint not because its partisan gerrymandering claims were factually\ndeficient but instead because the complaint did not propose a legal standard. Like the eight Vieth\nJustices aside from Justice Kennedy, Plaintiffs argued that the Court should fashion the standard\nfor determining the constitutionality of (justiciable) political gerrymander claims. See Vieth v.\nJubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 301 (2004) (four-Justice plurality stating “it is our job, not the\nplaintiffs’, to explicate the standard that makes the facts alleged by the plaintiffs adequate or\ninadequate to state a claim”); id. at 317 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (proposing standard); id. at 342\n(Souter, J., dissenting) (same); id. at 355 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (same); Doc. 67 at 10\n(Plaintiffs’ opposition to motion to dismiss). This Court agreed with Plaintiffs that “[g]enerally\n... a complaint needn’t plead a legal theory” (Doc. 98 at 18), but agreed with Defendants that\npartisan gerrymandering claims require Plaintiffs to propose a reliable standard in their\ncomplaint. Thus, on November 1, 2011, this Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander\nclaimsand gavePlaintiffs six daystopropose astandard.Id. at22.\nSo as to not blindside Defendants, merely three days later, Plaintiffs filed their amended\ncomplaint and motion for a permanent injunction, both of which proffered a standard using PVI.\nWhile Defendants claim (at 4) that these filings occurred “on the eve of trial,” Defendants had\n3 E.g., League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 410-11, 439 (2006) (citing\nAlmanac); Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74, 80 (1997) (same); Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 965,\n973 (1996) (plurality opinion) (same); id. at 1041 n.37 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (same); Miller v.\nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 909 (1995) (same); see also Cao v. FEC, 688 F. Supp. 2d 498, 521-22\n(E.D. La.2010) (citingtheCookPoliticalReport).\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 135 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 5 of 43 PageID #:3058\nnearly two weeks before trial started. Given the expedited nature of this case, 13 days is a\ngenerous period for a response. See United States v. Salerno, 108 F. 3d 730 (7th Cir. 1997)\n(affirming decision to permit jury to view scale model created by government’s expert when the\n“defendant had at least two weeks”to inspect the model and “alter his trial strategy” if needed).\nIndeed, that time period is longer than the time it took Defendants to write a 42-page brief in\nopposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for a permanent injunction and far longer than the time it took\nDefendants’ expert to write a 20-page sur-reply to the rebuttal reports of Plaintiffs’ experts. See\nDoc. 128 (opposition to permanent injunction motion); Response of Allan J. Lichtman to\nRebuttal Reports of Richard J. Engstrom and Peter A. Morrison (Oct. 27, 2011) (responding to\nEngstrom’sReportofOct.19,2011andMorrison’sReportofOct.18,2011).\nDefendants’ suggestion that their expert will not have the opportunity to “rebut”\nPlaintiffs’ political gerrymander claims is nonsense for another reason. Defendants have known\nfrom the start of this case that Plaintiffs raise partisan gerrymander claims. See Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 1, 4-\n6, 37-46, 69-101, 129-137. Indeed, Defendants (and their expert) have argued that the\nredistricted map is lawful precisely because it was politically gerrymandered. See Doc. 40 at 14\n(“The Complaint provides this Court with ample allegations that, accepted as true, establish it\nwas political considerations, not race, which dictated the shape of the statewide map.”);\nLichtman Dep. at 212-13 (opining that Rep. Biggert was placed into Rep. Quigley’s district for\n“political reasons” “to enhance the abilityof Democrats to get elected and probably diminish the\nabilityof Republicans to do so”). If Defendants find themselves in a bind now, it is onlybecause\nthey pinned their defense on the hope that Plaintiffs would be unable to propose a reliable\nstandard.Defendantscannotcryfoulfortheirown trialstrategy.\nFinally,Defendants’argument(at5)that Plaintiffshave “cherrypick[ed]alimitedareain\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 135 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 6 of 43 PageID #:3059\nIllinois”intheirPVImapsis absurd.ThemapsportrayPVIinthefulldistricts andthetownsthat\nPlaintiffs have alleged are politically gerrymandered. See Doc. 103 at ¶¶5, 77, 83-84, 131, 133-\n134, 139, 141-142; Doc. 105 at 31-37, Add. 37-38, 41-48, 51-56. As discovery has revealed,\nthese are exactly the districts and towns that the DCCC and state mapmakers tried to\ngerrymander. See Doc. 106 at Exs. A22, A31. If Defendants think that other PVI maps would\nsomehowberelevant,theyarefreetotrytointroducethosemaps themselves.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully ask that the Court deny Defendants’\nMotionin Limine#1(Doc.113).\nDated: November15,2011 RespectfullySubmitted,\n/s/ LoriE.

For the following reasons, these claims should be dismissed pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiffs’ original Complaint contained two counts alleging an unconstitutional \npartisan  gerrymander  in  violation  of  the  14th  Amendment  (Count  VI)  and  the  First \nAmendment (Count V).  This Court’s November 1, 2011 Opinion and Order dismissed \nboth.  In its Opinion, this Court concluded “[t]he Committee’s Fourteenth Amendment \npartisan gerrymandering claim must be dismissed because, with no workable standard yet \nin existence, the court can’t say that its allegations give rise to a plausible claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted.” DE#98; Court’s November 1, 2011 Opinion and Order \n(“Memo. Op.”), p. 19.  Recognizing that the Supreme Court has rejected every proposed \nstandard, this Court noted that, “[w]e surmise that amendment might be futile in light of \ntoday’s understanding of the law under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id.  Nevertheless, \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:2484\nthe Court provided the Committee an opportunity “to amend its complaint in an effort to \narticulate a workable and reliable standard for adjudicating their partisan gerrymandering \nclaim and sufficient factual allegations to demonstrate plausibility.”  Id. at 20. \n  In addressing the First Amendment claim contained in Count V, on the other \nhand, this Court found that the “complaint falls to a different obstacle.”  Id.  In dismissing \nCount V, this Court found that “[t]he Committee’s complaint doesn’t make plausible a \nfinding that the 2011 Map infringes Republican voters’ rights to associate with each other \nor with anyone else, or a finding that the 2011 Map burdens Republican voters’ rights of \nfree expression, or that the 2011 Map affects Republican voters’ rights to petition the \ngovernment.” Id. at 21.  The Court rejected Plaintiff’s allegations that the Redistricting \nPlan “will make it more difficult for Republican voters to elect Republican candidates” \nbecause “that doesn’t implicate a First Amendment right.” Id.  This Court’s discussion of \nCount V did not include a similar invitation to amend. \nUndeterred,  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  contains  both  a  Fourteenth \nAmendment claim (Count VI) and a First Amendment claim (Count V).  Both of these \namended partisan gerrymandering claims should be dismissed because, like their first \nfailed effort, Plaintiffs do not articulate any “workable and reliable standard” for judging \nan unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  Having failed to articulate a “workable and \nreliable standard,” Defendants and the Court therefore are left with no way to assess \nwhether Plaintiffs’ allegations are “plausible.”  \n  Count VI, under the Fourteenth Amendment, should  be dismissed because  it \nsimply restates proposed bases for partisan gerrymander claims that have already been \nexpressly rejected by the Supreme Court.  Count V, under the First Amendment, should \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:2485\nbe  dismissed  for  two  reasons.    First,  while  this  Court’s  November  1,  2011  Order \npermitted an amendment to the Complaint regarding the 14th Amendment claims, it is \nless clear an amended First Amendment claim would be countenanced.  Id. at 20-22.  \nSecond, Count V articulates verbatim the same standard as Count VI and, thus, should be \ndismissed for the same reasons. \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  The Partisan Gerrymander Claim under the Equal Protection Clause \nin  Count  VI  Should  Be  Dismissed  Because  Plaintiffs’  Proposed \nStandard has been Considered and Rejected by the Supreme Court. \n \n  Pursuant  to  this  Court’s  November  1,  2011  Order,  Plaintiffs  amended  their \nComplaint to include a proposed standard for measuring partisan gerrymandering claims.  \nGoing beyond the Court’s Order, however, the Amended Complaint also changes the \ndistricts that Plaintiffs claim were politically  gerrymandered.  The  initial Complaint \nalleged that Districts 3, 11, and 13 were politically gerrymandered, but the Amended \nComplaint drops the challenge to District 3 and adds a new challenge to District 17. \nAmend. Comp. ¶139.  Needless to say, bringing a new challenge to a new district the \nweek before trial, after the close of discovery, and after all of the experts have submitted \ntheir reports and have been deposed, is unfair and prejudicial.  \n  Regardless  of  which  districts  are  challenged,  however,  Plaintiffs’  proposed \nstandard is neither “workable” nor “reliable” and has been rejected by the Supreme \nCourt.  First, Plaintiffs’ proposed standard purports to have “an intent requirement and an \neffect  requirement.”    Amend.  Comp.,  ¶  140.    This  two-pronged  (intent  and  effect) \nstandard is essentially the same as the one proposed twenty-five years ago in Davis v. \nBandemer, 478 U.S. 109, 133 (1986), measuring plaintiffs’ “direct or indirect influence \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:2486\non the elections of the state legislature as a whole.”  The proposed standard was expressly \nrejected by the Supreme Court in Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 283-284 (2004) (“this \nstandard  was  misguided  when  proposed,  has  not  been  improved  in  subsequent \napplication, and is not even defended before us today by the appellants, we decline to \naffirm it as a constitutional requirement.”). \n  Plaintiffs argue that the first element of their purported standard—intent—can be \nshown by “direct or circumstantial proof that the State’s mapmakers created one or more \ncongressional  districts  with  the  predominant  intent  to  secure  partisan  advantage.”  \nAmend. Comp., ¶ 141 (emphasis added).  However, in Vieth, the Supreme Court flatly \nrejected a proposed “predominant intent” standard that was worded essentially the same \nway as the one proposed here.  Vieth, 541 U.S. at 284 (proposed “intent standard” would \nrequire plaintiff to “‘show that the mapmakers acted with a predominant intent to achieve \npartisan  advantage,’  which  can  be  shown  ‘by  direct  evidence  or  by  circumstantial \nevidence that other neutral and legitimate redistricting criteria were subordinated to the \ngoal of achieving partisan advantage.’”).  The Court rejected this proposed standard \nbecause: \nVague as the “predominant motivation” test might be when \nused to evaluate single districts,  it all  but evaporates when \napplied  statewide.  Does  it  mean,  for  instance,  that  partisan \nintent must outweigh all other goals—contiguity, compactness, \npreservation of neighborhoods, etc.— statewide? And how is \nthe statewide “outweighing” to be determined? \n \nId. at 285 (emphasis in original).  Moreover, not only has the Supreme Court expressly \nrejected Plaintiffs’ proposed “predominant intent” standard, it has even gone so far as to \nreject a proposed “sole motivation” standard.  League of United Latin American Citizens \nv. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 418-420 (2006) (“LULAC”) (“a successful claim attempting to \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:2487\nidentify unconstitutional acts of partisan gerrymandering must do what appellants’ sole-\nmotivation theory explicitly disavows: show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, \non the complainants’ representational rights.”).  In LULAC, the Court rejected the sole \nmotivation  standard:    “The  [Texas  state]  legislature  does  seem  to  have  decided  to \nredistrict with the sole purpose of achieving a Republican congressional majority, but \npartisan aims did not guide every line it drew.” Id. at 417. \n  The  Vieth  Court  not  only  rejected  the  “predominant  intent”  standard  for \nmeasuring a statewide redistricting plan, but also as applied to individual districts.  Vieth, \n541  U.S.  at  285  (because  “political  entities”  are  responsible  for  redistricting, \n“unsurprisingly that turns out to be root-and-branch a matter of politics”).  The Supreme \nCourt  rejected  a  comparison  to  racial  gerrymandering  because,  unlike  racial \ngerrymandering claims, “the fact that partisan districting is a lawful and common practice \nmeans that there is almost always room for an election-impeding lawsuit contending that \npartisan advantage was the predominant motivation.”  Id. at 286.  This is exactly the \nsituation presented here:  Plaintiffs seek, through this litigation, to impede the upcoming \nelection due to the “lawful and common practice” of political line drawing. \n  Plaintiffs’ “effects” element, the second prong of their proposed standard, fares no \nbetter than their proposed intent element.  Plaintiffs argue that a redistricting plan has an \nunconstitutional effect where it is the case:  \n(1) that the Proposed Congressional Plan increases the number of \ndistricts that favor Democrats by at least 10% according to an \naccepted  measure  of  partisan  voting;  (2)  that  the  Proposed \nCongressional  Plan  keeps  at  least  10%  more  constituents  of \nDemocratic incumbents in the same district as their representative \nthan it does constituents of Republican incumbents; and (3) that at \nleast  one  of  the  districts  created  with  the  intent  to  advantage \nDemocrats is among the districts that contributes to the proof of \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:2488\nelements 1 and 2.  \n \nAmend. Comp., ¶ 142.  These proposed measures of purported unconstitutional effect are \nobviously unworkable.   \n  As to the proposed first element:  What does it mean to “favor” Democrats?  By \nhow much does the district have to “favor” Democrats?  Does a district that shifts from \n49.99 % Democratic to 50.01% count?  What if it switches back after the next election?  \nHow many election results  need to be reviewed to constitute sufficient evidence of \npartisanship?   In addition, it is unclear whether and how this element can take into \naccount independent or new voters in a district. \n  Moreover, as to their proposed first element, Plaintiffs argue the partisanship \n“favor” must be by an “accepted” measure.  By whom, Plaintiffs do not say.  What if \nthere is more than one measure, and they conflict?  Although they have not offered an \nexpert witness on their partisanship claims, Plaintiffs make reference to the Cook Partisan \nVoting Index, which measures partisanship in presidential elections. Amend. Comp., ¶ \n75, fn. 10.  Needless to say, this measure changes from election to election, and it \nincludes only presidential elections, omitting Congressional midterm elections and any \nother electoral contests.  Recent history demonstrates that the Partisan Indices from the \n2008 Presidential Election had little predictive value relative to the November 2010 \nCongressional elections.  As the Supreme Court noted, the difficulty with these so-called \nindices is: \na person's politics is rarely as readily discernible—and never as \npermanently discernible—as a person's race. Political affiliation is \nnot an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to \nthe next; and even within a given election, not all voters follow the \nparty line. We dare say (and hope) that the political party which \nputs forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose even in its \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:2489\nregistration stronghold. These facts make it impossible to assess \nthe effects of partisan gerrymandering, to fashion a standard for \nevaluating a violation, and finally to craft a remedy. \n \nVieth, 541 U.S. at 287 (emphasis in original).  It is impossible for any party to gauge with \ncertainty whether individual voters’ partisan preferences will change with any future \nelection, which makes such indices improper indicators of voter choice.    \n  Next, Plaintiffs argue the number of Democratic “favored” districts must increase \nby 10% in order to show an unconstitutional partisan effect.  That begs the question:  \n10% of what?  Does that refer to total districts or only Democratic Districts?  Because \nIllinois has eight Democratic Representatives, an increase of one Democratic “favored” \ndistrict would be unconstitutional (going from 8 to 9 is a 12.5% increase) under the \nPlaintiffs’ proposed standard.  Imagine a state with ten districts (five favor Democrats, \nand five favor Republicans) that, like Illinois has for two consecutive decades, loses a \ndistrict to reapportionment.  What then?  That state arguably cannot mathematically draw \na constitutional plan because the loss of one side or the other will increase partisan \nadvantage by 20%. \n  Further, Plaintiffs argue that an unconstitutional effect is apparently shown when \nthe Plan “keeps” 10% more Democrats in the “same district as their representative” than \n“it does constituents of Republican incumbents.”  Amend. Comp., ¶ 142.  The more one \nreads this allegation, the less sense it makes.  Would it mean that a given map keeps 10% \nmore Democrats with their incumbent legislator than it keeps Republicans with their \nincumbent  legislator?    Does  that  count  everyone  or  only  Democrats  in  Democratic \ndistricts and Republicans in Republican districts?  Does it apply statewide?  If so, how?  \nIs it just raw numbers or averages?  Does one count total population, VAP or CVAP, \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:2490\nregistered  voters  or  turnout?    If  partisanship  is,  as  the  Supreme  Court  says,  never \npermanently discernible for determining how people will vote, it is just as impossible to \ndiscern for purposes of determining things like district/constituent retention. \n  Plaintiffs’ proposed standard, because it depends on projecting a voter’s past \npartisan voting behavior into the future, is just as unmanageable as the standards rejected \nin Vieth.  Vieth, 541 U.S. at 288 (rejecting Plaintiffs’ proposed intent and effect standard \nas “not judicially manageable” because “[t]o begin with, how is a party’s majority status \nto be established?”).  Similarly, the Vieth Court rejected Plaintiffs’ proposed standard \nbecause it attempted to use statewide partisanship indexes for legislative districts.  Id. \n(“Moreover, to think that majority status in statewide races establishes majority status for \ndistrict contests, one would  have to believe that the only  factor determining  voting \nbehavior at all levels is political affiliation. That is assuredly not true.”). \n  Plaintiffs’ proposed standard is even further removed from legislative elections \nthan the one rejected in Vieth.  These Plaintiffs apparently want to use a partisanship \nstandard derived only from presidential elections, which is an even less reliable indicator \nof partisanship for district-level elections than statewide elections.  Moreover, they would \nhave this Court use a “national average” measure of partisanship.  Amend. Comp., fn. 10.  \nIn other words, the partisanship of Illinois’s Congressional Districts is measured against a \nbaseline that includes results from every other state.  What election returns in Montana, \nNorth Dakota, or Mississippi have to say about Illinois’s districts, Plaintiffs do not say.  \nAdditionally, the Cook Partisan Voting Index is not a reliable indicator of Congressional \nelection results in Illinois.  Prior to the 2010 midterms, the PVI favored Democrats in 10 \ndistricts and ranked one district as evenly divided.  Yet Democrats won only 8 seats in \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:2491\nthe actual election. (Cook Political Report, Partisan Voting Index Districts of the 111th \nCongress, pp. 2A.4-2A.5, http://cookpolitical.com/sites/default/files/pvistate.pdf). \n  Plaintiffs  will  no  doubt  respond  that  their  proposal,  unlike  some  others,  is \n“eminently scientific” with its different “elements” and “factors.”  See, e.g., Vieth, 541 \nU.S. at 296.  However, as noted above, Plaintiffs’ proposed standard, just like every other \n \nproposal, is designed to measure “when political gerrymandering has gone too far.” Id.  \nThe Supreme Court has rejected these multiple factor proposals because “[i]t does not \nsolve  that  problem  to  break  down  the  original  unanswerable  question  (How  much \npolitical  motivation  and  effect  is  too  much?)  into  four  more  discrete  but  equally \nunanswerable questions.” Id. at 296-97. \nFurthermore,  in  Vieth,  the  Supreme  Court  not  only  rejected  the  standards \nmentioned above, but also a proposed “totality of the circumstances” test.  Id. at 291.  \nThe  plurality  also  rejected  Justice  Stevens’  proposed  use  of  racial  gerrymandering \nanalysis (Id. at 293-294), Justice Souter’s proposed Title VII based standard (Id. at 295), \nand Justice Breyer’s proposed “unjustified entrenchment” standard.  Id. at 299.  Simply \nput,  “no  judicially  discernible  and  manageable  standards  for  adjudicating  political \ngerrymandering claims have emerged.” Id. at 285. \n  The problems with Plaintiffs’ proposed standard are too many to mention in great \ndetail, but they are similar to the very problems that caused the Supreme Court to reject \nevery proposed standard that has been presented.  This proposed standard fares no better, \nand should, like all the others, be rejected.  Count VI should be dismissed. \nB.  Count  V  Should  Be  Dismissed  Because  Partisan  Gerrymandering \nClaims Do Not Implicate the First Amendment. \n \n   Count V should be dismissed for three reasons.  First, as noted above, this Court’s \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:2492\nNovember 1, 2011 Order dismissed the First Amendment partisan gerrymandering claim \nbut did not clearly invite an amendment to that count the same way the Court did with the \nEqual Protection claim.  Mem. Op., p. 20-22.  Second, Plaintiffs’ proposed standard for \nmeasuring  partisan  gerrymandering  claims  is,  verbatim,  the  same  as  the  one  they \nproposed  for  their  Equal  Protection  claim  and,  therefore,  is  both  unworkable  and \nunreliable for the same reasons discussed above.  See Section II.A, supra.  Finally, the \nSupreme Court and courts in this District, including this Court, have consistently ruled \nthat partisan gerrymandering claims cannot plausibly implicate the First Amendment. \n  The  fact  that  Plaintiffs’  proposed  standard  for  measuring  a  First  Amendment \nviolation is exactly the same as their proposed Equal Protection standard is telling.  In \nVieth, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the notion that a First Amendment analysis is \nthe same as an Equal Protection one. Id. at 294.  Moreover, the Supreme Court also \nrejected the notion that partisan gerrymandering claims violate the First Amendment \nbecause  “a  First Amendment claim,  if  it were  sustained, would render unlawful all \nconsideration  of  political  affiliation  in  districting,  just  as  it  renders  unlawful  all \nconsideration of political  affiliation  in  hiring  for non-policy-level government jobs.” \nVieth, 541 U.S. at 294. \n  Recognizing this Supreme Court jurisprudence, courts in this judicial District have \nthrice dismissed First Amendment partisan gerrymandering claims in the last month \nalone.  First, there is this Court’s initial ruling dismissing Count V in this matter:  “The \nCommittee’s complaint contains a considerable number of allegations to the effect that \nthe 2011 Map will make it more difficult for Republican voters to elect Republican \ncandidates, but that doesn’t implicate a First Amendment right.”  Memo. Op. at 21.  In \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:2493\naddition, within the last two weeks, the three judge panel in this District that is hearing \nchallenges to the State’s legislative redistricting plan has also dismissed, with prejudice, \ntwo separate First Amendment partisan gerrymander claims.  See Radogno v. Illinois \nState Bd. of Elections, 2011 WL 5025251, *8 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 21, 2011) (dismissing First \nAmendment  partisan  gerrymandering  claim,  reasoning  that  the  “effects  of  political \ngerrymandering on the ability of a political party and its voters to elect a member of the \nparty to a seat . . . implicates no recognized First Amendment right”); League of Women \nVoters v. Quinn, 2011 WL 5143044, *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2011) (rejecting plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment partisan gerrymander claim because “it brushes aside a critical first step \nto  bringing  a  content-based  First  Amendment  challenge:    the  challenged  law  must \nactually restrict some form of protected expression.”). \n  In League of Women Voters, Plaintiffs brought a single count complaint asserting \npartisan gerrymandering under the First Amendment.  Id. at *1.  In short, Plaintiffs \nasserted that the use of political  data  in the redistricting process abridged the First \nAmendment.  Id.  In dismissing the Complaint with prejudice, the Court considered: \nUnder the redistricting plan, are LWV's members being in \nany way prohibited from running for office, expressing their \npolitical views, endorsing and campaigning for their favorite \ncandidates, voting for their preferred candidate, or otherwise \ninfluencing the political process through their expression? \nThe answer is no.  \n \nId. at *3.  The same questions can be put to the Plaintiffs here.  The redistricting plan \ndoes not prohibit them from running for office, expressing their political views, endorsing \nand  campaigning  for  candidates,  voting  for  preferred  candidates,  or  influencing  the \npolitical process through their free expression.  Thus, the Supreme Court was correct \nwhen it concluded in Vieth that partisan gerrymanders do not raise First Amendment \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 122 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:2494\nconcerns, as was this District in Radogno and League of Women Voters..  Count V should \nnow be dismissed with prejudice. \n \n  WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that this Court dismiss Count V \nand Count VI of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint with prejudice. \n \nDate:  November 11, 2011      Respectfully submitted, \n \n            LISA MADIGAN,  \n            Attorney General for the State of Illinois \n \n \n                           /s/ Brent D.

SCHOLZ,  and  ERNEST  L. \nGOWEN (collectively, “the Defendants”) hereby answer Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint for \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief: \n1.  Without any of the promised public hearings, the State of Illinois has adopted a \nnew map for the  state’s federal congressional districts (the  “Proposed Congressional \nPlan”) that blatantly discriminates against Latino and Republican voters.1 As a result \n                                                \n1 Images of the Proposed Congressional Plan—taken from the Illinois General Assembly’s \nWebsite at http://www.ilga.gov/CongressionalDistrictMaps/Statewide%20View.pdg and at \nhttp://www.ilga.gov/CongressionalDistrictMaps/Cook%20and%20Collar%20County%20View.pdf are \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 2 of 35 PageID #:2498\n \nof the Congressional Plan, Latino voters are packed into a single congressional district \nracially  gerrymandered  to  capture  an  unnecessarily  excessive  supermajority  of  Latino \nvoters, so that the votes of Latinos inside and outside that district are unlawfully diluted. \nSimilarly,  the  Proposed  Congressional  Plan—which  the  New  York  Times  has  called \n“[p]erhaps the most aggressive example of partisan maneuvering” to arise out of the 2010 \nnational census2—effectively reverses the results of the 2010 congressional elections by \nredrawing districts so that the citizens of Illinois that gave Republicans an 11 to 8 \nadvantage in Illinois’s congressional delegation only one year ago would see the state’s \ncongressional  delegation  transformed  to  one  with  12  Democrats  and  only  6 \nRepublicans (with Illinois having lost one seat in national reapportionment). The \nlaw does not permit such obviously discriminatory gerrymandering. \n \n  ANSWER:  Defendants admit that the General Assembly passed Illinois Public \nAct 97-14 (the “2011 Congressional map”).  Defendants deny the remaining allegations of \nthis paragraph.  \n2.    By  packing  excessive  numbers  of  Latino  voters  into  the \nproposed  4th  congressional district, the Proposed Congressional Plan violates the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, and \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. It sacrifices the interests of \nLatino voters in favor of preserving and strengthening white majorities in the proposed \ncongressional  districts  that  surround  proposed  District  4—proposed  District  3  and \nproposed  District  5.  Packing  Latino  voters  into  proposed  District  4  unnecessarily \n“wastes” the supermajority of Latino votes in that district, while also diluting the \ninfluence  of  Latino  voters  in  proposed  Districts  3  and  5.  The  Proposed \nCongressional Plan converts the District 4 that was created in 1991 in order to \nprovide representation to Latinos into one that now denies effective representation \nto Latinos. That intentional discrimination against Latino voters is precisely the kind of \nconduct outlawed by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the Equal Protection Clause, \nand the Fifteenth Amendment. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n3.  District  4  of  the  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  also  independently \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it is an \nintentional and unjustified racial gerrymander. The tortured “earmuff” shape of District \n4, coupled with its extremely large Latino population and the judicially established facts \nabout the creation of the district after the 1990 census, leave no doubt that race was the \n                                                                                                                                                  \nattached to this Amended Complaint as Exhibits A and B.  Images of the current congressional map—\ntaken from the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Atlas of the United States, available at \nhttp://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/pdg/congdist/pagecgd112_il.pdg are attached to this Amended \nComplaint as Exhibits C and D.  A table reflecting demographic information about the racial and ethnic \ncomposition of the proposed and current congressional districts is attached as Exhibt E.  \n2 Jennifer Steinhauer, For Republicans, Redistricting Offers Few Gains, New York Times A12 (June 12, 2011). \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 3 of 35 PageID #:2499\n \npredominant factor in drawing the district and that the district therefore is a racial \ngerrymander. And even if there were a compelling state interest in creating such a \ndistrict, proposed District 4 is not narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest. Given the \ncurrent Latino voting age population in Cook County and nearby, the “earmuff” district \nno longer complies with the Fourteenth Amendment because there are other viable and \nconstitutionally permissible alternatives to proposed District 4. The district, therefore, is \nunconstitutional. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n4.  The  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  also  is  a  partisan  gerrymander  that \nviolates  the  First  Amendment  and  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. The map as a whole and several individual districts in particular represent a \nflexing of Democratic political muscle in Springfield aimed at creating a Democratic \nmajority in the Illinois congressional delegation, regardless of the actual preferences of \nthe  electorate  demonstrated  only  one  year  ago.  It  dismantles  traditional  areas  of \nRepublican influence such as DuPage County, diluting that influence across multiple \ndistricts, many carefully connected to traditional areas of Democratic strength. At the \nsame time, the map packs Republican incumbents into the same districts or squeezes \nRepublican incumbents into Democratic-leaning districts with Democratic incumbents. \n \n  ANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n5.  The  dismantling  of  Republican  Congresswoman  Judy  Biggert’s \ncurrent  congressional  District  13  in  Southern  DuPage,  Northern  Will,  and \nSouthwestern Cook Counties is particularly striking. Under the Proposed Congressional \nPlan,  Republican-leaning  portions  of  current  District  13  are  packed  into  proposed \nDistricts 6 and 14. The removal of those voters from current District 13 allows for the \ncreation  of  proposed  District  11,  which  is  a  blatantly  gerrymandered,  irregularly \nshaped district drawn with no apparent reason other than to encompass sufficient \nDemocratic voters from Democratic strongholds such as Aurora and Joliet to create a \nnew  district  with  a  manufactured  Democratic  majority.  Adding  insult  to  injury, \nproposed District 5 sweeps in a curving hook from the Lake Michigan shoreline on the \nnorth side of Chicago around the Latino enclaves on Chicago’s west side that are \npacked into proposed District 4 until it just catches Congresswoman Biggert’s suburban \nHinsdale home at its very tip. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that District 13 under the 2011 Congressional \nmap is different than the Congressional District 13 under the 2001 Congressional map.  \nDefendants admit that Congresswoman Judy Biggert’s current residence is located in \nCongressional  District  5  under  the  2011  Congressional  map.    Defendants  deny  the \nremaining allegations contained in this paragraph. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 4 of 35 PageID #:2500\n \n6.  In short, as another New York Times article noted, “[n]o matter their \nrepeated attempts to justify the jigsaw puzzle based on census changes, Democrats took a \nrazor to their colleagues’ domain. They activated every switch at their disposal: clout, \nsecrecy and spools of electronic data that guided block-by-block precision.”3 That back-\nroom precision was used both to disenfranchise Latino voters and to guide an outrageous \npartisan gerrymander. \n \nANSWER: Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n7.  Plaintiffs therefore  file this  action  seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to prevent the use of the Proposed Congressional Plan in any future elections. \n \nANSWER: Defendants  admit  that  Plaintiffs  filed  this  action  and  seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations of this \nparagraph. \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, \n1343, and 1357. Plaintiffs bring claims arising under the United States Constitution, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, and 42 U.S.C. § 1973 for violations of their civil rights and elective \nfranchise. \n \nANSWER: Defendants admit that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1357 and that Plaintiffs purport to bring claims \narising under the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and 42 U.S.C. § 1973.  \nDefendants deny the remaining allegations of this paragraph. \n9.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because all defendants \nreside in Illinois and because some of the defendants reside in the Northern District of \nIllinois. By Illinois law, Defendant Illinois State Board of Elections is required to maintain \nan office in the City of Chicago. 10 ILCS § 5/1A-11. Pursuant to that requirement, the \nIllinois State Board of Elections maintains an office at 100 W. Randolph Street, Suite 14-\n100, Chicago, Illinois. Illinois law also requires four board members of the State Board of \nElections to be residents of Cook County. 10 ILCS § 5/1A-2. Defendant board members \nErnest Gowen, William McGuffage, Judith Rice, and Bryan Schneider reside in Cook \nCounty. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit that  venue  is proper  pursuant  to  28 U.S.C. § \n                                                \n3 Kristen McQueary, Incumbents Carve Out a New Congressional Map, New York Times, A17B (June 3, \n2011). \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 5 of 35 PageID #:2501\n \n1391(b).  Defendants state that the Illinois State Board of Elections’ responsibilities and \nduties are governed, in part, by the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS § 5/1-1, et al., and that \nthe provisions of the Illinois Election Code speak for themselves.  Defendants admit that \nIllinois State Board of Elections maintains an office at 100 W. Randolph Street, Suite 14-\n100, Chicago, Illinois and that four board members of the State Board of Elections are \nresidents of Cook County: Ernest Gowen, William McGuffage, Judith Rice, and Bryan \nSchneider.

Among other \nduties, the Board must furnish “a manual of uniform instructions ... which shall be used \nby election authorities throughout the state, 10 ILCS § 5/1A-8(3), prescribe “uniform \nforms, notices, and other supplies” to be used “in the conduct of elections and registrations,” \n10 ILCS § 5/1A-8(4), and “[r]eview and inspect procedures and records relating to conduct \nof elections and registration ... and to report violations of election laws” to appropriate \nauthorities. 10 ILCS § 5/1A-8(7).  The Board has  eight members, who are named  as \ndefendants below (collectively the “Individual Board Member Defendants”). \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 8 of 35 PageID #:2504\n \n \n   ANSWER:  Defendants  state  that  the  Illinois  State  Board  of  Elections \nresponsibilities and duties are governed, in part, by the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS § \n5/1-1, et al., and that the provisions of the Illinois Election Code speak for themselves.  \nDefendants deny any remaining allegations contained in this paragraph.   \n28.  Defendant  WILLIAM  McGUFFAGE  is  the  Chairman  of  the  Illinois \nState Board of Elections. He is sued in his official capacity. \n \n ANSWER:  Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n29.  Defendant JESSE R. SMART is the Vice Chairman of the Illinois State \nBoard of Elections. He is sued in his official capacity. \n \nANSWER: Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n30.  Defendant HAROLD D. BYERS is a member of the Illinois State Board \nof Elections.

COFFRIN is a member of the Illinois State Board \nof Elections. She is sued in her official capacity. \n \nANSWER: Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n32.  Defendant ERNEST L. GOWEN is a member of the Illinois State Board \nof Elections. He is sued in his official capacity. \n \nANSWER: Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n33.  Defendant JUDITH C. RICE is a member of the Illinois State Board of \nElections. She is sued in her official capacity. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n34.  Defendant BRYAN A. SCHNEIDER is a member of the Illinois State \nBoard of Elections. He is sued in his official capacity. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n35.  Defendant CHARLES W. SCHOLZ is a member of the Illinois State \nBoard of Elections. He is sued in his official capacity. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 9 of 35 PageID #:2505\n \n \n  ANSWER:  Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n \n36.  As a result of the decennial national census (hereinafter “the 2010 Census”) \nand congressional reapportionment, the State of Illinois lost one of its existing nineteen \ncongressional districts.  Beginning in the  next  Congress, Illinois  will have  eighteen \nmembers of the United States House of Representatives. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n37.  The Illinois General Assembly and the Governor of Illinois are charged \nwith the duty to enact a plan for dividing the state into congressional districts. In the \n2010 elections, despite gains by Republicans in both chambers of the Illinois General \nAssembly,  Democrats  retained  majority  control  of  both  the  Illinois  House  of \nRepresentatives  and  the  Illinois  Senate.  Additionally,  the  Democratic  gubernatorial \ncandidate won a very close election. As a result, the Democratic Party enjoys unified \npartisan control of state government.  \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit  that  the  Illinois  State  Constitution  gives  the \nGeneral Assembly and the Governor the responsibility for redrawing the Congressional and \nlegislative political boundaries after the decennial census and reapportionment.  Defendants \nadmit that a Democratic governor was elected in the 2010 election.  Defendants admit \nthat the current Illinois House and Senate consist of more Democratic members than \nRepublican members, but deny the remaining allegations in this paragraph. \n38.  The Proposed Congressional Plan was drawn through backroom channels \nby Illinois’s Democratic state legislative leaders, Illinois’s Democratic members of \nthe U.S. Congress, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”) \nand its agents. With respect to areas represented by Republicans, their (privately) stated \nintent  was  to  get  “more  Democratic  pick-ups”  and  to  “maximize  Democratic \nperformance.”  In  other  parts  of  the  State,  however,  the  mapmakers  monitored  and \nmassaged the Latino voting age population in crucial districts they wanted to keep safe \nfor white incumbents in the face of surging Latino populations. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n39.  While the backroom mapmaking proceeded out of public view, members of \nthe Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate held a series of hearings at \nlocations around the state between March 28, 2011 and May 2, 2011 pursuant to 10 ILCS \n125/10-5. The hearings were conducted by the Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee \nand  the  Illinois  House  Redistricting  Committee.    The  chairpersons  of  those \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 10 of 35 PageID #:2506\n \ncommittees—State  Senator Kwame Raoul, a Democrat,  and  House  Majority Leader \nBarbara Flynn Currie, also a Democrat—controlled the conduct of the hearings.4 Members \nof the public were permitted to comment, in theory, on the redistricting process and their \nrespective  communities  of  interest.  However,  pursuant  to  a  rule  established  by  the \nDemocratic chairpersons of the committees, members of the public were not permitted to \nask questions of the members of the Redistricting Committees. As stated by Senator Raoul \nat the first hearing after the state legislative map was released, “We’re taking input today. \nWe’re not fielding questions.”5 In addition, during the purported public hearings, \nthe Democratic-controlled committee never presented any draft or proposed congressional \nmaps or redistricting plan for the public to consider. \n \n  ANSWER:  Defendants admit that, pursuant to 10 ILCS § 125/10-5, members \nof the Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee and House Redistricting Committees \nheld public hearings regarding the redistricting process throughout Illinois between \nMarch 28, 2011 and May 2, 2011.  Defendants admit that Democratic State Senator \nKwame  Raoul  was the  chairperson of the Illinois  Senate  Redistricting  Committee.  \nDefendants admit that Democratic House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie was the \nchairperson  of  the  Illinois  House  Redistricting  Committee.    Defendants  admit  that \nmembers  of  the  public  commented  at  hearings  regarding  the  redistricting  process.  \nDefendants admit that the transcripts of the hearings reflect the remarks of the Members of \nthe Senate and House and the public and that these transcripts speak for themselves.  \nDefendants deny the remaining allegations of this paragraph.  Answering further, both the \nHouse and Senate Redistricting Committees consisted of Republican members of the House \nand Senate, including but not limited to: Rep. Mike Fortner; Rep. Jim Durkin; Rep. Chapin \nRose; Rep. Timothy Schmitz; Rep. Jill Tracy; Sen. Dale A. Righter; Sen. Shane Cultra; Sen. \nKirk W. Dillard; Sen. Dan Duffy; Sen. David S. Luechtefeld; and Sen. Mat Murphy.  \n4  0.        With respect to the congressional reapportionment plan, numerous commenters \nurged that “it’s crucial that input be heard after draft maps are released and when we can \n                                                \n4 See http://www.ilsenateredistricting.com. \n5 Senator Kwame Raoul, Illinois State Senate Hearing (May 21, 2011), at 69. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 11 of 35 PageID #:2507\n \ngive specific feedback about how the lines will affect our communities.”6 Moreover, \nnumerous citizen commenters, as well as Republican legislators, implored the Democratic \nleadership of the committees to release proposed maps at least one or two weeks before \nany vote would be taken, to allow for public comment.7 Chairman Raoul pledged to do \nprecisely that, stating “[i]t’s my intention to, you know, as soon as there’s a rendering of a \nmap, to post that up so people can see that and so we can have hearings afterwards and \nso people can be informed.”8 Unfortunately, as set forth below, the Senator reneged on \nthat pledge. \n \n  ANSWER:  Defendants lack sufficient knowledge or information to form a belief \nas  to  what  “numerous  commenters”  requested  of  the  Democratic  leadership  of  the \nredistricting committees, and, therefore, deny this allegation. Further answering, both the \nSenate Redistricting Committee and the House Redistricting Committee had multiple \nhearings throughout the state of Illinois where members of the public and interest groups \nparticipated and offered opinions as to what the General Assembly should consider when \ndrafting the legislative and Congressional maps.  Defendants admit that the transcripts of \nthe hearings reflect the remarks of the Members of the Senate and House and the public \nand  that  these  transcripts  speak  for  themselves.    Defendants  deny  the  remaining \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n41.  On May 18, 2011, the Democratic leadership of the Redistricting Committees \nreleased a proposed state legislative map on the Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee \nwebsite. The congressional map was not released at that time. Redistricting Committees \nin the Illinois Senate and the Illinois House of Representatives held three hearings—on \nMay 21, 22, and 24, 2011—on the proposed state map. During those meetings, several \npublic commenters pleaded for the immediate release of the congressional map, to no \n                                                \n6http://www.ilga.gov/senate/Committees/Redistricting/Final%20Approved%20Transcript%20for%20Senate%2\n0Redistricting%20Hearing%203.28.11.pdf, at 37.

Defendants lack sufficient knowledge or information \nto form a belief as for what several commenters publicly pleaded during the May 21, 22 \nand 24, 2011 redistricting hearings and, therefore, deny this allegation.  Defendants admit \nthat the transcripts of the hearings reflect the remarks of the Members of the Senate and \nHouse and the public and that these transcripts speak for themselves.  Defendants deny the \nremaining allegations of this paragraph. \n42.  At approximately 4:00 a.m., in the early morning hours of Friday, May 27, \n2011,  only  hours  before  the  start  of  Memorial  Day  Weekend,  the  Democratic \nleadership of the Redistricting Committees released a proposed congressional district \nmap, SB 1178, for the first time, posting the map on its website. No public hearings were \nheld.   \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit  that the draft  Congressional  map  was posted \nelectronically on Friday, May 27, 2011.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations of \nthis paragraph. \n                                                \n9 Rev. Alexander Sharp, CHANGE Illinois!, Illinois State Senate Hearing (May 21, 2011), \nat 73 (“We asked that the maps drafted by the legislative leaders and presented to lawmakers be posted on a \nWeb site accessible to the general public. You did that on Thursday for the Senate maps and Friday \nafternoon for the House maps. There still is the question, where is the Congressional map?”); Whitney \nWoodward, Illinois Campaign for Political Reform, id. at 77 (“In addition, ICPR knows that General \nAssembly has yet to release the draft of Congressional districts for the public to review and offer changes. This, \ntoo, is unacceptable. Ten years ago, the General Assembly gave great deference to the Congressional \nDelegation in the drawing of its own districts. It is regrettable that history seems to be repeating itself as \npublished reports have indicated that Illinois demographic [SIC, Democratic] congressmen are intimately \ninvolved with the map drawing process this time around and that the public has not been invited to sit in the \naudience, let alone the table.”); Joceyln Woodards, Illinois Campaign for Accountable \nRedistricting, Joint Illinois Senate and House Hearing (May 24, 2011), at 121, available at \nhttp://ilhousedems.com/redistricting/hearings/Springfield-May-24/95791redistrictinghrg \n05242011FullSize.pdf (“Finally, while these proposals are for the State House and State Senate boundaries, the \npublic still has not seen what this body is proposing with regard to the congressional map.

On  Sunday,  May  29,  2011,  during  Memorial  Day  Weekend,  the \nRedistricting Committee of the Illinois House of Representatives passed SB 1178 on a \nstraight  party-line  vote  (6-4).  The  next  day  the  committee  passed  an  amendment \nmaking a modest change to district lines in Southern Illinois. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit  that  the  Illinois  House  of  Representatives \nRedistricting Committee passed SB 1178 on Sunday, May 29, 2011 with six Democrats \nvoting  for  the  draft  and  four  Republicans  voting  against  it.    Answering  further, \nDefendants admit that that Committee passed an amendment to SB 1178 on Monday, \nMay 30, 2011.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations of this paragraph. \n44.  On Memorial Day, Monday, May 30, 2011, the full Illinois House \nof Representatives took up and passed the bill as amended on a straight party line vote \n(63-54, with one Republican voting present). The House debate lasted approximately \n40 minutes before a vote on the bill was called on an issue that will determine the rights \nof Illinois voters for the next decade. In committee and on the House floor, Republican \nmembers of the House questioned why the Democratic leadership failed to have public \nhearings on the Congressional map, failed to explain why there was only one majority-\nLatino district,  why the proposed districts appeared less  compact  than  the  current \ndistricts, and why the proposed districts divided recognized communities of interest. \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit  that  on  Monday,  May  30,  2011,  the  Illinois \nHouse  of  Representatives  debated  and  voted  on  the  amended  SB  1178  with  63 \nDemocrats voting for SB 1178, 54 Republicans voting against it, and 1 Republican \nvoting present.  Defendants admit that the transcripts of the hearings reflect the remarks \nof the Members of the Senate and House and the public and that these transcripts speak \nfor themselves.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations of this paragraph. \n \n45.  On Monday, May 30, 2011, just hours after the bill passed the House, \nthe Redistricting Committee of the Illinois Senate passed the amended bill on a straight \nparty-line vote (10-7). \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that the Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee \npassed the amended SB 1178 on Monday, May 30, 2011 with 10 Democrats voting in \nfavor  and  7  Republicans  voting  against  the  bill.    Defendants  deny  the  remaining \nallegations of this paragraph. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 14 of 35 PageID #:2510\n \n46.  The full Senate passed the bill the next day, again on a straight party line \nvote (34-25). At no time before the General Assembly passed SB 1178 into law did the \nDemocrats controlling either  chamber allow for  any public comment on the actual \nProposed Congressional Plan. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that the Illinois Senate considered and passed the \namended SB 1178 on Tuesday, May 31, 2011, with 34 Democrats voting in favor and 25 \nRepublicans voting against the bill.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations of this \nparagraph. \n47.  On Friday, June 24, 2011, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed SB 1178 into \nlaw. The bill took effect immediately upon becoming law. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n48.  According to the 2010 Census, Latinos are now the largest minority group \nin the State of Illinois. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit  that  the  2010  Census  lists  that  Hispanics  or \nLatinos of any race comprise 15.8% of the total population in Illinois and that this is the \nlargest percentage of the total population in Illinois for any minority group reported by the \n2010 Census.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations contained in this paragraph.  \n49.  According  to  the  2010  Census,  the  total  population  for  Illinois  is \n12,830,632. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n \n50.  Of that total, the Latino population is 2,027,578, or 15.8%. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that according to the 2010 Census, the total \npopulation of Hispanics or Latinos of any race is 2,027,578, or 15.8% of the total \npopulation in Illinois. Further answering, according to the 2010 Census, the Latino \npopulation  18  years  and  over  is  1,304,397,  or  13.4%.    Defendants  deny  the \nremaining allegations contained in this paragraph. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 15 of 35 PageID #:2511\n \n51.  The  total  population  for  the  next  largest  minority  group,  African-\nAmericans, is 1,866,414, or 14.5%. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that according to the 2010 Census, the total \npopulation  of  African  Americans  is 1,866,414,  or  14.5% of the total population of \nIllinois.  Further answering, according to the 2010 Census, the African American \npopulation 18 years and over is 1,335,818, or 13.8%.  Defendants deny the remaining \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n52.  Latinos comprise a growing proportion of the population of Illinois and \nCook County. Statewide, Latinos have increased from 12.3% of all residents in 1990 \nto 15.8% in 2010. In the same time period, the Latino population of Cook County has \nalmost doubled, increasing from 13.6% in 1990 to 24.0% in 2010. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  state  that  according  to  the  2000  Census,  the  total \npopulation of Hispanics or Latinos of any race in Illinois was 12.3% of all residents, and \naccording to the 2010 Census, the total population of Hispanics or Latinos of any race in \nIllinois is 15.8%.  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations contained in this paragraph and, therefore, deny the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n53.  Despite  Illinois’s  large  and  growing  Latino  population,  the \nProposed Congressional Plan contains only one majority Latino district, District 4, out \nof the eighteen districts created. Latinos make up 65.92% of the proposed District 4 \nvoting age population and 71.07% of the total population, far more than is necessary to \nallow the election of a candidate who is the choice of Latino voters. No other proposed \ndistrict has a Latino voting age population that exceeds 25% of the district’s voting age \npopulation. But seven other districts have a Latino voting age population that exceeds \n10%. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that the 2011 Congressional map contains eighteen \ndistricts, one of which, District 4, is a Latino voting age population majority district.  \nDefendants state that District 4 has a Latino voting age population of 65.9%.  Defendants \ndeny that District 4’s Latino voting age population is “far more than is necessary to allow \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 16 of 35 PageID #:2512\n \nthe election of a candidate who is the choice of Latino voters.”  Defendants admit the \nallegations of the last two sentences of Paragraph 53; however, further answering, the \n2011 Congressional map contains four districts, which each have a Latino voting age \npopulation in excess of 21%.  Defendants deny any remaining allegations contained in this \nparagraph.  \n54.  The  district  with  the  next  largest  Latino  population  in  the  Proposed \nCongressional Plan is proposed District 3, which borders proposed District 4 on the \nsouth. Its voting age population is 24.64% Latino. That figure represents a reduction in \nthe percentage of Latino voting age population in current District 3, which is currently \n29.31% Latino. Congressman Dan Lipinski, who is white, represents current District 3 and \nresides in proposed District 3. Proposed District 3 was drawn to protect the ability of the \nwhite majority in the proposed district to defeat the candidate of choice for Latino voters. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that Congressman Dan Lipinski is white, resides in \nand was elected to represent the 2001 Congressional District 3, and that District 3 of the \n2011  Congressional  map  is  adjacent  to  the  south  end  of  District  4  of  the  2011 \nCongressional map.   Defendants further admit that the Latino voting age population of \nthe 2001 Congressional District 3 was 29.31% and under the 2011 Congressional map is \n24.64%.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations of this paragraph.  \n55.  The district that borders proposed District 4 on the north and west is \nproposed District 5. Its voting age population is 16.05% Latino. That figure represents a \nreduction in the percentage of Latino voting age population in current District 5, which \nis  currently  24.56%  Latino.  Congressman  Mike  Quigley,  who  is  white,  represents \ncurrent District 5 and resides in proposed District 5. Proposed District 5 was drawn to \nprotect the ability of the white majority in the proposed district to defeat the candidate of \nchoice for Latino voters. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that Congressman Mike Quigley is white, resides \nin and was elected to represent the 2001 Congressional District 5, and that District 5 of the \n2011 Congressional map is adjacent to the north and south area of District 4 of the 2011 \nCongressional map.  Defendants further admit that the Latino voting age population of the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 17 of 35 PageID #:2513\n \n2001 Congressional District 5 was 24.56% and is 16.05% for the 2011 Congressional \nmap.   Defendants deny the remaining allegations of this paragraph.  \n56.  The Latino population of the State of Illinois and Cook County \nis disproportionately under the age of 18. As juvenile Latinos attain voting age over the \nnext ten years, Latinos will constitute a growing percentage of the voting age population. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout  the  truth  of  the  allegations  contained  in  this  paragraph  and,  therefore,  deny  the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n57.  Latino voters traditionally and consistently vote cohesively in the State of \nIllinois, particularly in Cook County. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout  the  truth  of  the  allegations  contained  in  this  paragraph  and,  therefore,  deny  the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n58.  Traditionally,  elections  in  Illinois  have  been  racially  and  ethnically \npolarized. The two other large racial and ethnic populations in Illinois, white non-\nLatinos  and  African  Americans  have  often voted  sufficiently as blocs  that,  in  the \nabsence  of  special  circumstances  or  a  large  Latino  voter  population,  the  preferred \ncandidates of Latino voters have been defeated. \n \n  ANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph.   \n59.  The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally discriminates against and \ndilutes the votes of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3, 4, and 5—including Plaintiffs \nLou Sandoval, Ralph Rangel, Luis Sanabria, and Michelle Caballero (collectively, the \n“Racial Dilution Plaintiffs”)—by unnecessarily packing Latino voters into proposed \nDistrict 4 and thereby reducing the Latino voter population in proposed Districts 3 and \n5. \nANSWER: Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph.  \n \n60.  Proposed District 4 is gerrymandered in an “earmuff” shape with the two \n“muffs” capturing predominately Latino neighborhoods to the north and south of proposed \nDistrict  7,  a  majority  African-American  district.  The  predominately  Latino \nneighborhoods are connected only by the earmuff’s “headband,” a narrow strip running \nalong U.S. Interstate 294. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 18 of 35 PageID #:2514\n \n \n61.  A Latino majority district with a very similar shape was created in the \nsame location after the 1990 census in judicial proceedings over redistricting. At that \ntime, the number of Latinos living in Cook County was roughly half of its current \nnumber, and it was believed that the “earmuff” district was the only way to create a \nLatino majority congressional district in Illinois. The Latino voting age population in \nthe post-1990 District 4 was 59.18%. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  deny  that  Congressional  District  4  in  the  2011 \nCongressional map  has “a  very similar  shape” to,  and  is in the  “same  location” as, \nCongressional District 4 in the 1991 Congressional map.  Defendants state that the Latino \nvoting age population in District 4 of the 1991 Congressional map was 59.2%.  Defendants \ndeny the remaining allegations contained in this paragraph. \n62.  Judicial proceedings concerning the post-1990 District 4 established that \nrace— that is, Latino ethnicity—was the predominant consideration in the creation of \nthat district. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  state  that  Paragraph  62  contains  Plaintiffs’  legal \nconclusions and do not require an answer. To the extent that an answer is required, \nDefendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph.  \n63.  Latino  ethnicity  was  the  predominant  consideration  in  the  creation  of \nproposed District 4. No other factor explains the “earmuff” shape of the proposed district or \nthe extremely high concentration of Latino voters in the proposed district. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n64.  Proposed  District  4  is  far  less  compact  than  other  districts  in  the \nProposed Congressional Plan. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n \n65.  Proposed District 4’s 0.05 Circularity Ratio—i.e., the ratio of the area of \nthe proposed districts to the area of a circle having the same perimeter—is the lowest of \nany district in the Proposed Congressional Plan. It is also lower than the Plan’s average \nof 0.16. Smaller numbers indicate less compactness. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that District 4 in the 2011 Congressional map has \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 19 of 35 PageID #:2515\n \na Polsby-Popper compactness measure of 0.05, which is lower than the other districts’ \nPolsby-Popper measures.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations contained in this \nparagraph. \n66.  Proposed District 4’s 0.24 ratio between the circumference of an equal area \ncircle divided by the perimeter of the district is the lowest of any district in the Proposed \nCongressional  Plan.  It  is  also  lower  than  the  Plan’s  average  of  0.41.  Smaller \nnumbers indicate less compactness. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout  the  truth  of  the  allegations  contained  in  this  paragraph  and,  therefore,  deny  the \nallegations contained in this paragraph.  \n67.  Proposed  District  4’s  0.42  Schwartzberg  Test  ratio—i.e.,  district  area \ndivided by the area of the district’s convex hull—is the lowest of any district in the \nProposed Congressional Plan.  It is also lower than  the Plan’s average of 0.61. \nSmaller numbers indicate less compactness. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient  to  form a \nbelief about the truth of the allegations contained in this paragraph and, therefore, deny \nthe allegations contained in this paragraph.  \n68.  Proposed District 4 is not narrowly tailored to serve the State of Illinois’s \ninterest in complying with Section 2 of Voting Rights Act. A more compact and less \nbizarrely shaped, majority-Latino district that respects traditional redistricting principles \ncan be created. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n69.  The Proposed Congressional Plan impermissibly classifies the citizens \nof  proposed  District  4—including  Plaintiff  Luis  Sanabria  (the  “Racial  Gerrymander \nPlaintiff”)—by their race. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n \n70.  Working  together,  the  Democratic  leadership  of  the  Illinois  General \nAssembly,  the  DCCC,  its  agents,  and  certain  Democratic  members  of  Congress \ndeveloped the Proposed  Congressional  Plan by engaging in impermissible partisan \ngerrymandering that dilutes the ability of Republican voters in Illinois to elect candidates \nof their choice. \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 20 of 35 PageID #:2516\n \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n71.  Illinois is relatively evenly divided between Republican and Democratic \nvoters. From 1999 to 2005 and again from 2011 to the present, Illinois has been \nrepresented  in  the  United  States  Senate  by  one  Republican  and  one  Democratic \nsenator. Republicans held the office of Governor of Illinois from 1977 to 2003, and \nDemocrats have held it from 2003 to the present. In the 2010 Illinois United States \nSenate race,  Republican Candidate  Mark Kirk  received 48.01% of the vote, while \nDemocratic Candidate Alexi Giannoulias received 46.42%. Similarly, in the 2010 Illinois \ngubernatorial election, Democratic Candidate Pat Quinn received 46.79% of the vote, \nwhile Republican Bill Brady received 45.94%. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants state that from 1985 to 1999 and from 2005 to 2010, \nIllinois has been represented in the United States Senate by two Democratic Senators.  \nDefendants admit that from 1999 to 2005 and again from 2011 to the present, Illinois \nhas been represented by one Democratic and one Republican Senator.  Defendants \nadmit that Republicans held the office of Governor of Illinois from 1977 to 2003, and \nDemocrats have held it from 2003 to the present. Defendants admit that in the 2010 \nIllinois United States Senate race, Republican Candidate Mark Kirk received 48.01% \nof the vote, and Democratic Candidate Alexi Giannoulias received 46.42%. Defendants \nadmit that in the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, Democratic Candidate Pat Quinn \nreceived 46.79% of the vote, while Republican Bill Brady received 45.94%.  Defendants \ndeny any remaining allegations contained in this paragraph. \n72.  The  Illinois  congressional  delegation  has  been  similarly  divided \nbetween  Republicans  and  Democrats. Following the 2002  elections, there were 10 \nRepublican and 9 Democratic Congressmen from Illinois. In 2004, 9 Republican and 10 \nDemocratic  Congressmen  were  elected.  In  2006,  8  Republican  and  11  Democratic \nCongressmen were elected. In 2008, 7 Republican and 12 Democratic Congressmen were \nelected. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that following the 2002 elections, there were 10 \nRepublican and 9 Democratic Congressmen from Illinois. Defendants admit that in 2004, \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 21 of 35 PageID #:2517\n \n9 Republican and 10 Democratic Congressmen were elected.  Defendants state that in \n2006, 9 Republican and 10 Democratic Congressmen were elected. Defendants admit that \nin 2008, 7 Republican and 12 Democratic Congressmen were elected. Defendants deny \nthe remaining allegations contained in this paragraph. \n73.  In  2010,  voters  rejected  four  Democratic  incumbents  in  favor  of \nRepublican challengers and elected a Republican candidate to the seat vacated as a result \nof Republican Congressman Mark Kirk’s decision to run for United States Senate, \nresulting in a delegation of 11 Republican and 8 Democratic Congressmen. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit that four Democratic  incumbent Congressional \nrepresentatives lost in the 2010 election to Republican candidates.  Defendants admit that \nMark Kirk’s former Congressional seat, which was vacated in 2010 when Mark Kirk ran \nfor United States Senate, is now held by Republican Robert Dold.  Defendants admit that \nthe current Illinois Congressional delegation consists of 11 Republican and 8 Democratic \nCongressmen.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations contained in this paragraph. \n74.  Despite  the  2010  Congressional  election  results  and  the  relatively  even \ndivision of voters between parties in Illinois, the Proposed Congressional Plan creates a \nsituation in which the Illinois Congressional delegation  is likely to  go from its \ncurrent composition of 11 Republicans and 8 Democrats to only 6 Republicans and 12 \nDemocrats. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout  the  truth  of  the  allegations  contained  in  this  paragraph  and,  therefore,  deny  the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n75.  According  to  the  Partisan  Voting  Index  developed  by  Charlie  Cook \n(“PVI”),  the  most  widely  used  and  accepted  measure  of  partisan  leanings  for \ncongressional districts, the Proposed Congressional Plan increases the number of districts \nthat  favor  Democrats  by  nearly  20  percentage  points.10  Nine  of  the  19  Illinois \n                                                \n10 The PVI is a measurement of how strongly a congressional district leans toward one political party compared \nto the nation as a whole. The index for each congressional district is derived by averaging its results from the \nprior two presidential elections and comparing them to national results. The index indicates which party’s \ncandidate was more successful in that district, as well as the number of percentage points by which its results \nexceeded the national average. The index is formatted as a letter followed by a plus sign and then a number. For \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 22 of 35 PageID #:2518\n \ncongressional districts (47.4%) have Democratic-leaning PVI scores under the current \ncongressional plan, which was adopted through a bipartisan process in 2001. By contrast, \nunder the Proposed Congressional Plan, 12 of the 18 Illinois congressional districts \n(66.7%) have Democratic-leaning PVI scores. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n76.  The  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  accomplishes  that  result  by  packing \ntraditional Republican voters statewide into a relatively small number of proposed \ndistricts and then dividing the remaining Republican voters into districts that include \nreliable majorities of Democratic voters. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n77.  While  the  entire  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  reflects  a  statewide \npartisan gerrymander, proposed District 11 is an especially blatant example of partisan \ngerrymandering.  That  district  was  created  by  dismantling  current  District  13, \nrepresented by  seven-term, Republican  Congresswoman  Judy  Biggert,  the  only \nwoman  in  the  current  Republican  congressional  delegation.  Current District  13  is \nlocated  in  southern  DuPage,  northern  Will,  and  southwestern  Cook  Counties  and \nencompasses  a  number  of  western  and  southwestern  suburbs  of  Chicago  such  as \nBolingbrook, Naperville, Orland Park, Downers Grove, Westmont, and Woodridge. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that Judy Biggert is the Congresswoman for \nCongressional District 13 under the 2001 Congressional map and is in her seventh term \nas a Congresswoman.  Defendants admit that Judy Biggert is the only woman in the \ncurrent  Republican  Congressional  delegation.  Defendants  admit  that  Congressional \nDistrict 13 under the 2001 Congressional map includes portions of DuPage, Will, and \nCook Counties. Defendants deny the remaining allegations contained in this paragraph. \n78.  In  the  2010  Illinois  gubernatorial  election,  the  Republican  candidate \nreceived 53.66% of the vote in current District 13, while the Democratic  candidate \nreceived 38.49%. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations contained in this paragraph and, therefore, deny the \n                                                                                                                                                  \ninstance, in a district whose PVI score is D+2, a generic Democratic candidate would be expected to receive 2 \npercentage points more votes than the national average. An “Even” score is assigned when the district \nperformed within half a point of the national average. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 23 of 35 PageID #:2519\n \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n79.  The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally slices current District 13 into \nsix proposed Districts (proposed Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 11, and 14) in order to dilute the \ninfluence of Republican voters. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that Public Act 97-14, the 2011 Congressional \nmap, divides District 13 of the 2001 Congressional map into six Districts (1, 3, 5, 6, 11 \nand 14).  Defendants deny the remaining allegations in this paragraph. \n80.  The  Proposed Congressional Plan first packs Republican  enclaves in \nNaperville and Downers Grove into proposed Districts 6 and 14, resulting in new \ndistricts whose electorate is overwhelmingly Republican. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n \n81.  In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed \nDistrict 6 voted 57.79% for the Republican candidate and 34.59% for the Democratic \ncandidate. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations contained in this paragraph and, therefore, deny the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n82.  In the  2010 Illinois  gubernatorial  election, the  electorate of proposed \nDistrict 14 voted 57.19% for the Republican candidate and 32.91% for Democratic \ncandidate. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations contained in this paragraph and, therefore, deny the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n83.  By packing Republican voters into proposed Districts 6 and 14, the drafters of \nthe Proposed Congressional Plan were able to create a new, snake-shaped proposed \nDistrict 11 centered around Aurora, Bolingbrook, and Joliet that combines just enough \nDemocratic  enclaves  in  those  communities  to  give  the  proposed  district  a  likely \nmajority of Democratic voters, diluting the votes of Republican voters captured in the \nconnecting segments. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 24 of 35 PageID #:2520\n \n \n84.  In the  2010 Illinois  gubernatorial  election, the  electorate of proposed \nDistrict 11 voted 46.02% for the Republican candidate and 44.86% for the Democratic \ncandidate. However, in the 2008 Presidential election, the electorate of proposed District \n11  voted  61.10%  for  the  Democratic  candidate  and  37.01%  for  the  Republican \ncandidate.  Similarly,  in  the  2006  Illinois  gubernatorial  election,  the  electorate  of \nproposed District 11 voted 46.82% for the Democratic candidate and 40.16% for the \nRepublican  candidate.  Finally,  in  the  2004  Presidential  election  the  electorate  of \nproposed District 11 voted 49.94% for the Democratic candidate and 48.42% for the \nRepublican candidate. On average, Democratic candidates in these elections received \n6.66% more votes in proposed District 11 than in current District 13, while the Republican \ncandidates in these elections received 7.29% fewer votes, for a total average vote swing \nof 13.96% in favor of the Democratic candidates. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations and, therefore, deny the allegations contained in this \nparagraph. \n85.  Finally, proposed District 5 starts at the shores of Lake Michigan on the \nnorth side of Chicago, stretches west to O’Hare Airport, and then swings south around \nproposed District 4 to just capture Congresswoman Biggert’s suburban Hinsdale home. \nProposed District 5 has a Democratic majority as well as a Democratic incumbent, Mike \nQuigley. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that Congresswoman Biggert’s current residence \nis  located in District  5 under the  2011  Congressional  map.   Defendants admit  that \nCongressman Mike Quigley’s current residence is located in District 5 under the 2011 \nCongressional map.  Defendants deny the remaining allegations in this paragraph. \n86.  In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed \nDistrict 5 voted 36.17% for the Republican candidate and 54.18% for the Democratic \ncandidate. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations and, therefore, deny the allegations contained in this \nparagraph. \n87.  Further evidencing its partisan animus, the Proposed Congressional Plan \ndraws some Republican incumbents into the same districts, forcing them to run against \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 25 of 35 PageID #:2521\n \neach other or move, while it also places Republican incumbents in Democratic-\nleaning districts with Democratic incumbents. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations contained in this paragraph and, therefore, deny the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n88.  The  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  places  incumbent  Republican \nCongressmen Joe Walsh and Randy Hultgren in proposed District 14, forcing them to run \nagainst each other in the Republican primary or move. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants admit that Congressmen Joe Walsh’s current residence \nis  located  in  District  14  in  the  2011  Congressional  map.  Defendants  admit  that \nCongressman Randy Hultgren’s current residence is located in District 14 in the 2011 \nCongressional map.  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the remaining allegations and, therefore, deny the remaining allegations \ncontained in this paragraph. \n89.  The Proposed Congressional Plan does not place a single Democratic \nincumbent in the same Congressional district as another Democratic incumbent. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants state that the current residences of Democratic incumbent \nU.S. Representatives are each in separate districts under the 2011 Congressional map.  \nDefendants deny the remaining allegations contained in this paragraph.  \n90.  The  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  places  incumbent  Republican \nCongressman Adam Kinzinger and incumbent Democratic Congressman Jesse Jackson, \nJr. in proposed District 2. Proposed District 2 is significantly weighted in favor of a \nDemocratic candidate.  Proposed  District 2  contains 78% of Congressman Jackson’s \ncurrent district. Also, in the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, proposed District 2 \nvoted 70.76% in favor of the Democratic candidate and only 20.50% in favor of the \nRepublican candidate. In the 2008 and 2004 Presidential elections, it voted 80.64% \nand 73.56% in favor of the Democratic candidate and only 17.57% and 24.17% in favor \nof the Republican candidate. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants state that the current residences of Congressman Adam \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 26 of 35 PageID #:2522\n \nKinzinger and Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. are located in District 2 under the 2011 \nCongressional map. Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the remaining allegations and, therefore, deny the remaining allegations \ncontained in this paragraph. \n91.  As  already  noted,  the  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  places  incumbent \nRepublican Congresswoman Judy Biggert and incumbent Democratic Congressman \nMike Quigley in proposed District 5. Proposed District 5 is significantly weighted in \nfavor of a Democratic candidate. Proposed District 5 contains 72% of Congressman \nQuigley’s current district. Also, in the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, it voted \n54.18%  in  favor  of  the  Democratic  candidate  and  only  36.17%  in  favor  of  the \nRepublican candidate. In the 2008 and 2004 Presidential elections, it voted 68.62% \nand 62.59% in favor of the Democratic Candidate and only 28.89% and 35.22% in favor \nof the Republican candidate. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants state that the current residences of Congresswoman Judy \nBiggert  and  Congressman  Mike  Quigley  are  located  in  District  5  under  the  2011 \nCongressional map.  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the remaining allegations and, therefore, deny the remaining allegations \ncontained in this paragraph. \n92.  The  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  places  incumbent  Republican \nCongressman Bob Dold and incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky in \nproposed  District  9.  Proposed  District  9  is  significantly  weighted  in  favor  of  a \nDemocratic  candidate.  Proposed  District  9  contains  77%  of  Congresswoman \nSchakowsky’s current district. Also, in the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, it voted \n55.30%  in  favor  of  the  Democratic  candidate  and  only  36.68%  in  favor  of  the \nRepublican candidate. In the 2008 and 2004 Presidential elections, it voted 67.74% and \n62.63% in favor of the Democratic Candidate and only 30.17% and 35.03% in favor of the \nRepublican candidate. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants state that the current residences of Congresswoman Jan \nSchakowsky  and  Congressman  Bob  Dold  are  located  in  District  9  under  the  2011 \nCongressional map.   Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the remaining allegations and, therefore, deny the remaining allegations \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 27 of 35 PageID #:2523\n \ncontained in this paragraph. \n93.  The Proposed Congressional Plan also favors Democratic incumbents in \nterms of overlap of population between current and proposed congressional districts. \nThe  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  places  Republican  incumbents  in  districts  whose \npopulation overlaps with an average of 34.20% of their current districts. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations contained in this paragraph and, therefore, deny the \nallegations contained in this paragraph. \n94.  By  contrast,  the  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  places  Democratic \nincumbents in districts whose population overlaps with an average of 77.52% of their \ncurrent districts. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations and, therefore, deny the allegations contained in this \nparagraph. \n95.  The population overlaps for Democratic incumbents range from a high of \n100.0% (proposed District 12) to a low of 76.3% (proposed District 3), with an average \nof 87.8%  across  all  Democratic  incumbents.  The  highest  Republican  incumbent’s \npopulation overlap is only 67.9% (proposed District 18), while the lowest is a mere \n1.3% (proposed District 5), with an average of 34.4% across all Republican incumbents. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations and, therefore, deny the allegations contained in this \nparagraph. \n96.  The  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  also  unnecessarily  splits  a  significant \nnumber of prominent and populous communities, including Bloomington, Champaign, \nDeKalb, Peoria, Rockford, and Urbana, into multiple congressional districts, reducing \nthe ability of these communities to select representatives of their choice. It also divides \nsignificant  Chicago  suburbs  (with  populations  greater  than  25,000  people), \nincluding Algonquin, Carol Stream, Carpentersville, Cicero, Crystal Lake, Glen \nEllyn, Glendale Heights, Glenview, Gurnee, Hanover Park, Lake in the Hills, Melrose \nPark, Mundelein, Oswego, Streamwood, Waukegan, Wheaton, and Woodridge, as well as \nChicago’s Chinatown neighborhood. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph.  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 28 of 35 PageID #:2524\n \n97.  The  Proposed  Congressional  Plan  is  less  compact  than  the  present \ncongressional map.   \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n98.  The  present  congressional  map  has  a  Circularity  Ratio  of  0.19.  The \nProposed Congressional Plan has a Circularity Ratio of 0.16. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph.     \n99.  The present congressional map has a ratio of the circumference of an \nequal  area  circle  divided  by  the  perimeter  of  the  proposed  districts  of  0.45.  The \nProposed Congressional Plan has a ratio of 0.41. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations and, therefore, deny the allegations contained in this \nparagraph. \n100.  The present congressional map has a Schwartzberg Test ratio of 0.64. \nThe Proposed Congressional Plan has a ratio of 0.61. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief \nabout the truth of the allegations and, therefore, deny the allegations contained in this \nparagraph. \n101.  By  diluting  the  votes  of  Republican  voters—including  plaintiffs \nCommittee for a Fair and Balanced Map, Peter J. Roskam, Joe Walsh, Robert J. Dold, \nAdam Kinzinger, Judy Biggert, Randy Hultgren, Donald Manzullo, Bobby Schilling, \nAaron Schock, John M. Shimkus, Laura Waxweiler, and Edmund Brezinski (collectively, \nthe “Partisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs”)— the partisan gerrymander embodied in the \nProposed Congressional Plan intentionally discriminates against Republican voters \nand penalizes Republican voters based on their voting history and other expressions of \npolitical views. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n102.  The Illinois State Board of Elections has “general supervision over \nthe administration of the registration and election laws throughout the State,” Ill. Const. \n1970, art. III § 5; 10 ILCS § 5/1A-1, and must “[s]upervise the administration of the \nregistration and election laws throughout the State.” 10 ILCS § 5/1A-8(12). \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  state  that  the  Illinois  State  Board  of  Elections’ \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 29 of 35 PageID #:2525\n \nresponsibilities and duties are governed, in part, by the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS § \n5/1-1, et al., and that the provisions of the Illinois Election Code speak for themselves.   \n103.  In  accordance  with  that  mandate,  the  State  Board  of  Elections  is \nrequired to, among other  things, “[d]isseminate  information to  and  consult  with \nelection authorities concerning the conduct of elections and registration” 10 ILCS § 5/1A-\n8(2), furnish “a manual of uniform instructions ... which shall be used by election \nauthorities” throughout the state, 10 ILCS § 5/1A-8(3), prescribe “uniform forms, \nnotices, and other supplies” to be used “in the conduct of elections and registrations,” \n10 ILCS § 5/1A-8(4), “[r]eview and inspect procedures and records relating to conduct \nof elections and registration ... and to report violations of election laws” to appropriate \nauthorities. 10 ILCS § 5/1A-8(7). \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  state  that  the  Illinois  State  Board  of  Elections’ \nresponsibilities and duties are governed, in part, by the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS § \n5/1-1, et al., and that the provisions of the Illinois Election Code speak for themselves.   \n104.

The 2012 Illinois primary election for United States Congress is March \n20, 2012. 10 ILCS § 5/2A-1.1(a), as recently amended by Public Act 96-866. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants state that the next General Primary Election will occur \non March 20, 2012.   \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n(Violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1973 against All Defendants \nbrought by the Racial Dilution Plaintiffs) \n \n108.  Plaintiffs reallege the facts set forth in paragraphs 1 through 107, above. \nANSWER:  Defendants reallege their answers to paragraphs 1 through 107 \nabove as the answer to this paragraph. \n109.  Count  I  is  brought  by the  Racial  Dilution  Plaintiffs  against  Defendant \nIllinois State Board of Elections as well as the Individual Board Member Defendants in their \nofficial capacities. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants  admit  that  Plaintiffs  bring  this  Count  against  the \nDefendant,  Illinois  State  Board  of  Elections,  as  well  as the  Individual  Board  Member \nDefendants in their official capacities, but deny that there is any validity to this Count. \n110.  The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally discriminates against Latino \nvoters on the basis of their race. The Plan intentionally dilutes the votes of Latino voters by \npacking an excessive super-majority of Latino voters into proposed District 4 and \nby simultaneously reducing the growing percentage of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3 \nand 5. Many Latino voters in proposed District 4 will see their votes wasted because \nthe Plan intentionally makes those votes unnecessary to elect a candidate of their choice. \nAt the same time, Latino voters in proposed Districts 3 and 5 will be prevented by their \nintentionally  diminished  numbers  from  having  any  significant  influence  in  choosing \nprimary and general election candidates of their choice. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 31 of 35 PageID #:2527\n \n111.  As a result, the Proposed Congressional Plan denies or abridges the right of \nthe Racial Dilution Plaintiffs to vote, on account of their race or color, and affords the \nRacial  Dilution  Plaintiffs  less  opportunity  than  other  members  of  the  electorate  to \nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n112.

As a result, the Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally treats the Racial \nDilution Plaintiffs differently and worse than it treats similarly situated voters who are \nnot Latino. And the Plan does so because the Racial Dilution Plaintiffs are Latino. \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 124 Filed: 11/11/11 Page 32 of 35 PageID #:2528\n \n \n117.

The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally made race—namely, Latino \nethnicity—the predominant factor in the creation of proposed District 4. That proposed District \ndisregards traditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for \npolitical subdivisions. Instead, it manufactures a Latino voting age supermajority of 65.92% \nby packing Latino residents into an earmuff-shaped district so bizarre on its face that race is the \nonly explanation for the shape and demographic composition of the District. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n126.  Proposed District 4 is not narrowly tailored to serve an interest in complying \nwith the Voting  Rights Act  because  it includes far more  Latino voters than  would  be \nnecessary to comply with that law and a Latino majority district can be drawn without racial \ngerrymandering. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n127.  As a result, proposed District 4 impermissibly classifies the Racial Gerrymander \nPlaintiff by his race. \n \nANSWER:  Defendants deny the allegations contained in this paragraph. \n128.

Joan Humphrey Lefkow\nDefendants. )\nOPINION AND ORDER\nBefore TINDER, Circuit Judge, MILLER, District Judge, and LEFKOW, District Judge.\nPER CURIAM. This case involves a challenge to the congressional redistricting plan adopted\nby the State of Illinois after the 2010 Census. The plaintiffs are an organization called the Committee\nfor a Fair and Balanced Map (a not-for-profit organization created by Illinois citizens concerned\nabout the congressional redistricting process in Illinois), ten incumbent Republican members of\nCongress, and six registered voters (including some who identify themselves as Latino voters and\nothers who assert that they are Republican voters), collectively referred to as “the Committee.” The\ndefendants are the Illinois State Board of Elections (the agency charged with implementing the\nresults of the redistricting process) and its members, collectively referred to as “the Board of\nElections.” The United States Constitution requires Illinois lawmakers to redraw the state’s\ncongressional district boundaries after each decennial census. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 2; id. amend.\nXIV, §§ 1 & 2; id . amend. XV; Ryan v. State Bd. of Elections of State of Ill., 661 F.2d 1130, 1132\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 2 of 55 PageID #:3230\n(7th Cir. 1981). Pursuant to this authority, the Democratic majority in the Illinois General Assembly\ndrafted, debated,1 and passed the Illinois Congressional Redistricting Act of 2011 (the “Redistricting\nAct”) (P.A. 97-14), thereby creating what we refer to as “the Adopted Map.” Based on the 2010\nCensus results, the State of Illinois lost one congressional seat. The Adopted Map, therefore,\neliminates one seat and establishes boundaries for the state’s eighteen remaining congressional\ndistricts. \nThe Committee contends that the Adopted Map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a) (Count I), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and rights\nprotected by the Fifteenth Amendment, because Congressional Districts 3, 4, and 5 as drawn \nintentionally dilute the Latino vote (Counts II and III). They also allege violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause in that Latino ethnicity was the predominant consideration in drawing Adopted\nDistrict 4 and as such, is an intentional and unjustified racial gerrymander (Count IV). Taking\nanother tack, the Committee alleges that Adopted Districts 11, 13 and 17 demonstrate a blatant\npartisan gerrymander against Republican voters in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n(Counts V and VI). \nWe held a two-day trial on the Committee’s motion for permanent injunction and, after\nexamining the parties’ briefs and extensive documentary and testimonial evidence, including the\nexpert reports and testimony, we find in favor of the Board of Elections. As to the partisan\ngerrymander claims, although we agree with the Committee that the crafting of the Adopted Map\nwas a blatant political move to increase the number of Democratic congressional seats, ultimately\nwe conclude that the Committee failed to present a workable standard by which to evaluate such\n1Albeit briefly, but more about that later. \n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 3 of 55 PageID #:3231\nclaims, therefore they fail under Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004). The Committee’s vote\ndilution claims fail because the Committee has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that\nthe state legislature intentionally discriminated against Latinos in passing the Adopted Map. Again,\nwe acknowledge that Latino ethnicity was a factor in creating District 4 in 1991, but times have\nchanged: the weight of the evidence shows that the predominant intent of the 2011 Illinois\nlegislature in maintaining Adopted District 4 in substantially the same shape as when it was created\nin 1991 was a desire to enhance Democratic seats in the state as a whole, to keep Democratic\nincumbents in Districts 3, 4, and 5 with their constituents, to preserve existing district boundaries,\nand to maintain communities of interest. Because race was not the predominant factor, the\nCommittee failed to meet its burden of proof on its racial gerrymander claims under Section 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act or the Constitution.\nI. Facts \nThe Committee’s racial vote dilution and gerrymandering claims concern Adopted Districts \n3, 4 and 5, and its political gerrymandering claims concern Adopted Districts 11, 13, and 17. We set\nforth the facts below to provide an overview as necessary to understand the bases of those claims. \nA. Racial Claims: Adopted Districts 3, 4, and 5\nThis litigation focuses primarily on District 4 in the Adopted Map, so we begin with the\nhistory of District 4. Following the 1990 Census, Illinois lost a congressional seat and the Illinois\nGeneral Assembly was required to draw new district boundaries for the state. When the General\nAssembly failed to undertake its constitutional obligation to draw a new map, the court in Hastert\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 4 of 55 PageID #:3232\nv. State Bd. of Elections, 777 F. Supp. 634, 637 (N.D. Ill. 1991), was called upon to devise one.\nHispanic voters also sought the creation of a Latino majority congressional district under Section\n2 of the Voting Rights Act. Both parties agreed that, given population and demographic changes\nwithin the City of Chicago, a Latino majority district was mandated by Section 2. See id. at 640. \nThe goal of the litigants was to create a new Latino majority district while maintaining the\nthree  African-American  majority  districts,  Districts  1,  2,  and  7.  The  result  was  a  bizarre\nconfiguration of District 4. Id. at 648 n. 24. The court explained that “the Chicago Hispanic\ncommunity resides principally in two dense enclaves, one on Chicago’s near northwest side and one\non the near southwest side.” Id. District 7, one of the African-American majority-minority districts,\nruns “roughly in an east-west direction along Chicago’s central latitudes from Lake Michigan to the\nwestern suburbs,” and separates the two Hispanic enclaves. Id. The parties’ proposed plans in that\ncase both connected the “northwest and southwest side Hispanic enclaves by running a narrow\ncorridor around the western end of [District 7], creating a C-shaped configuration.” Id. The western\nportion of the proposed plans, specifically, the part west of Central Avenue connecting the northwest\nand southwest enclaves is referred to as the “connector arm.” Both proposed maps shot out rays from\nthe northwest and southwest enclaves to capture additional Latino population. Id. The court\ncommented that “[f]ew districts have quite so an extraordinary appearance.” Id.\nThe court found that “the Chicago/Cook County Hispanic community [was] ‘sufficiently\nlarge and geographically compact’ to constitute a single district majority.” Id. at 649 (citation\nomitted). It noted that the two Latino enclaves are less than one mile apart at their closest point and\nthat this separation resulted from exogenous physical and institutional barriers, and thus did not\nindicate the existence of two distinct communities. Id. & n.25. The court further found that the\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 5 of 55 PageID #:3233\nLatino community was politically cohesive and that voting in the area was racially polarized. Id. at\n650. The racially polarized voting, the court found, “thwarted the political interests of the Hispanic\ncommunity.” Id. The court reasoned that “[t]he location of the Chicago Hispanic community in two\nhighly concentrated enclaves on either side of [District 7] on Chicago’s near northwest and near\nsouthwest sides necessarily requires an odd configuration to accommodate the creation of an\nHispanic district and the three super-majority African-American districts dictated under the Voting\nRights Act.” Id. at 650. After considering the totality of circumstances, the court concluded that\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act mandated a majority-minority Latino district and ultimately\nadopted the Hastert plan, thereby creating the C-shaped District 4, a district that had 59.18 percent\nof the Latino voting age population.2 Id. at 648-50.\nIn 1996, the court was asked to reexamine whether District 4 violated the constitution, inter\nalia, in light of Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993) (Shaw I) and Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900\n(1995), see King v. State Bd. of Elections, 979 F. Supp. 582, 586 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (King I), which\nrecognize an equal protection claim based on segregating voters in separate districts based on race.\nKing I addressed “whether in attempting to remedy a Section 2 Voting Rights Act violation, the\nHastert court adopted a redistricting plan that apportioned the electorate on the basis of race and\nethnicity in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 599. \nThe King I court found that racial considerations predominated in the creation of District 4.\nId. at 605. Indeed, the parties had agreed (in Hastert) that a Hispanic majority district was mandated\nand had agreed to the proposed configuration of District 4; thus, the “district’s bizarre shape was\n2 The map of District 4 adopted by the Hastert court can be found in King v. State Bd. of\nElections, 979 F. Supp. 582, 586 n.2 (N.D. Ill. 1996).  \n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 6 of 55 PageID #:3234\neffectively determined by the litigants and not the court.” Id. at 606 (emphasis in original). The court\nadded that District 4's “extremely irregular configuration create[d] a strong inference . . . that its\nshape rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into\ndifferent districts on the basis of race.” Id. The court further noted that district lines “follow the\nconcentrations of the Hispanic population with ‘exquisite’ detail.” Id. at 608-09. The only logical\nconclusion to be drawn from the shape and demographics of District 4, the court concluded, was\n“that racial considerations predominated over all other factors in the configuration.” Id. at 607.\nNonetheless, the King I court upheld District’s 4 odd shape under strict scrutiny upon finding that\nits configuration was necessary to remedy a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Id. at\n614-15.\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court vacated the King I judgment and remanded the case for\nreconsideration in light of two then-recent Supreme Court cases, Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899 (1996)\n(Shaw II) and Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952 (1996). See King v. Ill. Bd. of Elections, 519 U.S. 978\n(1996). On remand, the King court reaffirmed its holding, concluding that District 4 was narrowly\ntailored to further a compelling state interest of remedying a potential violation or achieving\ncompliance with Section 2. King v. State Bd. of Elections, 979 F. Supp. 619, 620, 627 (N.D. Ill.\n1997) (King II), summarily aff’d, 522 U.S. 1087 (1998). \nAfter the 2000 Census, Illinois had to redraw the congressional districts. The legislature kept\nDistrict 4 in substantially the same shape as the Hastert District 4. We refer to this map as the\n“Current Map.”3 There was no challenge to District 4 as drawn in the Current Map. The next map,\n3 The Current Map of Cook County and statewide is attached to this opinion as Appendix A\nand B.\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 7 of 55 PageID #:3235\nnow in litigation, what we call “the Adopted Map,” was passed by the 2011 Illinois General\nAssembly after the 2010 Census.4 \nTo comply with the one-person, one-vote requirement after losing a congressional district,\nthe state had to add population (approximately 112,000 people) to District 4. As stated above, when\nDistrict 4 was created under Hastert, it contained 59.2 percent Latino voting-age population.\nBetween 1990 and 2010, the Latinos share of the voting-age population in Cook County increased\nfrom 11.5 percent to 20.8. At the time of the 2010 Census, the Latino voting-age population\npercentage of District 4 stood at 68.1 percent. Adopted District 4 reduces that by 2.2 percent and\nincludes 65.9 percent Latino voting-age population. Adopted District 4 continues to have the C-\nshaped boundaries surrounding District 7, which remains a majority-minority (African-American)\ndistrict. According to the Board of Elections’ figures, 82 percent of the population from Current\nDistrict 4 remains in Adopted District 4. \nThere are certain notable changes in Adopted District 4 compared to Hastert District 4. For\nexample, Adopted District 4 splits 40 precincts, compared to 218 in that prior district. See King I,\n979 F. Supp. at 610.This is likely due in part to the realignment of precincts in 1992. Id. at 610 n.52\n(stating that District 4 split only 61 of the realigned 1992 precincts). Adopted District 4 is also\nslightly more compact, and some of the zigzag-shaped edges are smoothed out. The transfer of\ncertain low-percentage Latino areas west of Central Avenue from previous District 3 had the effect\nof substantially increasing the population in the connector arm, making the district slightly more\ngeographically compact. The connector arm in 1991 contained 5 percent of the total population of\nthe district. Under Adopted District 4, it contains 26 percent. \n4 The Adopted Map of Cook County and statewide is attached to this opinion as Appendix\nC and D. \n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 8 of 55 PageID #:3236\nThe experts who testified at trial relied on two widely acceptable tests to determine\ncompactness scores:  the Polsby-Popper measure and the Reock indicator. The Polsby-Popper score\nis a perimeter measure that considers how efficiently the area of a district is encompassed by its\nperimeter and boundary. The Reock score is a geographic dispersion measure that considers how\ntightly packed the area is in a district. Scores in both tests range from just above zero to one with\nhigher scores indicating more compact districts. The Polsby-Popper score for Adopted District 4 is\n.05 and the Reock score is .30. The Board of Elections’ expert opined that low compactness is equal\nto or less than .05 on the Polsby-Popper measure and equal or less than .15 on the Reock measure.\nIn 1991, the Polsby-Popper measure for District 4 was .02 and the Reock measure was .20.\nAccordingly, the compactness of District 4 has increased, but it is still at the threshold level for low\ncompactness on the Polsby-Popper score and still fails the “eyeball test”  – based on a visual\ninspection of the district lines – for compactness. See King I, 979 F. Supp. 582 (finding that the\nHastert District 4 was not “visually compact.”).\nAdopted Districts 3 and 5 border District 4; District 3 lies to the south and District 5 to the\nnorth of Adopted District 4. On the Adopted Map, Latino voting-age population in District 3 is\nreduced from 29.3 to 24.6 percent and in District 5 from 24.6 to 16.1 percent. Congressman Luis\nGutierrez (a Latino member of the Democratic Party), is the incumbent in District 4, and has won\nevery congressional election in that district since it was created. Congressman Dan Lipinski is the\nincumbent in District 3 and Congressmen Mike Quigley is the incumbent in District 5. Both are\nmembers of the Democratic Party; neither is Latino. Adopted Districts 3, 4, and 5 contain\nsubstantially the same geographic areas as under the Current Map and, as a result, protect\nincumbents in those districts. \n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 9 of 55 PageID #:3237\nTo address the Committee’s belief that the Adopted Map unlawfully “packs” Latinos into\nAdopted District 4, thereby diluting the Latino vote in Adopted Districts 3 and 5, the Committee\nproposes  an  alternative  districting  plan  it  calls  “the  Fair  Plan,”  which  we  refer  to  as  the\n“Committee’s Map.”5 In general terms, under the Committee’s Map, District 4 contains the southern\nLatino enclave and the northern portion of Adopted District 3, for a total Latino voting-age\npopulation of 59.4 percent. The Committee’s District 3 includes the northern Latino enclave and\nportions of Adopted District 5, among other districts, for a total Latino voting-age population of 46.5\npercent. District 7 remains a majority-minority African-American district under the Committee’s\nMap. The Latino voting-age population in the Committee’s District 5 is reduced from 24.6 percent\nto 12.4 percent. The Committee’s Map also reduces Latino voting-age population in Districts 6, 7,\nand 9, but such reductions are less than 2 percent. This plan moves Latinos from Adopted District\n4 and gives them another plurality district in the Committee’s District 3. The Committee’s expert,\nDr. Peter Morrison, however, testified that the Committee’s District 3 will not become a majority-\nminority Latino district until after the next census. The Committee’s District 4 fares better under\nboth the Polsby-Popper (.32) and Reock (.47) measures and passes muster under the “eyeball” test\nfor compactness. \nB. Political Gerrymandering Claims: Adopted Districts 11, 13, and 17\nThe racial make-up of the Adopted Map tells only part of the story; political motivations\nwere largely at play in the crafting of the plan. A brief history of the recent political atmosphere in\nIllinois is helpful to understanding the climate in which the Adopted Map arose. From 1997 to 2003,\n5 The Committee’s Map of Cook County and statewide is attached to this opinion as\nAppendix E and F. \n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 10 of 55 PageID #:3238\nthe Illinois General Assembly was divided, with a Democratic majority in the Illinois House of\nRepresentatives and a Republican majority in the Illinois Senate. Since 2003, the Democratic Party\nhas held a majority of seats in the Illinois General Assembly. Today there are 64 Democratic and\n54  Republican  state  representatives  and  35  Democratic  and  24  Republican  state  senators.\nRepublicans held the office of Governor from 1977 to 2003, but Democrats have held it from 2003\nto the present. \nAlthough Illinois in modern times is considered a “blue state” (that is, the Democratic Party\noften fares well in statewide and other elections), congressional representation in recent years has\nbeen divided. From 1999 to 2005, and again from 2011 to the present, Illinois has been represented\nin the United States Senate by one Republican and one Democratic senator (approximately 7 years).\nFrom 1985 to 1999 and from 2005 to 2010, Illinois has had two Democratic senators (approximately\n19 years). \nIn 2000, Illinois had 20 congressional districts (10 Republican, 10 Democratic) and lost one\nseat after the 2000 Census. At the time, Republicans controlled the Illinois Senate and the\nGovernor’s office and Democrats controlled the Illinois House. A compromise map supported by\nleaders from both parties dismantled the 19th congressional district held by then Congressman David\nPhelps (Democrat). In the 2002 congressional elections, Republicans came out ahead, winning 10\nseats to Democrats’ 9.6 Republicans lost seats in two subsequent elections once in 2004 (9\n6 “In Illinois, in 2002, immediately after redistricting, there was only one competitive Congressional\nDistrict. It was the 19th in southern and central Illinois, where two incumbents, Representative John Shimkus\nand Representative David Phelps, were thrown together in a consolidated district. It was a district which by\nmutual agreement between the leaders of the congressional delegation of the two parties, favored the\nRepublicans and Shimkus won handily, as expected.” John S. Jackson & Lourenke Prozensky, Redistricting\nin Illinois (The Simon Review, Occasional Papers of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, Paper 2, 2005),\nhttp://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/ppi_papers/2.\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 11 of 55 PageID #:3239\nRepublicans, 10 Democrats) and again in 2008 (7 Republicans, 12 Democrats), but made a\ncomeback in the 2010 elections, gaining 11 seats to the Democrats’ 8. Illinois again lost a\ncongressional seat after the 2010 Census, and this time the Democratic Governor and Democratic-\ncontrolled  General  Assembly  choose  to  eliminate  the  13th  congressional  district,  held  by\nCongresswoman Judy Biggert (Republican). Evidence indicates that, based on the results of\npresidential elections, the Adopted Map will give the Democrats an advantage in 12 districts and the\nRepublicans an advantage in only 6. Republicans, for obvious reasons, are unhappy with this design. \nThe Redistricting Committees in the 2011 Illinois General Assembly contained members of\nboth major political parties. The House Redistricting Committee had 6 Democratic and 5 Republican\nmembers and the Senate Redistricting Committee had 11 Democratic and 6 Republican members.\nThese committees held a series of public hearings at locations around the state where members of\nthe public were allowed to comment on the redistricting process. See 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 125/10-5.\nIn the morning of May 27, 2011, the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, the Democratic leadership\nof the Illinois House and Senate Redistricting Committees released the Adopted Map to the public\nfor the first time; it was posted on their website. On the following Monday (Memorial Day), the\nIllinois House of Representatives passed the Redistricting Act, and the Illinois Senate followed suit\nthe next day. (It passed along party lines). None of the Republican plaintiffs in this case attended\nthe public hearings nor did they present any plans or suggestions to those committee members\nbecause they considered it futile. In fact, it appears that the Committee’s Map was not disclosed or\nreleased until this litigation was underway. \nPeople outside the Redistricting Committees had significant influence in drawing the\nAdopted Map. Republicans’ attempts to negotiate with these individuals were ineffective because\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 12 of 55 PageID #:3240\nthey were not provided with information needed to properly evaluate the proposed maps. Plaintiff\nCongressman  John  Shimkus  (Republican)  testified  that  he  initially  was  negotiating  with\nCongressman Jerry Costello (Democrat) to craft a bipartisan map but was unable to negotiate any\nfurther when he wasn’t provided shape files (the east-west longitude, block by block, house\ndelineation of the lines) of the proposed maps. Congressman Peter Roskam (Republican) testified\nthat  Illinois  Senate  President  John  Cullerton  (Democrat)  offered  to  negotiate,  but  because\nCongressman Roskam was only provided a glimpse of his proposed district, he declined Illinois\nSenator Cullerton’s offer. \nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) was also heavily involved in\nthe creation of the Adopted Map. Several emails between the DCCC and Andy Manar, chief of staff\nfor Illinois Senator Cullerton, reveal that the primary goal in redistricting was to gain more\nDemocratic  seats.  These  emails  discuss  ideas  about  how  to  make  various  districts  “more\nDemocratic” and achieve the “goal” of “maximiz[ing] Democratic performance.” The partisan\nmotive is most evident in a memo dated May 24, 2011, from the DCCC to Senator Cullerton\ndescribing ways to pick-up Democratic seats, to maximize opportunities for Democrats, to\ndestabilize Republican incumbents, and to gain partisan advantage. This goal was seemingly\naccomplished in Adopted Districts 11, 13, and 17. \nThe Committee, through Edward Marshall, presented evidence of the partisan voting index\n(PVI) for the districts within the Current Map and Adopted Map. PVI is a formula comparing the\nvote in two presidential races within a congressional district to the same two races on a national\nlevel to determine how strongly a congressional district leans toward one political party. The index\nindicates which party’s candidate was more successful in that district, as well as the number of\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 13 of 55 PageID #:3241\npercentage points by which its results differed from the national average. According to Mr.\nMarshall’s figures, under the Current Map, 9 out of the 19 Illinois congressional districts (47.7%)\nhave Democratic-leaning PVI scores, whereas under the Adopted Map, 12 out of the 18 Illinois\ncongressional districts (66.7%) have Democratic-leaning PVI scores. Under the Committee’s Map,\non the other hand, 8 districts would be Democratic-leaning, 8 would be Republican-leaning, and two\nwould be neutral. \nMore specifically, Adopted District 11 has a PVI score of D+5, compared to R+1 in the\nCurrent Map; Adopted District 13 has a PVI score of D+1, compared to R+1 under the Current Map;\nand Adopted District 17 has a PVI score of D+7, compared to D+3 under the Current Map. Mr.\nMarshall also provides evidence of the discrepancy in incumbency protection between Democrats\nand Republicans in the Adopted Map. The Adopted Map preserves from 76.4 percent (Congressman\nLipinksi) to 100 percent (Congressman Costello) of the Democratic incumbents’ constituent\npopulations, whereas it preserves only 20.5 percent (Congressman Adam Kinzinger)7 to 67.9 percent\n(Congressman Aaron Schock) of the Republican incumbents’ constituent populations. \nUnder the Adopted Map: \n! Congressman  Randy  Hultgren  (Republican),  currently  in  District  14,  and\nCongressman Joe Walsh (Republican), currently in District 8, are collapsed into\nAdopted District 14. \n7 Only 1.3 percent of Congresswoman Biggert’s constituents in Current District 13 are placed\nin Adopted District 5, the district in which she resides under the Adopted Map. But because\nCongresswoman Biggert’s district was eliminated, we believe this number is not as representative\nas those cited in the text. \n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 14 of 55 PageID #:3242\n! Congressman Robert Dold (Republican), currently in District 10, is moved into\nDemocratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky’s District 9, which has a PVI score of\nD+15. \n! Congresswoman Judy Biggert (Republican), who currently resides in District 13, will\nnow reside in Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley’s District 5, which has a PVI\nscore of D+16. \n! Congressman Kinzinger (Republican), who currently resides in District 11, will now\nreside in Democratic Congressman Jesse Jackson’s District 2, which has a PVI score\nof D+27. \nAccordingly, the Adopted Map places three Republican incumbents (Dold, Biggert, and Kinzinger)\ninto heavily Democratic districts with a Democratic incumbent and places two other Republican\nincumbents (Hultgren and Walsh) into the same district. \nThe Adopted Map has imperfections. For example, Adopted District 17 links the Quad Cities\nwith the Democratic-leaning parts of Peoria and Rockford, slicing away parts of Republican\nCongressmen Schock’s and Donald Manzullo’s districts and splitting the City of Rockford, which\nhas been within a single district since 1850. Incumbent Congressman Bobby Schilling (Republican)\nremains in District 17 but with only 51.9 percent of his current constituents. Adopted District 11\nzigzags across Chicago’s southwestern suburbs to link Democratic-leaning populations in Aurora\nand Joliet. District 11, which was Congressman Kinzinger’s district, now has no incumbent, and\nKinzinger is moved into Adopted District 2 with only 20.5 percent of his constituents.8 Finally,\n8 That an incumbent need not be a resident of the district to run for election there, see, e.g.,\nTexas Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 590 (5th Cir. 2006), doesn’t change the practical\neffect of redrawing district lines to displace incumbents.\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 15 of 55 PageID #:3243\nAdopted District 13 pulls together Democratic-leaning parts of Springfield, Bloomington/Normal,\nand Champaign/Urbana with Decatur by sending arms off toward the east, north, and northwest. It\nalso  now  includes  parts  of  Collinsville,  a  town  with  22,000  residents  that  will  have  three\ncongressional representatives9 under the Adopted Map.10\nII. Analysis \nThe Committee has asserted claims for racial vote dilution, racial gerrymandering, and\npolitical gerrymandering. We begin by addressing political gerrymandering because we agree that\npolitics was the primary motivating factor behind the Adopted Map.\nA. Political Gerrymandering \nWe  have  already  dismissed,  without  prejudice,  the  Committee’s  claims  of  political\ngerrymandering under the First Amendment (Count V) and the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment (Count VI). We dismissed Count V because the “complaint [did not] make\nplausible a finding that the [Adopted] Map infringes Republican voters’ rights to associate with each\nother or with anyone else, or a finding that the Map burdens Republican voters’ rights of free\nexpression, or that the Map affects Republican voters’ rights to petition the government.” (See\n9 The parties dispute whether residents from one town benefit from having more than one\nrepresentative in the United States House of Representatives. \n10 The Committee’s Map also has imperfections. It would move Congressman Gutierrez into\nLatino plurality District 3, even though he has represented the population in Latino majority District\n4 since 1991. The Committee’s Map would also move Congressman Lipinksi into District 13,\npairing him against Congresswoman Biggert. This would leave Congressman Lipinski with only 4\npercent of the population of his previous District 3, while retaining 67 percent of Congresswoman\nBiggert’s current district. The Committee’s proposed District 13 is Republican leaning (R+2) and\nis projected to result in Congressman Lipinski’s losing his seat in the next election.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 16 of 55 PageID #:3244\nOpinion and Order (Nov. 1, 2011), Dkt. 98, p. 21, 2011 WL 5185567, *11). We held that First\nAmendment rights are not implicated merely because the Adopted Map makes it more difficult for\nRepublican voters to elect Republican candidates. Id., citing Washington v. Finlay, 664 F.2d 913,\n927-28 (4th Cir. 1981) and Radogno v. Illinois State Bd. of Elections, 2011 WL 5025251, *8 (N.D.\nIll. Oct. 21, 2011). We also dismissed Count VI of the Committee’s initial complaint because the\nCommittee had not alleged a standard for judging its equal protection claim as required by Vieth,\n541 U.S. at 306-13 (Kennedy, J., concurring). (See Dkt. 98, pp. 16-20, 2011 WL 5185567, *8-11). \nThe Committee filed an amended complaint again asserting political gerrymandering in\nviolation of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. The amended complaint adds\nallegations of a method by which to measure intent and effect (¶¶ 134, 135)11 and elaborates a bit\non the burden the Map places on Republicans’ ability to have their political views heard. (Am.\nCompl. ¶ 135.) The Board of Elections filed a second motion to dismiss the amended partisan\ngerrymander claims in Counts V and VI [Dkt. No. 122]; we deferred ruling on that motion until after\nthe permanent injunction hearing. We now grant that motion with respect to Count V (the First\nAmendment claim), and deny the motion with respect to Count VI (the Equal Protection partisan\ngerrymander claim). We, however, dismiss Count VI on the merits for failure to substantiate a\nworkable and reliable standard. \nThe First Amendment allegations, which are nothing more than intuitive assumptions, do not\nchange our conclusion, as we stated in the Opinion and Order of November 1, 2011, that the First\nAmendment claim fails because the Committee has not shown that the Adopted Map restricts\nprotected expression. We take guidance from the Vieth plurality, which rejected such a claim,\n11Although  alleged  in  both  the  First  Amendment  and  equal  protection  claims,  these\nallegations pertain only to the equal protection claim.\n16\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 17 of 55 PageID #:3245\nreasoning that “a First Amendment claim [for political gerrymandering], if it were sustained, would\nrender unlawful all consideration of political affiliation in districting, just as it renders unlawful all\nconsideration of political affiliation in hiring for non-policy-level government jobs.” Vieth, 541 U.S.\nat 294 (plurality) (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court has emphasized that the “burdening”\nof partisan viewpoints is an inevitable part of drawing district lines. See Gaffney v. Cummings, 412\nU.S. 735, 753 (1973) (“Politics and political considerations are inseparable from districting and\napportionment. . . . The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial\npolitical consequences.”). The Committee’s First Amendment challenge is similar to the challenge\nrejected by the three-judge panel in League of Women Voters, and following the well reasoned\nopinion in that case, we similarly grant the Board of Elections’ motion to dismiss the Committee’s\nFirst Amendment challenge to the Adopted Map. See League of Women Voters v. Quinn, No. 1:11-\ncv-5569, 2011 WL 5143044, *4 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2011)). As was stated in that case, “[t]he\nredistricting plan [for the General Assembly] does not prevent any LWV member from engaging in\nany political speech, whether that be expressing a political view, endorsing and campaigning for a\ncandidate, contributing to a candidate, or voting for a candidate.” Id. Moreover, “while it is true that\nthe redistricting plan undoubtedly means that one party is more likely to be victorious in any given\ndistrict, the First Amendment . . . ‘does not ensure that all points of view are equally likely to\nprevail.’” Id. (quoting Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1101 (10th Cir.\n2006). Accordingly, we conclude that the Adopted Map does not unlawfully burden the Committee’s\nFirst Amendment rights.\nTurning now to the Committee’s equal protection claim, in ruling on the first motion to\ndismiss we pointed out that the Supreme Court has not agreed on what the elements of such a claim\n17\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 18 of 55 PageID #:3246\nwould be in the context of unlawful discrimination based on partisanship, but we granted leave to\namend if the Committee could “articulate a workable and reliable standard for adjudicating their\npartisan gerrymandering claim and sufficient factual allegations to demonstrate plausibility.” (Dkt.\n98, p. 20, 2011 WL 5185567, *11). \nThe Committee’s amended complaint postulates a standard that requires a showing of both\nintent and effect. To establish the intent element of the proposed standard, the plaintiffs would have\nthe burden to prove that the state’s mapmakers created one or more congressional districts with the\npredominant intent to secure partisan advantage. This intent standard parallels the intent standard\nthat applies to racial gerrymandering claims. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. As the Committee frames\nits issue, proving the required discriminatory effect would require a showing of three things: (1) that\nthe Adopted Map increases the number of districts that favor Democrats by at least 10 percent\naccording to an accepted measure of partisan voting, which the Committee proposes as PVI; (2) that\nthe Adopted Map keeps at least 10 percent more constituents of Democratic incumbents in the same\ndistrict as their representative than it does constituents of Republican incumbents; and (3) that at\nleast one of the districts created with the intent to advantage Democrats is among the districts that\ncontributes to the proof of elements 1 and 2. \n Ultimately, the Committee’s proposed standard is as unworkable as its unworkable\nforebears, recently summarized in Radogno:\n• A showing of intent to discriminate, plus denial of a political group’s chance\nto influence the political process as a whole (offered by the plurality in\nBandemer, 478 U.S. at 132-22 (plurality opinion)) . . . \n• Whether boundaries were drawn for partisan ends to the exclusion of fair,\nneutral factors (offered by Justice Powell’s concurrence in Bandemer, 478\nU.S. at 161, 173 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) . . . .\n18\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 19 of 55 PageID #:3247\n             •  Whether mapmakers acted with the ‘predominant intent’ to achieve partisan\nadvantage and subordinated neutral criteria; for example, where the map\n‘packs’ and ‘cracks’ the rival party’s voters and thwarts its ability to translate\na majority of votes into a majority of seats (offered by the appellants in Vieth,\n[451 U.S.] at 284-90 . . .). \n•  Whether, at a district-to-district level, a district’s lines are so irrational as to\nbe understood only as an effort to discriminate against a political minority\n(offered by Justice Stevens’s dissent in Vieth, id. at 321-27 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) . . . .\n•  Application of a five-part test requiring a plaintiff to show (1) that he is a\nmember of a cohesive political group; (2) that the district of his residence\npaid little or no heed to traditional districting principles; (3) that there were\nspecific  correlations  between  the  district’s  deviations  from  traditional\ndistricting principles and the distribution of the population of his group; (4)\nthat a hypothetical district exists which includes the plaintiff’s residence,\nremedies the ‘packing’ or ‘cracking’ of the plaintiff's group, and deviates less\nfrom traditional districting principles; and (5) that the defendants acted\nintentionally to manipulate the shape of the district in order to pack or crack\nhis group (offered by Justice Souter’s dissent in Vieth, id. at 347-51 (Souter,\nJ., dissenting) . . . .\n•  Whether a statewide plan results in unjustified entrenchment, such that a\nparty’s hold on power is purely the result of partisan manipulation and not\nother factors (offered by Justice Breyer’s dissent in Vieth, id. at 360-62\n(Breyer, J., dissenting) . . . .\n See Radogno, Case No. 1:11-cv-4884, 2011 WL 5868225, *2-3 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 22, 2011) (footnotes\nomitted). \nRejecting these efforts to show intent and/or effect, the Court in Vieth dismissed the\ncomplaint even though the plaintiff had alleged that “the districting plan was created solely to\neffectuate the interests of Republicans, and that the General Assembly relied exclusively on a\nprinciple of maximum partisan advantage when drawing the plan, to the exclusion of all other\ncriteria.” 541 U.S. at 340 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (internal quotations omitted). The plan, according\nto the plaintiff, was “so irregular on its face that it rationally [could] be viewed only as an effort\n19\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 20 of 55 PageID #:3248\n. . . to advance the interests of one political party, without regard for traditional redistricting\nprinciples and without any legitimate or compelling justification.” Id. at 340 (internal quotations\nomitted). Yet, a majority of the Court concluded that these allegations were insufficient to state a\nclaim. \nThe Radogno court further noted that the Supreme Court in League of United Latin Am.\nCitizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 416-20 (2006) (Kennedy, J., announcing the judgment of the Court)\n(LULAC), effectively rejected a standard requiring a showing that the sole intent of the redistricting\nplan was to pursue partisan advantage. See Radogno, 2011 WL 5868225, *3. In LULAC, the Texas\nlegislature engaged in mid-decennial redistricting for the purpose of gaining Republican seats.\nDespite the legislature’s blatant attempt to redistrict for political advantage, Justice Kennedy\nexplained that the sole-motivation theory was unworkable because it failed to “show a burden, as\nmeasured by a reliable standard, on the complainants’ representational rights.” LULAC, 548 U.S.\nat 418.\nThe Supreme Court in Vieth criticized the predominant intent test because “the fact that\npartisan districting is a lawful and common practice means that there is almost always room for an\nelection-impeding lawsuit contending that partisan advantage was the predominant motivation.”\nVieth, 541 U.S. at 286 (emphasis in original). Political considerations are a legitimate consideration\nin redistricting. See Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 551 (1999) (Cromartie I) (parties may engage\nin constitutional political gerrymandering); see also Easley v. Cromartie (Cromartie II), 532 U.S.\n234, 242 (2001) (politics can be a legitimate explanation for districting decisions). At best, “[t]he\nrelevant question is not whether a partisan gerrymander has occurred, but whether it is so excessive\n20\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 21 of 55 PageID #:3249\nor burdensome as to rise to the level of an actionable equal-protection violation.” See Radogno, 2011\nWL 5868225, *2. \nWe agree with the Committee that the predominant intent in drawing several of the districts\nin the Adopted Map was political. DCCC representative Ian Russell sent several emails to Illinois\nSenator  Cullerton’s  chief  of  staff,  Andy  Manar,  discussing  ways  to  improve  Democratic\nperformance in various districts by fashioning district boundaries to pick up areas that are more\nheavily Democratic. This is particularly evident in a memo from the DCCC to Illinois Senator\nCullerton dated May 24, 2011, which acknowledges the goal of creating Democratic-leaning\ndistricts in Illinois. The memo offers suggestions for “increas[ing] our odds of making at least one\nand probably two downstate seats part of a durable majority in the delegation,” including by “pairing\nthe Quad Cities with Peoria.” The DCCC stated that “[a] critical part of the remapping process is\naltering the districts of incumbent Republicans to complicate their paths back to Washington,” and\nproposed “split[ting] Peoria in half, with the Democratic neighborhoods going into a Democratic-\nleaning district that runs north to the Quad Cities” and Peoria-based Congressman Schock going into\na “heavily Republican” district.12 The shape and political demographics of the districts in the\nAdopted Map reveal that the Illinois General Assembly followed DCCC’s guidance. Based on all\nthe evidence presented, we can conclude that politics was the predominant factor in crafting Adopted\nDistricts 11, 13, and 17. \n12 Congressman Donald Manzullo’s testimony before us highlighted that in today’s world,\noverly partisan redistricting resounds beyond the major political parties. Congressman Manzullo\ntestified that members of Congress are prohibited from providing constituent services to non-\nconstituents. Today’s members of Congress often speak for constituents who are having difficulty\nnegotiating dealings with the executive branch. When redistricting constituents are shifted from one\nCongressman to another, they face even more difficulties in finding the new Congressman’s office,\ngetting to that office, and explaining their problems to people who are unfamiliar with them. \n21\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 22 of 55 PageID #:3250\nBut, as indicated, predominant or even sole intent is not enough. The question is whether the\nCommittee’s proposed effects standard is workable. The Committee certainly attempts to heed the\ndirective of the Supreme Court that a workable standard must be one that is objective and\nmeasurable, see Vieth, 541 U.S. at 291, by formulating a standard based on objective measures.\nThere are, however, several fatal flaws with the Committee’s proposed standard.\nUnder the Committee’s proposed standard, the Adopted Map must increase the number of\ndistricts that favor Democrats by at least 10 percent according to an accepted measure of partisan\nvoting, such as the PVI, and must keep at least 10 percent more constituents of Democratic\nincumbents in the same district than it does constituents of Republicans. These 10 percent\nrequirements are inexplicably arbitrary. What accepted principles of equal protection jurisprudence\npoint to the conclusion that 10 percent deviation is the appropriate cut off?  See Radogno, 2011 WL\n5868225, *4 (“[I]t’s hard to see how [the proposed test] is implied by the requirements of the Equal\nProtection Clause, which . . . tolerates some degree of partisanship in redistricting.”). For example,\nwhat if a state has six seats and loses one? That redistricting plan would necessarily increase the\nnumber of districts favoring a political party by more than 10 percent and probably fail the\nCommittee’s test altogether, even though there is nothing unconstitutional about considering politics\nwhen redrawing district lines. Additionally, from what point in time is the 10 percent increase in\nDemocratic-leaning districts to be measured? As illustrated by the partisan fluctuations in Illinois’\ncongressional delegation, Republicans performed exceptionally well in the 2010 elections, but their\naverage performance over the past ten years is less remarkable. \nFurther, the Committee uses the PVI to determine which districts “favor” Democrats under\nthe Adopted Map. This standard, however, does not reveal excessive political gerrymandering\n22\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 23 of 55 PageID #:3251\nbecause it might include districts that favor the political party by only a slight margin. Adopted\nDistrict 13 illustrates this point. District 13 had only a slight change in PVI score: Current Map\nDistrict 13 had a PVI score of R+1 and the Adopted Map has a PVI score of D+1. (Interestingly,\nAdopted District 17 is not even Republican leaning according to the PVI: Current Map District 17\nhad a PVI score of D+3 and Adopted District 17 has a PVI score of D+7). Reliance on the\nCommittee’s standard in such circumstances does not reveal political gerrymandering gone too far. \nBoth prongs of the effects test also fail to acknowledge that “a person’s politics is rarely as\nreadily discernible—and never as permanently discernible—as a person’s race,” and that “[p]olitical\naffiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and even\nwithin a given election, not all voters follow the party line.” Vieth, 541 U.S. at 287 (emphasis in\noriginal). The plurality in Vieth concluded that such “facts make it impossible to assess the effects\nof partisan gerrymandering.” Id. The Committee’s use of PVI doesn’t address this concern; a\nmeasurement based on presidential elections is not necessarily telling of a district’s political sway\nin future congressional elections. This is particularly true in Illinois where voters have not\nconsistently favored one political party. The 12 to 6 Democratic advantage predicted for the Adopted\nMap isn’t as jarring when considered in light of Democrats’ 12 to 7 edge over Republicans after the\n2008 elections. Further, according to the PVI, Democrats were favored to win in District 17 and\nDistrict 10 prior to the 2010 midterms (the PVI score for Current Map District 17 was D+3 and\nCurrent Map District 10 was D+6), yet Republicans won both those seats. Conversely, despite large\ncongressional pick ups for Republicans in 2010 and the Republican win in the U.S. Senate race, the\nIllinois gubernatorial race in that same election resulted in a victory for incumbent Governor Pat\n23\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 24 of 55 PageID #:3252\nQuinn, a Democrat,13 although the margin of victory was slim. Given the unpredictable nature of\nIllinois voters’ political preference, the PVI is not a particularly reliable measure of partisan voting\nin congressional elections.\nThe Committee’s proposed standard is not so dissimilar from the effects test rejected in Vieth\nthat required plaintiffs to “show that the districts systematically ‘pack’ and ‘crack’14 the rival party’s\nvoters” and thwart its ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats. See Vieth, 541\nU.S. at 286. The Court questioned whether this standard was “judicially discernible in the sense of\nbeing relevant to some constitutional violation” because groups do not have a right to proportional\nrepresentation. Id. at 287-88; see also id. at 299-300 (rejecting Justice Breyer’s standard that partisan\ngerrymandering can be shown where the party receiving the majority of votes fails to acquire a\nmajority of seats in two successive elections and where there is no “neutral” explanation). \nWe similarly find that the Committee’s standard is not judicially discernible as relevant to\na constitutional violation. It could result in the finding of an equal protection violation where\nRepublicans still remain competitive in the district that was created with the intent to advantage\nDemocrats (for example, a district that goes from 51 to 49 percent Republican-leaning). The\nCommittee’s standard requires that only one of the districts created with the intent to advantage\nDemocrats be among the ones that contribute to the 10 percent deviations. The Republicans’\nrepresentational rights are not unfairly burdened where they remain competitive in a district,\n13Gov. Quinn’s incumbency was the result of the impeachment of his predecessor, Rod\nBlagojevich. Mr. Quinn was elected Lt. Governor in 2002, was re-elected to that office in 2006, and\nas a matter of Illinois law became Governor upon Blagojevich’s impeachment in January 2009. \n14 “‘Packing’ refers to the practice of filling a district with a supermajority of a given group\nor party. ‘Cracking’ involves the splitting of a group or party among several districts to deny that\ngroup or party a majority in any of those districts.” Id. at 287 n.7. \n24\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 25 of 55 PageID #:3253\nparticularly if traditional redistricting principles contributed in part to the district’s boundaries. The\nCommittee’s effects test simply doesn’t provide a workable standard to determine when partisan\ngerrymandering has become unconstitutionally excessive. See, e.g., Radogno, 2011 WL 5868225,\n*5 (stating that “the challenge is to locate a standard that identifies unconstitutionally excessive\npartisan discrimination”; “the Plaintiffs have not proposed such a standard, nor can we identify\none.”) (emphasis in original). For all of these reasons, we reject the Committee’s claims that partisan\ngerrymandering violates its constitutional rights.\nB. Vote Dilution \nThe plaintiffs also allege in their amended complaint that the congressional redistricting plan\nadopted by the State of Illinois dilutes the vote of Latinos in Districts 3, 4, and 5, in violation of\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act (Count I), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment (Count II), and rights protected by the Fifteenth Amendment (Count III). We begin by\naddressing Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, but our conclusion that the Committee hasn’t shown\nintentional discrimination against Latinos dooms all three vote dilution counts. \nWe have already addressed the standards for these claims in our opinion on the first motion\nto dismiss, but for clarity, we summarize those standards here. For purposes of Section 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act, vote dilution is the practice of reducing the potential effectiveness of a group’s\nvoting strength by limiting the group’s chances to translate that strength into voting power. See, e.g.,\nShaw I, 509 U.S. at 641. Vote dilution most often is attempted either by scattering the minority\nvoters among several districts in which a bloc-voting majority can outvote them regularly, or by\ncentralizing them into one or two districts and leaving the other districts relatively free from their\ninfluence. See Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1007 (1994). Intentional vote dilution through\n25\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 26 of 55 PageID #:3254\nthe drawing of district lines violates both Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth\nAmendment, see Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 617 (1982), and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\nalso forbids facially neutral districting that has the effect of diluting minority votes, 42 U.S.C. §\n1973. \nSection 2 provides that “[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,\npractice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State . . . in a manner which results in a\ndenial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor . . . as provided in subsection (b) of this section.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a). Subsection (b) provides\nthat a violation of subsection (a) “is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown\nthat the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State . . . are not equally open\nto participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\nits members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political\nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b). The 1982 amendments\nto this statute eliminated the requirement of intentional discrimination by substituting a “results” test\nfor the “purpose” test previously imposed by the Supreme Court. See Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d\n1398, 1403 (7th Cir. 1984). \nGenerally, the Committee must prove three preconditions to succeed on a Section 2 claim:\n(1) that Latinos are a large enough group and geographically compact enough to be a majority in a\nsingle-member district, or in more single-member districts than the redistricting plan created; (2) that\nthe Latino group is “politically cohesive,” meaning that its members vote in a similar fashion; and\n(3) the majority votes as a bloc, allowing them usually to defeat the Latino’s preferred candidates.\nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 48-51 (1986). If the plaintiffs satisfy their burden of proving\n26\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 27 of 55 PageID #:3255\nthose conditions, the court moves on to decide, based on the totality of the circumstances, whether\na Section 2 violation has occurred, see De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1011, considering (among other\nthings) the state’s history of voting-related discrimination, the degree of racial polarization in voting,\nand whether and how the state has used voting practices or procedures that facilitate discrimination\nagainst the plaintiffs’ minority group, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44-45.\nThe Committee has not proved the first Gingles precondition that the Latino minority group\nis large enough and geographically compact enough to be a majority in more single-member districts\nthan the redistricting plan created. The Committee’s Map does not create two majority-minority\nLatino districts. District 4 under the  Committee’s Map has 59.4 percent Latino voting-age\npopulation and District 3 has only 46.5 percent. See Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 129 S. Ct.\n1231, 1246 (2009) (holding “that a party asserting § 2 liability must show by a preponderance of the\nevidence that the minority population in the potential election district is greater than 50 percent.”). \nAs we explained in our opinion on the first motion to dismiss, however, if the Committee\nshows intentional discrimination, the first Gingles factor is relaxed. (See Dkt. 98, pp. 5-8, 2011 WL\n5185567, *3-4).15 But, following the Ninth and Eleventh circuits, we stated that without effect,\ndiscriminatory intent will not carry the day. See Garza v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 771\n(9th Cir. 1990) (“Although the showing of injury in cases involving discriminatory intent need not\n15 The Court in Bartlett limited its holding by noting that the case did not involve allegations of\nintentional and wrongful conduct, and therefore, the Court did not need to resolve “whether intentional\ndiscrimination affects the Gingles analysis.” 129 S. Ct. at 1246 (Kennedy, J., plurality). The Court expressly\nstated that its holding in that case “does not apply to cases in which there is intentional discrimination against\na racial minority.” Id.; see also Baird v. Consol. City of Indianapolis, 976 F.2d 357, 359 (7th Cir. 1992)\n(implying that intentional discrimination under Section 2(a) doesn’t require the same analysis as an effects-\nbased claim under Section 2(b)); see also Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 158 (1993) (stating that “the\nGingles factors cannot be applied mechanically and without regard to the nature of the claim”). \n27\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 28 of 55 PageID #:3256\nbe as rigorous as in effects cases, some showing of injury must be made to assure that the district\ncourt can impose a meaningful remedy.”) (emphasis in original); see also Johnson v. DeSoto Cnty.\nBd. of Comm’r, 72 F.3d 1556, 1561-63 (11th Cir. 1996) (stating that Section 2 “expressly requires\na showing of discriminatory results, and it admits of no exception for situations in which there is\ndiscriminatory intent but no discriminatory results”). Accordingly, we explained that the Committee\nwould still have to show that the Adopted Map lessened the opportunity for Latino voters to elect\na candidate of their choice in the challenged district and that the second and third Gingles\npreconditions are established – that the minority group is politically cohesive and that the majority\nvotes as a bloc, allowing the majority voters usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidates.\nSee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. \nFailing proof of the first Gingles factor, the Committee may show discriminatory effect\nthrough circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent. See Ketchum, 740 F.2d at 1406; Johnson\nat 1565 (intent to discriminate is circumstantial evidence of discriminatory results that should be\nconsidered in assessing the totality of circumstances). As we stated in our opinion on discovery-\nrelated matters (Opinion and Order, Dkt. 77, pp. 7-8 (Oct. 12, 2011), 2011 WL 4837508, *3), such\nfactors include, but are not limited to, bloc voting along racial lines; low minority voter registration;\nexclusion from the political process; unresponsiveness of elected officials to needs of minorities;\nand depressed socio-economic status attributable to inferior education and employment and housing\ndiscrimination. See Ketchum, 749 F.2d at 1406 (citing Rogers, 458 U.S. at 622-27). Other factors\ninclude the historical background of the decision; the specific sequence of events leading up to the\nchallenged decision; departures from the normal procedural sequence; minority retrogression (i.e.,\na decrease in the voting strength of a cohesive voting bloc over time); and manipulation of district\n28\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 29 of 55 PageID #:3257\nboundaries to adjust the relative size of minority groups, including the “packing” of minority votes.\nSee Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267-68 (1977)); see also\nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 426 (citing relevant factors under Section 2's “totality of circumstances” test).\nYet “[a]nother relevant consideration is whether the number of districts in which the minority group\nforms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in the relevant\narea.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at 426. The court may infer an “invidious discriminatory purpose . . . from\nthe totality of the relevant facts,” including the discriminatory effect of the redistricting scheme.\nRogers, 458 U.S. at 618. \nThe Committee presented no direct evidence of discriminatory intent, so we turn to the\ntotality of the circumstances. The Committee focuses primarily on how the district boundaries are\ndrawn, asserting that the Adopted Map packs a supermajority of Latinos in District 4 so that the\nvotes of Latinos inside the district are “wasted” and the Latino votes in Districts 3 and 5 are diluted.\nAs explained above, the Hastert court created District 4 with 59.2 percent Latino voting-age\npopulation to remedy a Section 2 Voting Rights Act violation. Since the creation of District 4,\nLatino Congressman Gutierrez has won District 4 by large margins and ran unopposed in the last\nfour primaries. As a rule of thumb, “because of both age and the percentage of noncitizens, Latinos\nmust be 65 to 70 percent of the total population in order to be confident of electing a Latino.”\nBarnett v. City of Chi., 141 F.3d 699, 703 (7th Cir. 1998). When considering voting-age population,\nthe rule of thumb is closer to 60 percent. See Ketchum, 740 F.2d at 1415 (stating that 60 percent of\nvoting-age population is reasonably required to ensure minorities a fair opportunity to elect a\ncandidate of their choice). As the Committee correctly points out, however, this is merely a rule of\n29\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 30 of 55 PageID #:3258\nthumb and “should be reconsidered regularly to reflect new information and new statistical data.”\nKetchum, 740 F.2d at 1416. \nThe Board of Elections’ expert does not suggest that the 59.4 percent voting-age population\nfor District 4 in the Committee’s Map is insufficient to elect a Latino candidate. This percentage was\nenough when District 4 was first created to constitute an effective majority-minority district and\nresulted in Congressman Gutierrez winning the 1992 Democratic primary election against Latino\nJuan Soliz and going on to win the general election with 78 percent of the vote. But, given the rule\nof thumb, and the need to account for Latinos within the voting-age population who are not citizens\neligible to vote, we do not infer that 65.9 percent voting-age population of Latinos in Adopted\nDistrict 4 suggests excessive packing. See id. at 1415 n.19 (noting that a district court may consider\nan appropriate corrective for non-citizenship).16\nA review of the actual boundaries of Adopted District 4 is more telling of the state’s intent.\nAt the time of the 2010 Census the percentage of Latino voting-age population in District 4 stood\nat 68.1 percent. Adopted District 4 reduces that by 2.2 percent even though, according to the Board\nof Elections’ expert, Dr. Allan Lichtman, the state could have further increased the Latino voting-\nage population to 68.4 percent by merely keeping certain high concentration Latino areas that were\nin Current District 4 and not bringing in equivalent low Latino voting-age population areas from\nother districts. We acknowledge that doing so may have required changes to District 3 or 7, but it\nwas nonetheless an available option. The addition of low Latino voting-age population areas to\nDistrict 4 and exclusion of certain high voting-age population areas suggests that the state’s intent\nwas not maximization of Latino voting-age population. \n16 We also note that the Adopted Map’s 65.9 percent is only about 5 percent higher than the\npercentage proposed in the Committee’s Map.\n30\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 31 of 55 PageID #:3259\nThe boundaries of Adopted District 4 also evidence an intent to keep Latino communities\nof interest in the northern and southern enclaves within the same district. Latino plaintiffs in this\naction testified that Latinos have a common heritage and share common core values. The court in\nHastert found that the two separate Latino enclaves are less than a mile from each other at their\nclosest points and that the communities are not distinct, but compact. Hastert, 777 F. Supp. at 649.\nThe Committee’s expert, Dr. Morrison, opined that the state could have retained the shape of District\n4 and reduced the Latino voting-age population by making more ethnically neutral territorial trades.\nHe concluded that the state added territory with a 47.2 percent Latino voting-age population, while\nremoving territory formerly in District 4 that had a 40.6 percent Latino voting-age population. If the\nstate had been ethnically neutral in adding and subtracting Latino territory, the Latino voting-age\npopulation in District 4 would have been reduced by approximately 2 percent. The Committee,\nhowever, wasn’t able to present evidence that an ethnically neutral exchange was feasible given the\none-person, one-vote rule and, considering that the difference is minimal, we do not infer from this\nevidence an intent to pack Latinos into District 4 for the purpose of diluting their vote.\nFurther, as the Committee itself argues, the Adopted Map was drawn for predominantly\npolitical reasons, and we believe this is evident in Adopted Districts 3, 4 and 5. Maintaining\nsubstantially the same boundaries of District 4 allows Congressman Gutierrez to remain in a district\nwith 82.3 percent of his current constituents. This in turn allowed the Democrats to draw Districts\n3 and 5 with substantially the same boundaries, resulting in Congressman Lipinski’s remaining in\na district with 76.4 percent of his constituents and Congressman Quigley in a district with 78.9\npercent of his constituents.17\n17 In contrast, the Committee’s Map would move Congressman Gutierrez to District 3 with\nonly 41.5 percent of his constituents, Congressman Lipinski would move to District 13 with only\n31\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 32 of 55 PageID #:3260\nThe Committee contends that Congressman Gutierrez would likely win in its proposed\nDistrict 3 because his support has been overwhelming, and thus, he needs no incumbency protection.\nIf the Committee’s expert, Dr. Richard Engstrom, is correct, however, that there is polarized voting\nin the Committee’s proposed District 3, whether Congressman Gutierrez would succeed in that\ndistrict may depend on who runs against him in the primary. Congressman Gutierrez could also run\nin the Committee’s proposed District 4 even though he doesn’t reside there, and he would likely win\nthat election. LULAC, however, teaches us that incumbency protection can take many forms, one\nof which is to keep the constituency intact so the officeholder is accountable for promises made or\nbroken. 548 U.S. at 440-41. Maintaining incumbent-constituent relationships is a legitimate\nredistricting goal and breaking up the northern and southern enclaves into different districts splits\nup Congressman Gutierrez’s constituents and divides a community of interest. \n Citing Larios v. Cox, 300 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1347 (N.D. Ga. 2004), summarily aff’d, 542\nU.S. 947, the Committee argues that the Democrats’ selective incumbency protection – the Adopted\nMap does not protect Republican incumbents – cannot be a legislative redistricting principle. Larios\nis inapposite because it involves the one-person, one-vote requirement of the Equal Protection\nClause, not racial vote dilution. As the court in Larios stated, “[d]eviations from exact population\nequality may be allowed in some instances in order to further legitimate state interests,” id. at 1337,\nbut found that “the creation of population deviations to protect [Democratic] incumbents . . . [did]\nnot qualify as a legitimate state policy,” in part, because it “was not applied in a consistent and\nneutral way,” id. at 1347. In this case, there has been no assertion that the Adopted Map violates the\n3.5 percent of his constituents, and Congressman Quigley would stay in District 5, but with only\n50.1 percent of his constituents. The fate that awaits Congresswoman Biggert under the Adopted\nMap would belong to Congressman Lipinski instead under the Committee’s Map. \n32\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 33 of 55 PageID #:3261\none-person, one-vote requirement. The issue is whether District 4 was drawn to intentionally\ndiscriminate against Latinos. If the Democrats in the Illinois General Assembly crafted Adopted\nDistrict 4 for reasons other than discriminatory intent, whether those reasons are legitimate state\ninterests or not, the Committee cannot succeed. \nThe parties’ experts agree that Latinos in Cook County overwhelmingly vote Democratic,\nso there is no reason that the Democrats would want to dilute the vote of Latinos, at least not in the\ngeneral elections. The Committee, however, asserts that because Districts 3, 4, and 5 are safely\nDemocratic, the elections that count are the primaries. The Committee contends that the Democrats\nwant to keep Latinos out of District 3 to preserve Congressman Lipinski’s primary win because he\nhas recently lost favor among Latinos on account of his stance on immigration. The state cannot\ndraw district lines to exclude minorities merely because they might oppose an incumbent. See\nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 440-41. \nTo support its position, the Committee offers a news article from Illinois Coalition for\nImmigrant and Refugee Rights dated January 31, 2008, titled Congressman Luis Gutierrez\nWithdraws his Endorsement of Congressman Lipinski. Apart from the minimal evidentiary value of\nsuch a document, if any,18 the argument is unpersuasive. The Latino voting-age population in\nAdopted District 3 only decreased by 4.7 percent (from 29.3 to 24.6 percent) from the Current Map\nto the Adopted Map. Given that the Latino voting-age population in Cook County has nearly\ndoubled since 1990 and is projected to continue increasing steadily, a 4.7 percent reduction in Latino\nvoting-age population in Adopted District 3 doesn’t notably reduce the opportunity for a Latino\n18Although we denied the Board of Elections’ motion in limine to exclude this evidence at\ntrial (Dkt. 140, p. 4 (Nov. 16, 2011)), we see now that the document was used solely for the truth\nof the matter asserted and is unexceptionable hearsay.\n33\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 34 of 55 PageID #:3262\ncandidate of choice to successfully run against Congressman Lipinski in the Democratic primary\nover the next decade. Additionally, the Committee presented little evidence, and certainly nothing\nconvincing, that Latino voters in District 3 disfavor Congressman Lipinski. For example, the\nCommittee did not offer Congressman Lipinski’s voting record on issues important to Latinos, or\npresent examples of Latino organizations opposing his reelection.  \nFurther, the Committee does not dispute Dr. Lichtman’s findings that in the 2010 primary\nelection Congressman Lipinski received 57 percent of the Latino vote when running against a Latino\ncandidate. Dr. Engstrom testified that he did not consider this election in his analysis of polarized\nvoting because the losing Latino candidate only garnered 22 percent of the vote in a two-person\nelection and, thus, was “non-competitive.” This election result, nonetheless, supports a finding that\nCongressman Lipinski faces little threat of defection by Latinos in his district. \nThe Committee also presented evidence of emails in which Congressman Lipinski proposed\ndistrict lines for District 3, noting the total population, Democratic performance, Latino voting-age\npopulation, African-American voting-age population, and overall African-American population.\nThis does not point to intentional discrimination where the Supreme Court has stated that legislators\ncan be race-conscious when redistricting. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 916 (“Redistricting legislatures\nwill, for example, almost always be aware of racial demographics; but it does not follow that race\npredominates in the redistricting process.”); Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 646 (“[R]edistricting differs from\nother kinds of state decisionmaking in that the legislature always is aware of race when it draws\ndistrict lines, just as it is aware of . . . other demographic factors. That sort of race consciousness\ndoes not lead inevitably to impermissible race discrimination.”) (emphasis in original); Bush, 517\nU.S. at 1001 (Thomas, J., concurring) (“We have said that impermissible racial classifications do\n34\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 35 of 55 PageID #:3263\nnot follow inevitably from a legislature’s mere awareness of racial demographics.”). The emails\nintroduced by the Committee merely show that Congressman Lipinski was conscious of his\nproposed district’s demographics, not that he sought to exclude Latino voters. \nIn the Adopted Map, Latinos have one majority-minority district (District 4) and three other\ndistricts with a Latino voting-age population of 20 percent or more (District 3 with 24.6 percent,\nDistrict 8 with 22.1 percent, and District 11 with 21.8 percent). The Adopted Map increases the\nLatino population in District 8 by 8 percent and District 11 by 12 percent. Although the Adopted\nMap does not ensure that Latino voters have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice in\nDistricts 3, 8 and 11, it does provide them with the potential to have an influence in those districts.19 \nIn looking at the totality of circumstances, we also consider “whether the number of districts\nin which the minority group forms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the\npopulation in the relevant area.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at 426. We stated in our opinion on the first\nmotion to dismiss that “the more appropriate inquiry in this case for the proportionality factor, which\nis analyzed on a statewide basis, is citizen voting-age population.” (Dkt. 98, p. 20, 2011 WL\n5185567, *5); see also Barnett, 141 F.3d at 705 (“[T]he proper benchmark for measuring\nproportionality is citizen voting-age population.” ); see also LULAC, 548 U.S. at 436 (relying on\ncitizen voting-age population when determining proportionality). We recognized that it might be\n19Although the Committee’s Map would increase the Latino voting-age population in District\n3, it would reduce the Latino voting-age population in District 5 from 24.56 to 12.35 percent. Under\nthe Committee’s Map, Latinos would have one majority-minority district (District 4) and one\nplurality district (District 3); only two districts where Latinos have any real influence. It also\nchanges Districts 8 and 11 from Democrat-leaning districts to districts where a Republican is\nfavored to win. We cannot fail to acknowledge that the Committee’s Map favors Republicans when\ncompared to the Adopted Map. Because the Latino population in Chicago generally favors\nDemocratic candidates, such a plan, even with a strong Latino plurality district, may not be to the\nLatinos’ advantage as the Latino voters of Illinois understand their interests today. \n35\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 36 of 55 PageID #:3264\ndifficult for the Committee to make this showing because the 2010 Census does not include\ncitizenship, but we indicated that the parties could rely on expert testimony. \nDr. Lichtman testified about citizen voting-age population on a statewide basis derived from\nthe American Community Survey (ACS). ACS is an ongoing survey organized by the U.S. Census\nBureau that randomly solicits data from people in every state throughout the year. Dr. Morrison\nlodged several criticisms of reliance on ACS data. For example, he noted that ACS data only provide\nestimates of citizenship based on population samples, rather than actual enumeration as with census\nresults. ACS data are also not publicly available at the smallest units of geography as are used in\nredistricting. He testified, however, that the data were “okay from a scientific standpoint for\nmeasuring citizenship at . . the state level.” \nBecause rough proportionality under the totality of circumstances test looks to citizen voting-\nage population at the statewide level, we find that ACS figures are reliable for this purpose. Dr.\nLichtman explained in his report that “[t]he United States Bureau of Census released in late\nSeptember its 2010 data on citizenship status, based on its American Community Survey. . . . Based\non this data the percentage of Latinos in the citizen voting age population in Illinois is 8.7 percent.\nMultiplied by 18 Congressional districts this percentage equals 1.57 [Latino] Congressional districts\n. . . .” Dr. Lichtman noted that “[w]hile the ACS citizenship data are based on samples, and not\nenumeration, so was the Census citizenship data.” Because these figures are for the state overall,\nthey do “not require the measurement of citizenship at lower levels of Census geography.” Dr.\nLichtman testified that even though these data are derived from samples they are accurate on a\nstatewide level within a few tenths of a percentage point.\n36\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 37 of 55 PageID #:3265\nWe find, therefore, that the number of districts in which Latino voters form an effective\nmajority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in Illinois. According to ACS figures,\n1.57 districts should be Latino majority-minority districts. Although only one district is majority\nLatino under the Adopted Map, the variance is not so significant as to support a finding of\nintentional discrimination against Latinos. \nNeither do other relevant factors point to intentional discrimination against Latinos. Evidence\nthat the redistricting process was “secretive” and excluded Republicans reveals partisan motivation,\nnot racial discrimination. For purposes of this analysis, we will assume that there is polarized voting\nbetween Latinos and the majority voting bloc in the challenged districts. (More on this later). We\nalso note the history of discrimination against Latinos, see Hastert, 777 F. Supp. at 650 (finding a\ndefinite pattern and practice of electoral discrimination against the Hispanic community in Chicago);\nsee also Barnett, 141 F.3d at 702 (noting that voting for alderman in Chicago is polarized and\n“Latinos are almost never elected in wards that do not contain a Latino majority of citizens of voting\nage.”), and socioeconomic disparities among the Latino community, see 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. 3983/5\n(“Latinos lag behind in major indicators of well-being relative to education, health, employment,\nand child welfare, as well as representation throughout the State.”); see also Pl. Ex. A53 at 8\n(“Latinos had lower family incomes than any other major racial or ethnic group in the Chicago\nregion in . . . 2006.”). None of these factors, however, leads to the conclusion that Democrats in the\nIllinois General Assembly intended to discriminate against Latinos. \nThe Board of Elections presented evidence that all Latinos in the General Assembly voted\nfor the plan and that no Latino advocacy or citizen group has expressed opposition to the Adopted\nMap. Latinos have also increasingly been elected to public office in Cook County. The Board of\n37\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 38 of 55 PageID #:3266\nElections points out that since the last redistricting, Latinos have been elected to the offices of Cook\nCounty State’s Attorney, Cook County Assessor, and Chicago City Clerk. Latino candidates in Cook\nCounty have also been elected to the Illinois House and Senate. According to a survey by the\nNational Association of Latino Elected officials, 113 Latinos were serving in elected office in\nIllinois in 2010, placing the state seventh in the nation (tied with New Jersey). This represents a 176\npercent increase in Latinos holding office in Illinois since 1996. \nAfter considering all the relevant factors, we find that Illinois lawmakers in passing the\nAdopted Map did not act with the intent to discriminate against Latinos. This finding not only\nrequires dismissal of the Committee’s Section 2 claim (Count I), but also its Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendment vote dilution claims (Counts II and III). See Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd.,\n520 U.S. 471, 481 (1997) (“Since 1980, a plaintiff bringing a constitutional vote dilution challenge,\nwhether under the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, has been required to establish that the state\nor political subdivision acted with a discriminatory purpose.”).\nBecause we find no intentional discrimination and the Committee cannot show that the first\nGingles precondition is met, we could end our discussion here. For completeness, however, we find\nthat even if the Committee could show intentional discrimination, it has not presented sufficient\nevidence to show that the third Gingles precondition is met – that the majority votes as bloc,\nallowing them usually to defeat the Latino’s preferred candidates. To prove this, the Committee\npresented expert analysis of Dr. Engstrom. We are not persuaded by his findings for several reasons.\nFirst, Dr. Engstrom only considered Adopted District 4 and the Committee’s proposed Districts 3\nand 5. His area of interest was limited and excluded portions of Adopted Districts 3 and 5, districts\nthat were challenged by the Committee. The Gingles analysis requires a finding that there is\n38\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 39 of 55 PageID #:3267\npolarized voting in the challenged districts. See, e.g., Radogno, No. 1:11-cv-4884, Opinion and\nOrder (Dec. 7, 2011), pp. 19-20 (“[E]lection data relating to House District 23 as it existed in 2010\n(i.e., under the previous map) is irrelevant to plaintiffs’ claim against RD 23 under the 2011 map .\n. . .”).  When examining evidence to determine polarized voting on a district-specific basis, we are\nnot confined to elections solely within the district but can consider those in surrounding districts to\ndetermine voting patterns relevant to the challenged area. See, e.g., Baird v. Consolidated City of\nIndianapolis, 976 F.2d 357, 360 (7th Cir. 1992). While we acknowledge that Dr. Engstrom’s area\nof concern partially overlaps with the challenged districts and is relevant in considering polarized\nvoting in the challenged area, we find that his confined area of analysis resulted in too narrow a\nscope of review. \nWe are unpersuaded by the elections Dr. Engstrom chose to consider. Dr. Engstrom analyzed\nfourteen elections, but two of those elections weren’t incorporated into his report. Of the twelve that\nwere incorporated, half were judicial elections. Four of the elections were judicial sub-circuit\nelections, which we don’t find particularly probative. He only analyzed one legislative election\n(2010 Cook County Board of Commissioners election), but no congressional elections, state senate,\nor state representative elections. Dr. Engstrom further confined his analysis by excluding elections\nhe considered “non-competitive.” For example, he excluded the 2010 primary for District 3 (where\nCongressman Lipinksi ran against a Latino candidate and won) because he believed the Latino\ncandidate wasn’t competitive (he only received 22 percent of the vote). We, however, find this\nelection more probative than sub-circuit judicial elections that were included. \nThe more significant problem with Dr. Engstrom’s analysis is that he didn’t examine actual\nelection results to evaluate whether non-Latinos vote as a bloc to usually defeat the Latinos’\n39\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 40 of 55 PageID #:3268\ncandidate of choice. As correctly noted by Dr. Lichtman, proof of vote dilution requires two steps.\nThe Committee must first show that Latinos and non-Latinos prefer different candidates, and second,\nthat the non-Latino voting bloc is sufficiently strong to usually defeat the Latino candidate of choice.\nDr. Engstrom fails to make a showing as to this latter requirement. His report, for example, ignores\nelection results that Dr. Lichtman included in his report where Latino candidates of choice won in\n15 out of 16 elections in jurisdictions that were 70 percent or more non-Latino in their voting age\npopulation, a success rate of 94 percent. When considering the elections included in Dr. Engstrom’s\nand Dr. Lichtman’s reports, Latino candidates of choice prevailed in 24 of 29 elections, a success\nrate of 83 percent. Dr. Lichtman’s findings show that as a “practical,” rather than theoretical, matter,\nLatino candidates have won more often than not in the challenged area. \nWhile Dr. Lichtman’s assessment of the third Gingles prong is also subject to criticism, we\ndo not need to decide the validity of his assessment because it is the Committee’s burden to prove\nthe Gingles preconditions. Dr. Engstrom’s analysis, which doesn’t analyze actual election results,\nis insufficient  to meet this burden. See, e.g., Radogno, No. 1:11-cv-4884, Opinion and Order (Dec.\n7, 2011), pp. 20 (finding that the expert’s analysis was flawed where he ignored actual election\nresults and instead based his findings on a showing that white candidates, as a group, would have\nwon the election if, “you aggregate all votes for a particular ethnicity.”).\nC. Racial Gerrymandering\nTo succeed on their racial gerrymander claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Committee must show that race was the predominant factor in creating\nAdopted District 4. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. When race is the predominant consideration in drawing\n40\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 41 of 55 PageID #:3269\ndistrict lines such that the legislature subordinated race-neutral districting principles to racial\nconsiderations, strict scrutiny applies. Id. at 920. “Strict scrutiny applies where redistricting\nlegislation . . . is so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort\nto segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles,\n . . . or where race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature’s\ndominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.” Bush, 517 U.S. at 958 (internal\nquotations and citation omitted). In other words, for strict scrutiny to apply, traditional districting\ncriteria, such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions or communities\ndefined by actual shared interests, must be subordinated to race. Id. at 959 & 963; see also id. at\n993-94 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“States may intentionally create majority-minority districts, and\nmay otherwise take race into consideration, without coming under strict scrutiny. Only if traditional\ndistricting criteria are neglected and that neglect is predominately due to the misuse of race does\nstrict scrutiny apply.”).\nThe shape of a district “is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary element of . . .\nproof, but because it may be persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not\nother districting principles, was the legislature’s dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its\ndistrict lines.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 913. The Court has found significant a district’s highly irregular\nand geographically non-compact shape in finding that racial motivations predominated in drawing\ndistrict boundaries. Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 905-06. If a district’s shape alone does not make out a\nstrong circumstantial case, racial gerrymandering may be revealed more clearly when its shape is\nlinked to demographics and other factors. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 917 (“Although by comparison\nwith other districts the geometric shape of the Eleventh District may not seem bizarre on its face,\n41\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 42 of 55 PageID #:3270\nwhen its shape is considered in conjunction with its racial and population densities, the story of\nracial gerrymandering seen by the District Court becomes much clearer.”).\nCourts must “exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn\ndistrict lines on the basis of race.” Id. at 916. “[C]aution is especially appropriate . . . where the State\nhas articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision, and the voting\npopulation is one in which race and political affiliation are highly correlated.” Cromartie II, 532\nU.S. at 242. The Supreme Court in Cromartie II articulated the burden that parties attacking\nredistricting boundaries must meet in cases where race correlates with political affiliation:\nIn a case such as this one where majority-minority districts (or the approximate\nequivalent) are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political\naffiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the\nleast that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in\nalternative  ways  that  are  comparably  consistent  with  traditional  redistricting\nprinciples. The party must also show that those districting alternatives would have\nbrought about significantly greater racial balance. \nId. at 258; see also id. at 238-40, 257-58 (concluding that an “unusually shaped” “snakelike” district\npassed muster under the Equal Protection Clause because other evidence in the case tended to\nsupport the conclusion that politics, not race, predominated.”); Bush, 517 U.S. at 968 (“If district\nlines merely correlate with race because they are drawn on the basis of political affiliation, which\ncorrelates with race, there is no racial classification to justify.”). As noted above, incumbency\nprotection can be a legitimate factor in districting where the justification is to keep the constituency\nintact so the officeholder is accountable for promises made or broken, see LULAC, 548 U.S. at\n440-41, but political characteristics cannot be used as a proxy for race, Bush, 517 U.S. at 917.\n42\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 43 of 55 PageID #:3271\n Because the Board of Elections asserts that politics was the predominant factor in crafting\nAdopted District 4, it has made no attempt to justify the oddly shaped district under strict scrutiny.20\nDespite the history of District 4, we agree with the Board of Elections that the predominant intent\nin maintaining the district in the Adopted Map was not race, but a desire to keep Democratic\nincumbents in Districts 3, 4, and 5 with their constituents, to preserve existing district boundaries,\nand to maintain communities of interest. \nWe acknowledge that Adopted District 4 continues to have substantially the same shape as\nthe Hastert District 4, which was specifically crafted to remedy a Section 2 Voting Rights Act\nviolation. See Hastert, 777 F. Supp. at 650-51. Indeed, the King I court concluded “that racial\nconsiderations predominated over all other factors in the configuration.” 979 F. Supp. at 606–07.\nThere  are,  however,  certain  notable  changes  in  Adopted  District  4.  For  example,  it  splits\nsignificantly fewer precincts than the Hastert District 4. Adopted District 4 is also slightly more\ncompact and some of the bizarre shaped edges are smoothed out. The inclusion of certain low Latino\nareas west of Central Avenue had the effect of substantially increasing the population in the\nconnector arm, making the district more geographically compact. While the compactness of District\n4 has increased, it is still at the threshold level for low compactness on the Polsby-Popper score and\nstill fails the “eyeball test” for compactness. We note, though, that the compactness of District 4 isn’t\ntoo far afield from some of the other districts in the Adopted Map. For example, District 4's Reock\nscore is within .02 of the mean for the state (.32), suggesting that it reasonably approximates the plan\n20 Compliance with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act would be a compelling interest to\njustify the crafting of a majority-minority district, see King II, 979 F. Supp. at 622, but the Board\nof Elections has argued that there is no polarized voting among Latinos in Cook County. See\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 56 (showing of racial polarization voting is necessary precondition of Section\n2 claim); see also Bush, 517 U.S. at 978 (stating that strict scrutiny requires a “‘strong basis in\nevidence’ for finding that the threshold conditions for § 2 liability are present”). \n43\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 44 of 55 PageID #:3272\nas a whole, at least when considering the Reock measure. See Radogno, No. 1:11-cv-4884, Opinion\nand Order (Dec. 7, 2011), p. 16 & n. 6.   \nThe history and shape of District 4 might ordinarily suggest that race predominated in its\ndesign in 2011. But given the facts presented to us, we find that the history of District 4 actually\npoints in the opposition direction. Preserving the core of prior districts and keeping incumbents with\ntheir constituents are legitimate redistricting objectives. See Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 740\n(1983) and LULAC, 548 U.S. at 440-41. “In some circumstances, incumbency protection might\nexplain as well as, or better than, race a State’s decision to depart from other traditional districting\nprinciples, such as compactness, in the drawing of bizarre district lines.” Bush, 517 U.S. at 967.\nDistrict  4  was  created  in  1991  and  since  that  time,  Congressman  Gutierrez  has  been  the\nrepresentative of that district. As previously discussed, see Part II. B., supra, maintaining District\n4 in substantially the same shape protects the incumbency of Illinois’ lone Latino congressman,\nCongressman Gutierrez, and allows Districts 3 and 5 to remain largely unchanged, permitting\nCongressman Lipinski and Congressman Quigley, respectively, to remain with their constituents.\nFor example, under the Adopted Map, Congressman Gutierrez will retain 82.3 percent of his\nconstituents, Congressman Lipinski will retain 76.4 percent, and Congressman Quigley will retain\n78.9 percent.21\n21Under the Committee’s Map, on the other hand, Congressman Gutierrez would only retain\n41.5 percent of his constituents, Congressman Lipinski would retain 3.5 percent, and Congressman\nQuigley would retain 50.1 percent. The Committee’s Map would also require Congressman Lipinski\nto run against Republican incumbent Congresswomen Biggert in a district that Congressman\nLipinski is projected to lose. The Democrats drew the map to avoid this outcome, and doing so is\na legitimate goal. See Bush, 517 U.S. at 964 (“[I]ncumbency protection, at least in the limited form\nof avoiding contests between incumbent[s], [is] a legitimate state goal.”). \n44\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 45 of 55 PageID #:3273\nThe Committee urges that the Board of Elections cannot rely on preservation of the core as\na redistricting principle where “District 4's core is discriminatory.” As we have already found,\nhowever, District 4 is not discriminatory and its original creation in 1991 was constitutional. District\n4 dictates, in part, the shape of Districts 3 and 5, among other districts. The existence of District 4\nfor the last 20 years has now resulted in constituent-incumbent relationships in all three districts that\ndidn’t exist when the district was first created by the Hastert court and thus, the basis for upholding\nthe oddly shaped district has changed.\nFurther, as we have already noted, keeping the northern and southern Latino enclaves within\nDistrict 4 protects Latino communities of interest. (See supra, p. 31 (citing Hastert, 777 F. Supp. at\n649)). As explained in King I, “[t]o a certain extent, the clustering of Hispanics into two densely\npopulated enclaves provided map makers with the luxury of resorting to traditional districting\nprinciples. It is not surprising to find that a comparatively small district with two densely packed\nminority enclaves is (excluding the connector) more compact and more respectful of political\nsubdivisions than a larger district drawn to capture a more dispersed minority population.” 979 F.\nSupp. at 608. \nNo party suggests that these communities no longer have shared interests and, in fact, the\nLatino plaintiffs testified that Latinos in the area share common core values, and Dr. Engstrom\ntestified that they are politically cohesive. “A State is free to recognize communities that have a\nparticular racial makeup, provided its action is directed toward some common thread of relevant\ninterests.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 920. “[W]hen members of a racial group live together in one\n45\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 46 of 55 PageID #:3274\ncommunity, a reapportionment plan that concentrates members of the group in one district and\nexcludes them from others may reflect wholly legitimate purposes.” Id. (quotations omitted).22\nWe are not suggesting that race had no role in the creation of Adopted District 4. Race\nundoubtedly played a significant role. In fact, during the redistricting process Dr. Lichtman testified\nbefore the Illinois General Assembly and advised lawmakers to maintain District 4 as a majority-\nminority district, even though voting in Cook County was no longer racially polarized. Dr. Lichtman\nexplained that whether voting in Cook County was still racially polarized would need to be\ndetermined by the court through a battle of the experts, and to protect itself from suit, the General\nAssembly should maintain the Latino majority district of District 4 but make it “less uncouth.” \nFurther, the House sponsor of Adopted District 4, State Representative Barbara Currie,\ndefended the district by stating that “an earlier [district] that did not look dissimilar had been upheld\nby the federal courts.” (Pl. Ex. A43, p.15). Representative Currie, however, also stated that race was\nnot the only factor considered. (Id.). She commented, “[w]e certainly looked for opportunities to\nmake sure that members of minority groups have the opportunity for full participation in the\nelectoral process. But we also do look . . . at many other factors . . . . [including] compactness,\ncontiguity, communities of interest, issue of natural boundaries, political boundaries, cities, counties\nand so forth[,] . . . [p]artisan considerations, incumbency, all of those are legitimate values in map\nmaking.” (Id., pp. 15-16, 18). \nThe sponsor of the Adopted Map in the State Senate, Kwame Raoul, explained that the map\nis “intended to comply with the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 with respect to fairness to the\n22Although it is true that the Committee’s Map captures Latino communities of interest in\nits proposed Districts 3 and 4, Adopted District 4 captures the more densely populated Latino areas\nand keeps these Latinos communities with the representative they have had for more than 20 years.\nDoing so fosters a non-racial legitimate redistricting goal.\n46\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 47 of 55 PageID #:3275\nvoting rights of racial and language minorities. In accordance therewith, the legislation retains\neffective African-American and Hispanic majority/minority districts while also achieving population\nequality, the preservation of the core existing district boundaries, and incumbent constituent\nrelationship, and the maintenance of the parties in composition of these districts.” (Pl. Ex. A45, pp.\n9-10). He continued that Adopted District 4 was “preserved to be substantially similar to the 4th\nCongressional District as the 4th Congressional District was presented ten years ago,” and that the\nmap was drawn to maintain this core district. (Id. at pp. 12, 14).\nAccordingly, race was certainly at play in the creation of Adopted District 4, but “[s]tates\nmay intentionally create majority-minority districts, and may otherwise take race into consideration\nwithout coming under strict scrutiny.” Bush, 517 U.S. at 993 (O’Connor, J., concurring). “Only if\ntraditional districting criteria are neglected and that neglect is predominantly due to the misuse of\nrace does strict scrutiny apply.” Id. (emphasis in original). We find, based on all the evidence\npresented, that in drawing Adopted District 4, race was subordinated to politics, preservation of\nexisting  district  boundaries  and  relationships  among  constituents  and  their  Democratic\nrepresentatives, and maintenance of Latino communities of interests. These redistricting objectives\nexplain maintaining the odd shape of District 4 as much, if not more, than race. See Bush, 517 U.S.\nat 999 (“Districts not drawn for impermissible reasons or according to impermissible criteria may\ntake any shape, even a bizarre one.”). \nAs illustrated by the Committee’s proposed District 4, the state could have drawn a more\ncompact majority-minority Latino district. The test, however, is not whether a better map can be\ndrawn, but rather, whether the Committee has shown that there is a legal reason to set the legislator’s\nmap aside. See Miller, 515 U.S. 900 (“Although race-based decisionmaking is inherently suspect,\n47\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 48 of 55 PageID #:3276\nuntil a claimant makes a showing sufficient to support that allegation the good faith of a state\nlegislature must be presumed.”) (internal citation omitted); see also Bush, 517 U.S. at 962 (“The\nConstitution does not mandate regularity of district shape, and neglect of traditional districting\ncriteria is merely necessary, not sufficient,” to require application of strict scrutiny) (internal citation\nomitted). The Committee has not made that showing here. \nAs the Cromartie II Court explained, “where racial identification correlates highly with\npolitical affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that\nthe legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are\ncomparably consistent with traditional redistricting principles.” 532 U.S. at 258. Although the odd\nshape of District 4 cannot be explained by Latinos’ political affiliation with the Democratic party\n(Cook County congressional districts in general are projected as safe Democratic seats, so an oddly\nshaped district in that area is unnecessary to ensure a Democrat win), it can be explained by other\npolitical factors discussed above.23  We therefore find that the principles expounded in Cromartie\nII apply. “[R]eapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State through its\nlegislature,” see Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 156 (quotations omitted), and on the record before us, we\nwill not replace the legislature’s enacted plan with one that inhibits its legitimate objectives while\nadvancing the objectives of the minority political party at the time of redistricting. \n23The Committee’s Map, instead of advancing the Democrats’ legitimate political objectives,\nwould advance Republican objectives. It would displace two Democratic incumbents, require a\nDemocratic incumbent to run against a Republican incumbent in a district he is likely to lose, and\nchange the overall map from Democratic leaning (12 to 6) to evenly bipartisan (8 to 8 with two even\ndistricts). \n48\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 150  Filed: 12/15/11 Page 49 of 55 PageID #:3277\nIII.

See Doc. 105 at 30-37. Why else would Defendants\nrest their new motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander claims—Counts V and VI of\nthe amended complaint (Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 129-44)—on blatant mischaracterizations of (a) Supreme\nCourt precedent, (b) Plaintiffs’ proposed standard for adjudicating such claims, and (c) this\nCourt’s ruling on the prior motion to dismiss? Clearing away all of those mischaracterizations\nleaves nobasis fordismissingPlaintiffs’partisan gerrymanderclaims.\nIndeed, Plaintiffs have fullycured the deficiencies that this Court perceived in dismissing\nCounts V and VIas originallypleaded. See Doc. 98 at 16-22. The amended complaint proposes\na workable and reliable standard for adjudicating partisan gerrymander claims. Doc. 103 at ¶¶\n132-34, 140-42. And it supplies additional facts that plausibly allege how the Adopted Plan\nburdens and penalizes the partisan gerrymander plaintiffs’ exercise of First Amendment\nfreedoms. Id. at ¶ 135. The motion to dismiss thus should be denied, particularly given that\ndiscovery is already over, a bench trial is set to commence in two days, and hearing the partisan\ngerrymander evidence will help the Court evaluate the partisan gerrymander claims and the\nstandardforjudgingthem.\nARGUMENT\nI. ThereAre No Grounds For DismissingCountVI.\nDefendants make two arguments for dismissing Count VI of the amended complaint,\nwhich alleges that the partisan gerrymandering of the Adopted Plan violates the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They contend that the Supreme Court has supposedly\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 3 of 15 PageID #:3039\nrejected the standard that Plaintiffs propose for adjudicating partisan gerrymander claims. And\ntheymaintainthat thestandardis unworkable.\nPlaintiffs’ proposed standard has an intent requirement and an effect requirement. Doc.\n103 at ¶¶ 132, 140. The intent requirement demands direct or circumstantial proof that the\nState’s mapmakers created one or more congressional districts with the predominant intent to\nsecure partisan advantage. Id. at ¶¶ 133, 141. The effect requirement demands a showing of\nthree things: (1) that the Adopted Plan increases the number of districts that favor Democrats by\nat least 10 percentage points according to an accepted measure of partisan voting; (2) that the\nAdopted Plan keeps at least 10 percentage points more constituents of Democratic incumbents in\nthe same district as their representative than it does constituents of Republican incumbents; and\n(3) that at least one of the districts created with the intent to advantage Democrats is among the\ndistricts that contributes to the proof of elements 1 and 2. Id. at ¶¶ 134, 142. Neither of the\narguments that Defendants makeagainst this standardwarrants dismissal of Count VI.\nA. TheSupremeCourtHas NotRejected Plaintiffs’Proposed Standard.\nDefendants badly mischaracterize the relevant Supreme Court precedents in arguing that\nthose precedents foreclose Plaintiffs’ proposed standard. Defendants first say (at 3-4) that Vieth\nv. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004), “expressly rejected” any two-pronged intent/effect standard.\nBut none ofthe opinions in Vieth make anysuch statement. And that is not surprising, giventhat\nthe two-pronged intent/effect standard is the long- and well-established general standard for\nadjudicating all Equal Protection challenges to facially neutral laws. See Vill. of Arlington\nHeights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-65 (1977). Indeed, Justice Kennedy’s\ncontrolling concurrence in Vieth expressly affirms that “there is no doubt” that the general\n“Fourteenth Amendment standard governs.” 541 U.S. at 313-14. In support of their absurd\nclaim to the contrary, Defendants rely only on the Vieth plurality’s rejection of the subsidiary\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:3040\neffect requirement that Justice White proposed in Bandemer v. Davis, 478 U.S. 109, 132-33\n(1986). That part of Vieth neither discards all intent/effect standards nor forecloses the very\ndifferent intent and effect requirements that Plaintiffs propose here. See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 281-\n84.\nDefendants further assert (at 5) that Vieth deemed partisan gerrymandering a “lawful and\ncommon practice” that may not be impeded. For that notion, however, they rely on an out-of-\ncontext passage from the Vieth pluralityopinion. See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 286. Readingthat entire\nopinion reveals that the plurality actually acknowledged that “segregating voters by political\naffiliation” is “unlawful” if it is “excessive.” Id. at 293. In any event—as Defendants\nthemselves persuaded this Court to rule (see Doc. 98 at 17; Doc. 78 at 10 n.5)—Justice\nKennedy’s concurring opinion, not the plurality opinion, is the controlling statement of Vieth’s\nholdings. And Justice Kennedy’s opinion is crystal clear that some partisan gerrymandering\nviolates the Constitution. Vieth, 541 U.S. at 311-12, 316-17 (“we would surelyconclude that the\nConstitution had been violated” if a State declared that apportionments must burden one party’s\nrepresentational rights, so the Court should not foreclose a similar result as to an\n“apportionment’s defacto incorporationofpartisanclassifications”).\nDefendants also maintain (at 4-5) that Vieth rejected the “predominant intent”\nrequirement that Plaintiffs propose. But Defendants again mistakenly invoke the analysis of the\nVieth plurality opinion. See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 284-86.1 Justice Kennedy’s controlling opinion\n1 Plus, that analysis is incorrect. In explaining why they believed the “predominant intent”\nrequirement of racial gerrymander claims could not be borrowed for partisan gerrymander\nclaims, the plurality suggested that applying the requirement to racial gerrymanders would be\neasier because race cannot be used to draw districts while political affiliation can. Vieth, 541\nU.S. at 285-86. But race can sometimes be used to draw districts—such as when the Voting\nRights Act so requires or when race is not the predominant factor and there is no intentional vote\ndilution. See Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 257-58 (2001); King v. State Bd. of Elections,\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:3041\ndoes not criticize the “predominant intent” test. See id. at 306-17. Justice Kennedy faulted the\nstandard offered by the Vieth plaintiffs onlybecause it provided no wayto suitably “measure the\nburden appellants claim has been imposed”—that is, the effect—“on their representational\nrights.” Id. at 313; see also League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 418\n(2006) (“LULAC”) (Kennedy, J.) (Court rejected test proposed in Vieth because it could not\n“show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, in the complainants’ representational\nrights”). Nothing in Vieth or any other Supreme Court decision precludes use of a “predominant\nintent” requirement that mirrors the “predominant intent” requirement for racial gerrymander\nclaims. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995) (describing “predominant intent”\nstandardfor racial gerrymanderclaims).2\nFinally, Defendants contend (at 8) that Vieth criticized the use of “statewide partisanship\nindexes” as part of any partisan gerrymander standard. That contention is just plain wrong.\nFirst, Defendants yet again incorrectly rely on the Vieth plurality opinion, instead of Justice\nKennedy’s controlling opinion. See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 288-90. Second, the Vieth plurality\ncriticizedonlyaparticularproposal—byDefendants’expert inthis case,Allan Lichtman—touse\nthe separate “normalized” results of 18 different statewide races tallied in some unexplained way\nand merged into a general “totality of the circumstances” analysis. See Appellant’s Reply Brief,\nVieth, 541 U.S. 267 (No. 02-1580), 2003 WL 22811823, at *9-*12. That open-ended analysis—\n979 F. Supp. 619, 621-27 (N.D. Ill. 1997), aff’d, 522 U.S. 1087 (1998). And the plurality\nthemselves recognized that some uses of political affiliation in districting are unconstitutional.\nVieth,541U.S.at 293.\n2 Plaintiffs also try (at 4-5) to make something out of the fact that, in LULAC, Justice Kennedy\ncriticized a “sole motivation” requirement for proving a partisan gerrymander. But Plaintiffs do\nnot propose such a requirement. And Justice Kennedy criticized that requirement because it was\ntoo demanding as an intent test (given that other considerations always influence district lines)\nandbecauseit was not coupledwithanyreliabletest oftheburdenontheplaintiffs (i.e., aneffect\nrequirement). LULAC,548U.S.at 417-19(Kennedy,J.).\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:3042\nwhich does not use an index—has nothing in common with the easily applied, district-specific,\nandcompletelyobjective effect requirement that Plaintiffs propose.\nB. Plaintiffs’Proposed Standard Is WorkableAnd Reliable.\nThere is no merit whatsoever to Defendants’ claim that Plaintiffs’ proposed standard for\njudging partisan gerrymander claims is “unworkable” and “unmanageable.” Defendants first\npretend (at 6-8) that they do not understand how the proposed effect requirement works. But the\nelements of that requirement are detailed and calculated in the amended complaint, as well as the\nmotion for permanent injunction filed at the same time. Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 75, 95, 132-34, 140-42\n(amended complaint); Doc. 105 at 35-37 (injunction motion). Defendants cannot reallybe in the\ndark about how the effect requirement works. To avoid any further controversy over the matter,\nhowever, wearehappytoanswerDefendants’supposedquestions.\nThe first element of the effect requirement demands that the Adopted Plan increase the\nnumber of districts that favor Democrats by at least 10 percentage points according to an\naccepted measure of partisan voting. Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 134, 142. That means Plaintiffs must first\nidentify a measure of partisan voting that is accepted by those in the business of measuring\npartisan voting. Plaintiffs have done that by identifying the widely referenced and widely used\nPartisan Voting Index (“PVI”) developed by the Cook Political Report. Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 75, 134,\n142; see also Doc. 105 at 36.3 Plaintiffs must then show that the percentage of all of Illinois’s\n3 As the amended complaint states, “The PVI is a measurement of how strongly a congressional\ndistrict leans toward one political party compared to the nation as a whole. The index for each\ncongressional district is derived by averaging its results from the prior two presidential elections\nand comparing them to national results. The index indicates which party’s candidate was more\nsuccessful in that district, as well as the number of percentage points by which its results\nexceededthenational average. The index is formattedas aletterfollowed byaplus sign andthen\na number. For instance, in a district whose PVI score is D+2, a generic Democratic candidate\nwould be expected to receive 2 percentage points more votes than the national average. An\n“Even” scoreis assigned whenthe district performedwithinhalf a point of thenational average.”\nDoc.103at ¶75n.10.\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:3043\ncongressional districts that favor Democrats in the Adopted Plan, according to the identified\nmeasure of partisan voting, is at least 10 percentage points greater than the percentage of all of\nIllinois’s congressional districts that favor Democrats under the current plan enacted in 2001,\naccording to the exact same measure of partisan voting. Plaintiffs have done that by showing\nthat 12 of Illinois’s 18 congressional districts in the Adopted Plan (66.7%) favor Democrats\naccording to the PVI, while 9 of Illinois’s 19 congressional districts under the current plan\n(47.4%) favor Democrats according to the PVI. Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 75, 134, 142; see also Doc. 105\nat 36-37.4\nThe second element of the effect requirement demands that the Adopted Plan keep at\nleast 10 percentage points more constituents of Democratic incumbents in the same district as\ntheir representative than it does constituents of Republican incumbents. Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 134, 142.\nThat means Plaintiffs must first calculate for each incumbent what percentage of the incumbent’s\nconstituents under the current plan (total population, regardless of party) would be in the district\nin which their representative would reside under the Adopted Plan. Plaintiffs have done that\nanalysis, which reveals overlap figures that range from 100% to 76.4% for the 8 Democratic\nincumbents and range from 67.9% to 1.3% for the 11 Republican incumbents. Doc. 103 at ¶ 95;\nsee also Doc. 105 at 37. Plaintiffs finally must calculate the average of the overlap figures for\nDemocratic incumbents, calculate the average of the overlap figures for the Republican\nincumbents, and then show that the average overlap figure for Democratic incumbents is ten\n4 The example that Defendants offer (at 7) of a situation in which a loss of a congressional seat\nwould supposedly prevent a State from enacting a constitutional redistricting plan is completely\nwrong. If a State had to redistrict after going from 10 to 9 congressional seats and did so by\nredrawing a map with 5 districts favoring Democrats (50%) so that 5 districts continued to favor\nDemocrats (55.6%),the percentageof districts favoringDemocrats would increasebyonly5.6%.\nIn any event, even if a redistricting caused the requisite 10% shift in districts favoring one party,\na constitutional violation would be established only if partisan advantage were the predominant\nmotivationandtheredistrictingsatisfiedtheother elements oftheeffect requirement.\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:3044\npercentage points greater than the average overlap figure for Republican incumbents. Plaintiffs\nhave met that obligation by calculating an average overlap figure of 87.8% for Democratic\nincumbents and a 34.4% average overlap figure for Republican incumbents. Doc. 103 at ¶ 95,\n134,142; seealso Doc.105at 37.\nFinally, the third element of the effect requirement demands that at least one of the\ndistricts created with the intent to advantage Democrats is among the districts that contributes to\nthe proof of elements 1 and 2. Doc. 103 at ¶¶ 134, 142. That requires Plaintiffs to first identify\ndistricts in the Adopted Plan that the mapmakers created with the predominant intent to\nadvantage Democrats. The amended complaint—like the permanent injunction motion—\nidentifies three such districts, Adopted Districts 11, 13, and 17. Doc. 103 at ¶ 131, 133, 139,\n141; see also Doc. 105 at 31-35.5 Plaintiffs next must show that at least one of those districts\ncontributes to the PVI-measured shift of districts toward Democrats under the Adopted Plan\n(element 1) and to the constituent-incumbent overlap disparity among Democratic incumbents\nand Republican incumbents (element 2). Satisfying that obligation, the amended complaint\nexplains that Adopted Districts 11, 13, and 17 all have Democratic-leaning PVI scores and all\nhave constituent-incumbent overlap figures far below any Adopted Districts with Democratic\nincumbents. Doc.103at ¶¶134,142; seealso Doc.105at 37.\n5 In passing, Defendants insinuate (at 3) that the amended complaint improperly adds districts to\nthe ones identified as partisan gerrymanders. But the original complaint did not purport to limit\nthe districts challenged as partisan gerrymanders, but instead challenged the entire map and gave\na few examples based on what was known at the time. See Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 74-75. After receiving\ndiscovery provided at the close of the discovery period (see, e.g., Doc. 106-3 at 96-101\n(injunction motion Ex. A31)), Plaintiffs were able to specify with greater detail the particular\ndistricts that reveal the partisan gerrymander. And Plaintiffs did so once the Court decided the\npreviously pending motion to dismiss. See Doc. 98 (order on dismissal motion); Doc. 103 at\n¶¶131,133-34,139,141-42(amendedcomplaint).\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:3045\nDefendants also object (at 6-8) to the use of the PVI and apparently any other index or\nsimilar measure of partisan voting. Theyare in no position, however, to protest that all measures\nof partisan voting are unworkable because they depend on past voting behavior and do not\nperfectlypredict thefuture. TheState andits helpers at theDemocratic Congressional Campaign\nCommittee (“DCCC”) used just such a measure of partisan voting to create the Adopted Plan.\nSee Doc. 106-3 at 86-89, 102-05 (injunction motion Exs. A28 & A32 describing indices and\nformulas used by State Democrats and DCCC); Doc. 106-4 at 1-6 (injunction motion Exs. A33\n&A34describingsame).\nAs for the supposed flaws that Defendants perceive in the PVI, none reflects any real\nproblem with that widely used measure. That the PVI changes over time is an attribute, not a\nflaw, given that partisan leanings in particular geographies change over time. Likewise, the\nPVI’s supposed failure to pick all of the winners in Illinois’s 2010 congressional elections is\nirrelevant, because that is not what it is designed to do. It is designed—and used in Plaintiffs’\nproposed standard—to measure the relative partisan make-up of differently constituted\ncongressional districts. See Doc. 103 at ¶ 75. And the PVI uses presidential races because they\nare the elections most likely to reflect partisan leanings that can be measured in a consistent way\nin every precinct throughout a State so that the results can be aggregated for districts of any\nconfiguration.\nIn anyevent, these matters are best left for trial because Plaintiffs’ proposed standard can\nuse anyaccepted measure of partisan voting, the merits of anyparticular measure can and should\nbe weighed on the evidence, and nothing Defendants say makes relief on the partisan\ngerrymander claims implausible. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009) (‘When\nthere are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:3046\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.”). Indeed, as Plaintiffs\nhave always maintained (see Doc. 67 at 10-12), the partisan gerrymandering in the Adopted Plan\nis so thorough that any reasonable measure of partisan voting will confirm its existence and\neffect. See Doc. 105 at 28-37. For instance, even though the State and the DCCC have shielded\ntheir partisan voting measures from discovery on privilege grounds, there is every reason to\nbelievethat thosemeasures, too,would prove the requiredunconstitutional effect. See Doc. 106-\n3 at 86-89, 96-101 (injunction motion Exs. A28 & A31 describing predictions about additional\nDemocraticleaningdistricts).\nFinally, again echoing the Vieth plurality (see Vieth, 541 U.S. at 296-97), Defendants\nabsurdly contend (at 9) that Plaintiffs’ proposed standard for judging political gerrymanders\nwould simply multiple the number of “unanswerable questions.” In reality, the proposed effect\nrequirement is purely objective and depends on straight-forward mathematical calculations.\nDoc. 103 at ¶¶134, 142. And the proposed intent requirement matches the intent requirement\nalready applied to racial gerrymander claims. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. Nothing is\nunanswerable about the proposed partisan gerrymander standard. Defendants just don’t like the\nanswers.\nII. ThereAre No Grounds For DismissingCountV.\nDefendants make three arguments for dismissing Count V of the amended complaint,\nwhich alleges that the partisan gerrymandering of the Adopted Plan violates the First\nAmendment. Eachofthearguments is meritless.\nFirst, Defendants surprisingly argue (at 2-3, 9-10) that the Court’s order on their prior\ndismissal motion somehow precludes Plaintiffs from pursuing an amended version of Count V.\nNothing in the Court’s dismissal order supports that argument. To the contrary, the order\nexpressly states, “The plaintiffs may file an amended complaint with respect to their partisan\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:3047\ngerrymandering claims on or before November 7, 2011.” Doc. 98 at 22. That language plainly\nleft the door open for Plaintiffs to amend their complaint with respect to both partisan\ngerrymander “claims.” Indeed, the Court dismissed Count V because Plaintiffs’ original\ncomplaint “add[ed] no facts that would make [the First Amendment] allegations plausible.” Id.\nat 21. Such a problem can be cured. Thus, the Court concluded only that Counts V and VI\n“presently state no claims upon which relief plausibly could be granted.” Id. (emphasis added).\nThe Court’s dismissal order does not preclude plaintiffs from amending their complaint to cure\ntheperceiveddeficiencies inCount V.\nSecond, Defendants maintain (at 10) that Plaintiffs’ improperly propose the same\nstandard for adjudicating partisan gerrymander claims under the First Amendment as they\npropose for adjudicating such claims under the Equal Protection Clause. We have already\nexplained why Defendants’ objections to Plaintiffs’ proposed standard are baseless. See supra\nPart I. And, even though First Amendment analysis can differ from Equal Protection analysis,\nwhen it comes to partisan gerrymander allegations, the focus of both analyses is distinguishing\nunacceptable burdens on voting and representational rights from acceptable ones. See Vieth, 541\nU.S. at 313-15 (Kennedy, J. concurring) (assessing “purpose and effect” of districting by\nmeasuring “burden” on “representational rights” is object of Fourteenth Amendment analysis\nandFirst Amendment analysis). ThestandardproposedbyPlaintiffs accomplishes that task.\nThird, Defendants contend (at 10-12) that partisan gerrymandering does not raise any\nFirst Amendment concerns. Defendants say that the Supreme Court took that position in Vieth.\nBut, once again, Defendants are invoking only the view of the Vieth plurality. See Vieth, 541\nU.S.at 294. JusticeKennedy’s controllingconcurrenceexpresslyrejects that view:\nThe pluralitysuggests there is no place for the First Amendment in this area. The\nimplication is that under the First Amendment any and all consideration of\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:3048\npolitical interests in an apportionment would be invalid. That misrepresents the\nFirst Amendment analysis. The inquiry is not whether political classifications\nwere used. The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to\nburden a group’s representational rights. If a court were to find that a State did\nimpose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views,\nthere would likely be a First Amendment violation, unless the State shows some\ncompellinginterest.\nId. at 314-15 (internal citations omitted); see also id. at 324-26 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (agreeing\nthat partisan gerrymandering violates the First Amendment). Thus, Vieth actually supports\nPlaintiffs’First Amendment claim.\nDefendants also invoke two recent district court decisions that dismissed First\nAmendment partisan gerrymander claims because the plaintiffs in those cases had not plausibly\nalleged how the claimed partisan gerrymander burdened their First Amendment rights. See\nRadogno v. Ill. State Bd. of Elections, No. 1:11-cv-4884, 2011 WL 5025351, at *7-*8 (N.D. Ill.\nOct. 21, 2011); League of Women Voters v. Quinn, No. 1:11-cv-5569, 2011 WL 5143044, at *3-\n*4 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2011). Plaintiffs have amended their complaint to make precisely those\nallegations, explaining how the viewpoint discrimination embodied in the partisan gerrymander\nburdens and penalizes Plaintiffs’ exercise of their representational rights. Doc. 103 at ¶ 135.\nSpecifically, the amended complaint alleges that the Adopted Plan “deters potential Republican\ncongressional candidates from exercising their right to run for office by making a Republican\ncandidacy futile, and it deters potential Republican voters from casting ballots that are likely to\nbe meaningless.” Id. The amended complaint also alleges that “those Democratic members of\nCongress from Illinois whose election is effectively assured by the Proposed Congressional\nPlan’s partisan gerrymandering will necessarily pay little if any heed to their Republican\nconstituents, effectively depriving them of representation based on their political affiliation.” Id.\nTellingly, Defendants never even mention these new allegations detailing the First Amendment\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:3049\nburdens of the Adopted Plan, much less claim that they are so implausible that Count V should\nbedismissed.\nThe relevant First Amendment precedents confirm that Plaintiffs’ allegations are\nadequate to state a First Amendment claim. The Supreme Court has long held that even when\ngovernment action does not actually prohibit protected expression, it can still violate the First\nAmendment ifit deters suchexpressionbyimposingunjustified burdens on that expression. See,\ne.g., Ariz. Free Enter. Club’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 131 S. Ct. 2806, 2817-20 (2011)\n(law that gave a candidate’s opponent matching public funding if the candidate spent private\nfunds in excess of a statutory limit violated the First Amendment, even though it did not restrict\nthe candidate’s expression, because it burdened that expression by “diminishing the\neffectiveness” of that expression and by forcing the candidate to “shoulder a special and\npotentiallysignificant burden”); Watchtower Bible &Tract Soc’y of N.Y.,Inc. v. Vill. of Stratton,\n536 U.S. 150, 165-69 (2002) (ministerial task of obtaining free permit to engage in door-to-door\nadvocacy imposed unconstitutional burden in violation of First Amendment); Anderson v.\nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 786-89, 806 (1983) (striking down state law requiring presidential\ncandidates to file nominating petitions seven months before general election because “the extent\nand nature of the burdens ... placed on the voters’ freedom of choice and freedom of association\n...unquestionablyoutweightheState’s minimal interest inimposing[its]deadline”).\nLikewise, the Supreme Court has been clear that even when viewpoint neutral burdens on\nprotected expression are safe from First Amendment challenge, similar burdens that are\nviewpoint discriminatory violate the First Amendment. See, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector &\nVisitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828-837 (1995) (university violated First Amendment by\nfunding some student groups but not a religious newspaper because “the government must\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:3050\nabstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or\nperspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction”); Anderson, 460 U.S. at 793 (“it is\nespecially difficult for the State to justify a restriction that limits political participation by an\nidentifiable political group whose members share a particular viewpoint, associational\npreference, or economic status” and a court must ask “whether the challenged restriction unfairly\nor unnecessarilyburdens the availabilityof political opportunity”); see also Protect Marriage Ill.\nv. Orr, 463 F.3d 604, 606 (7th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that a state can impose ballot\nrequirements, “provided the requirements are not jiggered in a way that discriminates against\nparticular advocates orviewpoints”).\nHere,theState’s partisan gerrymanderingdeters Republicans from votingandrunningfor\noffice by placing the unjustified and viewpoint-discriminatory burden of vote dilution on those\nprotected forms of expression. Such circumstances state a First Amendment claim under\nArizona Free Enterprise, Anderson, and the other Supreme Court decisions that recognize that\nlaws that diminish the effectiveness of political expression or place special burdens on certain\ndisfavored candidates violate the First Amendment, especially when they discriminate based on\nviewpoint.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny Defendants’\nmotiontodismiss CountsVandVIoftheamendedcomplaint.\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 133 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 15 of 15 PageID #:3051\nDated: November15,2011 Respectfullysubmitted,\n/s/ Lori E.

John Daniel Tinder\nELECTIONS, et al., ) Hon. Robert L. Miller, Jr.\n) Hon. Joan Humphrey Lefkow\nDefendants )\nOPINION AND ORDER\nIllinois lost one Congressional seat pursuant to the 2010 Census. The Illinois Congressional\nRedistricting Act of 2011, which became law on June 24, 2011, adopted a map establishing\nboundaries for the eighteen remaining congressional districts. The plaintiffs in this redistricting\nchallenge contend that the 2011 Map is a product of intentional and illegal vote dilution of Latino\nvoters, particularly in Districts 3, 4, and 5, and an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander against\nRepublican voters statewide, especially in the Chicagoland area and most blatantly in Districts 3 and\n11. The defendants are the Illinois State Board of Elections and its members, to which this opinion\nrefers collectively as “the Board of Elections.” The plaintiffs are an organization called Committee\nfor a Fair and Balanced Map, six registered voters, and ten incumbent Republican members of\nCongress, to which this opinion refers collectively as “the Committee.” The Board of Elections\ndoesn’t dispute the Committee’s standing to bring this redistricting challenge.1 \n1 For a plaintiff to have constitutional standing under Article III, “[f]irst, the plaintiff must have\nsuffered an ‘injury in fact’-an invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized,\nand (b) ‘actual or imminent, not “conjectural” or “hypothetical[.]”  Second, there must be a causal connection\nbetween the injury and the conduct complained of ....Third, it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 2 of 22 PageID #:1023\nA.\nThe court’s jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1357. The Board of\nElections has moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. The court’s October 12, 2011 opinion\nand order set forth the factual background; this opinion assumes the reader’s familiarity with that\nopinion, and adds facts only as needed to discuss the complaint and the motion to dismiss. \nThe first three counts of the Committee’s complaint allege that the 2011 Map violates § 2\nof the Voting Rights Act, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the\nFifteenth Amendment. The complaint alleges that the 2011 Map dilutes the votes of Latino voters\n(including some of the individual plaintiffs) by wedging a “super-majority” unnecessarily into \nDistrict 4 while reducing the number of Latino votes in Districts 3 and 5 – in effect, wasting Latino\nvotes in District 4 and diluting the Latino vote in Districts 3 and 5, where Latinos (the complaint\n‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘readdressed by a favorable decision.’”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (citations omitted). \nA plaintiff who satisfies the constitutional standing requirements for a vote dilution claim under the\nVoting Rights Act also satisfies the constitutional standing requirements for such a claim under the Fourteenth\nand Fifteenth Amendments.  Parker v. Ohio, 263 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1107 (S.D. Ohio 2003), aff’d, 540 U.S.\n1013 (2003); see Perry-Bey v. City of Norfolk, Va., 678 F. Supp. 2d 348, 362 (E.D. Va. 2009) (collecting\ncases).  To demonstrate injury in fact, a vote dilution plaintiff must show that he or she (1) is registered to\nvote and resides in the district where the discriminatory dilution occurred; and (2) is a member of the minority\ngroup whose voting strength was diluted.  See Perry-Bey, 678 F. Supp. 2d at 362–65; Hall v. Virginia, 276\nF. Supp. 2d 528, 531–32 (E.D. Va. 2003);  Ill. Legislative Redistricting Comm’n v. LaPaille, 782 F. Supp.\n1267, 1271 (N.D. Ill. 1991).  The Committee has satisfied these requirements.  See Complt. ¶¶ 11–14.  See\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61. \nThe Committee has also satisfied the injury in fact requirement for a racial gerrymandering claim\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Complt. ¶ 13; United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 744–45 (1995)\n(“Where a plaintiff resides in a racially gerrymandered district, however, the plaintiff has been denied equal\ntreatment because of the legislature’s reliance on racial criteria, and therefore has standing to challenged the\nlegislature’s action.”) (citation omitted). According to the Committee, its injuries were caused by a\ndiscriminatory redistricting process, the product of which will be implemented by the Board of Elections, and\nits requested relief is likely to redress the harm.  As such, the Committee has standing to bring Counts I–IV. \nCounts V and VI are discussed infra. \n \n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 3 of 22 PageID #:1024\nalleges) would have no significant influence in choosing primary and general election candidates\nof their choice. \n1.\nFor purposes of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, vote dilution is the practice of reducing the\npotential effectiveness of a group’s voting strength by limiting the group’s chances to translate that\nstrength into voting power. See, e.g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (Shaw I). Racially\npolarized voting creates the risk that state legislatures may dilute the voting strength of politically\ncohesive minority groups by manipulating district lines. See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146,\n153-154 (1993). Vote dilution most often is attempted either by scattering the minority voters among\nseveral districts in which a bloc-voting majority can outvote them regularly, or by centralizing them\ninto one or two districts and leaving the other districts relatively free from their influence. See\nJohnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1007 (1994). Intentional vote dilution through the drawing\nof district lines violates both § 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment, see\nRogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 617 (1982), and § 2 of the Voting Rights Act also forbids facially\nneutral districting that has the effect of diluting minority votes.  42 U.S.C. § 1973. \nSection 2 provides that “[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,\npractice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State . . . in a manner which results in a\ndenial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor . . . as provided in subsection (b) of this section.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a). Subsection (b) provides\nthat a violation of subsection (a) “is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown\nthat the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State . . . are not equally open\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 4 of 22 PageID #:1025\nto participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that\nits members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political\nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b). The 1982 amendments\nto  section 1973 eliminated the requirement of intentional discrimination by substituting a “results”\ntest for the “purpose” test previously imposed by the Supreme Court. See Ketchum v. Byrne, 740\nF.2d 1398, 1403 (7th Cir. 1984). \nGenerally, a group of plaintiffs must prove three preconditions to prove a § 2 claim: (1) that\ntheir minority group is large enough and geographically compact enough to be a majority in a single-\nmember district, or in more single-member districts than the redistricting plan created; (2) that their\nminority group is “politically cohesive,” meaning that its members vote in a similar fashion; and (3)\nthe majority votes as bloc, allowing majority voters usually to defeat the minority’s preferred\ncandidates. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 48-51 (1986). If the plaintiffs satisfy the burden of\nproving those conditions, the court moves on to decide, based on the totality of the circumstances,\nwhether a § 2 violation has occurred, see De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1011, considering (among other\nthings) the state’s history of voting-related discrimination, the degree of racial polarization in voting,\nand whether and how the state has used voting practices or procedures that facilitate discrimination\nagainst the plaintiffs’ minority group. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44-45.\nThe Board of Elections says the Committee’s § 2 claim should be dismissed because it\ndoesn’t allege the first Gingles precondition, which “requires the possibility of creating more than\nthe existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to\nelect candidates of its choice.” League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 430\n(2006) (LULAC) (quoting De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1008). The Board of Elections also argues that\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 5 of 22 PageID #:1026\nthe Committee’s complaint only parrots the language of Gingles with respect to the second and third\nprecondition. Section 2 claims are district-specific, the Board of Elections says, so the Committee’s\ncomplaint must (but doesn’t) allege that the majority votes enough as a bloc to allow it usually to\ndefeat the Latino voters’ preferred candidate in each of the Districts 3 and 5. Gingles, 478 F.3d at\n51. The Board of Elections also contends that the Committee hasn’t alleged any facts relevant to the\ntotality of the circumstances analysis, such as a history of discrimination against Latinos affecting\nvoter turnout or a history of electoral discrimination, a lack of proportionality in the citizen voting-\nage population, or polarized voting specific to Cook County.\nThe Committee asserts that because it can show intentional discrimination, it doesn’t need\nto follow the Gingles test.2 The Supreme Court has not resolved this issue, but has at least implied\nthat the first Gingles precondition may be relaxed where intentional discrimination is shown. In\nBartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 129 S.Ct. 1231, 1246 (2009), the Court held that a “party asserting\n§ 2 liability must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the minority population in the\npotential election district is greater than 50 percent.” The Court limited its holding by noting that\nthe case did not involve allegations of intentional and wrongful conduct, and therefore, the Court\ndidn’t need to resolve whether “intentional discrimination affects the Gingles analysis.” Id. The\nCourt expressly stated that its holding in that case “does not apply to cases in which there is\nintentional discrimination against a racial minority.” Id. (Kennedy, J., plurality); see also Baird v.\n2Under the Committee’s theory, we question whether the standard for addressing their § 2 VRA claim\nwould be any different than the standard applicable to the Fourteenth Amendment vote dilution claim in\nCount II. In Barnett v. Daley, 32 F.3d 1196, 1202 (7th Cir. 1994), the court stated that what role, if any, intent\nplays under § 2 of the VRA needn’t be decided because “[i]f the plaintiffs can prove intent, they don’t need\nthe Voting Rights Act; they will have a complete remedy under the equal protection clause.” We nevertheless\naddress this issue because the Committee can allege overlapping theories of liability. \n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 6 of 22 PageID #:1027\nConsolidated City of Indianapolis, 976 F.2d 357, 359 (7th Cir. 1992) (implying that intentional\ndiscrimination under § 2(a) doesn’t require the same analysis as an effects-based claim under §\n2(b)); see also Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 158 (stating that Gingles “cannot be applied mechanically and\nwithout regard to the nature of the claim”).  \nThe circuit courts that have addressed this issue have taken varying approaches. The Ninth\nCircuit in Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 769 (9th Cir. 1990) held that “to the extent\nthat Gingles does require a majority showing, it does so only in a case where there has been no proof\nof intentional dilution of minority voting strength.”Id.; see also United States v. Brown, 561 F.3d\n420, 432 (5th Cir. 2009) (indicating that discriminatory intent alone will ordinarily be sufficient to\nprove a § 2 violation). But “[e]ven where there has been a showing of intentional discrimination,\nplaintiffs must show that they have been injured as a result.” Garza, 918 F.2d at 771. The court\nexplained that “[a]lthough the showing of injury in cases involving discriminatory intent need not\nbe as rigorous as in effects cases, some showing of injury must be made to assure that the district\ncourt can impose a meaningful remedy.” Id. Plaintiffs must still show that their members had less\nopportunity than other residents in the district to participate in the political processes and to elect\nlegislators of their choice. Id.; see also African Am. Voting Rights Legal Defense Fund, Inc. v. Villa,\n54 F.3d 1345, 1357 n.18 (8th Cir. 1995) (approving this approach).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit in Johnson v. DeSoto County Bd. of Commissioners, 72 F.3d 1556,\n1561-63 (11th Cir. 1996), citing to Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 154-57 and the plain language of § 2, \nheld that intent alone was insufficient to establish a violation. Although intentional discrimination\nwasn’t shown in Voinovich, it was alleged, yet, the Court stated that “§ 2 focuses exclusively on the\nconsequences of apportionment. Only if the apportionment scheme has the effect of denying a\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 7 of 22 PageID #:1028\nprotected class the equal opportunity to elect its candidate of choice does it violate § 2; where such\nan effect has not been demonstrated, § 2 simply does not speak to the matter.” 507 U.S. at 155. The\nCourt held that  plaintiffs can prevail on a claim under § 2 “only if they show that, under the totality\nof circumstances, the State’s apportionment scheme has the effect of diminishing or abridging the\nvoting strength of the protected class.” Id. at 157 (emphasis added); see also Barnett v. Daley, 32\nF.3d 1196, 1202 (7th Cir. 1994) (citing to Voinovich and stating that it is “no longer clear that intent\nplays any role in a suit under section 2”) (emphasis in original).\nThe Johnson court also looked to the plain language of § 2(a) which states that “[n]o voting\nqualification or prerequisite to voting or standing, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied\n. . . in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right . . . to vote on account of race\nor color . . . .”  Johnson, 72 F.3d at 1563 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a)). The court explained that\nthe “statutory language expressly requires a showing of discriminatory results, and it admits of no\nexception for situations in which there is discriminatory intent but no discriminatory results.” Id..\nThat doesn’t mean, the Johnson court reasoned, that intent has no role to play in a § 2\nviolation.  Although  the  court  disagreed  that  “intent  to  discriminate  lessens  the  amount  of\ndiscriminatory results that must be shown[,]” it held that “[i]t is circumstantial evidence of\ndiscriminatory results that should be considered in assessing the ‘totality of the circumstances.’” Id.\nat 1565. The court explained that “[w]here it can be inferred, as it often can be, that the enactors\nwere in a good position to know the effect their actions would have, the fact that the enactment was\nmotivated by a desire to produce discriminatory results will often be strong, albeit circumstantial,\nevidence that such results were achieved.” Id.\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 8 of 22 PageID #:1029\nWhile the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits disagree as to the extent of discriminatory results that\nmust be shown when there is discriminatory intent, both agree that even if there is such intent, there\nstill must be some showing of discriminatory effect. Considering these concepts in tandem is a solid\nform of analysis under the VRA. A showing that the drafters of the plan intended to discriminate\nvery well may lead to the conclusion that the plan had its intended effect, but the other factors in the\ntotality of circumstances test are still relevant in resolving the issue. Therefore, the first Gingles\nfactor is appropriately relaxed when intentional discrimination is shown, but the Committee will\nnevertheless have to show that the plan lessened the Latinos’ opportunity to elect a candidate of its\nchoice. We believe for the Committee to show discriminatory effects they will have to prove that\nthe second and third Gingles preconditions are established – that the minority group is politically\ncohesive and that the majority votes as a bloc, allowing the majority voters usually to defeat the\nminority’s preferred candidates. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51.  It must make this showing on a district\nspecific basis. Id.  \nIf the Committee merely proves what is alleged in their complaint, it will face an uphill\nbattle. For starters, it hasn’t alleged that the third Gingles precondition is established on a district-\nwide basis, nor have they identified how the Latinos’ opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice\nin Districts 3 and 5 has been affected by the reduction of Latino voting-age population in those\ndistricts as a result of an increase in District 4. As the Seventh Circuit has said, “because of both age\nand the percentage of noncitizens, Latinos must be 65 to 70 percent of the total population in order\nto be confident of electing a Latino.” Barnett v. City of Chicago, 141 F.3d 699, 703 (7th Cir. 1998)\n(citing Ketchum, 740 F.2d at 1415). “[T]he plaintiff must show that there is a feasible alternative to\nthe defendant’s map, an alternative that does a better job of balancing the relevant factors, although\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 9 of 22 PageID #:1030\nthe fine-tuning of the alternative can be left to the remedial stage of the litigation.”  Barnett, 141\nF.3d at 702 (emphasis in original).\nFurther, we agree with the Board of Elections that the more appropriate inquiry in this case\nfor the proportionality factor, which is analyzed on a statewide basis, is citizen voting-age\npopulation. The Seventh Circuit stated in Barnett “that the proper benchmark for measuring\nproportionality is citizen voting-age population.” 141 F.3d at 705. The court reasoned that “citizen\nvoting-age population is the basis for determining equality of voting power that best comports with\nthe policy of [§ 2].” Id. at 704. The court further explained that “[n]either the census nor any other\npolicy or practice suggests that Congress wants noncitizens to participate in the electoral system as\nfully as the concept of virtual representation would allow.” Id.  “The right to vote is one of the\nbadges of citizenship. The dignity and very concept of citizenship are diluted if noncitizens are\nallowed to vote either directly or by the conferral of additional voting power on citizens believed\nto have a community of interest with the noncitizens.” Id.\nThis position seems to have support from the Supreme Court’s decision in LULAC, 548 U.S.\nat 429. When determining whether District 23 created a Latino opportunity district for purposes of\nthe first Gingles condition, the Court stated that the relevant inquiry was citizen voting-age\npopulation, not merely voting-age population. Id. The Court reasoned that “[t]his approach fits the\nlanguage of § 2 because only eligible voters affect a group’s opportunity to elect candidates.” Id.\nSimilarly, when discussing proportionality under the totality of circumstances, the Court looked to\nthe citizen voting-age population. Id. at 436. \nWe recognize that it may be difficult for the Committee to make this showing because the\n2010 census doesn’t include citizenship, but citizen voting-age population can be shown through\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 10 of 22 PageID #:1031\nexpert testimony; census data is not required. We also recognize that proportionality is just one\nfactor to consider in the totality of circumstances. This test allows us to consider both census voting-\nage population data and evidence deducing citizen voting-age population. \nDespite these infirmities in the Committee’s complaint, we don’t believe that it must be\ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(6). The Board of Elections demands more of the Committee’s complaint\nthan the law requires. A complaint must contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing\nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.” FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations aren’t\nrequired, but the complaint must contain enough factual matter “to ‘state a claim that is plausible\non its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic\nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); see also Morrison v. YTB Int’l, Inc., 649 F.3d 533,\n538 (7th Cir. 2011); Brooks v. Ross, 578 F.3d 574, 581 (7th Cir. 2009). To plead a plausible claim,\na complaint must contain “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that\nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949; see also Swanson v.\nCitibank, N.A., 614 F.3d 400, 404 (7th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he plaintiff must give enough details about\nthe subject-matter of the case to present a story that holds together.”). “Threadbare recital of the\nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal, 129\nS. Ct. at 1949. \nBut a complaint needn’t specifically plead every element the pleader must prove at trial. See\nReynolds v. CB Sports Bar, Inc., 623 F.3d 1143, 1147 (7th Cir. 2010) (“[A]lthough the plaintiff is\nrequired to plead more than bare legal conclusions to survive a motion to dismiss, once the plaintiff\npleads sufficient factual material to state a plausible claim – that is, sufficient to put the defendant\non notice of a plausible claim against it – nothing in Iqbal or Twombly precludes the plaintiff from\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 11 of 22 PageID #:1032\nlater suggesting to the court a set of facts, consistent with the well-pleaded complaint, that shows\nthat the complaint should not be dismissed.”); see also Bausch v. Stryker Corp., 630 F.3d 546, 560\n(7th Cir. 2010) (holding that since plaintiffs usually lack enough pre-filing information to identity\nthe precise defect with a product, the precise defect needn’t be pleaded in the complaint), cert.\ndenied,     S. Ct.    , 2011 WL 3047772 (U.S. Oct. 31, 2011). A plaintiff, then, must put enough\nspecifics in the complaint to keep the complaint from being “implausible.” The complaint must\ncontain enough in the way of factual allegations to make it more than a “sheer possibility” that the\ndefendant has acted unlawfully. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949; accord, In re Text Messaging Antitrust\nLitigation, 630 F.3d 622, 629 (7th Cir. 2010), cert denied, 131 S. Ct. 2165 (Apr. 25, 2011) (“[T]hat\nthe allegations undergirding a claim could be true is no longer enough to save a complaint from\nbeing dismissed; the complaint must establish a nonnegligible probability that the claim is valid; but\nthe probability need not be as great as such terms as ‘preponderance of the evidence’ connote.”). \nGiven the specific allegations in the Committee’s complaint, we see nothing implausible\nabout the possibility that the Committee could prove each allegation in the complaint and, consistent\nwith the complaint’s allegations, further prove that enough Latino voters could be reassigned within\nthe three districts to create two reasonably compact districts that provide Latinos with an opportunity\nto elect a candidate of their choice, that there’s about as many Latino citizen voters as voting age\nLatinos, that Latinos are politically cohesive in the challenged area, and that the majority votes as\na bloc in the challenged districts to defeat the Latino voter’s preferred candidate.  \nMore facts might be alleged, but the Committee’s complaint states a § 2 claim that rises\nabove implausibility and gives the Board of Elections ample notice of the nature of the claim. We\ndeny the Board of Election’s dismissal motion insofar as it is directed toward Count I of the\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 12 of 22 PageID #:1033\nCommittee’s complaint. \n2.\nCount II of the Committee’s complaint purports to state a claim for vote dilution under the\nFourteenth Amendment, which requires a showing that the redistricting was “conceived or operated\nas [a] purposeful devic[e] to further racial discrimination..” City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55,\n66 (1980) (Stewart, J., plurality opinion) (quoting Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149 (1971)),\n“by minimizing, cancelling out or diluting the voting strength of racial elements of the voting\npopulation.” Rogers, 458 U.S. at 617 (quoting Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 149). Courts use a totality of\nthe circumstances analysis in deciding whether a challenged redistricting plan violates either the\nFourteenth Amendment or § 2 of the Voting Rights Act. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36-37; Rogers, 458\nU.S. at 620-622 and n.8. \nThe Board of Elections says Count II is insufficient for the same reasons Count I is\ninsufficient. We disagreed with the Board of Elections as to Count I, for reasons we have already\ndiscussed. Because the Board of Elections advances no new reasons to dismiss Count II, we deny\nthe Board of Elections’ motion to the extent it is directed to the Fourteenth Amendment vote dilution\nclaim in Count II.\n3.\nCount III of the Committee’s complaint seeks to state a vote dilution claim under the\nFifteenth Amendment, section 1 of which provides, “The right of citizens of the United States to\nvote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color,\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 13 of 22 PageID #:1034\nor previous condition of servitude.” In its motion to dismiss, the Board of Elections contends that\nthe Fifteenth Amendment “prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial or abridgment by\ngovernment of the freedom to vote,” Bolden, 446 U.S. at 65 (plurality opinion), and doesn’t apply\nto vote dilution. (See Doc. No. 40, pp. 8-9) (citing Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 513-514 (2000);\nReno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 528 U.S. 320, 334 n.3 (2000); Bolden, 446 U.S. at 65; Beer v.\nUnited States, 425 U.S. 130, 142 n.14 (1976); Osburn v. Cox, 369 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir. 2004)).\nThe law isn’t as straightforward as the Board of Elections sees it. The language of § 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act, which forbids intentional vote dilution, “track[s], in part, the text of the Fifteenth\nAmendment.” Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1240; see, e.g., Northcross v. Bd. of Educ. of Memphis City\nSchs., 412 U.S. 427, 428 (1973) (stating that the similarity in language of two statutes is “a strong\nindication that the two statutes should be interpreted par passu.”).  The Supreme Court hasn’t\ndecided whether the Fifteenth Amendment applies to vote dilution claims. Voinovich, 507 U.S. at\n159. The language the Board of Elections cites in Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 528 U.S. at 334 n.3,\ndoesn’t resolve the issue; it simply keeps the issue undecided. As one court of appeals said, “We\nsimply cannot conclude that the [Supreme] Court’s silence and reservation on these issues clearly\nforecloses Plaintiffs’ Fifteenth Amendment claim.” Page v. Bartels, 248 F.3d 175, 193, n.12 (3d Cir.\n2001). Intentionally discriminatory redistricting can violate the Fifteenth Amendment “if done with\nthe purpose of depriving a racial minority group of the right to vote.” Id. at 193; see also Hastert v.\nState Bd. of Elections, 777 F.Supp. 634, 645 (N.D. Ill. 1991). The record doesn’t tell us why the\nCommittee wants to proceed to trial on what it contends are two identical counts, but that’s not what\nwe have to decide today.\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 14 of 22 PageID #:1035\nThe Committee’s complaint, the Board of Elections argues, doesn’t assert a plausible claim\nthat the 2011 Map denies the Latino plaintiffs the right to vote. We disagree with the premise of this\nargument: Fifteenth Amendment plaintiffs needn’t allege a complete denial of their right to vote.\nThe Fifteenth Amendment also prohibits a purposefully discriminatory abridgment of the freedom\nto vote. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. at 65 (plurality opinion). The Committee’s complaint alleges\nthat the 2011 Map intentionally discriminates against Latino voters and effectively “denies or\nabridges the right of the Racial Dilution Plaintiffs to vote” by packing District 4 with more Latino\nvoters than necessary to elect their candidate of choice and by reducing the number of Latino voters\nin Districts 3 and 5. It alleges that Latino voters traditionally and consistently vote cohesively in\nCook County; that “[m]any Latino voters in proposed District 4 will see their votes wasted because\nthe Plan intentionally makes those votes unnecessary to elect a candidate of their choice,” and that\nthe intentionally diminished numbers in Districts 3 and 5 will keep Latino voters in those districts\nfrom having any significant influence in choosing primary and general election candidates. Those\nallegations amount to a plausible claim under the Fifteenth Amendment of intentional abridgment\nof some of the plaintiffs’ right to vote through vote dilution.\nWe deny the Board of Elections’ motion to dismiss to the extent it seeks dismissal of Count\nIII of the Committee’s complaint. \n4.\nCount IV of the Committee’s complaint alleges racial gerrymandering in violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A plaintiff\nproves  an  Equal  Protection  Clause  violation  in  redistricting  by  showing  that  race  was  the\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 15 of 22 PageID #:1036\nlegislature’s predominant motive in drawing district lines. Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905 (1996)\n(Shaw II); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). The Board of Elections says Count IV isn’t\npleaded sufficiently because the Committee’s complaint doesn’t make enough factual allegations\nto support its claim that racial considerations trumped traditional districting principles; the complaint\neven alleges that the redistricting after the 1990 Census created a district shaped and located\nsimilarly to the 2011 Map’s District 4. Again, the Board of Elections asks more of the complaint\nthan the law requires. \nOne way a plaintiff can state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause is by alleging that\na state redistricting plan, on its face, has no rational explanation except as an effort to separate voters\non the basis of race. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 649 (1993) (Shaw I). The Committee’s complaint\nmakes those allegations with respect to District 4 in ¶¶ 3, 59-68, and 125. The Committee’s\ncomplaint also alleges in ¶¶ 59-62 that previous litigation “established that race — that is, Latino\nethnicity — was the predominant consideration in the creation of” a predecessor district that had a\nvery similar shape and was in the same location as the newly adopted District 4. Those allegations\nare sufficient to state, and put the Board of Elections on notice of, a claim upon which relief\nplausibly can be granted. \nThe Board of Elections’ motion to dismiss is denied to the extent it is directed toward the\nFourteenth Amendment racial gerrymandering claim in Count IV.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 16 of 22 PageID #:1037\n5.\nThe Board of Elections also argues that the Committee has pleaded itself out of court on the\nfirst four counts, each of which asserts that intentional discrimination against Latino voters was the\nprimary motive behind the 2011 Map, by including the last two counts, which allege that intentional\ndiscrimination against Republican voters was the primary motive behind the 2011 Map. We\ndisagree. Rule 8(d)(3) specifically provides that “[a] party may state as many separate claims or\ndefenses as it has, regardless of consistency.” FED. R. CIV. P. 8(d)(3); see also Brown v. United\nStates, 976 F.2d 1104, 1108 (7th Cir. 1992). \n6.\nCounts V and VI allege discrimination, not against Latino voters, but rather against\nRepublican voters statewide, and as noted, especially in the Chicagoland area and most blatantly in\nDistricts 3 and 11. In those counts, the Committee’s complaint alleges that the 2011 Map\n“intentionally and unreasonably dilutes the votes of Republican voters in a manner that gives\nRepublicans a far smaller chance of electing candidates of their choice than would result from\ntraditional, non-partisan redistricting” in violation of the First Amendment (Count V) and Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count VI). The Board of Elections argues that\npartisan gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable political questions, and that the Committee hasn’t\nidentified a manageable standard for adjudicating its claims. The Committee responds that partisan\ngerrymandering claims are justiciable, and that the Board of Elections (as the party seeking\ndismissal) should have to identify the standard under which it contends these counts are insufficient.\n16\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 17 of 22 PageID #:1038\nThe Committee also says its complaint states viable Constitutional claims because it sets forth\nextensive factual detail about how the 2011 Map discriminates against Republican voters. \nThe Committee is correct that the Supreme Court, a quarter century ago, rejected the\nargument that partisan gerrymandering claims are not justiciable,  Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109,\n118-127 (1986), that the Court had ample opportunity to revisit and reject that position in Vieth v.\nJubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004), and that while four justices rejected the justiciability of such claims,\nno majority embraced the opportunity, see LULAC, 548 U.S. at 414. The Board of Elections argues\nthat no plaintiff has prevailed in a partisan gerrymandering case during that quarter century, but what\nother plaintiffs might have (or might not have) accomplished tells us nothing about the sufficiency\nof the Committee’s complaint. \nWe look to Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Vieth for resolution of this issue. “When a\nfragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of\nfive justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\nconcurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds.” Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193\n(1977) (internal quotations marks omitted). Although Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion left\nopen the possibility that such claims may be justiciable, see Vieth, 541 U.S. at 306 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring) (“I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise\nrationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting\ncases.”), he agreed that the Court’s previously announced standards in Bandemer (including Justice\nPowell’s “fairness standard” set forth in his concurrence), the standard proposed by the plaintiffs\nin that case, and those standards set forth by the dissenters, were all unworkable. Id. at 308\n(acknowledging that the plurality “demonstrate[d] the shortcomings of the other standards that have\n17\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 18 of 22 PageID #:1039\nbeen considered to date”). Justice Kennedy concluded that a complaint will fail to state a claim if\nthe plaintiffs cannot articulate a justiciable standard. Id. at 313 (“[A]ppellants’ complaint alleges no\nimpermissible use of political classifications and so states no valid claim on which relief may be\ngranted. It must be dismissed as a result.”). That is the narrowest ground for the Court’s ruling and\nthe one we are bound to follow.\nGenerally, as the Committee says in response, a complaint needn’t plead a legal theory. See,\ne.g., Hatmaker v. Memorial Medical Center, 619 F.3d 741, 743 (7th Cir. 2010) (Twombly and Iqbal\n“do not undermine the principle that plaintiffs in federal courts are not required to plead legal\ntheories.”), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1603 (2011); Aaron v. Mahl, 550 F.3d 659, 666 (7th Cir. 2008);\nO'Grady v. Village of Libertyville, 304 F.3d 719, 723 (7th Cir. 2002). But a different approach\nprevails in the field of partisan gerrymandering because courts haven’t been able to agree on the\nconstituent elements of a claim. In its two most recent decisions addressing partisan gerrymandering\nclaims, the Supreme Court lent strong support to the Board of Elections’ argument that without an\nexisting workable standard by which to measure such claims, partisan gerrymandering claims are\nsubject to dismissal. See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 418 (Kennedy, J., for 3 justices) (“[A] successful claim\nattempting to identify unconstitutional acts of partisan gerrymandering must...show a burden, as\nmeasured by a reliable standard, on the complainants’ representational rights”); Vieth, 541 U.S. at\n313 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (absent “a standard by which to measure the burden [plaintiff] claim\nhas been imposed on their representational rights, [they] cannot establish that the alleged political\nclassifications burden those same rights”).\nThe Committee notes that Vieth was decided before the Supreme Court modified the\npleading standard in Iqbal and Twombly. But that argument gets the Committee nowhere because\n18\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 19 of 22 PageID #:1040\nif anything, Iqbal and Twombly heightened the pleading standard, see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563\n(retooling federal pleading standards; and retiring the oft-quoted formulation that “a complaint\nshould not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff\ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief”), so those\ndecisions only reinforce Justice Kennedy’s view that the plaintiffs must set forth a standard by which\nto judge the plausibility of the plaintiffs’ factual assertions. \nThe Committee’s Fourteenth Amendment partisan gerrymandering claim must be dismissed\nbecause, with no workable standard yet in existence, the court can’t say that its allegations give rise\nto a plausible claim upon which relief can be granted. See Perez v. Texas, No. 11-CA-360-OLG-\nJES-XR, slip op. at 19-22 (W.D. Tex. Sep. 2, 2011) (Exh. A to the Board of Election’s reply [Doc.\nNo. 78-1]) (finding that such claims are justiciable, but “are viable only if there is a reliable legal\nstandard that can be applied in determining the issues,” and that the political gerrymandering claims\nshould be dismissed because the plaintiffs “failed to enunciate a reliable standard”); see also\nRadogno v. Illinois State Bd. of Elections, No. 1:11-cv-4884, 2011 WL 5025251, *6 (N.D. Ill. Oct.\n21, 2011) (dismissing political gerrymandering claim with leave to refile upon finding that such\nclaims are justiciable, but that plaintiffs failed to articulate a workable standard by which to assess\nthat claim). \nWe surmise that amendment might be futile in light of today’s understanding of the law\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.  A majority of the Court in Vieth rejected all proposed standards\n(the standards in Bandemer, the standard proposed by the plaintiffs in that case, and those standards\nset forth by the dissenters). See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 284-94; see also id. at 308 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring). We too must reject the same standards denounced in Vieth. The plurality stated that “the\n19\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 20 of 22 PageID #:1041\nfact that partisan districting is a lawful and common practice means that there is almost always room\nfor  an  election-impeding  lawsuit  contending  that  partisan  advantage  was  the  predominant\nmotivation.” Id. at 286 (emphasis in original). The plurality further noted that “a person’s politics\nis rarely readily discernible – and never as permanently discernible – as a persons’ race. Political\naffiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and even\nwithin a given election, not all voters follow the party line.” Id. at 287 (emphasis in original). Such\nfacts, the plurality found, “make it impossible to assess the effects of partisan gerrymandering, to\nfashion a standard for evaluating a violation and finally to craft a remedy.” Id.; see also LULAC, 548\nU.S. at 417, 423, 483 (no majority opinion for any single criterion of impermissible political\ngerrymander and thus, no reliable standard to judge claim even though evidence showed that\nredistricting was done with sole purpose of political gain). \nEven under the now rejected Bandemer standard, the Vieth Court noted that in only one case\nhad a court granted relief on a partisan gerrymandering claim and that was preliminary relief in a\ncase that didn’t involve the drawing of district lines. See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 279. In all other cases\naddressing such claims, relief has been denied. See id. at 279-80 and n.6 (citing cases).\nNevertheless, heeding Justice Kennedy’s pronouncement in Vieth, “[t]hat no such standard\nhas emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future,” id. at 311,\nwe will give the Committee until November 7, 2011 to amend its complaint in an effort to articulate\na workable and reliable standard for adjudicating their partisan gerrymandering claim and sufficient\nfactual allegations to demonstrate plausibility.  \nThe political gerrymandering claim under the First Amendment found in Count V of the\nCommittee’s complaint falls to a different obstacle. The complaint alleges in ¶¶ 131-133 that the\n20\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 21 of 22 PageID #:1042\n2011 Map “intentionally and unreasonably dilutes the votes of Republicans voters [statewide and\nin Districts 3 and 11] in a manner that gives Republican voters a far smaller chance of electing\ncandidates of their choice than would result from traditional, non-partisan redistricting,” and\n“burdens and penalizes the Partisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs’ exercise of their freedom of association,\ntheir right to express political views, and their right to petition the government for redress of\ngrievances,” in violation of the First Amendment. The Committee’s complaint adds no facts that\nwould make those allegations plausible. The Committee’s complaint doesn’t make plausible a\nfinding that the 2011 Map infringes Republican voters’ rights to associate with each other or with\nanyone else, or a finding that the 2011 Map burdens Republican voters’ rights of free expression,\nor that the 2011 Map affects Republican voters’ rights to petition the government. The Committee’s\ncomplaint contains a considerable number of allegations to the effect that the 2011 Map will make\nit more difficult for Republican voters to elect Republican candidates, but that doesn’t implicate a\nFirst Amendment right. See Washington v. Finlay, 664 F.2d 913, 927-28 (4th Cir. 1981) (“The first\namendment’s protection of the freedom of association and of the rights to run for office, have one’s\nname on the ballot, and present one’s views to the electorate do not also include entitlement to\nsuccess in those endeavors.”); see also Radogno v. Illinois State Bd. of Elections, 2011 WL\n5025251, *8 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 21, 2011)(dismissing First Amendment political gerrymandering claim,\nreasoning that the “effects of political gerrymandering on the ability of a political party and its voters\nto elect a member of the party to a seat . . . implicates no recognized First Amendment right”)\n(quoting Kidd v. Cox, No. 1:06-CV-997-BBM, 2006 WL 1341302, at *19 (N.D. Ga. May 16, 2006)).\nCounts V and VI of the Committee’s complaint presently state no claims upon which relief\nplausibly could be granted. The Board of Elections’ motion to dismiss is granted with respect to\n21\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 98  Filed: 11/01/11 Page 22 of 22 PageID #:1043\nthose counts. \nB.\nFor all of these reasons, the court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss (Doc. No.39). The motion is granted with respect to Counts V and\nVI, and denied with respect to Counts I, II, III, and IV.

In so\ndoing, Defendants misquotethis Court and paternalisticallyargue in effect that Plaintiffs’ casein\nchief would be better served without the addition of any fact witnesses—ignoring of course their\nown stated intent to call two fact witnesses. Defendants’ Motion in Limine highlights one of the\nkey differences between the parties in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek to vindicate the rights of\nindividual voters and to let them speakforthemselves whileDefendants haveengaged in alitany\nof tactics aimed at emphasizing that the rights of individual citizens and voters do not matter to\ntheState. This caseis about thevoters of Illinois, and thoseveryvoters who stepped up to actas\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 2 of 17 PageID #:3098\nplaintiffs in this litigation should be allowed to tell their story.1 Defendants’ Motion in Limine is\nwhollywithoutmeritand shouldbedenied.\nARGUMENT\nIt is well-settled that a motion in limine should be granted only if the evidence clearly is\nnot admissible for anypurpose. Hawthorne Partners v. AT &T Technologies, Inc., 831 F. Supp.\n1398, 1400 (N.D. Ill. 1993); see also Telewizja Polska USA, Inc. v. Echostar Satellite Corp.,\n2005 WL 289967, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 4, 2005). Moreover, the party seeking the exclusion of\nevidence in limine bears the burden of showing the propriety of such exclusion. Juracek v. City\nofO’Fallon,ILPoliceDep’t,2007 WL3407367, at*2(S.D.Ill.Nov.14, 2007)(denyingmotion\ninliminetoexcludewitness testimony).\nDefendants cite no case where a Court has granted a motion in limine precluding a\nplaintiff from testifying in his or her own case. As explained in greater detail below, the\ntestifying Plaintiffs (collectivelythe “Testifying Plaintiffs”) possess personal knowledge directly\nrelated to one or more of Plaintiffs’ claims.2 Accordingly, the Court should deny Defendants’\nMotion In Limine and rule on any objections as they are raised during the Testifying Plaintiffs’\ntrial testimony, when the Court can properly evaluate whether the testimony is admissible for its\nintended purpose. See Jonasson v. Lutheran Child & Family Serv., 115 F.3d 436, 440 (7th Cir.\n1997) (if evidence “cannot be evaluated accurately or sufficiently” in a motion in limine, “it is\n1 Plaintiffs clearly are mindful of the time limitations imposed by this Court. Plaintiffs\nplan to manage their presentation of evidence and cross-examination of Defendants’ witnesses\naccordingly.\n2 As set forth in the Pre-Hearing Order, Plaintiffs will call four Latino citizen Plaintiffs to\ntestify: Lou Sandoval, Ralph Rangel, Michelle Caballero, and Luis Sanabria (collectively the\n“Citizen Plaintiffs”). Pre-Hr’g Order at 2, Nov. 13, 2011 (Dkt. 126). In addition, Plaintiffs will\ncall four Congresspeople Plaintiffs to testify: Representative Judy Biggert, Representative Peter\nRoskam, Representative John Shimkus, and Representative Donald Manzullo (collectively the\n“CongressionalPlaintiffs”). Id.\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 3 of 17 PageID #:3099\nnecessary to defer rulings until during trial”); see also Greenwich Indus., L.P. v. Specialized\nSeating, Inc., 2003 WL 21148389, at *1 (N.D. Ill. May 16, 2003) (“Motions in limine are\ndisfavored;admissibilityquestionsshouldberuleduponastheyariseattrial.”).\nI. TheBasicPremiseOf Defendants’MotionIs Flawed.\nDefendants’ Motion in Limine is laced with rank speculation and labors under the\nincorrect assumption that somehow Defendants should dictate how Plaintiffs present their case-\nin-chief, demanding that Plaintiffs rely only upon expert testimony. Defendants base their\narguments in favor of exclusion on limited deposition testimony in response to one-sided\nquestioning posed by the Defendants’ own attorneys. Defendants also complain that Plaintiffs\nhave disregarded their “requests to [P]laintiffs’ counsel to limit fact witnesses” duringthis “short\nhearing” (Mot. at 2) while ignoring that this is the Plaintiffs’ case and the Plaintiffs’ burden of\nproof.3 While complaining about the number of fact witnesses in their Motion in Limine, it is\ntelling that Defendants’ counsel never asked Plaintiffs during the lengthy meet and confer\nprocessaboutthesubjects ofthetestimonyweexpecttoelicitfromtheTestifyingPlaintiffs.\nPlaintiffs recognize that expert testimony will be of significant importance to prove their\nclaims, and they have allocated their 6 hour time allotment appropriately. That does not mean,\nhowever, that theTestifyingPlaintiffs should bebarred fromtakingthestand. “TheRules define\n3 Defendants’ counsel conveniently fails to acknowledge that Plaintiffs’ counsel\nconsistently has endeavored to conduct this hearing in an efficient manner in line with the\nCourt’s admonition that the parties should stipulate to as much as possible. Plaintiffs’ counsel\nhas received little cooperation from Defendants’ counsel in this regard. For example, Plaintiffs’\ncounsel proposed stipulating to the admissibility of everything in each side’s productions.\nDefendants’ counsel said no. Plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to stipulate to each side’s exhibit lists\nand again were rebuffed. Plaintiffs’ counsel further agreed to stipulate to all deposition exhibits;\nDefendants’ counsel refused. Defendants can hardly now claim that it is the Plaintiffs who are\nwastingthis Court’s time. Plaintiffs have everyintention to beas efficient as possiblein keeping\nwith the Court’s six hour time limit, but it should be Plaintiffs (and not the Defendants’) who\nchoosehowtousethattime.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 4 of 17 PageID #:3100\nrelevance broadly as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of a fact more\nprobable or less probable,” and a party is not limited to presenting only “the most probative\nevidence.” United States v. McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) (quotation marks\nomitted). Moreover, and contrary to Defendants’ assertions otherwise, fact witness testimony\nhas been used in prior redistricting cases. See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 561 F.3d 420, 427\n(5th Cir. 2009) (voters testified to vote manipulation); Sanchez v. State of Colo., 97 F.3d 1303,\n1321 (10th Cir. 1996) (public official testified to his appeal among Latino voters). It is these\nTestifying Plaintiffs who are harmed by the Illinois Congressional redistricting process and the\nCongressional reapportionment plan signed into law (hereinafter the “Adopted Plan”), so their\ntestimonyisunquestionablyrelevant.\nThe case law relied on by Defendants demonstrates the weakness of their position.\nDefendants cite Barnett v. Daley, 1995 WL 59229 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 10, 1995), and Illinois\nLegislative Redistricting Commission v. LaPaille, 786 F. Supp. 704 (N.D. Ill. 1992) to claim that\nfact witness testimony is insignificant in re-districting cases. While the Illinois Redistricting\ncourt observed that relianceon expert testimonywas common in redistrictingcases, 786 F.Supp.\n708-09, nowhere did the court state that fact witness testimony could not also be important.\nMoreover, in Barnett the court explicitly stated that fact witness testimony could be material to\nthe outcome. 1995 WL 59229, at *3 (observing that fact evidence consisting of “witnesses’\nobservationsofparticularincidentsbearingon afactinissue”and “witnesses who participatedin\nthe negotiations with defendants in developing the map at issue [observations] regarding the\ndefendants’ intent (such as why particular boundaries were drawn)” were proper areas of\ninquiry).\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 5 of 17 PageID #:3101\nSimilarly, Defendants resortto quotingthis Courtblatantlyout-of-contextto support their\nunsupportable position that the Testifying Plaintiffs should be barred from giving testimony.\nDefendants assert (at 1) that this Court stated that “I have already told (you) – we have told you\nthat we don’t think these witnesses are going to make a heck of a lot of difference.” Contraryto\nDefendants’ suggestion that this quote relates to the individual Plaintiffs, the Court actually was\ndiscussing Plaintiffs’ intended depositions of third parties Rockford Mayor Lawrence J.\nMorrissey, former Congressman William Lipinski, and Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. See\nReport of Proceedings dated Oct. 20, 2011 at 15-16. Also, Defendants’ Motion in Limine\nneglects to inform this Court that Defendants intend to call William Lipinski as a fact witness, as\nreflected in their witness list (Pre-Hr’g Order at 3), along with Juan Rangel who already has\naffirmatively testified that he knows nothing about the matters at issue in this case. Defendants’\nhypocritical request thus seeks the extraordinary relief of barring named Plaintiffs from\ntestifying—while permitting Defendants to call non-party fact witnesses at the same time—and\ninvites this Court to take an overly paternalistic and unnecessary role in micromanaging\nPlaintiffs’ case. The Motion in Limine should be rejected out of hand. Plaintiffs should be free\nto present relevant fact testimony by witnesses who possess requisite personal knowledge, and\nDefendants’attempttoprohibitsuchevidenceis ludicrous.\nII. The Testifying Plaintiffs Possess Knowledge Of The Allegations In The Amended\nComplaintAndThereforeShouldBePermittedToTestify.\nConsistent with Federal Rules of Evidence 602 and 701, the Testifying Plaintiffs only\nwill testify to matters about which they possess personal knowledge. See FED. R. EVID. 602\n(“Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the witness’ own\ntestimony.”). Fact witnesses clearly “mayoffer testimonybased on their personal observations.”\nNorton v. Schmitz, 2011 WL 4984488, at *4 (N.D. Ill. May 27, 2011) (denying motion in limine\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 6 of 17 PageID #:3102\nto preclude fact witnesses from testifying to personal knowledge); see also U.S. v. Williams, 81\nF.3d 1434, 1442 (7th Cir. 1996) (testimony of witness was admissible without “expert”\ndesignationbecauseitwasbasedonpersonalknowledge); seealso FED.R.EVID.701.\nDefendants have cited snippets of testimony from the various depositions in an effort to\nestablish that the Testifying Plaintiffs do not possess relevant knowledge while ignoring that fact\nthat Defendants controlled the questioning, much of which was objectionable for a variety of\nreasons. In particular, many questions lacked any foundation whatsoever. For example, in Luis\nSanabria’s deposition, without any prior questions or testimony regarding Mr. Sanabria’s\nknowledgeoforinvolvementwithanyinterestgroups,thefollowingexchangetookplace:\nQ: What did Latino interest groups from your congressional district -- first I think\nstartingwithfive--requestofthestatelegislatureduringthemappingprocess?\nMS.DOUGLAS:Objection,foundation,vagueandambiguous.\nBYTHE WITNESS:\nA. Ididn’tunderstandthequestion.\nBYMS.POMPER:\nQ. What position did Latino interest groups take on congressional -- how the\ncongressionaldistricts weredrawnin yourarea?\nMS. DOUGLAS: Objection, foundation, vague and ambiguous. I don’t think\nwe’ve established that he’s involved in any interest groups to have a basis to\nanswer.\nSanabria Dep. 16:16-17:4, Oct. 14, 2011 (Mot. Ex. I). This style of ineffectual questioning was\nconsistent throughout the depositions of the Citizen Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Sandoval Dep. 43:14-\n44:21, Sept. 30, 2011 (Mot. Ex. L); see also R. Rangel Dep. 24:16-26:14, Sept. 28, 2011\n(attached as Exhibit A4); Caballero Dep. 31:21-32:19, Oct. 24, 2011 (Mot. Ex. J). Quite clearly,\nPlaintiffs are not responsible for Defendants’ failure to elicit relevant testimony from the\nwitnesses at theirdepositions. SeeSchmuttev.Resort Condominiums International,L.L.C.,2006\n4 Defendants attached thedeposition transcriptforJuan Rangel rather than Ralph Rangelto\ntheir Motion in Limine. See Mot. Ex. K. For the Court’s reference, Plaintiffs attach the entirety\nofRalphRangel’sdepositiontranscriptas ExhibitAhereto.\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 7 of 17 PageID #:3103\nWL 3462656, at *7, *9 (S.D. Ind. Nov. 29, 2006) (denying motion to strike declaration\ntestimony that was not elicited at deposition, and noting that “[plaintiff] is not responsible for\nproviding [defendant] with information [about which defendant] made no effort to question” and\n“[plaintiff] cannot respond to questions that [defendant] failed to ask”). Indeed, Defendants’\ndeposition questions appeared to be aimed at establishing that the Testifying Plaintiffs are not\nredistricting experts, which Plaintiffs do not assert. Nor do Plaintiffs have any intention of\neliciting expert testimony from the Testifying Plaintiffs. The Testifying Plaintiffs should,\nhowever, be free to testify about any relevant matters about which they possess personal\nknowledge. Defendants cannot predict, based on generic, largely objectionable, and one-sided\ndeposition questions, precisely what the Congressional Plaintiffs or Citizen Plaintiffs will testify\nto. Thus,theirMotioninLimineisimproperandshouldbedenied.\nA. The Congressional Plaintiffs Should Be Free To Testify About The\nRedistricting Process, The Adopted Plan, And The Adopted Plan’s\nRamifications ToTheExtentTheyPossessPersonalKnowledge.\nAs demonstrated in their deposition testimony and as will be further set forth in the\nhearing, the Congressional Plaintiffs have personal knowledge about various aspects of the\nredistricting process, including their exclusion from the process, the creation of the Adopted\nPlan,andthe ramifications arisingfromtheAdoptedPlan.\n1. The Congressional Plaintiffs Possess Relevant Knowledge Regarding\nTheRedistrictingProcessAndCreationOfTheAdoptedPlan.\nThe Congressional Plaintiffs each possess knowledge of the redistricting process and\nshould not be barred from giving such testimony. In particular, Congressman Shimkus has\npersonal knowledge of the redistricting process based on the work that he did with Congressman\nCostello in a failed effort to create a bipartisan map as well as knowledge regarding the\nparticipants in the Illinois map making process. Shimkus Dep. 55:8-62:7; 67:9-74:20, Sept. 29,\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 8 of 17 PageID #:3104\n2011 (Mot. Ex. E). Furthermore, Defendants’ claim that the “whole topic area” related to\nCongressmen Costello and Shimkus’ workwith respect to theredistrictingprocess “is irrelevant”\nis farcical. See Mot. at 7. This Court has made it clear that circumstantial factors from which\ncourts may infer discriminatory intent “include the historical background of the decision; the\nspecific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision; [and] departures from the\nnormal procedural sequence . . . .” Op. and Order at 7-8 (Dkt. 77); see also Village of Arlington\nHeights v. Metro Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267-68 (1977). The interactions between\nCongressmen Shimkus and Costello during the redistricting process establish the “sequence of\nevents” as well as “departures from the normal procedural sequence,” making that evidence\nrelevanttotheintentionaldiscriminationinquiry.\nLikewise, Congressman Roskam has significant knowledge of the redistricting process\nbased on interactions with Illinois Senate President John Cullerton. In particular, Congressman\nRoskam has knowledge of the DCCC’s and Mr. Cullerton’s involvement in the process as well\nas Congressman Costello’s draft Congressional reapportionment plan. Roskam Dep. 14:1-14,\nSept. 29, 2011 (Mot. Ex. D). Congressman Roskam also has knowledge that the Democratic\nforces behind the drafting of the Adopted Plan intended to place an insurmountable hurdle in\nCongresswoman Biggert’s path to reelection. Id. at 14:13-14 (Congresswoman Biggert was\n“gone under any version of the map” that the Democrats planned to implement).\nCongresswoman Biggert, like Congressman Manzullo, will testify specifically about how the\nimportant redistricting principle of “community of interest” has been obliterated in the Adopted\nPlan based on her first-hand knowledge. In addition, Congresswoman Biggert has knowledge of\nCongressman Costello’s involvement with the redistrictingprocess, Biggert Dep. 9:16-10:4, Oct.\n10, 2011 (Mot. Ex. F), as well as the lack of involvement of Republican members of the Illinois\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 9 of 17 PageID #:3105\nCongressional delegation. Congresswoman Biggert also will testify about an important element\nof the manner in which the drawers of the Adopted Plan deviated from normal practices in the\ndisclosure of the Congressional redistricting plan for the first time publicly. Therefore, the\nCongressional Plaintiffs should be permitted to testifyto these matters related to the redistricting\nprocessand creationoftheAdoptedPlanaboutwhichtheyhavepersonalknowledge.\n2. TheCongressionalPlaintiffsCanTestifyAboutHowTheyWere\nExcludedFromTheRedistrictingProcess.\nCiting only one inapposite case to support their position, Defendants further assert that\nthe Congressional Plaintiffs should be foreclosed from testifying about how they were excluded\nfrom the redistricting process and how or why the Adopted Plan was created. In Alston v. King,\n231 F.3d 383, 387 (7th Cir. 2000), the case on which Defendants rely, the court—at trial, not on\na motion in limine—upheld the exclusion of testimonial evidence where the plaintiff repeatedly\n“failed to lay a proper foundation for testimony, or attempted to introduce testimony that called\nfor speculation or was based on hearsay” and thus failed “to adhere to basic principles of\nevidence in elicitingthe testimony.” Id. at 387-88. Here, Defendants’ onlybasis for challenging\nfuture testimony from the Plaintiffs’ fact witnesses is their responses to one-sided deposition\nquestions posed by the very party seeking to bar them. While Defendants guess that the\nCongressional Plaintiffs will provide only speculative, unfounded testimony, the Congressional\nPlaintiffs actually will testify with respect to topics on which they have personal knowledge,\nwhich is perfectly proper. See FED. R. EVID. 602, 701. Defendants cannot simply assume that\nPlaintiffs will not first lay the proper foundation before seeking testimony from the\nCongressional Plaintiffs. Rather, Plaintiffs will present “competent, admissible testimony” from\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 10 of 17 PageID #:3106\nthesewitnessesattrial. Alston,231 F.3d at387-88.5\nDefendants also mischaracterize the testimony of the Congressional Plaintiffs regarding\ntheir purported lack of attempts to participate in the redistricting process. Mot. at 5-6. The\nCongressional Plaintiffs are seasoned public officials, some of whom are formerstatelegislators,\nand are well-aware of fruitless political endeavors, particularly when it comes to dealing with\nSpringfield Democrats. As Congressman Shimkus testified, despite his diligent efforts to work\nwith Congressman Costello to create a bipartisan map, he did not speak to Senator Durbin,\nPresident Cullerton, or Congresswoman Schakowsky regarding the map because “they are\nknown to be highly-partisan Democrats who are focused on shifting the majority of Congress by\nthe gaining of six Congressional seats.” Shimkus Dep. 54:14-17. In addition, Congressman\nRoskam stated that “based on the conversations that I had with Senator Cullerton, it was clear\nthattherewas an agenda to moveamap forward that was goingto createa great advantageto the\nDemocrats and they weren’t interested in substantive input into it . . . . So could I have offered\ninput? Icould have. Ithink the political realitywas that decisions had largelybeen made at that\npoint and it wasn’t fruitful.” Roskam Dep. 38:4-15. The Congressional Plaintiffs’\nacknowledgementoftherealitythattheSpringfieldDemocratscould forcethrough anymap they\nwanted due to their control of the Illinois House, Senate, and Governor’s mansion should in no\nway foreclose them from testifying to such facts, particularly in light of Defendants’ intent to\noffer affirmative evidence of some purported failure to access the “public” portion of the\nredistricting process. See Shimkus Dep. at 62:16-19 (“[E]veryone knows that the Democrat\nmajorityin Springfield has carte blanche authority to pass legislation through both chambers and\n5 Defendants also seek to bar the Congressional Plaintiffs from testifying regarding the\nPlaintiffs’ proposed Fair Map. Mot. at 7-8. Plaintiffs do not intend to seek any testimony from\ntheTestifyingPlaintiffsregardingthe FairMap.\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 11 of 17 PageID #:3107\ngetagovernortosignit.”).\nMoreover, Defendants’ efforts to prevent the Congressional Plaintiffs from explaining\nwhy they did not participate in the farcical redistricting process is ironic. Defendants’ counsel\nextensivelyquestioned each Congressional Plaintiff on this verytopic. Furthermore, Defendants\ninsisted on the following stipulations: “No plaintiff ever appeared before any of the above\nredistricting committees or participated in any redistricting hearings the committees held” and\n“[n]o plaintiff ever submitted to any legislator or redistricting committee any proposed or\nsuggested map.” Joint Stip. Facts, Docs., Data ¶¶ 13-14. In light of this record indicating that\nDefendants themselves have made this topic an issue, they have no good faith basis to preclude\nPlaintiffs fromdefendingagainstthis speciousand misleadingargument.\n3. The Congressional Plaintiffs Should Be Free To Testify About The\nRamifications Of The Adopted Plan Based On Their Knowledge And\nPerceptions.\nDespite the Defendants’ objections, the Congressional Plaintiffs also should be permitted\nto testifyto the “ramifications”oftheAdopted Plan to theextent thatthevarious communities of\ninterest about which they have intimate knowledge will be harmed as a result of the Adopted\nPlan. See Von der Ruhr v. Immtech International, Inc.,570 F.3d 858, 862(7th Cir. 2009)\n(business owner could testify about expected harm to business because testimony was tied to\nwitness’s personal knowledge). Such testimony falls within Federal Rule of Evidence 701\nbecause it is opinion or inference testimony limited to those opinions or inferences which are\n“(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of\nthe witness’ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific,\ntechnical,orotherspecializedknowledge.” FED.R.EVID.701.\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 12 of 17 PageID #:3108\nCongresswoman Biggert, for example, need not speculate to competently testify about\nthe obvious harm that the Adopted Plan causes her constituents and the various communities of\ninterestin her currentdistrict. Herdistrictwas eviscerated undertheAdopted Plan (BiggertDep.\n50:11-51:6), dividing towns and separating communities in ways that are nonsensical and\ncontrary to core redistricting principles. Congresswoman Biggert has testified that the Adopted\nPlan “cut” the community located within former District 13 “into six different districts” despite\nthatdistricthavingmaintainedalmostthesameshapefor20 years. BiggertDep.50:24-51:5.\nThe same is true of the Rockford area from which Congressman Manzullo hails. For\nexample, Congressman Manzullo testified, (“I can give first-hand knowledge. I was born and\nraised in Rockford . . . . The way the map was drawn divides and segregates the . . . community\nin Rockford . . . . by roughly going down the Rock River on the west side and then reaching into\nthe east side and purposely grabbing those areas where Latinos and Africans live.”). See, e.g.,\nManzullo Dep. 17:13-21, Oct. 7, 2011 (Mot. Ex. B). In addition, Congressman Shimkus has\ntestified that “Madison County has historically, for 20 years, had two members of Congress.\nThis new map created three.” Shimkus Dep. 75:12-14. The Congressional Plaintiffs’ testimony\nclearlyis relevantbecausethepreservationof communitiesofinterestisoneofseveralfactors by\nwhich courts assess the motives behind a Congressional reapportionment. Thus, the\nCongressional Plaintiffs’ intended testimony with respect to the “ramifications” of the Adopted\nPlan will be based on personal knowledge from the impact that they already have experienced as\naresultoftheAdopted Plan’s passage.\nB. Defendants’ Hearsay Objections To The Congressional Plaintiffs’ Testimony\nAreMeritless.\nDefendants’ also improperly claim that the Congressional Plaintiffs should be precluded\nfrom testifying about out-of-court statements made by non-parties. As a threshold matter,\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 13 of 17 PageID #:3109\nDefendants ignore the fact that the Congressional Plaintiffs are entitled to testify about their side\nof the conversation as well as any understanding and impressions they had as a result of the\nconversations. Moreover, these out-of-court statements fall within well accepted exceptions to\nthehearsayrules.\n1. The Statements Fall Within The “Then Existing State Of Mind”\nHearsayException.\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3), out of court statements about a declarant’s\n“[t]hen existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition . . . such as intent, plan,\nmotive, design” are not excluded by the hearsay rule. FED. R. EVID. 803(3). In Catalan v.\nGMAC Mortgage Corp., 629 F.3d 676, 694 (7th Cir. 2011), the Seventh Circuit held that\ntestimony describing a bank loan officer’s statements that the bank would not approve a loan\nuntil the applicant resolved foreclosure issues was an “expression of the intention of the bank”\nand so even if hearsay, “the Rule 803(3) hearsay exception would apply.”6 The complained of\nstatements that Defendants reference all constitute evidence of intent, plan, motive, or design\nrelated to the redistricting process and the creation of the Adopted Plan that clearly fall within\nthe hearsay exception. For example, Congressman Roskam’s deposition testimony that Illinois\nSenate President Cullerton told him that “he had been in contact with the Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee, and . . . in his opinion, Judy Biggert, Congresswoman\nBiggert, was gone under any version of the map,” clearly conveys a plan regarding redistricting.\nSee Roskam Dep. 14:10-14. Likewise, when Congressman Costello told Congressman Shimkus\nthat he was “trying to have a less partisan map,” Costello clearly was speaking of his intentions\normotive. SeeShimkus Dep.56:19-20.\n6 Defendants’ reliance on United States v. Lane, 323 F.3d 568 (7th Cir. 2003) is hardlyhelpful. There, the\ncourtaffirmedarulingexcludinghearsayevidence,buttheissuewaswhethertheevidencewasproperlycategorized\nas hearsay. Id. at 384. The statements at issue here are admissible not because they are not hearsay, but rather\nbecausetheyfallunderthehearsayexceptionsofFED.R.EVID.803.\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 14 of 17 PageID #:3110\n2. The Statements Also Fall Within The “Present Sense Impression”\nHearsayException.\nThe Congressional Plaintiffs’ testimony regarding statements made by non-parties also\nare admissible under Rule 803(1) as present sense impressions. “[A]n out-of-court statement is\nnot excludable as hearsay, whether or not the declarant is available to testify, if the statement\n‘describ[es] or explain[s] an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the\nevent or condition, or immediately thereafter.’” U.S. v. Ruiz, 249 F.3d 643, 646 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(quoting FED. R. EVID. 803(1)) (affirming admission of witness testimony as to out of court\nstatements describing events under Rule 803(1)). “The underlying rationale of the present sense\nimpression exception is that substantial contemporaneity of event and statement minimizes\nunreliabilitydueto defective recollection or conscious fabrication.” United States v. Parker, 936\nF.2d 950, 954 (7th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted) (affirming admission of witness\ntestimony to out of court statement as present sense impression). The challenged testimony\nrelated to discussions with non-party individuals describes their perceptions of the redistricting\nprocess as it was unfolding. In particular, Congressman Shimkus testified that during the time\nthat they were trying to promote a bipartisan agreement, Congressman Costello told him that\n“Congressman Durbin, Schakowsky, and Cullerton look like they’re taking over the map\nprocess.” Shimkus Dep. 74:2-4; see also id. at 74:18-20 (testifying regarding Costello’s\nperception after his meeting in Springfield with legislative leaders that it “looked like Madigan\nwas walking away which confirmed [that] Cullerton [was] taking over the process”). Such in-\nthe-momentdescriptions arenotexcludableashearsay.\nD. The Citizen Plaintiffs Should Be Permitted To Testify About Matters To\nWhichThey HavePersonalKnowledge.\nWithout citing a single case in support of their extraordinary request, Defendants also\nseek to bar the Citizen Plaintiffs from testifying on their own behalf, claiming that the Citizen\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 15 of 17 PageID #:3111\nPlaintiffs “have as little knowledge about the issues raised in the amended complaint as do the\nCongressional[P]laintiffs.” Mot.at9. Defendants’assertions arebaseless.\nPlaintiffs cannot help but observe that Defendants continue to mischaracterize the\ndeposition testimony of the Plaintiff fact witnesses in an effort to bolster their arguments. For\nexample, Defendants claim that “without any analysis whatsoever, [Ralph] Rangel testified that\nhe is not really aware of the adopted map, but that it would create a potential of Spanish block\nother than District #4.” Mot. at 10. Mr. Rangel actually was testifying in response to a line of\nquestions posed about the Fair Map, and not the Adopted Plan, stating that his understanding\nwas that the Fair Map had the potential of creating a Spanish bloc in addition to the adopted\nFourthDistrict. R.RangelDep.30:22-31:3.\nIndeed,Defendants maintainthattheLatino Plaintiffswholivein theveryneighborhoods\nat issue have no ability to testify about the impact of the redistricting in their respective\ncommunities. Laughably, Defendants point to the fact that these Latino Plaintiffs have not\nstudied thedemographics oftheseneighborhoods, apparentlyforgettingthat theseindividuals are\npart of the demographics. For that matter, Defendants have represented that they will call Juan\nRangel as a fact witness, and Mr. Rangel certainly is not poring over demographic data in\npreparation for anytestimonyostensiblybased on his personal knowledge as a Latino.7 See Pre-\nHr’gOrderat3.\nThattheCitizen Plaintiffs havenot reliedupon “demographicdata”is utterlyirrelevantto\ntheir abilities to testify to their personal knowledge and the dilution of their votes due to the\n7 Plaintiffs have moved in limine to exclude testimony by Juan Rangel on other grounds,\nnamely that he repeatedly testified that he has no actual factual knowledge of anything\nconcerning the Illinois Congressional redistricting process or the Adopted Plan which would\nmake him competent to provide any testimony regarding the issues in this case. See Plaintiffs’\nMotionIn LimineToExcludeJuanRangel(Dkt.121).\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 16 of 17 PageID #:3112\npacking and fracturing of them and their neighbors. See Casares v. Bernal, 2011 WL 1988788,\nat *1 (N.D. Ill. May20, 2011) (denying motion in limine to exclude layopinion testimonybased\non personal knowledge); see also FED. R. EVID. 701. Moreover, the Citizen Plaintiffs have\nestablished – and will testify that – they have personal knowledge of their experiences as Latino\ncitizens and voters as well as knowledge of their neighborhoods. For example, Mr. Rangel\ntestified in his deposition that his knowledge was based on his “awareness of what has been\nhappening in my [Third] district with respect to the number of Hispanics that have been moving\ninto it.” R. Rangel Dep. 31:13-15. Likewise, Lou Sandoval testified that he based his\nknowledge not only upon review of the Adopted Plan but also “from living in the neighborhood\nand knowing my community as to where individuals reside, it’s very apparent that selection was\nbeing done of Hispanic residents to place them in a specific district, namely the fourth\ncongressionaldistrict.. . .” Sandoval Dep.21:14-18. As explainedbyMr. Rangel,theseCitizen\nPlaintiffs “live in the city”and are “awareof what is goingon in thevarious neighborhoods.” R.\nRangel Dep. at 31:19-20. Based on this knowledge and experience, Citizen Plaintiffs can testify\nwith respect to their observations of the changes within their communities as well as how they\nhave been impacted by the redistricting process and the Adopted Plan. The Citizen Plaintiffs\nshouldbefreetotestify.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny Defendants’\nMotioninLiminetoBarPlaintiffs’ Fact Witnesses.\n16\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 136 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 17 of 17 PageID #:3113\nDated: November15,2011 RespectfullySubmitted,\nBy: LoriE.Lightfoot\nTyroneC.

In the first place,\n1 In the parties’ November 15, 2011 Joint Stipulation of Facts, Documents, and Data, Defendants\nstipulated to the admissibility of one of the data compilation exhibits originally challenged in\nMotion in Limine #3—exhibit P-109—which shows demographic breakdowns in districts with\nLatino members of Congress. Joint Stip. Facts, Docs., Data ¶ 7. Defendants’ objection to\nexhibitP-109isthereforemoot.\n2 Defendants also challenge two news articles addressingthe process bywhich the Adopted Map\nwas enacted (exhibits P-56 and P-57), but Plaintiffs do not plan to use these exhibits to prove the\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:3130\nDefendants’ objections are premature, and premised upon misguided speculation about the\nintended use of the challenged exhibits. For that reason alone, Defendants’ motion must be\ndenied. In any event, each of Defendants’ objections fails on the merits because the challenged\nexhibits were timely produced, are directly relevant to this case, and fall within well-recognized\nexceptionstothehearsayrule. TheCourtshoulddenyDefendants’Motionin Limine#3.\nARGUMENT\nI. Defendants’MotionMustBeDeniedAsPremature.\nDefendants’ motion should be denied outright because the objections it raises are\npremature. A “court has the power to exclude evidence in limine only when evidence is clearly\ninadmissible on all potential grounds.” Hawthorne Partners v. AT&T Tech., Inc., 831 F. Supp.\n1398, 1400 (N.D. Ill. 1993). But Defendants object to the admissibility of exhibits on specific\ngrounds and for specific purposes, without knowing the context or the purpose for which each\nexhibit will be offered into evidence. Simply stated, the exhibits standing by themselves are not\nobjectionable if and until they have been offered into evidence. For example, Defendants’\nhearsay objections are beside the point if Plaintiffs introduce an exhibit at the hearing for\nimpeachment purposes, or for any purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted.\nSee FED.R.EVID. 801(c); United States v. Burt, 495 F.3d 733, 736-37 (7th Cir. 2007) (testimony\noffered for impeachment purposes is not hearsay). Similarly, Defendants’ relevance objections\nare grounded in speculation about the purposes for which Plaintiffs will offer the challenged\nexhibits. See Doc. 117 at 1, 4-5; see also Sec. III infra. Accordingly, the Court should deny\nDefendants’ motion and rule on their admissibility objections as each exhibit is offered into\nevidence, when the Court can properlyevaluate whethertheexhibit is admissibleforits intended\nrelevant facts about the enactment process at the hearing. Accordingly, Defendants’ objections\ntotheseexhibitsarenowmoot.\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:3131\npurpose. See Jonasson v. Lutheran Child & Family Serv., 115 F.3d 436, 440 (7th Cir. 1997) (if\nevidence “cannot be evaluated accurately or sufficiently” in a motion in limine, “it is necessary\nto defer rulings until during trial”); see also Greenwich Indus., L.P. v. Specialized Seating, Inc.,\n2003 WL 21148389, at *1 (N.D. Ill. May 16, 2003) (“Motions in limine are disfavored;\nadmissibilityquestionsshouldberuleduponastheyariseattrial.”).\nII. Defendants’MotionAlsoMustBeDeniedOnTheMerits.\nIf the Court chooses to consider Defendants’ timeliness, relevance, and hearsay\nobjections nowdespitetheirprematurity,the Court should stilldenyDefendants’ motion because\ntheseobjectionsaremeritless.\nA. Defendants’Timeliness ObjectionsAreUnfounded.\nDefendants repeatedly contest the timeliness of Plaintiffs’ disclosure of the challenged\nexhibits,suggestingalternativelythattheexhibitsshould havebeen disclosed beforethedeadline\nfor Plaintiffs’ initial expert reports on September 14, 2011, or that they should have been\ndisclosed before the close of fact discoveryon October 19, 2011. See Doc. 117 at pp. 3-4. Both\nsuggestions arewrong, and ignorethefactthatDefendants themselves,as recentlyas thenightof\nSunday,November13,2011,haveaddedexhibitstotheirexhibitlist.\nThe hypocrisy of Defendants’ position is underscored by the reality that they have not\nsuffered any prejudice by Plaintiffs’ compliance with the November 7, 2011 disclosure of\nhearing exhibits. The challenged exhibits are not documents upon which Plaintiffs’ experts\nrelied in their reports or plan to rely at the hearing, but documents that fall within recognized\nhearsay exceptions or other Rules of Evidence as set forth below and about which this Court can\ntake judicial notice. And, as Defendants themselves concede, the documents that were in\nPlaintiffs’ possession at the close of discovery were in fact disclosed at that time. See Doc. 117\natp.3(admittingthatsomeofthechallengedexhibitswereproducedonOctober19,2011).\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:3132\nAll of the challenged exhibits disclosed after October 19, 2011 are publicly-available\narticles,studies,anddata compilationsobtainedas partof Plaintiffs’legal researchinpreparation\nfortheupcominghearing. Pursuanttothis Court’sorder, Plaintiffs’ pre-hearingdisclosures were\ndue on November 7, 2011, see Doc. 100 at 2, and Plaintiffs disclosed each of the challenged\nexhibits on or before that date. Moreover, because the challenged exhibits are not documents on\nwhich Plaintiffs’ experts plan to rely and on which Defendants’ experts should therefore have a\nchancetocomment,Defendants’claims ofprejudicearemeritless.\nB. AllOfTheChallengedExhibits AreRelevant,AndTheRelevanceOf\nIndividualExhibitsFor SpecificPurposesCannotBeAssessedUntilThe\nHearing.\nDefendants also makethebold assertion that the challenged exhibits arewhollyirrelevant\nto Plaintiffs’ case. As Defendants themselves acknowledge, relevance is not a high threshold.\nSee Doc. 117 at 4. “The Rules define relevance broadly as evidence having any tendency to\nmake the existence of a fact more probable or less probable,” and a party is not limited to\npresenting “the most probative evidence.” United States v. McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th\nCir.2011)(quotation marks omitted). The first set ofexhibits challenged byDefendants—socio-\neconomic studies reporting the disadvantages and discrimination in education, employment, and\nhousing suffered by Latinos in Illinois (exhibits P-42, P-51, P-52, P-54, and P-55)—are highly\nrelevant to the totality of the circumstances analysis of intentional vote dilution in Districts 3, 4,\nand 5, as this Court has recognized. See Doc. 77 at 7 (listing “depressed socio-economic status\nattributable to inferior education and employment and housing discrimination” as relevant\nfactorsunderthetotalityofthecircumstances test).\nIn addition, the description of the Cook Partisan Voting Index in exhibit P-53 and the\ntable containing the Cook Partisan Voting Index for the 111th Congress in exhibit P-44 are\ndirectly relevant to determining whether the Adopted Plan complies with Plaintiffs’ proposed\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:3133\neffect standard for judging partisan gerrymander claims. Finally, exhibit P-58, a press release\nfrom the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights reporting that Congressman Luis\nGutierrez withdrew his endorsement of Congressman Dan Lipinski because of his poor voting\nrecord on immigration issues, is also highly relevant in light of arguments made by Defendants\nthat Congressman Dan Lipinski is the candidate of choice for Latinos. This absurd conclusion is\ncontradicted on manyfronts, not theleast of which is Lipinski’s rebuke by manymembers of the\nLatino community, includingCongressman Gutierrez. Should Defendants persist in arguing that\nCongressman Dan Lipinski is the candidate of choice for Latinos, evidence to the contrary is\nhighlyrelevantimpeachmentmaterial. Thus, allof the challenged exhibits areclearlyrelevantto\nthelegalandfactualissues inthiscase.\nFurthermore, the appropriate occasion to determine the relevance of individual exhibits is\nat the time they are introduced at the hearing and can be considered in context. See, e.g.,\nHawthorne Partners, 831 F. Supp. at 1400 (“[u]nless evidence meets th[e] high standard” of\nbeing “clearly inadmissible on all potential grounds,” “evidentiary rulings should be deferred\nuntil trial so that” issues such as “relevancy . . . may be resolved in proper context”); Casares v.\nBernal, 790 F. Supp. 2d 769, 755 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (by deferring rulings on motions in limine\n“until trial, . . . decisions can be better informed by the context, foundation, and relevance of the\ncontested evidence within the framework of the trial as a whole”). Challenging the relevance of\nthese exhibits now is premature and unnecessary, particularly in a bench trial. Moreover,\nPlaintiffs’ “proposed” exhibit list is, as its name makes clear, a list of exhibits Plaintiffs might\nuse at the hearing. The purposes for which Plaintiffs may use the exhibits will depend on the\nprogression of the hearing—undoubtedly some will be used for cross-examination purposes, but\nPlaintiffs cannot know which ones orhow theywill beused until the need arises,and neither can\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:3134\nDefendants. Indeed, Defendants’ relevance objections are based on nothing more than\nspeculation and conjecture as to potential uses for the challenged exhibits, which is proof in and\nof itself that their objections are premature. See, e.g., Doc. 117 at 1 (“some of the exhibits\nappear to be offered to support conclusions that require expert analysis . . .”); id. at 5 (“To the\nextent that these articles are being offered as a basis for an opinion on the totality-of-the-\ncircumstances test without the analysis of an expert, theymust be barred from use in this case.”).\nThe law is clear that if a motion in limine threatens to exclude even “potentially relevant”\nevidence, the relevance of an individual exhibit must be considered in context at the time it is\nintroduced at the hearing. See Payne v. Schneider Nat. Carriers, Inc., 2011 WL 1575422, at *1\n(S.D. Ill. Apr. 26, 2011); see also Jonasson, 115 F.3d at 440; Hawthorne Partners, 831 F. Supp.\nat1400.\nC. HearsayExceptionsApplyToAllRelevantPortionsOf The Challenged\nExhibits.\nDefendants further argue that no hearsay exceptions or exemptions apply to render the\nchallenged exhibits admissible. The inherent weakness of Defendants’ position is illustrated by\nthe fact that they cite only the definition of hearsay for this sweeping proposition, without\nconsidering the effect of the many hearsay exceptions, and without any attempt to engage\nmeaningfully with the content of individual exhibits. See Doc. 117 at 3. A proper hearsay\nanalysis reveals that one or more exceptions to the hearsay rule plainly apply to the relevant\nportions ofeach exhibit.\nData Compilations and Directories. The exhibits containing data compilations and\ndirectories from well-recognized sources (exhibits P-44 and P-53) are clearly admissible. First,\nthey fall under the hearsay exception in Rule 803(17) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which\napplies to “[m]arket quotations, tabulations, lists, directories, or other published compilations,\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:3135\ngenerally used and relied upon by the public or by persons in particular occupations.” FED. R.\nEVID. 803(17). Exhibit P-44 is a table published by the Cook Political Report setting forth the\nPartisan Voting Index for all Districts of the 111th Congress, an index widely relied upon by\npolitical scientists and by the general public to compare the competitiveness of Congressional\ndistricts.3 Similarly, Exhibit P-53 is a publication by the National Journal describing the Cook\nPartisan Voting Index as part of the Almanac of American Politics, one of the definitive\ndirectories for data on congressional districts, congressmen, and state senators.4 As directories\nand compilations generally relied upon by the public and by political scientists, these exhibits\nqualify under Rule 803(17). See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 515 F.2d 730, 732 n.4 (7th Cir.\n1975) (finding a book published by National Market Reports listing the wholesale and retail\nvalues ofcars admissible underRule803(17)).\nSecond, exhibit P-44, the table displaying the Cook Partisan Voting Index, also qualifies\nas a summary chart admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 1006. Rule 1006 provides that\n“[t]he contents of voluminous writings . . . which cannot conveniently be examined in court may\nbe presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation.” FED.R.EVID. 1006. Exhibit P-44\nsummarizes voluminous data in a waythat makes it accessible for the Court, and thus falls under\nRule 1006. See United States v. Alwan, 279 F.3d 431, 440 (7th Cir. 2002) (rejectingdefendant’s\nargument that an agent’s summary of his review of multiple transcripts “was hearsay,” because\n“Fed.R.Evid. 1006 specifically permits voluminous writings as a practical matter to be\nsummarized”).\n3 See The Cook Political Report, “The Cook Political Report Partisan Voter Index Explained,”\navailableat:http://cookpolitical.com/node/4201.\n4 See NationalJournal.com, “The Almanac of American Politics,” available at: www.\nnationaljournal.com/almanac.\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:3136\nThird, Defendants’ objections to exhibits P-44 and P-53 are conclusively undermined by\nthefactthe SupremeCourtroutinelyreliesondatacompilationsanddirectories fromsourceslike\nthe Almanac of American Politics in election law cases.5 The Supreme Court’s reliance on these\nsources demonstrates that they were appropriately cited in Plaintiffs’ Injunction Memorandum\nandshouldbeadmittedfortheCourt’sconsiderationatthehearing.\nSocio-Economic Studies. Defendants also object on hearsay grounds to the publicly-\navailable studies providing statistics regarding the socio-economic conditions of Latinos in\nIllinois (exhibits P-42, P-51, P-52, P-54, and P-55). The statistics in these studies plainly fall\nwithin the scope of Rule 803(17) as tabulations and compilations generally relied on by the\npublic.6 See FED. R. EVID. 803(17); see also, e.g., Johnson, 515 F.2d at 732 n.4; In re Sulfuric\nAcid Antitrust Litigation, 235 F.R.D. 646, 653 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (finding pricing data published in\na weekly newsletter admissible under Rule 803(17)). Moreover, courts routinely take judicial\nnotice of statistics and facts from documents on public websites that are capable of ready\ndetermination and not subject to reasonable dispute, further undercutting Defendants’ argument\n5 E.g., League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 410-11, 439 (2006) (citing\nthe Almanac of American Politics); Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74, 80 (1997) (same); Bush v.\nVera, 517 U.S. 952, 965, 973 (1996) (plurality opinion) (same); id. at 1041 n.37 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) (same); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 909 (1995) (same); see also Cao v. FEC,\n688 F.Supp.2d498,521-22(E.D.La.2010)(citingtheCookPoliticalReport).\n6 Defendants speculate that Plaintiffs might argue that these exhibits qualify as learned treatises\nunder the hearsay exception in Federal Rule of Evidence 803(18), which, as Defendants\nemphasize, only applies if the statement is called to the attention of an expert witness. See FED.\nR. EVID. 803(18). Defendants are correct that these articles are not discussed in Plaintiffs’\nexperts’ reports, and Plaintiffs do notintend to call theseexhibits totheirexperts’ attention atthe\nhearing. But Rule 803(18) also applies when learned treatises are “called to the attention of an\nexpert witness upon cross-examination.” Id. While Plaintiffs’ primary argument is that relevant\nportions of the socio-economic exhibits qualify as tabulations and compilations under Rule\n803(17), several might be used during cross-examination of Defendants’ expert, in which case\nRule803(18)wouldalso apply.\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 137 Filed: 11/15/11 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:3137\nthat the socio-economic studies should be stricken from the Injunction Memorandum and barred\natthehearing.7\nPress Release. Finally, Defendants challenge exhibit P-58, the press release published\nby the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights describing Congressman Dan\nLipinski’s poor voting record on immigration issues. Rule 803(21) of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence excuses statements of “[r]eputation of a person’s character among associates or in the\ncommunity” from the hearsay rule. FED. R. EVID. 803(21). The press release in exhibit P-58\nreports thatCongressman Dan Lipinski’s votingrecord so damaged his reputation that it losthim\nthe support of his colleague, Illinois’s lone Latino Congressman, Gutierrez. Because this exhibit\nbears on Lipinski’s reputation in his district and among his fellow congressmen for failing to\nrepresent his Latino constituents effectively, it qualifies under the hearsay exception in Rule\n803(21). See, e.g., United States v. Penson, 896 F.2d 1087, 1092-93 (7th Cir. 1990) (evidence\nthat a defendant performed similar acts in the past and could therefore be trusted by his co-\nconspirators qualified under Rule 803(21) as evidence of the defendant’s “‘good’ reputation in\nthe drug-trafficking community”). Moreover, it is commonplace for the Supreme Court in\nelection law cases to cite press reports and newspaper articles, underscoring the appropriateness\nofthis exhibit’s useatthehearingandits citationinPlaintiffs’ Injunction Memorandum.8\n7 E.g., Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1102 n.6 (9th Cir. 2011) (“we grant Dudum’s request for\njudicial notice of the City’s official election results as posted on the department website” as a\nfact “not subject to reasonable dispute” and “capable of accurate and ready determination by\nresort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned”) (quotation marks omitted);\nDaniels-Hallv.Nat’lEduc.Ass’n,629 F.3d992,998-99(9thCir.2010)(takingjudicialnoticeof\ninformation posted on a governmental website, the authenticity of which was undisputed);\nBarnett v.

Marshall, \nwho was identified by the Plaintiffs in the November 7, 2011 Pre-Hearing Order as a “may call” \nfact witness.1  However, Plaintiffs are effectively attempting to present expert testimony on their \npartisan gerrymander claims (Counts V and VI) by Marshall’s affidavit and attached exhibits \npurportedly  measuring  the  partisanship  of  districts  under  a  Partisan  Voting  Index  (“PVI”).  \nPlaintiffs never disclosed an expert on their partisan gerrymander claims, and Rule 701 does not \npermit a lay witness, such as Marshall, to offer expert testimony.   Because Plaintiffs did not \ndisclose an expert witness on the partisan gerrymander claims, Defendants did not disclose an \nexpert on Counts V and VI.  In addition, because Plaintiffs produced their PVI documents for the \nfirst time as attachments to the Permanent Injunction Motion on November 4, 2011, Defendants’ \nexpert, Allan Lichtman or any other expert Defendants may have disclosed, did not have the \nopportunity to rebut or respond to the PVI documents in defense expert reports.  In summary, \nwithout providing any notice whatsoever to Defendants that Plaintiffs are attempting to prove \ntheir partisanship claims through PVI, in their permanent injunction motion Plaintiffs now rely \nextensively on the PVI documents and testimony to prove their claims.  \nEven  were  this  Court  to  construe  the  PVI  evidence  as  appropriate  for  lay  opinion \ntestimony, the PVI evidence produced for the first time on the eve of trial violates this Court’s \ndiscovery order, which set September 17, 2011 as the date for Plaintiffs to have responded to   \nwritten  discovery  and  October  19,  2011  as  the  last  date  for  fact  depositions.  Defendants \npropounded written discovery to Plaintiffs on September 7, 2011, which the Court’s Scheduling \nOrder provided 10 days for Plaintiffs to respond.  Defendants asked specific interrogatories and \n                                                \n1 In their responses to the Defendants’ First Set of Interrogatories, the Plaintiffs also identified Marshall as an \nIndependent Contractor.  The Defendants chose not to depose Marshall only after confirming with the Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel on September 21, 2011 that Marshall had provided only technical consulting services regarding mapping.  \n2   \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 113 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:2336\ndocument  requests  about  Plaintiffs’  partisan  gerrymander  claims.   Plaintiffs’  responses  to \nDefendants’ discovery requests included no PVI data.    \nFor these reasons, all references to PVI in Plaintiffs’ permanent injunction memorandum \nand  supporting  affidavit  of  Marshall  and  exhibits  attached  thereto  should  be  stricken.   In \naddition, Plaintiffs should be barred at the hearing in this matter from referencing or eliciting \ntestimony on the PVI evidence or offering any exhibits on PVI. \nI.  PVI Portions of Marshall’s Affidavit   \nWhen it came time to disclose their expert witnesses, the Plaintiffs never identified \nMarshall.  Instead, they listed him in their discovery responses as an Independent Contractor, and \nnever provided additional information.   Yet, now, in their permanent injunction motion, the \nPlaintiffs are attempting to offer him up for essentially expert testimony regarding partisan \nvoting.  Fact witnesses may speak to those facts that are in the witness’s first-hand knowledge.  \nU.S. v. York, 572 F.3d 415, 420 (7th Cir. 2009); Sunstar, Inc. v. Alberto-Culver Co., Inc., 2006 \nWL 6505615 (N.D. Ill.), quoting U.S. v. Conn, 297 F.3d 548, 553-54 (7th Cir. 2002); see also \nAncho v. Pentek Corp., 157 F.3d 512, 515, 519 (7th Cir. 1998).   However, an expert, using \nhis/her “scientific, technological, or other specialized knowledge,” may speak to opinions or \ninferences that are drawn from facts outside of his/her first-hand knowledge.   Id.; FRE 702.  \nSuch opinions are not admissible as lay testimony from a fact witness.  York, 572 F.3d at 420; \nFRE 701(c).  Furthermore, a party seeking to use an expert must timely disclose him/her, along \nwith  a  written  summary  of  his/her  opinion,  prior  to  trial.   York,  572  F.3d  at  420;  FRCP \n26(a)(2)(D).  \nThe PVI portions of Marshall’s affidavit that should be stricken are paragraph 24 through \n34 on pages 7 through 9.  (Dkt 106-7).  In these paragraphs, Marshall introduces PVI scores for \n3  \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 113 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:2337\nthe 2001 Congressional Districts, 2011 Congressional Districts, and the Plaintiffs’ proposed \nCongressional  Districts,  based  on  a  methodology  developed  by  Charlie  Cook  of  the  Cook \nPolitical Report.  These scores, reflected in Tables B – D of the Affidavit on page 8, measure to \nwhat extent a district leans towards one political party or the other.  Marshall does not explain \nthe necessity of a PVI score nor whether the Cook PVI formula is accurate and reliable, but \nrather  simply  adopts  another  person’s  methodology  to  publish  calculations.   See  Marshall \nAffidavit, ¶¶ 24 – 25.    For these reasons, paragraphs 24 through 34 of Marshall’s affidavit \nshould be stricken.  In addition, were Plaintiffs to elect to call Marshall as a fact witness at trial, \nhe should be precluded from testifying about the PVI data. \nII.  PVI Documents Attached To Permanent Injunction Motion and Submitted as \nTrial Exhibits   \nIn their permanent injunction motion, Plaintiffs cite to the following PVI documents, \nwhich are also included in their proposed pretrial order.  The documents are cited differently in \nthe brief and pretrial order and are identified as followed:  \nMotion Exhibit No.                      Trial Exhibit No.  \nA54 (Dkt 106-5 at pp. 51-60)                     P-44  (Dkt 108 at p. 10 of 23)  \nA63  (Dkt 106-6 at pp. 30-37)          P-53   (Dkt 108 at p. 11 of 23) \n            B20 to B27 (Dkt 106-9 at pp. 5-20)            P-80 to P-87  (Dkt 108 at pp.12 of 23) \nB20 to B27 are analytic maps created by Marshall and are exhibits to his affidavit.  The maps \nvisually represent the scores of the Partisan Voting Index as measured by Marshall for certain \ncities and districts in Illinois under the Adopted Plan.  Marshall’s expert analysis in these maps is \nnot lay opinion testimony, and the exhibits therefore should be stricken from the permanent \ninjunction motion and barred from use at trial.  Moreover, were the analytic maps construed as \nfactual  data,  its  disclosure  on  the  eve  of  trial  is  untimely  and  would  severely  prejudice \n4  \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 113 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:2338\nDefendants were they to be admitted.    The cherry picking of a limited area in Illinois under \nthese maps should not be admitted when Defendants have not had the opportunity to rebut the \nPVI evidence or to present maps of areas not covered by Plaintiffs.  If the PVI documents would \nhave been produced during discovery in response to Defendants’ discovery requests on the \npartisanship claims, Defendants at least would have had an opportunity to rebut the evidence.   \nThis Court should also strike A54 and A63, which respectively are the Cook Political \nReport and the Almanac for American Politics’ definition of the Cook Partisan Voting Index. \nThe Cook Political Report provides the PVI Index for all of the districts in Congress. Plaintiffs \nnever produced this document or raw data during discovery, and have proffered no witness to \nopine about it at trial.  A54 and A63 were attached to the affidavit of one of Plaintiffs’ attorneys, \nwho is not a witness disclosed for trial.  For these reasons, A54/P-44 and A63/P-53 should be \nstricken from the permanent injunction motion and barred from use at trial. \nIII.  PVI References in Permanent Injunction Motion  \nOn  pages  35-37  and  pages  42-43  of  Plaintiffs’  memorandum  in  support  of  their \nPermanent Injunction Motion, Plaintiffs attempt to prove their partisanship gerrymander claims \nby offering an “effect” standard based on the PVI data.   As Plaintiffs failed to disclose the PVI \nevidence  and  theory  during  fact  and  expert  discovery,  their  arguments  on  PVI  in  the \naforementioned pages of their memorandum should be stricken, and further, Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ \nwitnesses and Plaintiffs’ counsel should be precluded from referring to or testifying about PVI \nduring the hearing in this matter.   \nWHEREFORE Defendants respectfully request that any reference to the Partisan Voting \nIndex in Plaintiffs’ Permanent Injunction Motion be stricken and that Plaintiffs be precluded \n5  \n\n      \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 113 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:2339\nfrom presenting testimony or exhibits regarding the Partisan Voting Index at the hearing in this \nmatter as specifically requested above.   \nDated:  November 10, 2011   Respectfully submitted, \nTHE ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.          \n                    /s/ Brent Stratton                          \n               Attorney for Defendants                           \nBrent D.

As the Complaint alleges, the State of Illinois has recently adopted a new map for\nthe state’s congressional districts (the “Proposed Congressional Plan”) that uses deliberate and\nunlawful gerrymandering to discriminate against Latino and Republican voters. The Proposed\nCongressional Plan unlawfully: (1) uses racial gerrymandering to create a majority Latino\ndistrict; (2) disenfranchises Latino voters by packing them into a single congressional district;\nand(3)is gerrymanderedtodiscriminateagainstRepublicanvoters.\n2. Despite the substantial legal problems facing the Proposed Congressional Plan,\nbeginning on September 6, 2011, the Defendants will enforce Illinois statute 10 ILCS 5/7-10 and\npermit prospective candidates to circulate petitions collectingthe signatures from voters within a\ncandidate’s prospective district that are required to place the candidate on the ballot for the 2012\n1 Plaintiffs intend to seek to permanently enjoin enforcement of P.A. 97-14 in its entirety\nafterthe completionofdiscoveryassetforthherein.\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 3 of 28 PageID #:89\nIllinois primary elections for the United States House of Representatives.2 There is no prospect\nthatthediscovery, motion practice, hearings,and rulings needed to resolve Plaintiffs’ claims will\nbe completed before September 6, 2011. Accordingly, in the absence of the preliminary\ninjunction requested in this motion, the period for circulating petitions will commence while the\nlegalityof the Proposed Congressional Plan and the congressional districts it creates is still (very\nmuch)indoubt.\n3. Furthermore, local and county election authorities throughout the State of Illinois\nare vested with the responsibility to take specific actions at the direction of the State Board of\nElections (the “Board”) to implement P.A. 97-14. See, e.g., 10 ILCS 5/11-1; 10 ILCS 5/11-2.\nOn information and belief, at the direction of the Board, local and county election authorities are\ninfact engaged inavarietyofactivitiesaimed atimplementingtheProposedCongressionalPlan,\nincluding but not limited to drawing precinct lines and sending out voter registration cards to\nregisteredvoters oftheirdistrictandprecinctlocations.\n4. To avoid irreparable injuries to voters and candidates forced to temporarily\noperate under a discriminatory congressional map that likely will be deemed invalid, Plaintiffs\nask the Court to preliminarily enjoin the Defendants from enforcing nomination petition\ndeadlines or otherwise enforcing the Proposed Congressional Plan. See Connor v. Johnson, 402\nU.S. 690, 693 (1971) (extending filing deadline for legislative candidates to an “appropriate\ndate”). Plaintiffs also request that the Court set forth a revised schedule for circulation and\nacceptance of petitions for nomination to commence November 5, 2011 or pursuant to whatever\nschedule the Court deems appropriate. Plaintiffs further ask that the Court order expedited\n2 The first day to circulate petitions for party nominations for the United States House of\nRepresentatives for the 2012 Illinois primary election is ninety days before the last day to file\npetitions,i.e.,September 6,2011. 10ILCS5/7-10.\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 4 of 28 PageID #:90\ndiscoveryand other proceedings to facilitate a prompt resolution of this matter before the current\nDecember5,2011deadlinetosubmitpetitions for congressionalprimaryelections.\nBACKGROUND\n5. Under Illinois law, the Illinois General Assembly and Governor have a duty to\nenact a plan for dividing the state into congressional districts based on the results of decennial\nfederal censuses. The current state government—which had to adopt congressional districts in\nthewakeofthe2010Census—isundertheunifiedpartisancontroloftheDemocraticParty.\n6. As set forth more fully in the Complaint (at ¶¶ 38-46), the Democratic leadership\nof the state Senate and House Redistricting Committees released a proposed congressional\ndistrict map at approximately 4:00 a.m. on Friday, May 27, 2011, only hours before the start of\nthe Memorial Day weekend. No public hearings were held on the released map. In committee\nand on the House floor, Republican state legislators questioned why the Democratic leadership\nfailed to have public hearings on the map, failed to explain why there was only one majority-\nLatino district, why the proposed districts appeared less compact than the current districts, and\nwhy the proposed districts divided recognized communities of interest. Nevertheless, on\nMemorial Day, May 30, 2011, the Illinois House of Representatives passed the Proposed\nCongressionalPlan on astraight partylinevote. The Illinois Senatepassed thebill thenext day,\nagain on a straight party line vote. On Friday, June 24, 2011, Governor Pat Quinn signed P.A.\n97-14intolaw.\n7. The Board and its eight members are charged with enforcing the Proposed\nCongressional Plan in connection with their responsibility to “[s]upervise the administration of\nthe registration and election laws throughout the State.” 10 ILCS 5/1A-8(12). Pursuant to 10\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 5 of 28 PageID #:91\nILCS 5/7-10, the Board will permit circulation of petitions for candidacy for the United States\nHouseofRepresentatives onSeptember6,2011.\nA. The Proposed Congressional Plan Dilutes Latino Votes And Uses Racial\nAndPartisanGerrymandering.\n8. The Proposed Congressional Plan packs excessive numbers of Latino voters into\nthe proposed fourth congressional district, unnecessarily “wasting” the supermajority of Latino\nvotes inthatdistrict,whilealsodilutingtheinfluenceof LatinovotersinproposedDistricts3and\n5. At 15.8% of Illinois’ total population, Latinos are now the largest minority group in the state\nof Illinois. Despite Illinois’ large and growing Latino population, the Proposed Congressional\nPlan contains onlyone majority-Latino district, District 4,outofthe18 districts created. Latinos\nmake up 65.92% of the proposed District 4 voting age population (“VAP”), far more than is\nnecessarytoallowtheelectionof acandidatewhoisthechoiceof Latino voters. SeeCompl.Ex.\nE. No other districtin theProposed Congressional Plan has a Latino VAP that exceeds 25%,but\n7otherdistricts haveaLatinoVAPthatexceeds10%. Seeid.\n9. The district with the nextlargest Latino population in the Proposed Congressional\nPlan is proposed District 3. Its VAP is 24.64% Latino, which represents a reduction in the\n29.31%LatinoVAPincurrentDistrict3. Seeid. Proposed District5’sVAPis16.05% Latino,a\nreduction from the 24.56% Latino VAP in current District 5. See id. Thus, the Proposed\nCongressional Plan dilutes the votes of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3, 4, and 5 by\nunnecessarily packing Latino voters into proposed District 4, thereby reducing the Latino voter\npopulationinproposedDistricts3and5.\n10. In addition, the State of Illinois used race as the predominant factor in shaping\nproposed District 4. Proposed District 4 is gerrymandered in an “earmuff” shape with the two\n“muffs” capturing two predominately Latino neighborhoods. See Compl. Ex. B. Those\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 6 of 28 PageID #:92\nneighborhoods are connected only by the earmuff’s “headband,” a narrow strip running along\nU.S. Interstate 294. In judicial proceedings followingthe 1990 census, a Latino-majoritydistrict\nwith a strikingly similar shape was created in the same location. Hastert v. State Bd. of\nElections, 777 F. Supp. 634 (N.D. Ill. 1991). At the time, the number of Latinos living in Cook\nCounty was roughly half of its current number, and it was believed that the “earmuff” district\nwas the only way to create a Latino-majority congressional district in Illinois. In subsequent\njudicial proceedings, this Court held that race was the predominant consideration in the creation\nof District 4. King v. State Bd. of Elections, 979 F. Supp. 582, 607 (N.D. Ill. 1996). Likewise,\nLatino ethnicity was the predominant consideration in the creation of proposed District 4 of the\nProposed Congressional Plan. No other factor explains the “earmuff” shape of the proposed\ndistrictortheextremelyhighconcentrationofLatinovoters intheproposeddistrict.\n11. Proposed District 4 is far less compact than other proposed districts. See Compl.\n¶¶ 63-66. A more compact and less bizarrely shaped majority-Latino district that respects\ntraditionalredistrictingprinciples couldhavebeen created,butwas not.\n12. TheProposed Congressional Plan also is apartisan gerrymanderaimed at creating\na Democratic majority in the Illinois congressional delegation. The proposed map fractures\ntraditional areas of Republican influence, such as DuPage County, across multiple districts,\nmany connected to traditional areas of Democratic strength. Proposed Districts 3 and 11 are\nespeciallyblatant examples of gerrymandering. Those two districts dismantle current District 13,\nrepresented by seven-term, Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert, the only woman in the\ncurrent Republican congressional delegation. The Proposed Congressional Plan slices current\nDistrict 13 into six proposed Districts (1, 3, 5, 6, 11, and 14) in order to dilute the influence of\nRepublican voters. It places Congresswoman Biggert into proposed District 5 with incumbent\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 7 of 28 PageID #:93\nDemocratic Congressman Mike Quigley while it weights proposed District 5 to favor a\nDemocratic candidate and draws the proposed district to contain 72% of Congressman Quigley’s\ncurrentdistrict,comparedtoonly1.43%ofCongresswomanBiggert’scurrentdistrict.\n13. Further evidencing its partisan animus, the Proposed Congressional Plan draws\nsome Republican incumbents into the same districts, forcing them to run against each other or\nmove, while it also places Republican incumbents in Democratic-leaning districts with\nDemocratic incumbents. The Proposed Congressional Plan does not place a single Democratic\nincumbentinthesameCongressionaldistrictasanotherDemocraticincumbent.\n14. As a result of the gerrymander, despite the 2010 congressional election results\nthat installed 11 Republicans and only 8 Democrats, the Proposed Congressional Plan creates a\nsituation inwhich theIllinois Congressionaldelegation is likelyto favorDemocrats 12 to 6 (with\nIllinoishavinglostoneseatduetotheresultsofthe2010Census).\nB. TheFairMapRepresentsA SuperiorRedistrictingAlternative.\n15. Plaintiffs propose the attached redistricting map (the “Fair Map”) that redresses\nthenumerousstatutoryandconstitutionalviolationsintheProposedCongressionalPlan. SeeEx.\nA (statewide map); Ex. B (Northeast Illinois map); Ex. C (Chicago area map); Ex. D\n(comparison to Proposed Congressional Plan); Ex. E (population analysis). The Fair Map\nremedies the Proposed Congressional Plan’s intentional dilution of Latino voters, respects\ntraditional race-neutral criteria while complying with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (the\n“VRA”), andrectifiestheDemocrats’backroompartisan gerrymander. TheFairMapisfarmore\ncompact than the Proposed Congressional Plan. The average Circularity Ratio of the Fair Map’s\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 8 of 28 PageID #:94\ndistricts is 0.37,whiletheaverage of the Proposed CongressionalPlan is only0.16.3 In addition,\nthe Fair Map eliminates the tortured “earmuff” shape of proposed District 4 while preserving a\nLatino VAP majority of 59.45% in Fair District 4. See Ex. E. Unpacking proposed District 4\nalsoproduces a46.51%LatinoVAPin FairDistrict3. Seeid.\nC. PlaintiffsChallengeTheProposedCongressionalPlan.\n16. On July 27, 2011, Plaintiffs filed this six-count action against Defendants.\nPlaintiffs allege that the Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally dilutes Latino votes, in\nviolation of Section 2 of the VRA (Count I), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment (Count II), and the Fifteenth Amendment (Count III). Plaintiffs also allege that the\nProposed Congressional Plan discriminates on the basis of race without being narrowly tailored\nto further a compelling state interest, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment (Count IV). Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the Proposed Congressional\nPlan is an unconstitutional political gerrymander, in violation of the First Amendment (Count V)\nandtheEqualProtection ClauseoftheFourteenth Amendment(CountVI).\nARGUMENT\nI. APreliminaryInjunctionIs NecessaryToPreventIrreparableHarmToPlaintiffs.\n17. To prevailon amotion forapreliminaryinjunction, “apartymust showthat it has\n(1) no adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is\ndenied and (2) some likelihood of success on the merits.” Ezell v. City of Chicago, --- F.3d ---,\n2011 WL 2623511, at *5 (7th Cir. July 6, 2011). If a “moving party meets these threshold\nrequirements, the district court weighs the factors against one another, assessing whether the\n3 The Circularity Ratio measures the area of a district to the area of a circle having the\nsameperimeter. Larger numbersindicatemorecompactness.\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 9 of 28 PageID #:95\nbalance of harms favors the moving party or whether the harm to the nonmoving party or the\npublicissufficientlyweightythattheinjunctionshouldbedenied.” Id.\nA. Without A Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm\nForWhichThereIsNo AdequateRemedyAtLaw.\n18. If a preliminary injunction is not granted, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm\nfor which theyhave no adequate remedy at law. Bypermittingcirculation of candidate petitions\nbased on, or otherwise implementing, the Proposed Congressional Plan, Defendants will be\nenforcing an unconstitutional redistricting plan that racially discriminates against Latino voters\nand constitutes a blatant and unlawful political gerrymander. There is no remedy at law for the\nirreparable harm that the Plaintiff voters will suffer in having their constitutional right to vote\ncompromised as a result of the implementation of the Proposed Congressional Plan. See, e.g.,\nSpiritLake Tribe v. Benson County, N.D.,2010 WL 4226614, at*4 (D.N.D. Oct.21,2010)(“An\nofficial action that has a disparate impact on the right to vote of a protected class under the\nVoting Rights Act, needs to be closely scrutinized as there is simply no remedy at law for such\nharmotherthananinjunction.”).\n19. Furthermore, if the Board continues with its present schedule and permits\ncirculation of congressional candidate petitions on September 6, 2011, the Plaintiffs who are\npotential congressional candidates face the burden of petitioning in congressional districts that\nmay not exist after this Court’s ruling on the merits of Plaintiffs’ Complaint. These prospective\ncandidates will be forced to accept the unlawful Proposed Congressional Plan to avoid being left\nbehind while other candidates circulate petitions for party nominations. In addition, potential\ncandidates’ petition efforts will be for naught if the Court later determines that the Proposed\nCongressionalPlanisillegal andmustberedrawn.\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 10 of 28 PageID #:96\n20. Allowingcandidates to circulatepetitions beforetheCourt rules on themerits will\ncause great confusion to voters. County and local election boards may incorrectly inform voters\nof their district and precinct locations, and have to re-contact voters once this case concludes.\nSignatures from voters whose districts later change will also be defective. 10 ILCS 5/7-10\n(signatures required from “electors residing in the political division”). Prospective candidates\nmay end up running in different districts. With all of these harms, candidates will be forced to\nscrutinize every past signature and likely start the petitioning process anew, causing voters to\nfaceasecondroundofpetitionsfordifferentcandidates. Unnecessaryconfusionis certain.\n21. No remedy at law exists to address these injuries. Money damages are plainly\ninadequate to compensate for an unconstitutional redistricting plan. See Spirit Lake Tribe, 2010\nWL 4226614, at *4. Thus, the preliminary injunction is necessary to protect the rights of all\nIllinoisvoters as wellas prospective Illinoiscongressionalcandidates.\nB. PlaintiffsHaveAReasonableLikelihoodOfSuccess OnTheMerits.\n22. Even now, beforePlaintiffs havehad theopportunityto take thediscoveryneeded\nto definitely prove all of their allegations, there is ample publicly available information for\nPlaintiffs to establish the necessary “some likelihood of success” to obtain a preliminary\ninjunction. SeeEzell,2011 WL2623511,at*5.\n23. First, the Proposed Congressional Plan is an unlawful racial gerrymander that\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. To prove that claim, Plaintiffs must show that “race was\nthe predominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant number of\nvoters within or without a particular district.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995).\nSuch a showing triggers strict scrutiny, with Defendants bearing the burden of proving that the\nmap is narrowlytailored to achieve a compellingstate interest. Shaw v.Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 915\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 11 of 28 PageID #:97\n(1996). A map drawn to comply with Section 2 of the VRA is not narrowly tailored unless its\nuse of racial discrimination is no more than “reasonably necessary to cure the anticipated § 2\nviolation.” Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 997 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring); accord League of\nUnited Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 519 (2006) (Scalia, J., concurring in the\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (“a State cannot use racial considerations to achieve\nresultsbeyondthosethat arerequiredtocomplywiththestatute”).\n24. Even without discoveryit is clear that race was the predominant factor behind the\ncreation of proposed District 4. No other reasonable explanation accounts for that district’s\ntortured earmuff shape, which connects a predominantly Latino community on Chicago’s near\nnorthwest side with a predominantly Latino community on Chicago’s near southwest side\nthrough a narrow band that runs along Interstate 294. Plus, proposed District 4 is substantially\nsimilar to the district that this Court created after the 1990 census to enfranchise Latinos when\nthat community was half its current size. Hastert v. State Bd. of Elections, 777 F. Supp. 634\n(N.D. Ill. 1991). This Court has already concluded that race predominated in the creation of that\ndistrict. King v. State Bd. of Elections, 979 F. Supp. 582, 607 (N.D. Ill. 1996). The same\nconclusioniswarranted here.\n25. Defendants cannot show that the Proposed Congressional Plan is narrowly\ntailored to complywith the VRA. The Proposed Congressional Plan disregards substantial gains\nin the Latino population over the last two decades and abandons traditional race-neutral\nprinciples such as compactness. It is possible to draw a far more narrowly tailored map that\ncomplies withSection2 oftheVRA.\n26. Theattached Fair Map is such a map. Fair District 4, with a 59.45% Latino VAP,\nreadily allows Latino voters to elect a candidate of their choice. See Ex. E. Moreover, the Fair\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 12 of 28 PageID #:98\nMap adheres to traditional race-neutral criteria such as compactness. While proposed District 4\nhas a circularity ratio of 0.05, Fair District 4 has a circularity ratio of 0.32. The substantially\nhigher circularity ratio of Fair District 4 indicates that the Fair Map is far more compact than the\nchallenged map.\n27. Because the Proposed Congressional Plan discriminates on the basis of race more\nthanisreasonablynecessarytocomplywithSection2oftheVRA,itviolates theConstitution.\n28. Second, the Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally discriminates against\nLatinos by diluting their votes. To succeed on the merits, Plaintiffs must show that that “‘under\nthe totalityof the circumstances, . . . the political processes leading to nomination or election . . .\nare not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens’” because of intentional\ndiscrimination. United States v. Brown, 561 F.3d 420, 432-33 (5th Cir. 2009); see also Rogers\nv.Lodge,458 U.S.613, 617 (1982). “‘[R]acial discrimination need onlybeonepurpose, and not\nevenaprimarypurpose, ofanofficialact’ foraviolationtooccur.” Brown,561 F.3dat433.\n29. Although discovery into the process by which the State of Illinois developed the\nProposed Congressional Plan will supply additional evidence, there already is “some likelihood”\nthat Plaintiffs will satisfy this test. Latinos comprise Illinois’ largest minority group at 15.8% of\nthe total population, but the Proposed Congressional Plan affords them with only one majority\nLatino district out of 18 total districts. That one district, packed with a supermajority of 65.92%\nLatino VAP, isolates far more Latino voters than necessary and thereby wastes Latinos’ votes.\nPacking Latino voters into proposed District 4 also allowed the State to intentionally reduce\nLatino VAP in neighboring districts and preserve them as white-dominated enclaves. Latino\nVAPdropped from29.31%in current District3 to 24.64%in proposed District 3 and plummeted\nfrom 24.56% in current District 5 to 16.05% in proposed District 5. Intentional discrimination\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 13 of 28 PageID #:99\nagainst Latinos likely caused this substantial dilution in Latino voting power. See Brown, 561\nF.3dat433(discriminatoryintentprovablethrough“directorindirectcircumstantialevidence”).\n30. Numerous “‘[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence’” further suggest\nthat the Proposed Congressional Plan is a product of racial discrimination. See Brown, 561 F.3d\nat 433. The State Redistricting Committees promised public hearings but blocked public\nquestioning of its members at those hearings. The Senate Redistricting Committee chairman\nfurtherpromisedto release theproposed map beforepublichearings butinstead released the map\nafter public hearings had concluded and at 4:00 a.m. on the Friday before Memorial Day\nweekend. The Proposed Congressional Plan cleared the Illinois legislature by the following\nTuesday,ensuringthepublic’s attentionwasdivertedovertheholidayweekend.\n31. Third, the Proposed Congressional Plan is an unconstitutional political\ngerrymander. By deftly redrawing congressional district boundaries, the Democratic-controlled\npolitical branches reversed the results of the 2010 election, turning Illinois from a State with 11\nRepublican and 8 Democratic representatives into a State with a likely 6 to 12 Republican\ndisadvantage. The proposed map fractures traditional Republican communities of interest, such\nas DuPageCounty, pits Republican incumbents againstone another, and places otherRepublican\nincumbents in safe Democratic districts. No Republican state legislator voted for the Proposed\nCongressionalPlan,and noDemocraticstatelegislatorvotedagainstit.\n32. Plaintiffs expect that discovery will reveal a wealth of additional lay and expert\nevidencethattheProposedCongressionalPlanis anunconstitutionalpoliticalgerrymander.\n33. Although the proper standard for judging political gerrymander claims has yet to\nbe articulated, the undeniable aggressiveness of the gerrymander enacted by the Proposed\nCongressional Plan violates the Constitution in atleast two ways. It penalizes Republican voters\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 14 of 28 PageID #:100\nfor their expression of political views and exercise of associational rights in violation of the First\nAmendment. It also discriminates against Republican voters in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 306-17 (2004)\n(Kennedy,J.,concurringinjudgment); Davisv.Bandemer,478U.S.109(1986).\n34. Because “some likelihood of success on the merits” exists under anyof Plaintiffs’\ncausesof action,apreliminaryinjunctionisnecessary. Ezell,2011 WL2623511,at*5.\nC. TheBalanceOf Harms WeighsInFavorOf Plaintiffs.\n35. The final consideration in ruling on a motion for preliminary injunctive relief\nrequires balancing “the irreparable harm the non-moving party will suffer if preliminary relief is\ngranted ... againsttheirreparableharm to the movingpartyif reliefis denied;and ... thepublic\ninterest, meaning the consequences of granting or denying the injunction to non-parties.” Abbott\nLabs.v.MeadJohnson &Co.,971 F.2d6,11-12 (7thCir.1992).\n36. Here, the balance of harms weighs greatly in favor of a preliminary injunction.\nThe harm to Defendants or the voters from a preliminary injunction is minimal. Entry of a\npreliminary injunction will serve only to temporarily delay the circulation of petitions and will\navoid duplicative work and confusion if the district boundaries are changed. With expedited\ndiscovery and case management, there will be ample time for Defendants and prospective\ncandidates to obtain signatures for petitions for primary elections, for those elections to be held,\nandforasubsequentgeneralelectionthatcomplies withfederalandstatelaw.\n37. Whatever modest harms, if any, are visited on Defendants, they pale in\ncomparison to thoseresultingif no injunction issues. As theSupreme Court has recognized, “No\nright is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who\nmake the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic,\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 24 Filed: 08/04/11 Page 15 of 28 PageID #:101\nare illusoryif the right to vote is undermined. Our Constitution leaves no room for classification\nof people in a way that unnecessarily abridges this right.” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17-\n18 (1964). The Proposed Congressional Plan abridges this right through intentional vote\ndilution, unconstitutional racial gerrymandering, and unlawful partisan gerrymandering. Given\nthe momentous interests at stake in this litigation, the harm to Plaintiffs and to the public of\nimplementinganunconstitutionalandunlawfulredistrictingplanis extreme.\nII. Expediting Discovery And Other Proceedings Is Necessary To Resolve This Matter\nEfficientlyAndCompletely.\n38. Courts have inherent power to control their docket and manage discovery to\nfurther the interests of justice. See, e.g., A. Bauer Mech., Inc. v. Joint Arbitration Bd., 562 F.3d\n784, 790 (7th Cir. 2009). Expedited discovery can provide “a fuller record for the court when\ndeciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction.” Nobel Biocare USA, Inc. v. Lynch, 1999\nWL958501,at*4(N.D.Ill.Sept.15,1999); seealsoVMS/PCALtd.P’shipv.PCAPartnersLtd.\nP’ship, 727 F. Supp. 1167, 1168-69 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (parties engaged in expedited discovery\npendinghearingonpreliminaryinjunction).\n39. Here, expedited discovery clearly is warranted in light of the looming 2012\nelection season, which is directly impacted by the Proposed Congressional Plan at issue in this\naction. Pursuant to 10 ILCS 5/7-12, as recently amended by Public Act 96-1008, the first day to\nfile completed petitions for party nominations for United States Congress for the 2012 Illinois\nprimary election is November 28, 2011.

Duringtoday’s hearing,\nthe Court asked for the parties’ positions on consolidating this matter with litigation challenging\nthe validity of districts for the Illinois General Assembly, which is currently pending before a\nthree-judge Court comprised of Circuit Judge Diane S. Sykes, District Judge Elaine E. Bucklo\n(N.D. Ill.) and District Judge Philip P. Simon (N.D. Ind.). Radogno, et al. v. Illinois State Board\nof Elections, et al., No.11-c-4884. As stated inCourt today,plaintiffs do not believethereis any\nbasis for consolidating this matter with the Radogno matter and therefore oppose it. Plaintiffs\nsubmit this lettertomorefullyexplaintheirposition.\nAs you are aware, Local Rule 40.4 governs the management of related cases. According to\nsubsection (a) of the Rule, “[t]wo or more civil cases may be related if one or more of the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1) the cases involve the same property; (2) the cases involve\nsome of the same issues of fact or law; (3) the cases grow out of the same transaction or\noccurrence; or (4) in class action suits, one or more of the classes involved in the cases is or are\nthesame.”\nIn addition, under subsection (b) of the Rule, a related case maybe “reassigned to the calendar of\nanother judge” only if each of the following criteria is met: (1) both cases are pending in this\nCourt; (2) the handling of both cases by the same judge is likely to result in a substantial saving\nofjudicial timeand effort; (3)theearlier casehas not progressed tothepoint where designatinga\nlater filed case as related would be likely to delay the proceedings in the earlier case\nsubstantially; and(4)the cases aresusceptibleofdispositioninasingleproceeding.\nAs described below, there are substantial differences between the two cases, which demonstrate\nthat theyare not “related” cases. Some of the more significant differences between the two cases\ninclude:\nMayerBrownLLPoperatesincombinationwithourassociatedEnglishlimitedliabilitypartnership\nandHongKongpartnership(anditsassociatedentitiesinAsia)andisassociatedwithTauil&ChequerAdvogados,aBrazilianlawpartnership.\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 30 Filed: 08/09/11 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:132\nMayer Brown LLP\nHon.JoanH. Lefkow\nAugust 9,2011\nPage2\n Different Maps Are Challenged – Plaintiffs are challenging the validity of the state’s\n18 districts for the U.S. House of Representatives, whereas the Radogno plaintiffs are\nchallenging the validity of a total of 177 districts (59 senate and 118 representative\ndistricts) in the Illinois General Assembly. Not only are the proposed maps and districts\nobviously different, but so were the processes leading to the adoption of the maps (e.g.,\nprocedure for drafting the maps, process for public hearings, etc.), which will play a\ncritical role in deciding the merits of both cases. In addition, the number of districts that\nwill needtobe analyzed, andtheprocesses fordoingso, will differsubstantiallybetween\nthetwocases.\n The Theories of Liability Differ – Plaintiffs allege that Latino and Republican voters\nare disenfranchised by the congressional map recently signed into law and have alleged\nviolations of the Voting Rights Act, and the First, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth\nAmendments. By contrast, the Radogno plaintiffs also challenge disenfranchisement of\nAfrican-Americans, ask that the Illinois Voting Rights Act of 2011 be declared\nunconstitutional, and assert additional claims under Illinois state law – all causes of\naction not asserted in this case. Thus, the cases will require that substantially different\nelements beproved,includingthediscoverynecessarytosupport that proof.\n Scheduling – As the Court is aware, plaintiffs have filed a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction seeking to enjoin the September 6, 2011 date for the circulation of primary\npetitions and a motion for expedited discovery. The Radogno plaintiffs, however, have\nnot filed similar motions, and according to the July 27, 2011 Minute Order (Dkt. 18) in\nthat case,plantofilean amendedcomplaint byAugust 10,2011,withdefendants filinga\nmotion to dismiss by August 25, 2011. Accordingly, the two cases are already on far\ndifferent schedules.\n Jurisdictional Issues – Upon information and belief, it is possible that a motion might\nbe filed in the Radogno matter seeking to have that case heard by the Illinois Supreme\nCourt pursuant to ILL.CONST. art. IV, § 3(b), which provides: “The Supreme Court shall\nhave original and exclusive jurisdiction over actions concerning redistricting the House\nand Senate, which shall be initiated in the name of the People of the State by the\nAttorneyGeneral.” This provision, however, does not applyto the present matter, which\nonlychallenges congressional districts. As such, jurisdictional questions that might arise\nintheRadognomatterwill not ariseinthis case.\nEven if they could be deemed “related” cases, consolidation is not appropriate under subsection\n(b) of L.R. 40.4, because consolidation is not “likely to result in a substantial saving of judicial\ntimeandeffort”andthe cases arenot “susceptibleofdispositioninasingleproceeding.”\nFor all of these reasons, plaintiffs respectfully submit that consolidation is not appropriate and\nthat this Court shouldretainjurisdiction.\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 30 Filed: 08/09/11 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:133\nMayer Brown LLP\nHon.JoanH.

Miller, Jr.\n) (3-judge court convened pursuant to \nDefendants. ) 28 U.S.C. § 2284)\n MOTION TO QUASH CURRENT AND FUTURE SUBPOENAS \nIN VIOLATION OF THIS COURT’S ORDER \nNow come the defendants, ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS et. al, by and\nthrough their counsel, Special Assistant Attorneys General Larry R. Rogers, Sr. and Devon C.\nBruce, and in support of their motion states as follows:\nIntroduction\n1. Defendants hereby move to bar the plaintiffs from deposing Rockford Mayor Morrissey,\nCongressman Jackson, former Congressman William Lipinski and any other unidentified\nindividuals on three bases (1) the plaintiffs are attempting to depose these individuals in\nviolation of this court’s order of September 29, 2011; (2) the witnesses are irrelevant to\nthe issues raised in the plaintiffs’ complaint; and (3) it is fundamentally unfair that\nplaintiffs be allowed to conduct fact discovery in violation of this court’s order, after\ndefendants’ experts have been disclosed and deposed.\nPlaintiffs seek to depose these individuals in clear violation of this court’s order\n2. On August 11, 2011, this court entered a Discovery and Preliminary Pre-Trial Order\nwhich required that depositions of parties and non-parties be taken between September\n17, 2011 and October 5, 2011. (Exhibit A)\n3. By agreement of the parties, this court entered a subsequent case management order\nwhich extended the time to take any fact witness depositions until October 19, 2011.\n(Exhibit B)\n4. Since September 28, 2011, defense counsel has worked diligently to depose all of the\nindividuals that plaintiffs have disclosed as witnesses for trial.  Defense counsel has\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 81 Filed: 10/17/11 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:775\ndeposed the following individuals disclosed by plaintiffs as witnesses in this matter.\nA. Ralph Rangel September 28, 2011\nB. Representative John Shimkus September 29, 2011\nC. Representative Pete Roskam September 29, 2011\nD. Representative Robert Dold September 30, 2011\nE. Lou Sandoval September 30, 2011\nF. Representative Bobby Schilling October 3, 2011\nG. Representative Aaron Schock October 6, 2011\nH. Representative Randy Hultgren October 7, 2011\nI. Representative Donald Manzullo October 7, 2011\nJ. Representative Judith Biggert October 10, 2011\nK. Luis Sanabria October 14, 20111\n5. No party has sought or obtained leave of court to extend this court’s deadline of October\n19th, 2011 to depose additional fact witnesses (or previously unidentified individuals).\n6. On October 14, 2011, plaintiffs’ counsel, Lori Lightfoot, sent an email indicating to\ndefense counsel that the plaintiffs intended to depose Mayor Lawrence J. Morrissey,\nMayor of Rockford, IL on October 24, 2011.  (Exhibit C)  At no time prior to the email\nof October 14th has Mayor Lawrence J. Morrissey been identified as a fact witness by\neither party in this case.  At no time prior to this email did plaintiffs’ counsel indicate to\ndefense counsel that Mayor Morrissey was intended to be a witness at trial or that the\nplaintiffs’ counsel desired his deposition.\n7. On October 14, 2011, plaintiffs’ counsel, Lori Lightfoot, unilaterally issued a non-party\nsubpoena for Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr’s deposition on October 21, 2011.  At no\ntime has Congressman Jackson been identified by any party as a fact witness who will\ntestify in this case.  (Ex. D) At no time prior to issuing this subpoena did plaintiffs’\ncounsel indicate to defense counsel either orally or in writing that Congressman Jesse\nJackson, Jr. was a possible witness at trial or that plaintiffs’ counsel desired his\ndeposition.\n8. On the afternoon of October 17, 2011, defense counsel received an email from plaintiffs’\ncounsel, Lori Lightfoot, asking for a convenient time to depose former Congressman\nWilliam Lipinski.  Congressman Lipinski has never been identified as a witness at trial by\nany party in this case.\n1Defense counsel has agreed to depose three of plaintiffs’ identified witnesses beyond the\nOctober 19th date set by this court, namely the plaintiffs Committee for a Fair and Balanced Map’s\n30(b)(6) witness, Linda Waxweiller and Michelle Caballero.   These depositions have not proceeded due\nto the plaintiffs’ own witnesses’ schedule.  Out of a professional courtesy to plaintiffs’ counsel, defense\ncounsel has agreed to depose them after October 19th. \n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 81 Filed: 10/17/11 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:776\n9. These depositions are being sought for individuals who have never been identified as\nwitnesses in this trial by any party; without consultation or agreement of opposing\ncounsel and for deposition dates which are in clear violation of this court’s order\nrequiring all such depositions to be completed by October 19th.\nThese previously unidentified individuals are irrelevant to \nthe issues raised in plaintiffs’ complaint\n10. The court indicated during the hearing of September 29, 2011 that these cases are\nprimarily determined by expert testimony.  Judge Miller stated in relevant part, “and the\ncases that I have read seem to be primarily expert testimony based upon publicly available\ninformation.  Has nobody thought of this before?  Is there something unique about this\ncase that gives rise to a greater need for additional evidence?” (Exhibit E, Transcript of\nProceedings, p. 19) To this comment, plaintiffs’ counsel stated:\n        “No.  I think the cases actually end up doing both.  They end up certainly with a lot of\nexpert testimony about the viability of maps, the viability of particular districts, how lines\nare drawn, whether or not there is racial bloc voting.  All that information certainly plays\nout, but it’s usually also in the context of actually receiving information from the other\nside about how it was that they went about constructing their map, the data that they\nused, expert testimony that was used in constructing the map, how particular lines were\ndrawn.  And in many instances, for example, the actual people who drew the lines end up\nproviding testimony.” (Exhibit E, Transcript of Proceedings of September 29, 2011, p.\n20)\nTherefore, not only are these depositions that plaintiffs now seek being sought untimely,\nbut they are also irrelevant due to plaintiffs’ counsel’s own justification for deposing fact\nwitnesses.  It is undisputed that Mayor Morrissey, Congressman Jackson or former\nCongressman William Lipinski were not Illinois State Legislators in the Summer of 2011\nresponsible for “who drew the lines”.  Ironically, plaintiffs’ own witnesses have testified\nto the contrary, namely the plaintiffs have testified that Congressman Jackson was upset\nthat he was not included in the drawing of the map that was passed into law.  Thus, these\nindividuals (not even identified as potential trial witnesses) are irrelevant to the issues\nbased upon the plaintiffs’ counsel’s comments and the plaintiffs’ own testimony.\nPlaintiffs’ counsel seeks to depose their individuals after \nexpert discovery has been completed\n11. All of the parties’ experts have disclosed their opinions in this case.  The defendants’\nexperts’ depositions are taking place on October 20th and October 24th.  Not only are\nthese suggested depositions of Mayor Morrissey, Congressman Jackson and former\nCongressman Lipinski being sought in violation of this court’s order, but it is\nfundamentally unfair to allow the plaintiffs to unilaterally issue subpoenas or request\ndepositions of as yet unidentified witnesses after the completion of defendants’ experts’\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 81 Filed: 10/17/11 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:777\ndepositions.  Just as in any case, the defendants’ experts may review and/or rely upon\nthese deposition transcripts.  To allow later fact depositions here would potentially begin\na whole new round of expert disclosures and expert depositions from all parties.\nWherefore, defendants respectfully request that this court quash the subpoenas and\nrequests for deposition which were sent out in violation of this court’s order directed to Mayor\nLawrence J.

In support of \nthis motion, the Committee states as follows:\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n1. On July 27, 2011 Plaintiffs filed a six-count complaint challenging the legality of \nthe  Illinois  Congressional  reapportionment  plan,  adopted  as  Illinois  P.A.  97-14  (“Proposed \nCongressional  Plan”).    Plaintiffs’  Complaint  asserts  that  the  Proposed  Congressional  Plan \nviolates the Voting Rights Act, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the \nFifteenth Amendment, and the First Amendment as an unlawful racial and political gerrymander.\n2. On September 7, 2011, pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 30(b)(6), Defendants served \ntheir Notice on the Committee.  Attached to the Notice was a list of nine topics about which \n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 2 of 5 PageID #:216\nDefendants sought testimonyand documents.  See Ex. 1. On September 14, 2011 the Committee \nissued its objections to certain topics in the Notice.1  For the reasons stated below, the Committee \nrespectfully asks the Court to issue a Protective Order prohibiting discovery into topics 3, 5 and \n9 of the Notice and limiting topics 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as set forth herein.\nARGUMENT\nI. The Funding Of The Committee Has No Relevance To This Litigation. \n3. Topic 3 seeks information related to “[t]he funding of the Committee, including \nthe sources, amounts and dates on which the funds have been received and the circumstances and \nmethod of receipt, and anysolicitations for funding.”  Id. This topic has no relevance whatsoever \nto the claims or defenses in this litigation and instead serves only to harass the Committee.  \nWhen asked to describe the relevance of this request during a September 9 meet-and-confer, \ncounsel for Defendants stated that they would get back to counsel for the Committee.  The \nresponse,  which  came  by letter  that  same  day,  simply stated  “we  believe  this  material  is \ndiscoverable,” without any attempt to explain why topic 3 is relevant.  Ex. 2, Stratton 9/9/11 \nLetter.  The fact that Defendants have failed to describe the relevance of topic 3 demonstrates \nthat no such relevance exists. \n4. A court can limit the scope of a deposition if a subject falls outside the permissive \nboundaries of Rule 26. See NDK Crystal, Inc. v. Nipponkoa Ins. Co., Ltd., 2011 WL43093, at *6 \n(N.D. Ill. Jan. 4, 2011) (granting protective order on irrelevant inquiry).  Because topic 3 is so far \nafield of the claims and defenses in this litigation and Defendants have failed to articulate any \nbasis of relevance, the Court should prohibit discoveryinto it.  \nII.  The Committee’s Website Contains Statements From Non-Committee Authors For \nWhom The Committee Cannot Speak.\n   \n1 Defendants agreed during the meet-and-confer process to extend the deadline for filing a Motion for \nProtective Order to September 14, 2011. SeeEx. 2 infra.\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 3 of 5 PageID #:217\n5.  Defendants’ topic 5 seeks testimony and documents related to “[a]ll statements \ncontained on the Committee’s website, also known as myvoteshouldcount.com website.”  This \ntopic is vastlyoverbroad, duplicative, and unduly burdensome. \n6. As with many websites, myvoteshouldldcount.com displays content that is related \nto the interests of the organization, as well as content that comes from sources other than the \nCommittee itself.  For example, the Committee posts news articles about the redistricting process \nand the defects of the Proposed Congressional Map.  To the extent that the Committee has not \nauthored these materials, it should not be required to testify about the statements made by others \nin them.  Davis v. City of Springfield, Ill.,2009 WL 1542801, at *2 (C.D. Ill. Jun. 1, 2009) \n(“[O]rganizational designees are only required to testify about information that is “known or \nreasonably available to the organization.”).  Accordingly, the Committee requests that the Court \nenter a protective order limiting the scope of questioning under this topic to statements made by \nthe Committee itself.\nIII. Expert Discovery Is Premature, Duplicative, And Overbroad.\n7. Defendants’ topic 9 seeks testimony and documents related to “[c]onsultation or \nengagement of an expert by the Committee regarding the 2011 map for the State of Illinois’ \nCongressional Districts enacted as Illinois P.A. 97-14 or Plaintiffs’ proposed redistricting map, \nincluding any materials provided to that expert.”  Inquiry into this topic should be prohibited for \nnumerous reasons.\n8. First, to the extent that topic 9 seeks discovery into experts who are not expected \nto testify at trial, FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(4)(D) plainly prohibits such discovery.  See Sara Lee \nCorp. v. Kraft Foods Inc., 273 F.R.D. 416, 420 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (prohibiting discovery regarding \nnon-testifying expert).\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 4 of 5 PageID #:218\n9. Second, discovery into communications with experts is premature.  Defendants \nthemselves objected to such discovery in their September 6 discovery responses.  Ex. 3 at p.2, \nNo. 5 and at Answers to Interrogatories Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, and Responses to Requests for \nProduction Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.  This Court already has set a schedule for expert \ndiscovery and Defendants should not be allowed to circumvent that schedule through topic 9.  \nGiven  that  expert  depositions  will  occur  between  October  5  and  October  19,  and  that  the \ndepositions will inevitably cover permissible aspects of topic 9, requiring the Committee to \nrespond to this topic now would impose an unnecessaryburden on the Committee and needlessly \nduplicate discovery.\n10. Third,  it  is  unclear  what  Defendants  mean  by  “consultation…of  an  expert.”  \nDespite  the  Committee’s  request  for  clarification  during  the  September  9  meet-and-confer, \nDefendants did not clarify the meaning of this phrase.  See Ex. 2.  The Committee should not be \nrequired to prepare a Rule 30(b)(6) witness on a vague, undefined topic that, to the extent \npermissible under Rule 26(b)(4)(D), Defendants can otherwise inquire about with Plaintiffs’ \nexperts directly.  See Catt v. Affirmative Ins. Co., 2009 WL 1228605, at *5 (N.D. Ind. Apr. 30, \n2009) (Rule 30(b)(6) requires topics to be described with “reasonable particularity”).\nIV. Other Topics Which Require Limitations.\n11. The Committee has additional objections to the topics in the Notice.  Topics 1 and\n2 seek information that is overbroad and irrelevant to the claims at issue, such as addresses of \nCommittee members.  Moreover, the terms “founder” (topic 1), “member,” and “political party \naffiliation” (topics 1 and 2), are vague and undefined.  \n12. Topics 6 and 7, which request testimony about the basis of every allegation of the \nComplaint and statements made in the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, are vastly overbroad \non their face as they request testimony on (1) a range of issues too broad for any witness to \n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 5 of 5 PageID #:219\nmaster,  such  as  census  data,  (2)  alleged  facts  that  are  not  in  dispute,  such  as  the  date  of \nenactment of the law at issue,  (3) alleged facts that are in the public record, such as the \nresidences of other plaintiffs, and (4) legal arguments and theories. \n13. Lastly, topic 8, which requests testimony about the Plaintiffs’ proposed map, is \noverbroad and covers information protected form discovery.  Defendants are not entitled to map \ndrafts, revisions, alternative proposals, or information about persons involved in work that was \ndone at the direction of counsel or an expert. \nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, for the reasons stated herein, the Committee for a Fair and Balanced Map \nrespectfully requests that this Court grant its Motion for a Protective Order in its entirety.  \nDated:  September 14, 2011 Respectfullysubmitted,\nCOMMITTEE FOR A FAIR AND \nBALANCED MAP\n/s/ Lori Lightfoot            \nOne of Its Attorneys\nTyrone C.

Lightfoot \nMs. Dana S. Douglas \nMr. Thomas V. Panoff \nMayer Brown, LLP \n71 S. Wacker Drive \nChicago, IL 60606 \nRe:  Committee for a Fair and Balanced Map, et al. v. Illinois State Board of \nElections, et aI., No. 11 C 5065 \nDear Counsel: \nThis letter states our position with respect to the issues discussed during our telephone \nconversation today regarding Defendants' discovery. \nFirst, with respect to the Congressional Plaintiffs, it is our position that all such Plaintiffs \nmust be prepared to sit for depositions at our offices as noticed.  Naturally, we understand that \nwe will have to accommodate their schedules as to specific dates, although within the time \nallotted for fact depositions by the Court's Scheduling Order.  At this moment, we have no \npreference as to the order of the depositions. Should we determine that we have a preference \nregarding the order, we will let you know by next week. To the extent that you inform us that it is \nimpossible for one or more of them to be present at our offices during that time period, we will \nconsider your position and endeavor to work out a mutually-agreeable time and place, although \nagain within the time allotted by the Court. Additionally, we will make ourselves available at \nvirtually any time if that would assist in scheduling the depositions. \nSecond, with respect to Item nos. 3 and 9 of our 30(b)(6) Deposition Notice, we believe \nthis material is discoverable. We understand that it is your position that it is not relevant, in \nwhich case we request that you confirm your position in writing. \nThird, with respect to your objection that we have exceeded the number of permitted \ninterrogatories, we respectfully disagree.  The majority of our interrogatories that you suggest \ncontain subparts merely regard a request for certain identifying information and often very \nclosely track the interrogatories you sent us (which, if your presumed definition of subparts were \napplied, also would have exceeded the number permitted).  If you disagree, then we might be at \nan impasse. \nFourth, with respect to your concerns regarding \"CVAP\" in Interrogatory no. 7, the \npreferred candidate inquiry in Interrogatory nos. 18 and 19, and the election analyses inquired \ninto by Interrogatory nos. 20 and 21, we believe such material is discoverable. However, if you \nare either not in possession or control of such information, or believe some of it is protected by \n500 South Second Street, Springfield, Illinois  62706 •  (217) 782-1090 •  TTY: (877) 844-5461 •  Fax: (217) 782-7046 \n100 West Randolph Street, Chicago, Illinois  60601 •  (312) 814-3000 •  TTY: (800) 964-3013 •  Fax: (312) 814-3806 \n1001 East Main, Carbondale, Illinois 62901 •  (618) 529-6400 •  'TTY: (877) 675-9339 •  Fax: (618) 529-6416  .~-\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47-1 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 8 of 24 PageID #:227\nMs. Lori E. Lightfoot \nMs. Dana Douglas \nMr. Thomas Panoff \nSeptember 9,2011 \nPage 2 \nRule 26 or otherwise should not be provided, please state your position in your response. To be \nclear, though; we do not expect you to obtain information not in your possession or control to \ncreate answers to these interrogatories.  On a related note, since the only mention of precinct \nanalyses comes in our requests to produce, we believe it should be provided to the extent you \npossess or control such documents. \nFifth, regarding Interrogatory nos. 18 and 19, the caselaw makes it clear that historical \nanalyses of past voting patterns and results is a part of analyzing Racial Dilution or \nGerrymandering Claims. Therefore, such information going back to 2002 is relevant and \ndiscoverable. \nSixth, as to the definition of the term \"district demographics\" in Request to Produce no. \n2, please be advised we are seeking information regarding age, citizenship, race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, and any relevant political party affiliation or registration and voting data. \nSeventh, to the extent that you believe that Request to Produce nos. 6 and 7 are \nimproper because they are not limited in temporal scope, we are willing to limit the timeframe to \nJanuary 1, 2002 to the present. \nEighth, as to the \"voting behavior\" inquired into by Request to Produce no. 7, we are \nspecifically seeking information regarding voters' candidate preference and voter turnout. \nNinth, with respect to your concerns regarding Request to Produce nos. 15 and 16, we \nnote that this language is nearly identical to the language contained in the subpoenas your \nclients served on 11 different persons and entities.  We similarly are not requesting, or \nexpecting to receive, anything improper or privileged. \nFinally, if you decide to file motion for a protective order, we will agree to extend the time \nto file until September 14, 2011. \nIf you seek clarification as to any of these issues, or would like to discuss them further, I \nwould be happy to speak with you. Just let me know what time would work for you. \nOtherwise, per your request during today's telephone discussion to set a time on \nMonday to confer regarding Defendants' discovery responses, we are available most of the \nday.

MCGUFFAGE, \nJESSE R. SMART, BRYAN' A SCHNEIDER, BETTY 1.COFFRIN, HAROLD D. BYERS, JUDITH \nC. RICE,  CHARLES W.  SCHOLZ, and ERNEST L. GOWEN (collectively,  \"the Defendants\"), \npursuant to Rules 33 and 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, respond to the Plaintiffs' First \nSet of Requests for Production and Interrogatories as follows: \nGENERAL OBJECTIONS \nI.  The Defendants object to the Plaintiffs' interrogatories and document requests to the \nextent that they seek to impose obligations that are greater than those imposed by Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 33 and 34 or any other local rule or applicable law. \n2.  The Defendants object to the Plaintiffs' interrogatories and document requests to the \nextent that they seek information subject to the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product \ndoctrine, the common interest doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or doctrine. \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47-1 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 11 of 24 PageID #:230\n3.  The Defendants object to the Plaintiffs' interrogatories and document requests to the \nextent that they are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and/or seek information or \ndocuments that are neither relevant nor likely to lead to admissible evidence in this case. \n4.  The  Defendants  object  to  the  Plaintiffs'  interrogatories  and  document  requests \ninsofar as they seek information in possession of the Plaintiffs or third parties. \n5.  The Defendants object to the Plaintiffs' interrogatories and document requests to \nthe extent that they prematurely seek information or documents relating to, or reports by, experts \nor consultants retained pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2).  The Defendants \nwill provide all such materials to the Plaintiffs pursuant to the dictates of the Court's Scheduling \nOrder and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n6.  The Defendants object to the Plaintiffs' interrogatories and document requests to \nthe extent that, as defined in the Plaintiffs definition of \"You\" and \"Your,'; the Plaintiffs seek \nanswers and responses on behalf of or regarding former employees, personnel, attorneys, agents, \ninvestigators, experts,  board  members,  officers,  directors,  representatives, or anyone  acting  in \ncooperation or concert with them. \n7.  Where the Defendants agree to produce documents, they do so only to the extent they \ncurrently have possession,  custody, or control of any responsive  documents.  The Defendants' \nagreement to produce documents in response to any request is not an admission that the Defendants \ncurrently have possession, custody, or control of any documents responsive to that request. \n8.  The Defendants'  decision to answer and respond notwithstanding the objectionable \nnature of any of these interrogatories or document requests should not be construed as a waiver of \nany or all of these general objections. \n2\n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47-1 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 12 of 24 PageID #:231\n9.  The Defendants reserve the right to supplement their answers  and responses to the \nPlaintiffs' interrogatories and document requests, respectively, as appropriate. \n10.

Subject to  these  objections  and  without waiving the  same, the  Defendants  answer as \nfollows  below.  The  following  members  were  not  part  of any  relevant  subcommittee  or \ndepartment. \nThe Illinois State Board of Elections' (the \"Board\") members as of July 1,2011 are: \nWILLIAM M.

REDNOUR  Term started:  October 26,2005 \nTerm started:  February 25, 1988 \nInterrogatory  No.2:  Identify  all  Persons,including  but  not  limited  to  interns,  staff \nmembers, employees, personnel, elected officials, and any other agents or representatives \nof  the  Board  who  were  involved  in  the  planning,  development,  negotiation,  drawing, \nrevision, re-drawing, and/or implementation of the  Proposed Congressional Plan or any \nother potential  or proposed  Illinois  Congressional Redistricting  plan.  For each  Person \nidentified in response to this interrogatory, identify and describe: \n(a)  the Person's name, address, telephone number, and employer; \n(b)  the Person's involvement; and \n(c)  the 'time period of the Person's involvement. \nANSWER:  The  Defendants  object to  this  interrogatory  on  the  grounds  that  it  is \ncompound, overly broad, vague, ambiguous, unduly burdensome, and requests information that \nis outside the  control of the  Board.  In additiofi,  the  Defendants object to this  interrogatory \ninsofar as it seeks information subject to the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product \ndoctrine, and the common interest doctrine.  Moreover, the Defendants object to the extent that \nthis interrogatory prematurely seeks information or documents relating to, or reports by, experts \nor consultants retained pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2).  Subject to these \nobjections and without waiving the same, the Defendants answer as follows: \nThe  Defendants  state  that  they  had  no  involvement  in  the  planning,  development, \nnegotiation, drawing, revision, or re-drawing of Illinois Public Act 97-14 (the \"Congressional \nmap\").  The Defendants further state that they are aware of the following persons' involvement \nin their implementation of the Congressional map: \nEric Donnewald, Director, (217) 782-1573 \nJayme Sims, Election Specialist, (217) 782-1570 \nBrian Zilm, Election Specialist, (217) 524-6171 \nBoard Election Training and Resource Development Division \n1020 South Spring Street \nSpringfield Illinois 62704 \n4\n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47-1 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 14 of 24 PageID #:233\nKyle Thomas, Director\n \nBoard Voter Registration Services Division\n \n1020 South Spring Street\n \nSpringfield Illinois 62704\n \n(217) 782-1590 \nTim Mapes, former Chief of Staff\n \nAnne Schaeffer\n \nOffice of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives\n \nBob Lindquist\n \nJillian Stanford\n \nKeith Croteau\n \nGIS Solutions\n \n2612 Farragut Drive\n \nSpringfield, Illinois 62704\n \n(217) 726-1501 \nThe Illinois General Assembly appropriated money to the Board in December 2008 in \norder for it to enter into a services contract with Election Data Services, a Virginia-based \ncompany.  The Board had no direct involvement with the performance requirements of the \ncontract. \nAs part of the Board's statutory duties, the Board's Voter Registration Services Division \n(the  \"VRSD\")  compiles  a  database  of  voter  registration  information  as  provided  to  it \nelectronically by the Election Authorities (\"EAs\") on a regular  basis,  usually  nightly.  This \nvoter  registration data  is available  to  registered  political  committees for  bona fide  political \npurposes,  and  to  governmental  entities  for  governmental  purposes,  but  not  for  commercial \nsolicitation or other business purposes.  On or about February 16, 2011, Anne Schaeffer, a staff \nperson  in the  Office  of the  Speaker  of the  Illinois  House  of Representatives, contacted the \nBoard to request voter registration information for redistricting purposes.  On or about February \n23, 2011, Kyle Thomas, Director of the VRSD, prepared data files containing voter registration \ninformation from December 2008 and December 2010.  These data files, which were provided \nto  Schaeffer,  contained the  information identified in,  and  were  in  the  same  format  as,  the \nattached document titled, \"Normalized Format.\" \nOn or about June 24, 2011, Eric Donnewa1d, Director of the Board's Election Training \nand Resource Development Division (the \"ET&RD\"), contacted Tim Mapes, then Chief ofStaff \nfor  the  Speaker  of the  Illinois  House  of Representatives,  in  order  to  obtain  a  copy  of the \nCongressional  boundaries  as  signed  into  law  that  day  via  lllinois  Public  Act  97-14  (the \n\"Congressional map\").  Mapes put Donnewald in touch with Schaeffer to make that request. \nDonnewald received  the  boundaries on or about  June  27, 2011  in the form  of \"shapefiles,\" \nwhich are files containing geospatial data.  The shapefiles were made publicly available on the \nBoard's Web site  at www.e1ections.i1.gov/shape/.  On  or about  June  27, 2011,  the  ET&RD \nmailed the shapefiles on compact disks (\"CDs\") along with a transmittal cover letter to all of the \n5 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47-1 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 15 of 24 PageID #:234\nEAs.  During this time period, the Board also responded to e-mails or telephone calls from \nEAs requesting information on when they were to expect the shapefiles. \nThe  Board  had  already  entered  into  a  contract  in  or  about  March  2011  with  GIS \nSolutions (\"GISS\"), a Springfield-based company, which has the software required to convert \nshapefiles into readable geographic descriptions, including maps, in order to create metes and \nbounds descriptions of the Congressional map as required by Illinois Public Act 97-14.  Bob \nLindquist,  a  GISS  employee,  was  in  charge  of converting  the  shapefiles  into  readable \ndescriptions.  Jamye Sims and Brian Zilm, Election Specialists in the ET&RD, checked for the \naccuracy  and  clarity  of the  descriptions  against the  map's boundaries  and,  as part  of their \nreview,  noted  any  situations  where  a  district  boundary  line  cut  through  a  commercial  or \nresidential building.  Per Illinois Public Act 97-14, the EAs are to place those residents that live \nin commercial or residential buildings that are split by a district boundary line into the lesser \npopulated district.  This review process is ongoing, but once completed, the readable geographic \ndescriptions  will  be  forwarded  to  the  EAs,  unless  specifically  requested  earlier,  and made \navailable on the Board's Web site. \nThe  Board  is currently working  with  GISS,  specifically lillian Stanford and  Keith \nCroteau, to implement a program that would allow the public to view future  Congressional \nand  legislative  maps  interactively  on  their  Web  site.  In  addition,  depending  on  the \nDemocratic and Republican state parties' ultimate plans regarding delegate allocation to their \nrespective, forthcoming national nominating conventions, some of the parties' delegates and \nalternate  delegates  may  be  elected  on  the  basis  of Congressional  Districts.  In  such \ncircumstances, the Board  calculates the Congressional District-based delegate and alternate \ndelegate allocations by:  utilizing a statutory allocation formula,  as chosen by each party; \ndetermining which precincts  fall  within  each  Congressional  District;  and  ascertaining the \nresults of past elections in each precinct and Congressional District as a whole. \nThe Defendants state further that they had, and continue to have, non-relevant internal \ncommunications  that  solely  regard  their  involvement  in  the  implementation  of  the \nCongressional map as described above. \nAll relevant, non-privileged documents  in the Defendants' possession relating to such \npersons' involvement are attached hereto. \nInterrogatory No.3:  Identify all Communications relating to the planning, development, \nnegotiation,  drawing,  revision,  re-drawing,  and/or  implementation  of  the  Proposed \nCongressional  Plan  or  any  other  potential  or  proposed  Illinois  Congressional \nRedistricting plan, including but not limited to, any such Communications with any of \nthe following Persons: \n(a)  Any Person identified in response to Interrogatory No.2; \n(b)  Defendants; \n(c)  DCCC; \n6 \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47-1 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 16 of 24 PageID #:235\n(d)\t  Any  present and  former  DCCC  staff,  personnel,  employees,  attorneys, \nagents, investigators, representatives, experts, consultants, or anyone else \nacting on the DCCC's behalf; \n(e)\t  Illinois House Redistricting Committee; \n(f)\t  Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee; \n(g)\t  Any member of the Illinois General Assembly; \n(h)\t  Any  present  and  former  Illinois  General  Assembly  staff,  personnel, \n. employees,\t  attorneys,  agents,  investigators,  representatives,  experts, \nconsultants,  or  anyone  else  acting  on  the  Illinois  General  Assembly's \nbehalf; \n(i)\t  Any current or former member of the United States Congress; \n(j)\t  Any  present  and  former  United  States  Congress  staff,  personnel, \nemployees,  attorneys,  agents,  investigators,  representatives,  experts, \nconsultants, or anyone else acting on the United States Congress' behalf; \n(k)\t  Any Interest Groups which testified at any Redistricting hearings; \n(I)\t  Governor Pat Quinn (\"Governor\"); and \n(m)\t  Any present and former Governor staff, personnel, employees, attorneys, \nagents, investigators, representatives, experts, consultants, or anyone else \nacting on the Governor's behalf. \nANSWER:  The  Defendants  object  to  this  interrogatory  on  the  grounds  that  it  is \ncompound, overly broad, vague, ambiguous, unduly burdensome, and requests information that \nis outside the  control  of the Board.

Subject to these \nobjections and without waiving the same, the Defendants direct the Plaintiffs to the Defendants' \nAnswer  to  Interrogatory  No.  2  for  a  full  description  of  those  relevant,  non-privileged \ncommunications of which they are aware. \nInterrogatory No.4:  Identify any and all expert(s) and/or consultant(s) with whom You \ncommunicated, directly or indirectly, regarding the  planning, development, negotiation, \ndrawing, revision, re-drawing, and/or implementation of the Proposed Congressional \nPlan or any other potential or proposed Illinois Congressional Redistricting plan.

Lightfoot \nMs. Dana S. Douglas \nMr. Thomas V. Panoff \nMayer Brown, LLP \n71 S. Wacker Drive \nChicago, IL 60606 \nRe:  Committee for a Fair and Balanced Map, et al. v. Illinois State Board of \nElections, et aI., No. 11 C 5065 \nDear Counsel: \nThis letter states our position with respect to the issues discussed during our telephone \nconversation today regarding Defendants' discovery. \nFirst, with respect to the Congressional Plaintiffs, it is our position that all such Plaintiffs \nmust be prepared to sit for depositions at our offices as noticed.  Naturally, we understand that \nwe will have to accommodate their schedules as to specific dates, although within the time \nallotted for fact depositions by the Court's Scheduling Order.  At this moment, we have no \npreference as to the order of the depositions. Should we determine that we have a preference \nregarding the order, we will let you know by next week. To the extent that you inform us that it is \nimpossible for one or more of them to be present at our offices during that time period, we will \nconsider your position and endeavor to work out a mutually-agreeable time and place, although \nagain within the time allotted by the Court. Additionally, we will make ourselves available at \nvirtually any time if that would assist in scheduling the depositions. \nSecond, with respect to Item nos. 3 and 9 of our 30(b)(6) Deposition Notice, we believe \nthis material is discoverable. We understand that it is your position that it is not relevant, in \nwhich case we request that you confirm your position in writing. \nThird, with respect to your objection that we have exceeded the number of permitted \ninterrogatories, we respectfully disagree.  The majority of our interrogatories that you suggest \ncontain subparts merely regard a request for certain identifying information and often very \nclosely track the interrogatories you sent us (which, if your presumed definition of subparts were \napplied, also would have exceeded the number permitted).  If you disagree, then we might be at \nan impasse. \nFourth, with respect to your concerns regarding \"CVAP\" in Interrogatory no. 7, the \npreferred candidate inquiry in Interrogatory nos. 18 and 19, and the election analyses inquired \ninto by Interrogatory nos. 20 and 21, we believe such material is discoverable. However, if you \nare either not in possession or control of such information, or believe some of it is protected by \n500 South Second Street, Springfield, Illinois  62706 •  (217) 782-1090 •  TTY: (877) 844-5461 •  Fax: (217) 782-7046 \n100 West Randolph Street, Chicago, Illinois  60601 •  (312) 814-3000 •  TTY: (800) 964-3013 •  Fax: (312) 814-3806 \n1001 East Main, Carbondale, Illinois 62901 •  (618) 529-6400 •  'TTY: (877) 675-9339 •  Fax: (618) 529-6416  .~-\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 47-3 Filed: 09/14/11 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:247\nMs. Lori E. Lightfoot \nMs. Dana Douglas \nMr. Thomas Panoff \nSeptember 9,2011 \nPage 2 \nRule 26 or otherwise should not be provided, please state your position in your response. To be \nclear, though; we do not expect you to obtain information not in your possession or control to \ncreate answers to these interrogatories.  On a related note, since the only mention of precinct \nanalyses comes in our requests to produce, we believe it should be provided to the extent you \npossess or control such documents. \nFifth, regarding Interrogatory nos. 18 and 19, the caselaw makes it clear that historical \nanalyses of past voting patterns and results is a part of analyzing Racial Dilution or \nGerrymandering Claims. Therefore, such information going back to 2002 is relevant and \ndiscoverable. \nSixth, as to the definition of the term \"district demographics\" in Request to Produce no. \n2, please be advised we are seeking information regarding age, citizenship, race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, and any relevant political party affiliation or registration and voting data. \nSeventh, to the extent that you believe that Request to Produce nos. 6 and 7 are \nimproper because they are not limited in temporal scope, we are willing to limit the timeframe to \nJanuary 1, 2002 to the present. \nEighth, as to the \"voting behavior\" inquired into by Request to Produce no. 7, we are \nspecifically seeking information regarding voters' candidate preference and voter turnout. \nNinth, with respect to your concerns regarding Request to Produce nos. 15 and 16, we \nnote that this language is nearly identical to the language contained in the subpoenas your \nclients served on 11 different persons and entities.  We similarly are not requesting, or \nexpecting to receive, anything improper or privileged. \nFinally, if you decide to file motion for a protective order, we will agree to extend the time \nto file until September 14, 2011. \nIf you seek clarification as to any of these issues, or would like to discuss them further, I \nwould be happy to speak with you. Just let me know what time would work for you. \nOtherwise, per your request during today's telephone discussion to set a time on \nMonday to confer regarding Defendants' discovery responses, we are available most of the \nday.  Please let us know what works best for you. \nBrent D.

The record at the close of expedited\ndiscoverynowconfirms thateachofPlaintiffs’claims has merit.\nWhile it may be true that Latino Democrats in the Illinois state legislature voted in favor\nof the Adopted Plan and Latino community groups have remained on the sidelines in this case,\nthe Adopted Plan unlawfully discriminates against Latinos. The record overwhelmingly\nestablishes that the Adopted Plan violates the Equal Protection Clause because race was the\npredominant factor motivating the shape of Adopted District 4 and the gerrymandered district is\nnot narrowly tailored to comply with any compelling interest. The record also makes clear that\nthe Adopted Plan intentionally and unlawfully dilutes the votes of Latinos by packing Latinos\ninto District 4, while it reduces the Latino population in neighboring Districts 3 and 5 to arrest\nthegrowingLatinocommunity’sinfluenceovercontestsinthosedistricts.\nAnd while political considerations often properly inform the redistricting process, the\nAdopted Plan takes partisan gerrymandering to an unconstitutional extreme.

Under anyreliable standard\nfor measuring the constitutionality of political gerrymanders, including the one that Plaintiffs\nhaveproposedintheir AmendedComplaint,theAdoptedPlanviolatestheConstitution.\nPlaintiffs’ motion for a permanent injunction should be granted. This Court should\ninvalidate the Adopted Plan and require Defendants to implement and enforce Plaintiffs’\nproposedredistrictingplan.\nBACKGROUND\nTop Democrats in the Illinois state legislature have publicly declared that the Adopted\nPlan resulted from “the most transparent, the most accountable, the most open redistricting\nprocess in the history of the state of Illinois.” Ex. A66. But nothing could be further from the\ntruth. The Adopted Plan was drawn through backroom channels by Illinois’s Democratic state\nlegislative leaders, Illinois’s Democratic members of the U.S. Congress, and the Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”). See Exs. A19-A33, A35 (e-mails and proposed\nmaps exchanged among map drafters). With respect to areas represented by Republicans, their\n(privately) stated intent was to “advance our goal—more Democratic pick-ups” (Ex. A19) and to\n“maximize Democratic performance” (Ex. A30). In other parts of the State, however, the\nmapmakers monitored and massaged the Latino voting age population (“VAP”) in crucial\ndistricts theywanted to keep safefor whiteincumbents in the faceof surgingLatino populations.\nSee, e.g., Ex. A25 (e-mail communicating Latino VAP to Rep. Lipinski’s staff); Ex. A1 at 15\n(LatinoshareofVAPin CookCountyjumped from11.5%in1990to20.8%in2010).\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 7 of 48 PageID #:1101\nAs the Democrats were drawing the Adopted Plan behind closed doors, the Democratic-\ncontrolledredistrictingcommitteesintheStateSenateand StateHouseof Representatives misled\nthe public in a cruel charade. The committees held a series of hearings at locations around the\nState, ostensibly to receive public input. Indeed, the Chairman of the State Senate Redistricting\nCommittee represented that it was his “intention ... as soon as there’s a rendering of a map, to\npost that up so people can see that and so we can have hearings afterwards and so people can be\ninformed.” Ex. A40 at 165. But instead of the promised openness, the committee leadership\ntightly controlled the conduct of the hearings, never supplying any drafts of a congressional map\ndespite pleas from the public to do so and even forbidding the public from questioning\ncommitteemembers. SeeEx.A41at69,73,77.\nThe State redistricting committees finally released the proposed map at 4:00 a.m. on the\nFriday of Memorial Day weekend, May 27, 2011. See Ex. A47. Rather than “have hearings\nafterwards” as promised, the State redistricting committees passed the map with extraordinary\nswiftness on straight party-line votes. The Adopted Plan cleared both houses of the Illinois\nlegislature by the following Tuesday, May 31, 2011, just as the Memorial Day weekend came to\naclose.SeeExs.A44,A46-A47.\nThe Adopted Plan skillfully accomplishes the drafters’ goals. Chicago-area Latinos are\nlargely packed into a single congressional district—Adopted District 4—that is racially\ngerrymandered to capture an excessive supermajority of Latinos. See Ex. A2 at 9-11 (expert\nreport noting excessive 65.9% Latino VAP); Add. 25-26 (map of district). Meanwhile, the\nmapmakers substantially reduced the Latino VAP in neighboring Districts 3 and 5 from where it\ncurrently stands. Ex. A1 at 8, 10 (Latino VAP reduced 4.7 points to 24.6% in District 3 and\nreduced8.5points to16.1%inDistrict5).\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 8 of 48 PageID #:1102\nThe Adopted Plan also reverses the results of the 2010 congressional elections byturning\nIllinois from a state in which 11 Republicans and 8 Democrats were elected to Congress a year\nago into a state in which 6 Republicans and 12 Democrats would be elected to Congress in the\nnext election (Illinois having lost one seat in national reapportionment). See Ex. A48; Ex. B at\n¶25. It does so by dismantling traditional areas of Republican influence, carefully connecting\ndisparate enclaves of Democratic strength, and separating Republican incumbents from their\nconstituents.SeeAdd.37-38,41-48,51-56;Ex.Bat¶36.\nPlaintiffs filed a Complaint against the State election authorities who, under Illinois law,\nare charged with enforcing the Adopted Plan. See 10 ILCS 5/1A-8. The Amended Complaint\nalleges thattheAdopted Plan is aproduct ofintentional vote dilutionof Latino voters in Districts\n3, 4, and 5, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (Count I), the Fourteenth\nAmendment (Count II), and the Fifteenth Amendment (Count III); that District 4 is an obvious\nracial gerrymander that is not narrowly tailored to accomplish a compelling state interest, in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count IV); and that the redistricting plan is a blatant\npartisan gerrymander against Republican voters, in violation of the First Amendment (Count V)\nandthe FourteenthAmendment(CountVI).2\nDuring expedited discovery, the non-parties who developed the Adopted Plan largely\nstonewalled Plaintiffs’ attempts to discover relevant evidence. The DCCC refused to provide\nevidence of its central role in the mapmaking process, and the D.C. federal district court has yet\nto decide Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the DCCC’s production. The Illinois state legislature and\n2 On November 1, 2011, this Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander claims and\nallowed Plaintiffs the opportunity to re-plead those claims. Doc. 98 at 22. Plaintiffs filed their\nAmendedComplainton November4,2011.\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 9 of 48 PageID #:1103\ntheir agents also withheld a great deal of relevant evidence on privilege grounds. See Doc. 77 at\n21.\nNotwithstanding the discovery barriers that Plaintiffs have faced, the record evidence\nproves that the Adopted Plan violates the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. This Court’s\nintervention is absolutely necessary “to vindicate” the “important” “public rights” at stake in this\ncase. Doc.77 at13. Forthereasons set forth below, thisCourt shouldgrant Plaintiffs’motion for\napermanentinjunction.\nARGUMENT\nTo obtain a permanent injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) that it will suffer\nirreparable injury; (2) that its remedies at law are inadequate; (3) that a remedy in equity is\nwarranted in light of the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant; and (4) that\nthe public interest would not be disserved by an injunction. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed\nFarms, 130 S. Ct. 2743, 2756 (2010). In voting rights cases, injunctive relief turns largelyon the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s claims, as the right to vote is “fundamental” and “preservative of other\nbasic civil and political rights.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 561-62 (1964). Accordingly,\n“once a State’s legislative apportionment scheme has been found to be unconstitutional, it would\nbe the unusual case in which a court would be justified in not taking appropriate action to insure\nthat no further elections are conducted under the invalid plan.” Id. at 585. Indeed, this Court has\na historyof enjoining Illinois’s unconstitutional congressional redistricting plans. E.g., Hastert v.\nState Bd. of Elections, 777 F. Supp. 634 (N.D. Ill. 1991); In re Cong. Dist. Reapportionment\nCases, No. 81 C 3915, slip op. (N.D. Ill. Nov. 23, 1981), aff'd sub nom. Ryan v.

The Court Should Permanently Enjoin Defendants From Implementing And\nEnforcingTheAdoptedPlan.\nThis Court should permanentlyenjoin theAdopted Plan becauseitunlawfullyimpairs the\nfundamental right to vote in three ways. First, Adopted District 4 is an unconstitutional racial\ngerrymander that is notnarrowlytailored to achieveacompellingstateinterest.Second,Adopted\nDistricts 3, 4, and 5 are the product of an intentional effort to dilute the votes of Latinos in the\narea by packing Latinos into District 4 and removing them from neighboring Districts 3 and 5.\nThird, the Adopted Plan is a gross partisan gerrymander by the Democratic-controlled Illinois\ngovernment that tramples Republican voters’ constitutional rights. For all of these reasons, a\npermanentinjunctionshouldissue.\nA. District4 OfTheAdoptedPlanIsAnUnconstitutionalRacialGerrymander.\nThe Adopted Plan must be enjoined because its District 4 is a racial gerrymander that\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. To prove such a claim, “[t]he plaintiff’s burden is to show,\neither through circumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and demographics or more direct\nevidence going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating the\nlegislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). This standard can be satisfied even if\n“[t]raditional districting criteria were not entirely neglected.” Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 963\n(1996) (plurality opinion). The question simply is whether “traditional districting criteria [were]\nsubordinated to race.” Id. at 962. “Alternatively stated, the question is whether racial\nconsiderations substantially explain the configuration of the district’s borders; if the answer is\nyes, racial considerations will have predominated.” King v. State Bd. of Elections, 979 F. Supp.\n582, 608 (N.D.Ill. 1996) (“King I”),vacated and remanded, 519 U.S. 978 (1996), reaff’d, 979 F.\nSupp.619,620(N.D.Ill.1997)(“KingII”),aff’d,522U.S.1087(1998).\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 11 of 48 PageID #:1105\nOnce the plaintiff establishes that race predominated, it is the defendant’s burden to\njustifythe map under “strict scrutiny, [the] most rigorous and exacting standard of constitutional\nreview.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 920. “To satisfy strict scrutiny, the State must demonstrate that its\ndistrictinglegislation is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest.” Id. Compliance with\nthe Voting Rights Act (“VRA”) is the only compelling interest that courts have recognized in\ncases involving racial gerrymanders. King II, 979 F. Supp. at 622. And a defendant invoking\nVRA Section 2 as the justification for a racial gerrymander must clear two hurdles. First, the\ndefendant must show “a ‘strong basis in evidence’ for concluding that creation of a majority-\nminority district is reasonably necessary to comply with §2.” Bush, 517 U.S. at 977 (plurality\nopinion). Second, the defendant must establish that the challenged district “‘substantially\naddresses the §2 violation.’” Id. Stated differently, “[n]arrow tailoring demands an explanation\nthat the district chosen entails the least race-conscious measure needed to remedy a violation.”\nPrejeanv.Foster,227 F.3d504,518(5thCir.2000).\nUnder these standards, Adopted District 4 is unconstitutional. Race predominantly\nmotivated the district’s shape, and Defendants cannot prove that the district is narrowly tailored\ntocomplywithSection2 oftheVRA.\n1. Race Was The Predominant Factor Motivating Adopted District 4’s\nShape.\nRace was the predominant factor motivating the shape of Adopted District 4. This\nconclusionisinescapable giventhedistrict’s history, demographics,andbizarreshape.\nHistory. Afterthe1990 Census,theIllinois legislaturefailed toadopt aredistrictingplan,\nprompting several lawsuits that were consolidated before this Court. See Hastert, 777 F. Supp.\n634. Republican challengers sought the creation of a Latino-majority district (see Ex. A69 at 6),\nas did the Latino plaintiffs (Hastert, 777 F. Supp. at 638). The Democratic challengers did not\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 12 of 48 PageID #:1106\ninitially seek such a district (see Ex. A70), but they were later forced to agree with the other\nparties that Section 2 required a Latino-majority district to prevent vote dilution. Hastert, 777 F.\nSupp. at 648. The parties settled on a district with a 59.2% Latino voting age population that,\naccording to the court, had an “extraordinary appearance” that “looks not unlike a Rorschach\nblotturnedonitsside.”Id.at648nn.22&24.As the courtexplained:\nWe would be remiss if we failed to observe that the proposed Hispanic district\nagreed to by all parties in the present action makes the “bizarre” configuration of\nthe Karcher [v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725 (1983),] congressional districts acceptable\nby comparison. The Chicago Hispanic community resides principally in two\ndense enclaves, one on Chicago’s near northwest side and one on the near\nsouthwest side. ... Both the Hastert and Rosebrook plans connect the northwest\nand southwest side Hispanic enclaves by running a narrow corridor around the\nwesternendofthe7thCongressionalDistrict,creatingaC-shapedconfiguration.\nId. at 648 n.24. In light of “[t]he extraordinary configuration of the proposed Hispanic district”\n(id. at 648), the Hastert court independently assessed whether Section 2 required a majority-\nLatino district to prevent racial vote dilution. Concluding that such a district was necessary, the\nHastertcourtapprovedthe“creationofanHispanicmajoritydistrict.”Id. at650-51.\nTwo years later, the Supreme Court recognized a Fourteenth Amendment claim based on\nthe “deliberate segregation of voters into separate districts on the basis of race.” Shaw v. Reno,\n509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (“Shaw I”); see Miller, 515 U.S. 900. A voter from the Hastert-\nadopted majority-Latino district soon challenged that district under Shaw. See King I, 979 F.\nSupp.582.\nExtensively examining the Hastert-adopted district, the King I court agreed with the\nplaintiff that “the only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the shape and\ndemographics of the district is that racial considerations predominated over all other factors in\nthe configuration of the Fourth Congressional District.” Id. at 607 (emphasis added). “[T]he only\nfactor that consistently explains the precise configuration of the district’s boundaries is race.” Id.\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 13 of 48 PageID #:1107\nAs King I noted, “the lines of the Fourth Congressional District follow the concentrations of the\nHispanic population with ‘exquisite’ detail.” Id. at 609. The district “‘includes virtually all areas\nof high percent Hispanic concentration on the northern ... part of the City of Chicago as well as\nvirtually all of the areas of high Hispanic concentration on the southern part of the City of\nChicago.’” Id. The court also found that the district was “not visually compact” and that the\ndistrict’s slim western connector made the district contiguous in a “‘hypertechnical” and\n“cynical”senseonly. Id.at608n.48,609n.49.\nThe King I court nevertheless upheld the Hastert-adopted district as narrowly tailored to\nachieve a compelling state interest. It concluded that VRA Section 2 required a majority-Latino\ndistrict to prevent vote dilution, and the Hastert-adopted district was reasonably necessary to\nsatisfy that requirement. Id. at 610-17. At the time, neither enclave of Latinos in the district was\nalone adequate to constitute an effective majority-Latino district. See id. at 617 (“the district’s\nextraordinaryconfigurationwasrequired”).\nThe Supreme Court vacated and remanded King I for “further consideration in light of\nShaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899 (1996) [(“Shaw II”)] and Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952 (1996).” 519\nU.S. 978. But the district court on remand found “both cases supportive of its analysis and\naccordingly affirm[ed] its previous decision.” King II, 979 F. Supp. at 620. The Supreme Court\nsummarily affirmed, over the objections of Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas. 522 U.S.\n1087.\nThe redistricting that followed the 2000 Census maintained District 4 as a racial\ngerrymander. The Senate sponsor of the redistricting plan explained that the legislation\n“complies with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act” and “the Hispanic majority district\nhas been preserved and reconfigured to meet the new population requirements.” Ex. A36 at 10.\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 14 of 48 PageID #:1108\nHecontinued:“[t]heexistingminority/majoritydistricts arealreadyirregularlyshapedtoday,and\nthese districts have been reconfigured to maintain as much of the present districts as possible,\nwhile bringing the districts’ population to the ideal. Doing so requires irregularly shaped\ndistricts.” Id. at 11. The House sponsor likewise stated that the redistricting plan was “intended\nto comply with Section II of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ... with respect to fairness to the\nvoting rights of racial and language minorities. In accordance therewith, ... the one existing\nHispanicDistrictha[s]beenpreservedand reconfigured toachievepopulationequality.”Ex.A37\nat131.\nThemostrecentredistrictingfollowingthe 2010 Censuspreservedtheracial gerrymander\nyet again. When questioned about Adopted District 4, the House sponsor defended the\ngerrymander by observing that “an earlier [district] that did not look dissimilar had been upheld\nby the federal courts,” (Ex. A43 at 15), clearly referencing King I and II. The sponsor in the\nIllinois Senate likewise explained that District 4 was “preserved to be substantiallysimilar to the\n4th Congressional District as the 4th Congressional District was presented ten years ago.” Ex.\nA45 at 12. He added that the Adopted Plan was “intended to comply with the Federal Voting\nRights Act” and that “[i]n accordance therewith, the legislation retains effective African\nAmerican and Hispanic majority/minority districts while also achieving population equality, the\npreservation of the core of existing district boundaries, and incumbent constituent relationships,\nandthemaintenanceofthepartiesincompositionofthesedistricts.” Id. at10.\nFrom this history, the conclusion is unavoidable that race was the “predominant factor\nmotivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without”\nAdoptedDistrict4. Miller,515U.S.at916.\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 15 of 48 PageID #:1109\nDemographics. Demographic evidence confirms that race predominated in the shaping\nof Adopted District 4. The district “encompasses the most heavily Latino portions of both\n[Chicago’s] northside and the southside [Latino] enclaves.” Ex. A1 at 7 (Morrison Rep.); see\nAdd. 25-26 (map of district). In fact, the Latino share of voting age population (“VAP”) in\nAdopted District 4 has increased since Hastert to 65.92%. Ex. A5 at 4 (Morrison Rep.). And that\nincrease is not accidental. In the 65.8% of the Hastert-adopted district that remains in District 4,\nthe Latino VAP is 73.5%, while the portion of the Hastert district removed from District 4 has a\nLatinoVAPofonly37.9%. Id.at3.\nTerritorial swaps in the latest redistricting further evidence the predominance of race in\nshaping Adopted District 4. Because Illinois lost a congressional seat as a result of the 2010\nCensus, the State had to increase District 4’s population by 111,657. See Ex. A5 at 4 (Morrison\nRep.). To do so, the State could have simply added territory to District 4. It instead decided to\n“trade lower Latino VAP territory for higher Latino VAP territory.” Id. The area removed from\nDistrict 4 has a Latino VAP of 40.6%. Id. at 3. The area added has a Latino VAP of 47.2%. Id.\n“Had these territorial trades been more ethnically neutral rather than so ethnically unbalanced,”\nLatinoVAPinAdopted District4wouldbelower.Id.\nShape. Adopted District 4’s bizarreshape further indicates thatrace was the predominant\nfactor behind the creation of the district. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 916 (referencing “circumstantial\nevidence of a district’s shape”); King I, 979 F. Supp. at 606 (considering “uncouth\nconfiguration” of District 4). Adopted District 4 “retains the ‘earmuff’ feature of this district that\nhas been in place” since the Hastert-adopted district (Ex. A2 at 9 (Engstrom Rep.); see Add. 15-\n16(map ofdistrict)),whichKingIandKingIIbothheldwasaracial gerrymander.\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 16 of 48 PageID #:1110\nThis bizarre shape cannot be explained by the “traditional race-neutral districting\nprinciples” of contiguity and compactness. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. Just like the district adopted\nin Hastert, Adopted District 4 is contiguous in a “hypertechnical[] and ... cynical[]” sense only.\nSee King I, 979 F. Supp. at 608 n.49. The “headband” connecting the district’s two “muffs” is\nincredibly narrow. At one point, District 4’s western edge runs along I-294’s southbound lanes\nwhileits eastern edgetravels along I-294’s northbound lanes, leavingthe median as the onlypart\nthat falls within the district. See Add. 17-20. Slightly to the south of that point, the headband\nbecomesnothingmorethanunpopulated grass fieldsandacemetery. Seeid.\nNor is Adopted District 4 compact. The district flunks the “eyeball test” for compactness.\nEx. A2 at 10 (Engstrom Rep.); see King I, 979 F. Supp. at 608 n.48 (finding predecessor district\n“not visually compact”). In addition, the district has a “very low .05” score under the Polsby-\nPopper measure of compactness, which examines “how much districts wander geographically”\n(Ex. A2 at 10-11 (Engstrom Rep.)) and is the “most appropriate compactness measure” for that\ndistrict (Ex. A12 at 218 (Engstrom Dep.)). In fact, District 4 has the lowest Polsby-Popper\nmeasure of any district in the Adopted Plan. Ex. B at ¶ 21; Ex. A2 at 11 (Engstrom Rep.). As\nPlaintiffs’ expert Dr. Richard Engstrom concludes, “[t]he most apparent reason for the bizarre\nshape of CD 4 in the [Adopted] Plan is a desire to create a district with an extremely high\nconcentrationofLatinovoters.”Ex.A2at11.\nDefendants’ Responses. Defendants’ expert, Dr. Allan Lichtman, has proffered a series\nof rationalizations for the shape of Adopted District 4, but none of his arguments rebuts the\nobvious fact that race was the predominant motivating factor in shaping the district. First, Dr.\nLichtman claims that Illinois did not “maximize” District 4’s Latino population and could have\nsqueezed an additional 2.5% of Latino VAP into the district. Ex. A3 at 13, 16. But even if Dr.\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 17 of 48 PageID #:1111\nLichtman’s “maximized” district were possible,3 whether a district maximizes Latino VAP is not\nthe right question. A racial gerrymander exists if race was “the predominant factor motivating\nthe legislature’s [redistricting] decision” (Miller, 515 U.S. at 916), not the sole factor. Thus, in\nBush v. Vera the Supreme Court found a district unconstitutional even though the State\nredistricted with “mixed motive[s].” 517 U.S. at 959. Here too, even if Adopted District 4 could\nhave been more racially gerrymandered, it is racially gerrymandered nonetheless; race\n“substantiallyexplain[s]theconfigurationof [its]borders.”KingI,979 F.Supp.at608.\nSecond, Dr. Lichtman contends that Adopted District 4 “preserves the core” of prior\nversions of District 4. Ex. A3 at 32. But given District 4’s history, that argument simply\nacknowledges that the district remains constitutionally suspect. “[P]reserving the cores of prior\ndistricts” can be “legitimate” if that core is “nondiscriminatory.” Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S.\n725, 740 (1983). But District 4’s core is discriminatory. See King I, 979 F. Supp. at 607. That\ngerrymandered core cannot be grandfathered in simply because it has existed for 20 years. See\nDaggett v. Kimmelman, 580 F. Supp. 1259, 1262 (D.N.J. 1984) (“While Exhibit IF–2(c)\npreserves the cores of the districts established in the Feldman Plan, those districts are\nunconstitutional.”), aff’d sub. nom. Karcher v. Daggett, 467 U.S. 1222 (1984). Moreover, the\nAdopted Plan did not simply preserve District 4’s core; it increased the racial gerrymander by\nmovingresidentsoutof District4inorderto “tradelower Latino VAPterritoryforhigher Latino\nVAPterritory.”Ex.A5at4(MorrisonRep.).\nThird, Dr. Lichtman argues that Latino ethnicity is strongly correlated with partisan\naffiliation. Ex. A3 at 32. But that fact is irrelevant here because District 4 and its neighboring\n3 Plaintiffs’ expert demographer, Dr. Peter Morrison, has concluded that Dr. Lichtman’s\nhypothesizeddistrict“rest[s]onaseries ofundocumentedassumptions”anddoesnot“maintain[]\nthenecessaryequaltotalpopulationinCD4andallofthesurroundingdistricts.”Ex.A5at6.\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 18 of 48 PageID #:1112\nareas are “overwhelmingly Democratic.” Ex. A6 at 10 (Engstrom Rep.). To keep District 4\nDemocratic, it matters very little where the lines are drawn. Yet those lines are drawn to\nsegregate the area’s Latinos, who vote mostly for Democrats, from non-Latinos, who also vote\nmostlyforDemocrats.\nFinally, Dr. Lichtman suggests in passing that the shape of District 4 protects its\nincumbent Luis Gutierrez. Ex. A3 at 32. But selectively protecting certain incumbents “does not\nqualifyas a legitimate state policy.” Larios v. Cox, 300 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1347 (N.D. Ga. 2004),\naff’d, 542 U.S. 947 (2004). Plus, Defendants have presented no evidence that Rep. Gutierrez\nwould lose in a non-racially gerrymandered district—including either district proposed by\nPlaintiffs (Fair District 3 or 4), which each contain large portions of Adopted District 4 and have\nrelatively high Latino VAPs (46.5% and 59.4%, respectively)—especially when he has always\nwon by enormous margins on the occasions that anyone has bothered to challenge him. See Ex.\nA1 at 16 (Morrison Rep.); Ex. B at ¶ 37. Indeed, Defendants cannot plausibly claim that Rep.\nGutierrez requires a district with a Latino VAP of 65.92% when it is Defendants’ position that\nracialblocvotingdoesnotexistinthefirstplace. SeeEx.A4at3(LichtmanRep.).\n2. Defendants Cannot Show, Under Strict Scrutiny, That The Adopted\nPlanIsNarrowlyTailoredToAchieveACompelling StateInterest.\nBecause race predominated in shaping Adopted District 4, Defendants must prove that\nthe district is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. Defendants cannot do so.\nDefendantshavenotpresentedastrongevidentiarybasis thatVRA Section2requires amajority-\nLatino district, and, even if they had, Adopted District 4 is not the least race-conscious measure\nneededtocomplywithSection2.\nNo Strong Basis InEvidence. The reports oftheir own expert precludeDefendants from\nestablishing the required “‘strong basis in evidence’ for concluding that creation of a majority-\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 19 of 48 PageID #:1113\nminority district is reasonably necessary to comply with §2.” Bush, 517 U.S. at 977. On behalf\nofDefendants, Dr. Lichtman asserts thatracialblocvotingdoes not exist:“In CookCountythere\nis an overwhelming pattern of voting that is not polarized between Latinos and non-Latinos and\nan overwhelming pattern of victory, not defeat, for Latino candidates of choice.” Ex. A4 at 3. In\nthe absence of racially polarized voting, Section 2 does not require any majority-Latino district.\nSee Bush, 517 U.S. at 978. As a result, based on Defendants’ position regarding racial bloc\nvoting, compliance with Section 2 cannot justify making race the predominant factor in the\ncreationof AdoptedDistrict4.4\nNot Least Race-Conscious Measure. To the extent that Defendants can prove that\nSection 2 requires a majority-Latino district, Defendants cannot establish that Adopted District 4\nis the “least race-consciousmeasureneeded”to complywith Section2. Prejean,227 F.3d at518.\nThough King I and King II concluded that the Hastert-adopted predecessor district was\nreasonably necessary in the 1990s, conditions have changed substantially. These last twenty\nyears haveseen “substantial Latino population growth.”Ex. A1 at 2(Morrison Rep.). The Latino\nshare of Cook County’s population has surged from 13.6% in 1990 to 24.0% in 2010. Id. These\nchangedconditions requireareassessmentofKingI’sandKingII’s conclusions.\nAsPlaintiffs’expertDr. Engstrom—whotestified infavorofcreatingthemajority-Latino\ndistrict adopted in Hastert—has explained, “a district with such a bizarre shape is no longer\nnecessary to provide Latino voters with an opportunity to elect representatives of their choice\nsimilar to that provided by the initial earmuff-shaped district.” Ex. A6 at 9. Indeed, the State\n4 As Plaintiffs explain below (at pp. 21-22), Dr. Lichtman’s conclusion on racial bloc voting is\nincorrect. Still, because Defendants bear the burden of proving racial bloc voting on Plaintiffs’\nracialgerrymanderclaim,Dr. Lichtman’stestimonycompelsafindingofunconstitutionality.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 20 of 48 PageID #:1114\neasily could have drawn a district that complies with Section 2 without racial gerrymandering.\nSeeEx.A2at11-12(EngstromRep.).\nPlaintiffs have proposed just such a district—Fair District 4. That district has a 59.4%\nLatino VAP (Ex. A1 at 13 (Morrison Rep.)), which exceeds the 59.2% Latino VAP that Hastert,\nKingI,andKingIIallfoundtobesufficientunderSection2.And,crucially, Fair District4isnot\nracially gerrymandered. Joiningthe southern part of the “earmuff” with trulycontiguous areas in\nthe near southwest Chicago area, Fair District 4 is “considerably more compact” than Adopted\nDistrict 4. Ex. A6 at 21 (Engstrom Rep.); Add. 15-16 (Adopted District 4); Add. 65-66 (Fair\nDistrict 4). This is visually apparent and confirmed by Fair District 4’s Polsby-Popper measure\nof.34,asix-foldimprovementoverthefigurefor AdoptedDistrict4. SeeEx.Bat¶21.\nIn short, race predominated in the shaping of Adopted District 4, and Defendants cannot\nprove that the district is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. The Adopted\nPlanthus violates theConstitutionandmustbeenjoined.\nB. The Adopted Plan Intentionally Discriminates Against Latino Voters In\nDistricts 3,4,And5.\nThe Adopted Plan must be enjoined for a second reason: it is the product of intentional\ndiscrimination against Latino voters. The State purposely diluted the voting power of Latinos by\npacking Latinos into Adopted District 4 while removing them from neighboring Adopted\nDistricts 3 and 5. Such intentional discrimination violates Section 2 ofthe VotingRights Act,the\nFourteenth Amendment, and the Fifteenth Amendment. See Doc. 98 at 3, 13; see also Garza v.\nCnty. of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 1990) (Section 2); Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S.\n613,617(1982)(FourteenthAmendment); Hastert,777 F. Supp.at645 (FifteenthAmendment).\nA State “engage[s] in deliberate racial discrimination” when it “deliberately adopt[s]\ndevices for limiting [minority] representation,” regardless of “the dominant desire actuating the\n16\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 21 of 48 PageID #:1115\nredistricting plan.” Barnett v. Daley, 32 F.3d 1196, 1199 (7th Cir. 1994). Thus, “[i]t is not ...\nnecessary for a plaintiff to demonstrate that discriminatory purpose is the only underlying\nmotivation for the challenged redistricting plan.” Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1406 (7th\nCir. 1984). “[A]s long as [discriminatory purpose] is one of the motives,” the State has acted\nunlawfully. Id.; accord United States v. Brown, 561 F.3d 420, 433 (5th Cir. 2009). Further,\nwhere intentional discrimination exists, a plaintiff’s “showing of injury . . . need not be as\nrigorous” as in other vote dilution cases. Garza, 918 F.2d at 771; see also Doc. 98 at 8 (“the first\nGinglesfactoris appropriatelyrelaxedwhenintentionaldiscriminationisshown”).\n“Determiningwhetherinvidious discriminatorypurposewas amotivating factor demands\na sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available”\n(Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Auth. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977)), though\n“discriminatory intent need not be proved by direct evidence” (Rogers, 458 U.S. at 618). Courts\nconsider a number of circumstantial factors in assessing whether intentional discrimination\nexists.AsthisCourtrecognizedinitsdiscoveryorder,the “factors include, butarenotlimited to,\nbloc voting along racial lines; low minority voter registration; exclusion from the political\nprocess; unresponsiveness of elected officials to needs of minorities; and depressed socio-\neconomic status attributable to inferior education and employment and housing discrimination.”\nDoc. 77 at 7. “Other factors include the historical background of the decision; the specific\nsequence of events leading up to the challenged decision; departures from the normal procedural\nsequence; minority retrogression ...; and manipulation of district boundaries to adjust the\nrelative size of minority groups, including the ‘packing’ of minority voters.” Id. at 7-8. Yet\n“[a]nother relevant consideration is whether the number of districts in which the minority group\n17\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 22 of 48 PageID #:1116\nforms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in the relevant\narea.”LeagueofUnited LatinAm.Citizensv.Perry,548U.S.399,426 (2006)(“LULAC”).\nWhen examining the totality of the relevant evidence, it is clear that the State purposely\ndiluted Latino votes in Adopted Districts 3, 4, and 5 to cabin Latinos’ growing political\ninfluence.\nManipulated District Boundaries. The district boundaries established by Adopted\nDistricts 3, 4, and 5 provide compelling evidence of intentional vote dilution. See Ketchum, 740\nF.2d at 1407 (“discrimination may be identified in the manipulation of ... boundaries to adjust\nthe relative size of racial groups”). In two ways, the Adopted Plan purposely alters district\nboundaries so as to prevent Latinos from electing their candidate of choice in any district other\nthanDistrict4.\nFirst, the Adopted Plan packs a supermajority of Latinos into District 4 so that the votes\nof Latinos inside the district are “wasted” and cannot be combined with the votes of Latinos\noutside the district. See id. at 1408 n.7 (“packing” involves the “excessive concentration of\n[minority] population” and “may be viewed as ‘wasting’ minority voting power and\nunnecessarily minimizing minority effectiveness in other districts”). The Latino share of VAP in\nAdopted District 4 stands at 65.9% as a result of ethnically unbalanced territorial trades in the\n2011 redistricting process that added territory with a 47.2% Latino VAP, while removing\nterritory with a 40.6% Latino VAP. Ex. A1 at 8 (Morrison Rep.). That Latino VAP is “higher\nthan necessary to provide Latinos with a viable opportunity to elect representatives of their\nchoice.” Ex. A2 at 9 (Dr. Engstrom: “In other words, the district is packed in a waythat ‘wastes’\nLatino votes.”). Indeed, after Hastert gavethepredecessor district a Latino VAPof59.2%, “both\nof the candidates that contested the Democratic primary in [District 4] were Latinos,” and the\n18\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 23 of 48 PageID #:1117\nwinner(Luis Gutierrez)handilywon the general election, and everyprimaryand generalelection\nsince,bylargemargins. Id.;seealsoEx.B at¶37.5\nSecond, the Adopted Plan simultaneously “cracks” Latinos in bordering Districts 3 and 5\nby reducing their share of VAP. Adopted District 3 lies directly south of Adopted District 4’s\nsouthern muff. For the past two decades, District 3 has been represented by white congressmen\nBill Lipinski (1993-2005) and his son Dan Lipinski (2005-present). The explosive growth of\nChicago’s southwest Latino community threatens their hold on power, and that threat increases\nbythe day. See Ex. A1 at 6 (Morrison Rep.).6 To counteract this threat, District 3 in the Adopted\nPlan expands significantly to the south and west, picking up considerable territory with low\nLatino population. See Add. 11-12. The area added to District 3 has a Latino VAP of 16.4%,\nwhilethearearemoved from District 3 has aLatino VAPof34.4%. Ex.A1 at 8 (Morrison Rep.).\nThese ethnically unbalanced territorial trades reduce District 3’s Latino VAP from 29.3% to\n5 In its November 1, 2011 opinion, this Court suggested that “‘Latinos must be 65 to 70 percent\nof the total population in order to be confident of electing a Latino.’” Doc. 98 at 8 (quoting\nBarnett v. City of Chicago, 141 F.3d 699, 703 (7th Cir. 1998)). But that is simply a “rule of\nthumb” (Barnett, 141 F.3d at 702) to be used “[i]n the absence of more reliable data” and\n“‘should be reconsidered regularly to reflect new information and new statistical data.’”\nCampuzano v. Ill.State Bd. ofElections, 200 F. Supp. 2d 905, 910-11 (N.D. Ill. 2002).Here, just\nas in Campuzano, expert evidence of voting strength should supplant those rules of thumb. See\nid. at 911-12 (crediting testimony of Dr. Lichtman “that current voting rights scholarship\ngenerallyopposes uniformapplication oftherule of thumb to majority-minoritydistricts because\nfactors such as age, registration rates, and turnout behavior of voters can vary significantly from\ndistrict to district”). In any event, Latinos represent 71.1% of Adopted District 4’s total\npopulation, exceeding the rule of thumb. Ex. A1 at 16 (Morrison Rep.). Latinos would constitute\n65.0%of FairDistrict4’stotalpopulation,fallingwithintheCourt’sruleofthumb. Id.\n6 Plaintiffs’ expert demographer, Dr. Peter Morrison, has determined that Latino VAP in\nChicago’s southwest Latino community will increase by 1.1 percentage points every year. Ex.\nA1 at6 (Morrison Rep.). Latino VAPin Chicago’s northwest Latino communitywillincreaseby\nonepercentagepointevery3.2 years. Id.\n19\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 24 of 48 PageID #:1118\n24.6%. Id. Such a low share of VAP does not offer Latinos any chance to influence, much less\ncontrol,thechoiceoftheirrepresentative. SeeEx.A6at21-23(EngstromRep.).7\nDistrict 5 tells a similar story. For the last 15 years, District 5 has been represented by\nwhite Democrats (currently, Mike Quigley). The 2002-2010 version of District 5 lies directly\nnorth of District 4’s northern “muff” and has been affected by the Latino community’s strong\ngrowth. See Ex. A1 at 4-5 (Morrison Rep.). Under the Adopted Plan, District 5 retreats from this\nhighly Latino-populated area and grabs largely white-populated territory to the west, east, and\nnorth.SeeAdd.31-32.Theterritoryremoved fromDistrict5hasa Latino VAPof54.5%.Ex.A1\nat 10 (Morrison Rep.). The area added to District 5 has a Latino VAP of 12.8%. Id. As a result,\nLatino VAP plummets from 24.6% to 16.1%. Id. Again, such a low share of VAP offers Latinos\nnoroleinselectingtheirrepresentative.SeeEx.A6at21-23(EngstromRep.).\nTheallocationof Latino votersamongtheAdoptedDistrictsinand around Chicago isnot\nmere coincidence. Latinos increasingly threaten the white congressmen of Districts 3 and 5—\nespeciallyin the crucial Democratic primary—and the Adopted Plan intentionallystems that tide\nbypackingDistrict4and crackingDistricts3 and 5.\nProportionality. Illinois’s Latino population doubled over the last twenty years, rising\nfrom 7.9% in 1990 to 15.8% in 2010, with voting age population likewise jumping from 6.8% in\n1990 to 13.4% in 2010. Ex. A1 at 2, 15 (Morrison Rep.). Latinos thus would control 2.4 districts\nif Illinois’s 18 congressional seats were distributed proportionally based on VAP. Yet, Latinos\nform an effective majorityin onlyonedistrictin the Adopted Plan—District 4. See Ex. A6 at 21-\n22(EngstromRep.).\n7 Indeed, Defendants’ expert Dr. Lichtman testified before the General Assembly’s redistricting\ncommitteesthatinidentifyingstatelegislativedistrictsthatoffered aminoritygroup areasonable\nopportunity for electoral success, he did “not go into the 20 percent range” in terms of the\nminoritygroup’sshareofVAP,butinsteadstoppedat35%. Ex.A42at77-78.\n20\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 25 of 48 PageID #:1119\nWhile this Court concluded in its November 1, 2011 opinion that citizen voting age\npopulation (“CVAP”) is “the more appropriate inquiry for the proportionalityfactor” (Doc. 98 at\n9), Plaintiffs respectfully disagree. This Court relied on Barnett v. City of Chicago, 141 F.3d 699\n(7th Cir. 1998), and LULAC, which both used citizenship figures reported in the 2000 Census.\nYet, as this Court acknowledged, “the 2010 census doesn’t include citizenship.” Doc. 98 at 9.\nTheCourtsuggested that “citizen voting-age population can beshown through expert testimony”\n(id. at 9-10), but that approach conflicts with Seventh Circuit holding that “estimates about\npopulation ... don’t matter, because apportionment is based on Census returns.” Gonzalez v.\nCity of Aurora, Ill., 535 F.3d 594, 597 (7th Cir. 2008). Plus, estimates of CVAP based on the\nAmerican Communities Survey (“ACS”) suffer from “important limitations that render them\ninaccurateandunreliable.”Ex.A5at8(MorrisonRep.).\nEven if CVAP were the proper benchmark, Latinos are still underrepresented by 57% on\nthatmeasure. Defendants’expert Dr. Lichtman admits that Latinos would control1.57 districts if\nIllinois’s congressional seats were distributed proportionally based on the ACS estimate of\nCVAP. Ex. A7 at 20. But again, under the Adopted Plan they control only one district.\nMoreover, as the Court may “consider both census voting-age population data and evidence\ndeducing citizen voting-age population” (Doc. 98 at 10), the fact that Latinos are\nunderrepresented by 140% when using VAP should further tip the scales toward a finding of\ndisproportionality.\nPolarized Voting.Raciallypolarized votingin the Latino areas ofAdopted Districts 3, 4,\nand 5 further evidences discriminatory intent. See Brown, 561 F.3d at 433 n.10 (listing “the\nextent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized”\nas relevant). It also establishes the necessaryinjury. See Doc. 98 at 8 (Plaintiffs must prove “that\n21\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 26 of 48 PageID #:1120\nthe minority group is politically cohesive and that the majority votes as a bloc”). After studying\nrelevant elections in the specific areas in which vote dilution is alleged—Adopted District 4 and\nFairDistricts 3 and 4—Plaintiffs’expertDr. Engstromconcluded that “votingin theareaatissue\nis racially polarized.” Ex. A2 at 14. Dr. Engstrom examined relevant Democratic primaries, as\nwell as other relevant elections, and found that “[t]he preference of Latino voters residing in this\narea for Latino candidates ... is unmistakable, and it is not a preference shared by the other\nvoters in the area.” Id. at 8. Because voting is racially polarized, “[t]he relative presence of\nLatinos in congressional districts in this area therefore will be a major factor in whether Latino\nvoters are able to elect the representatives of their choice from this area to the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives.” Id. As a result, the packing of Latinos in Adopted District 4 and the cracking\nof Latinos in Adopted Districts 3 and 5 diminishes Latinos’ opportunity to elect representatives\nof their choice. Accordingly, as Dr. Engstrom concludes, the Adopted Plan “dilutes the voting\nstrengthof Latinosinthearea.” Id. at14.8\nRedistricting Process. On March 3, 2011, soon after the 2010 Census figures were\nreleased, District 3’s congressman Dan Lipinski drew his own proposed district and emailed it to\nthe Illinois Speaker of the House’s chief of staff. Ex. A20. That proposed District 3 retreated\n8 Defendants’ expert Dr. Lichtman argues that racial bloc voting does not exist. But Dr.\nLichtman’s analysis is deeply flawed. Among other things, Dr. Lichtman relies on a\nmethodology called “ecological regression,” which “is ‘often wildly inaccurate,’” “produces\n‘impossible results ... with regularity,’” and fails to provide “confidence intervals to reflect the\nuncertainty of [its] estimates.” Ex. A6 at 5, 8 (Engstrom Rep.). Dr. Engstrom, by contrast, relies\non a “celebrated” methodology called “ecological inference,” which was developed in response\nto the inadequacies of the ecological regression model. See id. In addition, Dr. Lichtman’s\nanalysis improperly focuses beyond the area of concern by examining “all of Cook County,”\neven though Plaintiffs’ intentional votedilution allegations pertain onlyto Districts 3, 4, and 5 of\nthe Adopted Plan. Id. at 12. As Defendants themselves have argued in this case, “vote dilution is\na district-specific, not statewide”—or even county-wide—“inquiry.” Doc. 40 at 6. Dr.\nLichtman’s flawed methodology and overbroad analysis do not remotely undermine Dr.\nEngstrom’s conclusions. SeealsoDoc.98 at8(requiringdistrict-specificanalysis).\n22\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 27 of 48 PageID #:1121\nfrom current District 3’s northern border with District 4 and expanded significantly to the south\nand west. See Ex. A21. The following month, on April 11, 2011, Rep. Lipinski sent another\nemail to the Speaker’s chief of staff, asking to meet with him and attaching a “work-in-progress\nmap” that likewise expanded District 3 significantly south and west of District 3’s current\nboundaries.Ex.A24.\nOn April 15, 2011, Rep. Lipinski’s deputy chief of staff emailed the Speaker’s chief of\nstaff with a “revis[ed]” “map for Congressman Lipinski’s 3rd District.” Ex. A25. The aide\nexplained that Rep. Lipinski “asked that I send you a copy” and commented that the revised\nDistrict3 “is about57% DPI, 22%hispanic, about4%black.”Id.9 Andon April17,an employee\nworking for the DCCC emailed the chief of staff of Democratic Rep. Jerry Costello—who also\nwas involved with the mapmaking process—with “the proposed Lipinski changes,” which\nincluded “[t]he most relevant stats for the 3rdCD.” Ex. A26. Those “most relevant stats” (id.)\nagain show the district’s “18+ Hisp” figure. Ex. A27. As is clear, Rep. Lipinski’s office and the\nother map drafters closely monitored District 3’s Latino VAP. And for good reason: the higher\nthe Latino VAP in District 3, the more likely it would be that Rep. Lipinski would face a strong\nLatinochallenger, particularlyastheLatinopopulationcontinuedto growinfuture years.\nRep. Lipinski had tremendous reason to fear such a challenge. Rep. Lipinski has an\nespecially “poor voting record on immigration issues,” despite the fact that “[o]ne-fifth of [his]\ndistrict’s residents areimmigrants.”Ex. A68. For example, hevoted for aborderfence and voted\nto punish Chicago for refusing to inquire about immigration status when offering police\nprotection and other vital services. Id. His abysmal voting record lost him the endorsement of\nIllinois’s lone Latino congressman. Id. The fact that “elected officials” like Rep. Lipinski are\n9 “DPI”likelymeans DemocraticPerformance Index, an estimateofwhich partywill prevail in a\ngeneral election.\n23\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 28 of 48 PageID #:1122\n“unresponsive[] ... to needs of minorities” is yet another factor favoring an intentional\ndiscriminationfinding.Doc.77at7.\nWhile Rep. Lipinski’s officeprivatelydrew the boundaries of District 3, theleadership of\nIllinois’s state legislature kept the backroom map-drawing process well-hidden. As we have\nalready detailed, the Democratic leaders of the legislature’s redistricting committees refused to\nanswer questions about the mapmaking process and reneged on promises to hold hearings after\nreleasing their proposed map. See supra p. 3. Instead, over Memorial Day weekend, the map\nwas released and pushed through the General Assembly in quick succession. Id. Those\ndeceptiveproceduralmaneuvers further supportafindingofdiscriminatoryintent. SeeDoc.77 at\n7 (listing “the specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision” and “departures\nfromthenormalproceduralsequence”asindiciaofdiscriminatoryintent).\nHistory Of Discrimination. The Adopted Plan is the latest chapter in a sad history of\ngovernmental discrimination against Chicago’s Latinos. See Doc. 77 at 7 (listing “the historical\nbackground of the decision” as a relevant factor). In Rybicki v. State Board of Elections, 574 F.\nSupp. 1082, 1122-23 (N.D. Ill. 1982), Latinos challenged the Illinois state legislative\nredistricting plan and presented evidence at trial of purposeful vote dilution, including evidence\nthatthecurrentSpeakeroftheIllinoisHouseofRepresentatives(MikeMadigan) wasbehindthat\neffort. See id. at 1123 (alleging that “Representative Madigan” and others “intentionally\nfractured both Hispanic communities by dividing each community among four separate\nlegislative districts”). “[A]t the urging of the court,” the parties reached a settlement agreement\nin which there no longer was “purposeful dilution of the Hispanic vote.” Id. at 1123-24.\nFurthermore, in Ketchum, 740 F.2d 1398, the Seventh Circuit upheld a decision striking down\nthe1982Chicago aldermanicredistrictingplanbecauseitdilutedthevotes of Latinos.\n24\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 29 of 48 PageID #:1123\nThe following decade, the Hastert court concluded “that ethnic bloc voting patterns have\nthwarted the political interests of the Hispanic community.” 777 F. Supp. at 650. The “history of\ndiscrimination, both past and recent, against the Chicago Hispanic community and its attendant\nimpact on effective political participation and representation” convinced the court to adopt the\nmajority-Latino District 4. Id. Then, in King I, the court upheld the constitutionality of that\ndistrict after noting the existence of “a definite pattern and practice of electoral discrimination\nagainsttheHispaniccommunity.”979 F. Supp.at615.\nIn Barnett, 141 F.3d at 702, the Seventh Circuit observed that “[v]oting for aldermen in\nChicagoispolarized”and “Latinos arealmostnever elected inwards that donotcontain aLatino\nmajority of citizens of voting age.” In the redistricting committee hearings that followed the\n2000 Census, Defendants’ own expert Dr. Lichtman testified that “the State of Illinois in my\nview is on special notice to make sure that any redistricting plan does not impede minority voter\nopportunities.” Ex.A38at 65. Dr. Lichtman subsequentlytestified in 2002 litigationchallenging\ntheredistrictingof Illinois’s legislaturethatthethreethresholdrequirementsforaVRASection2\nclaim—including racially polarized voting—were satisfied by Cook County Hispanics. Ex. A13\nat99.\nFinally, courts have also recognized that Cook County Latinos have been subjected to\ndiscriminatory voting practices that prevent them from enjoying an equal opportunity to elect\ncandidates of their choice. In Black v. McGuffage, 209 F. Supp. 2d 889, 897 (N.D. Ill. 2002), for\ninstance, the court refused to dismiss a suit by Latino voters challenging the impact of punch\ncard error in the 2000 election, ruling that “voters residing in predominantly Latino and African\nAmerican precincts where punch card machines are utilized[] bear a greater risk that their votes\nwill not be counted than do other voters” and therefore “Plaintiffs’ participation in the political\n25\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 30 of 48 PageID #:1124\nprocess could be significantly diminished.” Similarly, in United States v. Town of Cicero, No.\n00-C-1530, 2000 WL 34342276, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 15, 2000), the Department of Justice\nobtained a temporary restraining order after the court found it likely that Cicero’s candidate\nresidency requirement was “adopted, at least in part, with the racially discriminatory purpose of\ntargeting potential Hispanic candidates for disqualification and thereby seeking to prevent\nHispanicvoters fromhavingtheopportunitytovoteforand/or electcandidatesoftheirchoice, in\nviolationofSection2oftheVotingRightsAct.”\nTo be sure, recent years have seen a few electoral successes for Latino candidates in the\nChicago area. But those victories are too limited in number and scope to be considered anything\nbut isolated exceptions where Latino candidates were able to prevail in spite of the long and\ncontinuinghistory of electoral discrimination against Latinos in the Chicago area. See Ex. A6 at\n8-14(EngstromRep.).\nSocioeconomic Disparities. Latinos in Illinois also continue to suffer the effects of\ndiscrimination in a wide variety of areas, including employment, education, and housing. See\nDoc. 77 at 7 (listing “depressed socio-economic status attributable to inferior education and\nemployment andhousing discrimination”as relevant).As summarized in the2007 Illinois Latino\nFamily Commission Act, “[d]espite unprecedented population growth, Latinos lag behind in\nmajor indicators of well-being relative to education, health, employment, and child welfare, as\nwell as representation throughout the State [of Illinois].” 20 ILCS 3983/5. “Latino families\nremain outside of the margins of opportunities in the State” and face “tremendous challenges.”\nId.\nIn the areaofemployment,recentcensus datareveals that Latinos in CookCountyhavea\nper capita annual income of only $15,184, which is just over half of the Cook County average.\n26\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 31 of 48 PageID #:1125\nSee Exs. A57, A58; see also Ex. A53 at 8 (“Latinos had lower family incomes than any other\nmajor racial or ethnic group in the Chicago region in both 2000 and 2006.”). Latinos suffer from\nhigher unemployment rates as well: 12.7% of Latinos in Illinois were unemployed in 2010,\ncomparedwithonly9.1%ofwhites. SeeEx.A60.\nLatinos in the Chicago area also face severe disadvantages in education, with a 2005\nstudy reporting that several Chicago-area school districts serving predominantly Latino students\nwere underperforming by a considerable margin and spending less per pupil when compared to\npredominantly white districts. Ex. A61 at 24-25, 31. These and other disadvantages contribute to\nLatino students’ lower rates of high school and college completion. See Exs. A55, A56 (42%\npercent of Cook County Latinos lack high school diplomas, compared to 17% of all Cook\nCounty residents); Ex. A53 (“[o]nly 11 percent of Latinos in the [Chicago] region in 2006 had\ncollege degrees, compared to 18 percent for African-Americans, 41 percent for White residents,\nand61percentfor Asians”).\nLatinos fare no better when it comes to housing. Not only do they have difficulty\naccessing affordable housing (see Ex. A52), but they encounter discrimination when trying to\npurchase homes in Chicago (see Ex. A65 at A6-3). Accordingly, “metro Chicago continues to be\nmarkedbyalargedegreeofresidentialsegregationalongracial/ethniclines.”Ex.A64at5.\nThese disadvantages impede the ability of Latinos to participate effectively in the\npolitical process. As the Hastert court observed, “discrimination against Chicago Hispanics in\nhousing, education and services” is a “cause of the historically low Hispanic voter registration\nand turnout.” 777 F. Supp. at 650. As of 2010, only51.9% of Latino citizens of voting age were\nregistered to vote in Illinois, compared to 66.8% of whites and 66.7% of African Americans. Ex.\nA59. And in the November 2010 elections, only 32.2% of Illinois’s Latino voting-age citizens\n27\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 32 of 48 PageID #:1126\nvoted, compared to 45.0% of whites and 54.8% of African Americans. Id. As this data shows,\n“Latino political power” in Illinois continues to be “overshadowed by other segments of the\nelectorate.”Ex.A62at3.\nIn short, the State purposely diluted the votes of Latinos in Districts 3, 4, and 5 of the\nAdopted Plan in response to the Latino community’s strong and certain growth. The changes in\nDistricts 3, 4, and 5’s demographics provide unmistakable evidence that the Adopted Plan will\ndiminish Latinos’ electoral opportunities over the next ten years, and the totality of relevant\nfactors confirm the presence of intentional vote dilution. The Adopted Plan violates the Voting\nRightsActandtheU.S. Constitutionandmustbeenjoined.\nC. The Adopted Plan Intentionally Creates Unconstitutional Partisan\nGerrymanders.\nThe Adopted Plan suffers from another fatal defect. It uses blatant partisan\ngerrymandering to benefit Democrats at the expense of Republicans. The Adopted Plan thus\nviolates the First and Fourteenth Amendments by intentionally penalizing and discriminating\nagainst Republican voters based on their political affiliations and their expression of political\nviews.TheAdopted Plan shouldthereforebeenjoinedonpartisan gerrymanderinggrounds.\nAlthough some Justices have voiced justiciability objections, the Supreme Court has\nconsistently maintained that partisan gerrymandering claims are indeed justiciable and that some\npartisan gerrymandering violates the Constitution. See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 413-20 (Kennedy,\nJ.); id. at 447-73 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); id. at 483-84 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part); id. at 491-92 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and\ndissentingin part); Vieth v.Jubelirer,541 U.S. 267, 306-17 (2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring); id.\nat 317-39 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id. at 343-55 (Souter, J., dissenting); id. at 355-56, 366-67\n(Breyer, J., dissenting); Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109, 118-34 (1986) (plurality opinion); id.\n28\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 33 of 48 PageID #:1127\nat 161-174 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). As Justice Kennedy explained\ninprovidingthefifthvoteforthatviewin Vieth,541U.S.at312:\nIf a State passed an enactment that declared ‘All future apportionment shall be\ndrawn so as most to burden Party X’s rights to fair and effective representation,\nthough still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles,’ we would surely\nconclude the Constitution had been violated. If that is so, we should admit the\npossibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result\nwithout that express directive. This possibility suggests that in another case a\nstandard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionment’s de\nfacto incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective\nrepresentation (and so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of\napportionment andthusis usedinanimpermissiblefashion).\nThe Court has articulated two legal bases for partisan gerrymander claims. Traditionally,\nthe Court has understood partisan gerrymandering to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment when a State uses political party classifications to create districts that\nimpermissibly dilute the votes of those who support one of the political parties. See Davis, 478\nU.S. at 118-19, 127-33 (plurality opinion) (“unconstitutional discrimination occurs” when the\nelectoral system “will consistently degrade a voter’s or a group of voters’ influence on the\npolitical process”); id. at 171 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (violation\npresent where “district lines were drawn for the purpose and with the effect of substantially\ndebasing the strength of votes cast by Democrats as a group”). More recently, Justice Kennedy\nhas suggested that “[w]here it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of\nimposingburdens on a disfavored partyand its voters, the First Amendment mayoffer a sounder\nand more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.” Vieth, 541\nU.S.at315. Plaintiffshavealleged claims underboththeories.\nThe Supreme Court has yet to agree on the specifics of a standard for judging partisan\ngerrymander claims, whether under the Equal Protection Clause or the First Amendment. See\nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 413-14 (disagreement over substantive standard “persists”). But the Court\n29\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 34 of 48 PageID #:1128\nhas long recognized that such a claim has two basic elements: (1) an intent to discriminate\nagainst or otherwise burden a political group; and (2) an effect that harms the ability of a\npolitical group to elect candidates. See Vieth, 541 U.S. at 315 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n(unconstitutionality turns on whether “gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing\nburdens on a disfavored party and its voters”); Davis, 478 U.S. at 127 (plurality opinion) (“in\norder to succeed” on partisan gerrymander claim, plaintiffs must “prove both intentional\ndiscrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that\ngroup”);id.at161(Powell,J.,concurringinpartanddissentinginpart)(same).\nPlaintiffs remain convinced that courts bear the burden of fleshing out the precise proof\nrequired to prevail on a partisan gerrymander claim and that articulating a precise standard is\nunnecessary because the abundant evidence here would meet any reasonable standard this Court\nmight adopt. See Doc. 83 at 7-9. But Plaintiffs recognize that this Court has taken the view that\nPlaintiffs must comeforward with a proposed standard. Doc. 98 at17-19. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\noffer their own workable and reliable standard for judging partisan gerrymander claims.\nConsistent with Supreme Court precedent in this area, Plaintiffs’ proposed standard has an intent\nrequirementandaneffectrequirement. Weaddress theintentrequirementfirst.\n1. The State’s Predominant Intent In Drawing Several Districts In The\nAdoptedPlanWasTo AdvanceDemocraticPartisanInterests.\nTo establish the intent element of the proposed standard for judging partisan\ngerrymanders, Plaintiffs would have to prove that the State’s mapmakers created one or more\ncongressional districts with the predominant intent to secure partisan advantage. Plaintiffs could\ndo so with any direct or circumstantial evidence of such an intent, including evidence that the\nmapmakers disregarded traditional and neutral districting principles. This intent standard has the\nadvantage of paralleling the intent standard that applies to racial gerrymandering claims. See\n30\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 35 of 48 PageID #:1129\nMiller, 515 U.S. at 916. And it directly targets the “excessive” or “substantial” or “penalizing”\nuses of partisanship that have concerned the Supreme Court Justices who see a role for courts in\nstopping partisan gerrymandering. See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 463 (Stevens, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); Vieth, 541 U.S. at 314 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Davis, 478 U.S. at 133\n(pluralityopinion); id.at 171(Powell,J.,concurringinpart anddissentinginpart).\nThere is abundant direct and circumstantial evidence that the State’s mapmakers drew\nseveral districts intheAdoptedPlan withthepredominantintentofsecuringapartisan advantage\nfor the Democrats. To begin with, Democrats completely excluded Republicans from the\ndistricting process, and indeed did all they could to keep the process from public view. The\nDemocrats controlled both chambers of the General Assembly and the Governor’s mansion. See\nExs. A49-A51. They used the DCCC to create the map, trading drafts with the DCCC from the\nmoment census data became available. See Exs. A19, A22, A23, A28-A33, A35; see also Ex.\nA17 at29 (Rep. Schock told bystatelegislature staff that congressional map drawingwas left up\nto “[Senate] President Cullerton and Steve Israel with the DCCC”). They rejected the efforts of\n(Democratic) Congressman Jerry Costello to negotiate a bipartisan map. See Ex. A10 at 45, 85,\n89, 92, 104-05 (Costello Dep.).10 In hearings before the redistricting committees of the Illinois\n10 Rep. Costellotestified:“It was clearto mefrom both meetings [with the Democraticleaders of\nGeneral Assembly] that the Legislature was going forward doing their work to produce a map\nand in the end that that’s exactly what they were going to do, that our – I had tried on both\noccasions to say we think we can come up with a ten, eight map, but that I felt that based upon\nthe conversations that the Legislature is moving forward and I didn’t think we would see a ten,\neight map.” Ex. A10 at 104. Congressman John Shimkus confirmed that the DCCC would not\nprovide shape files to aid his and Rep. Costello’s effort to negotiate a bipartisan map, at which\npoint Costello “realized that other influences, Senator Durbin, Congresswoman Schakowsky,\nPresident Cullerton, were taking over the map process.” Ex. A18 at 69. Congressman Peter\nRoskam likewise testified that “based on the conversations that [he] had with [Illinois Senate\nPresident John] Cullerton, it was clear that there was an agenda to move a map forward that was\ngoing to create a great advantage to the Democrats and they weren’t interested in substantive\ninput into it.” Ex. A16 at 37-38. Finally, Congressman Jesse Jackson has said that while “seven\n31\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 36 of 48 PageID #:1130\nHouse and Senate, the Democratic chairpersons ofthose committees refused to field questions or\nprovide a draft map (to the public or their Republican colleagues), despite promises to do so. See\nEx. A40 at 165; Ex. A41 at 69, 73, 77. And after publicly disclosing the proposed map for the\nfirst time at 4:00 a.m. on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, the Democrats in the General\nAssembly passed the map on a strict party-line basis with votes on Memorial Day in the House\nandthenextdayintheSenate. SeeExs.A44,A46,A47,A67.\nMeanwhile, behind the scenes, the Democratic leadership of the General Assembly and\nits mapmaking partner, the DCCC, did not mince words in describing their shared goals for\nremapping the districts held by Republicans. In February 2011, a DCCC representative (Ian\nRussell) thanked the chief of staff for the Senate President John Cullerton (Andy Manar) for his\nguidance on how to “advance our goal—more Democratic pick-ups.” Ex. A19. Two weeks later,\nRussell suggested several potential districts aimed at getting “Democratic performance” above\n50%, including one linking Rockford and Rock Island and another connecting\nChampaign/Urbana, Decatur, Springfield, and Bloomington/Normal. Ex. A22. That same week,\nManar asked Russell for maps reflecting “potential pick-ups,” and Russell responded that the\nDCCC was “open to discussing how to maximize pick-up opportunities.” Ex. A23. Thereafter,\nthrough Apriland May, theDCCCfed SenatePresidentCullerton’sstaff withideasabouthowto\nmake various districts “more Democratic” (Ex. A28) and achieve the “goal” to “maximize\nDemocraticperformance”(Ex.A30).\nA May 24, 2011 DCCC memo addressed directly to Senate President Cullerton is\nparticularly revealing. The memo first acknowledges that a map presented by the State\nof the Democrat representatives had voted for” the map “that Costello had showed” them, Jan\nSchakowsky “voted against it and she had won because she was greedy.” Ex. A9 at 19-20\n(BiggertDep.).\n32\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 37 of 48 PageID #:1131\nlegislature’s Democratic leadership at a May 21, 2011 meeting “redraws downstate Illinois with\nthe goal of providing a Democratic-leaning district stretching from Rock Island to Rockford and\nanother one pulling together the cities in downstate Illinois.” Ex. A31 at SEND2650. The memo\nthen proceeds to offersuggestions for “increas[ing]ourodds of makingat least oneand probably\ntwo downstate seats part of a durable majorityin the delegation,” including by“pairingthe Quad\nCities with Peoria.” Id. at SEND2651. Finally, boasting that “[a] critical part of the remapping\nprocess is altering the districts of incumbent Republicans to complicate their paths back to\nWashington,” the memo proposes “split[ting] Peoria in half, with the Democratic neighborhoods\ngoing into a Democratic-leaning district that runs north to the Quad Cities” and Peoria-based\n(Republican) Congressman Aaron Schock going into a “heavily Republican” (i.e., packed)\ndistrict.Id.\nThe Adopted Plan confirms that the Democratic leadership of the General Assembly was\ntaking the DCCC’s guidance to heart. Extending long tendrils eastward, Adopted District 17\nlinks the Quad Cities with the Democratic-leaning parts of Peoria and the Democratic-leaning\nparts of Rockford, leaving not just Congressmen Schock but also (Republican) Congressman\nDon Manzullo (from the Rockford area) in other districts. See Add. 51-52 (map of district); Ex.\nB at ¶ 35 (incumbent residences); Ex. A17 at 41-43 (Rep. Schock describing how the Adopted\nPlan divides Peoria by cutting the “large minority population center ... out of my district”); Ex.\nA15 at 18-21, 50 (Rep. Manzullo describing how the Adopted Plan divides Rockford by\n“mak[ing] the minorities on the West Side of Rockford nothing but an appendage to a new\ndistrict that’s formed to the west” even though Rockford has “never been divided since 1850”).11\n11 Indeed, Senate President Cullerton admitted to Congressman Schock, “we’ve decided that we\nare not going to beat you. So we are not going to waste our Democrat voters on you, and\n33\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 38 of 48 PageID #:1132\nDistrict 13 likewise pulls together Democratic-leaning parts of Springfield, Bloomington/\nNormal, and Champaign/Urbana with Decatur by sending arms off toward the east, north, and\nnorthwest. See Add. 41-42 (map of district). And District 11 zigzags across Chicago’s\nsouthwestern suburbs to link Democratic-leaning populations in Aurora and Joliet. See Add. 37-\n38 (map of district). Needless to say, none of these districts is particularly compact, with Polsby-\nPopper compactness scores ranging from 0.12 for District 11 to 0.19 for Districts 13 and 17. Ex.\nB at¶21.\nNor does the Adopted Plan reflect adherence to any other neutral redistricting principles.\nTheplandivides over50 towns withatleast25,000residentsbetween morethanone district. See\nEx. B19. With respect to districts currently represented by Republicans, moreover, the plan\nexhibits no intent to protect incumbents. To the contrary, the Adopted Plan places three\nRepublican incumbents (Biggert, Kinzinger, and Dold) into heavily Democratic districts with a\nDemocratic incumbent and places another two Republican incumbents (Walsh and Hultgren) in\nthe same district, while separating each Republican incumbent from his or her constituents to a\ngreater degree than it separates any Democratic incumbent from his or her constituents. See Ex.\nB at¶36.\nThe treatment of current District 13 is particularly indicative of the Adopted Plan’s\npartisan animus. The plan dismantles that compact district—long represented by (Republican)\nCongresswoman Judy Biggert—placing pieces of the district into six different districts (Districts\n1,3, 5, 6,11, and 14). SeeAdd.57-58(map); Ex.A9 at 50-51 (BiggertDep.). And itplaces Rep.\nBiggert’s Hinsdale home at the extreme tip of an extended southern appendage of a heavily\nDemocratic district (with a Democratic incumbent) that stretches from Lake Michigan to O’Hare\ncongratulations, we are giving you the most Republican district in the state.” Ex.

SeeAdd.57-58\n(map); Ex. B at ¶¶ 25, 35. Indeed, Defendants’ own expert has admitted that Rep. Biggert was\nplacedinAdoptedDistrict5for“politicalreasons.” Ex.A14at74-75(LichtmanDep.).\nTogether, all of the direct and circumstantial evidence leaves no doubt that the\npredominant intent behind the shape of several districts in the Adopted Plan (including Districts\n11, 13, and 17)was to secure apartisan advantage for the Democrats. See Davis, 478 U.S. at 129\n(“As long as redistricting is done bya legislature, it should not be very difficult to prove that the\nlikelypoliticalconsequences ofthereapportionmentwereintended.”).\n2. TheAdoptedPlanHas TheEffectofCreating PartisanGerrymanders\nInSeveralDistricts.\nUnder Plaintiffs’ suggested standard for judging partisan gerrymander claims, proving\nthe required discriminatory effect would require a showing of three things: (1) that the Adopted\nPlan increases the number of districts that favor Democrats by at least 10% according to an\naccepted measure of partisan voting; (2) that the Adopted Plan keeps at least 10% more\nconstituents of Democratic incumbents in the same district as their representative than it does\nconstituents of Republican incumbents; and (3) that at least one of the districts created with the\nintent to advantage Democrats is among the districts that contributes to the proof of elements 1\nand2.\nThatstandard is eminentlyworkable, as itrelies on simple and objective metrics. With its\nuse of a partisanship index to judge increases in districts that promise 50%+ Democratic\nperformance and its focus on changes that destabilize Republican incumbent-constituent\nrelationships, the standard also mirrors preciselythe kind of analysis that those in the business of\npartisan redistricting (like the DCCC) use in evaluating maps. See, e.g., Ex. A31 (discussing\nways to get “Democratic performance” above 50% and ways of “Destabilizing Republican\n35\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 40 of 48 PageID #:1134\nIncumbents”); Ex. A34 (discussing indices of DCCC and State Democrats); Ex. A28 (discussing\nDCCC formula for measuring partisan leanings). And like Plaintiffs’ suggested intent standard,\nthe effect standard properly targets the “excessive,” “substantial,” and “penalizing” uses of\npartisanship that theSupremeCourt deems unconstitutional, whilelinkingtheprohibited conduct\nto particular districts. See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 463 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part); Vieth, 541 U.S. at 314 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Davis, 478 U.S. at 133 (plurality\nopinion); id.at171(Powell,J.,concurringinpartanddissentinginpart).12\nThe evidence easily satisfies the proposed effect standard. The Adopted Plan increases\nthe number of districts that favor Democrats by well over 10%, according to the Partisan Voting\nIndex developed by Charlie Cook (“PVI”), the most widely used and accepted measure of\npartisan leanings for congressional districts.13 As the accompanying affidavit of Edward D.\nMarshall details, 9 of the 19 Illinois congressional districts (47.4%) have Democratic-leaning\nPVI scores under the current plan, which was adopted through a bipartisan process in 2001. See\nEx. B at ¶ 25; Ex. A39 (Conference Report adopted by vote of 46-10 in Senate and by vote of\n89-27 in House); Ex. A37 at 15 (“the incumbents ... negotiated, both bipartisan, Republican and\nDemocrat,to comeup with this map”). Bycontrast, undertheAdopted Plan,12 ofthe18 Illinois\ncongressional districts (66.7%) have Democratic-leaning PVI scores. Ex. B at ¶ 25. That 19.3\n12 Plus, the 10% deviation figures used in the proposed standard mirror the 10% population\ndeviation figure that establishes a prima facie violation of the one-person-one-vote rule in the\nredistrictingofstatelegislatures. SeeBrownv. Thomson,462U.S.835,842-843(1983).\n13 The PVI is a measurement of how strongly a congressional district leans toward one political\nparty compared to the nation as a whole. The index for each congressional district is derived by\naveraging its results from the prior two presidential elections and comparing them to national\nresults. The index indicates which party’s candidate was more successful in that district, as well\nas the number of percentage points bywhich its results exceeded the national average. The index\nis formatted as a letter followed by a plus sign and then a number. For instance, in a district\nwhose PVI score is D+2, a generic Democratic candidate would be expected to receive 2\npercentage points more votes than the national average. An “Even” score is assigned when the\ndistrictperformedwithin halfapointofthenationalaverage.SeeEx.Bat¶24;Ex.A63.\n36\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 41 of 48 PageID #:1135\npercentage point increase in Democratic-leaning districts far exceeds the 10% increase required\nbythesuggestedstandard.\nThe Adopted Plan also keeps far more constituents of Democratic incumbents in the\nsame district as their representative than it does constituents of Republican incumbents. As the\nMarshall Affidavit shows, between 100.0% and 76.4% of Democratic-represented constituents\nremain in the same district as their representative, with an average of 87.8% across all\nDemocratic incumbents. Ex. B at ¶¶ 35, 36. Republican-represented constituents fare much\nworse, with between 67.9% and 1.3% remaining in the same district as their representative—\n34.4%on average. Seeid. The53.4 percentage point spread in average constituent-representative\ncarryovermorethanquintuplesthe10%differencerequiredbytheproposedeffectstandard.\nFinally, thedistricts that theDemocraticleadership of theGeneral Assemblymostclearly\nintended to partisan gerrymander—Districts 11, 13, and 17—all exhibit the effects of that effort.\nEach district has a Democratic-leaning PVI score—D+5 for Adopted District 11, D+1 for\nAdopted District 13, and D+7 for Adopted District 17. See Ex. B at ¶ 25. Adopted Districts 13\nand 17 contain Republican incumbents separated from large numbers of their constituents\n(70.5% of Rep. Johnson’s constituents would reside outside of District 13, and 48.1% of Rep.\nSchilling’s constituents would reside outside of District 17). See Ex. B at ¶ 36. And Adopted\nDistrict 11, which is carved largely out of Congresswoman Biggert’s current district, severs all\nrepresentative relationships for every single person in the district. See Add. 37-38, 57-58\n(maps);Ex.Bat¶36.\nIn sum, the evidence of a partisan gerrymander is overwhelming. The Adopted Plan\nshould be invalidated as a violation of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of\ntheFourteenthAmendment.\n37\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 42 of 48 PageID #:1136\nII. TheCourtShouldImplementPlaintiffs’ProposedPlan.\nPlaintiffs’ proposed redistricting map (the “Fair Plan”) redresses the numerous statutory\nandconstitutionalviolations in theAdoptedPlan.SeeAdd. 59-60 (statewide Fair Plan); Add. 61-\n62 (Chicago-area Fair Plan). Specifically, the Fair Plan eliminates the Adopted Plan’s intentional\ndilution of Latino voters, respects traditional race-neutral redistricting criteria while complying\nwith Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and rectifies the Democratic-controlled General\nAssembly’sbackroompartisan gerrymander.14\nThe Fair Plan remedies the intentional vote dilution and racial gerrymandering of the\nAdopted Plan by splitting the two unnaturally linked “muffs” of Adopted District 4 and making\none “muff” part of a compact district on the north side (Fair District 3) and one “muff” part of a\ncompact district on the south side (Fair District 4). Add. 61-62 (Chicago-area Fair Plan); Add.\n63-64 (Fair District 3); Add. 65-66 (Fair District 4). Doing so first and foremost unpacks\nAdopted District 4, ending the illegal “packing” of that district. See supra pp. 18-19. Fair\nDistrict4(inthesouth)and FairDistrict3(inthenorth)arethenaturalresultofthatunpacking.\nFair District 4, in turn, ends the dilution of Latino votes in the near southwestern part of\nChicagoland by combining the unpacked southern portion of Adopted District 4 with adjacent\nportions of Adopted District3 where Latino votes otherwisewouldbe diluted. Seesupra pp. 19-\n20. Fair District 4 will have a Latino VAP of 59.4%, which is plainly sufficient to “provide[]\nLatinos with a viable opportunityto elect a representative of their choice, without continuing the\npacking of Latinos in it, and without continuing the bizarre earmuff shape.” Ex. A2 at 11\n(Engstrom Rep.). Fair District 4’s 59.4% Latino VAP is “virtually the same as that figure for the\noriginal version of the earmuff, adopted in 1991, which was 59.2%.” Id.; see Ex. A1 at 13\n14 The Fair Plan also meets the Constitution’s “one-person, one-vote” requirement, as the\npopulation is equally distributed among the 18 districts in the Fair Plan. See Reynolds v. Sims,\n377U.S.533(1964);Ex.B at¶20.\n38\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 43 of 48 PageID #:1137\n(reporting Latino VAP). In 1991, the Hastert court concluded that a district with 59.2% Latino\nVAP was sufficient to provide Latinos the “opportunity to exercise political control over the\nHispanic majority district.” 777 F. Supp. at 648 n.2, 651. And that prediction was borne out\nwhen Luis Gutierrez was elected to office the following year with nearly 60% of the Democratic\nprimary vote and 78% of the general election vote and was re-elected time and again by wide\nmargins. See Ex. B at ¶ 37. Tellingly, Defendants have not argued that Fair District 4—at 59.4%\nLatinoVAP—isnotaneffectivedistrict.\nLikewise, Fair District3 ends thedilution of Latino votes in thenear northwestern partof\nChicagoland by combining the unpacked northern portion of Adopted District 4 with adjacent\nportions of Adopted District 5 where Latino votes would otherwise be diluted. See supra p. 20.\nIn Fair District 3, Latinos will constitute 46.5% of the VAP, which will give Latinos a plurality\ninthedistrict.Ex.A2at13(Engstrom Rep.);Ex.A6at18,22(Engstrom Rep.). Latinosthuswill\nhave a strong opportunity to “influence the outcomes of elections in [Fair District] 3.” Ex. A2 at\n13 (Engstrom Rep.). The portion of Illinois that Fair District 3 encompasses is highly\nDemocratic, and therefore the election of consequence in determining who is sent to Congress to\nrepresent Fair District 3 is the Democratic primary. Id. at 14. With 46.5% of the VAP in Fair\nDistrict 3, Latinos (who disproportionally vote Democratic) will have a good chance to control\nthe outcome of the Democratic primary, and therefore will have the opportunity to send their\nchosenrepresentativetoCongress. Id.at13-14.\nSplitting Adopted District 4 also necessarily breaks down that district’s unconstitutional\nracial gerrymander. See supra pp. 6-16. And neither of the Fair Plan’s replacement districts\nrevives such a gerrymander. In judging racial gerrymander claims, the Supreme Court has\nfocused on the shape of districts—especially their compactness and contiguity—because\n39\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 44 of 48 PageID #:1138\n“reapportionment is one area in which appearances do matter.” Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 647; see\nMiller, 515 U.S. at 916 (listing “compactness” and “contiguity” as “traditional race-neutral\ndistricting principles”). Unlike the “bizarre shape” and “hypertechnical” contiguity of Adopted\nDistrict 4 (King II, 979 F. Supp. at 625; King I, 979 F. Supp. at 609 n.49), Fair Districts 3 and 4\nare both regularly shaped, highly compact, and fully contiguous. The numbers back up that\nobservation. Using the Polsby-Popper measure of perimeter length, Fair District 3 scores .22 and\nFair District 4 scores .34, far better than Adopted District 4’s .05 score. See Ex. B at ¶ 21. There\nis simply no reason to believe that either Fair District 3 or Fair District 4 was predominantly\nmotivated by racial classifications, as opposed to simply being the natural result of the necessary\ndismantlingofAdopted District4.15\nIndeed, Plaintiffs could not have configured Fair Districts 3 and 4 much differently\nwithout doing violence to the cores of surrounding districts. Drawing a district including the\n15 Defendants’ expert Dr. Lichtman argues that race was the predominant factor in the\nconfiguration of Fair District 3 because a large number of Latinos were “extracted from existing\nCD4” and from Districts 5, 6, 7, and 9 (Ex. A3 at 13-19) and moved to Fair District 3. As\nexplained above, the shift of Latino population from the existing District 4 results simply from\nundoing the improper “packing” of Latinos into that district.Dr. Morrison explained in his\nrebuttal report that “[t]he reductions in CD6, CD7, and CD9 are de minimis (less than 2%).”Ex.\nA5 at 7. And the shift of population from existing District 5 to Fair District 3 was necessary to\nbringFair District 3 up to therequired population and to reconstitutethecompactand contiguous\nLatino community of interest whose voting power the Adopted Plan discriminatorily dilutes.As\nfor Dr. Lichtman’s supposition that racial gerrymandering must explain the instances in which\nFair District 3’s splits precincts (Ex. A7 at 19), an analysis of the very data that Dr. Lichtman\nprovided in his supplemental report belies that conclusion. First, of the 77 “precinct splits” that\nLichtman identifies, 24 instances are not true “splits” at all, since the line-drawing merely chops\noff a portion of a precinct in which no population resides. See, e.g., Ex. A8 at Line 23. The\nremaining 53 splits resulted in the addition of only 7,356 Latinos residing in the district, which\namounts to only 1% of the district’s total population. Plus, in 16 of the 53 splits (30%), the area\nexcluded from Fair District 3 had a higher Latino concentration than the area included, refuting\nany suggestion that race accounted for those splits. Id. And nearly half of the 53 splits (24)\ninvolved the border between Fair District 3 and District 7, which is one of the African American\nmajority-minority districts, and thus indicate only an intent to maintain an adequately high\nAfrican AmericanconcentrationinDistrict7.\n40\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 45 of 48 PageID #:1139\nnorthern part of Adopted District 4 in a materially different, but still compact and contiguous,\nwaywould haveundulyimpinged on theAfrican-American majoritydistrict to thesouth (current\nDistrict 7) or the core of the current District 5 to the east (represented by Democrat Mike\nQuigley).See Add. 3-4 (current districts); Add. 61-62 (Fair Districts). And going north would\nhave unnecessarily forced Rep. Quigley and fellow Democratic incumbent Jan Schakowsky into\nthe same district. Id. Repositioning the district encompassing the southern half of Adopted\nDistrict 4, while maintaining compactness and contiguity, similarly would have disrupted\nAfrican-American majority District 7 to the north and east. Id. Holding District 7 as a constant,\nthe onlydirection in which a district encompassing the southern half of the earmuff could spread\nwassouthandwest,whereFairDistrict4does in factspread.\nMoreover, even if Fair District 4 could be deemed to be a racial gerrymander, it still\nwould not violate theConstitution. Even moresothan the bizarrelyshaped predecessorDistrict4\nthat King II, 979 F. Supp. at 620, upheld following 1991 redistricting, Fair District 4 is narrowly\ntailoredtoachievethecompellingstateinterestofcomplyingwith Section 2oftheVotingRights\nAct. Plaintiffs, unlike Defendants, have shown that there is a “strong basis in evidence”\nestablishing that each of the three Gingles preconditions are met with respect to Plaintiff’s Fair\nDistrict 4. See Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 908-09 n.4. The area’s Latino population is “sufficiently\nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in” Fair District 4 (Thornburg v.\nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986)), given that the district would contain 59.4% Latino VAP.\nThe Latino vote is politically cohesive. Ex. A2 at 8 (Engstrom Rep.); Ex. A6 at 3 (Engstrom\nRep.). And absent the districts, the white majority vote would be sufficiently cohesive to usually\ndefeat the preferred candidate of Latinos. Id. Fair District 4 is narrowly tailored because it\nachieves the required Latino-majority district without unnecessarily “packing” Latino voters and\n41\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 46 of 48 PageID #:1140\nwithout subordinating the traditional districting principles of compactness and contiguity. See\nsuprapp.14-16.\nFinally, the Fair Plan fully remedies the Adopted Plan’s partisan gerrymander by\nreplacing the Adopted Districts with ones that bear none of the hallmarks of partisan\ngerrymandering. Defendants have adduced no evidence that suggests that the Fair Plan was\ndrawn with the predominant intent of securing a partisan advantage for Republicans. See supra\npp. 30-31.To the contrary, the evidence shows thatthe Fair Plan respects traditional redistricting\nprinciplesfarbetterthan theAdoptedPlan.\nTheFairPlancertainlybetter“respect[s]countyandmunicipalboundaries”(LULAC,548\nU.S. at451)and shows more “respectforpoliticalsubdivisionsorcommunitiesdefinedbyactual\nshared interests” (Miller, 515 U.S. at 916). As discussed above, the Adopted Plan fractures\nhistorically Republican communities, particularly in the Chicago suburbs. See Ex. A9 at 50-51\n(Biggert Dep.). For example, DuPage County is divided into six districts. See Ex. B18 (table of\ncounty splits); Add. 57-58 (map). In total, the Adopted Plan splits 18 counties, while the Fair\nPlan only splits 13.16 Ex. B18. The Adopted Plan splits 54 municipalities with populations of\n25,000ormore,whiletheFair Planonlysplits 30suchmunicipalities. SeeEx.B19.17\nFurthermore, the Fair Plan does not wrongfullydiscriminate against Democrats under the\neffect standard that Plaintiffs have proposed. See supra p. 35. First, under the Fair Plan, 8 of the\n18 Illinois congressional districts (44.4%) would have Democratic-leaning PVI scores, as\n16 And when the Adopted Plan and Fair Plan both split a county, the split is much less\npronounced in the Fair Plan. See Ex. B18 (detailing how Adopted Plan divides counties into\nmoredistricts).\n17 Forinstance,the FairPlan maintains Rockford inonedistrict,as has beenthecasesince1850,\nratherthan dividingthe“whitecommunityinRockfordfromthe Latinos,theAfrican-Americans,\ntheThais,theVietnamese,theCambodians andtheBurmese”astheAdoptedPlan does.Ex.A15\nat18,21(ManzulloDep.); seealsoEx.B19;Add.55-56(map).\n42\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 47 of 48 PageID #:1141\ncompared to 9 of 19 (47.4%) among the existing districts adopted in 2001. See Ex. B at ¶ 25.\nThat 3 percentage point decrease is insufficient to establish any improperly partisan effect.\nSecond, under the Fair Plan, an average of 61.0% of Democrat-represented constituents would\nremain in districts in which their current representatives would reside, while 52.7% of\nRepublican-represented constituents would remain in districts in which their current\nrepresentatives would reside. See Ex. B at ¶ 36. That 2.4 percentage point spread (in favor of\nDemocratsnoless)falls shortoftherequisite10 pointshift.\nFor all of the above reasons, the Court should implement Plaintiffs’ Fair Plan. When the\nIllinois General Assembly “fail[s] to perform [its] duty” of acceptably reconfiguring Illinois’s\ncongressional districts, the task “falls to this court by default.” Hastert, 777 F. Supp. at 640-41.\nThis Court has ample familiarity with selecting and ordering the implementation of\nreapportionment maps in Illinois. See, e.g.,id. at 641 &n.6; Vigo Cnty. Republican Cent. Comm.\nv. Vigo Cnty. Comm’rs, 834 F. Supp. 1080, 1086 (S.D. Ind. 1993) (Tinder, J.) (striking down\nredistricting plan and ordering implementation of plaintiffs’ proposed plan that was “more\ncontiguous, more compact, and more respectful of natural boundaries”). The extremely short\ntime period before the primary election, which is scheduled for March 20, 2012, and the time\nrequired for candidates and voters to prepare for that election require that the Court adopt a plan\nwithoutdelay. See10 ILCS5/7-12. Thelastdayto filepetitions forpartynominations forUnited\nStates Congress for the 2012 Illinois primaryelection is December 5, 2011. Id. Fortunately, once\nthe Court adopts the Fair Plan, Defendant Illinois State Board of Elections will quickly and\neasily be able to implement it. The 30(b)(6) witness for the State Board of Elections, Eric J.\nDonnewald, testified that if the Court were to order the SBE to implement the Fair Plan, the\n43\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 105 Filed: 11/04/11 Page 48 of 48 PageID #:1142\nimplementation process “would be similarto the development of the current congressional lines”\nandcouldbecompletedinashorttimeperiod.Ex.A11at129-35(DonnewaldDep.).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfullyrequest that the Court grant their motion\nforapermanentinjunction.\nDated:November4,2011 Respectfullysubmitted,\n/s/ LoriE.

Without any of the promised public hearings, the State of Illinois has adopted a\nnew map for the state’s federal congressional districts (the “Proposed Congressional Plan”) that\nblatantly discriminates against Latino and Republican voters.1 As a result of the Proposed\n1 Images of the Proposed Congressional Plan—taken from the Illinois General Assembly’s\nwebsite at http://www.ilga.gov/CongressionalDistrictMaps/Statewide%20View.pdf and at\nhttp://www.ilga.gov/CongressionalDistrictMaps/Cook%20and%20Collar%20County\n%20View.pdf—are attached to this complaint as Exhibits A and B. Images of the current\ncongressional map—taken from the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Atlas of the United\nStates, available at http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd112_il.pdf—\nare attached to this complaint as Exhibits C and D. A table reflecting demographic information\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 2 of 40 PageID #:2\nCongressional Plan, Latino voters are packed into a single congressional district racially\ngerrymandered to capture an unnecessarily excessive supermajority of Latino voters, so that the\nvotes of Latinos inside and outside that district are unlawfully diluted. Similarly, the Proposed\nCongressional Plan—which the New York Times has called “[p]erhaps the most aggressive\nexample of partisan maneuvering” to arise out of the 2010 national census2—effectivelyreverses\nthe results of the 2010 congressional elections by redrawing districts so that the citizens of\nIllinois that gave Republicans an 11 to 8 advantage in Illinois’s congressional delegation only\nnine months ago would see the state’s congressional delegation transformed to one with 12\nDemocrats and only 6 Republicans (with Illinois having lost one seat in national\nreapportionment). Thelawdoes not permit suchobviouslydiscriminatorygerrymandering.\n2. By packing excessive numbers of Latino voters into the proposed 4th\ncongressional district, the Proposed Congressional Plan violates the Equal Protection Clause of\ntheFourteenth Amendment,theFifteenth Amendment,andSection2of theVotingRights Act of\n1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. It sacrifices the interests of Latino voters in favor of preserving and\nstrengthening white majorities in the proposed congressional districts that surround proposed\nDistrict 4—proposed District 3 and proposed District 5. Packing Latino voters into proposed\nDistrict 4 unnecessarily “wastes” the supermajority of Latino votes in that district, while also\ndiluting the influence of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3 and 5. The Proposed\nCongressional Plan converts the District 4 that was created in 1991 in order to provide\nrepresentation to Latinos into one that now denies effective representation to Latinos. That\nabout the racial and ethnic composition of the proposed and current congressional districts is\nattached as Exhibit E.\n2 Jennifer Steinhauer, For Republicans, Redistricting Offers Few Gains, New York Times,\nA12(June12,2011).\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 3 of 40 PageID #:3\nintentional discrimination against Latino voters is precisely the kind of conduct outlawed by\nSection2oftheVotingRights Act,theEqual ProtectionClause,andthe FifteenthAmendment.\n3. District 4 of the Proposed Congressional Plan also independently violates the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it is an intentional and\nunjustified racial gerrymander. The tortured “earmuff” shape of District 4, coupled with its\nextremely large Latino population and the judicially established facts about the creation of the\ndistrict after the 1990 census, leave no doubt that race was the predominant factor in drawing the\ndistrict and that the district therefore is a racial gerrymander. And even if there were a\ncompellingstate interest in creatingsuch a district, proposed District 4 is not narrowlytailored to\naccomplish that interest. Given the current Latino voting age population in Cook County and\nnearby, the “earmuff” district no longer complies with the Fourteenth Amendment because there\nare other viable and constitutionallypermissible alternatives to proposed District 4. The district,\ntherefore,is unconstitutional.\n4. The Proposed Congressional Plan also is a partisan gerrymander that violates the\nFirst Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The map as a\nwhole and several individual districts in particular represent a flexing of Democratic political\nmuscle in Springfield aimed at creating a Democratic majority in the Illinois congressional\ndelegation, regardless of the actual preferences of the electorate demonstrated only nine months\nago. It dismantles traditional areas ofRepublican influencesuch as DuPageCounty,dilutingthat\ninfluence across multiple districts, many carefully connected to traditional areas of Democratic\nstrength. At the same time, the map packs Republican incumbents into the same districts or\nsqueezes Republicanincumbents intoDemocratic-leaningdistricts withDemocraticincumbents.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 4 of 40 PageID #:4\n5. The dismantling of Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert’s current\ncongressional District 13 in Southern DuPage, Northern Will, and Southwestern Cook Counties\nis particularly striking. Under the Proposed Congressional Plan, Republican-leaning portions of\ncurrent District 13 are packed into proposed Districts 6 and 14. The removal of those voters\nfrom current District 13 allows for the creation of proposed Districts 3 and 11, which are\nblatantlygerrymandered, irregularlyshaped districts drawn with no apparent reason other than to\nencompass sufficient Democratic voters from Democratic strongholds such as Aurora, Joliet, or\nChicago’s southwest side to create new districts with 51% Democratic majorities. Adding insult\nto injury, proposed District 5 sweeps in a curving hook from the Lake Michigan shoreline on the\nnorth side of Chicago around the Latino enclaves on Chicago’s west side that are packed into\nproposed District 4 until it just catches Congresswoman Biggert’s suburban Hinsdale home at its\nverytip.\n6. In short, as another New York Times article noted, “[n]o matter their repeated\nattempts to justify the jigsaw puzzle based on census changes, Democrats took a razor to their\ncolleagues’ domain. They activated every switch at their disposal: clout, secrecy and spools of\nelectronic data that guided block-by-block precision.”3 That back-room precision was used both\ntodisenfranchise Latinovoters andto guideanoutrageous partisan gerrymander.\n7. Plaintiffs therefore file this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to\nprevent theuseoftheProposedCongressional Planinanyfuture elections.\n3 Kristen McQueary, Incumbents Carve Out a New Congressional Map, New York Times,\nA17B(June3,2011).\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 5 of 40 PageID #:5\nII. JURISDICTIONAND VENUE\n8. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343,\nand 1357. Plaintiffs bring claims arisingunder the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nand42U.S.C.§1973for violations oftheircivil rights andelectivefranchise.\n9. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because all defendants reside in\nIllinois and because some of the defendants reside in the Northern District of Illinois. ByIllinois\nlaw, Defendant Illinois State Board of Elections is required to maintain an office in the City of\nChicago. 10 ILCS § 5/1A-11. Pursuant to that requirement, the Illinois State Board of Elections\nmaintains an office at 100 W. Randolph Street, Suite 14-100, Chicago, Illinois. Illinois law also\nrequires four board members of the State Board of Elections to be residents of Cook County. 10\nILCS § 5/1A-2. Defendant board members Ernest Gowen, William McGuffage, Judith Rice, and\nBryanSchneider resideinCookCounty.\nIII. PARTIES\nA. Plaintiffs\n10.

As a result of the decennial national census (hereinafter “the 2010 Census”) and\ncongressional reapportionment,theStateof Illinois lost oneofits existingnineteencongressional\ndistricts. Beginning in the next Congress, Illinois will have eighteen members of the United\nStates HouseofRepresentatives.\n37. The Illinois General Assembly and the Governor of Illinois are charged with the\nduty to enact a plan for dividing the state into congressional districts. In the 2010 elections,\ndespite gains by Republicans in both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly, Democrats\nretained majority control of both the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate.\nAdditionally, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate won a very close election. As a result, the\nDemocraticPartyenjoys unifiedpartisancontrol ofstate government.\nA. TheBack-RoomProcess ThatResulted In TheProposed Congressional Plan\n38. Pursuant to 10 ILCS 125/10-5, beginning on March 28, 2011 and continuing\nthrough May 2, 2011, members of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate\nheld a series of hearings at locations around the state. The hearings were conducted by the\nIllinois Senate Redistricting Committee and the Illinois House Redistricting Committee. The\nchairpersons of those committees—State Senator Kwame Raoul, a Democrat, and House\nMajority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie, also a Democrat—controlled the conduct of the\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 10 of 40 PageID #:10\nhearings.4 Members of the public were permitted to comment, in theory, on the redistricting\nprocess and their respective communities of interest. However, pursuant to a rule established by\nthe Democratic chairpersons of the committees, members of the public were not permitted to ask\nquestions of the members of the Redistricting Committees. As stated by Senator Raoul at the\nfirst hearing after the state legislative map was released, “We’re taking input today. We’re not\nfielding questions.”5 In addition, during the purported public hearings, the Democratic-\ncontrolled committee never presented any draft or proposed congressional maps or redistricting\nplanforthepublictoconsider.\n39. With respect to the congressional reapportionment plan, numerous commenters\nurged that “it’s crucial that input be heard after draft maps are released and when we can give\nspecific feedback about how the lines will affect our communities.”6 Moreover, numerous\ncitizen commenters, as well as Republican legislators, implored the Democratic leadership of the\ncommittees to release proposed maps at least one or two weeks before any vote would be taken,\nto allow for public comment.7 Chairman Raoul pledged to do precisely that, stating “[i]t’s my\n4 Seehttp://www.ilsenateredistricting.com.\n5 SenatorKwameRaoul, Illinois StateSenateHearing(May21,2011),at 69.\n6 http://www.ilga.gov/senate/Committees/Redistricting/Final%20Approved%20Transcript\n%20for%20Senate%20Redistricting%20Hearing%203.28.11.pdf, at 37.

On May 18, 2011, the Democratic leadership of the Redistricting Committees\nreleased a proposed state legislative map on the Illinois Senate Redistricting Committee website.\nThe congressional map was not released at that time. Redistricting Committees in the Illinois\nSenate and the Illinois House of Representatives held three hearings—on May 21, 22, and 24,\n2011—on the proposed state map. During those meetings, several public commenters pleaded\nfortheimmediaterelease ofthecongressional map,tonoavail.9\nbefore a vote so that communities can have interests and have their input.”); id. at 79 (“And so,\nlastly, as was mentioned with our coalition, what we’re calling on the General Assemblyto do is\npresent the potential redistricting maps at least a week before the vote so that we can provide\ninput.”); id. at 81 (“present potential redistricting maps to the public at least one week before a\nvote so that the communities can provide input”); id. at 89 (“While we appreciate the scheduling\nof these hearings to receive input, we think, as Senator Righter has pointed out, it is also critical\nto have hearings after the relevant legislative committees have developed their proposed maps\nandat least twoweeks beforeanyvoteis taken.”).\n8 Id.at 165.\n9 Rev.

At approximately 4:00 a.m., in the early morning hours of Friday, May 27, 2011,\nonly hours before the start of Memorial Day Weekend, the Democratic leadership of the\nRedistricting Committees released a proposed congressional district map, SB 1178, for the first\ntime,postingthemapon its website. Nopublichearings wereheld.\n42. On Sunday, May 29, 2011, during Memorial Day Weekend, the Redistricting\nCommittee of the Illinois House of Representatives passed SB 1178 on a straight party-line vote\n(6-4). The next day the committee passed an amendment making a modest change to district\nlines inSouthern Illinois.\n43. On Memorial Day, Monday, May 30, 2011, the full Illinois House of\nRepresentatives took up and passed the bill as amended on a straight party line vote (63-54, with\none Republican voting present). The House debate lasted approximately 40 minutes before a\nvote on the bill was called on an issue that will determine the rights of Illinois voters for the next\ndecade. In committee and on the House floor, Republican members of the House questioned\nwhy the Democratic leadership failed to have public hearings on the Congressional map, failed\nto explain why there was only one majority-Latino district, why the proposed districts appeared\nless compact than the current districts, and why the proposed districts divided recognized\ncommunities ofinterest.\n44. On Monday, May 30, 2011, just hours after the bill passed the House, the\nRedistricting Committee of the Illinois Senate passed the amended bill on a straight party-line\nvote(10-7).\n45. The full Senate passed the bill the next day, again on a straight party line vote\n(34-25). At no time before the General Assembly passed SB 1178 into law did the Democrats\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 13 of 40 PageID #:13\ncontrolling either chamber allow for any public comment on the actual Proposed Congressional\nPlan.\n46. On Friday, June 24, 2011, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed SB 1178 into law.\nThebill tookeffect immediatelyuponbecominglaw.\nB. TheProposed Congressional Plan Disenfranchises LatinoVoters by PackingThem\nintoaSingleCongressional District\n47. According to the 2010 Census, Latinos are now the largest minority group in the\nstateof Illinois.\n48. Accordingtothe2010Census,thetotal populationfor Illinois is 12,830,632.\n49. Ofthat total,the Latinopopulationis 2,027,578,or15.8%.\n50. The total population for the next largest minority group, African-Americans, is\n1,866,414,or14.5%.\n51. Latinos comprise a growing proportion of the population of Illinois and Cook\nCounty. Statewide, Latinos have increased from 12.3% of all residents in 1990 to 15.8% in\n2010. In the same time period, the Latino population of Cook County has almost doubled,\nincreasingfrom 13.6%in1990to24.0%in2010.\n52. Despite Illinois’s large and growing Latino population, the Proposed\nCongressional Plan contains only one majority Latino district, District 4, out of the eighteen\ndistricts created. Latinos make up 65.92% of the proposed District 4 voting age population and\n71.07% of the total population, far more than is necessary to allow the election of a candidate\nwhois the choice of Latinovoters. Nootherproposeddistrict has a Latinovotingage population\nthat exceeds 25% of the district’s voting age population. But seven other districts have a Latino\nvotingagepopulationthat exceeds 10%.\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 14 of 40 PageID #:14\n53. The district with the next largest Latino population in the Proposed Congressional\nPlan is proposed District 3, which borders proposed District 4 on the south. Its voting age\npopulation is 24.64% Latino. That figure represents a reduction in the percentage of Latino\nvotingage population in current District 3, which is currently29.31% Latino. Congressman Dan\nLipinski, who is white, represents current District 3 and resides in proposed District 3. Proposed\nDistrict 3 was drawn to protect the ability of the white majority in the proposed district to defeat\nthecandidateofchoicefor Latinovoters.\n54. The district that borders proposed District 4 on the north and west is proposed\nDistrict 5. Its voting age population is 16.05% Latino. That figure represents a reduction in the\npercentage of Latino voting age population in current District 5, which is currently 24.56%\nLatino. Congressman Mike Quigley, who is white, represents current District 5 and resides in\nproposed District 5. Proposed District 5 was drawn to protect the abilityof the white majorityin\ntheproposeddistrict todefeat the candidateofchoicefor Latinovoters.\n55. The Latino population of the State of Illinois and Cook County is\ndisproportionately under the age of 18. As juvenile Latinos attain voting age over the next ten\nyears, Latinos will constituteagrowingpercentageofthevotingagepopulation.\n56. Latino voters traditionally and consistentlyvote cohesivelyin the State of Illinois,\nparticularlyinCookCounty.\n57. Traditionally, elections in Illinois have been racially and ethnically polarized.\nThe two other large racial and ethnic populations in Illinois, white non-Latinos and African-\nAmericans, have often voted sufficiently as blocks that, in the absence of special circumstances\noralarge Latinovoterpopulation,thepreferred candidates of Latinovoters havebeendefeated.\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 15 of 40 PageID #:15\n58. The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally discriminates against and dilutes\nthe votes of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3, 4, and 5—including Plaintiffs Lou Sandoval,\nRalph Rangel, Luis Sanabria, and Michelle Caballero (collectively, the “Racial Dilution\nPlaintiffs”)—by unnecessarily packing Latino voters into proposed District 4 and thereby\nreducingthe Latinovoter populationinproposedDistricts 3and5.\nC. TheProposed Congressional Plan ImpermissiblyUses Racial GerrymanderingTo\nCreateAMajorityLatinoDistrict\n59. Proposed District 4 is gerrymandered in an “earmuff” shape with the two “muffs”\ncapturing predominately Latino neighborhoods to the north and south of proposed District 7, a\nmajority African-American district. The predominately Latino neighborhoods are connected\nonlybytheearmuff’s “headband,”anarrowstrip runningalongU.S. Interstate294.\n60. A Latino majority district with a very similar shape was created in the same\nlocationafterthe1990 census injudicial proceedings overredistricting. At that time,thenumber\nof Latinos livingin Cook Countywas roughlyhalf of its current number, and it was believed that\nthe “earmuff” district was the only way to create a Latino majority congressional district in\nIllinois. The Latinovotingagepopulationinthe post-1990District 4was 59.18%.\n61. Judicial proceedings concerning the post-1990 District 4 established that race—\nthat is, Latinoethnicity—was thepredominant considerationinthecreationofthat district.\n62. Latino ethnicity was the predominant consideration in the creation of proposed\nDistrict 4. No other factor explains the “earmuff” shape of the proposed district or the extremely\nhighconcentrationof Latinovoters intheproposeddistrict.\n63. Proposed District 4 is far less compact than other districts in the Proposed\nCongressional Plan.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 16 of 40 PageID #:16\n64. Proposed District 4’s 0.05 Circularity Ratio—i.e., the ratio of the area of the\nproposed districts to the area of a circle having the same perimeter—is the lowest of any district\nin the Proposed Congressional Plan. It is also lower than the Plan’s average of 0.16. Smaller\nnumbers indicateless compactness.\n65. Proposed District 4’s 0.24 ratio between the circumference of an equal area circle\ndivided bythe perimeter of the district is the lowest of anydistrict in the Proposed Congressional\nPlan. It is also lower than the Plan’s average of 0.41. Smaller numbers indicate less\ncompactness.\n66. Proposed District 4’s 0.42 Schwartzberg Test ratio—i.e., district area divided by\nthe area of the district’s convex hull—is the lowest of any district in the Proposed Congressional\nPlan. It is also lower than the Plan’s average of 0.61. Smaller numbers indicate less\ncompactness.\n67. Proposed District 4 is not narrowly tailored to serve the State of Illinois’s interest\nin complying with Section 2 of Voting Rights Act. A more compact and less bizarrely shaped,\nmajority-Latinodistrict that respects traditional redistrictingprinciples can becreated.\n68. The Proposed Congressional Plan impermissibly classifies the citizens of\nproposed District 4—including Plaintiff Luis Sanabria (the “Racial Gerrymander Plaintiff”)—by\ntheirrace.\nD. TheProposed Congressional Plan Is Gerrymandered toDisproportionately Favor\nDemocraticCandidates\n69. The Proposed Congressional Plan also engages in impermissible partisan\ngerrymanderingthat dilutes the abilityof Republican voters in Illinois to elect candidates of their\nchoice.\n16\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 17 of 40 PageID #:17\n70. Illinois is relatively evenly divided between Republican and Democratic voters.\nFrom 1999 to 2005 and again from 2011 to the present, Illinois has been represented in the\nUnited States Senate by one Republican and one Democratic senator. Republicans held the\noffice of Governor of Illinois from 1977 to 2003, and Democrats have held it from 2003 to the\npresent. In the 2010 Illinois United States Senate race, Republican Candidate Mark Kirk\nreceived 48.01% of the vote, while Democratic Candidate Alexi Giannoulias received 46.42%.\nSimilarly, in the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, Democratic Candidate Pat Quinn received\n46.79%ofthevote,whileRepublican Bill Bradyreceived45.94%.\n71. The Illinois congressional delegation has been similarly divided between\nRepublicans and Democrats. Following the 2002 elections, there were 10 Republican and 9\nDemocratic Congressmen from Illinois. In 2004, 9 Republican and 10 Democratic Congressmen\nwere elected. In 2006, 8 Republican and 11 Democratic Congressmen were elected. In 2008, 7\nRepublicanand12DemocraticCongressmen were elected.\n72. In 2010, voters rejected four Democratic incumbents in favor of Republican\nchallengers and elected a Republican candidate to the seat vacated as a result of Republican\nCongressman Mark Kirk’s decision to run for United States Senate, resulting in a delegation of\n11Republicanand8DemocraticCongressmen.\n73. Despite the 2010 Congressional election results and the relativelyeven division of\nvoters between parties in Illinois, the Proposed Congressional Plan creates a situation in which\nthe Illinois Congressional delegation is likely to go from its current composition of 11\nRepublicans and8Democrats toonly6Republicans and12Democrats.\n74. The Proposed Congressional Plan accomplishes that result by packing traditional\nRepublican voters statewide into a relatively small number of proposed districts and then\n17\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 18 of 40 PageID #:18\ndividing the remaining Republican voters into districts that include reliable majorities of\nDemocraticvoters.\n75. While the entire Proposed Congressional Plan reflects a statewide partisan\ngerrymander, proposed Districts 3 and 11 are especially blatant examples of partisan\ngerrymandering. Those two districts were created to dilute Republican voters by dismantling\ncurrent District 13, represented by seven-term, Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert, the\nonlywoman in the current Republican congressional delegation. Current District 13 is located in\nsouthern DuPage, Northern Will, and Southwestern Cook Counties and encompasses a number\nof western and southwestern suburbs of Chicago such as Bolingbrook, Naperville, Orland Park,\nDowners Grove,Westmont,andWoodridge.\n76. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the Republican candidate received\n53.66%ofthevoteincurrent District 13,whiletheDemocraticcandidatereceived38.49%.\n77. The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally slices current District 13 into six\nproposed Districts (proposed Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 11, and 14) in order to dilute the influence of\nRepublicanvoters.\n78. The Proposed Congressional Plan first packs Republican enclaves in Naperville\nand Downers Grove into proposed Districts 6 and 14, resulting in new districts whose electorate\nis overwhelminglyRepublican.\n79. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 6\nvoted57.79%fortheRepublicancandidateand34.59%fortheDemocraticcandidate.\n80. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 14\nvoted57.19%fortheRepublicancandidateand32.91%forDemocratic candidate.\n18\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 19 of 40 PageID #:19\n81. Bypacking Republican voters into proposed Districts 6 and 14, the drafters of the\nProposed Congressional Plan were able to create a new, snake-shaped proposed District 11\ncentered around Aurora, Bolingbrook, and Joliet that combines just enough Democratic enclaves\nin those communities to give the proposed district a likely majority of Democratic voters,\ndilutingthevotes ofRepublicanvoters capturedintheconnectingsegments.\n82. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 11\nvoted 46.02% for the Republican candidate and 44.86% for the Democratic candidate. However,\nin the 2008 Presidential election, the electorate of proposed District 11 voted 61.10% for the\nDemocratic candidate and 37.01% for the Republican candidate. Similarly, in the 2006 Illinois\ngubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 11 voted 46.82% for the Democratic\ncandidate and 40.16% for the Republican candidate. Finally, in the 2004 Presidential election\ntheelectorateofproposedDistrict 11voted49.94%forthe Democraticcandidateand48.42% for\nthe Republican candidate. On average, Democratic candidates in these elections received 6.66%\nmorevotes in proposed District 11thanin current District 13,while theRepublican candidates in\nthese elections received 7.29% fewer votes, for a total average vote swing of 13.96% in favor of\ntheDemocraticcandidates.\n83. Similarly, proposed District 3 combines just enough suburban neighborhoods\nfrom current District 13 with southwestern Chicago neighborhoods to create another\ngerrymandered, Democratic majority district. Once again, the votes of Republican voters are\ndilutedas aresult.\n84. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 3\nvoted43.16%fortheRepublicancandidateand47.02%fortheDemocraticcandidate.\n19\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 20 of 40 PageID #:20\n85. Finally, proposed District 5 starts at the shores of Lake Michigan on the northside\nof Chicago, stretches west to O’Hare Airport, and then swings south around proposed District 4\nto just capture Congresswoman Biggert’s suburban Hinsdale home. Proposed District 5 has a\nDemocraticmajorityas well as aDemocraticincumbent,MikeQuigley.\n86. In the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the electorate of proposed District 5\nvoted36.17%fortheRepublicancandidateand54.18%fortheDemocraticcandidate.\n87. Further evidencing its partisan animus, the Proposed Congressional Plan draws\nsome Republican incumbents into the same districts, forcing them to run against each other or\nmove, while it also places Republican incumbents in Democratic-leaning districts with\nDemocraticincumbents.\n88. The Proposed Congressional Plan places incumbent Republican Congressmen Joe\nWalsh and RandyHultgren in proposed District 14, forcing them to run against each other in the\nRepublicanprimaryormove.\n89. The Proposed Congressional Plan does not place a single Democratic incumbent\ninthesameCongressional district as anotherDemocraticincumbent.\n90. The Proposed Congressional Plan places incumbent Republican Congressman\nAdam Kinzinger and incumbent Democratic Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. in proposed District\n2. Proposed District 2 is significantly weighted in favor of a Democratic candidate. Proposed\nDistrict 2 contains 78% of Congressman Jackson’s current district. Also, in the 2010 Illinois\ngubernatorial election, proposed District 2 voted 70.76% in favor of the Democratic candidate\nand only 20.50% in favor of the Republican candidate. In the 2008 and 2004 Presidential\nelections, it voted 80.64% and 73.56% in favor of the Democratic candidate and only 17.57%\nand24.17%infavoroftheRepublicancandidate.\n20\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 21 of 40 PageID #:21\n91. As already noted, the Proposed Congressional Plan places incumbent Republican\nCongresswoman Judy Biggert and incumbent Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley in\nproposed District 5. Proposed District 5 is significantly weighted in favor of a Democratic\ncandidate. ProposedDistrict 5contains 72%ofCongressmanQuigley’s current district. Also, in\nthe 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, it voted 54.18% in favor of the Democratic candidate\nand only 36.17% in favor of the Republican candidate. In the 2008 and 2004 Presidential\nelections, it voted 68.62% and 62.59% in favor of the Democratic Candidate and only 28.89%\nand35.22%infavoroftheRepublicancandidate.\n92. The Proposed Congressional Plan places incumbent Republican Congressman\nBob Dold and incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky in proposed District 9.\nProposed District 9 is significantly weighted in favor of a Democratic candidate. Proposed\nDistrict 9 contains 77% of Congresswoman Schakowsky’s current district. Also, in the 2010\nIllinois gubernatorial election, it voted 55.30% in favor of the Democratic candidate and only\n36.68% in favor of the Republican candidate. In the 2008 and 2004 Presidential elections, it\nvoted 67.74% and 62.63% in favor of the Democratic Candidate and only30.17% and 35.03% in\nfavoroftheRepublicancandidate.\n93. The Proposed Congressional Plan also favors Democratic incumbents in terms of\noverlap of population between current and proposed congressional districts. The Proposed\nCongressional Plan places Republican incumbents in districts whose population overlaps with an\naverageof34.20%oftheircurrent districts.\n94. By contrast, the Proposed Congressional Plan places Democratic incumbents in\ndistricts whosepopulationoverlaps withanaverageof77.52%oftheircurrent districts.\n21\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/27/11 Page 22 of 40 PageID #:22\n95. The population overlaps for Democratic incumbents range from a high of 93.49%\n(proposed District 12) to a low of 69.38% (proposed District 4). The highest Republican\nincumbent’s populationoverlapis only63.38%(proposedDistrict 18),whilethelowest is amere\n1.43%(proposedDistrict 5).\n96. TheProposedCongressional Planalso unnecessarilysplits asignificant numberof\nprominent and populous communities, including Bloomington, Champaign, DeKalb, Peoria,\nRockford, and Urbana, into multiple congressional districts, reducing the ability of these\ncommunities to select representatives of their choice. It also divides significant Chicago suburbs\n(with populations greater than 25,000 people) including Algonquin, Carol Stream,\nCarpentersville, Cicero, Crystal Lake, Glen Ellyn, Glendale Heights, Glenview, Gurnee,\nHanover Park, Lake in the Hills, Melrose Park, Mundelein, Oswego, Streamwood, Waukegan,\nWheaton,andWoodridge,as well as Chicago’s Chinatownneighborhood.\n97. The Proposed Congressional Plan is less compact than the present congressional\nmap.\n98. The present congressional map has a Circularity Ratio of 0.19. The Proposed\nCongressional Planhas a CircularityRatioof0.16.\n99. The present congressional map has a ratio of the circumference of an equal area\ncircle divided by the perimeter of the proposed districts of 0.45.

TheStateBoard of Elections Is ResponsibleForAdministeringElections in Illinois\n102. The Illinois State Board of Elections has “general supervision over the\nadministration of the registration and election laws throughout the State,” Ill. Const. 1970,art.

The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally discriminates against Latino\nvoters on the basis of their race. The Plan intentionally dilutes the votes of Latino voters by\npacking an excessive super-majority of Latino voters into proposed District 4 and by\nsimultaneously reducing the growing percentage of Latino voters in proposed Districts 3 and 5.\nMany Latino voters in proposed District 4 will see their votes wasted because the Plan\nintentionally makes those votes unnecessary to elect a candidate of their choice.

Count IV is brought by the Racial Gerrymander Plaintiff against the Individual\nBoardMemberDefendants intheirofficial capacities.\n125. The Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally made race—namely, Latino\nethnicity—the predominant factor in the creation of proposed District 4. That proposed District\ndisregards traditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for\npolitical subdivisions. Instead, it manufactures a Latino voting age supermajority of 65.92% by\npackingLatinoresidents intoanearmuff-shapeddistrict so bizarreonits facethat raceis the only\nexplanationfortheshape anddemographic compositionoftheDistrict.\n126. Proposed District 4 is not narrowlytailored to serve an interest in complying with\nthe Voting Rights Act because it includes far more Latino voters than would be necessary to\ncomplywiththat law and a Latinomajoritydistrict canbedrawnwithout racial gerrymandering.\n127. As a result, proposed District 4 impermissibly classifies the Racial Gerrymander\nPlaintiffbyhis race\n128. Accordingly, District 4 of the Proposed Congressional Plan violates the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made\nactionableinthis suit by42U.S.C.§1983.\nCOUNT V\n(Violation of theFirstAmendment,actionableunder42U.S.C.§1983,againstthe\nIndividualBoard MemberDefendants broughtbythePartisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs)\n129.

As a result, the Proposed Congressional Plan burdens and penalizes the Partisan\nGerrymander Plaintiffs’ exercise of their freedom of association, their right to express political\nviews, andtheirright to petitionthegovernment forredress of grievances.\n133. Accordingly, the Proposed Congressional Plan violates the First Amendment to\ntheUnitedStates Constitution,madeactionablein this suit by42U.S.C.§ 1983.\nCOUNT VI\n(Violation of theEqualProtection Clause,actionableunder42U.S.C.§1983,againstthe\nIndividualBoard MemberDefendants broughtbythePartisan Gerrymander Plaintiffs)\n134.

As a result, the Proposed Congressional Plan intentionally treats the Partisan\nGerrymander Plaintiffs differently and worse than it treats similarly situated voters who are\nDemocrats.

Insupportofthis motion,Plaintiffsstate:\nINTRODUCTION\n1. Plaintiffs have served Respondents with subpoenas seeking the production of\ndocuments relating to the formulation of the 2011 Illinois Congressional reapportionment plan\n(“Proposed Congressional Plan”) enacted as Illinois P.A. 97-14.1 As set forth in the Complaint,\nPlaintiffs allege that the Proposed Congressional Plan is an illegal gerrymander, motivated by\nracial and partisan bias. Plaintiffs expect that the sought-after discovery will expose the\nunlawfulmotivations for thePlan.\n2. Respondents have refused to comply with the Subpoenas. Instead, Respondents\nhave incorrectly asserted that they are categorically immune from discovery because of their\nstatus as state legislative bodies and employees thereof. Legislators enjoy no absolute privilege\nagainst third-party discovery. In this instance, any privilege possessed by legislators must yield\nto the interests of disclosure. Preventing Plaintiffs from taking the modest discovery will\nseverely impair Plaintiffs’ ability to vindicate their federally-protected constitutional and\nstatutoryrights.\nBACKGROUND\n3. The Subpoenas served on Respondents each consisted of twenty-one requests for\nproduction seeking documents related to: (a) the 2010-2011 Illinois Congressional redistricting\nprocess and the planning, development, negotiation, drawing, revision, or re-drawing of the\n1 The individual Respondents are legislative staffers identified as being involved in the redistricting\nprocess. Certain of the Subpoenas were served in the Central District of Illinois. However, counsel for\nRespondents have agreed to consent to the jurisdiction of this Court for purposes of determining the\nenforceability of the Subpoenas against all Respondents, whether they reside in this district or in the\nCentral District of Illinois, without waivingtheir otherobjections. Exhibit A contains the cover pages of\nallSubpoenas,butbecausetheridersarevoluminousandidentical,Plaintiffsonlyattachonecopy.\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 3 of 18 PageID #:264\nProposed Congressional Plan; (b) election and voter data as well as software used to plan and\ndraw the Proposed Congressional Plan, its respective districts, or anyother potential redistricting\nplan that was not ultimately adopted; (c) expert or consultant reports or any other analyses\nregarding the Proposed Congressional Plan; and (d) the posting of the Proposed Congressional\nPlanontheIllinoisSenatewebsiteon May27,2011.2\n4. Plaintiffs and Respondents conferred by phone and e-mail on numerous\noccasions, but were unable to reach an agreement concerning the Subpoenas. See Statement of\nCompliancewith Fed.R. Civ.P.37(a)(1)andN.D.Ill. LocalRule37.2,attached asExhibitB.\n5. On September 2, 2011, Respondents sent counsel for Plaintiffs a letter detailing\ntheir objections to the Subpoenas. As stated in Respondents’ letter and confirmed in a\nconferencecallon September 6, 2011, Respondents’position is that each ofthe requests madein\nthe Subpoenas seek “documents or communications that are protected by legislative immunity,\nthe deliberative process privilege, the attorney-client privilege, and/or the work product\ndoctrine.” Respondents stated that “[t]he only non-privileged documents in the possession of\n[Respondents] that are responsive to [the Subpoenas] are publicly available documents that were\npreviously provided to one of your associates pursuant to [a previously completed] Freedom of\nInformation Act” request. See Letter of September 2, 2011, attached as Exhibit C, passim.\nFurther, Respondents’ stated position is that the doctrine of legislative immunity also protects\nthemfromtheburdenofpreparingaprivilegelogtosetforththeirassertionsofprivilege.\n6. In addition, Respondents object that each of the requests is “overly broad, and\nunduly burdensome.” Id. Counsel indicated orally that given their purported absolute immunity\n2 Plaintiffs understand that the House Respondents are represented by David Ellis (Counsel to the\nSpeaker), and the Senate Respondents by Eric M. Madiar (Chief Legal Counsel to the President of the\nSenate). Michael Layden of the law firm Richard J. Prendergast, Ltd. is also involved, but the scope of\nhisrepresentationisunclear. AllRespondentsobjectedtotheSubpoenascollectively.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 4 of 18 PageID #:265\nfrom discovery, Respondents need not assess whether or to what extent they may have\ndocuments which are responsive to the Subpoenas. They further object that certain requests are\n“notreasonablycalculatedtoleadtothediscoveryofadmissibleevidence.” id.¶¶1,2.3\nARGUMENT\nI. Documents inRespondents’PossessionAreHighlyRelevantto Plaintiffs’Case\n7. Respondents have not denied—nor can they—that the information sought in the\nSubpoenas is highly relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims. It is undisputed that Respondents were\nresponsible for drawing at least part of the 2011 Congressional reapportionment plan that is now\nat issue in this matter. Therefore, obtaining specific information about the process by which the\nactual drafters of the Plan drew various districts is an essential element of proof in Plaintiffs’\ncase. For example, in order to succeed on their claim that the Proposed Congressional Plan is an\nunlawful racial gerrymander that violates the Equal Protection Clause, Plaintiffs must show that\n“race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant\nnumber of voters within or without a particular district.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916\n(1995). Documents relating to the formulation of the Plan are directly relevant to establishing\nthatitwasadoptedfor adiscriminatoryreason.\n8. Indeed, several courts have recognized that “evidence concerning the intent with\nwhich the [redistricting body] adopted the plan and rejected certain alternatives,” is highly-\nrelevant and may be developed through discovery against legislators. United States v. Irvin, 127\nF.R.D.169,171-173(C.D.Cal.1989)(grantingrequestbyplaintiffsinVotingRightsActcaseto\nconduct discovery on legislators who had passed allegedlydiscriminatory redistricting plan); see\nalso Rodriguez v. Pataki, 280 F. Supp. 2d 89, 102 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (allowing discovery on\n3 Plaintiffs and Respondents were able to resolve Respondents’ objections pertaining to confusion in the\ndefinitionoftheterm“VAP”or“VotingAgePopulation.” Seeid.at¶¶9,10,11.\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 5 of 18 PageID #:266\nlegislators and noting that “[w]hile evidence of discriminatory animus may not be an essential\nelement of all of the plaintiffs’ claims, it certainly is something that can be considered in\ndeciding whether the New York Legislature’s 2002 redistricting plans pass judicial muster”).\nC.f. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,429 U.S. 252, 268 (1977)\n(“contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, [and] minutes of its\nmeetings or reports” may be “highly relevant” in “determining whether racially discriminatory\nintentexisted”).\nII. “Legislative Privilege” Does Not Excuse Respondents’ Compliance with the\nSubpoenas\n9. State legislators enjoy “absolute legislative immunity” from civil suit for “all\nactions taken in ‘the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.’” Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S.\n44, 54 (1998) (quotingTenney v. Brandhove,341 U.S. 367, 372 (1951)).4 But that immunity\ndoes not protect legislators from third-party discovery. Instead, state legislators possess only a\n“legislative privilege” against such discovery. That privilege is “qualified,” not absolute, and\nmay be overcome by a sufficient showing of need. Pataki, 280 F.

The factors that a court should consider in deciding whether the legislative\nprivilege may be invoked are: “‘(i) the relevance of the evidence sought to be protected; (ii) the\navailability of other evidence; (iii) the seriousness of the litigation and the issues involved; (iv)\nthe role of the government in the litigation; and (v) the possibility of future timidity by\ngovernment employees who will be forced to recognize that their secrets are violable.’” Pataki,\n280 F. Supp. 2d at 100-01 (quoting In re Franklin Nat’l Bank Sec., 478 F. Supp. 577, 583\n(E.D.N.Y. 1979)). Additional relevant factors are “[t]he presence of issues concerning alleged\ngovernmental misconduct,” Irvin, 127 F.R.D. at 173 (collecting cases); “[t]he role of the\ngovernment in the litigation itself,” id. (citing In re Franklin); and importantly, “[t]he federal\ninterest in the enforcement of federal law,” id. (collecting cases). Further, a court must consider\nthepurposesthattheprivilegeserves. UnitedStates v.Gillock,445U.S.360,370(1980).\n11. When considering the relevant factors and purposes, moreover, a court should be\nguided by the fact that testimonial privileges are disfavored because they “contravene the\nfundamental principle that ‘the public ... has the right to every man’s evidence.’” Trammel v.\nUnited States,445 U.S.40,50 (1980)(quotingUnited States v.

Particularly when viewed with the appropriate\nskepticism of privilege claims, all of the relevant factors and considerations weigh in favor of\npermittingdiscovery.\n12. The factor most relevant to the instant analysis is the nature of the federal interest\natstakeinthis lawsuit, and howallowingRespondents to ignorethe Subpoenas would affect that\ninterest. The Gillock case involveda Tennessee legislator indicted on bribery charges who\nargued that legislative privilege prohibited the introduction of any evidence at his federal\ncriminal trial concerning his legislative acts and the motivations underlying them. 445 U.S.at\n366. While the Court expressed “sensitivity to interference with the functioning of state\nlegislators,” it ultimately decided to pierce the privilege, holding that “where important federal\ninterests are at stake, as in the enforcementof federal criminal statutes, comity yields.” Id. at\n373. Considering the balance between state legislative independence and the furtherance of\nimportant federal interests, the justification for piercing the legislative privilege is even stronger\nherethanitwas inGillock.\n13. Here, the “federal interest” at stake is the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act\n(“VRA”) and similar constitutional rights protecting enfranchisement. That interest is obviously\nof vital importance. See Irvin, 127 F.R.D. at 174 (concluding piercing of legislative privilege\nwarranted in part because “[t]he federal interest in” enforcing the VRA “is compelling”).\nIndeed, because the very purpose of the VRA is to act as check on unlawful actions by state\nlegislators, absolute deference to state legislative prerogatives, which is what Respondents ask,\nwould be exceptionally inappropriate in this circumstance. See Derrickson v. City of Danville,\nIll., 845 F.2d 715, 724 (7th Cir. 1988) (Cudahy, J. concurring) (the Voting Rights Act was\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 8 of 18 PageID #:269\npassed because “states could not be relied upon to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth and\nfifteenth amendments”). The Supreme Court has recognized that in order to accomplish the\nVRA’s goals of “prevent[ing] discrimination in the exercise of the electoral franchise and\n[]foster[ing] our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race,” Georgia v.\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 490 (2003), a measure of “federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state\nand local policymaking” is required. Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U.S. 266, 282 (1999); see\nalso Dickinson v. Indiana State Election Bd., 933 F.2d 497, 502 (7th Cir. 1991) (because the\n“supremacy clause ensures that the Voting Rights Act takes precedence over illegal state\napportionments,” concern over federalism or deference to state lawmakers “provides no basis”\nfor refusing to enforce the Act). To permit Respondents to hide behind the privilege here would\nallow Respondents to use their status as legislators to shield the very behavior that the VRA was\ndesignedtopolice.\n14. In a similar vein, the Subpoenas do not seek information ancillary to the central\nissues ofthis lawsuit;rathertheyseek information about theintent, purposes, and methods ofthe\nredistrictingprocess that go to the core of the action. Indeed, disclosureis especiallyappropriate\nbecause “the subject matter of this case, as defined by federal law, is in part the legislative\nprocess itself.” Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Facs., 164 F.R.D. at 268 (compelling legislative staffers to\nattend depositions despite assertions of legislative privilege). In this regard, this case is similar\nto United States v. Bd. of Educ. Of City of Chicago, 610 F. Supp. 695, 700 (N.D. Ill. 1985),\nwherethisCourt,inanalyzingthesimilardeliberativeprocessprivilege,stated:\nClearly, then, this is not the usual “deliberative process” case in which a private\nparty challenges governmental action or seeks documents via the Freedom of\nInformation Act, and the government tries to prevent its decisionmaking process\nfrom being swept up unnecessarily into public. Here the decisionmaking process\nis not ‘swept up into’ the case, it is the case. The issue is the deliberative process\n* * * Thus, the [government’s] assertion of the privilege, if sustained, could have\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 9 of 18 PageID #:270\ntheharmfuleffectofpreventingthisCourtfromfulfillingitsverymission ***\nId. (emphasis in original). The traditional justifications for state legislative privilege are at their\nlowestebbwhenitisthestatelegislativeprocessitselfthatischallenged.\n15. A final point about the federal interest at stake: Like the enforcement of federal\ncorruption laws (see Gillock, 445 U.S. at 373), enforcement of the VRA and associated\nconstitutional provisions is a federal interest with an undeniable public dimension. Courts are\nmore willingto disregard legislative privilege when the underlying lawsuit seeks to vindicate the\nfederally-protected rights of the public (as this suit does), as opposed to private interests of\nindividuals. See Newport Pacific Inc. v. County of San Diego, 200 F.R.D. 628, 640 (S.D. Cal.\n2001) (“This is not a typical deliberative process case in which a private party challenges a\ngovernmental action. Rather, this is an action alleging violations of federal constitutional\nmagnitude. The tendency is therefore to allow discovery.”); Kay, 2003 WL 25294710, at *19\n(notingthat while“[a]ll lawsuits areserious in theeyes oftheparties to anyof them,”piercingof\nprivilege would be more appropriate, for example, in a case alleging that the government\n“discriminated against residents’ voting rights on the basis of race” than in a slip-and-fall case\nbrought by an individual).7 The issues implicated in this lawsuit have an obviously far-reaching\npublic impact. And the discovery sought is no fishing expedition. As is evident from the\ndetailed facts pleaded in the Complaint, the allegations of government misconduct are both\nseriousandwell-founded.\n7 Compare Bagley v. Blagojevich, 646 F.2d 378 (7th Cir. 2011), which did not involve a compelling\npublic interest; rather it involved an attempt bya group of Illinois Department of Corrections workers to\ncompel Governor Blagojevich (who was acting in a legislative capacity) to submit to a deposition to\nascertain his motive for eliminating their positions. But see Manzi, 982 F. Supp. at 130 (ordering that\ndocuments concerning allocations of funds to a state senator be produced in an employment termination\ncase because “the discovery and trial needs of plaintiff in enforcing her rights under federal law clearly\noutweightheStateDefendants’needforconfidentiality.”).\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 10 of 18 PageID #:271\n16. The other relevant considerations militate in favor of enforcement of the\nSubpoenas. Forthereasons explained above, thesought-afterinformation is highlyrelevant. No\nother party would possess similarly direct or probative evidence of the invidious motivations\nbehind the Plan. And the State Board of Elections, which is an arm of the state government and\nis beingdefendedbythestateAttorneyGeneral’s office,is aDefendanthere.\n17. Allowing discovery will not unduly chill legislators in their future\ncommunications. Respondents here are not defendants in this suit. Plaintiffs seek no monetary\nor injunctive relief against them. The court in In re Grand Jury considered the “threat of\nintimidation” that might result from the risk that any discovered material might be used against\nthe legislator in a later criminal prosecution. 821 F.2d at 956. There appears to be no danger of\nthat occurring here. See also Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Facs., 164 F.R.D. at 266. In Gillock, the\nSupreme Court characterized the impact of disclosure on state legislators’ future deliberations as\n“speculative” and “minimal.” Gillock, 445 U.S. at 373. And because this case involves\nredistricting—a task not oft performed by legislators—permitting discovery will not work to\nchill the day-to-day functioning of the legislature. The Court should follow Irvin in concluding\nthat ordering disclosure will not “add measurably to the inhibitions already attending legislative\ndeliberations.” Irvin,127 F.R.D.174.\n18. Even if the Court were to decide that Respondents were entitled to the legislative\nprivilege for some of the documents in their possession, the privilege would not entirely relieve\nthem of the burden of complying with the Subpoenas. First, to the extent that the Court\ndetermines that Respondents may assert the legislative privilege to protect inquiry into their\nprivate deliberations, Plaintiffs would still be entitled to the materials and information available\nto the Respondents at the time a decision was made. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at n.20\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 11 of 18 PageID #:272\n(noting that plaintiffs “were allowed, both during the discovery phase and at trial, to question\nBoard members fullyabout materials and information availableto them at thetimeof decision”);\nsee also ACORN v. County of Nassau, 2009 WL 2923435, No. 05-CV-2301, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.\nSept. 10, 2009) (“[E]ven where the legislative privilege bars questioning or production of\ndocuments revealing a legislator’s deliberations, it does not also prohibit inquiries into\ndocuments and information available to the legislators at the time the decision was made.”)\n(citing Arlington Heights). Much of what the Subpoenas call for is this sort of objective\ninformation. See,e.g.,Subpoenasat¶4 (callingforvoter/electiondata).\n19. Furthermore, for a substantial portion of the requested documents, any privilege\nthat Respondents might have properly asserted has been waived through communications with\nparties outside of the General Assembly. “As with many testimonial privileges, the legislative\nprivilege may be waived as to communications made in the presence of third parties.” ACORN\nv. County of Nassau, 2007 WL 2815810, No. CV 05-2301, (E.D.N.Y. Sep. 25, 2007) (citing\nAlmonte v. City of Long Beach, 2005 WL 1971014, No. CV 04-4192, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 16,\n2005) (consultations with political operative were not part of the legislative process and thus not\nprivileged). Legislators are not “entitled to discuss [the legislative process] with some outsiders\nthen later invoke the privilege as to others.” Almonte, 2005 WL1796118, at *3; see also Pataki,\n280 F. Supp. 2d at 101 (“no one could seriously claim [legislative] privilege” to “a conversation\nbetween legislators and knowledgeable outsiders, such as lobbyists, to mark up legislation.”).\nOn multiple occasions in 2011, Democratic Members of Congress met and exchanged\ninformation with Democratic members of the Illinois General Assembly concerning the\ncongressional remap.8 Any information exchanged at those or similar meetings is discoverable.\n8 For example, Democratic Members of Congress met with Springfield staffers on Saturday, May 21 to\nsee drafts of their districts. See Capitolfax.com Newsletter, posted May 20, 2011, available at\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 12 of 18 PageID #:273\nIn addition, on information and belief, employees and/or agents of the national Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”) actually drew most or part of the Proposed\nCongressional Plan that is the current law of Illinois.9 Certainly, Plaintiffs are entitled to seek\ndocumentsandotherwiseinquireintoRespondents’contactwiththesethirdparties.\n20. If the Court nonetheless concludes that legislative privilege applies to the\nSubpoenas, theCourt undertake an in camera reviewof the privileged documents to determine if\nanyshouldbe divulged. SeeACORN,2009 WL2923435,at*5 (holdingthatitwouldperformin\ncamera review on documents subject to legislative privilege and would compel production of\nany documents that “reveal[ed] that racial considerations played any role in the legislative\ndeliberations regarding the * * * decision.”); Pataki, 2003 WL 22109902, at 2 (employing same\nprocedure). Counsel for Respondents admitted that there are potentially “thousands” of\ndocuments in Respondents’ possession that are responsiveto theSubpoenas,although apparently\nno efforts had, as of September 6, 2011, been made to quantify such documents. Plaintiffs\nshould not be deprived of those potentially crucial documents on Respondents’ mere, blanket\nassertionofthelegislativeprivilege.\n21. Finally, in the event that the Court determines that Respondents are entitled to\nassert the legislative privilege, Defendants should not be permitted to offer evidence from\nRespondents in defense of this matter. For example, to allow Defendants to call a representative\nof the Illinois House to testify at the injunction hearing about the motives of the Proposed\nCongressional Plan, after the Illinois House had previously asserted legislative privilege to\nhttp://capitolfax.com/2011/05/20/this-just-in-official-map-finally-posted/; see also Kristen McQuery,\nIncumbents Carve Out a New Congressional Map, THE NEW YORK TIMES, June 2, 2011, available at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/us/03cncredistricting.html (“Members of Congress were invited to\nview the map in Springfield two weeks ago, before the measure was released publicly.

See Robinson v. Morgan Stanley,\n2010 WL 1050288 No. 06 C 5158, at *6 (N.D. Ill. March 17, 2010) (quoting United States v.\nBilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (1992) (“[a] defendant may not use the privilege to prejudice his\nopponent’s caseortodisclosesomeselectedcommunications forself-servingpurposes”)).\nIII. RespondentsHaveNotProperlyAssertedthe“DeliberativeProcess Privilege”\n22. “The deliberative-process privilege covers memoranda and discussions within the\nExecutive Branch leading up to the formulation of an official position.” United States v.\nZingsheim, 384 F.3d 867, 872 (7th Cir. 2004). As should be clear from the preceding quote,\nthere is no reason to think that the “deliberative process privilege” may be asserted by\nRespondents, as it is a prerogative of the executive/administrative branch of government. See\nKay, 2003 WL 25294710, at *15 (quoting A Michael’s Piano, Inc. v. FTC, 18 F.3d 138, 147 (2d\nCir.1994).\n23. Even assuming that Respondents could assert the deliberative process privilege,\nthey have failed to properly do so. As this Court has recently written, assertion of the\ndeliberative process privilege must be done on a document-by-document basis, with the\ngovernmentdescribingwithparticularitywhyeachfitsinthenarrowconfinesoftheprivilege:\nIn order to invoke the privilege, a party must show three elements: (1) the\ndepartment head with control over the information has made a formal claim of\nprivilege; (2) the responsible official must demonstrate, usually by affidavit, the\nreasons for preserving the confidentiality of the documents; and, (3) the official\nmust specifically identify and describe the documents in question. Ferrell v.\nUnited States Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev., 177 F.R.D. 425, 428 (N.D. Ill.\n1998)(internalquoteand citationomitted).\nBuonauro v.

In addition, the deliberative process privilege only protects a communication if it\nis pre-decisional in the sense that it is “actually [a]ntecedent to the adoption of an agency\npolicy,” and deliberative in the sense that it is “actually ... related to the process by which\npolicies are formulated.” Enviro Tech Int’l v. Envt’l Prot. Agency, 371 F.3d 370, 375 (7th Cir.\n2004). The privilege does not justify the withholding of “purely factual material” or documents\nreflecting an agency’s final policydecisions. Id. at 374; see also Tumas v. Bd. of Educ. of Lyons\nTp.HighSchoolDist.No.204,2007 WL2228695,No.06C1943, at*1 (N.D. Ill.July31,2007)\n(“the privilege * * * does not protect purely factual material”) (citations omitted). Without a\ndetailed description of the responsive documents Respondents are withholding, Plaintiffs simply\ncannot know which (if any) responsive documents satisfy these conditions. Again, much of the\nSubpoenacallsfor factualmatter(suchasvoterdata)thatis notprotected.\n25. Further, Respondents have waived this privilege for any documents shared with\nthird-parties (such as the Illinois Congressional delegation and employees or agents of the\nDCCC). Howard v. City of Chicago, 2006 WL 2331096, No. 03 C 8481, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Aug.\n10, 2006) (privileges relating to governmental decisionmaking can be waived if the disclosure is\nvoluntarilymadetooutsideparty).\n26. Even if the privilege were properly asserted and did apply, the deliberative\nprocess privilege, like the legislative privilege, is a not absolute and “may be overcome where\nthereis asufficient showingof aparticularized need tooutweigh thereasons forconfidentiality.”\nUnited States v. Farley, 11 F.3d 1385, 1389 (7th Cir. 1993).11 For the reasons discussed above,\nprivilege is a blanket claim, unsupported by the type of affidavit described above * * * we must take\nadimviewofitsclaimevenatthethresholdlevel.”).\n11“[T]thebalancingteststhatcourtshavesuggestedforchallengestoboththelegislativeprivilegeandthe\ndeliberative process privilege are quite similar and functionally interchangeable.” Kay, 2003 WL\n25294710, at *17; see also K.L. v.

Ill. 1997) (listing factors for\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 15 of 18 PageID #:276\napplicationofthedeliberativeprocessprivilegeisinappropriateinthiscase.\nIV. Respondents’ Objections Based on Attorney-Client Privilege, Work Product\nPrivilege,andOverbreadthandBurdenFail\n27. During the final call, Respondents’ counsel indicated that they had treated their\nassertions of the legislative and deliberative process privileges essentiallyas “threshold” matters,\nand had therefore not gone to the trouble to analyze particular documents for claims of attorney-\nclient or work-product protection. Obviously “[a] blanket claim of privilege that does not\nspecify what information is protected will not suffice.” United States v. White, 970 F.2d 328,\n334(7thCir.1992)(“privilege mustbe madeand sustainedonadocument-by-documentbasis”).\n28. Similarly, on the call, Respondents indicated that they had not attempted to\nascertain how many potentially responsive documents are in their possession. This failure\nrenders their claims of over-breadth and burdensomeness meritless. Respondents have further\nobjected that Plaintiffs’ first two requests are “not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery\nof admissible evidence.” A quick read of the requests is enough to refute that argument.\nPlaintiffs’ requests for discovery are narrowly tailored to seek documents relating to the\nformulation of the Proposed Congressional Plan—the central issue in this case. Apart from the\nstatements in their letter, Respondents have not explained why the first two requests are not\n“reasonably calculated” to lead to admissible evidence. They have therefore failed to shoulder\ntheir burden to “show why a discovery request is improper.” Rubin v. Islamic Republic of\nIran,349 F.Supp.2d1108,1111(N.D.Ill.2004).12\nweighing deliberative process privilege). The privilege “must be strictly confined within the narrowest\npossiblelimitsconsistentwiththelogicofitsprinciples.” Id.at1208.\n12 Finally, Respondents also object that the applicable local and federal rules “do not require [them] to\nproduce software programs.” Id. at ¶¶ 4, 6. Plaintiffs do not require Respondents’ to produce copies of\nthe election Redistricting software that they used. However, Respondents’ are required to produce the\ndatafilescalledforinrequests¶¶4-5,andtoidentifywhichsoftwareprogramswereusedtocreatethem.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 52 Filed: 09/15/11 Page 16 of 18 PageID #:277\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, the Court should order Respondents to comply\nwiththeSubponeas within7days.\nRespectfullySubmitted,\nDated: September15,2011 By: LoriE.Lightfoot\nTyroneC.

Nothingin the motion todismiss requires that anyof the\nwell-pleaded causesofactionintheComplaintbedismissed.\nThe Complaint alleges with significant factual detail that the congressional redistricting\nplan adopted by the State of Illinois is a product of intentional vote dilution of Latino voters in\nDistricts 3, 4, and 5, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (Count I), the Fourteenth\nAmendment (Count II), and the Fifteenth Amendment (Count III); that District 4 is an obvious\nracial gerrymander that is not narrowly tailored to accomplish a compelling state interest, in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count IV); and that the redistricting plan is a blatant\npartisan gerrymander against Republican voters, in violation of the First Amendment (Count V)\nand the Fourteenth Amendment (Count VI). Such serious and well-supported allegations—that\nthe State of Illinois effectively disenfranchised Latino and Republican voters—should not be\ndismissedonthreadbare argumentsbeforeallofthefacts haveevenbeen gathered.\nLEGALSTANDARD\nAlthough Defendants clearly pine for the bygone days of fact pleading, a complaint need\nonly contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.” Fed. R. Civ. P.8(a)(2). “Under the notice pleading standard, of course, a complaint need\nnot contain legal theories.” Aaron v. Mahl, 550 F.3d 659, 666 (7th Cir. 2008). Even after Iqbal\nand Twombly, “[c]omplaints need not do more than narrate a plausible claim for relief.”\nMorrison v. YTB Int’l, Inc., 649 F.3d 533, 2011 WL 3132398, at *5 (7th Cir. 2011). To be\nplausible, “the plaintiff must give enough details about the subject-matter of the case to present a\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 3 of 17 PageID #:623\nstory that holds together.” Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., 614 F.3d 400, 404 (7th Cir. 2010). It must\n“provide notice to defendants of [a plaintiff’s] claims,” and the Court “must accept a plaintiff’s\nfactualallegationsastrue.”Brooksv.Ross,578 F.3d574,581(7thCir.2009).\nARGUMENT\nI. The Complaint States Claims For Intentional Discrimination In Violation Of\nSection2 OfTheVotingRights Act,TheFourteenthAmendment,andTheFifteenth\nAmendment.\nThe Complaint alleges that Illinois’s redistricting plan is the product of intentional\ndiscrimination against Latinos aimed atdilutingtheir votes inDistricts 3, 4,and 5,in violation of\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act (Count I), the Fourteenth Amendment (Count II), and the\nFifteenth Amendment (Count III). Compl. ¶¶108-122. In the face of detailed factual allegations\nsupportingthoseclaims,Defendants advanceaseries ofmeritlessarguments fordismissal.\nA. A Section 2 Claim Of Intentionally Discriminatory Vote Dilution Need Not\nSatisfyThe Gingles Requirements.\nDefendants spend more than a quarter of their motion (at 2-5) explaining why Plaintiffs’\nSection 2 claim fails to satisfy requirements that do not apply to Plaintiffs’ claim. Defendants\nincorrectlyassumethat all claims under Section 2 oftheVotingRights Act must satisfythethree\n“Gingles requirements.” See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986) ((1) minority\ngroup is “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-\nmember district”; (2) minority group is “politically cohesive”; and (3) majority votes\n“sufficiently as a bloc to enable it ... usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate”).\nWhile Gingles governs Section 2 cases alleging discriminatory effects alone, it does not apply\nwhere,ashere,plaintiffs allegediscriminatoryintent.\nCourts around the country—including the Seventh Circuit—widely recognize that\nSection 2 of “the Voting Rights Act can be violated by both intentional discrimination in the\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 4 of 17 PageID #:624\ndrawing of district lines and facially neutral apportionment schemes that have the effect of\ndiluting minority votes.” Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 766 (9th Cir. 1990);\naccord Barnett v. City of Chicago, 141 F.3d 699, 701 (7th Cir. 1998) (intentionally\ndiscriminatory “plan would violate ... section 2 of the Voting Rights Act”); United States v.\nBrown, 561 F.3d 420 (5th Cir. 2009) (affirming finding of intentional discrimination in violation\nof Section 2). And the Supreme Court has been careful to distinguish intentional discrimination\nfrom other forms of vote dilution in applying the Gingles requirements, recognizing the\ncompelling reasons for not applying those requirements to intentional discrimination claims.\nBartlett v. Strickland, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1246 (2009) (notingview of United States that “evidence\nof discriminatory intent ‘tends to suggest that the jurisdiction is not providing an equal\nopportunitytominorityvoters’”evenwherecertain Ginglesfactors arenotpresent).\nThe Ninth Circuit has expressly held that the Gingles framework does not govern\nintentional discrimination cases. Garza, 918 F.2d at 769-71; id. at 778-79 (Kozinski, J.,\nconcurring). The Garza court explained that “[t]he Gingles requirements were articulated in a\nmuch different context.” Id. at 770. Imposingthe Gingles requirements on an intentional dilution\nclaim, the court reasoned, “would prevent any redress for districting which was deliberately\ndesigned to prevent minorities from electing representatives in future elections governed by that\ndistricting,” a result that is “wholly contrary to Congress’ intent in enacting Section 2 of the\nVotingRightsAct.”Id.at771.\nOther courts have likewise bypassed any consideration of the Gingles factors when faced\nwith Section 2 claims for intentionallydiscriminatory vote dilution. See Brown, 561 F.3d at 432-\n33; Dillard v. Baldwin County Bd. of Educ., 686 F. Supp. 1459, 1467-69 (M.D. Ala. 1988); see\nalso Baird v. Consol. City of Indianapolis, 976 F.2d 357, 360 (7th Cir. 1992) (even where\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 5 of 17 PageID #:625\nplaintiffs have not satisfied the effects test under Section 2, “proof of intentional discrimination\nunder§2(a)remainsan option”).\nNone of the cases on which Defendants rely (at 3-5) in arguing that Gingles governs are\nto the contrary. Each such decision addressed allegations of discriminatory effects, not\nintentional discrimination. Defendants’ citations are therefore inapt. See Garza, 918 F.2d at 771\n(distinguishing,amongothers, McNeilv.SpringfieldPark,851 F.2d937 (7thCir.1988)).\nIn short, anysupposed failure to plead a Gingles factor is not abasis to dismiss Plaintiffs’\nclaimofintentionaldiscriminationunder Section 2oftheVotingRightsAct.\nB. The Complaint Properly Alleges Intentional Discrimination In Violation Of\nSection2,TheFourteenthAmendment,AndTheFifteenthAmendment.\nDefendants also argue (at 5-7) that Counts I and II fail because Plaintiffs supposedly did\nnot “allege any facts to support their claim of intent to dilute” or “allege a single factor relevant\nto [the] totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.” Defendants must not have read Plaintiffs’\nComplaint,foritisrepletewithpreciselythosekinds ofallegations.\nAs Defendants recognize (at 6), proportionalityis a keyfactor in the totality analysis. See\nLeague of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 436 (2006) (“We proceed now to\nthe totality of the circumstances, and first to the proportionality inquiry”) (“LULAC”). The\nComplaint alleges that Latinos comprise 15.8% of Illinois’s population and 24.0% of Cook\nCounty’s population. Compl. ¶51. It further alleges that “[d]espite Illinois’s large and growing\nLatino population, the Proposed Congressional Plan contains only one majority Latino district,\nDistrict4,outoftheeighteendistrictscreated.” Id.¶52(i.e.,5.6%).1\n1 Defendants incredibly contend (at 6) that this disproportionality is not “favorable to\n[Plaintiffs’] claim” because vote dilution claims are “district-specific.” That argument makes no\nsense at all. For proportionality to mean anything, it must be broader than a “district-specific”\nconcept since each district only elects one representative. Indeed, the Supreme Court has\ninstructedlowercourtsto“lookatproportionalitystatewide.” LULAC,548U.S.at437.\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 6 of 17 PageID #:626\nIn addition, contraryto Defendants’baseless assertions (at 5),theComplaintpleads racial\npolarization in the electorate. See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 426 (listing “extent to which votingin the\nelections of the State or political subdivision is racially polarized” as a totality factor). The\nComplaint expressly alleges that “elections in Illinois have been racially and ethnically\npolarized” (Compl. ¶57), that “Latino voters traditionallyand consistentlyvotecohesivelyin the\nState of Illinois, particularly in Cook County” (id. ¶56), and that non-Latino voters “have often\nvoted sufficiently as blocks that, in the absence of special circumstances or a large Latino voter\npopulation,thepreferred candidatesofLatinovotershavebeendefeated”(id.¶57).\nThe Complaint addresses other totality factors as well. The Complaint references\n“judicial proceedings over redistricting” after “the 1990 census” (Compl. ¶60) in which this\nDistrict found a “history of discrimination against Chicago Hispanics in housing, education and\nservices, which the [Seventh Circuit] regarded as a cause of the historically low Hispanic voter\nregistrationandturnout.” Hastertv.StateBd.ofElections,777 F. Supp.634,650(N.D. Ill.1991)\n(citing Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398 (7th Cir. 1984)). The Hastert decision likewise\nrecognized the long history of federal courts throwing out unconstitutional redistricting plans in\nIllinois that discriminated against Latinos. See id. at 641, 650 (noting “judicially recognized\nhistory of discrimination, both past and recent, against the Chicago Hispanic community” and\n“politicallydiscriminatorypractices atboththestateandlocallevel”).\nFurthermore, the totality factors that Defendants list (at 5-6) are nonexclusive. Courts\nanalyzing intentional discrimination claims also routinely look to the factors set out in Village of\nArlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977). See\nBrown, 561 F.3d at 433; Garza, 918 F.2d at 771; see also Barnett v. Daley, 32 F.3d 1196, 1198-\n99 (7th Cir. 1994) (citing Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976)). Under Arlington Heights,\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 7 of 17 PageID #:627\n“[a]dditional circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent may include the impact of an\naction ‘bear[ing] more heavily on one race than another,’ ‘the historical background of the\ndecision,’ the ‘specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,’ ‘[d]epartures\nfrom the normal procedural sequence,’ and ‘statements by members of the decisionmaking\nbody.’”Brown,561 F.3d at433(quotingArlingtonHeights).\nThe Complaint is full of circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent. It describes\nhow the State packed District 4 with a 65.92% Latino voting age population (“VAP”), a\nmaterially greater number than the 59.18% Latino VAP found to be sufficient to allow Latino\nvoters to elect a candidate of choice in the predecessor district created after the 1990 census.\nCompl.¶¶52,60.At the sametime, theComplaint explains how theStatemateriallyreduced the\nLatino VAP in adjacent districts represented by white congressmen despite the growing Latino\npopulation in Illinois and Cook County. Id. ¶ 53 (new District 3 lowers Latino VAP from\n29.31%to24.64%); id.¶ 54(newDistrict5lowers LatinoVAPfrom24.56%to16.05%).\nThe Complaint also details the telling process by which the State adopted the\ncongressional redistricting plan. In public hearings on redistricting, the chairpersons of the state\nlegislature’s Redistricting Committees “controlled the conduct” of the hearings, forbade the\npublic from “ask[ing] questions of the members of the Redistricting Committees,” and presented\nno “draft or proposed congressional maps or redistricting plan for the public to consider.”\nCompl. ¶38. Chairman Raoul “pledged” “to release proposed maps at least one or two weeks\nbefore any vote would be taken” and then “reneged on that pledge.” Id. ¶39. Then the\nRedistrictingCommittees finallyreleased an initial version of the map at 4:00 a.m. on the Friday\nof Memorial Dayweekend and the Illinois legislature passed the congressional map within days,\nwhilethepublic’sattentionwasdivertedovertheholiday.Id. ¶¶41-45.\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 8 of 17 PageID #:628\nTaken together, these allegations are easily sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\nThey clearly offer “enough details” that are suggestive of intentionally discriminatory vote\ndilution“topresent astorythatholdstogether.” Swanson,614 F.3d at404.\nC. TheFifteenthAmendmentProhibitsIntentionalVoteDilution.\nClaiming that the Supreme Court has “specifically refus[ed] to extend [the Fifteenth\nAmendment’s] reach to cover allegations of vote dilution,” Defendants further argue (at 8) that\nCount III should be dismissed. Defendants are wrong. The Supreme Court “has not decided\nwhether the Fifteenth Amendment applies to vote-dilution claims.” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507\nU.S.146,159(1993).2\nTo besure,somenonbindinglower courtdecisions have taken thelackof SupremeCourt\nprecedent to mean that vote dilution does not violate the Fifteenth Amendment. But other\ndecisions—including the Hastert decision from this District—have recognized that intentionally\ndiscriminatory redistricting may violate the Fifteenth Amendment. E.g., Hastert, 777 F. Supp. at\n645 (“Racial gerrymandering violates ... the Fifteenth Amendment”); Page v. Bartels, 248 F.3d\n175, 193 & n.12 (3d Cir. 2001) (“a redistricting scheme may also violate the Fifteenth\nAmendment, at least if done with the purpose of depriving a racial minority group of the right to\nvote”). What is more, the Supreme Court has observed that the language of Section 2—which\nforbids intentional vote dilution—“track[s], in part, the text of the Fifteenth Amendment.”\nBartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1240. These similar provisions should be interpreted similarly. See\nNorthcross v. Bd. of Educ. of Memphis City Schs., 412 U.S. 427, 428 (1973) (interpreting two\nprovisions similarly because one “tracks the wording” of the other and has the same “‘raison\nd’être’”).\n2 AlthoughdictainReno v.BossierParishSchoolBoard,528U.S.320,334n.3(2000), disputes\nthat prior Supreme Court decisions made vote dilution a Fifteenth Amendment violation, that\ndecisiondoesnothingmorethan keeptheissueundecided.\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 9 of 17 PageID #:629\nCountIIIpleadsaviableFifteenthAmendmentclaimandthus shouldnotbedismissed.\nII. The Complaint States A Claim Of Racial Gerrymandering In Violation Of The\nFourteenthAmendment.\nDefendants’ argument for dismissing Count IV—which alleges that District 4 is an\nunconstitutional racial gerrymander—is utterly meritless. To state a racial gerrymander claim, a\nplaintiff must plead that racewas “thepredominantfactor motivatingthelegislature’s decision to\nplace a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.” Miller v. Johnson,\n515U.S.900,916(1995);seeShaw v.Reno,509 U.S.630(1993).\nThe Complaint undeniably makes that allegation with respect to District 4. It alleges that\n“Latino ethnicity was the predominant consideration in the creation of proposed District 4.”\nCompl. ¶ 62. And the Complaint does not stop there. It further describes how the “tortured\n‘earmuff’ shape” of the district—which scores low on every measure of compactness while it\n“captur[es]predominatelyLatinoneighborhoodstothenorth andsouthofproposedDistrict7”to\nproduce an “extremely high concentration of Latino voters” in the district—can be explained\nonlybytheuseofraceas thepredominantfactorindrawingthedistrict. Id. ¶¶3,59-66,125.The\nComplaint also explains that previous litigation in this District “established that race—that is,\nLatino ethnicity—was the predominant consideration in the creation of” a predecessor District 4\nthat had a “very similar shape” and was “in the same location” as the newly adopted District 4.\nId.¶60-61; seeKingv.StateBd.ofElections,979 F.Supp.582,607 (N.D.Ill.1996).\nDefendants surprisingly respond (at 7-8) that District 4 cannot be unconstitutional\nbecause it resembles the prior racially gerrymandered district. For support they cite Karcher v.\nDaggett, 462 U.S. 725, 740 (1983), which stated that “preserving the cores of prior districts”\nmay be a “legitimate objective[]” justifying population deviance among congressional districts\nwhere there is “a proper showing” that the objective is “nondiscriminatory.” But here, of course,\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 10 of 17 PageID #:630\nPlaintiffs allege that the prior district did discriminate on the basis of race (Compl. ¶¶60-61),\nand this District found that to be the case as a matter of fact. King, 979 F. Supp. at 607. The\nupshot of Defendants’ argument is that entrenched racial discrimination does not violate the\nConstitution. That pernicious argument flies in the face of the Fourteenth Amendment’s purpose\nto eradicate such racial discrimination. Because long-standing racial gerrymanders, no less than\nnewlymintedones,canviolatetheConstitution,CountIVshouldnotbedismissed.\nIII. The Complaint States A Claim Of Partisan Gerrymandering In Violation Of The\nFirstAndFourteenthAmendments.\nA. PartisanGerrymanderingClaimsAreJusticiable.\nThe Supreme Court held in Davis v. Bandemer that partisan gerrymandering claims are\njusticiable. 478 U.S. 109, 118-27 (1986). In Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004), Justice\nKennedy (in concurrence) and four other Justices (in dissent) agreed that that partisan\ngerrymander claims remain justiciable, over the objections of the remaining four Justices. As\nJustice Kennedy later explained, “[a] plurality of the Court in Vieth would have held such\nchallenges to be nonjusticiable political questions, but a majority declined to do so.” LULAC,\n548U.S.at414(Kennedy, J.).\nDefendants incredibly argue (at 13) that Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander claims (Counts\nV and VI) should be dismissed as nonjusticiable “[t]o the extent that Justice Kennedy’s\nconcurrence ... in Vieth may be construed to have been based on non-justiciability.” But\nconstruing Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in that manner would be absurd. As Justice Kennedy\nhimself wrote in LULAC, his concurrence in Vieth “declined” to hold “such challenges to be\nnonjusticiable political questions.” 548 U.S. at 414. Defendants provide no reason to question\nJustice Kennedy’s understanding of his own opinion. This Court should adjudicate Plaintiffs’\npartisan gerrymanderingclaims onthemerits.\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 11 of 17 PageID #:631\nB. TheComplaintAlleges SufficientFactsToSurviveAMotionToDismiss.\nWhile Defendants laud the fact that “[p]artisan gerrymandering has existed since this\ncountry was founded” (at 10), it is equallytrue that the Supreme Court has recognized that some\npartisan gerrymandering violates the Constitution. See, e.g., Vieth, 541 U.S. at 312 (Kennedy, J.)\n(“If a State passed an enactment that declared ‘All future apportionment shall be drawn so as\nmost to burden Party X’s rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with\none-person, one-vote principles,’ we would surely conclude the Constitution had been\nviolated.”).\nDefendants (at 11) nevertheless seek dismissal because the Complaint does not\n“explicitly offer any standard” to determine whether a gerrymander is unconstitutional.3 That\nstance grossly misunderstands a plaintiff’s pleading burden. “Under the notice pleading standard\n... a complaint need not contain legal theories.” Aaron, 550 F.3d at 666. Indeed, “[o]n a motion\nto dismiss, defendants have the burden of demonstrating the legal insufficiency of the\ncomplaint—not theplaintiffs orthecourt.” Reyes v. CityofChicago, 585 F.Supp.2d 1010,1017\n(N.D. Ill. 2008). Defendants may not shift that burden to Plaintiffs. If anything, it is Defendants\nwho must offer an acceptable standard that the Complaint fails to meet. They have not done so.\nThataloneshouldprecludedismissalofPlaintiffs’partisangerrymanderingclaims.\nIn any event, Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to show that an unlawful political\ngerrymander exists under any plausible standard the Court might adopt. The Complaint alleges\nwith overwhelming factual detail how the State’s redistricting plan tramples the constitutional\nrights of Republican voters. It alleges that the Democratic-controlled Redistricting Committees\n3 Contradicting themselves, Defendants also say (at 11-12) that Plaintiffs propose a standard\nakin to Justice Powell’s since-rejected “fairness” standard. But the Complaint does not say\nanything about a standard; it pleads facts. That the partisan gerrymander allegations satisfy\nJustice Powell’s standard—and many other potential standards—is not an endorsement of any\nparticularstandard.\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 12 of 17 PageID #:632\nprohibited the public from questioning committee members and reneged on their promises for\ntransparency. Compl. ¶¶38-40. It alleges how the proposed congressional district map was\nreleased for public scrutiny at 4:00 a.m. on the Friday of the Memorial Day weekend and how\nwithin days it cleared both Democratic-controlled houses of the Illinois legislature on straight\nparty-line votes. Id. ¶¶41-45. It alleges how the map packs Republican voters into certain\ndistricts and slices other traditionally Republican areas, like DuPage County, into districts with\nreliable majorities of Democratic voters. Id. ¶¶ 4, 74, 78-81, 90-92. It alleges how the map pits\nRepublican incumbents against one another while sparing all Democratic incumbents from\nsimilar contests (id. ¶¶ 87-89), and how Democratic incumbents have a 77.52% average\npopulation overlap between their present and proposed constituents while the Republican\nincumbents’ average is only 34.20% (id. ¶¶93-95). It alleges how the map abandons time-\nhonored principles of compactness in favor of “snake-shaped” districts and districts with\n“curving hook[s].” Id. ¶¶5, 81, 96-100. It alleges how these boundary changes will transform\nIllinois from a state with an 11-to-8 Republican majority in its congressional delegation into a\nstate with a 6-to-12 Republican minority. Id. ¶¶1, 73. It even alleges how the New York Times\nreported that the congressional redistricting plan takes “aggressive” partisan “maneuvering” to\nthe extreme (id. ¶1) by “activat[ing] every switch at [Democrats’] disposal: clout, secrecy and\nspools ofelectronicdatathat guidedblock-by-blockprecision”(id.¶6).\nThese factual allegations state a claim under the First Amendment. As Justice Kennedy\nobserved in Vieth, the First Amendment prohibits “burdening or penalizing citizens because of\ntheir participation in the electoral process, their voting history, their association with a political\nparty, or their expression of political views.” 541 U.S. at 314; see Cal. Democratic Party v.\nJones, 530 U.S. 567 (2000); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976) (plurality). The amendment is\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 13 of 17 PageID #:633\nviolated where “a State enacts a law that has the purpose and effect of subjecting a group of\nvoters or their party to disfavored treatment by reason of their views.” Vieth, 541 U.S. at 314.\nPlaintiffs’Complaintmakesthoseallegations. SeeCompl.¶¶131-132.\nPlaintiffs’ allegations likewise state a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nClassifications that limit the right to cast an undiluted vote and the right to express partisan\npreferences can violate the Equal Protection Clause. Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 751\n(1973); Whitcomb v.Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 143(1971). To succeed on an equalprotection claim,\na plaintiff must plead and ultimately prove intentional discrimination against an identifiable\ngroup and an actual discriminatory effect on that group. Davis, 478 U.S. at 127 (plurality); id. at\n161 (Powell, J., joined by Stevens, J., concurring in part); Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 617\n(1982)(describingashowingofpurposeand effect as “thestandard ofproof generallyapplicable\nto Equal Protection Clause cases”). Plaintiffs’ allegations show that the Democratic-controlled\nIllinois government adopted a partisan gerrymander that intentionally and successfully\ndiscriminates against Republican voters because of their political affiliations. Compl. ¶¶136-\n138.PlaintiffsthereforestateaclaimundertheEqualProtectionClause.\nGiven the Supreme Court’s continued recognition that partisan gerrymandering can\nviolate the Constitution, the only real question is whether, as a matter of fact, the political\ngerrymander here crosses the line dividing constitutional uses of partisanship in redistricting\nfrom unconstitutional ones. That question is best reserved for an adjudication at trial once all\nrelevant evidence has been gathered. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford Plaintiffs the\nopportunityto gather additionalfacts,andthatopportunityshouldberespected.\nIn sum, neither of Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims—Count V and Count VI—\nshouldbedismissed.\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 14 of 17 PageID #:634\nIV. PlaintiffsHaveNotPleadedThemselves Out OfCourt.\nFinally, Defendants claim (at 13-15) that Plaintiffs have pleaded themselves out of court\non Counts I through IV by alleging that some districts were drawn to protect Democratic\ninterestsandincumbents.Onceagain,Defendants misreadtheComplaintandmisstatethelaw.\nWith respect to District 4, Defendants are flat wrong in claiming the Complaint alleges\nthat anything other than race played any role in drawing the district. None of the Complaint\nparagraphs that Defendants invoke remotely support that claim. Paragraph 5 alleges that District\n5 sweeps from Lake Michigan “around the Latino enclaves on Chicago’s west side that are\npacked into proposed District 4” to capture Congresswoman Biggert’s home, and Paragraph 85\nalleges that District 5 “swings south around proposed District 4.” These allegations in no way\nundermine Plaintiffs’ claim that race was the predominant factor motivating District 4’s shape.\nTheallegationin Paragraph95thatDistrict4hasthelowestpopulationoverlapof allDemocratic\nincumbents’ districts actually supports the idea that race, not politics, was the driving force\nbehind the shape of District 4. Finally, Paragraph 96 merely lists Illinois communities that the\nState unnecessarily divided in drawing congressional districts; it makes no allegation as to\nwhetheritwaspartisanshiporracethatmotivated thedivisionofanyparticularcommunity.\nThe Complaint’s express allegation that the State’s redistricting plan “intentionally made\nrace—namely, Latino ethnicity—the predominant factor in the creation of proposed District 4”\nthus stands uncontradicted. Compl. ¶ 125; see also id. ¶¶ 62, 110, 115, 120. Accordingly,\nPlaintiffs have not pleaded themselves out of court on either their racial gerrymander (Count IV)\norintentionalvotedilution(Counts I-III) claimsas toDistrict4.\nAs for District 3 and District 5—which, along with District 4, are alleged in Counts I\nthrough III to intentionally discriminate against Latinos by diluting their votes—the Complaint\ndoes plead that partisan considerations played some role in the creation of those districts. But\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 15 of 17 PageID #:635\nPlaintiffs need not showthat theState’s solepurposewas to discriminateagainst Latinos in order\nto press a claim for intentional discrimination. The authorities are unequivocal that “‘[r]acial\ndiscrimination need onlybe onepurpose,and noteven aprimarypurpose, ofan official act’fora\nviolation to occur.” Brown, 561 F.3d at 433; accord Garza, 918 F.2d at 771 (“discrimination\nneed not be the sole goal in order to be unlawful”). As the Seventh Circuit has explained, even\nwhere the “[d]esire to protect incumbents” is “the dominant desire actuating the redistricting\nplan,”sucha goalmaynotbeaccomplishedthroughintentionalracialdiscrimination. Barnett,32\nF.3d at 1199. “Thefact that discrimination mayhavean ulteriormotivethatis not discriminatory\ndoes not make it any the less intentional.” Id.4 Because Plaintiffs need not rule out other\nmotivations when alleging intentional discrimination, they come nowhere close to pleading\nthemselves outof courtas totheclaimsbasedon Districts3and5(CountsIthrough III).\nFurthermore, in Tamayo v. Blagojevich, 526 F.3d 1074 (7th Cir. 2008), on which\nDefendants surprisingly rely (at 14-15), the Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiff did not plead\nherself out of court by alleging “additional facts that suggest that the defendants’ actions were\nmotivated by a political power struggle rather than by gender-based animus.” Id. at 1086. The\ncourt concluded that while her additional allegations may “make her success on the merits less\nlikely,” that was not enough to dismiss her complaint. “[O]ur pleading rules ... do permit\ninconsistencies in legal theories,” the Court noted. Id. Here too, even if the Complaint’s\nallegations about partisan gerrymandering were in tension with the allegations about racial\ndiscrimination and somehow make it more difficult for Plaintiffs to prevail at trial, that does not\nmean that Plaintiffs have pleaded themselves out of court. Plaintiffs may “state as manyseparate\n4 Defendants’ reliance (at 13) on Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234 (2001), is completely\nmisplaced with respect to Counts I through III because Easley concerned only a racial\ngerrymanderclaim,nota claimforintentionallydiscriminatoryracialvotedilution.\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 67 Filed: 09/28/11 Page 16 of 17 PageID #:636\nclaims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency” (Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3)) and “[p]leadings\nmustbeconstruedsoastodojustice”(Fed.R.Civ.P.8(e)).\nV. If The Complaint’s Allegations Are Deemed Deficient, Plaintiffs Should Be Given\nLeavetoFileAnAmendedComplaint.\nThe Complaint’s allegations are more than sufficient under the relevant case law to\nsurvive the Defendants’ motion to dismiss. To the extent that the Court reaches a different\nconclusion, however, Plaintiffs ask for leave to file an amended complaint. “Generally, if a\ndistrict court dismisses for failure to state a claim, the court should give the party one\nopportunity to try to cure the problem, even if the court is skeptical about the prospects for\nsuccess.” Bausch v. Stryker Corp., 630 F.3d 546, 562 (7th Cir. 2010). Such an opportunity is\nespecially appropriate here because additional evidence supporting Plaintiffs’ claims has been\ndevelopedsincethefilingoftheComplaint.5\nCONCLUSION\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss should be denied. Alternatively, the Court should allow\nPlaintiffs theopportunitytofileanamended complainttocureanydeficiencies.\n5 See Rich Miller (Sept. 22, 2011), http://capitolfax.com/2011/09/22/black-delegation-takes-\nstep-back-from-new-map/ (quoting Rep.

John D. Tinder\n)    Hon. Joan H. Lefkow\nv. )    Hon. Robert L. Miller, Jr.\n)    (3-judge court convened pursuant\nILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS,  )    to 28 U.S.C. § 2284)\nET AL., )    \n)    \nDefendants. )    \nPLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO MOTION TO QUASH CURRENT AND FUTURE \nSUBPOENAS IN VIOLATION OF THIS COURT’S ORDER\nDuring discovery in this action, Plaintiffs unsurprisingly have learned of three additional \nthird party witnesses with information relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims set forth in the Complaint.  \nPromptly after discovering the identities of these witnesses and before the close of discovery, \nPlaintiffs took steps to secure the depositions of these individuals:  former Congressman William \nLipinski, Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., and Rockford Mayor Lawrence J. Morrissey.  In what \ncan only be described as self-serving litigation strategy, Defendants have moved to quash the \ndepositions of these three third party witnesses claiming without citation to any legal authority \nthat the depositions are somehow improper and unfair to them.  Tellingly, none of the targets of \nthe subpoenas have joined in Defendants’ motion to quash (“Motion”) or have otherwise asked \nthis Court for relief from the subpoenas.  For the reasons set forth below, Defendants’ Motion is \nwithout merit and should be denied. \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 87 Filed: 10/19/11 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:835\nI. The Witnesses Sought Are Relevant To This Action.\nDefendants conclusorily complain that the three witnesses have no information relevant \nto the Plaintiffs’ claims.  Simply stated, it is not Defendants’ place to decide whether third party \ndeponents, who did not join in Defendants’ Motion, may have information likely to lead to \nadmissible evidence.  As demonstrated below, evidence discovered to date certainly establishes \ninformation  likely to  be  obtained  from  these  three  witnesses  meets  the  low  threshold  for \nrelevance at this discovery stage of these proceedings.  \nA. William O. Lipinski\nDefendants  deposed  Congressman  John  Shimkus  on  September  29, 2011 and \nCongresswoman Judy Biggert on October 10, 2011.  In those depositions and upon further \ninvestigation, Plaintiffs gained a good faith basis to believe that former Congressman Lipinski \nplayed a material role in the drafting of Adopted Plan CD3, the district drawn for his son, \nincumbent  Congressman  Dan  Lipinski.    Upon  learning  about  William  Lipinski’s  likely \npossession  of  information  relevant  to  the  planning,  creation,  and  development  of  the  2011 \nIllinois  congressional  redistricting  plan  (“Plan”)  enacted  as  Illinois  P.A.  97-14,  Plaintiffs \npromptly contacted Mr. Lipinski and determined that it was necessary to depose him.  After \nseveral discussions with Mr. Lipinski in an effort to arrange a mutually convenient time for his \ndeposition, on Monday, October 17, Congressman Lipinski informed the undersigned counsel \nthat Michael Kasper, one of the counsel for the Defendants, would arrange for his deposition.  \nThe undersigned counsel immediately contacted attorney Kasper with no response other than the \nfiling of this Motion.  Mot. ¶ 8.  Mr. Lipinski’s anticipated testimonyis fact-based, limited to his \npersonal involvement in influencing the drawing of CD3 which the Plaintiffs have alleged was \n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 87 Filed: 10/19/11 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:836\ndiluted of Latino voting age population (“VAP”) to benefit a white incumbent to the detriment of \nLatinos.  Dkt.No.1 at 2,14.  Lipinski’s testimony is therefore highly relevant.\nB. Subpoena of Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr.\nPlaintiffs subpoenaed Congressman Jackson, who has spoken publicly about the Plan,1 on \nOctober 14, 2011.  Congressman Jackson has publicly expressed serious concerns that the \nAdopted Plan violates the Voting Rights Act by providing for only one Latino majority district.  \nJackson has also been highly critical of the process by which the Plan was drafted, saying that\n“[t]o gain a Democratic majority and partisan advantage, some Democrats may be prepared to \ntamper  with  and  possibly violate  the  VRA,  rather  than  support  strict  enforcement  of  its \nprovisions.” See supra n.1. Congressman Jackson’s comments have been widely reported by \nlocal and national media outlets.  It should come as no surprise to Defendants that Plaintiffs are \ninterested in formally discovering, for example, “the specific sequence of events leading up to \nthe challenged decision [and] departures from the normal procedural sequence. . .”  Dkt. No. 77 \nat 7.  \nC. Mayor Lawrence J. Morrissey\nPlaintiffs learned of Mayor Morrissey’s relevance during the October 7, 2011 deposition \nof Donald Manzullo, who testified about the Plan’s negative impact on Rockford, Illinois.  Ex. \nA.    Plaintiffs  promptly  reached  out  to  Mayor  Morrissey,  but  not  before  counsel  for  the \nDefendants.2  On October 14, 2011, Plaintiffs notified Defendants that the Mayor agreed to be \ndeposed  in  this  matter.    Ex.  B.    As  apparently Mayor  Morrissey informed  counsel  for \nDefendants, who called him directly on or about October 7, he is very alarmed that for the first \ntime since the 1850s, Rockford will be in more than one Congressional district, divided along \n   \n1 See Rich Miller (Sept. 22, 2011), http://capitolfax.com/2011/09/22/black-delegation-takesstep-back-from-\nnew-map/.\n2 Apparently, Defendants’ attorney Bruce and the Mayor are lawschool classmates.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 87 Filed: 10/19/11 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:837\nracial lines and the minority community of Rockford will reside in a district where the major \npopulation center is over 100 miles awayin a completelydifferent part of the state.  The Mayor’s \ntestimonyis relevant to the communityof interest allegations in the complaint.  Dkt. No. 1 at 22,\n43.\nII. The Timing Of The Depositions Of These Witnesses Poses No “Unfairness” To \nDefendants.\nDefendants’ Motion is laced with protests that these depositions are somehow unfair to \nthem.  This argument is unwarranted.  The scheduling of depositions highlights who Plaintiffs \nbelieve  has  relevant  information  and  also  provides  Defendants  with  ample  opportunity to \nparticipate in the depositions of the witnesses and thereby avoid actual surprise in advance of \ntrial.  Defendants were notified of these depositions well in advance of the October 19, 2011 \ndiscoverycutoff date.  \nFirst,  Defendants’  objection  that  these  subpoenas  are  in  violation  of  this  Court’s \nDiscovery and Preliminary Pre-Trial Order is without merit.  By agreement of the parties, the \nCourt revised its initial Discovery and Preliminary Pre-Trial Order to postpone the close of fact \ndepositions to October 19, 2011.  But, as Defendants acknowledge (Mot. at 2 n.1), the tight \ndiscovery schedule has required both sides to accommodate witnesses as well as lawyers by \nagreeing to schedule fact depositions after the October 19, 2011.  Moreover, recently one senior \nattorneyfor Defendants informed counsel for the Plaintiffs that he personallyhad no objection to \nscheduling  fact  witnesses  past  October  19th in  the  context  of  discussion  about  scheduling \nwitnesses the Defendants sought.  Likewise, these three depositions were noticed within the \ndiscoveryperiod and then proposed at times to accommodate calendar conflicts of the witness or \nopposing counsel.  The timing of these depositions simply is another example of the need for \nsome flexibility and cooperation on all sides, particularly in light of the aggressive discovery \n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 87 Filed: 10/19/11 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:838\nschedule and the unavoidable conflicts with the schedules of the attorneys and deponents, some \nof whom are United States Congressmen.3\nFurthermore, Defendant’s objection that these depositions will take place after expert \ndiscoveryis a red herring.  As a preliminarymatter, Defendants provide no legal basis to support \ntheir request to quash the subpoenas of the witnesses on the grounds that the depositions will\noccur after the expert depositions.  In addition, all three witnesses challenged by Defendants are \nfact witnesses, not expert witnesses and likely will offer facts that are outside the scope of the \nexpert witness testimony from both sides.  As is clear form the expert reports already exchanged, \nthe experts in this case are examining data—census data, voting patterns, population movements, \nand other demographic information.  The suggestion that the opinions staked out bythese experts \nwill be affected byfact testimonyof three current and former public officials about their personal \nviews of and involvement with (or exclusion from) the redistricting process is nonsense.  In any \nevent, Defendants’ professed concern regarding their experts is pure speculation at this time \nsince they cannot possibly know whether the testimony impacts their expert opinions until after\nit has been given.  See Hall v. Shelter General Ins. Co., 2007 WL 2142984, at *2 (S.D. Ill. Jul. \n25, 2007).\nFinally, the timing of these three fact witness depositions will have no impact upon the \nrest of the Court’s schedule.  Tellingly, Defendants make no such allegation. \nIII. Plaintiffs Should Be Free To Use Evidence From These Witnesses.\nFurthermore, even if the Court were to grant the extreme relief of disallowing these \ndepositions,  Defendants  can  have  no  basis  to  complain  in  the  future  when  Plaintiffs  offer \n   \n3 Indeed, Defendants are well aware of the challenges of the aggressive discovery schedule in this case since \nthey asked to revisit the already decided discovery dates of numerous of the individual plaintiffs in this action \nshortly  after  engaging  new  counsel.    For  example,  Congresswoman  Biggert’s  deposition  was  cancelled  by \nDefendants the afternoon of the businessdaybefore her deposition was originally supposed to take place.\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 87 Filed: 10/19/11 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:839\nevidence from these witnesses.  All three witnesses now have timely been disclosed (before the \nclose of discovery) as individuals likelyto have discoverable information in compliance with the \ndeadline set forth in Section 3.3 of the Court’s Discovery and Preliminary Pre-Trial Order.  \nPlaintiffs’ disclosures are well within the Court’s Nov. 7, 2011 cutoff date.  The fact that \nDefendants seek to block depositions of these witnesses now does not change the fact that they \nhave been properly disclosed.  Moreover, if Defendants persist in their objections to these \ndepositions, they should be precluded from offering any affirmative evidence from them as it \nwould be inherently unfair for Defendants to move to quash these depositions and then to \naffirmatively use evidence from these individuals.  \nWHEREFORE, for the forgoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion To Quash Current And \nFuture Subpoenas In Violation Of This Court’s Order should be denied. \nDated: October 19, 2011 Respectfullysubmitted,\n/s/ Lori E.

As set forth in the Complaint, that process contained the\nfollowing important elements that are relevant to the current efforts by these same Springfield\nDemocrats to shield from public view the real process which birthed this constitutionally infirm\nPlan:\n1. The actual deliberations that resulted in the Plan were completely and intentionally shielded\nfrom public view. Despite pretenses and promises to the contrary, and demands from the\npublic to see the Congressional plan, no Congressional plan was submitted for discussion\nduringatwo-month “public”hearingprocess.2\n2. The first time that the public ever saw the Plan was approximately4:00 a.m. on the Fridayof\ntheMemorialDayholidayweekend.3 Nopublichearings wereheld. Id. Thefinalversionof\nthePlanwasnotrevealed untilMemorialDay, Monday,May30.\n3. Over the holiday weekend, that Plan then passed both chambers of the Democratically-\n1SeeAppendixforthesourceofallquotesinthisIntroductionsection.\n2 See Cmplt. at ¶¶ 39, 40. Pursuant to a rule established by the Democratic chairpersons of the\ncommittees, members of the public were not permitted to ask questions of the members of the\nRedistrictingCommitteesduringthisprocess. SeeCmplt.at¶38.\n3 See Mapping in the Dark: Redistricting Illinois in 2011: Politics as Usual Under a Facade of\nTransparency,ILL.CAMPAIGNFORPOLITICALREFORMat9(2011),http://www.ilcampaign.org/mapping-\nin-the-dark-redistricting-2011.\n-1-\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 3 of 17 PageID #:581\ncontrolled General Assembly without any public hearing, and predictably, along a straight,\nparty-line vote. See Cmplt. at ¶¶ 42-45. The final vote came on Tuesday, May 31, just one\ndayafterthefinalPlanwasfirstunveiled.4\n4. The public portion of the review and passage of the final Plan consisted of a total of just a\nfew hours on Memorial Day, between when the final amendment was first filed and then\nvotedonbytheHouse.5\n5. During House and Senate floor discussions, when questioned, Democratic members who\ncontrolled the floor debate refused to answer important questions about the Plan. For\nexample, when Republican Senator Kirk Dillard asked whether it was possible to draw two\nLatino districts, including one of the southwest side of Chicago, Senate Redistricting\nCommittee Chairman Kwame Raoul stated that he did not know because he “didn’t draw the\nmap.” When asked who drewthemap,Chairman Raoul responded, “Staff members—Idon’t\nknow which specific ones.” When Senator Dillard asked “why does this map substantially\ndilute Latino representation in proposed district 3,” Chairman Raoul stated that he was\nunaware of that conclusion. When Senate Dale Righter asked “who were the experts\nresponsible for [reviewing] these [Congressional] lines,” Chairman Raoul responded: “I\ndon’thaveknowledgeof that.”6\nOf course the actual actions of the Springfield Democrats are not the only thing shielded\nfrom view. What is also lurking just below the surface of this dark bottomless pool is the role of\nthe national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (“DCCC”) who the Springfield\nDemocrats invited into this process. On information and belief, the DCCC and/or its agents and\nemployees drew significant portions of the Plan as part of a larger national political agenda. See\nExhibitDtoPlaintiffs’MotiontoCompel[Dkt.52].\nIt is against this backdrop that the Springfield Democrats ask this Court to impose\nblanket,absoluteimmunityfromanyinquiryintotheiractions. Whatis fundamentallyatstakeis\nnot just whether these Springfield Democrats can purposefully subvert the federal interest in the\nenforcement of important federal laws such as the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”). To be sure,\nPlaintiffs’ motion arises from their effort to vindicate the VRA and other important federal\n4 See Bill Status of S.B. 1178, 97TH ILL. GEN. ASSEMBLY, available at\nhttp://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=1178&GAID=11&GA=97&DocTypeID=SB&Le\ngID=56012&SessionID=84.\n5Id.

Equally as\nimportant, however, is whether these Springfield Democrats or any future, one-party dominated\nGeneral Assembly, can effectively thwart any federal oversight of legislative action which\ndirectly implicates important federal questions by legislating inside a black box insulated by\nlegislative privilege. If the answer to that question is yes, then the VRA offers no protection to\nanyIllinoisvoter.\nOf course, the actual law dictates a different result. The case law establishes that all of\nthe information sought by the Subpoenas is discoverable, including documents that reflect\nRespondents’7 deliberations about the Plan. As set forth in Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel,\ndecades of precedent clearly establish the following guiding principles for resolution of this\nparticulardispute:\n1. Thereis arecognized privilege fromdiscoveryfor statelawmakers, but it is qualified and not\nabsoluteas Respondents urge. MotiontoCompelat¶¶9-11.8\n2. That qualified privilege must yield when, after applying a balancing test, a Court finds that\ntheinterests ofdisclosureoutweightheinterestsofconfidentiality. Id.\n3. In this instance, a balancing of the relevant factors requires a finding that Respondents are\nnot entitled to assert legislative privilege for any documents sought pursuant to Plaintiffs’\nSubpoenas. MotiontoCompelat¶¶11-17.\nAs to the first factor, Respondents do not denythat the evidence sought to be protected is\n7PlaintiffswillrefertotherecipientsofitsSubpoenascollectivelyas“Respondents.”\n8SeeVillageofArlingtonHeightsv.Metro.Hous.Dev.Corp.,429U.S.252,268(1977);UnitedStatesv.\nGillock,445 U.S. 360, 370 (1980); In re Grand Jury,821 F.2d 946, 957 (3d Cir. 1987); Rodriguez v.\nPataki,280F.Supp.2d89,102(S.D.N.Y.2003)(redistrictingcase);Kayv.CityofRanchoPalosVerdes,\n2003 WL 25294710, No. CV 02–03922, at *9-14 (C.D.

Supp.2d at102, and\nthat direct evidence of their discriminatory intent can be obtained from no other source. As\nPlaintiffs’ explained in their Motion, the second factor—the seriousness of the litigation and the\nissues involved—supports piercing Respondents’ qualified privilege. As is evident from the\ndetailed facts pleaded in the Complaint, the allegations of government misconduct are both\nserious and well-founded. Indeed, additional proof that Plaintiffs’ claims are well-founded is the\nfactthat threeDemocraticMembers of Congress from Illinois (Representatives JesseJackson Jr.,\nDanny Davis, and Bobby Rush) recently released a statement announcing that they would not\nhelp defend the Plan because it discriminates against Latinos. See Jackson Won’t Back New Ill.\nCongressionalMap,Sept.22,2011,salon.com(AttachedheretoasExhibitB).\nThe next factor—the “[f]ederal interest in the enforcement of federal law,” Irvin, 127\nF.R.D. at 171—strongly favors the requested discovery. As Plaintiffs explained, the very\npurpose of the VRA is to act as a check on state legislators. Motion to Compel at ¶¶ 13-15.\nRespondents are attempting to thwart any federal oversight of voters’ constitutional rights by\neffectively denying any plaintiff the ability to ferret out intent behind legislative actions. The\nfourth factor supports piercing of the privilege because government action and participation is\ndirectly implicated in this lawsuit. Id. at ¶ 16. And as to the last factor, the fear that disclosure\nin this case will chill legislators in their future communications is entirely speculative. Id. at ¶\n17. For these reasons, Respondents should not be permitted to protect any of their responsive\ndocumentsbyrelyingon thelegislativeprivilege.\nIn any event, even if Respondents were entitled to assert some form of legislative\nprivilege over documents reflecting their core deliberations, many of the documents sought by\nthe Subpoenas fall outside the scope of privilege. For the reasons explained in the Motion to\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 6 of 17 PageID #:584\nCompel and below, communications with outsiders (such as Democratic Members of Congress\nand the DCCC) are not privileged. Similarly, objective facts on which Respondents’ relied to\ndrawthemap falloutsidethescopeofboththelegislative(anddeliberativeprocess)privileges.\nRespondents’ other assertions of privilege similarly fail. The Court should deny\nRespondents’Motionand grantPlaintiffs’MotiontoCompel.\nARGUMENT\nI. LegislativePrivilegeForStateLegislatorsis Qualified,NotAbsolute\nRespondents’ Motion to Quash and for a Protective Order [Dkt. 59] rests entirely on the\nfaulty premise that state legislators are absolutely immune from discovery concerning their\nlegislative activities—they are not. See Motion to Compel at ¶¶ 9-11. The Supreme Court has\ntwice recognized that there is no absolute testimonial or evidentiary privilege for state\nlegislators. In Gillock, 445 U.S. at 370, the Court rejected an argument by a state legislator\ncharged with bribery that his legislative privilege prohibited the introduction of any evidence at\nhis federal criminal trial concerning his legislative acts and the motivations underlying them.\n445U.S. at366. Andin ArlingtonHeights,429U.S.at268,theCourtrecognizedthatlegislators\n“mightbecalledtothestandattrialtotestifyconcerningthepurposeoftheofficialaction.”\nWhile some courts have erroneously considered the privilege to be absolute, most that\nhave considered the question have found that it is only a qualified privilege, subject to a\nbalancing test analysis. See, e.g. Kay, 2003 WL 25294710, at *9-14 (surveying authorities and\nconcluding “although some cases suggest the privilege is absolute, the better view is that it is\nqualified”). Recognizing that state legislators enjoy only a qualified privilege against discovery,\nthe great weight of courts have applied a balancing test, examining, as urged herein. See cases\ncitedsupran.7; seealsoMotiontoCompel¶¶9-10.\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 7 of 17 PageID #:585\nRespondents’ Motion improperly conflates state legislators’ absolute immunity from civil\nsuit and qualified legislative privilege from discovery. Further, many of the cases cited in\nRespondents’ Motion pertain to federal Congresspersons’ absolute privilege from discovery in\nmatters related to their legislative function, which has its source in the Speech or Debate Clause\nof the Constitution, and which the Supreme Court has specifically found to be inapplicable to\nstatelegislatorssuchas Respondents.\nUnlike federal legislators, Respondents cannot claim the protection of the Constitution’s\nSpeech or Debate Clause. Byits terms, the Speech or Debate Clause applies only to members of\nthe U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and therefore does not apply to state legislators.\nU.S. Const.,Art. I,§ 6, cl. 1.(“The Senators and Representatives * * * shall not bequestioned in\nany other place” than “their respective Houses” for any “Speech or Debate.”); Lake County\nEstates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 404 (1979) (Speech or Debate\nClause is “[not] applicable to the members of state legislatures”). The Clause provides\nprotection from both liability and third-party discovery as it pertains to acts taken in\nCongresspersons’ legislative capacities. Most of the cases cited by Respondents for the\nproposition that state legislators’ protection from discovery is absolute concern the inapplicable\nSpeech or Debate Clause. See, e.g. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Williams, 62 F.3d\n408, 417 (D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501 (1972); Gravel v. United\nStates,408U.S.606 (1972); Doev.McMillan,412U.S.306,312-312(1973); MINPECO,S.A. v.\nConticommodity Services, Inc., 844 F.2d 856 (D.C. Cir. 1988); and McSurely v. McClellan, 553\nF.2d1277(D.C.Cir.1976).9\n9 The Fourth Circuit in E.E.O.C. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm’n, 631 F.3d 174, 181 (4th Cir.\n2011), appears to have made the same mistake as Respondents. That opinion discussed the Speech or\nDebate Clause and cited cases discussing that Clause, and then appears to have incorrectly applied the\nprotectionofthatClausetoalocalmunicipalboard. Id.at180-181.\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 8 of 17 PageID #:586\nWhereas both federal and state lawmakers enjoy “absolute legislative immunity” from\ncivil suit for “all actions taken in ‘the sphere of legitimate legislative activity,’” Bogan v. Scott-\nHarris, 523 U.S. 44,54 (1998), contraryto the assertions ofthe Respondents, theimmunity from\ndiscovery conferred on federal Congresspersons bythe Speech or Debate Clause does not extend\nto state lawmakers. In Gillock, the Supreme Court distinguished the Constitution-based\nprotection from discovery enjoyed by federal legislators from the more limited common law-\nbased protection that covers state and local legislators. As the Gillock Court observed,\ncompelling a state legislator to give evidence raised no separation of powers (or comity)\nconcerns because the Supremacy Clause clearly contemplated that federal law would prevail in\nareas such as enforcement of federal laws. Id.at 370. The Court held instead that “where\nimportantfederalinterestsareatstake***comityyields.” Id.at373.\nRespondents’ assertion that the “Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit ‘equate’ legislative\nimmunitywith the protections members of Congress enjoyin federal civil actions under the U.S.\nConstitution” (Motion to Quash at 7) is therefore true only with respect to immunity from suit,\nnot immunityfrom discovery. See Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union of the United\nStates, et al., 446 U.S. 719, 732-33 (1980); Gillock, 445 U.S. at 370; Pataki, 280 F. Supp. at 95\n(“Legislative privilege * * * is not absolute. * * * Thus, courts have indicated that,\nnotwithstanding their immunity from suit, legislators may, at times, be called upon to produce\ndocumentsortestifyatdepositions.”)(internalcitationsomitted).10\nA recent Seventh Circuit case to which Respondents cite (Bagley v. Blagojevich, 646\n10 As a further example, see National Ass’n of Social Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 634 (1st Cir.\n1995). Respondents cite that case for the proposition that “‘balancing [of harms] plays no part’” in\nlegislative immunity analysis.” Motion to Quash at 8. But that case involved state legislators’ absolute\nimmunity from suit; the case did not involve a request to discover information from the legislators.\nHarwood, 69 F.3d at 629. In Buonauro v. City of Berwyn, No. 08-cv-6687, 2011 WL 116870, at *9-10\n(N.D. Ill. Jan 10, 2011), the court specificallydeclined to adopt an absolute or balancing-test approach to\nthelegislativeprivilegequestion.\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 9 of 17 PageID #:587\nF.3d 378 (7th Cir. 2011)), is completely consistent with that approach. In Bagley, a group of\nformer state employees sued various officials includingthe former governor and his deputychief\nof staff, for wrongfully eliminating their positions through a veto of a budget line item that\nwould have provided funding for their jobs. Id. at 380-84. The Seventh Circuit considered the\nnatureof the Governor’s action in vetoingtheitem,concluded that it was legislativein character,\nand thus held that both the Governor and his deputy were absolutely immune from suit for these\nactions. Id. at 393-96. The Seventh Circuit further held that “the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in blocking the Governor’s deposition and limiting Curry’s deposition.” Id. at 396\n(emphasis added).\nUnlike this case, the Bagley decision involved an employment-related matter and was\nsituated in a long line of cases involving employment-related claims made against officials\nacting in a legislative capacity.11 Those cases did not involve the fundamental constitutional\nquestions posed by this lawsuit—questions with undeniable public dimensions. Also central to\nthe Bagley Court’s analysis was the fact that both the Governor and his aide were named\ndefendants in the lawsuit. Citing Dombrowski v. Eastland, 387 U.S. 82, 87 (1967), the Seventh\nCircuit reasoned that since legislative immunity protected the officials from “the consequences\nof litigation’s results,” it should also relieve them of “the burden of defending themselves” in\nlitigation to which they were named as defendants. Id. Indeed, Courts are less willing to pierce\nlegislative privilege when legislators are named parties in civil suits or the information obtained\nmightbeused against themin alater criminal prosecution. Compare In re Grand Jury, 821 F.2d\nat956.\n11 See id. at 393-96 (citing, inter alia, Nisenbaum v. Milwaukee County,333 F. 3d 804, 808 (7th Cir.\n2003); Strasburger v. Board of Education, Hardin County Community Unit School District No. 1, 143\nF.3d 351, 355 & n.1 (7th Cir. 1998); Baird v. Board of Education for Warren Community Unit School\nDistrictNo.205,389F.3d685,696(7thCir.2004)).\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 10 of 17 PageID #:588\nBut the privilege has far less force when the legislators from whom discovery is sought\nare not parties. Recently, a court in this circuit construed Bagley and other legislative privilege\ncases and found that “[n]o party has cited a case from the Supreme Court or the Seventh Circuit\nregarding the scope of the testimonial privilege where the party claiming the privilege is not a\ndefendant or a virtual alter ego of a defendant.” Metro Pony, LLC v. City of Metropolis, 11-cv-\n144-JPG, 2011 WL 2729153, at *2 (July 13, 2011 S.D. Ill.). The Metro Pony Court held that\n“[i]n the absence of any binding precedent applying the doctrine of legislative immunity and its\ncorresponding testimonial privilege to a non-party, this Court is not inclined to do so.” Id.\n(permitting deposition of mayor for actions taken in his legislative capacity). The Metro Pony\ncourt reasoned that because “Metro Pony seeks no relief from [the mayor] based on his clearly\nlegislative act * * * the original purposes of legislative immunity—to shield legislators from\nliability for their legislative acts—would not be served by applying the doctrine in the case at\nbar.” Id. Likewise, Plaintiffs havenotsuedRespondentsandseekno recoveryfromthem.12\nII. DiscoveryFromLegislatorsisOftenGrantedinRedistrictingCases\nAs the cases cited by Plaintiffs in their Motion to Compel make clear, courts often allow\ndiscovery on legislators in redistricting cases. See, e.g. Irvin,127 F.R.D. at 171; Rodriguez, 280\nF. Supp. 2d at 102-103. None of the cases cited by Respondents that denied such discovery\nperformed the balancing test required in such circumstances; they are accordingly of little\nprecedential value. For the reasons explained above and in the Motion to Compel (at ¶¶ 12-17),\n12 Another case to which Respondents cite, Shultz v. Stranczek, 1991 WL 328518 (7th Cir. 1991), is\ndistinguishable for the same reason. In that case it was the defendants who were claiming legislative\nimmunity. Id. Should the Court conclude that Respondents are entitled to an absolute legislative\nprivilege from discovery, Plaintiffs are entitled to a statement under oath (for example, in the form of an\naffidavit) from each of the Respondents and from each member of the House and Senate that he or she\naffirmatively chooses to assert legislative privilege and not provide documents and/or submit to a\ndeposition. AsRespondentsrecognize(MotiontoQuashat 12),thelegislativeprivilege isapersonalone\nand must be waivedor asserted by each individuallegislator. See, e.g. Almonte v. City of Long\nBeach,2005WL1796118,atn.2(E.D.N.Y.July27,2005).\n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 11 of 17 PageID #:589\napplicationoftherelevantfactors showsthatdiscoveryiswarrantedunderthesecircumstances.\nRespondents cite a number of cases for the proposition that “the legislative immunity\ndoctrine has been successfully invoked in a great many redistricting cases, including claims of\nintentional discrimination and violations of the Voting Rights Act.” Motion to Quash at 5-6.\nNoneofthecasescited byRespondentsarebindingontheCourt,mostareeasilydistinguishable,\nandtheanalysesintheremainderofthecases areunpersuasive.\nIn Cano v. Davis, 193 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1180-81 (C.D. Cal. 2002), the court addressed\nonly a narrow question not at issue here: whether a legislator who elected to waive his privilege\ncould also waivetheprivilegeofotherlegislators. Id. at 1179. Respondents’citation to footnote\n2 ofHispanicCoalitionon Reapportionmentv. Legislative ReapportionmentCommission, 536 F.\nSupp. 578 (E.D. Pa 1982), is puzzling because the cited footnote actually suggests that the\ndepositionwasallowed,butmadesubjecttoaprotectiveorderwhichlimiteditsscope.\nThe lack of analysis in other cases cited by Respondents renders those decisions of\nlimited use to the Court. See Chen v. City of Houston, NO. H-97-1180, Mem. Op. at 3-4 (S.D.\nTex Oct.31,1997);Gonzalezv.CityofAurora,NO.02C08346(N.D.Ill2003).\nPlaintiffs respectfully submit that a number of decisions cited by Respondents (including\nMartinez v. Bush, NO. 1:02-cv-20244 AJ, Mem. Op. (S.D. Fla. July 12, 2002); Gonzalez; and\nSimpson v. City of Hampton, 166 F.R.D. 16 (E.D. Va. 1996)) are unpersuasive, because the\ncourts there did not employ the necessary balancing test in determining that discovery on\nlegislators was unavailable. For the reasons discussed above, these decisions cannot be squared\nwith Supreme Court and other precedents that require courts to balance competing interests\nbefore allowing or precluding discovery. Those decisions holding to the contrary are neither\nbinding on this Court nor persuasive authority that the Court should follow. Further, Gonzaelz\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 12 of 17 PageID #:590\nand Simpson are inapt for the same reason that Bagley is—because they involve assertions of\nimmunity by legislator-defendants. See Gonzalez, Respondents’ Ex. C, at 2; Simpson, 166\nF.R.D.at17.\nIn their Motion, Respondents do not deny that they are in possession of evidence that is\nhighly relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims. While Plaintiffs are seeking to discover information from\nother sources, only Respondents will have direct evidence concerning their intentions in passing\nthe Plan. See Irvin, 127 F.R.D. at 171-173 (“evidence concerning the intent with which the\n[redistricting body] adopted the plan and rejected certain alternatives,” is highly-relevant and\nmay be developed through discovery against legislators.).13 Plaintiffs are entitled to pierce\nRespondents’qualifiedprivilege andobtain allresponsivedocumentsintheirpossession.\nIII. EvenifRespondentsWereShieldedByLegislativePrivilege,Muchofthe\nInformationSought Falls OutsidetheScopeof thePrivilege\nEven if the Court concludes that Respondents have an absolute legislative privilege, or\neven if the Court concludes that Respondents’ qualified privilege should not be pierced under\nthesecircumstances,Plaintiffs’arestillentitledto manycategoriesofdocuments called forinthe\nSubpoenas. Under any reading of the applicable caselaw, Respondents’ communications with\nthird parties and the objective facts on which Respondents’ relied to formulate the Plan are\ndiscoverable.\nFirst, Respondents have waived the privilege for all communications with parties outside\nof the General Assembly (including the DCCC and Democratic Members of Congress), or for\ndocuments shared with these third parties. See Motion to Compel at ¶¶ 19, 25 (citing Almonte v.\n13 As Respondents recognize (Motion to Quash at 11) plaintiffs in redistricting cases often have other\nsources to learn the intent of the legislature, such as from legislative history. No legislative history is\navailable to Plaintiffs here. While the Springfield Democrats passed resolutions in a propagandistic\nattempt to explain the new state legislative districts, see S.R. 249 and H.R. 385, 97th Ill. General\nAssembly (2011), they made no attempt to introduce legislative history to explain or justify the\nCongressionaldistricts—nodoubtbecausethereasoningforeachdistrictissecret,improper,orboth.\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 13 of 17 PageID #:591\nCity of Long Beach, 2005 WL 1971014, No. CV 04-4192, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, 2005); and\nother cases). As Plaintiff’s stated in their Motion to Compel, Respondents met with Democratic\nMembers of Congress on Saturday, May 21 to see drafts of their districts—documents shared at\nthisorsimilarmeetingsarediscoverable. Id.at¶19.\nIn a similar vein, Respondents’ own brief recognizes that legislative immunity “only\napplies to thoselegislators actingin their legislativecapacity.” Biblia Abierta v.Banks, 129 F.3d\n899,903(7thCir.1997)(emphasisadded);seeMotiontoQuashat4.14 Courtstakea“functional\napproach” to this question which “focuses on the nature of the duties with which a particular\ngovernment official has been lawfully entrusted.” Rateree v. Rockett, 852 F.2d 946, 950 (7th\nCir. 1988). But “[t]he Supreme Court has construed the legislative capacity narrowly, holding\nthatlegislativeimmunity‘doesnotprohibitinquiryinto activities thatarecasuallyorincidentally\nrelated to legislative affairs but nota part of the legislative process itself.’” Hansen v. Bennett,\n948 F.2d 397, 402 (7th Cir. 1991) (quoting Brewster,408 U.S. at 528)(emphasis supplied by\nSeventh Circuit)); see also Gravel, 408 U.S. at 625. “In so holding, the Court noted that it has\naccorded legislators absolute immunity only when they were voting on a resolution,speaking on\nlegislation or in a legislative hearing,or subpoenaing records for use in a legislative hearing.\nCases subsequent toBrewster,both in the Supreme Court and in this Circuit, have continued to\nlimit legislative immunity to these narrow functions.” Id. “[T]he government official seeking\nimmunity, therefore, has the burden of showing” that he was acting in a legislative capacity and\nis thereforeentitledtoimmunity. Rateree,852 F.2dat950.\nRespondents cite no case for the proposition that speaking with Democratic Members of\n14 The Biblia and Rateree cases (discussed in this section) concern legislative immunity from suit, not\nlegislative privilege fromdiscovery. However, forthereasons explainedabove, Respondents’ legislative\nimmunity is far stronger than the qualified legislative privilege that they enjoy. If liability for a\nlegislator’s act is not protected bylegislative immunity, see Biblia, 129 F.3d at 903, there is no reason to\nthinkthattheweakerlegislativeprivilegemightprotectinquiryintothatact.\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 14 of 17 PageID #:592\nCongress, consulting with the DCCC, or discussing redistricting with other outsiders are within\nthe“narrow” confinesof thelegislativeprivilege. Theyhavecertainlynot carriedtheirburdenof\nshowing that they were acting in their legislative capacities during those communications.\nIndeed, the Court in Pataki concluded that “conversation[s] between legislators and\nknowledgeable outsiders, such as lobbyists, to mark up legislation” would not fall within the\nscope of the privilege. 280 F. Supp. at 101; see also U.S. v. Williams, 644 F.2d 950 (2d Cir.\n1981) (immunity did not protect senator’s conversations with undercover FBI agent about\nproposedbill).15\nFurther, as Plaintiffs explained in their Motion, neither the legislative privilege nor the\ndeliberative process privilege protects the objective information (including voter and election\ndata) available to Respondents when they were preparing the Plan. See Motion to Compel at ¶¶\n18, 24 (citing Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at n.20; ACORN v. County of Nassau, 2009 WL\n2923435,at*4(E.D.N.Y.Sept.10,2009). No casecitedbyRespondentssuggestsotherwise.\nAgain, Plaintiffs repeat that in the event that the Court determines that Respondents are\nentitled to assert the legislative privilege, Defendants should not be permitted to offer evidence\nfrom Respondents in defense of this matter. “[O]ne cannot use aprivilegeas both ashieldand\nasword.” United AutoIns.Co.v.Veluchamy,747 F.Supp.2d1021,1030 (N.D. Ill.2010).\nIV. Respondents’OtherAssertionsofPrivilegeFail\nPlaintiffs established in their Motion to Compel the numerous flaws with Respondents’\nassertion of the deliberative process privilege. Respondents cite no case suggesting that\nlegislators—as opposed to members of the administrative/executive branch—can assert this\nprivilege. See United States v. Zingsheim, 384 F.3d 867, 872 (7th Cir. 2004); Kay, 2003 WL\n15Similarly,whilelegislative privilegedoesextendtolegislative aides,itonlyprotectsaidestotheextent\nthat they were acting in their legislative capacity. See Bagley, 646 F.3d at 396 (governor’s deputy chief\nofstaffcouldbequestionedonnon-legislativematters).\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 15 of 17 PageID #:593\n25294710, at *15. Further, Respondents have patently failed to make the document-by-\ndocument showing required to assert the privilege. Artfield Builders, Inc. v. Village of Buffalo\nGrove,1992 WL314185,at*1(N.D.Ill.Oct.26,1992).\nEven if the privilege were properly asserted and did apply, it would not apply to (1)\ndocuments or other communications received from or shared with third parties; and (2) “purely\nfactual material” like voter data. Motion to Compel at ¶¶ 24-25 (citing Howard v. City of\nChicago, 2006 WL 2331096, No. 03 C 8481, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 10, 2006) (deliberative\nprocess privilege can be waived); Enviro Tech Int’l v. Envt’l Prot. Agency, 371 F.3d 370, 375\n(7th Cir. 2004) (deliberative process privilege does not cover “purely factual material”).\nFurthermore, the deliberative process privilege, like the legislative privilege, is not absolute and\n“may be overcome where there is a sufficient showing of a particularized need to outweigh the\nreasons for confidentiality.” United States v. Farley, 11 F.3d 1385, 1389 (7th Cir. 1993). For\nthe reasons explained in the Motion to Compel, the application of the deliberative process\nprivilegeisinappropriate inthiscase.\nNext, Respondents’ assertion of the work-product doctrine is far too broad. Respondents\nassert that many documents sought by the subpoena were prepared “in anticipation of and as an\noutgrowth ofthe claims litigated againstredistrictingplans forthe pastfour decades.” Motion to\nQuash at 15. Many acts of the General Assembly are challenged; if Respondents’ view of the\nlaw were correct, the Assembly could claim protection for any document, because it somehow\nfearedthatlitigationovertheAssembly’s action mightensue.\nIn truth, the doctrine is much narrower and Respondents have the burden of establishing\nthe valid application of this protection on a document by document basis. Respondent have\nclearlynot metthis burden, nor can they. Workproductprivilege cannotbeinvolved unless “the\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 16 of 17 PageID #:594\ndocument can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of\nlitigation,” Binks Mfg. Co. v. National Presto Industries, Inc., 709 F.2d 1109, 1119 (7th Cir.\n1983) (emphasis in original), or because “some articulable claim, likely to lead to litigation, has\narisen.” Id. (emphasis added). Documents prepared in the ordinary course of business when\nthere is a “mere contingencythat litigation may result” are not protected. Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The documents sought by Plaintiffs here were created in the ordinary course of\nthelegislature’sbusiness,atatimewhen nolitigationloomed.\nNext,Respondentssuggestthatthecommunications oflegislativeaideswhohappentobe\nlawyers areprivileged. Hereagain,Respondents seekto expanda legitimateprivilegebeyondits\nreasonableboundaries. But“[a]communicationisnotprivilegedsimplybecause itismadebyor\nto a person who happens to be a lawyer.” United States v. Evans, 113 F.3d 1457, 1463 (7th Cir.\n1997). Instead, “the attorney-client privilege is limited to situations in which the attorney is\nacting as a legal advisor” and not in some other professional capacity, such as a business or\npoliticaladvisor. Rehlingv.CityofChicago,207 F.3d1009,1019(7thCir.2000). Todetermine\nwhether any communications with legislative aides are privileged in this case, Respondents must\nshow that the communications were made by the aids acting in a legal capacity. Id. As with\ntheirassertionofworkproductprivilege,Respondentshavesimplynot met theirburden.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 66 Filed: 09/27/11 Page 17 of 17 PageID #:595\nConclusion\nThis lawsuit challenges a pernicious gerrymander and seeks to vindicate Plaintiffs’\nconstitutional and statutory right to vote. There are no circumstances more appropriate than\nthese for piercing state legislators’ qualified protection from third-party discovery. Respondents\nhave subverted the democratic process to increase their chances of remaining in office; they\nshould not now be permitted to use that office as a shield against discovery. To grant\nRespondents’ motion would be to set a precedent that restrains plaintiffs from obtaining direct\nevidence of discrimination in voting rights cases, and frees legislators to engage in back room\nmachinations completely shielded from public view without fear of inquiry. The relief the\nSpringfield Democrats seek would put this kind of black box legislating beyond the reach of any\ncourt, even when as here, the federalism interest is at its lowest ebb in the face of a heightened\nfederal interest such as the vindication of rights pursuant to the VRA. Such a result is simply\nbeyond the pale and contrary to decades of well-established precedent. For these reasons, the\nCourt should deny Respondents’ Motion to Quash Subpoenas and for a Protective Order and\ngrantPlaintiffs’ MotiontoCompel.\nRespectfullySubmitted,\nDated: September27,2011 By:/s/LoriE.

Marshall,  along  with  supporting  exhibits,  and  to  limit  Marshall’s \ntestimony at the hearing.  In support of this motion, the Defendants state as follows:  \nINTRODUCTION\nOn Friday, November 4, 2011, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Permanent Injunction, in \nwhich they alleged that Public Act 97-14, which instituted a new Congressional district map \npursuant to the recent U.S. census (the “2011 Congressional districting map”), violated §2 of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, and was an unconstitutional racial and partisan \ngerrymander.   Attached to this Motion was the Affidavit of Edward D. Marshall, who was \nidentified  by  the  Plaintiffs  in  the  Pre-Hearing  Order  as  a  “may  call”  fact  witness.1   The \n                                                \n1 In their responses to the Defendants’ First Set of Interrogatories, the Plaintiffs also identified Marshall as an \nIndependent Contractor.  The Defendants chose not to depose Marshall only after confirming with the Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel in a letter dated September 22, 2011 that Marshall had provided the Plaintiffs solely with technical map \nconsulting services. \n\n  \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 115 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 2 of 7 PageID #:2343\nDefendants have simultaneously filed a Motion to Strike and Motion in Limine seeking to bar, in \npart, testimony in Marshall’s affidavit or exhibits that are related to the Partisan Voting Index.  \nDefendants file this additional Motion in Limine regarding other subjects in Marshall’s affidavit \nthat are either an improper attempt under FRE 701 to have a lay witness opine about expert \nanalysis or are testimony about exhibits to the affidavit that were never previously disclosed. \nTherefore, the Defendants respectfully request this Court to strike those portions of Marshall’s \naffidavit and accompanying exhibits that offer expert testimony or are untimely disclosures and \nto bar his testimony with regard to those same materials at the hearing on the Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Permanent Injunction. \nARGUMENT\nI.  The Portions of Marshall’s Affidavit that Offer Expert Testimony or which are \nUntimely Should be Stricken.     \nThis  Court  should  strike  those  segments  of  Marshall’s  Affidavit  and  accompanying \nexhibits that proffer opinion testimony or are untimely and, therefore, objectionable.   \nA.  Marshall,  as  a  Fact  Witness,  Cannot  Proffer  Opinion  Testimony  or \nSupporting Evidence.   \nWhen it came time to disclose their expert witnesses, the Plaintiffs never identified \nMarshall.  Instead, they listed him in their discovery responses as an Independent Contractor, and \nthen confirmed that statement in a subsequent letter with the Defendants’ counsel and again in \nthe Pre-Hearing Order.    Yet, now, the Plaintiffs are offering him up to provide, essentially, \nexpert opinions.   \nFact witnesses may speak to those facts that are in the witness’s first-hand knowledge.  \nU.S. v. York, 572 F.3d 415, 420 (7th Cir. 2009); Sunstar, Inc. v. Alberto-Culver Co., Inc., 2006 \nWL 6505615 (N.D. Ill. 2006), quoting U.S. v. Conn, 297 F.3d 548, 553-54 (7th Cir. 2002); see \n2  \n\n  \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 115 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:2344\nalso Ancho v. Pentek Corp., 157 F.3d 512, 515 and 519 (7th Cir. 1998).  However, an expert, \nusing his/her “scientific, technological, or other specialized knowledge,” may speak to opinions \nor inferences that are drawn from facts outside of his/her first-hand knowledge.  Id.; FRE 702.  \nSuch opinions are not admissible as lay testimony from a fact witness.  York, 572 F.3d at 420; \nFRE 701(c).  Furthermore, a party seeking to use an expert must timely disclose him/her, along \nwith  a  written  summary  of  his/her  opinion,  prior  to  trial.   York,  572  F.3d  at  420;  FRCP \n26(a)(2)(D).  \nWhile Marshall, as an employee of Illinois House Republican leader Tom Cross, has \naccess to census and demographic data, he is neither capable nor qualified to offer his opinion on \nthe meaning of such data.  Marshall acknowledges that he has provided technical support and \ntechnology consulting services in this and other redistricting matters, but nowhere does he \nindicate  that  he  has  the  educational  or  employment  background  to  analyze  the  data  he  is \nprocessing.   See Marshall Affidavit, ¶ 2 – 4.   Moreover, the Plaintiffs have never disclosed \nMarshall as an expert in analyzing geographic, demographic, census, or election data, let alone \nprior to the expert disclosure date set by the Court in its September 29, 2011 Agreed Order.  In \naddition,  Marshall’s  Affidavit  and  supporting  materials  are  the  first  written  report  that  the \nPlaintiffs have submitted to the Defendants in which he summarizes his opinion.  Thus, none of \nMarshall’s opinions and conclusions have been tested or allowed to be assessed and possibly \nrefuted by the Defendants’ experts.2   Marshall’s opinion testimony is, therefore, untimely and \nconstitutes an unfair surprise to the Defendants. \n                                                \n2 Even though this Motion in Limine focuses on the untimely and expert-oriented nature of Marshall’s Affidavit and \nsupporting exhibits, the Plaintiffs’ late disclosure also prejudices the Defendants in another way:  namely, that the \naccuracy of the facts in the Affidavit cannot be verified.  See, e.g., Marshall Affidavit, ¶ 37. \n3  \n\n \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 115 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 4 of 7 PageID #:2345\ni.  Since Marshall Does Not Qualify as an Expert, Those Opinions Based on \nInformation Outside of his First-Hand Knowledge Must be Stricken from \nhis Affidavit and Barred from Use at the Hearing.  \nThe Plaintiffs have offered no foundation to qualify Marshall as an expert in analyzing \nredistricting plans.  Rather, all that the Plaintiffs have offered are conclusory statements from an \nindividual who has processed data on their behalf.  Because Marshall’s Affidavit seeks to admit \nfacts that are beyond his first-hand knowledge, the Defendants seek to strike, in particular, the \nfollowing paragraphs of expert testimony:   \nStarting  with  ¶¶  14  and  15  of  the  Affidavit,  Marshall  inexplicably  decides  against \nadopting the Court’s description of the area connecting the two ends of Congressional District 4.  \nIn King, the Court determined that the area started and ended at Central Avenue.  King v. St. Bd. \nof Elec., 979 F.Supp. 582, 609, fn. 49 (N.D. Ill. 1996).  However, in ¶¶ 14 and 15, Marshall has \nunilaterally limited the area to reflect just a small portion of the area along I-294 and a bit further \nsouth.   This re-drawing of that connecting area constitutes undisclosed and unsubstantiated \nexpert opinion. \nMarshall also attempts to introduce analysis of the concentrations of Latino voting age \npopulation  (“VAP”)  in  Congressional  Districts  3,  4  and  5  under  the  2001  and  2011 \nCongressional districting maps.  Marshall Affidavit, ¶¶ 39 – 44.  The Plaintiffs never produced \nthese analytic maps during fact discovery, and certainly not as materials relied upon by their \nretained—and previously identified—experts Richard Engstrom and Peter Morrison.  In fact, the \nPlaintiffs initially disclosed Dr. Morrison as their expert to opine on the changes to the Latino \nVAP in the 2011 Congressional Map and the Plaintiffs’ proposed Congressional districting \nmaps.     Now, on the eve of the hearing, Plaintiffs are attempting to produce additional expert \nanalysis through a lay witness.  The Plaintiffs have not shown that Marshall is qualified to assess \n4  \n\n \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 115 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 5 of 7 PageID #:2346\npopulation concentrations, determine population cut-offs, or portray such analytical maps in \nproper perspective.  Moreover, the Plaintiffs have not provided the Defendants with the data that \nsupports Marshall’s Latino VAP analysis.   Paragraphs ¶¶ 39 – 44, along with the analysis found \nin ¶¶ 14 – 15, offer improper expert opinions and should be stricken from the Affidavit. \nii.  Since  Marshall  Does  Not  Qualify  as  an  Expert,  Those  Exhibits  that \nSupport  Unsubstantiated  Expert  Testimony  Must  be  Stricken  from  his \nAffidavit and Barred from Use at the Hearing.   \nSeveral exhibits are used as evidence to substantiate the opinions Marshall articulates \nwithin his Affidavit.  However, Marshall has been identified only as a lay witness, so he may \nspeak to no more than those facts within his first-hand knowledge.  As such, the Defendants seek \nto strike, in particular, the following exhibits from the Affidavit and to bar Plaintiffs from using \nor referencing these exhibits at the hearing.  \nFirst, Exhibits B11 and B12 (the Plaintiffs’ hearing exhibits P-71 and P-72, respectively) \nshould  be  stricken  as  supporting  improper  expert  opinion.   These  maps  are  not  accurate \nrepresentations of the area that connects the two core areas of Congressional District 4.  As noted \nabove, rather than adopting the geographic description authorized by the Court in King, Marshall \nhas  limited  the  area  based  on  his  own  analysis.   This  re-drawing  of  the  connecting  area \nconstitutes undisclosed and unsubstantiated expert opinion.   \nIn addition, Exhibits B28 – B33 (the Plaintiffs’ hearing exhibits P-88 – P-93) must be \nstricken as expert material.  As noted in the discussion of ¶¶ 39 – 44, supra, the Plaintiffs never \npreviously disclosed these analytic maps of the Latino VAP.   Now, the Plaintiffs are using \nMarshall as a means to introduce evidence that was previously lacking from their expert’s \nargument.   However, Marshall was never disclosed as an expert and has not been shown as \nqualified to draw such maps or determine population concentrations or cut-offs.   Ultimately, \n5  \n\n \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 115 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 6 of 7 PageID #:2347\nMarshall is not eligible to opine on matters outside of his first-hand knowledge, and those \nexhibits that support his unqualified opinions, such as Exhibits B11 – B12 and B28 – B33, \nshould be stricken as improper. \nB.  The Exhibits Attached to Marshall’s Affidavit Were Not Timely Disclosed.   \nNot  only  are  several  paragraphs  of,  and  exhibits  attached  to,  Marshall’s  Affidavit \nobjectionable because they elicit expert testimony from a lay witness, but all of the exhibits are \nalso untimely disclosed.  The Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Permanent Injunction on November \n4, 2011, which was the first time that they disclosed the Marshall Affidavit and its supporting \nexhibits to the Defendants.  This is a clear violation of the standard rules of discovery—and this \nCourt’s Agreed Order of September 29, 2011—and the Plaintiffs should be barred from relying \nupon such evidence at the hearing. \nII.  Marshall’s  Testimony  at  the  Hearing  Should  be  Limited  to  His  First-Hand \nKnowledge.    \nWhile  striking  the  opinion  and  untimely  testimony  from  Marshall’s  Affidavit  and \nsupporting exhibits will ensure that the Defendants are not prejudiced by late and unsubstantiated \nexpert testimony and supporting materials, the Defendants request that this Court also limit \nMarshall’s testimony at trial to only those matters of which he has first-hand knowledge.  The \nDefendants do not challenge the authenticity of the Plaintiffs’ documents.  Also, the Defendants \ndo not object to the Plaintiffs calling Marshall as a fact witness.   However, Marshall had not \nbeen previously proffered as an expert who, using his “scientific, technical, or other specialized \nknowledge,” can testify to the implications and uses of such census and demographic data.  FRE \n701(c); FRE 702.  It would be improper for the Plaintiffs to now elicit his testimony on such \nexpert opinion at trial. \n6  \n\n               \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 115 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 7 of 7 PageID #:2348\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, the Defendants respectfully request this Court to strike the portions of \nMarshall’s Affidavit that offer expert testimony as well as bar Marshall, a fact witness, from \noffering testimony on those matters.  Specifically, the Defendants seek to strike the following \nexpert testimony from Marshall’s Affidavit: \n¶¶ 14 – 15 \n¶ 37 \n¶¶ 39 – 44  \nAdditionally, the Defendants seek to strike the following exhibits from Marshall’s Affidavit as \nunsubstantiated expert material, and to bar these exhibits’ use at the hearing: \nB11 – B 12 (the Plaintiffs’ hearing exhibits P-71 – P-72) \nB28 – B33 (the Plaintiffs’ hearing exhibits P-88 – P-93)  \nLikewise,  the  Defendants  seek  to  strike  all  of  the  exhibits  due  to  the  Plaintiffs’  untimely \ndisclosure of those materials.  Furthermore, the Defendants request that this Court bar Marshall \nfrom testifying on all of the above identified matters and materials and limit his testimony to just \nthose facts of which he has first-hand knowledge.  \nDated:  November 10, 2011   Respectfully submitted, \nTHE ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.         \n                    /s/ Brent Stratton                          \n                   Attorney for Defendants                           \nBrent D.

OntheeveningofOctober4,theDefendants\nprovided the Plaintiffs with a series of reports by their experts, Allan J. Lichtman and Gerald R.\nWebster, that (1) rely extensively on data provided by staff of the Office of the Illinois Speaker\nof the House of Representatives—the very same body that has refused to produce any\ninformation to the Plaintiffs on the ground of legislative “immunity”; and (2) fault the Plaintiffs\nfor failing to provide evidence of Respondents’ discriminatory intent, which is exactly what the\nPlaintiffs seek from the Respondents through their Subpoenas. As explained below, the expert\nreports show precisely why the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel [Dkt. 52] and\ndeny the Respondents’ Motion to Quash and for a Protective Order [Dkt. 58]. In the alternative,\ntheCourtshouldstriketheexpertreports intheirentirety.\n1\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 70 Filed: 10/06/11 Page 2 of 35 PageID #:641\nIn their reports, Lichtman and Webster disclose that they obtained and relied on\ninformation provided by Respondents. In one of his reports, Lichtman states, “The election and\ndemographic data and the racial identification of candidates were obtained from the staff of the\nRedistricting Office of the Illinois Speaker of the House of Representatives.”1 See Lichtman\nResp. to Engstrom, at ¶ 6 (Ex. A). In another report, Lichtman states that all of the “data and\nmaps” on which he relied “were obtained from the staff of the Redistricting Office of the Illinois\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives.” See Lichtman Resp. to Morrison at ¶ 10 (Ex. B); see\nalso id. at ¶ 14 n.1 (providing results of calculations performed on “data provided by the Illinois\nRedistricting Office”). And Lichtman’s third report expressly states that the data he uses is\ndescribed in his other two reports. Lichtman Rep. at 4 (Ex. C). Finally, the Defendants’ other\nexpert, Webster, likewise acknowledges that “Congressional district shape files for the 1990s,\n2000s, and the 2011 Adopted Plan provided by the staff of the Redistricting Office of the\nSpeaker of the Illinois House of representatives” were among the “facts or data relied upon in\nreaching[his]conclusions.” WebsterRep.at3(Ex.D).\nAs the Court is aware, the Office of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives\nis one of the parties to whom Plaintiffs’ Subpoenas were directed, and that Office has refused to\nproduceanymaps,data, orotherdocumentswhatsoeveronthegroundoflegislative“immunity.”\nNow, however, it appears that the Officer of the Speaker is funneling cherry-picked information\ntotheDefendants’expertsinanefforttorebutPlaintiffs’allegationsandexpertevidence.\nAdding insult to injury, Lichtman faults the Plaintiffs for failing to present “any direct or\nindirect evidence that decision-makers feared that the white majority’s preferred candidates\nwould be defeated by the candidates of choice for Latino voters.” Lichtman Rep. at 7 (Ex. C).\n1 Before receiving Lichtman’s reports, Plaintiffs were unaware that Speaker Madigan’s office even\ncontainedastand-alone“RedistrictingOffice.”\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 70 Filed: 10/06/11 Page 3 of 35 PageID #:642\nYet such evidence of the decision-makers intent is precisely what the Subpoena Respondents\nswore was irrelevant to the case and privileged from discovery. Indeed, counsel for the\nRespondents insisted that the Court’s analysis would be “an expert-driven, data-driven process.”\nTranscript of September 29, 2011 Proceedings at 15:10-18 (Ex. E).2 Lichtman’s report confirms\nthatRespondents werewrongand that evidenceof legislativeintent is a central elementof proof.\nSee, e.g. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,429 U.S. 252, 265-268 (1977)\n(“Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. * * * Determiningwhetherinvidious discriminatorypurposewas a motivating\nfactor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may\nbeavailable.”).3 BycriticizingthePlaintiffsfornotpresentingevidenceoflegislators’intent,the\nDefendants seek to improperly use the legislative privilege as a “sword” to prejudice the\nPlaintiffs’case.\nThe Defendants should not be permitted to use the legislative and deliberative process\nprivileges “as both ashieldand asword.” United Auto Ins. Co. v. Veluchamy, 747 F. Supp. 2d\n1021, 1030 (N.D. Ill. 2010). As such, the Respondents should not be permitted to claim\nprivilege over broad swaths of information, while the Defendants simultaneously and selectively\nuse information from the Respondents in making their defense and fault the Plaintiffs for not\nhaving such information. See Robinson v. Morgan Stanley, No. 06-cv-5158, 2010 WL 1050288,\nat *6 (N.D. Ill. March 17, 2010) (“[a] defendant may not use the privilege to prejudice his\n2 Counsel for the Democratic Congressional Candidate Committee (“DCCC”) has likewise argued to the\nU.S. District Court fortheDistrict ofColumbiathat the Panel had not even determinedwhether evidence\nof the intent behind the passage of the Plan (which Plaintiffs are also seeking from the DCCC) was\nrelevant.Thetranscriptofthishearingisnotyetavailable.\n3SeealsoGarzav.CountyofLosAngeles,918F.2d763,770-771(9thCir.1990)(plaintiffmayestablish\nviolationofVotingRightsActbyprovingintentionaldiscriminationonthepartofthelegislature).\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 70 Filed: 10/06/11 Page 4 of 35 PageID #:643\nopponent’s case or to disclose some selected communications for self-serving purposes”)).4 Yet\nthat is what the Respondents and the Defendants are doing. Lichtman’s report relies on selected\n“data” and “maps” provided by the Respondents to support the Defendants’ claim that the\nCongressional Plan passes muster, and Lichtman criticizes the Plaintiffs for supposedlyfailingto\npresent intent evidence. At the same time, however, the Respondents refuse to produce any\nevidence to the Plaintiffs about the creation and adoption of the Plan. These litigation tactics are\nimproperandunfair.\nAtthehearingonthependingmotions,JudgeTinderagreedthatthePlaintiffs “do makea\ngood point that to the extent they resist your opponents and third parties resist disclosing certain\nthings, they can’t then bring that witness in to testify.” 9/29/11 Tr. at 24:24-25:2 (Ex. E).\nInstead of apprising the Plaintiffs and the Court that the Respondents were then in the process of\nsharing data and other information with the Defendants’ experts, counsel for the Respondents\nstated at the hearing that “I think it’s a little early for motions in limine.” Id. at 28:15-16. That\nlack of candor was improper. And certainly it is no longer too early to bar the Defendants from\nrelyingonanyinformationobtainedfromtheRespondents.\nIndeed, it would be fundamentallyunfair to allow the Respondents to selectivelydisclose\ndocuments that help the Defendants’ case, while simultaneously allowing the Respondents to\nrefuse to produce any other documents on privilege grounds. It is for this reason that the\nintentional disclosure of an otherwise privileged document waives the privilege as to other\ndocuments that concern the same subject matter. See Lerman v. Turner, 2011 WL 494623, at *2\n(N.D. Ill. Feb. 4, 2011) (Lefkow, J.) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 502(a)).

Ill. Nov. 4, 2010) (quoting Charles Alan Wright et al.,Federal\nPractice and Procedure vol. 8, § 2016.2 (3d ed. 1995, Suppl. 2010)), and when “fairness\nrequires a further disclosure of related, protected information, in order to prevent a selective and\nmisleading presentation of evidence to the disadvantage of the adversary.” Id.5 The\nRespondents should not be permitted to disclose cherry-picked materials that they consider\nhelpful to the defense of the Congressional Plan, and yet assert privilege over other documents\nthat they would rather not produce. Having voluntarily injected “data” and “maps” into the\nlitigation byproviding it to the Defendants’ experts, the Respondents have opened themselves to\nall of thediscoverysought in theSubpoenas. SeePowellv. Ridge, 247 F.3d 520, 525-26 (3d Cir.\n2001) (refusing to recognize a doctrine of “partial legislative immunity,” that would allow\nlegislatorstoactivelyparticipateinthelitigationwhilerefusingtoprovidediscovery).\nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the Plaintiffs’ prior filings on this subject,\nthe Plaintiffs ask that the Court grant Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel [Dkt. 52] and deny the\nRespondents’ Motion to Quash and for a Protective Order [Dkt. 59]. In the alternative, the\nPlaintiffs ask that the Court strike the Defendants’ expert reports in their entirety, because they\nrelyon cherry-pickeddataanddocuments providedbytheRespondents.\n5 While Rule 502(a) concerns the attorney-client and work product privileges, there is no reason whythe\n“fairness” concerns underlying the rule are not equally applicable in this context.

In \nsupport, Defendants state as follows:   \nOn September 19, 2011, Plaintiffs disclosed Richard Engstrom and Peter Morrison as \ntheir  experts.   Neither  the  reports  submitted  by  Engstrom  and  Morrison  nor  any  of  their \ndeposition testimony offered opinions on the merits of Plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymander claims \nunder the First Amendment or Equal Protection Clause (Counts V and VI).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ \nexperts should be barred from offering any opinion on the partisan gerrymander claims at the \nhearing in this matter. \n\n \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 119 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:2362\nAs  part  of  the  proposed  pre-trial  disclosures  filed  on  November  7,  2011,  Plaintiffs \nsubmitted an exhibit list containing dozens of exhibits that were neither referenced nor relied \nupon  by  Plaintiffs’  experts,  either  in  their  reports  previously  disclosed  pursuant  to  FRCP \n26(a)(2),  or  during  their  depositions.   These  unreferenced  exhibits  fall  into  four  general \ncategories:  (a) PVI maps first designed by lay-witness Edward D. Marshall to support Plaintiffs’ \npartisan gerrymander claims; (b) Latino voting age population (“VAP”) maps first designed by \nlay-witness Edward D. Marshall to support Plaintiffs’ racial gerrymander claims; (c) scholarly \narticles; and (d) third party e-mails, legislative transcripts and documents regarding Illinois \npoliticians.  These materials are now untimely produced, and Plaintiffs’ counsel did not confirm \nprior to the filing of this motion that their experts would not seek to opine or comments on any of \nthese exhibits.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ exhibits include analytic maps in support of their partisan gerrymander \nclaims created by Marshall, a non-expert witness.  His maps purport to show how districts and \ncities in the Adopted Plan fare under the Partisan Voting Index (“PVI”), a methodology Marshall \nused to derive PVI scores for each of the districts.  (See P-80 to P-87 listed in [Proposed] Pre-\nHearing Order, Dkt 108 at 12 of 23).     In his affidavit, Marshall states that the PVI index \npurports to measure the success of a Republican or Democratic candidate in a district.  Plaintiffs \nhave also included as exhibits a report and almanac definition regarding the PVI index. (Dkt 108 \nat 10-11 of 23: P-44, P-53).  Plaintiffs’ experts should be barred from testifying regarding these \nPVI exhibits or offering any testimony on PVI, as the partisan gerrymander claims and PVI \nexhibits were not a subject of their expert reports or testimony.  (Defendants have simultaneously \nfiled Motion in Limine #1 to bar any references to PVI in the permanent injunction motion and at \nhearing, but were any part of that motion to be denied, Plaintiffs’ experts should be barred from \n2\n\n \nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 119 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:2363\ntestifying regarding the PVI index.)   \nSecond,  Plaintiffs’  exhibits  include  analytic  maps  purporting  to  describe  the \nconcentrations of Latino population in various parts and districts of Cook County under the 2001 \nCongressional Map and 2011 Adopted Map.  (Dkt 108 at 12 of 23: P-88 to P-93).  These maps \nare offered in support of the racial gerrymander and dilution claims, but were first disclosed only \non November 4, 2011, when they were attached to Marshall’s affidavit, which itself was filed in \nsupport of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Permanent Injunction.  In his affidavit, Marshall states that he \ncreated these maps.   Plaintiffs, however, had previously disclosed Morrison only as their expert \nto opine about changes in the allocation of Latino population from one map to another.  Now, on \nthe eve of trial, Plaintiffs are attempting to supplement Morrison’s expert opinion through a lay \nwitness Marshall.  Plaintiffs’ experts Morrison and Engstrom should be barred from testifying \nabout  these  maps  as  they  were  not  part  of  their  expert  reports  or  deposition  testimony.  \n(Defendants have simultaneously filed a Motion in Limine #2 to bar these analytic maps from \nbeing introduced into evidence or testified to by Marshall).    \nThird,  Plaintiffs’  exhibits  include  articles  and  studies  regarding  the  socioeconomic \nconditions of Latinos. (Dkt 108 at 10-11 of 23:   P-42 to P-43, P-45 to P-52, P-54-to P-55).  \nWhile Plaintiffs produced these articles and studies to Defendants either on October 19 or 26,  \n2011, Morrison and Engstrom did not comment on any of these studies or articles in their \nrebuttal reports filed on October 18, 2011 and they were not the subject of their deposition \ntestimony.

No. 52] and certain non-parties’ motion to quash subpoenas and for a protective\norder [Dkt. No. 58].  The motions raise legislative privilege issues rarely addressed by the courts\nbecause they pertain to the redistricting activity that follows each decennial census.  For this\nreason, this opinion is more lengthy than the typical ruling on discovery issues.\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 2 of 23 PageID #:709\nBACKGROUND\nThe United States Constitution requires Illinois lawmakers to redraw the state’s\ncongressional district boundaries after each decennial census.  U.S. CONST. ART. I,  § 2; id.\namend. XIV, §§ 1 & 2; id. AMEND. XV; Ryan v. State Bd. of Elections of State of Ill., 661 F.2d\n1130, 1132 (7th Cir. 1981).  Pursuant to this authority, the Illinois General Assembly drafted,\ndebated, and passed the Illinois Congressional Redistricting Act of 2011 (the “Redistricting\nAct”) (P.A. 97-14).  The Redistricting Act eliminates one congressional seat, as required by the\n2010 United States Census results, and establishes boundaries for the state’s eighteen remaining\ncongressional districts.  \nBeginning on March 28, 2011, and continuing through May 2, 2011, members of the\nIllinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate held a series of public hearings at\nlocations around the state where members of the public were allowed to comment on the\nredistricting process.  See 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 125/10-5.  On May 27, 2011, the Democratic\nleadership of the Illinois House and Senate Redistricting Committees released the congressional\nredistricting plan (“2011 Map”) on its website.  Three days later, the Illinois House of\nRepresentatives passed the Redistricting Act, and the next day the Illinois Senate followed suit. \nOn June 24, 2011, the Governor signed the Redistricting Act into law, and the present litigation\nensued.   \nThe plaintiffs comprise three groups: The Committee for a Fair and Balanced Map, a not-\nfor-profit organization created by Illinois citizens concerned about the congressional redistricting\nprocess in Illinois; nine Republican Congressmen and one Republican Congresswoman; and six\nregistered voters, four of whom are identified as Latino and two as Republican (collectively\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 3 of 23 PageID #:710\n“plaintiffs”).  The defendants include the Illinois State Board of Elections, the agency charged\nwith implementing the 2011 Map, and its individual members (collectively “defendants”).\nPlaintiffs allege that the 2011 Map discriminates against Latino and Republican voters,\nand they seek to invalidate the redistricting plan in whole or in part.  Specifically, plaintiffs\nallege that the 2011 Map violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (“VRA”)\n(Count I), the Fourteenth Amendment (Count II) and the Fifteenth Amendment (Count III) by\ndiluting the voting strength of Latino voters.  Plaintiffs also claim that the 2011 Map constitutes\nan impermissible racial gerrymander in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count IV) and a\npartisan gerrymander in violation the First Amendment (Count V) and Fourteenth Amendment\n(Count VI).  \nThe parties have engaged in expedited discovery.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 45, plaintiffs served thirty subpoenas duces tecum1 on a number of non-party entities\nand individuals, including the (i) Illinois House of Representatives (through Tim Mapes, Chief\nof Staff); (ii) Office of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives (through Tim Mapes,\nChief of Staff); (iii) Illinois House Redistricting Committee (through Barbara Flynn Currie,\nChairperson); (iv) Illinois Senate (through Jillayne Rock, Secretary of the Senate); (v) Office of\nthe Senate President (through Andrew Manar, Chief of Staff); (vi) Illinois Senate Redistricting\nCommittee (through Kwame Raoul, Chairperson); and (vii) various legislative staffers with\nknowledge of the reapportionment scheme (collectively “Non-Parties”).  The subpoenas contain\n1 The United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois issued twenty-five of the\nthirty subpoenas served by plaintiffs because most of subpoenaed witnesses reside in Springfield, Illinois. \nThe remaining five subpoenas were issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nIllinois.  According to Non-Parties, the Northern District of Illinois subpoenas capture all of the\ndocuments within the scope of the Central District of Illinois subpoenas, including those possessed by the\nIllinois House and Senate Redistricting Committees and individual staff members. \n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 4 of 23 PageID #:711\ntwenty-one requests for production encompassing documents and communications related to the\n2011 Map.  Non-Parties refused to comply with plaintiffs’ requests, claiming that legislative\nimmunity, the deliberative process privilege, the attorney-client privilege and/or the work-\nproduct doctrine protect the documents from disclosure.     \nOn September 15, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion to compel enforcement of the third party\nsubpoenas.  The next day, the President of the Illinois Senate, the Speaker of the Illinois House\nof Representatives, and the chairpersons of the Illinois House and Senate Redistricting\nCommittees moved to quash.  Each party was allowed to file a response and this three-judge\ncourt heard arguments on September 29, 2011. \nANALYSIS\nI.   Relevance of Requested Discovery\nPlaintiffs have served Non-Parties with twenty-one document requests. \nA. Requested Documents\nPlaintiffs seek a plethora of documents concerning the planning, development,\nnegotiation, and drawing of the 2011 Map.2  These documents can be broadly categorized as \n2 Plaintiffs’ document requests include:\n1. All documents related to the state of Illinois legislative and/or congressional redistricting\nprocess which led to the planning, development, negotiation, drawing, revision or re-\ndrawing of the 2011 Map.\n2.

All documents, communications or other matter, including all data files or other data type\nrelated to election and/or voter data; election redistricting software; and all 2010 Census\ndata used for the purpose of planning and drawing the 2011 Map or any other potential\ncongressional plan that was not adopted. \n5. All documents, communications or other matter, that constitute, refer or relate to data\nfiles and drafts of data files used to formulate the composition of Districts 3, 4, 5 of the\n2011 Map.\n6. Any draft drawings of any Districts of the 2011 Map.\n7. All documents which reflect the identity of any and all persons who assisted in the\ndrawing of Districts 3, 4, and 5 of the 2011 Map.\n8.

All documents which reflect the identity of person(s) who made or participated in the\ndecision to have the Latino VAP in District 5 as 16.05%.\n12. All documents which reflect the identity of any expert or consultant who reviewed,\ncommented on, advised or otherwise rendered any advice or opinion concerning the 2011\nMap.\n13.

All documents which consist of reports or opinions of any expert or consultant used to\nsupport the composition of the entire 2011 Map. \n17. All documents which reflect any and all analysis concerning the viability of drawing two\nLatino congressional Districts, whether the Districts be considered majority or influence\ndistricts.\n18. Any engagement letters provided to experts or consultants engaged for the purposes of\nplanning, preparing, drawing, and analyzing or providing supporting evidence for the\n2011 Map.\n19. All records of payment to any experts or consultants.\n20.

Relevancy of Requested Documents\nUnder Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties may obtain discovery of\nany nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense.  Plaintiffs make six\nclaims related to the 2011 Map.  See Compl. ¶¶ 108–38.  Proof of discriminatory intent is\nrequired for plaintiffs to prevail on their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment racial\ndiscrimination claims.7  It has also been found sufficient, though not necessary, to sustain a VRA\nclaim.  See United States v. Irvin, 127 F.R.D. 169, 171 (C.D. Cal. 1989) (after the 1982\namendments to the VRA, “plaintiffs may carry their burden by fulfilling either the more\nrestrictive intent test or the results test”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); accord\nGarza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 1990).\n2(...continued)\nthe Illinois Senate website during the early morning hours of May 27, 2011. \n3See Req. Nos. 1–6, 8, 14–17. [Doc. No. 52-1.]\n4See Req. Nos. 7, 9–11, 20–21. [Doc. No. 52-1.]\n5See Req. Nos. 12–13, 18–19. [Doc. No. 52-1.]\n6 See Req. Nos. 2 & 4. [Doc. No. 52-1.]\n7 The test for plaintiffs’ partisan gerrymandering claims is unsettled.  See Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541\nU.S. 267, 124 S. Ct. 1769, 158 L. Ed. 2d 546 (2004).\n6\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:714\nTo demonstrate intentional discrimination, however, plaintiffs need not offer direct\nevidence of discriminatory intent.  Direct evidence includes statements made by the decision\nmaking body or members thereto.  See, e.g., ACORN  v. County of Nassau, No. 05-2301,\n2007 WL 2815810, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2007) (ACORN I) (“testimony regarding a\nlegislator’s stated motivation might be the most direct form of evidence” of discriminatory\nintent.)  Instead, plaintiffs may rely on circumstantial evidence to show that lawmakers\npurposefully discriminated against Latino and/or Republican voters in enacting the 2011 Map. \nSee Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1406 (7th Cir. 1984) (“In Rogers, the [Supreme] Court\naffirmed the district court’s finding of intentional discrimination based on indirect and\ncircumstantial evidence and endorsed its reliance on a ‘totality of the circumstances’ approach.”)\n(citing Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 622–27, 102 S. Ct. 3272, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (1982)).\nFor example, to evaluate claims of racial vote dilution under the Fourteenth Amendment,\ncourts rely on the totality of the circumstances test.  See Rogers, 458 U.S. at 618.  Under this\ntest, courts may infer discriminatory intent from a variety of circumstantial factors.  These\nfactors include, but are not limited to, bloc voting along racial lines; low minority voter\nregistration; exclusion from the political process; unresponsiveness of elected officials to needs\nof minorities; and depressed socio-economic status attributable to inferior education and\nemployment and housing discrimination.  Ketchum, 740 F.2d at 1406 (citing Rogers, 458 U.S. at\n622–27).  Other factors include the historical background of the decision; the specific sequence\nof events leading up to the challenged decision; departures from the normal procedural sequence;\nminority retrogression (i.e. a decrease in the voting strength of a cohesive voting bloc over time);\nand manipulation of district boundaries to adjust the relative size of minority groups, including\n7\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:715\nthe “packing” of minority voters.  See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 267–68, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977); Rybicki v. State Bd. of\nElections, 574 F. Supp. 1082, 1108–12 (N.D. Ill. 1982).  Thus, under the totality of the\ncircumstances test, the court may infer an “invidious discriminatory purpose . . . from the totality\nof the relevant facts,” including the discriminatory effect of the redistricting scheme.  Rogers,\n458 U.S. at 618 (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs allege many of these circumstantial factors in their Complaint.  See Compl. ¶¶\n38–45 (events leading up to enactment); ¶ 60 (history of discrimination); ¶¶ 52–54 (manipulating\ndistrict boundaries); ¶ 57 (racial polarization of elections).  Yet many of plaintiffs’ document\nrequests solicit direct, not circumstantial, evidence of legislative intent, by demanding\ndocuments that contain communications between lawmakers and their staff.  See, e.g., Req. Nos.\n1–5 & 8.  These documents are likely to contain the motives, impressions and/or opinions of\nthose responsible for drafting the 2011 Map.  Other requests seek the identities of those who\nmade or participated in key decisions, suggesting an attempt by plaintiffs to gain insight to the\nthought processes of these individuals, if not now, then perhaps later through depositions.  See,\ne.g., Req. Nos. 7, 9–13.   \nTo be sure, statements made by members of the decision-making body are relevant to\nshow discriminatory intent.  See Village of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268.  But this is but\none factor among many that plaintiffs may use to prove their claims.  As acknowledged by the\nSupreme Court, \nInquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a hazardous matter.  When the\nissue is simply the interpretation of legislation, the Court will look to statements by\nlegislators for guidance as to the purpose of the legislature, because the benefit to\nsound  decision-making  in  this  circumstance  is  thought  sufficient  to  risk  the\n8\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:716\npossibility of misreading Congress’ purpose.  It is entirely a different matter when\nwe are asked to void a statute that is, under well-settled criteria, constitutional on its\nface, on the basis of what fewer than a handful of Congressmen said about it. What\nmotivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what\nmotivates scores of others to enact it, and the stakes are sufficiently high for us to\neschew guesswork.\nHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 228, 105 S. Ct. 1916, 85 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985) (quoting\nUnited States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383–84, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 1682–1683, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672\n(1968)); see also Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 224, 91 S. Ct. 1940, 29 L. Ed. 2d 438\n(1971) (“no case in this Court has held that a legislative act may violate equal protection solely\nbecause of the motivations of the men who voted for it”); Hispanic Coalition on\nReapportionment v. Legislative Reapportionment Comm., 536 F. Supp 578, 586 (D. Pa. 1982)\n(holding that discriminatory statements made by the chairman of a city redistricting committee\nwere insufficient to prove discriminatory intent absent a showing that the state legislative body\nadopted the chairman’s views).  Thus, the individual motivations and objectives of those who\ndrafted the 2011 Map, although relevant, are not critical to the outcome of this case.\nThe remainder of plaintiffs’ document requests pertain to facts, plans, reports or\nprocedures created, formulated or used by lawmakers to draft the 2011 Map.  Objective facts,\nsuch as United States Census reports and election returns, are highly relevant to plaintiffs’ claims\nand necessary to prove many of the totality of the circumstances factors, including racial bloc\nvoting, retrogression and manipulation of district boundaries.  The actual facts upon which\nlawmakers relied, however, are less relevant because they say little as to whether the overall\neffect of the 2011 Map is discriminatory.  Lawmakers may have considered a lot of facts and\ndrawn a discriminatory map, or considered no facts and drawn a perfectly constitutional map. \nThe proof, so they say, is in the pudding; and the pudding is the 2011 Map. \n9\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:717\nFinally, to the extent that the plans, reports and procedures used by lawmakers to draw\nthe 2011 Map shed light on the sequence of events leading up to its enactment, this information\nmay be relevant to plaintiffs’ claims.  The most important events, however, are those undertaken\nby the legislative body, such as public hearings, committee meetings and floor debates.  The\ndeliberations of individual lawmakers, even those who helped draw the 2011 Map, are less\nprobative of the totality of the circumstances test.  Nevertheless, because most of plaintiffs’\nrequests seek material relevant within Rule 26, the court will consider whether any of these\ndocuments are privileged from disclosure.    \nII. Identification of Nonprivileged Matter\nThe issue before this court is the extent to which legislative immunity shields non-party\nstate lawmakers from providing evidence in a civil lawsuit related to their legislative activities. \nPlaintiffs argue that the privilege is qualified and narrow.  Non-Parties argue that it is absolute.\nA.   Absolute Legislative Immunity\nThe Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution grants federal lawmakers\nabsolute legislative immunity from civil suit for their legitimate legislative activities. The Clause\nstates that “for any Speech or Debate in either House,” Senators and Representatives “shall not\nbe questioned in any other Place.”  U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 6, cl. 1.  When applied, this provision\nshields federal lawmakers “engaged in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity” from being\nsued for prospective relief or damages.  Supreme Ct. of Va. v. Consumers Union of U.S.,\n446 U.S. 719, 732, 100 S. Ct. 1967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1980) (quoting Tenney v. Branhove,\n341 U.S. 367, 376, 71 S. Ct. 783, 95 L. Ed. 1019 (1951)).  It also mandates an evidentiary\nprivilege that  prevents the legislative acts of a member of Congress from being used against him\n10\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 11 of 23 PageID #:718\nor her in court.  See United States v. Helstoski, 442 U.S. 477, 488–89, 99 S. Ct. 2432, 61 L. Ed.\n2d 12 (1979).  Finally, it provides a testimonial privilege that protects a member or the member’s\naides from judicial questioning regarding the member’s legislative acts.  Gravel v. United States,\n408 U.S. 606, 616, 92 S. Ct. 2614, 33 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1972).  “In sum, the Speech or Debate\nClause prohibits inquiry . . . into those things generally said or done in the House or the Senate\nin the performance of official duties and into the motivation for those acts.”  United States v.\nBrewster, 408 U.S. 501, 512, 92 S. Ct. 2531, 33 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1972).\nThe Speech or Debate Clause, by its terms, does not apply at all to state and local\nlegislators.  See, e.g., Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Fac., Inc. v. State of Fla. Dep’t of Health & Rehab.\nServs., 164 F.R.D. 257, 266 (N.D. Fla. 1995).  Instead, the federal common law applies.8 \nApplying the federal common law, the Supreme Court in Tenney held that members of a state\nlegislative committee were immune from civil liability for allegedly violating an individual’s\ncivil rights by calling him before the committee to testify in an effort to interfere with his First\nAmendment rights.  341 U.S. at 376–77.  Since Tenney, it is clear that under the federal common\nlaw “state and local officials are absolutely immune from federal suit for personal damages for\ntheir legitimate legislative activities.”  Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Blagojevich, 638 F.3d\n519, 527 (7th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted), partially vacated and decided on unrelated grounds\nby Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 651 F3d 799 (7th Cir. 2011); see\nalso Tenney, 341 U.S. at 376–77.  This immunity also extends to “legislative staff members,\nofficers, or other employees of a legislative body, although it is considered less absolute as\n8 This case presents federal questions and therefore the federal common law applies.

R.\nEvid. 501; see generally 3 WEINSTEIN’S EVIDENCE § 501.02[2][b][i] (1997) (in federal question cases,\nfederal privilege law, rather than the privilege law of the forum state, generally applies).\n11\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:719\napplied to these individuals.” Marylanders for Fair Representation, Inc. v. Schaefer, 144 F.R.D.\n292, 298 (D. Md. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nThe scope of the federal common law is not entirely settled, however.  The Supreme\nCourt has held that in a federal criminal prosecution, a state legislator did not have an absolute\nevidentiary privilege based in legislative immunity from introduction of evidence of his\nlegislative acts.  United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 373, 100 S. Ct. 1185, 63 L. Ed. 2d 454\n(1980).  Gillock carved out an exception from Tenney, reasoning that “the cases in this court\nwhich have recognized an immunity from civil suit for state officials have presumed the\nexistence of federal criminal liability as a restraining factor on the conduct of state officials.” \n445 U.S. at 372.  See Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Fac., Inc, 164 F.R.D. at 267 (“legislators and some of\ntheir staff members may be immune to civil process in a suit directly against them . . . [but this\nimmunity] is not an evidentiary privilege”).  \nSince Gillock, a number of courts have “rejected the notion that the common law\nimmunity of state legislators gives rise to a general evidentiary privilege.”  Manzi v. DiCarlo,\n982 F. Supp. 125, 129 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (citations omitted); see Cano v. Davis, 193 F. Supp. 2d\n1177, 1180 (C.D. Cal. 2002) (“state legislators do not enjoy the type of absolute protection\nafforded members of the Congress under the Speech or Debate Clause”); In re Grand Jury,\n821 F.2d 946, 957 (3d Cir. 1987) (“Neither the threat of harassment, the dangers of distraction,\nnor the potential disruption of confidential communications justifies a qualified privilege for the\nfull range of legislative activities normally protected by the Speech or Debate Clause.”).\nThe issue before this court is whether common law legislative immunity absolutely\nshields non-party state lawmakers from providing evidence in a civil lawsuit related to their\n12\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:720\nlegislative activities.  Given the federal interests at stake in redistricting cases, this court\nconcludes that common law legislative immunity does not entirely shield Non-Parties here.  In\nGillock, the Supreme Court noted that “where important federal interests are at stake, such as in\nthe enforcement of federal criminal statutes, comity yields.”  445 U.S. at 373.  The federal\ngovernment’s interest in enforcing voting rights statutes is, without question, important.  See,\ne.g., Irvin, 127 F.R.D. at 174 (“The federal interest in the present case is compelling.  The\nVoting Rights Act forbids local practices that abridge the fundamental right to vote. This Act\nrequires vigorous and searching federal enforcement.”); Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, ----,\n129 S. Ct. 1231, 1240, 173 L. Ed. 2d 173 (2009) (“Passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was\nan important step in the struggle to end discriminatory treatment of minorities who seek to\nexercise one of the most fundamental rights of our citizens:  the right to vote.”).  Voting rights\ncases, although brought by private parties, seek to vindicate public rights.  In this respect, they\nare akin to criminal prosecutions.  Thus, much as in Gillock, “recognition of an evidentiary\nprivilege for state legislators for their legislative acts would impair the legitimate interest of the\nFederal government.”  Gillock, 445 U.S. at 373.  \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has stated that evidentiary privileges must be “strictly\nconstrued” and accepted “only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or\nexcluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle\nof utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.”  Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 50,\n100 S. Ct. 906, 63 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1980) (citation omitted).  This court therefore does not find in\nthe common law an absolute immunity for non-party state lawmakers that protects them from\n13\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:721\nproducing documents in federal redistricting cases.  Instead, Non-Parties’ privilege claims are\nbest analyzed under the doctrine of legislative privilege. \nB. Legislative Privilege\nOther courts in different contexts have applied a qualified legislative privilege to protect\nstate lawmakers from producing documents related to their legislative activities.  This privilege\nis similar to the deliberative process privilege, which is also qualified, but the deliberative\nprocess privilege applies to the executive branch, not the legislature.  The legislative privilege\ndoes not shield lawmakers from being sued, but rather protects them from producing documents\nin certain cases.  See Lindley v. Life Ins. Co. of Am., No. 08-CV-379, 2009 WL 2245565, at *9\n(N.D. Okla. Jul. 24, 2009) (“Generally, legislators’ immunity from suit is referred to as\n‘legislative immunity,’ and the evidentiary privilege accorded legislators is referred to as the\n‘legislative privilege.’”).  Under the federal common law, legislative privilege is qualified, not\nabsolute, and may be overcome by a showing of need.  In re Grand Jury, 821 F.2d at 958;\nJoseph’s House & Shelter, Inc. v. City of Troy, N.Y., 641 F. Supp. 2d 154, 158 n.3 (N.D.N.Y.\n2009).\nIn determining whether and to what extent a state lawmaker may invoke legislative\nprivilege, the court will consider the following factors: (i) the relevance of the evidence sought\nto be protected; (ii) the availability of other evidence; (iii) the seriousness of the litigation and\nthe issues involved; (iv) the role of the government in the litigation; and (v) the possibility of\nfuture timidity by government employees who will be forced to recognize that their secrets are\nviolable.  Rodriguez v. Pataki, 280 F. Supp. 2d 89, 101 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing In re Franklin\nNat’l Bank Secs. Litig., 478 F. Supp. 577, 583 (E.D.N.Y. 1979)); see also ACORN v. County of\n14\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:722\nNassau, No.05-2301, 2009 WL 2923435, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2009) (ACORN II); Joseph’s\nHouse & Shelter, Inc, 641 F. Supp. 2d at 158 n.3.  In considering these factors, the court’s goal is\nto determine whether the need for disclosure and accurate fact finding outweighs the\nlegislature’s “need to act free of worry about inquiry into [its] deliberations.”  ACORN II, 2009\nWL 2923435, at *2 n.2.9\nC. Balancing of Interests\n1. The Seriousness of the Litigation and the Issues Involved, and the\nRole of the Government in the Litigation \nIn balancing the relevant interests, the first two factors weigh in favor of disclosure. \nThere can be little doubt that plaintiffs’ allegations are serious.  Plaintiffs raise profound\n9 These factors are also used by some courts to evaluate the availability and scope of the\ndeliberative process privilege.  See, e.g., Doe v. Nebraska, Nos. 8:09CV456, 4:09CV3266, 4:10CV3005,\n----F. Supp. 2d----, 2011 WL 1480483, at *7 (D. Neb. Apr. 19, 2011).  The deliberative process privilege\nprohibits discovery of communications that are used by governmental bodies in formulating policy. \nUnited States v. Farley, 11 F.3d 1385, 1389 (7th Cir. 1993).  The key difference between the deliberative\nprocess privilege and the legislative privilege is that the former protects executive and administrative\ndeliberations, and the latter safeguards legislative independence.  See Kay v. City of Rancho Palos\nVerdes, No. CV 02-3922, 2003 WL 25294710, at *15 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2003).  \nSome courts considering the scope of the deliberative process privilege have applied the same\nlegislative privilege factors discussed herein.  See, e.g, Doe, 2011 WL 1480483, at *7; Kay, 2003 WL\n25294710, at *18.  In this respect, “the balancing tests that courts have suggested for challenges to both\nthe legislative privilege and the deliberative process privilege are quite similar and functionally\ninterchangeable.”  Kay, 2003 WL 25294710, at *17 (collecting cases). \nSeveral cases in the Northern District of Illinois, however, have required a particularized showing\nto invoke the deliberative process privilege.  See, e.g., Buonauro v. City of Berwyn, No. 08-C-6687, 2011\nWL 2110133, at *2 (N.D. Ill. May 25, 2011) (“In order to invoke the privilege, a party must show three\nelements: (1) the department head with control over the information has made a formal claim of privilege;\n(2) the responsible official must demonstrate, usually by affidavit, the reasons for preserving the\nconfidentiality of the documents; and, (3) the official must specifically identify and describe the\ndocuments in question.”) (citing Ferrell v. U.S. Dep’t Hous. & Urban Dev., 177 F.R.D. 425, 428 (N.D.\nIll.1998)); see also Parvati Corp. v. City of Oak Forest, No. 08-C-702, 2010 WL 2836739, at *5 (N.D.\nIll. July 19, 2010).  \nBecause Non-Parties are members of the legislative branch, not the executive branch, and because\nthey have not made the particularized showing required to invoke the deliberative process privilege, the\ndeliberative process privilege does not apply.  This court will consider cases in other courts analyzing the\ndeliberative process privilege only to the extent that they bear on the scope of the legislative privilege.\n15\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 16 of 23 PageID #:723\nquestions about the legitimacy of the redistricting process and the viability of the 2011 Map. \nMoreover, the legislators’ role in the allegedly unlawful conduct is direct.  The General\nAssembly, through its members, aides and consultants, was primarily responsible for drafting,\nrevising and approving the 2011 Map.  These actions are under scrutiny.  This is not, then, “the\nusual ‘deliberative process’ case in which a private party challenges governmental action . . . and\nthe government tries to prevent its decision-making process from being swept up unnecessarily\ninto [the] public [domain].”  United States v. Bd. of Ed. of City of Chicago, 610 F. Supp 695, 700\n(N.D. Ill. 1985).  Rather, “the decisionmaking process . . . [itself] is the case,” at least to the\nextent that plaintiffs allege that the General Assembly intentionally discriminated against Latino\nand/or Republican voters.  Id. (emphasis in original).  The seriousness of the litigation and the\nrole of Non-Parties militate in favor of disclosure. \n2. The Relevance of the Evidence Sought to be Protected and the\nAvailability of Other Evidence\nAs discussed in Part I.B. the evidence plaintiffs seek is relevant, although it is not central\nto the outcome of this case.  Moreover, the availability of other evidence favors non-disclosure. \nPlaintiffs already have considerable information at their fingertips.  This includes public hearing\nminutes, special interest group position papers, statements made by lawmakers during debate,\ncommittee reports, press releases, newspaper articles, census reports, registered voter data and\nelection returns.  These documents and data are a matter of public record.  As such, these factors\nweigh against disclosure. \n3. The Possibility of Future Timidity by Government Employees\nFinally, the need to encourage frank and honest discussion among lawmakers favors non-\ndisclosure.  Plaintiffs claim that disclosure of the subpoenaed documents will not unduly chill\n16\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:724\nlegislators in their future communications because Non-Parties are not defendants in the present\nlitigation and there is little danger that any discovered material would be used against them in a\nlater criminal prosecution.  Plaintiffs also claim that because this case involves redistricting—a\ntask not oft performed by legislators—permitting discovery will not work to chill the day-to-day\nfunctioning of the legislature.   \nThe Redistricting Act, however, evolved from the same legislative process as any other\nlaw.  Legislators negotiated the law in private and debated it in public.  Infrequency is therefore\nirrelevant.  In addition, the need for confidentiality between lawmakers and their staff is of\nutmost importance.  Legislators face competing demands from constituents, lobbyists, party\nleaders, special interest groups and others.  They must be able to confer with one another without\nfear of public disclosure. \nIn this respect, the legislature is not unlike other branches of government.  As noted by\nthe Third Circuit, a “legislator’s need for confidentiality is similar to the need for confidentiality\nin communications between judges, between executive officials, and between a President and his\naides.”  In re Grand Jury, 821 F.2d at 957 (citations omitted); see also Certain Complaints\nUnder Investigation by an Investigating Comm. of the Judicial Council of the Eleventh Circuit,\n783 F.2d 1488, 1520 (11th Cir. 1986) (judicial privilege applies where matters under inquiry\nimplicate communications among a judge and his staff concerning official judicial business such\nas “the framing and researching of opinions, orders and rulings”); N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck &\nCo., 421 U.S. 132, 150, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 44 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975) (executive privilege for agency\nofficials applies to documents “reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations\n17\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 18 of 23 PageID #:725\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated”)\n(citation omitted).  \nFailure to protect confidential communications between lawmakers and their staff will\nnot only chill legislative debate, it will also discourage “earnest discussion within governmental\nwalls.”  Doe, 2011 WL 1480483, at *6 (citations omitted).  In the redistricting context, full\npublic disclosure would hinder the ability of party leaders to synthesize competing interests of\nconstituents, special interest groups and lawmakers, and draw a map that has enough support to\nbecome law.  This type of legislative horse trading is an important and undeniable part of the\nlegislative process.    \nCourts have recognized that disclosure of confidential documents concerning intimate\nlegislative activities should be avoided.  See Rodriguez, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 102; Kay, 2003 WL\n25294710, at *14.  Courts applying this approach have held that a qualified privilege protects\ndocuments “created prior to the passage and implementation [of a bill] that involve opinions,\nrecommendations or advice about legislative decisions between legislators or between legislators\nand their aides.”  Doe, 2011 WL 1480483, at *8; see generally City of Las Vegas v. Foley,\n747 F.2d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir. 1984) (“The Court prevents inquiry into the motives of legislators\nbecause it recognizes that such inquiries are a hazardous task.”) (citations omitted). \nBy limiting privileged documents to those that contain “opinions, recommendations or\nadvice,” courts have allowed discovery of “documents containing factually based information\nused in the decision-making process or disseminated to legislators or committees, such as\ncommittee reports and minutes of meetings.”  Id. at *6 (citations omitted).  Courts have also\nrequired disclosure of “the materials and information available [to lawmakers] at the time a\n18\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 19 of 23 PageID #:726\ndecision was made.” ACORN I, 2007 WL 2815810, at *4 (citing Village of Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. at n.20).   \nThis approach strikes the proper balance between the need for public accountability and\nthe desire to avoid future timidity of lawmakers.  Although always accountable to the public,\nlawmakers must be able to confer in private.  This court therefore concludes that the legislative\nprivilege shields from disclosure pre-decisional, non-factual communications that contain\nopinions, recommendations or advice about public policies or possible legislation.  It does not  \nprotect facts or information available to lawmakers at the time of their decision.  \nIn terms of the categories identified above, (1) information concerning the motives,\nobjectives, plans, reports and/or procedures used by lawmakers to draw the 2011 Map; and (2)\ninformation concerning the identities of persons who participated in decisions regarding the 2011\nMap, the need for the information is outweighed by the purposes of the qualified privilege.  The\ncontrary is true of (3) the identities of experts and/or consultants retained to assist in drafting the\n2011 Map and contractual agreements related thereto; and (4) objective facts upon which\nlawmakers relied in drawing the 2011 Map.  Indeed, much of this information is discoverable\nunder Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(ii) should defendants’ experts chose to rely on it.\nD. Waiver\nAs with any privilege, the legislative privilege can be waived when the parties holding\nthe privilege share their communications with an outsider.  See ACORN I, 2007 WL 2815810, at\n*4 (“the legislative privilege may be waived as to communications made in the presence of third\nparties”) (citation omitted).  “Where a legislative aide or staff member performs functions that\n19\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:727\nwould be deemed legislative if performed by the legislator himself, the staff member is entitled\nto the same privilege that would be available to the legislator.”  Id. (citation omitted).   Thus,\ncommunications between Non-Parties and their staff retain their privileged status.  See id. at *5.\nCommunications between Non-Parties and outsiders to the legislative process, however,\ndo not.  This includes lobbyists, members of Congress and the Democratic Congressional\nCampaign Committee (“DCCC”).  Although these groups may have a heightened interest in the\noutcome of the redistricting process, they could not vote for or against the Redistricting Act, nor\ndid they work for someone who could.  As such, the legislative privilege does not apply.  See\nRodriguez, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 101 (“a conversation between legislators and knowledgeable\noutsiders, such as lobbyists, to mark up legislation [is] a session for which no one could seriously\nclaim privilege”).  \nThe same rule applies to experts and/or consultants retained or utilized by Non-Parties to\nassist in the redistricting process.  “While legislators are certainly free to seek information from\noutside sources, they may not assume that every such contact is forever shielded from view. . . .\n[A] contrary ruling would allow a legislator to cloak any communication with legislative\nprivilege by simply retaining an outsider in some capacity.”  ACORN I, 2007 WL 2815810, at\n*6.  Thus, to the extent that Non-Parties relied on reports or recommendations generated by\noutside consultants to draft the 2011 Map, they waived their legislative privilege as to these\ndocuments. \nFinally, Non-Parties cannot invoke the privilege as to themselves yet allow others to use\nthe same information against plaintiffs at trial.  See, e.g., Brown v. City of Detroit, 259 F. Supp.\n2d 611, 623–24 (E.D. Mich. 2003); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Lynch, No. C-01-3023, 2002 WL\n20\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 77 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:728\n32812098, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2002).  As such, any communications disclosed by Non-\nParties to defendants or their trial experts, upon which defendants or their experts intend to rely,\nmust be disclosed to plaintiffs.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(ii).10      \nORDER \nPlaintiffs’ motion to compel enforcement of third party subpoena [Dkt. No. 52] and\ncertain non-parties’ motion to quash subpoenas and for a protective order [Dkt. No. 58] are\ngranted in part and denied in part, respectively. Non-parties are directed to comply with this\norder by October 19, 2011, specifically as follows: \nTo the extent that plaintiffs seek documents containing the (1) motives, objectives, plans,\nreports and/or procedures created, formulated or used by lawmakers to draw the 2011 Map prior\nto the passage of the Redistricting Act;11 or (2) identities of persons who participated in decisions\nregarding the 2011 Map,12 their requests are denied and the subpoenas are quashed.  Plaintiffs\nare also prohibited from subpoenaing the aforementioned documents from individual members\nof the General Assembly unless the member affirmatively waives his or her legislative privilege\nin writing.\n10 Non-Parties indicated that to the extent the legislative privilege did not shield them from\ndiscovery, they would likely assert attorney-client privilege or work product immunity.  This decision\naddresses only the legislative privilege raised in the motions.  If Non-Parties have a serious basis for\nasserting any other privilege, this decision does not foreclose them.\n11 See Req. Nos. 1– 6, 8, 14–17. [Doc. No. 52-1.]\n12 See Req. Nos. 7, 9–11, 20–21.

For\nthesereasons,thisPanelshouldbarthetestimonyofJuanRangel.\nBACKGROUND\n1. Pursuant to a duly issued subpoena, counsel for the Plaintiffs deposed Rangel on\nOctober 6, 2011. See deposition transcript attached hereto as Exhibit A. During the course of\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:2368\nhis deposition, Rangel repeatedly disclaimed any knowledge of the claims, allegations, or\ndefenses arisinginthislitigation.

While Rangel acknowledged that he was actively involved in the redistricting of\nthe Illinois state legislative districts on behalf of the United Neighborhood Organization\n(“UNO”)1, and even proposed certain Illinois state legislative districts as part of the public\nhearing process, he had no involvement with or knowledge of any particular information\nconcerningthe Congressional reapportionment process or the Adopted Plan. Quite the contrary,\nover the course of his deposition, Rangel specifically and repeatedly denied that he had any\ninvolvement with or knowledge of the Adopted Plan. For example, Rangel testified that neither\nhenoranyoneactingon behalfofUNO:\n Had Any Involvement In Drawing Any Congressional District(s): Rangel\nspecifically testified that unlike, the extensive map drawing exercise that he and\nothers undertook to proffer Latino majority or influence districts for the state\nlegislative map, he did not engage in any similar exercise of drawing any draft\nCongressional districts as part of the redistricting process for the Congressional\nmaps. Id. at 49:7-20; see also id. at 60:23-61:4. Rangel further testified that he\ndid not “engage[e] in a Congressional district map process” leading up to UNO\ntakingapositionvis-à-vis theCongressionalmap. Id.at52:5-18.\n Conducted No Specific Analysis of Any Aspect of a Congressional\nReapportionment Plan: Even in endorsing the concept of “one Congressional\ndistrict” containing a Latino majority, Rangel admitted that neither UNO nor\nanyoneactingonUNO’s behalfsat downand “crunchedthenumbers”ofwhatthe\nspecific demographic information or political data were, or particular lines were\ndrawnofDistrict4. RangelDep.65:21-66:7.\n Had No Specific Knowledge of Any Demographic Information Which Would\nServe As the Underpinnings of a Congressional Reapportionment Plan: In\nfact, apart from the “common knowledge that there’s been a population growth\nwithin the Latino communityin the state of Illinois” based on census information,\nRangel testified that he did not look at anyother demographic information related\nto any population changes in Illinois relative to the Congressional redistricting\nprocess. Id. at 53:4-17. Rangel further stated that he was unaware of anybody\nacting on behalf of UNO who reviewed any demographic information related to\n1 Accordingtohistestimony,RangelhasbeentheChiefExecutiveOfficerofUNOforthelastfifteenyears.\nRangelDep.11:4-13,Oct.6,2011.\n2\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:2369\npopulation in Illinois in connection with aCongressional redistrictingprocess. Id.\nat53:24-54:5.\n Did Not Conduct Any Analysis or Otherwise Had Knowledge About Racial\nBlocVoting,Effectiveness of Any District, or Any KnowledgeorViews about\n“Influence” Districts As They Pertain to the Congressional Reapportionment\nPlans: Rangel also testified that neither he nor UNO or anyone acting on UNO’s\nbehalf engaged in any racial bloc voting analysis with respect to anything related\nto Congressional redistricting in 2010 or 2011. Rangel Dep. 55:9-15; see also id.\nat57:3-8. Forthatmatter,Rangel testifiedthathehadno “specific knowledge”as\nto whether any elected officials from Springfield conducted any kind of racial\nblocvotinganalysis related to theCongressionalredistrictingprocess. Id.at 61:5-\n20. According to Rangel, neither he, nor UNO, or anyone acting on UNO’s\nbehalf conducted any kind of analysis that attempted to determine the\neffectiveness of any Latino majoritydistrict related to Congressional redistricting.\nId.at57:12-23.\nIn addition, Rangel testified that he was not aware of any specific analysis of\nLatino voting patterns in Northern Illinois “in attempting to shape a\nCongressional district” conducted by UNO or any of the other Latino\nconstituency organizations during the Congressional redistricting process. Id. at\n70:1-6. Further, Rangel admitted that neither he, nor UNO, conducted any kind\nofanalysistodeterminethepercentageofvotingagepopulationnecessarytohave\nan effective district for Latinos in the context of Congressional redistricting. Id.\nat 71:9-72:18; see also id. at 72:19-73:20 (admitting that Rangel was not\nspecifically aware of any analysis undertaken by any other Latino constituency\norganization regarding the percentage of voting age population required to have\naneffectivedistrictfor LatinosinthecontextofCongressionalredistricting).\n Never Explored the Possibility of Two Viable Latino Congressional Districts:\nRangel testified that neither he nor UNO or anyone acting on UNO’s behalf\nconducted any analysis to determine whether or not, with respect to the\nCongressional redistricting, there could be drawn two Latino majority districts.\nId. at 58:2-11; see also id. at 60:11-21 (testifying that neither he nor UNO or\nanyone acting on UNO’s behalf conducted any analysis to determine whether or\nnot the two enclaves comprising the “earmuffs” of District 4 could be uncoupled\ntofunctionasviableLatinodistricts).\n Had No Knowledge of the Intent or Purpose of the Actual Drafters of the\nAdopted Plan: Rangel also testified that he was not in consultation with any\nmember of the Illinois House or Senate, nor any staff members of the Illinois\nHouse or Senate regarding UNO’s position as to one majority Latino\nCongressional district or any issue related to Illinois’ Congressional districts\nwhatsoever. 75:22-76:12.\n3\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:2370\nBy his own admissions, Rangel has an opinion about the Adopted Plan that happens to\nalign perfectlywith his Democratic patrons,butis otherwiseuntethered fromactual facts ordata.\nConsequently, there is no basis to conclude that Rangel has any testimony which falls within the\nRule402thresholdofrelevanceandheshouldthereforebebarred fromtestifying.\nARGUMENT\n3. As this Panelis wellaware, acourt has the power to excludeevidence in limineas\npart of its inherent authority to manage trials. Sachs v. Reef Aquaria Design, Inc., 2007 WL\n3223336, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 25, 2007). Such motions should be granted if “the evidence is\nclearly not admissible for any purpose.” Id. Under FED. R. EVID. 402, “Evidence which is not\nrelevant is not admissible.” As a result, it is proper for a court to grant a motion in limine to\nexclude evidence that is not relevant. See, e.g., Ponce v. Tim’s Time, Inc., 2006 WL 941963, at\n*1(N.D. Ill.Mar.16,2006)(grantingmotion inliminetoexcludeevidenceofimmigrationstatus\nnot relevant to FLSA claim); Mason v. City of Chicago, 641 F.Supp.2d 726, 729-30 (N.D. Ill\n2009)(evidencenotrelevanttodamageswasproperlyexcludedfromtrial).\n4. Evidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that\nis of consequenceto the determination ofthe action moreprobableor less probablethan it would\nbe without the evidence.” FED. R. EVID. 401. Evidence “need not conclusively decide the\nultimate issue in a case . . . but it must in some degree advance the inquiry.” Gupta v. Board of\nRegents of University of Wisconsin System, 63 Fed App’x 925, 928, (7th Cir. 2003) (quoting\nE.E.O.C. v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co., 256 F.3d 516, 533 (7th Cir. 2001) and affirming district court’s\ngrant of motion in limine on relevance grounds). Therefore, because Rangel’s deposition\ntestimonyis clear that he has no knowledge that could “advancetheinquiry” related to theissues\n4\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:2371\nset forth in this litigation, any evidence he attempts to offer is not relevant and thus not\nadmissible.\n5. Plaintiffs’ race-related claims and Defendants’ defenses turn on whether the\nAdopted Plan violates the U.S. Constitution and the VotingRights Act. Thus, to be relevant and\nadmissible, evidence presented must have a tendency to prove or disprove that: (1) the Adopted\nPlan violates the Equal Protection Clause because race was the predominant factor motivating\ntheshapeofAdopted District 4 and thegerrymandered districtis not narrowlytailored to comply\nwith any compelling interest; or (2) the Adopted Plan intentionally and unlawfully dilutes the\nvotes of Latinos by packing Latinos into District 4, while it reduces the Latino population in\nneighboring Districts 3 and 5 to arrest the growing Latino community’s influence over contests\ninthosedistricts.\n6. As set forth above, because Rangel repeatedly disclaimed any knowledge related\nto the above claims and defenses or anydata analysis or anyspecific facts related to the Adopted\nPlan or, frankly, any aspect of the Congressional reapportionment process in Illinois in 2011, he\ncanprovideno relevantevidenceandshouldbeexcludedasawitness.\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE,fortheforegoingreasonsPlaintiffs requestthattheCourt grantPlaintiffs’\nMotioninLiminetoExcludeJuanRangelas awitnessfortheDefendants.\n5\n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:2372\nDated: November10,2011 RespectfullySubmitted,\nBy: LoriE.Lightfoot\nTyroneC.

It was  an  employment  issue  at  our \n4  schools. \n5  Q.  Okay.  You  probably  then  got  some  feel \n6  for  the  back  and  forth  of  the  deposition,  but  let  me \n7  give  you  a  couple  of  reminders  then.  One  of  the \n8  most  important  things  is,  you  see  that  the  court \n9  reporter  is  taking  down  a  verbatim  transcript  of \n10  everything  that  is  going  to  be  said here  today. \n11  There  are  a  couple  of  rules  that  follow  from  the \n12  fact  that  there  is  a  verbatim  transcript.  The  first \n13  is  that  it's important  for  you  and  for  me  not  to \n14  talk  over  each  other.  It's a  little artificial, \n15  because  the  way  that  people  normally  communicate, \n16  you  get  the  gist  of  what  somebody  is  saying,  you \n17  respond,  and  there's  a  back  and  forth,  and  that's \n18  normal  conversation  mode.  But  in  this  context  with \n19  the  deposition,  it's  important  that  you  let  me \n20  finish  answering  -- asking  the  question,  and  by  the \n21  same  token,  you  -- I  will  let you  fully  answer \n22  before  you  begin  -- before  I  begin  asking  you  any \n23  follow-up.  Do  you  understand  that? \n24  A.  Yes. \nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nSuite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 9 of 110 PageID #:2381\nJuan  Rangel  October  6,  2011 \n7 \n1  Q.  The  other  thing  that's  important  is  that \n2  you  must  answer  the  questions  verbally.  And  by \n3  that  again,  it's a  little artificial,  because \n4  when  we  talk  to  people  in  normal  conversation,  you \n5  use  body  language,  you  nod  your  head,  you  shrug  your \n6  shoulders.  You  may  do  other  non-verbal  responses. \n7  But  in  this  context,  it's  important  that  you \n8  actually  respond  verbally.  Everyone  forgets.  If \n9  you  forget,  I  will  remind  you.  I  am  sure  your  very \n10  able  Counsel  will  remind  you  if you  forget.  But \n11  that's  another  important  rule. \n12  There  may  be  from  time  to  time  objections \n13  that  are  interposed,  either  from  Mr.  Bruce  or  from \n14  your  Counsel,  to  a  question  that  I  might  ask.  That \n15  is  kind  of  standard  fare.  Lawyers  have  a  right  to \n16  object  if  they  think  there's  some  kind  of \n17  imperfection  with  the  question.  Two  things  about \n18  that.  One,  don't  be  bothered  by  that,  because  it \n19  will  happen.  Two,  if  someone  objects,  and  unless \n20  your  lawyer  instructs  you  not  to  answer  a  question, \n21  then  you  are  still obligated  to  answer  the  question. \n22  As  a  matter  of  course,  I  have  never \n23  seen  ~- a  witness,  particularly one  who  hasn't \n24  testified  a  lot,  if  there  are  objections,  will \nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nSuite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 10 of 110 PageID #:2382\nJuan  Rangel  October  6,  2011 \n8 \n1  sometimes  tend  to  forget  what  the  question  is,  and \n2  that's  why  we  have  a  verbatim  transcript.  You  can \n3  either have  the  question  read  back  to  you  or  I  can \n4  restate  it.  So  don't  be  thrown  off  by  the  fact  that \n5  there  may  be  objections.  But  two,  if you  forget  the \n6  question,  thatis  also  fine,  too,  because  I  can \n7  either  restate  it or  we  can  have  the  court  reporter \n8  read  it back. \n9  If  there's  something  about  a  question \n10  that  I  ask  you  that  you  don't  understand,  then  feel \n11  free  to  tell  me  that  you  don't  understand  it.  I  may \n12  press  you  a  little bit  and  ask  you  what  part  you \n13  don't  understand  or why  you  don't  understand  it. \n14  But  this  is  not  a  memory  test.  It's not  a  guessing \n15  game.  It's  just  to  get  what  you  know  as  you  sit \n16  here  today,  and  what  your  recollection  lS.  If  I  ask \n17  a  question,  though,  in  such  a  way  that  you  don't \n18  understand  it,  feel  free  to  say,  I  don't  understand \n19  it,  and  then  we  will  try  to  work  through  that \n20  together. \n21  You,  obviously,  have  Counsel  here,  and \n22  you  should  feel  free  to  consult  with  your  Counsel  at \n23  any  point.  My  only  request,  though,  is  that  if \n24  there's  a  question  pending,  that  you  answer  the \nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nSuite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 11 of 110 PageID #:2383\nJuan  Rangel  October  6,  2011 \n9 \n1  question  first,  and  then  ask  your  Counsel  whatever \n2  you  want.  But,  obviously,  if  you  can't  answer  the \n3  question  without  consulting  with  your  Counsel,  you \n4  should  just  let  me  know  that,  and  then  -- clearly, \n5  that  is  your  right  as  a  witness,  to  consult  with \n6  your  Counsel. \n7  It  is  certainly my  objective  to  stay  away \n8  from  anything  and  I  say  this  more  for  your \n9  lawyers  than  for  you  -- but  to  stay  away  from \n10  anything  that  might  even  remotely  impinge  upon \n11  attorney/client  privilege.  I  know  you  are  a \n12  litigant  in  the  State  redistricting  case.  I  am \n13  going  to  ask  you  very  little about  thatj  and, \n14  frankly,  not  even  about  the  case  itself.  I  am  gOlng \n15  to  ask  you  about  some  of  your  testimony  through  the \n16  public  hearing  process.

But,  obviously,  if you  think  it does, \n20  you  will  let  me  know,  and  then  we  can,  again,  work \n21  together  on  either me  reasking  it,  or  you  will  make \n22  your  objection. \n23  I  don't  expect  our  time  here  today  to  be \n24  particularly  long,  which  is  probably  a  welcome  news \nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nSuite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 12 of 110 PageID #:2384\nJuan  Rangel  October  6,  2011 \n10 \n1  for  you,  as  I  said before  the  deposition  started, \n2  but  I  do  think  it will  probably  be  somewhere  between \n3  one  hour  and  two  hours.

For  purposes  of  today,  I  am  going  to  use \n9  the  shorthand  UNO,  and  I  assume  you  will  know  what  I \n10  mean.  Is  that  all  right? \n11  A.  Yes. \n12  Q.  How  long  have  you  been  the  CEO  at  UNO? \n13  A.  Fifteen years. \n14  Q.  Okay.  And  can  you  tell us,  sir,  as  the \n15  job  is  now,  what  your  specific  responsibilities \n16  entail  as  the  CEO  of  UNO? \n17  A.  It's the  day-to-day  management  of  the \n18  organization,  although,  a  large  part  of  the \n19  organization  is  managing  our  charter  school \n20  operation,  which  is  -- now  encompasses  11  schools, \n21  5,400  students  across  the  city.

And  can  you  tell  me,  sir  -- obviously, \n4  the  charter  school  mission  is  a  substantial  amount \n5  of  what  UNO  does. \n6  Aside  from  that,  can  you  tell me,  are \n7  there  any  other  programatic  areas  that  UNO  is \n8  invested  in  at  this  point? \n9  A.  Well,  the  overall  mission  of  the \n10  organization  is  the  empowerment  of  Hispanic \n11  communities,  and  that  would  entail  leadership \n12  development  programs  that  we  operate,  and  then  just \n13  a  host  of  other  programs  that  are  part  of  the \n14  schools,  like  after-school  programs,  and  things  like \n15  that,  that  support  the  schooli  looking  at  issues \n16  relevant  to  our  community,  whether  it's housing \n17  issues,  employment  issues,  immigration  issues. \n18  Q.  Okay.  And  I  assume  -- and  you  will \n19  correct  me  if  I  am  wrong  -- that  UNO  is  a  501 (c)  (3) \n20  organization? \n21  A.  Yes. \n22  Q.

Well,  whether  let's put  it this  way: \n6  Does  UNO  either directly or  do  you  hire  someone  to \n7  engage  in  lobbying  on  behalf  of  the  various \n8  programatic  issues  with  respect  to  UNO? \n9  MR.

Okay.  And  are  those  individuals  engaged \n3  in  doing  any  lobbying  in  Springfield,  which  is  the \n4  capital? \n5  A.  Do  they  do  that?  I  assume  that  that's \n6  what  they  do,  yes. \n7  Q.  Okay.  I  take  it then,  sir,  that  the \n8  folks  that  are  engaged  on  behalf  of  UNO  doing \n9  lobbying  in  Springfield  are  not  directly  reporting \n10  In  to  you;  is  that  right? \n11  A.  They  do  at  times.  It  depends  on  what  the \n12  project  may  be. \n13  Q.  Okay. \n14  A.  So  sometimes  I  am  engaged  directly with \n15  them.  Other  times  it's  -- might  be  other  staff. \n16  Q.  Okay. \n17  A.  Depending  on  what  the  issue  may  be. \n18  Q.  Okay.  For  example,  is  there  any  -- In \n19  the  same  time  period,  2010,  2011  -- does  UNO  -- has \n20  UNO  advocated  on  behalf  of  any  particular \n21  legislation  that's  either been  introduced  or \n22  potentially  introduced  down  in  Springfield? \n23  A.

I  guess  more  recently was  the  Senate  Bill \n3  7,  which  was  the  education  bill  that  was  passed. \n4  There's  been  looking  at  funding  formulas  for \n5  schools,  for  education  as  well.  I  don't  know  that \n6  there  was  a  particular bill  for  those. \n7  I  am  trying  to  think  between  2010,  2011. \n8  So  yes,  there's  been  --\n9  Q.  Okay.  I  am  going  to  ask  you  both  because \n10  of  the  outside  noise  you  can  probably  hear  the \n11  ambulance  that  seems  to  be  going  by  -- but  also  your \n12  voice  is  a  little  low  -- I  am  sure  it's my  bad \n13  hearing  -- but  if  you  could  just  keep  your  voice  up \n14  a  little bit. \n15  A.  Absolutely. \n16  Q.  So  you  told us  that  you  were  you, \n17  meaning  UNO,  was  involved  in  advocating  on  behalf  of \n18  Senate  Bill  7,  which  was  the  education  bill. \n19  A.  Uh-huh. \n20  Q.  And  is  that  I  will  show  my  ignorance. \n21  But  is  that  the  bill  that  got  a  huge  amount  of  press \n22  about  changing  the  school  day,  strike  rules,  and \n23  other  things?

Any  other,  kind  of,  legislative \n3  initiatives  regarding  Springfield  that  UNO  has  been \n4  involved  in  during  the,  kind  of,  2010/2011 \n5  legislative  cycle? \n6  A.

As  ln  Springfieldi  not,  for  example,  Cook \n10  County  Board,  or  not  the  City  of  Chicago.

I'm  sorry. \n8  Q.  When  you  say  \"From  the  State,\"  what  do \n9  you  mean? \n10  A.  I  believe  there  was  -- the  State  made \n11  available  computers  to  the  public  to  be  able  to  draw \n12  our  own  maps,  as  we  saw  fit,  for  our  community.  And \n13  so  at  that  time,  the  only  ones,  as  far  as  I \n14  understood,  that  was  available  was  down  in \n15  Springfield.  So  we  would  travel  down  there  to \n16  access  those  computers.  But  there  was  always  a \n17  staff  person  there  present  as  we  were  working  on  the \n18  computers. \n19  So  the  level  of  assistance  was  them \n20  explaining  how  to  draw  what  you  -- how  to  manipulate \n21  the  computer  to  be  able  to  do  what  we  needed  to  do. \n22  But  at  no  time  did  they  assist  us  in  the  physical \n23  drawing  of  the  maps. \n24  Q.

If  I  recall,  the  way  the  software  -- why \n3  we  had  to  go  to  Springfield,  because  of  specific \n4  software  for  mapping  purposes.  And  I  found  it to  be \n5  unique  in  the  sense  that  you  have  the  existing \n6  boundaries  of  a  particular district,  but  it would \n7  give  you  the  population  that  exists  within  that. \n8  And  so  those  figures  would  represent  that.  And  as \n9  we  would  shift  the  lines,  looking  to  try  to  capture \n10  the  number  that  is  needed,  the  total  numbers  would \n11  change  over  time. \n12  Q.  Okay.  So  if  I  am  hearing  you \n13  correctly  -- and  let's  stick with  page  2,  which  is \n14  RD  1.  Once  you  would,  kind  of,  zero  in  on  the \n15  geographic  area  that  you  were  going  to  focus  on  for \n16  a  particular map,  the  computer  program  would \n17  automatically  load  it up  with  this  -- what  I  will \n18  call  demographic  information  under  Existing,  and \n19  then  under  Proposed;  is  that  correct? \n20  A.  Correct. \n21  Q.  Okay.  So  to  the  extent  that  that \n22  information  exists  on  other  maps  within  Exhibit  I, \n23  it was  the  same  kind  of  process?

Now,  in  looking  at  the  maps  for \n6  which  there  are  demographic  information  -- and  I \n7  should  back  up  because  I  don't  know  this. \n8  A  number  of  these  maps  have  the  header \n9  RD,  and  then  a  number  that  follows.

Again,  as  it pertains  to  a  State  map  --\n3  because  I  assume  -- I  am  a  little confused  as  to \n4  what  we  are  discussing  here.  But  when  we  were \n5  looking  at  the  State  maps  -- if  that's  what  we  are \n6  talking  about  now  -- looking  at  areas  -- I  think  our \n7  position  was  always  not  losing  the  gains  that  we \n8  have  made  over  the  last  ten  years. \n9  There  is  a  possibility of  adding  on \n10  influence  areas  within  a  district.  So  some  of  the \n11  districts  that  you  pointed  out  that  don't  have  a \n12  majority  Hispanic  voting  age,  clearly,  there's  a \n13  community  of  interest  there;  not  enough, \n14  necessarily,  to  elect  a  Hispanic,  I  guess  you  can \n15  say,  but  enough  to  have  their  interests  in  some  way \n16  looked  at. \n17  BY  MS.

He  never  testified  to  that.  You  haven't \n15  asked  him  what  his  involvement  in  the  Congressional \n16  maps  was  at  all.  And  so  I  object.

Correct. \n18  Q.  And  sounds  like  there  was  a  third \n19  objective,  which  was  to  make  sure  that  the  rights \n20  and  objectives  of  other  minority  groups  in  the  state \n21  were  also  respected;  is  that  correct? \n22  A.

UNO  came  out  and  supported \n5  the  Congressional  map  that  was  passed  by  the  General \n6  Assembly  and  signed  into  law  by  the  Governor;  is \n7  that  correct? \n8  A.  I  don't  know  that  it was  -- the \n9  Congressional  map \n10  Q.  That's  what  I  am  talking  about. \n11  A.  -- specifically? \n12  I  think  our  position  was  in  support  of \n13  one  Congressional  district. \n14  Q.  Okay. \n15  A.  I  am  not  sure  about  the  specific  map  as \n16  it's delineated  throughout.  But  the  concept  of  one \n17  Congressional  district  is  what  we  stood  behind. \n18  Q.  And  in  fair  point,  I  didn't  mean  to \n19  overstate  what  your  endorsement  was. \n20  So  in  other  words,  UNO  has  taken  a \n21  position  that  it  supports  the  CD  4  as  it  is \n22  reflected  in  the  map  that  was  passed  by  the  General \n23  Assembly  and  signed  into  law  by  the  Governor, \n24  correct? \nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nSuite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 65 of 110 PageID #:2437\nJuan  Rangel  October  6,  2011 \n63 \n1  A.  Again,  it's  -- I  don't  know  that  we  took \n2  a  position  specifically to  the  map  that  was \n3  approved.  I  think  our  position  was  the  concept  of \n4  one  Congressional  district. \n5  Q.  Are  you  finished? \n6  Okay.  I  don't  want  to  be  accused  of \n7  interrupting  you. \n8  All  right.  So  let  me  ask  it a  different \n9  way  then,  and  make  sure  we  are  both  on  the  same \n10  page. \n11  What  you  are  saying  is  that  UNO  came  out \n12  in  support  of  the  concept  of  having  one  majority \n13  Latino  districti  is  that  correct? \n14  A.  Correct. \n15  Q.  But  UNO  has  not  taken  a  position with \n16  respect  to  the  specific  iteration of  CD  4  that  is  in \n17  the  -- in  the  map  that  was  passed  by  the  General \n18  Assembly  and  signed  into  law  by  the  Governori  1S \n19  that  the  distinction  you  are  drawing? \n20  A.  Yes,  although,  I  think  that  we  are \n21  satisfied with  the  map  that  was  produced  by  the \n22  State  because  it followed  the  concept  of  one \n23  Congressional  district. \n24  Q.

And  all  I  am  saying  is  ln  terms  of  the \n2  lines,  where  the  lines  are  drawn,  what  streets  and \n3  all  that,  it's  -- we  were  happy  that  the  State \n4  followed  what  we  believe  is  the  best  in  the  best \n5  interest  of  our  community  at  that  time. \n6  Q.  lim  sorry,  go  ahead. \n7  A.  That's  it. \n8  Q.  And  that  is  one  majority  Latino \n9  A.  Congressional  district,  yes. \n10  Q.  Okay.  In  other  words,  you  are  not  --\n11  neither  you  nor  UNO  are  specifically endorsing  the \n12  various  line  drawing  that  constitutes  CD  4;  is  that \n13  correct? \n14  A.  I  don't  want  to  come  across  like  we  are \n15  opposing  it either. \n16  Q.  No,  I  understand.  You  qualified  it,  so  I \n17  just  want  to  understand  what  the  qualification \n18  means. \n19  A.  I  think  our  position  was  that  this  is  our \n20  preference  of  having  one  Congressional  district, \n21  along  with  a  coalition of  organizations  that  came \n22  together.  Whether  it was  a  specific  endorsement  of \n23  that  map,  I  am  not  sure  it was  that  either.  But  it \n24  wasn't  like  we  were  opposed  to  the  map  so  --\nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nESQll!.Rg  Suite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 67 of 110 PageID #:2439\nJuan  Rangel  October  6,  2011 \n65 \n1  Q.  I  am  just  trying  to  get  at  -- let me  just \n2  ask  it directly,  since  we  are  on  the  topic. \n3  Has  UNO  taken  any  specific  position \n4  regarding  the  particular way  in which  CD  4,  as \n5  reflected  in  the  map  that  was  passed  and  signed  into \n6  law,  have  you  taken  any  specific  position  as  to  that \n7  particular  district,  beyond  the  concept  of,  We \n8  support  one  majority  Latino  district? \n9  A.  I  think  our  position  was  that  we  support \n10  the  map  that  was  passed  by  the  State  because  it \n11  followed  the  concept.  So  it's kind  of  like  -- I \n12  don't  mean  to  be  obtuse  about  it.  It's  just  that \n13  the  State  passed  a  map,  and  even  though  we  weren't \n14  looking  at  the  specific  lines,  it  followed  the \n15  concept  of  one  Congressional  district,  and  we  were \n16  satisfied with  that. \n17  So  I  guess  in  some  way  we  were  endorsing \n18  the  map,  without  saying,  This  is  the  map  that  we \n19  want.  It's  the  concept  of  one  Congressional \n20  district. \n21  Q.  So  in  other  words,  in  endorsing  the \n22  concept  let's  stick with  that  -- of  one \n23  Congressional  district,  it  sounds  like,  based  on  the \n24  comments  that  you  just  made  and  our  previous \nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nSuite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 68 of 110 PageID #:2440\nJuan  Rangel  October  6/  2011 \n66 \n1  discussion  about  what  analysis  was  done  -- that  UNO \n2  or  anybody  acting  on  behalf  of  UNO  hadn't  sat  down \n3  and/  you  know/  crunched  the  numbers/  so  to  speak/  of \n4  what  the  specific  demographic  information  was/ \n5  political  data/  or  where  particular  lines  may  have \n6  been  drawni  is  that  correct? \n7  A.  Correct. \n8  Q.  All  right.  Okay.  I  now  understand  what \n9  you  were  saying. \n10  Tell  me,  sir,  then  why  -- what  was  the \n11  basis  for  UNO's  endorsement  of  the  concept  of  one \n12  majority  Latino  Congressional  district. \n13  A.  Sure.  I  think  initially,  just  given  the \n14  census  figures  in  the  state  of  Illinois,  it's \n15  obvious  the  Latino  community  has  grown. \n16  Q.  Sure. \n17  A.  And  I  think  there's  always  been  a  desire \n18  to  see  more  representation  on  the  Congressional \n19  side. \n20  But  after having  conversations  with  other \n21  organizations  in  terms  of  what  the  position  ought  to \n22  be,  and  try to  present  a  united  front  on  this  topic, \n23  kind  of,  was  a  give-and-take,  in  trying  to  figure \n24  out  what  was  best  for  our  community.

So  that  was  the  basis  of  our  position. \n11  Q.  SO  you  said  a  couple  things  there  that  I \n12  want  to  just  follow  up  with  you  on. \n13  You  said  something  about,  The  reality of \n14  voting  patterns  within  our  community.  What  did  you \n15  mean  by  that,  sir? \n16  A.  Unfortunately,  Latinos  vote  in  very  small \n17  numbers,  and  for  different  reasons.  You  have  --\n18  could  have  a  very  large  Latino  population,  but  it \n19  may  not  be  a  voting  population.  It may  not  be \n20  eligible  to  vote. \n21  And  then  you  do  have  those  that  are \n22  eligible  to  vote  that  may  not  vote  themselves.  And, \n23  to  me,  that's  kind  of  -- that's  the  certain  reality \n24  that  we  need  to  contend  with.

So  that  was  the \n3  logic  that  we  used. \n4  Q.  Let  me  ask  you  this  then:  With  respect \n5  to  that  concern  about  Latinos  voting  in  small \n6  numbers,  and  the  potential  to  lose  gains  that  had \n7  come  -- I  am  talking  specifically about  the \n8  Congressional  process  -- are  you  aware  of  whether  or \n9  not  any  of  the  various  groups  that  you  were  talking \n10  about  in  arriving  at  this  discussion,  are  you  aware \n11  that  any  of  them  had  conducted  any  kind  of  specific \n12  voting  analysis  of  how  Latinos  vote  anywhere  ln \n13  Northern  Illinois  over  any  period  of  time? \n14  A.  I  am  not  aware  of  a  specific  but,  again, \n15  I  am  going  to  assume  that  some  of  them  had. \n16  Q.  So  beyond  your  assumption,  in  any  of \n17  these  conversations  that  you  were  having  that  led  to \n18  the  conclusion  that  you  could  endorse  the  concept  of \n19  one  Latino  majority  Congressional  district,  are  you \n20  aware  for  a  fact  as  to  whether  or  not  any  of  the \n21  various  constituency groups  that  you  were  talking \n22  with  had  actually  done  any  kind  of  analysis  of \n23  Latino  voting  patterns  in  Northern  Illinois  and \n24  by  that  I  mean  city of  Chicago,  Cook,  suburban  Cook, \nToll Free: 800.708.8087 \nFacsimile: 312.704.4950 \nSuite 1200 \n311 West Monroe Street \nChicago, IL 60606 \nwww.esquiresolutions.com \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 121-1 Filed: 11/10/11 Page 71 of 110 PageID #:2443\nJuan  Rangel  October  6,  2011 \n69 \n1  at  -- for  any  time  period? \n2  MR.

Miller, Jr. \n              )  (3-judge court convened pursuant to  \nDefendants.      )  28 U.S.C. § 2284) \n   \nDEFENDANTS’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  Defendants, by their attorney Lisa Madigan, Attorney General for the State of Illinois, \nrespectfully provide the following Reply in support of their Motion to Dismiss.  As explained in \nthis Reply, Plaintiffs‘ Response does not effectively refute Defendants‘ arguments in their \nMotion to Dismiss that the Complaint fails to state any claims for which relief can be granted.  \nAs a result, the Complaint should be dismissed. \nI.  Plaintiffs Have Conceded That They Cannot Establish the Gingles Preconditions for \na Claim Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and Therefore Fail to State a \nVoting Rights Act Claim \n \nPlaintiffs appear to concede that they cannot establish the ―necessary preconditions‖ for a \nclaim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), originally set out in Thornburg \nv. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986).  (See Pls.‘ Resp. 2.)  Plaintiffs instead insist that they need \nnot meet the Gingles requirements because they have used the word ―intentional‖ in their \nComplaint.  With no analysis as to what test is appropriate, Plaintiffs then simply assume that a \nclaim of intentional race dilution under Section 2 is subject to the same standard as constitutional \nclaims of vote dilution.   \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 2 of 13 PageID #:732\nPlaintiffs‘ assumption is false.  A Section 2 claim is a claim that a voting practice or \nprocedure ―results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to \nvote on account of race or color . . . ,‖ and Gingles concluded that redistricting (as opposed to \nother voting practices or procedures) may result in the denial or abridgment of the right to vote \nunder Section 2 only when the Gingles requirements are met.  42 U.S.C. § 1973; Gingles, 478 \nU.S. at 48 (―unless there is a conjunction of the following circumstances [the Gingles \nrequirements], the use of multimember districts generally will not impede the ability of minority \nvoters to elect representatives of their choice‖); see also Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40-41 \n(1993) (extending the Gingles requirements to single member districting schemes and \nconcluding that ―[u]nless these points are established, there neither has been a wrong nor can \n[there] be a remedy‖ under Section 2).  The Supreme Court has applied these requirements in \nevery challenge to redistricting under Section 2 since Gingles, and has never found vote dilution \nwhere the requirements have not been met.  There is no reason why allegations of intent should \nchange the definition of when redistricting may result in the denial or abridgment of the right to \nvote.  Plaintiffs have not provided a supportable one and nothing in the Supreme Court‘s \njurisprudence suggests one.1  \nIndeed, the Eleventh Circuit has held that discriminatory intent does not eliminate or \nlessen the effects showing required for a Section 2 claim.  Johnson v. DeSoto County Bd. of \nComm’rs, 72 F.3d 1556, 1564 (11th Cir. 1996).  Only one of the cases Plaintiffs cite is to the \ncontrary, and that case, Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 769 (9th Cir. 1990), holds \n                       \n1 To the extent Plaintiffs assume that the Gingles requirements do not apply to intentional dilution claims \nunder the VRA based on jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause, Defendants note first that the \nCourt has not considered an intentional dilution claim under the Equal Protection Clause since the Court \ndecided Gingles, and second, that a vote dilution claim under the Equal Protection Clause focuses on \ndifferential treatment on the basis of race, not discriminatory effect.        \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 3 of 13 PageID #:733\nonly that the first Gingles requirement – the majority showing – does not apply when intentional \ndiscrimination has been alleged.  Further, Garza has been criticized.  See Meza v. Galvin, 322 F. \nSupp. 2d 52, 62-63 n.13 (D. Mass. 2004) (noting that the Ninth Circuit‘s holding ―‗that, to the \nextent that Gingles does require a majority showing, it does so only in a case where there has \nbeen no proof of intentional dilution of minority voting strength‘ . . . is a bit puzzling‖ because \n―the principal difference in proof between a § 2 vote dilution case and one brought under the \n14th Amendment resides in the necessity to prove intent in the latter but not the former‖).  The \nGarza court‘s holding is also questionable because its rationale – that application of the Gingles \nrequirements would prevent redress for redistricting deliberately designed to prevent minorities \nfrom electing representatives in future elections – forgets that relief for intentional discrimination \nis potentially available under the Equal Protection Clause.   \nNor did the Supreme Court recognize ―compelling reasons‖ for not applying Gingles to \nintentional vote dilution claims in Bartlett v. Strickland, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1246 (2009), as \nPlaintiffs claim; rather, the Court concluded that because the case did not involve allegations of \nintentional conduct, it did not need to ―consider whether intentional discrimination affects the \nGingles analysis‖ – indicating a presumption that Gingles would apply.  In addition, to the extent \nthat Bartlett noted the view of the United States, that view only pertained to the first Gingles \nrequirement, not Gingles as a whole.  Id.  United States v. Brown, 561 F.3d 420, 427 (5th Cir. \n2009), did not involve redistricting, and thus the Gingles requirements were irrelevant.  \nSimilarly, Baird v. Consolidated City of Indianapolis, 976 F.2d 357, 359-60 (7th Cir. 1992), \ninvolved only an effects claim and not an intentional claim, and the statement Plaintiffs quote \nwas dicta and considered discrimination by means other than redistricting.  Finally, Dillard v. \nBaldwin, 686 F. Supp. 1459 (M.D. Ala. 1988), considered an intentional claim under the VRA \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 4 of 13 PageID #:734\nunnecessarily – having already found the VRA was violated under an effects analysis – and its \nanalysis of intent is not based on the redistricting case law.   \nFinally, Defendants do not argue that a claim for intentional vote dilution cannot be \nbrought under the VRA, as Plaintiffs‘ contend (Pls.‘ Resp. 2-3); intent may be considered as \nadditional evidence of dilution in the totality-of-circumstances analysis.  See Johnson, 72 F.3d at \n1564-65 (11th Cir. 1996) (holding that ―proof of intent . . . is circumstantial evidence of \ndiscriminatory results that should be considered in assessing the ‗totality of the circumstances‘‖); \naccord Meza, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 74. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have failed either to show that a mere allegation of intent relieves \nPlaintiffs of establishing the Gingles preconditions for a Section 2 claim or to explain why it \nshould.  Plaintiffs‘ failure to allege the first Gingles requirement, that another majority Latino \ndistrict beyond District 4 could be created, and to sufficiently allege the second and third Gingles \nrequirements, and now their concession that they cannot meet the Gingles requirements, defeat \ntheir Section 2 claim.  They do not vault over those required preconditions merely by using the \nword ―intentional.‖ \nII.  Plaintiffs Have Not Alleged Sufficient Facts to Support a Dilution Claim Under the \nFourteenth Amendment or Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n \nPlaintiffs contend that they have alleged sufficient facts relevant to a totality-of-the-\ncircumstances analysis to support a dilution claim under the  Fourteenth Amendment Equal \nProtection Clause or Section 2 (relevant only if Plaintiffs meet the Gingles preconditions), \narguing that they have alleged a lack of proportionality, racial polarization in voting, a history of \ndiscrimination, packing, and irregular procedure.  Plaintiffs‘ allegations in each of these areas are \nflawed, however. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 5 of 13 PageID #:735\n  Plaintiffs mischaracterize their allegations respecting two of these factors.  First, \nPlaintiffs claim to have alleged a history of discrimination, but in reality, the full extent of \nPlaintiffs‘ allegations is that ―A Latino majority district with a very similar shape was created in \nthe same location after the 1990 census in judicial proceedings over redistricting‖ and ―Judicial \nproceedings concerning the post-1990 District 4 established that race – that is, Latino ethnicity – \nwas the predominant consideration in the creation of that district.‖  (Compl. ¶¶ 60-61.)  \nPlaintiffs‘ Complaint does not even cite the cases that constitute the large majority of this \nparagraph of their Response, let alone allege a history of discrimination against Latinos affecting \nvoter turnout or a history of electoral discrimination.  (See Pls.‘ Resp. 5.)   \nSecond, Plaintiffs likewise claim that they allege irregularities in the redistricting process \nsuggestive of intentional discrimination against Latino voters, when in fact not one of their \nallegations regarding the redistricting process even mentions Latino voters.  Rather, their \nallegations about irregular procedure relate pointedly to Plaintiffs‘ partisan gerrymander claims.  \nFor example: ―State Senator Kwame Raoul, a Democrat, and House Majority Leader Barbara \nFlynn Currie, also a Democrat – controlled the conduct of the hearings‖; ―pursuant to a rule \nestablished by the Democratic chairpersons of the committees, members of the public were not \npermitted to ask questions‖; ―Republican legislators . . . implored the Democratic leadership of \nthe committees to release proposed maps . . .‖; and before the start of Memorial Day weekend, \n―the Democratic leadership of the Redistricting Committees released a proposed Congressional \nMap, SB 1178, for the first time.‖  (Compl. ¶¶ 38-45, emphasis added.) \nDefendants‘ Motion to Dismiss explained flaws in the other two factors – proportionality \nand polarized voting – to which Plaintiffs fail to offer any effective response.  Plaintiffs argue \nthat they alleged proportionality, pointing to their allegation that Latinos constitute 15.8% of \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 6 of 13 PageID #:736\nIllinois‘s population and 24.0% of Cook County‘s population, but the ―proper benchmark‖ for \nmeasuring proportionality is citizen voting-age population (CVAP), and Plaintiffs nowhere \nallege a lack of proportionality considering CVAP.  Quoted in full, the statement Plaintiffs point \nto in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006) (LULAC), reads:  \n―We proceed now to the totality of the circumstances, and first to the proportionality inquiry, \ncomparing the percentage of total districts that are Latino opportunity districts with the Latino \nshare of the citizen voting-age population.‖ 548 U.S. at 436 (emphasis added); see also Barnett \nv. City of Chicago, 141 F.3d 699, 704 (7th Cir. 1998).  As for polarized voting, the Motion to \nDismiss pointed out that the Complaint failed to allege polarized voting specific to Cook County, \nan inquiry the Court has explicitly required to be district specific.  Further, Plaintiffs simply \nrestate the required showing in a conclusory fashion:  ―Traditionally, elections in Illinois have \nbeen racially and ethnically polarized.‖  (Compl. ¶ 57.)  Plaintiffs‘ Response does not give a \nreason to overlook these flaws.  Finally, Plaintiffs point to their allegations that the State packed \nDistrict 4 with Latino voters and reduced Latino voters in Districts 3 and 5, but these allegations \namount to no more than the minimum circumstances that underlie a dilution claim.    \nPlaintiffs thus have not alleged any facts relevant to the totality-of-the-circumstances \nanalysis employed under the Equal Protection Clause or Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  \nConsidered as a whole, their allegations could not support a plausible conclusion that the \nCongressional Map operates to further racial discrimination by diluting Latino voting strength or \nthat Latino voters‘ right to vote is denied or abridged under the Map.  Consequently, Counts I \nand II should be dismissed. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 7 of 13 PageID #:737\nIII.  The Racial Gerrymander Plaintiff Has Not Stated a Sufficient Claim \n  The Motion to Dismiss explained that the Racial Gerrymander Plaintiff fails to state a  \nclaim because the Complaint contains an allegation that in fact undermines the plausibility that \nrace was the predominant factor motivating the crafting of District 4—the allegation that the \nCongressional Map has preserved the core of District 4 since the 1990 census.  (Defs.‘ Mot. to \nDismiss 7-8.)  In his response, Plaintiff attempts to discount the force of this fact by arguing that \nrespect of this traditional districting principle – preserving existing districts – continues \n―entrenched racial discrimination,‖ citing King v. State Board of Elections, 979 F. Supp. 582 \n(N.D. Ill. 1996).  (Pls.‘ Resp. 9.)  But the King court concluded that District 4 remedied a VRA \nviolation, rather than discriminated against Latinos or any other ethnicity.  King, 979 F. Supp. at \n617.  Moreover, Plaintiff entirely fails to respond to the fact that preservation of the core of \nDistrict 4 explains the shape and demographics of the District.  As he highlights in his response, \nPlaintiff‘s only allegation relevant to a racial gerrymander, other than his allegations regarding \nthe shape and demographics of District 4, is the fact that it was drawn over two decades ago, a \nremotely probative allegation at best.  It is Plaintiff‘s burden to allege facts sufficient to state a \nplausible racial gerrymander claim, and Plaintiff has failed to do so; consequently, Count IV \nshould be dismissed for failure to state a claim.  See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916-17 \n(1995). \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ Racial Dilution Claim is not Actionable under the Fifteenth Amendment \n  Regarding Count III, Plaintiffs‘ Response ignores the central focus of Defendants‘ \nMotion to Dismiss: Over five decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence has established that, \nunless a redistricting scheme seeks to ―deny the vote,‖ ―confine and restrict the voting \nfranchise,‖ or ―exclude . . . from voting‖ a class of voters on the basis of race, no cause of action \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 8 of 13 PageID #:738\nlies under the Fifteenth Amendment.  See Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 513-14 (2000); Reno \nv. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U.S. 320, 334 n. 3 (2000) (―It is established that the Supreme \nCourt has ―never held that vote dilution violates the Fifteenth Amendment . . . [it] never even \n‗suggested‘ as much‖) (citations omitted); Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 65 (1980) (plurality \nopinion) (stating that the Fifteenth Amendment does not entail the right to have candidates of \nany certain race elected; once finding that African Americans in Mobile, Alabama ―‗register and \nvote without hindrance,‘ the District Court and Court of Appeals were in error in believing that \nthe appellants invaded the protection of [the Fifteenth] Amendment in the present case‖) \n(citations omitted). \n  Neither of the cases cited by Plaintiffs (which both rely primarily on Gomillion v. \nLightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960), the lodestar for all Fifteenth Amendment redistricting litigation) \nsustains their Fifteenth Amendment claim.  As Plaintiffs‘ Response highlights, Hastert v. State \nBoard of Elections, 777 F. Supp. 634 (N.D. Ill. 1991), states only that racial gerrymandering – \nnot an alleged vote dilution – could be actionable under the Fifteenth Amendment.  777 F.Supp. \nat 645.2  And Page v. Bartels, 248 F.3d 175 (3rd Cir. 2001), stands only for the self-evident \nproposition that a redistricting scheme that intends to deprive a minority group of the right to \nvote may violate the Fifteenth Amendment.  248 F.3d at 193.3   \n                       \n2 Hastert was decided nearly a decade before the Supreme Court‘s decisions in Rice and Bossier Parrish \nconfirmed that a vote dilution claim cannot lie under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The court in Polish \nAmerican Congress v. City of Chicago, 211 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (N.D. Ill. 2002), explicitly acknowledged \nthese cases when it dismissed plaintiffs‘ vote dilution claim because the Fifteenth Amendment ―has been \nsuccessfully invoked only by plaintiffs who allege government interference with their abilities to register \nto vote or to cast ballots in elections because of their race or color.‖  211 F. Supp. at 1107 (citations \nomitted). \n \n3  Furthermore, Bartels involved only whether a Fifteenth Amendment claim was so ―frivolous or \ninsubstantial‖ that there would be no jurisdiction for a three-judge panel to hear a redistricting-related \nclaim.  Bartels, 248 F.3d at 192-93 (―Even were we to interpret the Court‘s statement in its bench opinion \nthat ‗there is no likelihood that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on the merits‘ as a comment on the \nconstitutional, as well as the statutory, claims, it cannot properly be characterized as a ruling that \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 9 of 13 PageID #:739\n  Gomillion itself had nothing to do with vote dilution.  Instead, it related to legislation that \nwas ―solely concerned with segregating white and colored voters by fencing Negro citizens out \nof town so as to deprive them of their pre-existing municipal vote.‖ 364 U.S. at 341 (emphasis \nadded).  Plaintiffs here allege no such deprivation of their right to vote, which remains entirely \nintact.  As such, Count III is insufficient to state a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.   \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Refusal to Provide Any Standard by Which to Analyze Their Partisan \n  Gerrrymander Claims Mandates Their Dismissal \n \n  As argued at length in the Motion to Dismiss, unless Plaintiffs identify a reliable standard \nby which this Court can judge their partisan gerrymander claims, these claims should be \ndismissed.  Rather than argue that they meet this requirement in their response, Plaintiffs admit \nthat the Complaint does not offer any standard (let alone a reliable one) by which to measure \ntheir claims.  (See Pls.‘ Resp. 10, n.3) (―[T]he Complaint does not say anything about a \nstandard‖).  This admission alone is fatal to their partisan gerrymander claims.4   \n  Simply put, unless a plaintiff provides a reliable standard by which to measure a partisan \ngerrymander claim, that claim must be dismissed.  In Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004), the \nSupreme Court upheld the dismissal of plaintiffs‘ complaint because it did not properly plead a \nreliable standard by which to measure a partisan gerrymander claim.  541 U.S. at 313 (Kennedy, \nJ., concurring) (absent ―a standard by which to measure the burden [plaintiffs] claim has been \nimposed on their representational rights, [they] cannot establish that the alleged political \n                                                                        \nPlaintiffs‘ constitutional claims are insubstantial, as it is well-established that a district court‘s conclusion \nthat a party will lose [or is likely to lose] on the merits of a claim is not equivalent to a conclusion of \nfrivolousness for the purposes of establishing jurisdiction‖) (citations omitted). \n \n4 Plaintiffs also contend that, ―[i]f anything, it is Defendants who must offer an acceptable standard that \nthe Complaint fails to meet.‖  (Pls.‘ Resp. 10, emphasis original.)  The cases cited by Plaintiffs offer no \nsupport for this claim, which would revolutionize federal pleading standards.  More importantly, \nhowever, it is precisely Plaintiffs‘ failure to provide this Court with any standard (let alone a reliable one) \nthat is the ―legal insufficiency‖ that dooms their partisan gerrymander claims. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 10 of 13 PageID #:740\nclassifications burden those same rights‖);5 accord LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 418 (2006) \n(opinion of Kennedy, J.) (―[A] successful claim attempting to identify unconstitutional acts of \npartisan gerrymandering must . . . show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, on the \ncomplainants‘ representational rights‖).  To credit Plaintiffs‘ argument, this Court would also \nhave to ignore Vieth and LULAC. \n  In any event, Plaintiffs are not the first to argue that they need not provide a reliable \nstandard in support of their partisan gerrymander claims. As in this case, the plaintiffs in Perez v. \nTexas alleged that a redistricting plan was a partisan gerrymander in violation of both the Equal \nProtection Clause and the First Amendment.  See Perez v. Texas, No. 11-CA-360-OLG-JES-XR, \nslip op. at 19-20 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2011) (attached as Exhibit A).  And as in this case, when \nfaced with a motion to dismiss for failing to plead a reliable standard by which to measure their \npartisan gerrymander claims, the plaintiffs in Perez argued that they did not have to offer such a \nstandard.  Id. at 21-22.  And as in Perez, Plaintiffs‘ failure to do so here is fatal.  Id. (―The \n[plaintiffs] were given an opportunity, but they have not, as required by Vieth and LULAC, \nidentified a reliable standard by which to measure the redistricting plan‘s alleged burden on their \nrepresentational rights . . . . Because [plaintiffs] have failed to enunciate a reliable standard, their \npolitical gerrymandering claims should be dismissed on the pleadings‖). \n  The reasoning in Perez was clear (and applied even though some plaintiffs in Perez \nargued – as Plaintiffs here do not – that they should be given an opportunity to develop such a \nstandard at a later date): ―[The Supreme] Court dismissed the claim at issue in Vieth based on the \ninsufficiency of the complaint, because it did not allege a manageable standard.‖  Perez v. Texas, \n                       \n5 Justice Kennedy‘s opinion is the ―position taken by those Members [of the Court] who concurred in the \njudgments on the narrowest grounds‖ and therefore controls.  DiMa Corp. v. Town of Hallie, 185 F.3d \n823, 830 n.5 (7th Cir. 1999) (quoting Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977)). \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 11 of 13 PageID #:741\nNo. 11-CA-360-OLG-JES-XR, slip op. at 19-20 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2011) (citing Vieth at 313) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)).  As in Perez, this Court is ―bound by  \n. . . the black-letter principle that a complaint must state a valid claim for relief for litigation to \nmove forward.  Providing a ‗reliable standard‘ for measuring the burden on plaintiffs‘s \nrepresentational rights is necessary to state a claim for relief for political gerrymandering . . . . \nplaintiffs‘ failure to provide one requires dismissal of their claim.‖  Id. (citing LULAC, 548 U.S. \nat 418).   \n  As discussed in the Motion to Dismiss, given the Supreme Court decisions in Vieth and  \nLULAC, it undoubtedly would have been difficult for Plaintiffs to be the first litigants since  \nDavis v. Bendemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986), first opened the door for partisan gerrymander claims  \n25 years ago to provide a reliable standard that would allow these claims to succeed.  However,  \nby admitting that their Complaint does not – and contending that it need not – do so here, \nPlaintiffs have ensured that there is no possibility that these claims can survive.  As a result,  \nCounts V and VI should be dismissed.   \nVI.  Plaintiffs Have Alleged an Explanation for District 4 Other than Race and \nConsequently Have Pleaded Themselves Out of Court on Count IV \n \n  Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that they have not pleaded themselves out of court on \nCount IV because they have not alleged that anything other than race played a role in drawing \nDistrict 4.  As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs nowhere respond to the fact that the Complaint \nalleges that the Congressional Map, as a whole, represents a partisan gerrymander.  (Compl. ¶¶ \n131, 136; Defs.‘ Mot. to Dismiss 13-14.)  Regardless of their arguments regarding the specific \nallegations in Paragraphs 5, 85, 95, and 96 of the Complaint, therefore, Plaintiffs have alleged \nthat partisanship explains the shape of the district.  Moreover, Plaintiffs‘ arguments that the \nspecific allegations do not provide an alternate explanation for District 4 lack credibility.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 12 of 13 PageID #:742\nPlaintiffs‘ claim that the allegations regarding District 5 do not undermine the required showing \nthat race was the predominant factor in the drawing of District 4 fails to acknowledge that, as a \nbordering district, District 5‘s shape by definition affects the shape of District 4.  Plaintiffs assert \nthat their allegation that District 4 protects a Democratic incumbent actually supports the idea \nthat race and not politics motivated District 4 because it was the lowest population overlap of all \nDemocratic incumbents‘ districts, but Plaintiffs nonetheless still have alleged an alternate \npolitical explanation, and moreover, the ―lowest‖ overlap remains substantial at 69.38%.  \n(Compl. ¶ 95.)  Finally, Plaintiffs‘ claim that their allegation regarding the division of two \ncommunities making up a sizeable portion of District 4 does not allege whether partisanship or \nrace motivated the divisions is similarly wishful, in that the allegation is within Section IV.D of \nthe Complaint, entitled ―The Proposed Congressional Plan is Gerrymandered to \nDisproportionately Favor Democratic Candidates.‖  (Compl. 16, emphasis added.)    \nAs Plaintiffs have clearly alleged an explanation other than race for the crafting of District 4, \nPlaintiffs have pleaded themselves out of court on Count IV.  \nVII.  Plaintiffs’ Contingent Request for Leave to File Amended Complaint \n  Without an opportunity to analyze any Amended Complaint‘s legal and factual contours, \nas well as the impact it would have on the scheduling and discovery timeline upon which \nPlaintiffs have been insistent, it is impossible for Defendants to take a position on the issue at \nthis time.  Defendants therefore reserve the right to respond in full if, and when, Plaintiffs \nformally request leave to file it. \nConclusion \n  WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that this Court dismiss Plaintiffs‘ \nComplaint with prejudice. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:11-cv-05065 Document #: 78 Filed: 10/12/11 Page 13 of 13 PageID #:743\n \nDate:  October 12, 2011        Respectfully submitted, \n \n              LISA MADIGAN,  \nAttorney General for the State of Illinois \n \n \n                           /s/ Brent D.
