On review of the status report, R. 466, without counting the Cabrini Rowhouses, the CHA still estimates that the remaining Cabrini deliverable units will reach the 700 requirement by 3Q 2025; the Parkside 5 delivery is estimated for 3Q 2024; and the Clybourn and Larrabee Phase 1 delivery is still estimated for 3Q 2025. (2.) The parties have started conferrals on the joint motion to discharge Temporary Custodian and to transition to Monitor. By the next status report, the Court does expect the parties either to have filed the motion or to explain in the status report a deadline for doing so. (3.). The status hearing of 06/05/2024 is reset to a phone status hearing on 10/08/2024 at 9:30 a.m. A written status report is due on 10/01/2024. If any party wishes to advance the date, then counsel may email the courtroom deputy to request an earlier date. Members of the public and media will be able to call-in to listen to this hearing. The call-in number is (650) 479-3207 and the access code 180 384 7218##. Counsel of record will receive an email before the start of the telephonic hearing with instructions to join the call. Persons granted remote access to proceedings are reminded of the general prohibition against photographing, recording, and rebroadcasting of court proceedings.

The Court notes that the OIG report was issued on 05/21/2020, and the CHA's motion 230 was filed on 07/21/2020 (the Court is not faulting the CHA for the time delay, and conferral before filing the motion likely consumed time too, but still it points out the need for a bit of time on the underlying motion). On the freeze motion 242, the LAC shall respond as best as it can by 08/11/2020. The CHA may reply by 08/18/2020. It might make sense for the interim relief, if any, first to comprise not a freeze but a contemporaneous, same-day provision of receipts and records to the CHA for any expenditures, and no petty-cash withdrawals without a motion to the court for approval detailing the anticipated need.

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Edmond E. Chang: On review of the status report on the settlement negotiations, R. 287, although the parties report some meaningful progress, the time has come to set a litigation schedule so that the negotiations reach a conclusion one way or the other. The CHA's motion 230 to modify and to enforce the decree, R. 230, was filed back on 07/22/2020. Over six months have passed since the motion's filing, and over four months since the first 10/02/2020 settlement-conference session. It is true that the pandemic has slowed the pace of most cases, but more than six months is extraordinary and there is no definitive end in sight. Of course, the parties should make every effort to successfully conclude the negotiations, but the litigation schedule must begin. First, the CHA shall file a supplement to the motion 230 to modify and to enforce, providing any additional facts that might support its position. The CHA's supplement is due by 02/12/2021. By 03/01/2021, the LAC and the CDC may file separate responses (and Carole Steele may file a separate one too, if she chooses). The CHA may reply by 03/08/2021. The evidentiary hearing shall be held via video on 03/18/2021 at 9:30 a.m. Based on the Court's prior review of the OIG Report, it might be necessary to admonish certain witnesses of their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, which might in turn result in adverse inferences. By 03/11/2021, the CHA, LAC, and CDC shall file exhibit and witness lists (including adverse witnesses), and shall serve digital PDF copies of exhibits on one another and on the Court (contact the courtroom deputy to arrange to drop off thumb drives or DVDs, or possibly to use a file-dropbox system). The exhibits shall be numbered, per each party, with consecutive numbers and neutral file names using the JERS Exhibits instructions on Judge Chang's website (available at the Proposed Pretrial Orders and JERS link) The Court will distribute video-link information to the parties and post public-access information on the docket as the date approaches. The tracking status hearing of 02/05/2021 is reset to 02/19/2021 at 8:30 a.m., but to track the case only (no appearance is required, the case will not be called). Emailed notice (Chang, Edmond) (Entered: 01/31/2021)"

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Edmond E. Chang: Telephonic status hearing held with counsel for the parties and counsel for the CDC and Carol Steele. Counsel for the LAC, the City, and the CHA reported that the parties have reached a settlement on material terms that would obviate the need for the evidentiary hearing, and that the LAC Board has formally voted and approved the terms. Evidentiary hearing set for 03/18/2021 is vacated. The CDC reported that it objects to at least some aspects of the settlement. The LAC's motion to enter an order that embodies the settlement terms is due by 03/17/2021. A copy of the proposed order and minutes of the LAC Board meeting that approved the settlement shall be attached to motion. Given the broad authority vested in the LAC Board by the CDC By-Laws, and given the need for prompt action, a telephone motion hearing set for 03/18/2021 at 1:30 p.m. The CDC may orally respond to the motion at the 03/18/2021 hearing. The parties are reminded that the prior Monitoring Order of 08/22/2020 remains in place and the Court expects full compliance with it. Members of the public and media will be able to call-in to listen to the 03/18/2021 hearing. The call-in number is (877) 336-1831 and the access code is 1736479.

Chang: Telephonic motion hearing on the Plaintiff's agreed motion to enter settlement order 324 held with counsel for the parties and counsel for the CDC. Although the parties believe that a binding settlement agreement has been formed, the Court orders further briefing to complete the record. First, by 5:00 p.m. on 03/18/2021, (a) the minutes of the 08/18/2020 recusal, and any related records, as well as (b) any records related to the purported 03/17/2021 LAC vote to \"overturn\" the proposal, will be disclosed by counsel for the CDC (who has access to them through Steele and Dillon) to the Plaintiff and to the Defendants. Then, by 03/22/2021, the Plaintiff shall file a supplement to the motion, attaching the recusal records and the By-Laws of the LAC (and anything else that is relevant), in support of the effectiveness of the 03/16/2021 LAC adoption of the settlement. Also, by 03/22/2021, the Defendants may file a supplement requesting enforcement of the settlement agreement, if they believe that a binding settlement agreement was entered into on 03/16/2021. Next, the CDC shall respond to the motion by 03/29/2021, attaching (along with anything else that is relevant) the records pertaining to the 03/17/2021 purported LAC vote to \"overturn\" the proposal (unless the Plaintiff's supplement already attached them). The Plaintiff and the Defendants may reply by 04/02/2021. Continued telephone motion hearing set for 04/06/2021 at 10:00 a.m. If the settlement order is not approved, then the parties shall be prepared for the video evidentiary hearing on 04/26/2021 at 9:30 a.m. The parties and the CDC again shall subpoena witnesses or otherwise secure their availability. Also, for the sake of a more efficient and accurate hearing, the Court orders that Lischka, Steele, and Hollie shall be available for a deposition on or before 04/19/2021. Separately, as discussed at the hearing, the CDC has not been complying with the monitoring order. ***ANY CURRENTLY MISSING OR INCOMPLETE RECORDS shall be provided no later than 4 p.m. on 03/22/2021.*** And no further missing or incomplete disclosures will be tolerated.

Chang: On review of the CHA's motion to compel and for other relief 339, Carole Steele's extension motion 340 for time to respond, and the CHA's objection, R. 341, the Court orders as follows: first, given the untimely submissions in violation of the Interim Order, R. 254, the CHA is immediately authorized to serve subpoenas on any financial institutions and credit-card companies holding the accounts of the Cabrini Green LAC Community Development Corporation (CDC). The subpoenas may seek records relating to the CDC from 03/24/2021 to the present, as well as onward prospectively until further order of the Court. Second, given the absence of supporting records on the engagement of Travaughn Steele for janitorial or driver services, they shall immediately and temporarily cease any payments to Mr. Steele for any purported services rendered on or after 05/28/2021. The CDC may seek to resume payments by filing a motion with supporting grounds and evidence. Third, Steele's extension motion 340 to respond to the CHA's motion is granted to 06/01/2021, as requested, given that the motion seeks relief against her. Plaintiff LAC also may respond, if it wishes to take a position or supply information, on 06/01/2021. The CHA may reply by 06/08/2021. Lastly, Carole Steele emailed a document to the magistrate judge, and the magistrate judge forwarded the document to Judge Chang at Steele's request. Because Steele is represented by counsel, the Court will not be considering the document, because pro se filings are not permitted when a case participant is represented by counsel. Any information in the document that Steele wishes to present to the Court must be done so through her counsel. Emailed notice (mw, ) (Entered: 05/26/2021)"

The parties shall also be prepared to update the Court on the proposed caretaker board members and, if agreement has not been reached, the City and CHA shall be prepared to discuss their objections.

Third, to the extent that the motion seeks interim payments before the appointment of the Temporary Custodian, see R. 342, again no evidence was submitted with the motion to support the prior payments.

Chang: On review of the status report, R. 382, and the docket more generally, the Court immediately authorizes both the Cabrini-Green Local Advisory Council (LAC) and the Community Development Corporation (CDC) to serve subpoenas on any person or entity who may possess (or have the ability to control) any records or property of the CDC. That includes a subpoena to attorney Anthony Burch for the client file relating to the CDC, including the written retainer with the CDC; all itemized invoices; all records reflecting hours, activities, and hourly rate regarding representation of the CDC; and all correspondence, papers, and property belonging to the CDC. This authority also includes a subpoena to Carole Steele for any records or property of the CDC. The specification of Burch and Steele is not a limitation on the authority to issue subpoenas to others who possess or control records or property of the CDC. Subpoenas are deemed returnable no later than five business days after service, absent the filing of a motion to quash within the five-day period. On 09/28/2021, the LAC shall file a supplemental status report stating whether Burch complied with the existing 09/24/2021 demand deadline referred to in the status report. Separately, the Court resets the phone hearing of 09/23/2021 to 10/04/2021 at 9 a.m., as it is working on posting an order addressing the use of CDC funds that happened before the installation of the Temporary Custodian. Members of the public and media will be able to call-in to listen to this hearing. The call-in number is (877) 336-1831 and the access code is 1736479. Counsel of record will receive an email before the start of the telephonic hearing with instructions to join the call. Persons granted remote access to proceedings are reminded of the general prohibition against photographing, recording, and rebroadcasting of court proceedings.

On the Revised Transition Plan, Debra Claybron provided a status update, including that there are six potential candidates and the packages will be submitted for review. Ms. Claybron also explained that the timeline has been pushed back for around one month, and will share the new anticipated timeline with the parties. The Court discussed the D&O insurance references (which now has been procured by CDC), and suggested that it be made clear that the CDC is paying for the insurance. There are ongoing conferrals about the van, and the parties will ask the magistrate judge for assistance if needed. (3.) The CHA raised the topic of the gift-card giveaway, and Ms. Claybron and Mr. Maurice Edwards provided their views. As discussed at the hearing, the transparency by the Temporary Custodian and Mr. Edwards is a hugely positive step, and there should be no impugning the motivation or intention. It is important to refer to the governing Consent Decree and Agreed Order, as well as the corporate by-laws, in exercising judgment on this issue. If conferrals are not successful, then the parties should request the help of the magistrate judge. (4.) A tracking status hearing on the prior motions for relief is set for 02/11/2022 at 8:30 a.m., but to track the case only (no appearance is required, the case will not be called). (5.) By 03/21/2022, the parties shall file a written status report. A telephone status hearing is set for 03/04/2022 at 2:00 p.m. Members of the public and media will be able to call-in to listen to the hearing. The call-in number is (877) 336-1831 and the access code is 1736479. Counsel of record will receive an email before the start of the telephonic hearing with instructions to join the call.

The full nine-member CDC Board is now complete and is duly constituted. (2.) On the residential-unit deliverable requirements, the Plaintiff reported that it still disputes the rehabbed rowhouses (146 units) as counting toward the 700 units. As discussed during the hearing, if the number of deliverables towards the consent decree requirement would otherwise be met in a timely way without the rehabbed rowhouses, then the parties may agree to pause on seeking a Court decision on the issue. But if the decree would otherwise drag on if the dispute is not definitively resolved, then the parties must brief the issue. The parties shall confer on this issue and report on it in the next status report. (2.) On the transition plan, the timeline required adjustment given the board-formation and other obstacles. Ms. Claybron reported that the target dates have been drafted and disseminated to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff's counsel, and the CDC Board. Comments from those stakeholders must be returned to Ms. Claybron by 09/09/2022. The final adjusted timeline shall then be provided submitted to the CHA and the City by 09/16/2022. Of course, if the update can be circulated quicker, then the prompter path should be taken. (3.)

On review of the written status report, R. 464, without counting the Cabrini Rowhouses, the CHA estimates that the remaining deliverable units (of the total of 700) will be completed by 3Q 2025. The overall delay from Q4 2024, see R. 461, 462, arises in part from budget gaps caused by interest-rate increases. (2.) The Temporary Custodian has been compensated for all services through 12/31/2023, and the parties anticipate filing a joint motion to discharge the Temporary Custodian and to transition her to the role of Monitor, see R. 355, para. 1(e). (3.) The Court thanks the parties for providing the written status report. The status hearing of 02/20/2024 is reset to 06/05/2024 at 9:30 a.m. A written status report is due on 05/31/2024. If any party wishes to advance the date, then counsel are directed to email the courtroom deputy, to request an earlier date. Members of the public and media will be able to call-in to listen to this hearing. The call-in number is (650) 479-3207 and the access code is 180 384 7218##. Counsel of record will receive an email before the start of the telephonic hearing with instructions to join the call. Persons granted remote access to proceedings are reminded of the general prohibition against photographing, recording, and rebroadcasting of court proceedings. Violation of these prohibitions may result in sanctions, including removal of court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court.

The proposed modification appears to be a subset of a broader modification in the broader (and lead) case, Gautreaux v. CHA, 66 C 1459, in which there is also a pending motion for modification. It seems sensible to defer in the first instance to a decision in the broader case before acting on the modification proposed in this case. Accordingly, the motion hearing of 09/16/2015 is reset to 09/24/2015 at 9:30 a.m., with the goal of deferring to Gautreaux before acting on this motion. If the Court has misunderstood the situation, then the parties may file a supplement to the motion explaining why this Court should act first. Emailed notice (slb, ) (Entered: 09/14/2015)"

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Edmond E. Chang: Telephonic pre-evidentiary hearing status held. (1.) (A.) On witness planning (witness lists are due on 03/11/2021), the LAC does not plan on calling witnesses, but would question witnesses called by others. The defense might call around 10 witnesses, including LAC and CDC board members, professional advisors, 2-3 CHA employees, the OIG investigator, and possibly a few development partners. The CDC might call 6 witnesses, including a forensic accountant (whose report would be filed as part of the upcoming proposed exhibits). On or before 03/09/2021, the case participants (which includes the CDC) shall confer in an attempt to narrow down the factual disputes that require live testimony. As the Court noted, much of the LAC and CDC respective responses do not dispute many of the underlying facts, and instead really only dispute inferences or conclusions to be drawn from them. It is in everyone's interest (including the potential witnesses) to streamline the live testimony. The Court is willing to consider a reasonable continuance if the case participants can narrow the scope of the live testimony. In any event, regardless of who calls a witness (including as an adverse witness), the other participants must be ready to conduct their examination of the witness immediately afterwards, rather than recalling the witness. (B.) As part of the 03/09/2021 conferral, counsel for the case participants must discuss the production of the witnesses, either by subpoena or by voluntary appearance, and even if counsel is not formally representing a witness, counsel should endeavor to be the means of communication to facilitate appearances. The same goes for ensuring the video-conferencing capability of the witnesses (if video is a problem for a particular witness, the case participants shall discuss whether phone testimony is acceptable). (C.) The Court will hear closing arguments no sooner than 2 days after the close of the evidentiary hearing. (2.) On exhibits, during the 03/09/2021 conferral, counsel must discuss the best way to distribute exhibits to witnesses. As the Court explained during the hearing, paper copies for each witness might be necessary to ensure the best presentation, due to the limits of share-screen display or digital access by each witness. The Court discussed the likely admissibility of the OIG Report under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(A)(iii), although the case participants may objection to its admissibility at the hearing. In addition to being proper under the rule, allowing the OIG Report into evidence also might facilitate a more efficient hearing; the LAC and the CDC could still dispute the report and its evidentiary weight, but there would not be a need to repeat the Report through live testimony. (3.) As explained during the hearing, by 03/08/2021 at 12 p.m., the CDC shall file an Additional Response to correct the repeated paragraph in R. 303 at 31, limited to two pages. Separately, the CHA's reply is extended to 03/09/2021 without objection. (4.)

On Decree Section III(A)(6), counsel for the LAC is unaware whether a hardship fund was ever established, but anticipates discussing the matter with the CDC after the appointment of the Temporary Custodian and the three caretaker Board members. (5.) On Decree Section V(B), in the next status report, the CHA shall provide information on how it has kept the displaced-family database up to date and how many families remain in the database. (6.) On Decree Section I(G), in the next status report, the parties shall set forth their positions on the 40-year period referred to in that section, and how that might impact the length of oversight in federal court, with the goal of minimizing the need for protracted oversight. (7.) Periodic reporting will be required to minimize the repeat of the CDC problems and to ensure that the Decree's requirements are accomplished in a reasonable time period.

On the return of funds, counsel for the Plaintiff reported that Lynell Dillon's monthly payments are up to date (another was provided last week, at least according to a receipt from a Caretaker Board member). There appears to be around $800 left to be paid back. The counsel for the Plaintiff shall email the courtroom deputy the terms of the settlement agreement between Dillon and the CDC to report on how many payments remain at this point. ***The Court ORDERS that Lynell Dillon comply with the monthly payment schedule.*** (2.) On the Transition Plan, the CDC Caretaker Board and Temporary Custodian Debra Clayborn continue to finalize a draft, which will be shared with the defense after its finalization. The magistrate judge continues to supervise the transition to the eventual new CDC Board. The goal is for the new Board to be appointed by the end of 2021 and trained by the end of Q1 of 2022. (3.) By 10/18/2021, the CDC shall file a concise Position Paper addressing whether the CDC wishes to seek any further relief at this time as to payments made to attorney Burch or to former CDC Board members and officers. For the sake of conserving resources, the CDC might decide against seeking further relief, but the Court should obtain this information in writing on the docket. (4.) The Plaintiffs' counsel described the personal injury suit in Cook County Circuit Court, and the retention of a lawyer by CDC to vacate the default and defend against it. (5.) Conferral continues on whether the 146 rehabbed row units delivered in 2009 count towards the 700-unit requirement. The defense position is that, by the end of Q3 in 2023, the Defendants will have delivered the required number of units. That does depend, however, on the 146 units being counted. The Plaintiff pointed out that the requirement might reached in 2024 even without the 146 units. In any event, the parties shall continue to confer, and if needed later, the Court will set a briefing schedule on the dispute. (5.) On or before 12/13/2021, the parties shall file a joint status report, including on the anticipated new Board. (6.)

The CHA reported that it is still on track for the Q2 of 2024 completion of the units. As the completion date approaches next year, the parties shall start conferring on what hopefully would be an agreed motion to terminate the decree. (3.) The defense recently raised three issues with the Plaintiff; two are scheduled for conferral. The third was the absence of payments to the Temporary Custodian for work after 05/2022. The Temporary Custodian will finish submitting all bills for work through 07/2023 by 08/18/2023; payments for work through 03/2023 were made last week. (4.) A telephone status hearing is set for 11/21/2023 at 9:30 a.m. The parties shall also file a joint status report on 11/14/2023, reporting on (a) whether the unit completion date remains in place; and (b) the overall case and anything else the parties want to address with the Court.

    "summary": "<p>On October 23, 1996, Cabrini-Green Local Advisory Council (LAC), a tenant organization that represents the tenants of Cabrini-Green, a family public housing development in Chicago, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiff sued the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and its Executive Director under the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, HOPE VI, the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, and the the Uniform Relocation Act. Plaintiffs also brought eight state law claims. The complaint alleged that the CHA's plan to \"revitalize\" Cabrini-Green would displace Cabrini-Green residents and reduce the supply of affordable housing units, thereby resulting in a discriminatory impact upon African Americans, women, and children. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 3, 1997, the Honorable David H. Coar denied plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction to the extent that it sought to enjoin the removal of residents from some of the buildings involved in the revitalization plan. However, the court enjoined CHA from taking any steps to demolish those buildings. On January 21, the court dismissed four of plaintiff's twenty-two counts with prejudice. <em>Cabrini-Green Loc. Advisory Council v. Chicago Hous. Auth.</em>, No. 96 C 6949, 1997 WL 31002 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 22, 1997).</p>\r\n<p>On April 3, 1997, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to add the City of Chicago and the Mayor of Chicago, Richard M. Daley, as defendants. After more than a year of discovery, settlement conferences began in April of 1998. On May 1, 1998, the parties reached agreement in principle to settle the case, subject to drafting agreement and seeking necessary court approval. In a minute order on March 2, 1999, the court denied the Mayor's motion to dismiss, CHA's motion for summary judgment, and the City's motion for summary judgment. {THIS IS CONFUSING: IF THEY SETTLED, WHY WERE THESE MOTIONS PENDING?}</p>\r\n<p>Another year passed, and on August 30, 2000, the parties agreed to settle the case on the terms set forth in a consent decree. The consent decree included the establishment of a working group and resident participation in the redevelopment initiative as well as the funding and operation of replacement housing. LAC agreed to the demolition of certain buildings. The decree also outlined relocation options for families, including that displaced families would have priority to move into newly constructed public housing and affordable housing units to be constructed under the decree. In addition, the decree provided for job training and employment opportunities as well as community and supportive services. By its terms, the consent decree had to be approved by Judge Aspen in the <em>Gautreaux</em> case. <a href=\"../../../../case/11085/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Gautreaux</em></a>, one of the most significant housing desegregation cases ever, was a class-action lawsuit against the CHA in the Northern District of Illinois that alleged segregation on the part of the CHA. Once Judge Aspen approved this consent decree, Judge Coar entered the decree, and closed the case, except that the court retained jurisdiction to the extent necessary to enforce the consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>Several years later, on February 25, 2003, Section IIA of the consent decree, which pertained to the funding and operation of replacement housing, was modified. On March 17, 2004, the consent degree was again modified. The 2004 modification pertained to who was responsible for developing and administering some of the community and support services.</p>\r\n<p>On January 10, 2006, the LCA filed a motion to enforce the consent decree. A hearing was held on January 26, and the motion was concluded and terminated that same day. Just two months later, on March 31, 2006, the LCA filed a motion for a court order to reinstate their motion to enforce the consent decree. On April 6, 2006, the court did just that, entering an order for the consent decree to be enforced with respect to a particular resident. On January 29, 2007, the court granted plaintiff's second motion to enforce the consent decree, rendering as unenforceable in all current and future leases a provision that would have required eviction whenever a resident was found to have been convicted of a felony.. <em>Cabrini-Green Loc. Advisory Council v. Chicago Hous. Auth.</em>, No. 96 C 6949, 2007 WL 294253 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 29, 2007).</p>\r\n<p>On May 23, 2011, the case was reassigned to Judge Edmond E. Chang. Two months later, on August 15, Judge Chang denied plaintiff's third motion to compel enforcement of the consent decree. Per the consent decree, residential units were to be built on a specific parcel of land. In its motion, plaintiff alleged that in the eleven years since the consent decree had been in effect, the City of Chicago had neither acquired nor taken any steps to acquire the land. Because the City had made considerable progress in building a significant portion of the required residential units on other lands, though, the Court concluded that the consent decree&rsquo;s flexibility and deference demanded that the motion to compel be denied.</p>\r\n<p>On September 10, 2015, the parties filed an agreed motion to modify the consent decree. In a minute entry on September 14, Judge Chang&nbsp;stated that the proposed modification appeared to be a subset of a broader modification in the broader (and lead) case, <em>Gautreaux v. CHA</em>, in which there was also a pending motion for modification. The court deferred to the <em>Gautreaux</em> court, and when that court granted the motion to modify, so too did Judge Chang. The modification pertained to replacement housing, and according to Judge Chang, was justified because&nbsp;original sources of funding had diminished and new sources of funding (that did not exist when the decree was entered) could be tapped.</p>\r\n<p>As part of the original 2000 consent decree, private developers had to give the LAC both an ownership interest in and a share of fees and profits from certain new development projects in Cabrini-Green. However, the receipt of such funds was conditioned on the LAC only using the money &ldquo;for non-profit purposes to benefit current and displaced Cabrini-Green residents.&rdquo; In 2003, the LAC created a non-profit organization called the Cabrini-Green Local Advisory Council Community Development Corporation (CDC) to receive these funds. In December 2016, the CHA&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General (OIG) began receiving complaints that the President of both the LAC and the CDC had misappropriated CDC funds for her personal use. A May 2020 OIG report confirmed the allegations of financial mismanagement against the CDC. Given the alleged mishandling of funds, on August 22, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to preliminarily freeze the bank accounts of the CDC as well as certain members of the LAC and CDC. The court imposed financial controls and limits, but refused to impose an across-the-board freeze that would have completely disabled the CDC from operating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2021, the court ordered the appointment of a temporary custodian who would be responsible for selecting CDC board members and professional staff. While in place, the temporary custodian would work with a caretaker CDC board, followed by the new CDC board, to operate the CDC in pursuit of its charitable mission. On July 22, 2021, the court appointed a temporary custodian.</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2022, the court granted CHA's motion to compel compliance with the court's orders from August 22, 2020 and April 21, 2021. The court also granted CHA's motion for restitution orders against prior CDC board members. The court prohibited these prior CDC board members from occupying any corporate officer or director role in CDC or any other LAC operating entity that takes its place pursuant to the Consent Decree and also prohibited them from being involved in any of the LAC's responsibilities as set out in the Consent Decree.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing. On June 22, 2022, a telephone conference was held with the Temporary Custodian, in furtherance of settlement negotiations.</p>",

Chang\n)\nChicago Housing Authority and )\nthe City of Chicago,  )\n)\nDefendants. )\nORDER\nI.\nPlaintiff Cabrini-Green Local Advisory Council (LAC) has filed a motion to\ncompel [R. 203] enforcement of the Consent Decree which settled this case almost 11\nyears ago in September 2000. In the lawsuit that led to the settlement, LAC challenged\nthe Chicago Housing Authority and the City of Chicago’s redevelopment initiative of\nthe Near North area, primarily alleging that the displacement of public housing\nresidents violated federal housing laws and regulations. Among other things, the\nConsent Decree provides for the eventual construction of 700 replacement public\nhousing units and 270 affordable rental units in the defined Near North area. R. 160\n§ II.A, II.B. Furthermore, the Consent Decree specifies a required “income mix” for\nhousing developed in the area on City-owned and CHA-owned land: 50% market rate,\n20% affordable, and 30% public housing. Id. § II.D.\nIn the motion to compel, LAC seeks to enforce a specific land-acquisition and\nland-restriction provision in the Consent Decree: \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:429\nThe City will acquire additional land and/or impose appropriate\nrestrictions and requirements on land owned by other persons or entities\nto make it possible to maintain the commitment by it and by CHA to\nconstruct at least 700 public housing units and 270 affordable rental\nunits . . . . Land acquired, in the process of being acquired, or otherwise\nanticipated to be subject to appropriate restrictions and requirements for\nmixed-income development to date is described in Appendices B and C to\nthe consent decree.\nR. 160 § II.C. One of the parcels of land designated in the appendices is an 11-acre\nparcel (coincidentally designated as Parcel 11) upon which the shuttered Near North\nHigh School sits. The appendices “rough estimates” state that 382 residential units\nwould be built on the site, including 115 public housing units. The City asserts,\nwithout contradiction, that the Chicago Board of Education owned Parcel 11 in 2000\n– and still does. R. 208 at 4.1 In LAC’s view, that is the problem: the City has neither\nacquired the land nor taken any concrete steps to acquire it. Nor has the City imposed\nany restrictions on Parcel 11. \nIn addition to the sheer passage of time since 2000, LAC is also concerned that\ninaction could open the door to an alternative, non-residential use of Parcel 11. LAC\npoints to what it characterizes as a close call in late 2008 and 2009, when the Chicago\nHigh School for the Arts had proposed to the Chicago Public School (CPS) District that\nthe Arts School would occupy the former Near North High School building for three\nyears, with an option for a fourth year. See 02/19/09 Minutes of Working Group\nMeeting at 4-5 (attached as Exh. A to Zalmezak Supp. Declaration, R. 214). The Arts\n1The Board of Education of the City of Chicago is a municipal corporation with\na separate identity as a body politic. 105 ILCS 5/34-2. The Board governs the Chicago\nPublic School District.\n2\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:430\nSchool had been in discussions with CPS about the site since late Fall 2008. The LAC\nfirst learned about the discussions during a February 2009 meeting of a Working\nGroup created by the Consent Decree to monitor and review, among other things, the\nNear North redevelopment initiative, R. 160 § I.A. The City’s primary development\ncoordinator for the Near North area, Paul Zalmezak, described the situation as “what\nwe are working on right now is finalizing an agreement that gets the new high school\nout of the building in four years; it will start in August or September of this year and\nthey will be finished no later than the fourth year, which puts them at 2013.” 02/19/09\nMinutes at 4. Mr. Zalmezak explained that CPS had not been aware of the Consent\nDecree, that there was a “battle” where the City informed CPS of the Consent Decree’s\nrequirements and emphasized that the site was going to be redeveloped for housing,\nand that CPS understood. Id. at 5. Ultimately, however, the Arts School did not move\ninto the building. \nMore recently, LAC sought information from the City, in May 2011, about what\nsteps had been taken to obtain Parcel 11 for replacement housing. According to LAC,\nthe City’s lawyer stated that the City was involved in discussions about a mixed-use\nproposal that would include some housing. The City could not guarantee that the\nproposal would provide for 382 residential units, including the 115 public housing units\nlisted on the “rough estimates” appendix to the Consent Decree. \nThe City responds that it has made substantial overall progress toward meeting\nthe Consent Decree’s mandate of 700 public housing units and 270 affordable units.\nSpecifically, when combining City-owned, CHA-owned, and privately-owned land, some\n3\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:431\n395  public housing units and 111 affordable units have been completed  so  far.\nFurthermore, the City argues that the Arts School would have occupied the site only\ntemporarily, and that even if actual demolition and construction of Parcel 11 could not\nhave occurred during the Arts School’s tenancy, redevelopment planning (such as\nsoliciting and evaluating requests for proposals) could have moved forward without\ninterference during that time. The City also represents, and Mr. Zalmezak affies, that\nthe City “is committed to obtaining control of the parcel of land . . . and to cause that\nparcel to be developed with a substantial number of residential units at the 50/30/20\nincome  mix  required  by  the  Consent  Decree  .  .  .  .”  R.  208,  Exh.  A,  Zalmezak\nDeclaration ¶ 8. \nII.\nBefore assessing the competing arguments, the Court sets forth the legal\nstandards by which the motion is measured. The terms of the Consent Decree are\ninterpreted as if it were a contract – and for good reason, because the Consent Decree\nis indeed a negotiated agreement between the parties. Bailey v. Roob, 567 F.3d 930,\n940 (7th Cir. 2009) (“A court interprets the meaning of a consent decree in the same\nway it interprets the meaning of a contract . . . .”) (citing Goluba v. School Dist. of\nRipon, 45 F.3d 1035, 1037-38 (7th Cir. 1995)). In light of the contractual nature of the\nConsent Decree, during the in-court argument LAC characterized the motion to compel\nas a “motion to enforce” the contract. Ordinarily, a breach of contract must be proven\nby a mere preponderance of the evidence, and this standard has been applied by the\nSeventh Circuit to settlement agreements incorporated into a court order. Prima Tek\n4\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:432\nII v. Klerk’s Plastic Indus., 525 F.3d 533, 538 (7th Cir. 2008). But the City argues that\nthe motion to compel is in effect a motion to find the City in civil contempt, which\nrequires that the complaining party show a violation of the court order by clear and\nconvincing evidence. Bailey, 567 F.3d 934-35. \nIn one respect, there is reason to justify LAC’s view that the motion to compel\nis something short of civil contempt: in the motion, LAC does not ask for any particular\ncoercive or compensatory sanctions – at least not yet. “Civil contempt sanctions are\nproperly imposed for two reasons: to compel compliance with the court order and to\ncompensate the complainant for losses caused by contemptuous actions.” Tranzact\nTechnologies v. 1Source Worldsite, 406 F.3d 851, 855 (7th Cir. 2005). Instead of asking\nfor sanctions flowing from a civil contempt finding, LAC seems to ask only that the\nCity acquire Parcel 11 or restrict its use. In other words, LAC asks for a declaration\nthat the time has come for the City to start taking concrete steps toward an eventual\nresidential redevelopment of the site, but LAC does not yet suggest that some form of\ncoercive sanction must be immediately imposed to spur action (nor does LAC suggest\nthat a compensatory sanction is warranted). This sounds like a two-step process, where\nthere is first a finding that there is a breach of the agreement and a specific order to\ncomply, and afterwards if there is no compliance, imposition of sanctions. In light of\nthe requested relief – a declaration of a breach rather than imposition of sanctions –\nit is understandable that LAC argues that, at this stage, the motion to enforce is not\na civil contempt proceeding requiring a clear and convincing burden of proof.\n5\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:433\nBut the Seventh Circuit has explained, in Bailey v. Roob, why the higher\nstandard does apply, particularly in the context of a consent decree governing a public\nagency. 567 F.3d 937-38. In Bailey, the Indiana agency that decided Medicaid disability\neligibility entered into a consent decree to govern what medical information the State\nwould have to collect and consider before deciding an applicant’s eligibility. Many years\nafter the consent decree’s entry, the plaintiffs filed a petition to hold Indiana in\ncontempt for failing to collect “complete” medical histories of some applicants. In\ndeciding what burden of proof would apply, Bailey held that once a consent decree\ngrants relief, then the issue at the enforcement stage is whether the government\nagency is in civil contempt. Id. at 938. The Seventh Circuit repeated the Supreme\nCourt’s admonition that consent decrees over public agencies present the risk that\ndistrict courts will find themselves “deeply entangled with the development and\nmanagement of a city or state agency.” Id. at 937. Bailey thus held that “a district court\nis entitled to require clearer and more convincing evidence of non-compliance before\nimposing coercive sanctions.” Id. at 938. It is also appropriate to apply this standard\nwhen determining whether there has been a violation of the order at all, because the\nConsent Decree, even more so than the non-self-defining term “complete medical\nhistory” in Bailey, provides for some flexibility in attaining the fixed 700-unit / 270-unit\npromise and the fixed income mix. \nSo it is LAC’s burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the City has\nviolated the order based on its inaction with respect to Parcel 11. One way to prove a\n6\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:434\nviolation of the order is to show a “willful” violation. Bailey, 567 F.3d at 935. But there\nis another way: contempt will be found if the alleged contemnor “has not been\nreasonably diligent and energetic in attempting to accomplish what was ordered.” Id.\nat 935 (citing Goluba v. School Dist. of Ripon, 45 F.3d 1035, 1036 (7th Cir.1995)). That\nbest describes LAC’s argument: the City has not been reasonably diligent in obtaining\ncontrol over Parcel 11 and putting it on the path of redevelopment.\nIn light of the lack of progress spanning 11 years since the date of the Consent\nDecree’s entry, this is a close question, but the Court concludes that the Consent\nDecree’s flexibility and deference demand that the motion to compel be denied – but\nwithout prejudice. Parcel 11 is one of the largest sites identified in the Consent\nDecree’s appendices for residential redevelopment, and so LAC is understandably\nfocused on it. But the City correctly points out that, overall, it has made some progress\nin meeting the total required unit numbers in the entire Near North area. So far, the\nCity and CHA have built a combined 395 public housing units and 111 affordable units\nin the area, more than half-way to the required numbers. To be sure, 11 years has\ncome and gone since the Consent Decree’s entry, but there is no set time-table for\nreaching the required numbers, not even an aspirational time period. Moreover, as the\nCity’s redevelopment coordinator, Mr. Zalmezak, explained in his declarations, for the\npast few years neither the housing market nor the financing market has been favorable\nfor residential redevelopment in the area. There have also been, according to Mr.\nZalmezak,  competing  projects  that  have  weighed  against  proceeding  with\nredevelopment at a faster pace.\n7\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:435\nAdditionally, the City avers through Mr. Zalmezak and represents through\ncounsel that the City remains committed to accomplishing the transfer of Parcel 11\nfrom CPS, and to begin discussions with CPS to do so “in the near future.” R. 208, Exh.\n1, Zalmezak Declaration ¶ 9. And, the City points out, the proposed Arts School would\nhave been a temporary occupancy only, and would not have prevented residential\nredevelopment planning for the site during the occupancy. Based on the progress made,\nthe  obstacles  to  redevelopment,  and  the  City’s  commitment  to  start  transfer\ndiscussions with CPS in the near future, the Court finds that there is no violation of\nthe Consent Decree.\nAt least not yet. There might come a time soon when the City’s failure to take\neven the preliminary step of obtaining control of the site from CPS will result in a\nbreach of the Consent Decree. Redevelopment on Parcel 11, one of the area’s largest\nsites, is necessary if the City is going to meet the promised number of public housing\nunits and affordable units. When the Consent Decree was entered, the City believed\nthat Parcel 11 must be redeveloped in order to meet the promise; the City believed it\nin 2009 when the Arts School proposed to occupy the site temporarily; and the City\nbelieves it now (barring some unforeseen change in the area), as reaffirmed by the\nCity’s counsel during the in-court hearing. Given Parcel 11’s necessity, either losing\ncontrol over the site or developing substantially fewer units on the site than originally\nestimated  could prove fatal to satisfying the Consent Decree. The site must be\nredeveloped, and the first step is to ensure its availability to the City. The City fears\nthat taking title to the property too far in advance of actual redevelopment will burden\n8\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:436\nthe City with the costs of maintaining a vacant lot and securing a vacant building (the\nclosed high school). That is a legitimate concern, but at some point the maintenance\ncosts (which are borne by City taxpayers in any event, whether Parcel 11 is in CPS’s\nor in the City’s hands) will be outweighed by the lack of progress in ensuring Parcel\n11’s availability for redevelopment under the Consent Decree. In other words, the City \nmust hold fast both to its short-term commitment to begin transfer discussions with\nCPS “in the near future,” as well as to its longer-term commitment to redevelop the site\nconsistent with the Consent Decree. \nIII.\nA final point is worth noting. There does appear to have been a break-down in\ncommunication between the City and the Working Group in 2009. The minutes of the\nFebruary 2009 Working Group meeting demonstrate that LAC was clearly surprised\nby what sounded like advanced-stage negotiations between CPS and the Arts School\nto a Parcel 11 lease as long as possibly four years. Although the City’s representatives\nappeared to have insisted to CPS that the Consent Decree required the eventual\nresidential redevelopment of the site, it would have better served the Working Group’s\nfunction of providing overall development direction to have earlier informed the\nWorking Group of the Arts School proposal. To be sure, not every idea or discussion\nwith every proposed developer or occupant need be shared with the Working Group,\nparticularly where there might be business reasons to maintain confidentiality early\non in the discussions. But, where feasible, it is better to err on the side of including the\nWorking Group as early as possible to avoid miscommunication and to preserve the\n9\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 222 Filed: 08/15/11 Page 10 of 10 PageID #:437\nWorking  Group’s  decree-dictated  place  as  monitor  and  reviewer  of  development\nactivities.\nFor the reasons discussed above, the motion to compel [R. 203] is denied without\nprejudice.2\nENTERED:\n___________________________\nEDMOND E.

R. 254 \nat 6–7. Worse, not only was $25,106 used in petty cash with no recorded purpose, \nmoney was affirmative misspent, such as payments to the father of the sons of the \nCDC’s then-President, Carole Steele, id. at 6, and to cover funeral expenses of Steele’s \nbrother, id. at 7.  \n \nEven after the Court entered an interim-relief order requiring strict record-\nkeeping and disclosures of expenditures, the record evidence shows that still Carole \nSteele signed a $7,200 check to her son, Travaughn Steele, as purported “severance \npay” on around July 20, 2021. R. 376, Exh. E. Not surprisingly, in a demonstration of \nconsciousness of guilt, Steele did not disclose the expenditure as required under the \ninterim-relief order. R. 376 at 6.  \n \nOn top of that, Steele and then-Board members JoAnn Hollie, Lynell Dillon, \nLena Wells, and Vincent Davis also paid themselves, on around July 20, 2021, each \na purported “stipend” of $2,000. R. 376, Exh. E. These payments too were not disclose \nas required by the interim-relief order. R. 376 at 6. The payment of the purported \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 413 Filed: 03/31/22 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:1702\nstipends were in direct violation of an express ban in the CDC Articles of Incorpora-\ntion & By-Laws. R. 244-1, By-Laws § 10 (“Directors of the Corporation shall not re-\nceive salaries or compensation for serving as directors ….”).  \n \nAfter discovery of the payments, the then-Directors and Travaughn Steele \nagreed to pay back the funds. But further relief is warranted in light of the explicit \nviolation of the interim-relief order and, more importantly, the By-Laws’ ban on re-\nceiving compensation as a director. The record evidence supports a finding that Carol \nSteele, JoAnn Hollie, Lynell Dillon, Lena Wells, and Vincent Davis knew that the By-\nLaws banned the stipends (the By-Laws have contained that ban since August 24, \n2009, R. 244-1, By-Laws title page). The knowing violation of the By-Laws for per-\nsonal gain warrants a ban on any future role of theirs in an officer or director position \nof CDC (or any successor corporation under the Consent Decree).  \n \nSpecifically, it is ordered that Carol Steele, JoAnn Hollie, Lynell Dillon, Lena \nWells, and Vincent Davis are prohibited from occupying any corporate officer or di-\nrector role in CDC or any other LAC operating entity that takes its place pursuant to \nthe Consent Decree, R. 160, and are also prohibited from being involved in any \nCabrini-Green Local Advisory Council’s (LAC’s) operating entity’s responsibilities as \nset out in Section III.A.1 of the Consent Decree.  \n \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n                ENTERED:   \n \n \n                  s/Edmond E.

On August 30, 2000, a Consent Decree was entered in this matter between the \nLAC and Defendants. Doc. #160. The Consent Decree provides that “(a) the \nLAC (or its affiliated development entity) be a partner, or other form of owner, \nwith up to 50% interest in the ownership of the partnership (or other entity) \nchosen to be the developer of housing thereunder, and (b) that the LAC (or its \naffiliated entity) participate in (i) the receipt of developers’ fees and profits \n(provided the LAC uses such fees and profits for not-for-profit purposes to ben-\nefit current and displaced Cabrini residents) . . ., (ii) the selection of property \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:1224\nmanagers and construction contractor, (iii) the planning of the development, \nand (iv) the development of resident and other programs.”  \nB. On January 8, 2003, Cabrini Green New Beginnings NFP was created as a \nnon-profit corporation registered with the State of Illinois and approved by the \nIRS on December 16, 2004 as a tax-exempt organization. Cabrini Green New \nBeginnings NFP was renamed as Cabrini-Green Local Advisory Council Com-\nmunity Development Corporation (“CDC”) on March 25, 2005. The CDC serves \nas the affiliated development entity created by the LAC under the Consent \nDecree. \nC. The Court has jurisdiction over the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”), the \nCity of Chicago (“City”), the LAC and any other affiliated development entity \ncreated under the Consent Decree, including the CDC. \nD. On May 21, 2020, the Chicago Housing Authority Office of Inspector General \nissued an investigatory report containing findings that, among other things, \nthe CDC and certain Board members misappropriated and mismanaged funds \nthat were generated pursuant to the Consent Decree.  Doc. #230-2 and #230-3. \nE. On July 22, 2020, Defendants filed their Motion to Enforce and Modify Consent \nDecree. Doc. #230.  \nF.  The CDC is a legal entity that was created by the LAC pursuant to the author-\nity conferred by the Consent Decree. The CDC has its own board, separate and \napart from the LAC.  The LAC, however, pursuant to the CDC’s bylaws, has \nthe power to appoint and remove members of the CDC board.  \n  2 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:1225\nG. On March 16, 2021, the LAC board approved a Motion To Approve Proposal \nTo Settle CHA/City Motion To Enforce In The Cabrini-Green Consent Decree \nCase, the terms of which settlement are memorialized in this Agreed Order. \nNOW THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \n1.  A Temporary Custodian shall be appointed by the Court until such time that \ntheir duties are discharged as set forth below. \na.  Process for selection of the Temporary Custodian: the LAC shall propose \nthree persons and CHA/City shall propose three persons to serve as \nTemporary Custodian. The parties will consult and make best efforts to \nmutually agree upon a Temporary Custodian. In the event the parties \ncannot agree, the LAC will get two strikes and CHA/City will get two \nstrikes, and then submit the remaining two names to Judge McShain \nfor a final selection. \ni.  Qualifications of the Temporary Custodian: The Temporary Cus-\ntodian shall be a person who is not a current CHA or City em-\nployee, has not presided over judicial proceedings in the underly-\ning suit, is not a Board Member of the LAC or CDC, is not a rela-\ntive of an LAC or CDC Board member, has not previously served \nas a consultant to the LAC or CDC, and shall have knowledge of \nand/or experience in one or more of the following areas: \n1.   Nonprofit operations \n2.   Nonprofit governance \n  3 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:1226\n3.

Federal judgeship \nb.  Immediately upon appointment of the Temporary Custodian, the term \nof the current board members of the CDC will terminate and the LAC \nwill propose the appointment of three caretaker board members to be \nselected from the remaining members of the LAC. Relatives of current \nCDC and LAC board members are not eligible. CHA and the City may \nraise objections to any of the proposed caretaker board members, with \nthe  understanding  that  the  final  decision  would  rest  with  Judge \nMcShain. \ni.  Throughout this agreement, “relative” means a person who is re-\nlated to a current or former LAC or CDC Board member as spouse \nor as any of the following, whether by blood or by adoption: par-\nent, child, brother or sister, aunt or uncle, great aunt or great un-\ncle, first cousin, niece or nephew, grandparent, grandchild, fa-\nther-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sister-\nin-law, brother-in-law, stepfather or stepmother, stepson or step-\ndaughter, stepbrother or stepsister, half-brother or half-sister, \n  4 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:1227\nand  includes  the  grandfather  or  grandmother  of  the  person’s \nspouse and the person’s fiancé or fiancée, or a person with whom \na current or former LAC or CDC Board member has had/shares a \nchild. \nc.   The Temporary Custodian will collaborate with and make best efforts \nto reach consensus with the caretaker CDC board in accomplishing the \nfollowing tasks: \ni.   Select nine CDC board members. \n1.   Create board position descriptions; advertise the positions; \ninterview the candidates; and field input provided by LAC, \nCHA, and the City. \n2.   With respect to the constituency of the CDC board: \na.  The original five CDC board members and their rel-\natives (as defined above) would not be eligible to ap-\nply; \nb.  Six of the nine slots would be filled by current or for-\nmer Cabrini residents or Housing Choice Voucher \nparticipants who were former Cabrini residents as \nprovided under the CDC bylaws. \nc.  Three of the nine slots would be filled by individuals \nwith experience in social services, finance/ account-\ning, and/or advertising/marketing. \n  5 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:1228\n3.  In the event the Temporary Custodian and caretaker CDC \nboard are unable to agree upon one or more of the nine \nboard member positions or if CHA or the City raises objec-\ntions to any board member, Judge McShain would make \nthe final selection decision. \n4.  The LAC, consistent with its vested powers, would then ap-\npoint the new CDC board members identified pursuant to \nthe process described above. \nd.  The Temporary Custodian will collaborate with and make best efforts to \nreach consensus with the new CDC Board in accomplishing the follow-\ning tasks: \ni.   Select a professional staff, including Executive Director and Ac-\ncountant. \n1.  In accordance with the Order entered August 22, 2020, \nwhen the Temporary Custodian and the new CDC Board \nare ready to retain professional services, they must confer \nwith the LAC, CHA, and the City before entering into a \nbinding contract. The conferral shall include disclosure of \nthe proposed contract. The CHA and the City shall provide \na response within three business days of the conferral and \nshall not withhold reasonable consent. \n  6 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:1229\n2.  In the event the Temporary Custodian and the new CDC \nboard are unable to agree upon a person to fill either posi-\ntion, or if the CHA or the City objects, Judge McShain \nwould make the final selection decision. \ne.  Once the CDC professional staff is hired and training of the new CDC \nboard members (on responsible non-profit management) has been com-\npleted, the new CDC board members have certified that they will comply \nwith the goals of the Consent Decree, and upon the Temporary Custo-\ndian’s submission of a final report on the duties performed in accordance \nwith this agreement to the Court and the parties, the Court shall dis-\ncharge the Temporary Custodian. The Court shall then appoint the \nTemporary Custodian to serve as Monitor to observe and regularly re-\nport to the Court and the parties for a period of six months, unless oth-\nerwise extended by the Court. The Monitor will remain in place until \ndischarged by order of the Court. \ni.   The Monitor will report monthly to the Court and to the parties. \n1.  The Monitor will provide monthly financial reports to the \nparties. \n2.  The Monitor will provide status reports to the Court and to \nthe parties every two months. \nii.  Prior to any discharge of the Monitor, the Monitor will provide a \nfinal report to the Court and the parties on the duties performed \n  7 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:1230\nin accordance with this agreement and the progress of the new \nCDC Board. LAC, CHA, and City may submit position statements \nto the Court as to the need to extend the Monitor. \nf.  While the Temporary Custodian is in place, the operation of the CDC in \npursuit of its charitable mission would be conducted by (I) the caretaker \nCDC board (followed by the new CDC board) together with (II) the Tem-\nporary Custodian. Any disagreements regarding operations that cannot \nbe resolved by the Temporary Custodian and CDC board would be sub-\nmitted to Judge McShain for decision. \ng.  Throughout the process of selecting the new CDC board and hiring a \nprofessional staff, the CDC’s obligations for its regular reporting to the \nparties and to the Court stand, pursuant to this Court’s August 22, 2020 \norder (issued on CHA/City’s Motion to Freeze). After discharge of the \nTemporary Custodian and appointment of the Monitor, the CDC shall \ninstead report to the Monitor, as determined by the Court. The Monitor \nwill provide all reporting to the LAC, CHA and the City as provided in \nparagraph I.e. above. \nh.  Upon termination of the Monitor, the CDC Board will provide annual \naudit reports to the parties within 30 days of completion of the audit. \ni.  A mutual non-disparagement provision will be prepared and approved \nby the parties, including a mutual review of public statements regarding \nthis agreement prior to release. \n  8 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 335 Filed: 04/21/21 Page 9 of 9 PageID #:1231\nj.

COAR\nCHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY, et al., )\n)\nDefendants. )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nNow before this court is a motion to compel enforcement of this Court’s consent decree\nof August 30, 2000 (“the decree”), filed by Plaintiffs Cabrini-Green Local Advisory Council and\nDorothy Gautreaux (“Plaintiffs” or “LAC”) against the Chicago Housing Authority\n(“Defendant” or “CHA”) with respect to a lease provision being used in the Old Town Parkside\nmixed-income community (“Parkside”) under development at Cabrini-Green.  Plaintiff claims\nthat it contains language requiring eviction of felony convicts residing in the complex, in a\nmanner that violates the Decree.  For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED. \n-1-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:247\nBACKGROUND1\nThe parties have been in dispute over the development of Cabrini-Green for over ten\nyears.  As a result of prior legal battles, the parties are now moving forward under the standing\nconsent decree issued by this Court, which established guidelines by which CHA can continue to\ndevelop the land in question and LAC can be involved in that process and provide oversight. \nAccording to that arrangement, this Court has been responsible for facilitating negotiations\nbetween the two parties, conducting arbitration where necessary, and ensuring compliance with\nthe decree’s terms.  Since this approach was undertaken in 2000, the projects at Cabrini-Green\nhave moved forward, with development taking place, guarantees made for limitations on resident\ndisplacement and lower-income housing, and general cooperation from both parties.\nLAC now moves this Court to compel enforcement of the decree, namely, Section II.A of\nits terms, which requires that public units be maintained and operated in accordance with all\napplicable requirements applicable to public housing agencies (“PHAs”).  LAC is troubled by a\nprovision included in Park side leases that would allegedly require eviction whenever a resident\nwas found to have been convicted of a felony.  The contentious language is found in the lease\nrider (“rider”) at para. 13(c)(9), and states: “For termination of the LEASE, the following\nprocedures shall be followed by LESSOR and the TENANT: ...The LEASE may be\nterminated...[when] [t]he TENANT or any authorized family member is convicted of a felony.”\nThis language was added to the document on August 24, 2006, subsequent to public comment\nand final CHA Board approval on June 20, 2006, but prior to the closing date of October 9, 2006\n1For a summary of the history of these disputes, see Cabrini-Green Local Advisory\nCouncil v. Chicago Housing Authority, 1997 WL 31002, at *1-*4 (N.D. Ill., Jan. 22, 1997). \nSince that time, however, the development has moved forward significantly.\n-2-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:248\nfor the construction of Parkside Phase 1.  2nd Mot. at 2.  Plaintiff alleges that this clause violates\nthe Federal limitation on public housing projects, requiring that leases “not contain unreasonable\nterms and conditions,”  42 U.S.C.A. § 1437d(l)(2), and is contrary to federal law and public\npolicy.\nLEGAL BACKGROUND\nThis Court has retained jurisdiction over this matter only as far as necessary to enforce\nthe terms of the decree.  A consent decree “is an agreement that the parties desire and expect will\nbe reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally\napplicable to other judgments and decrees.”  Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S.\n367, 378 (1992) (emphasis added).  “From the standpoint of interpretation, a consent decree is a\ncontract.”  Cook v. City of Chicago, 192 F.3d 693, 695 (7th Cir.1999). \nANALYSIS\nThis motion to enforce is brought on the limited grounds that Defendant CHA, by\nincluding the contested language in its leases, has failed to operate the public housing units “in\naccordance with all applicable public housing requirements.”  2nd Mot. ¶ 2 (citing Decree §\nII.A).  Though the parties have only addressed the Public Housing Act of 1937 and its\namendment under the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (“QHWRA”), public\nhousing agencies are also guided by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment directives found in 24 C.F.R. 966.\nAs an initial matter, it should be noted that public housing leases are already required to\nenable property managers to terminate leases based on perceived threats to community safety. \nThe requirement is found in 42 U.S.C. Section 1437d(1)(6), which provides that “[e]ach public\n-3-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:249\nhousing agency shall utilize leases which...provide that any criminal activity that threatens the\nhealth, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants or any drug-related\ncriminal activity on or off such premises, engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member of\nthe tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be cause for\ntermination of tenancy.”  However, in the instant case this demand has been met by other clauses\nin the lease that Plaintiff has not contested.  See 13(c)(5-6, 12).  The contested language found in\n13(c)(9), however, would expand termination authority beyond the “drug-related criminal\nactivity” and threats to the “health, safety or right of peaceful of the premises” included in these\nrequired terms.  \nThe parties have misstated the requirements under the law and the demands of the rider\nCHA has advanced.  Plaintiff maintains that the language in question “violates federal law\ngoverning public housing leases,” 2nd Mot. ¶ 5, because it “requires eviction for a resident\nconvicted of any felony,” id. at 1; see also 2nd Mot. Mem. at 2 (referring to the clause as a\n“[b]lanket eviction for tenants who are convicted of felonies”).  While such a clause might in fact\nviolate federal law, as Plaintiff states elsewhere the current language only “allows the owner to\nevict a public housing resident who has been convicted of any felony.”  Id. ¶ 4 (emphasis added). \nSimilarly, Defendant overstates the relevant law, claiming that the contested lease provision “is\nrequired by federal law.”  Opp. Br. at 2.  This is not supported by any proffered citation.  The\nonly question is whether CHA may choose to give Lakeside managers the discretion to evict for\nany felony – in addition to their unquestioned “one-strike” eviction powers – or whether that\nchoice is contrary to 42 U.S.C. Section 1437d(l)(2)’s prohibition against “unreasonable terms\nand conditions” or other federal law.  \n-4-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:250\nPlaintiff claims that the clause is overly broad and not related to a legitimate purpose. \nLAC bolsters this argument with extensive analysis of Richmond Tenants Org., Inc. v. Richmond\nRedevelopment and Hous. Auth., which requires that “lease terms must be rationally related to a\nlegitimate housing purpose.”  751 F. Supp. 1204, 1205-06 (E.D. Va. 1990).  According to\nPlaintiff, moving beyond the one-strike bases for lease termination grants a degree of discretion\nthat cannot be justified under that standard – the required clauses already accomplish any\nlegitimate housing purpose, and the additional, broader language only serves to grant an\ninappropriate degree of discretion to the property manager.  The Richmond case is not directly on\npoint and is not binding authority.  However, this Court may still give weight to its reasoning ,\nparticularly where application to the instant case would not unreasonably burden the developer\nand would avoid unnecessarily broad lease terms.  While there is no denying that safety is one of\nHUD’s primary concerns and that felony convictions might be an effective indicator of housing\ncommunity dangers, the Richmond standard would at least narrow discretion to avoid some of\nthose situations where termination would be untenable.  How could a felony conviction for a\nnon-threatening action possibly necessitate lease termination?  Why should it be necessary to\nallow discretionary authority over any instance of a felony, when this clause could very easily be\nrewritten to include only those drug and violent crimes that might actually pose a threat to the\ncommunity?  \nUnder the Richmond standard, Defendant has completely failed to demonstrate how\nproviding a landlord with the discretion to terminate leases based on such crimes could be\n“rationally related to a legitimate housing purpose.”  751 F. Supp. at 1205-06.  CHA claims that\n“striking the provision now – before it has been implemented – needlessly and prematurely\n-5-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:251\nremoves an important tool from the property manager’s management portfolio.”  Opp. Br. at 11. \nHowever, Plaintiff is not arguing that managers should not have the tools and the discretion to\nevict some criminals from the property, but only that their power should not be unfettered. \nDefendant has failed to identify a single instance of a felony for which 13(c)(9) would allow a\nlease termination not already provided for by other rider terms, but still “rationally related to a\nlegitimate housing purpose.”  As Plaintiff points out, seemingly non-threatening violations of the\nlaw such as wireless service theft presently fall under 13(c)(9), and it would not be burdensome\nto redraft the document so that manager discretion would not incorporate every felony in the\nstate of Illinois.\nWhile the above analysis might suggest that the language of 13(c)(9) is unnecessary,\nhowever, it is nonetheless necessary to verify that the Richmond standard is an appropriate\ninterpretation of PHA regulations.  There is little in the statutory language or legislative history\nto suggest that the Virginia court was incorrect.  Plaintiff generally maintains that the language is\nprohibited along with all “unreasonable terms and conditions” that are contrary to the explicit\nlanguage of 1437d(l)(2), but the lack of a clear definition of this term demands that we look\nfurther to determine the meaning of this requirement.  Defendant argues that any felony can\nreasonably form the basis for termination, and seeks support in QHWRA language extending\nminimum notice protections and the potential for expedited proceedings to lease terminations\nresulting from “any drug-related or violent criminal activity or any felony conviction.”  See 42\nU.S.C. §§1437d(l)(4); d(k) (emphasis added).  However, the fact that these requirements are to\nbe applied to “any felony conviction” or even “any activity resulting in a felony conviction” does\nnot mean that lease terminations themselves can be so broadly based.   Instead, the language\n-6-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:252\ncited by Defendant means only that where a “felony conviction” forms the basis of an allowable\ntermination under QHWRA – i.e., does not involve “unreasonable terms and conditions” – it will\nbe governed by this additional language.  Congress may in fact have had in mind such a broad\ngrant of authority for terminations based on felonies, but that is not explicit in the language of\nQHWRA and therefore does not itself establish the reasonableness of 13(c)(9).\nPlaintiff further argues that QHWRA and its legislative history indicate that lawmakers\ndid not want manager discretion to be as expansive as the language drafted by CHA.  In support\nPlaintiff notes that an earlier version of QHWRA required public housing leases to include\ngrounds for termination based on any “criminal activity on or off the premises,” and Plaintiff\nmaintains that the absence of this language from the codified law indicates a reluctance to\nprovide managers with overly-expansive discretion.  However, this language does not greatly\nassist Plaintiff because the instant language is already narrower than that which the legislature\nrejected, limiting discretion to any “felony” rather than the significantly broader “criminal\nactivity.”  In that sense, the current language is not incompatible with Plaintiff’s subsequent\nstatement that “a lease provision that grants a PHA carte blanche to evict tenants for any criminal\nactivity is unreasonable”  – that is simply not the sort of term being considered here.  \nThe United States Housing Act of 1937 and subsequent amendments under QHWRA\nprovide de minimis lease language, but do not generally prevent housing authorities from using\nmore expansive terms.  Indeed, the amendments of 1997 were seemingly intended to increase\npublic housing agency discretion: “the federal method of overseeing every aspect of public\nhousing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations has aggravated the problem and has\nplaced excessive administrative burdens on public housing agencies; and the interests of low-\n-7-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:253\nincome persons, and the public interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing\nprogram that...vests in public housing agencies that perform well the maximum feasible\nauthority, direction and control with appropriate accountability to public housing residents,\nlocalities, and the general public.”  See House Conf. Report 105-769, 1998 U.S.C.C.A.N. 539, p.\n63.  This language indeed points toward a general legislative intent to provide PHAs with greater\nfreedom in making tenant decisions.\nNonetheless, the most clear limitation on PHAs contained in the public housing laws is\nthat lease provisions not contain “unreasonable terms and conditions.”  Whatever else\n“unreasonable” may mean, it would appear that granting managers the power to terminate leases\nfor felonies irrelevant to any legitimate housing purposes would fall within its scope.  Support\nfor this view can be found in HUD Regulations, under which PHA leases must obligate tenants\nto “abide by necessary and reasonable regulations promulgated by the PHA...which shall be\nposted in the project office and incorporated by reference in the lease.”  24 C.F.R. § 966.4(f)(4);\nsee Lancor v. Lebanon Hous. Auth., 760 F.2d 361 (2nd Cir. 1985) (applying the “necessary and\nreasonable” language to a PHA lease term requiring written approval for overnight guests). \nAgain, this requirement is above and beyond criminal activities related to drugs or threatening to\nthe “health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises” that are covered in another\nsubsection.  See 24 C.F.R. § 966.4(f)(12).  These regulations closely parallel the lease\nrequirements under 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(2), and therefore provide this Court with support for\nadopting some idea of necessity into its determination of what terms are reasonable.2  In light of\n2It is worth noting that, like 42 U.S.C. § 1437, the HUD Regulations once again fail to\nmention any generalized grant of authority for PHAs to terminate tenancy for felony convictions,\nbut do allow for termination based on flight from a felony conviction.  See 24 C.F.R. § 966.4\n-8-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:254\nthis, Richmond’s “rationally related” standard appears to be an entirely appropriate, less-\nstringent standard.  \nDefendant maintains that its clause is in line with this legislative intent and allows for a\nmore flexible process.  The lease terms do not make lease terminations for felonies mandatory,\nbut rather give the manager of Lakeside discretion to execute them in those cases.  In addition,\nDefendant maintains that the discretion would not be completely unfettered, as par. 6D of the\nDecree’s “Term Sheet” ensures Plaintiff’s involvement in the hiring of the manager making\neviction decisions, as well as its inclusion in reviewing adverse actions against residents.  Resp.\n2nd Mot. at 2.  Despite these limited safeguards, Defendant has nonetheless failed to\ndemonstrate that this grant of discretion is appropriate under PHA standards.  While this Court\nagrees with Defendant that the QHWRA amendments had the purpose of “promot[ing] homes\nthat are affordable to low income families in safe and healthy environments,” see Opp. Br. at 7\n(quoting Conf. Rep. 105-769, p. 63), we nonetheless disagree that 13(c)(9) is rationally related to\nthis legitimate purpose. \nIt should also be noted that Plaintiff makes an effective argument that unnecessarily\nevicting felons from the Parkside complex is contrary to public policy.  With respect to those\nwho have been released from our penal system, it provides no societal benefit to deny them a\nplace to live where their presence does not create a identifiable threat against surrounding\nresidents.  It could be also said that the parties have up until now cooperated according to an\nimplied promise of good faith dealing that seems to have been undermined by the insertion of\nSection 13(c)(9).  While this court will not read into the decree’s clear terms a general duty to\n(l)(5)(ii)(B)\n-9-\n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 198 Filed: 01/29/07 Page 10 of 10 PageID #:255\nnegotiate in good faith,3 there is nonetheless no reason to think that the negotiating process that\nhas proven so effective in the past should not here be able to resolve this situation.  \nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiff alleges a violation of the decree predicated on the fact that 13(c)(9) violates\npublic housing law.  This Court agrees.  The language is in no way required by the 1937 Act or\nits amendments, and Defendant has not advanced a compelling argument that the unnecessarily\nbroad language is reasonable under PHA standards.  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’\nmotion for enforcement of the consent decree is GRANTED, and the language of clause 13(c)(9)\nis rendered unenforceable as written in all current and future leases and lease riders related to\nthis matter.\nEnter:\n/s/ David H.

A private right of action is consistent with the \nMarch 13, 1995 agreements and that those agreements are \nunderlying purpose of the statute; and \nenforceable. (See Compl., ¶¶ 38, 43 (stating that “CHA \nand plaintiff entered into a Memorandum of Agreement” \n4. A private right of action is necessary to effectuate \nand  that  “CHA,  through  its  Chairman,  Vincent  Lane, \nthe purposes of the act. \nagreed  in  writing  with  the  plaintiff”)).  Second,  the \npleadings in this case do not establish that the agreements \nSee id. \nwere  impossible  to  perform  because  of  conditions \n  \nprecedent that did not occur. Finally, the court finds that \nFirst of all, the court notes that no Illinois court has found \nthe  terms  of  the  March  13,  1995  agreement  are  not \nan implied private right of action under the Act. While \nunascertainable.

In regard to the third factor, the \n \ncourt finds that the Illinois Housing Authorities Act was \n \nnot enacted in order to regulate housing authorities, but to \ncreate them and to vest them with powers to address \nhousing problems. The court finds that a private right of \nH. Promissory Estoppel Claim \naction would be inconsistent with this underlying purpose. \nIn Count 22, plaintiff alleges that some families moved \nIn addition, the general mandate of the Illinois Housing \nout  of  1158  N.  Cleveland  in  detrimental  reliance  on \nAuthorities Act does not provide the court with enough \nCHA’s promise to rehabilitate that building. (Compl., ¶ \nguidance  as  to  how  the  Act’s  provisions  should  be \n101).  Defendants  argue  that  this  promissory  estoppel \nenforced. For similar reasons, the court finds that the \nclaim must be dismissed because it fails to establish an \nfourth element of the Sawyer test is not satisfied. The \nunambiguous promise to families that they could return to \nIllinois General Assembly, by enacting the Act, has taken \n1158 N. Cleveland after if was rehabilitated. The court \non the responsibility of monitoring housing authorities in \nfinds, however, that plaintiff’s has adequately pled such a \nthe execution of their general powers; thus, a private right \npromise. Plaintiff relies on the fact that the original HOPE \nof action is not necessary to effectuate the purposes of the \nVI application provided for the rehabilitation of 1158 N. \nact. Count 15 of plaintiff’s complaint is dismissed. \nCleveland. Furthermore, plaintiff’s allege that the March \n  \n15, 1995 agreement between LAC and CHA called for \n \nsuch  rehabilitation.  Moreover,  at  this  stage  of  the \n \nproceedings, the court cannot say that CHA’s promise \nwas not directed to the individual tenant families. For \nthese reasons, the court finds that plaintiff has properly \nG. Contract Claims \nstated a promissory estoppel claim. \n*19 CHA also moves to dismiss Counts 16-21. CHA \n  \nargues that LAC is not a party to the March 13, 1995 \n \nagreement that is the basis of Counts 16, 17, 19, and 20 \nand  therefore  has  no  right  to  enforce  the  document. \nFurthermore, CHA contends that LAC has failed to allege \n14 \n \n\n \n \nCabrini-Green Local Advisory Council v. Chicago Housing..., Not Reported in...   \n \n \nIV. Conclusion  ENTER. \n  \nWHEREFORE,  for  the  foregoing  reasons,  defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint is granted in part  All Citations \nand denied in part. Counts 9, 10, 12, and 15 of plaintiff’s \ncomplaint are dismissed with prejudice.  Not Reported in F.Supp., 1997 WL 31002 \n    \nFootnotes \n \n1  The City’s Consolidated Plan provides that the City will: \n \n(1) Serve the Full Range of Constituencies among Low- and Moderate-income Populations \nCoordinate affordable housing activities with new CHA initiatives to improve public housing and the quality of \nlife for low-income public housing residents by creating stable communities that not only provide decent \nshelter but also social and economic opportunities for residents.... \n(2) Promote Community Revitalization and Stability through a Range of Development Activities. \nPlace primary emphasis on the preservation of affordable housing units and rehabilitation of existing housing \nstock.... \n(3) Provide for Special Needs Populations. \nIncrease the supply and availability of resources to address the needs of Chicago’s homeless population.... \n(Compl., ¶ 53). \n \n2  Plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on November 8, 1996, asking the court to enjoin: (1) the \n  demolition of 1158 N. Cleveland, including an order upon CHA to withdraw the demolition application that CHA \nrecently submitted to HUD; (2) the demolition of 1150-60 N. Sedgwick prior to the construction of replacement \nhousing; and (3) the unlawful relocation of the residents from 1150-60 N. Sedgwick. On December 19, 1996, the \ncourt held a hearing on that motion. The only issue considered by the court at that time was the request to enjoin \nthe relocation of the residents from 1150-60 N. Sedgwick. On December 20, 1996, the court declined to issue an \ninjunction prohibiting that relocation. \n \n3  In addition to its allegations that it has suffered organizational injury, LAC has alleged harm to its members. (See \n  Compl., ¶¶ 74-75). Hunt suggested that individual participation of an organization’s members is not normally \nnecessary (and thus the third prong of the Hunt test would be satisfied) when an association seeks only prospective \nor injunctive relief, as opposed to monetary damages. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S. Ct. at 2441;see also United \nSteelworkers of Am. v. University of Alabama, 599 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir. 1979) (holding that union had standing to \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief for benefit of itself and its individual members); cf. Warth, 422 U.S. at 515, 95 \nS. Ct. at 2213 (“If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other form of prospective \nrelief, it can reasonably be supposed that the remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the \nassociation actually injured.”). In this case, plaintiff is merely seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, suggesting \n15 \n \n\n \n \nCabrini-Green Local Advisory Council v. Chicago Housing..., Not Reported in...   \n \n \nthat participation in the case by LAC members is not required. \n \n4  The court reiterates that it may only dismiss this suit based on lack of standing if it is clear that no relief could be \n  granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations. Hishon, 467 U.S. at 73, 104 S. Ct. \nat 2232. The court’s decision, therefore, is based on reasonable inferences that the plaintiff must prove at trial. The \nstanding inquiry can be revisited at trial if it appears that facts necessary for standing are not supported by the \nevidence adduced at trial. See Jackson, 21 F.3d at 1536 n.5 (citing Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 \nU.S. 91, 116 n.31, 99 S. Ct. 1601, 1616 n.31 (1979)). \n \n5  Section 3604(a) of the FHA states that it is unlawful \n \nto refuse to sell or rent ... or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or \ndeny a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin. \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). \n \n6  CHA also argues that its interest in adopting the CHA Plan is to improve Cabrini-Green housing and open it to a wider \n  range of residents, therefore suggesting that LAC has failed to state a claim for relief under the FHA. (See, e.g., Def. \nReply, at 11-12). However, as stated previously, an argument based on one of the Arlington Heights factors is more \nproperly considered at summary judgment or at trial. At this stage of the proceedings, such an argument cannot \ndefeat the allegations in a well-pleaded complaint that properly state a claim for relief under the FHA. \nFurthermore, the court rejects CHA’s argument that allowing plaintiff to go forward with its FHA claims based in \npart on its allegations of discriminatory effect will necessarily mean “any housing strategy CHA proposes [for \nCabrini-Green] will violate the FHA.” (Def. Reply, at 11). This is not the case. At this stage of the proceedings, the \nissue is simply whether plaintiff has properly stated a claim. Plaintiff still has the burden to prove the alleged \nviolations of the FHA. \n \n7  Title VI provides that: \n \nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance. \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d. \n \n8  CHA has also argued that Count 6 should be dismissed because the CHA Plan is not required to comply with 42 \n  U.S.C. § 1437v(d)(2), as alleged by plaintiff. The court declines to decide whether a “revitalization” requirement \nexists in § 1437v(d)(2), because it finds that Count 6 states a claim based solely on a violation of HOPE VI. \n \n16 \n \n\n \n \nCabrini-Green Local Advisory Council v. Chicago Housing..., Not Reported in...   \n \n \n9  CHA contends that there is no requirement that plans for disbursement of HOPE VI funds comply with the tenant \n  consultation provisions found in 42 U.S.C. § 1437p. The court rejects this argument. HOPE VI cannot be read in a \nvacuum. Section 1437p specifically deals with the demolition of public housing. It is clear to the court that if HOPE VI \nfunds are to be used to demolish public housing, then the plan submitted pursuant to HOPE VI must also comply \nwith the tenant consultation provisions of § 1437p. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n17 \n ",

The \nLocal Advisory Council (which goes by its acronym, LAC) had alleged that the CHA’s \nplan would displace the then-current residents and would reduce the affordable \nhousing stock in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604, as well as other \ncivil-rights laws.  \nUnder the Consent Decree, the CHA agreed (among other things) to require \nthat private developers give the LAC both an ownership interest in and a share of \nfees and profits from certain new development projects in Cabrini-Green. Consent \n \n1Citations to the record are noted as “R.” followed by the docket number, and when \nnecessary, the page or paragraph number. \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 2 of 11 PageID #:891\nDecree § III.A.1. The receipt of developer fees and profits, however, was conditioned \non the LAC only using the money “for non-profit purposes to benefit current and \ndisplaced Cabrini-Green residents.” Id. To hold the ownership interest and to receive \ndeveloper fees, the Consent Decree expressly contemplated that the LAC would have \nan “affiliated development entity.” Id. So, in 2003, the LAC created a non-profit \norganization  called  the  Cabrini-Green  Local  Advisory  Council  Community \nDevelopment Corporation (known as the CDC), whose stated purpose was to “provide \nrelief” to Cabrini-Green residents. R. 230-1, Lischka Decl. ¶ 6; R. 244-1, Pl. Resp. Br., \nExh. A, CDC Bylaws at 1. The CDC’s Board of Directors is comprised of current or \ndisplaced Cabrini-Green residents and is entirely appointed by the LAC. Lischka \nDecl. ¶ 7.  \nMore than a decade passed without apparent incident. But in December 2016, \nthe CHA’s Office of Inspector General began receiving complaints that Carol Steele, \nwho is the President of both the LAC and the CDC, had misappropriated CDC funds \nfor her personal use. Lischka Decl. ¶ 2. Over the next 3½ years, the OIG undertook \nan investigation of the CDC’s finances, which culminated in a report published in \nMay 2020. Id. ¶ 3; R. 230-2, Lischka Decl., Exh. 1-A, OIG Report. In short, the OIG \nReport appeared to confirm the allegations of financial mismanagement against \nSteele and the CDC. (A fuller account of the findings will appear below.)  \nGiven the mishandling of funds set forth in the OIG Report, the CHA and City \nnow seek, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, to preliminarily freeze the bank \naccounts of the CDC as well as certain members of the LAC and CDC, including Carol \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 3 of 11 PageID #:892\nSteele, Lynnell Dillon, and JoAnn Hollie. R. 242. (Defendants have also filed a \nbroader motion to enforce and modify the Consent Decree, R. 130, but that will be \nconsidered  separately  in  a  later  order,  pending  the  outcome  of  settlement \ndiscussions.) The LAC opposes the motion to freeze. R. 244, LAC Resp. Br. Steele also \nfiled a response to the freeze motion in her individual capacity, R. 245, Steele Resp. \nBr., though she notes that the CDC has adopted her response, R. 248. A motion \nhearing was held on the freeze motion on August 21, 2020. R. 252. For the reasons \nexplained below, the motion to freeze is granted in part and denied in part: financial \ncontrols and limits will be imposed, but the Court will not impose an across-the-board \nfreeze that completely disables the CDC from operating.  \nI. Legal Standard \nA preliminary injunction under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nis “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the \nplaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n7, 22 (2008). A party seeking to obtain a preliminary injunction must demonstrate: \n(1) that the case has some likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that no adequate \nremedy at law exists; and (3) that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is \nnot granted. Orr v. Shicker, 953 F.3d 490, 502 (7th Cir. 2020). If the moving party \nmeets these threshold requirements, then the Court must balance the nature and \ndegree of the potential harm to each party and the public interest. Girl Scouts of \nManitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts, Inc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008).  \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 4 of 11 PageID #:893\nWhen it comes to asset freezes in particular, the general rule is that a district \ncourt may not freeze a party’s assets merely to preserve another party’s right to \nrecover  money  damages  at  a  later  stage  in  the  litigation.  Grupo  Mexicano  de \nDesarrollo v. Alliance Bond Fund, 527 U.S. 308, 330 (1999). Beyond that, though, \ncourts do have the authority to preliminarily retrain assets pursuant to a request for \nequitable relief,2 which is what is at issue in this case. See CSC Holdings, Inc. v. \nRedisi, 309 F.3d 988, 996 (7th Cir. 2002) (affirming asset freeze where party sought \nan accounting and profits remedy) (cleaned up). \nII. Analysis \nA. Jurisdiction \n  Before getting to the heart of the dispute, two jurisdictional hurdles must first \nbe overcome. First, the LAC and the CDC argue that this Court has no authority over \nthe CDC, which was not a named party to either the underlying litigation or the \nConsent Decree. LAC Resp. Br. at 3-4. But for purposes of the dispute over developer \nfees and profits, that stance is not persuasive. The Court has broad authority to \nenforce the Consent Decree. See Consent Decree § XII. More to the point, the Consent \nDecree specifically contemplated the creation of the LAC’s “affiliated development \nentity,” which would be hold the ownership interest in housing developments and \nreceive the developer fees and profits. Id. § III.A.1. The CDC indisputably is the LAC’s \n“affiliated development entity” as that term is used in the Consent Decree. It appears \n \n2This Order uses (cleaned up) to indicate that internal quotation marks, alterations, \nand citations have been omitted from quotations. See Jack Metzler, Cleaning Up Quotations, \n18 Journal of Appellate Practice and Process 143 (2017). \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 5 of 11 PageID #:894\nthat the Consent Decree’s grant of ownership and developer fees-and-profits make up \nthe bulk of the CDC’s revenue, and the Consent Decree sets out the standard for the \nexpenditure  of  those  funds:  “for  not-for-profit  purposes  to  benefit  current  and \ndisplaced Cabrini-Green residents,” id. § III.A.1; § III.A.6. The CDC’s role as the \naffiliated development entity under the Consent Decree makes it subject to the \nCourt’s jurisdiction when enforcing the Consent Decree. That role too is why the \nCourt permitted Steele’s proposed intervention response to stand-in for the CDC’s \nresponse (after the CDC affirmed its adoption of the response). \n  The second jurisdictional hurdle is advanced by Steele, who implies that the \nCHA lacks “standing” to challenge the CDC’s use of the funds. Steele Resp. Br. at 8. \nAgain, this argument is not persuasive. The CHA is a party to the Consent Decree, \nso it has a sufficient legal interest in the money that the Consent Decree funnels to \nthe CDC. Indeed, it is CHA-owned land on which the housing developments—which \nare the source of the CDC’s developer-paid fees and profits—are being built. Consent \nDecree § III.A.1. To be clear, it is not so much that the CHA can lay claim to the funds \nthemselves. But the CHA negotiated a Consent Decree that provides for a specified \nuse of the moneys derived from CHA-owned land. As a party to the Consent Decree, \nthen, the CHA has a legally cognizable interest in enforcing the provision that \nspecifies how the money must be spent. Standing is secure. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 6 of 11 PageID #:895\nB. Likelihood of Success \n  Turning to the substance of the freeze motion, the first question is whether the \nCHA3 is likely to succeed on the merits of the underlying motion to enforce and to \nmodify the Consent Decree. On the current record, that bar has easily been met.  \n   The OIG Report dominates the current factual record, with little to rebut it, at \nleast so far. At this stage of the dispute, the Report sufficiently establishes that the \nCDC has spent Consent-Decree-dictated funds without sufficient recordkeeping to \nensure that the funds were spent on non-profit purposes only; and worse that the \nCDC has indeed actually misspent funds. To be clear, it is always possible that \nfurther factual development would alter this preliminary finding, but right now the \nrecord evidence points this way.  \n  The OIG Report explains that the CDC spent $264,000 on “Management and \nGeneral Expenses,” much of which was not supported with records showing that the \npayments  were  made  for  non-profit  purposes  to  benefit  displaced  and  current \nCabrini-Green residents. Lischka Decl. ¶ 73(e); OIG Report at 24 (listing payments). \nOf more immediate concern are the potential misuse of the funds, including:  \n  $25,106 in checks made out to petty cash, most of which did not have \nany record of the money’s purpose. Lischka Decl. ¶ 68; OIG Report at \n21-22.  \n \n  $52,259 in contractor payments to Charles Price, who has never resided \nin public housing and lives in Indiana—but is the father of Steele’s sons. \nLischka Decl. ¶ 51; OIG Report at 17-18. \n \n \n  3For convenience’s sake, the Order refers to the CHA and the City as just the CHA, \nbecause both of the Defendants stake out a joint position for purposes of the current dispute. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 7 of 11 PageID #:896\n  $2,500 in funeral expenses for Steele’s brother, who at the time of his \npassing was not a current or displaced Cabrini-Green resident. Lischka \nDecl. ¶ 60; OIG Report at 19. \n \n  Although the LAC and Steele broadly suggest that the factual allegations in \nthe OIG Report are inaccurate, the response briefs themselves do not really offer any \nhelpful counter-evidence to dispel the findings of the OIG Report. The CHA is likely \nto succeed in showing that funds were spent on personal purposes in violation of the \nConsent Decree’s requirement that the funds be set aside for non-profit purposes.  \nC. Inadequate Remedy and Irreparable Harm \n  Moving on from likelihood of success, the CHA also has sufficiently shown that \nthere is no adequate remedy at law and that there will be irreparable harm if some \nsort of preliminary relief is not granted. Put simply, the time urgency arises directly \nfrom the evidence that the CDC is misusing funds under the Consent Decree. If more \nmoney is misspent, there is every reason to believe that it will be difficult to claw \nback the money to replenish what is supposed to be a pool of funds for non-profit \npurposes. It is no answer, as Steele argues, to say simply that a “judicial order to \nreturn” any misused funds would alleviate the harm. Steele Resp. Br. at 9. Yes, \nmoney in general is fungible, but the funds funneled by the Consent Decree is sourced \nfrom CHA-owned land and thus is derived from public coffers. Nor is there any \nassurance that recipients of misspent funds have sufficient assets from which to \ncollect even if ordered to pay back the money. So there is no adequate remedy at law \nand, correspondingly, there is a serious risk that the beneficiaries of the Consent \nDecree will suffer irreparable harm if more moneys are misspent.  \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 8 of 11 PageID #:897\nIt is worth noting that the CHA’s failure to timely confer with the LAC and the \nCDC on the motion to enforce (as well as on this freeze motion) normally would count \nagainst the argument that irreparable harm is nigh. The alarm bells rang with the \nissuance of the OIG Report on May 21, 2020. But the CHA waited to “confer,” if it \ncould be called that, with the LAC until the very day the CHA filed the motion on \nJuly 21. Still, this misstep in litigation strategy ultimately does not diminish the facts \nset forth in the OIG Report and the valid concern over the potential irrecoverable loss \nof non-profit funds.  \nD. Balance of Harms \n  Finally,  the  balance  of  harms  weighs  heavily  in  favor  of  allowing  for \npreliminary relief in this case, as does the public interest. To the extent that the LAC \nand the CDC are concerned that a preliminary asset freeze will potentially get in the \nway of legitimate efforts to spend money for the benefit of Cabrini-Green residents or \nto retain outside professional help (like an accountant), Steele Resp. Br. at 13-14, \nnothing in this Order will stop the CDC from doing that. As described in more detail \nbelow, the Court declines to issue a full-on asset freeze precisely to avoid disabling \nthe CDC from legitimate efforts to pursue to the important goals of the Consent \nDecree. And nothing in this Order is meant to suggest that the LAC and CDC have \nnot done any legitimate work in support of Cabrini-Green residents. But the financial \ncontrols will not prevent the CDC from spending money altogether.  \n  Weighed against this, if no preliminary relief is given, then there is a real risk \nof the irreparable harm of misspent funds. With no transparency into even the most \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 9 of 11 PageID #:898\nbasic information about the CDC’s current financial status, it will be immensely \ndifficult later on to determine whether the spending that happens during this interim \nperiod was in violation of the Consent Decree, or indeed to even determine whether \nany spending happened at all. In the interest of not losing track of any more of the \nmoney meant to benefit Cabrini-Green’s current and displaced residents, the Court \nconcludes that some interim relief short of an asset freeze is justified in this case \nwhile the parties take their time to work toward a longer-term solution. \nIII. Conclusion \n  On balance, interim relief is clearly warranted here, though short of a full asset \nfreeze. As alluded to above, the parties have agreed to participate in a settlement \nconference in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the CDC may continue to spend \nits funds on legitimate, non-profit objectives, subject to contemporaneous monitoring \nrequirements set forth below. If this contemporaneous monitoring proves insufficient \nto curb the present concerns, then the CHA may move to escalate the preliminary \nrelief. By the same token, if a record of trust is built, then the monitoring can be \nstepped down to some degree. For now, though, the LAC and CDC will be subject to \nthe following requirements:  \n  The CDC shall provide written confirmation to its lawyers, the LAC’s \nlawyers, and to counsel for the CHA and the City that there are no \nadditional CDC bank accounts beyond the three accounts listed in \nthe freeze motion. See R. 242 ¶ 10. For each of the CDC’s bank \naccounts, the CDC shall also provide to the same recipients either a \nprintout or screenshot of the most recent monthly statement. There \nis no need, for now, to provide a more detailed breakdown of assets \nor proposed budget. The confirmation and monthly statements are \ndue by August 26, 2020. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 10 of 11 PageID #:899\n  For all future spending and withdrawals from any of the CDC bank \naccounts, the CDC must provide supporting documentation (such as \nreceipts, invoices, or contracts) to counsel for the LAC, the CDC, the \nCHA, and the City) within one business day of each expenditure.4  \n \n  For all proposed checks for petty-cash purposes, the CDC must file a \nmotion detailing the anticipated need for the cash. If approved, then \nthe  CDC  still  must  provide  supporting  documentation  (such  as \nreceipts, invoices, or contracts) to counsel for the LAC, the CDC, the \nCHA, and the City within one business day of the expenditure.  \n \n  On the Wednesday of each week, starting on September 2, 2020, the \nCDC must disclose either a printout or screenshot from the online \ntransaction summaries for each of the CDC’s bank accounts covering \nthe  prior  seven  days  (so  the  first  period  is  August  26  through \nSeptember  1).  The  weekly  disclosures  are  required  even  if  no \ntransactions have been made.  \n \no  After 21 days (that is, after the September 23 disclosure), the \ndisclosure will only be required once every 14 days and cover \nthe prior 14 days (that is, October 7 will be the next disclosure \ndeadline after September 23).  \n \n  When  the  CDC  is  ready  to  retain  professional services (such as \naccountants, auditors, or lawyers), the CDC must confer with the \nLAC, the CHA, and the City before entering into a binding contract. \nThe conferral shall include disclosure of the proposed contract. The \nCHA and the City shall provide a response within three business \ndays of the conferral and shall not withhold reasonable consent, but \nif either of the Defendants object, then the CDC must obtain Court \napproval before retaining the proposed service provider.  \n \nWith these limits in place, the Court expects that the time urgency on the \nunderlying motion will dissipate and that the LAC, the CDC, the CHA, and the City \nwill have enough time to engage in good-faith settlement efforts. That being said, the \n \n4This one-day reporting requirement is not intended to be overly burdensome on the \nCDC. Indeed, during the August 21, 2020 status hearing, counsel for Steele explained that \nhe was not aware of any immediate or recurring payments that the CDC would need to make \nwithin the next week. So, the CDC shall ideally have some time over the next week to adjust \nto this new requirement. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:96-cv-06949 Document #: 254 Filed: 08/22/20 Page 11 of 11 PageID #:900\nCourt strongly encourages the LAC and the CDC to act more nimbly going forward, \nthough it is understandable that the pandemic and the financial disadvantages of the \ndecision-makers have been obstacles to quick action. Hopefully other measures, such \nas conferring litigation authority on smaller subcommittees of the respective boards, \ncan expedite the pace of decision-making. By the same token, the CHA too must more \npromptly engage in conferral before resorting to motion practice. All in all, no doubt \nall of the case participants now must work together toward achieving the Consent \nDecree’s  goal  of  providing  non-profit  assistance  to  Cabrini-Green’s  current  and \ndisplaced resident.  \nWith the settlement referral in place to the magistrate judge, R. 253, this Court \nsets a status hearing (to track the case only, no appearance is required) for October \n9, 2020, at 8:30 a.m.  \n \nENTERED:   \n \n \n                           \n                Honorable Edmond E.
