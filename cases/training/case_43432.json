    "summary": "<p>This case is about whether the Food and Nutrition Act (&ldquo;FNA&rdquo;) (7 U.S.C. &sect; 2011, <em>et seq.</em>) and Title IX (20 U.S.C. &sect; 1681, <em>et seq.</em>) permit states to categorically refuse low income individuals federally funded food-assistance benefits on the basis of gender identity. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (&ldquo;USDA&rdquo;), through the Food and Nutrition Service (&ldquo;FNS&rdquo;), administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (&ldquo;SNAP&rdquo;). SNAP is implemented through cooperative grant agreements between the federal government and the states. States operate SNAP in accordance with federal law and regulations. Title IX and the FNA condition states&rsquo; receipt of SNAP federal funds, in part, on the states&rsquo; compliance with nondiscrimination provisions.</p>\r\n<p>In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/17313/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bostock v. Clayton</a></em>&nbsp;that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&rsquo;s prohibition on sex discrimination included discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. In light of the decision, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies to evaluate whether their regulations and other agency actions were inconsistent with prohibitions on sex discrimination, including sexual-orientation and gender identity discrimination. On May 5, 2022, USDA issued a memorandum (&ldquo;the Memo&rdquo;) stating that Title IX and the FNA also prohibited discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, based on the agency&rsquo;s interpretation of <em>Bostock</em>. The agency supplemented the Memo with additional guidance directing states to update all SNAP &ldquo;documents, pamphlets, websites, etc.&rdquo; with a nondiscrimination statement including prohibitions on sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. Additionally, on June 14, 2022, USDA issued a rule (&ldquo;Final Rule&rdquo;) requiring states to include language in their SNAP educational materials barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>\r\n<p>On July 26, 2022, twenty-two states with Republican attorney generals, led by Tennessee, filed a lawsuit against USDA in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The case was assigned to Judge Travis McDonough. In their complaint, the states alleged that the Memo and Final Rule both violated the Administrative Procedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;) (5 U.S.C. &sect; 533, <em>et seq.</em>). The plaintiffs claimed that the agency&rsquo;s actions were arbitrary and capricious, violated procedural requirements, and were contrary to Title IX, the FNA, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, and the separation of powers. Central to plaintiffs claims was a contention that the Memo and the Final Rule prohibited gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination &ldquo;at the institutional level,&rdquo; including &ldquo;issues related to maintaining sex separated bathrooms and locker rooms, offering sex-separated athletic teams, or using biologically accurate pronouns.&rdquo; Represented by their respective attorney general offices, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the Memo and Final Rule and declaratory relief.</p>\r\n<p>On July 26, 2022, plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin the USDA from enforcing the Memo and Final Rule and requested an expedited hearing on the matter. On August 10, 2022, Judge McDonough denied plaintiffs&rsquo; request for an expedited hearing, citing a lack of good cause shown by the plaintiffs. 2022 WL 5336196. On September 29, 2022, both plaintiffs and USDA agreed to waive the preliminary injunction hearing. On December 5, 2022, USDA moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2023, Judge McDonough denied plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction and granted the agency&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. Judge McDonough first evaluated the motion to dismiss. He first found that the states had standing to sue USDA and that both the Memo and Final Rule were subject to APA requirements. However, he held that the agency complied with the APA&rsquo;s procedural requirements and did not act arbitrarily and capriciously by not considering states&rsquo; interests in sex-separated living facilities because the Final Rule did not impact those interests in any way. Additionally, Judge McDonough found that Title IX and the FNA unambiguously prohibited gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination in the administration of SNAP. Finally, Judge McDonough dismissed all constitutional challenges to the Final Rule, finding no violation of the Spending Clause, First Amendment, Tenth Amendment, or separation of powers. Thus, given that all claims were dismissed, Judge McDonough denied the motion for preliminary injunction since there was &ldquo;no likelihood of success on the merits.&rdquo; 665 F.Supp.3d 880.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

BACKGROUND \n \nA.  Executive Order 13,988 \nIn Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), the United States \nSupreme Court held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s (“Title VII”) prohibition on \ndiscrimination “because of . . . sex” includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity and \nsexual orientation.  In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock, on January 20, 2021, \nPresident Biden issued an executive order instructing agencies to review their regulations and \nother agency actions to evaluate whether any such actions may be inconsistent with Title VII or \nother statutory prohibitions on sex discrimination, including sexual-orientation and gender-\nidentity discrimination.  Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender \nIdentity or Sexual Orientation, 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021) [hereinafter “Executive Order \n13,988”].  Executive Order 13,988 set forth the following review process:   \n(a)  The head of each agency shall, as soon as practicable and in consultation with \nthe Attorney General, as appropriate, review all existing orders, regulations, \nguidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions (“agency \nactions”) that: \n(i)  were promulgated or are administered by the agency under Title VII or \nany other statute or regulation that prohibits sex discrimination, including \nany that relate to the agency’s own compliance with such statutes or \nregulations; and  \n(ii)  are or may be inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this \norder [interpreting statutory prohibitions on sex discrimination to prohibit \ngender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination]. \n(b)  The head of each agency shall, as soon as practicable and as appropriate and \nconsistent with applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act (5 \nU.S.C. 551 et seq.), consider whether to revise, suspend, or rescind such \nagency actions, or promulgate new agency actions, as necessary to fully \n2 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 2 of 56   PageID #: 945\n\nimplement statutes that prohibit sex discrimination and the policy set forth in \nsection 1 of this order. \n(c)  The head of each agency shall, as soon as practicable, also consider whether \nthere are additional actions that the agency should take to ensure that it is fully \nimplementing the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.  If an agency takes \nan action described in this subsection or subsection (b) of this section, it shall \nseek to ensure that it is accounting for, and taking appropriate steps to combat, \noverlapping forms of discrimination, such as discrimination on the basis of \nrace or disability. \n(d)  Within 100 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall \ndevelop, in consultation with the Attorney General, as appropriate, a plan to \ncarry out actions that the agency has identified pursuant to subsections (b) and \n(c) of this section, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. \nId. at 7023–24.  Defendant United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) conducted its \nreview in accordance with Executive Order 13,988 and, therefore, examined the \nnondiscrimination provisions governing the programs and activities it funds.  See Memorandum \nfrom Roberto Contreras, Director of the Civil Rights Division of the Food and Nutrition Service, \nCRD 01-2022, Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint \nProcessing – Policy Update (May 5, 2022), https://www.fns.usda.gov/cr/crd-01-2022 (on file \nwith USDA) [hereinafter “May 5 Memo”]. \nB.  SNAP and SNAP-Ed \nOne such program, administered and funded by the USDA’s subagency, the Food and \nNutrition Service (“FNS”), is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”).  7 \nU.S.C. §§ 2012(p), 2020.  The purpose of SNAP is “[t]o alleviate [] hunger and malnutrition,” \nand it “permit[s] low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal \nchannels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for \nparticipation.”  7 U.S.C. § 2011.  SNAP operates through cooperative grant agreements between \nthe states and the federal government called Federal-State Agreements (“FSAs”).  7 C.F.R. \n§ 272.2(a)(2), (b); 7 U.S.C. § 2020(d)–(e).  “The FSA is the legal agreement between the \n3 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 3 of 56   PageID #: 946\n\n[USDA] and the State agency by which the State elects to operate SNAP doing so in accordance \nwith the [FNA], SNAP regulations, the State Plan of Operation (State Plan), civil rights laws, \nand civil rights regulations.”  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:  Civil Rights Update \nto the Federal-State Agreement, 87 Fed. Reg. 35,855, 35,855 (June 14, 2022) (codified at 7 \nC.F.R. § 272.2) [hereinafter the “Final Rule”].  USDA requires states to include in their FSAs \ncertain standardized language, which is implemented through statutes and regulations.  7 C.F.R. \n§ 272.2(a)(2), (b); 7 U.S.C. § 2020(d)–(e).   \nIf a state does not include the standardized language required in their FSAs, or otherwise \nfails to comply with statutory and regulatory SNAP requirements, USDA can follow an \nenforcement procedure:   \nIf the State agency does not correct such failure within [the Secretary of \nAgriculture’s] specified period, the Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney \nGeneral with a request that injunctive relief be sought to require compliance \nforthwith by the State agency and, upon suit by the Attorney General in an \nappropriate district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the \ngeographic area in which the State agency is located and a showing that \nnoncompliance has occurred, appropriate injunctive relief shall issue, and, \nwhether or not the Secretary refers such matter to the Attorney General, the \nSecretary shall proceed to withhold from the State such funds authorized under \nsections 2025(a), 2025(c), and 2025(g) of this title as the Secretary determines to \nbe appropriate, subject to administrative and judicial review under section 2023 of \nthis title. \n \n7 U.S.C. § 2020(g).   \n  FNS also administers Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (“SNAP-\nEd”).  (Doc. 54-1, at 4.)2  SNAP-Ed is a much smaller program than SNAP and exists only to \n \n2 In this paragraph, the Court references and relies on information contained in a declaration \n(Doc. 54-1) attached to Defendants’ response to Plaintiff States’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction.  The Court uses the facts contained in the declaration merely to provide background \ninformation on the SNAP-Ed program, these facts are supported by the public record, and \nPlaintiff States do not dispute these facts.  (See Docs. 1, 59, 78); Food & Nutrition Serv., U.S. \nDep’t of Agric., FY 2023 Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) Plan \n \n4 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 4 of 56   PageID #: 947\n\nprovide nutrition education in a wide variety of settings.  (Id.)  FNS awards grants to states to \noperate SNAP-Ed, and states sometimes select schools as implementing agencies for the \nprogram.  (Id.)  Nonetheless, “FNS’s concern with any school involved with SNAP-Ed, either as \nan implementing agency or as a Program site, is limited strictly to the scope of the SNAP-Ed \nProgram and ensuring individuals eligible for participation in SNAP-Ed have access to the \nprogram.”  (Id. at 4–5.)  Indeed, “SNAP-Ed’s purpose and scope do not concern school \nbathrooms, school sports teams, school dress codes, or other such areas of concern referenced in \nPlaintiffs’ complaint.”  (Id. at 5.) \nC.  The Memoranda \ni.  May 5 Memo \n \nTitle IX and the FNA are statutes that condition states’ receipt of federal funds, in part, \non the states’ compliance with their nondiscrimination provisions, and FNS enforces these \nprovisions as to SNAP funding.  7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1), (g); 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a), 1682.  As a \nresult of USDA’s review pursuant to Executive Order 13,988, on May 5, 2022, USDA issued a \nmemorandum (the “May 5 Memo”) announcing the agency’s interpretation of the prohibitions on \nsex discrimination contained in the FNA and Title IX.  May 5 Memo.   \n In the May 5 Memo, USDA interprets the sex-discrimination prohibitions in Title IX and \nthe FNA as analogous to the Title VII prohibition and, relying on Bostock, concludes that Title \nIX and the FNA also prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.  Id.  \nThe May 5 Memo states, “[t]his means that the certification of applicant households for SNAP \nshall be conducted without discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.”  \n \nGuidance (2023).  Therefore, the Court need not convert Defendants’ Rule 12 motion (Doc. 70) \nto a Rule 56 motion.  See Com. Money Ctr., Inc. v. Ill. Union Ins. Co., 508 F.3d 327, 335–36 (6th \nCir. 2007). \n5 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 5 of 56   PageID #: 948\n\nId.  USDA’s May 5 Memo directs state agencies to “expeditiously review their program \ndiscrimination complaint procedures and make any changes necessary to ensure complaints \nalleging discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation are processed and \nevaluated as complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Id.   \nThe May 5 Memo also states that “[s]tate agencies and program operators are advised \nthat the interpretation outlined in this memo does not determine the outcome in any particular \ncase, which will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of that case.”  Id.  Further, \n“[a]ny action taken by USDA in a specific case will take account of all relevant facts and legal \nrequirements, including, where applicable, Title IX’s religious exemption, the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq., and any other applicable exemptions.”  Id.   \nii.  Cover Letter \n \nContemporaneously with the May 5 Memo, USDA issued a cover letter, a “Questions \nand Answers” document, and a supplemental memorandum regarding timelines and guidelines \nfor implementing the revised nondiscrimination statement and posters.  (collectively, with the \nMay 5 Memo, the “Memoranda”).  May 5 Memo; Cover Letter to CRD 01-2022, Application of \nBostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing, from Roberto \nContreras, Director of the Civil Rights Division of the Food and Nutrition Service, (May 5, \n2022), https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/crd-01-2022-letter.pdf (on \nfile with USDA) [hereinafter “Cover Letter”]; Memorandum from Roberto Contreras, Questions \nand Answers Related to CRD 01-2022 Application of Bostock v.

The Cover Letter states that USDA’s \n6 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 6 of 56   PageID #: 949\n\nnew policy “applies to prohibitions against discrimination based on sex in all FNS programs[,]” \nrecognizing that “these changes may impact [State and local] operations.”  Cover Letter.  \niii.  Q&A Document \n \nThe Q&A informs state agencies that they must “update their program discrimination \ncomplaint processing procedures for allegations related to services and activities receiving \nfederal financial assistance from [] USDA to ensure discrimination complaints alleging sexual \norientation and gender identity discrimination are processed as complaints of prohibited sex \ndiscrimination.”  Q&A, at 2.  The document also links to a USDA site where the updated \nnondiscrimination statement was to be posted once USDA made it available.  Id.  Following that \nlink, the updated nondiscrimination statement that USDA now requires states to post reads, “this \ninstitution is prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex \n(including gender identity and sexual orientation), disability, age, or reprisal or retaliation for \nprior civil rights activity.”  USDA Nondiscrimination Statement, https://www.fns.usda.gov/civil-\nrights/usda-nondiscrimination-statement-snap-fdpir (Feb. 15, 2023) (emphasis added) \n[hereinafter “Public-Notification Statement”].   \niv.  Supplemental Memo \n \nThe Supplemental Memo directs states to update all “documents, pamphlets, websites, \netc.” with a nondiscrimination statement revised to include sexual-orientation and gender-\nidentity discrimination as follows: \n1. Websites must be updated within 90 days of the date of this memorandum. \n2. Documents, pamphlets, brochures, etc., using 2015 [Nondiscrimination \nStatement (“NDS”)] language must be updated when current supply on hand is \nexhausted or by September 30, 2023. \n3. All new printing must use the 2022 NDS. \n7 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 7 of 56   PageID #: 950\n\n(Doc. 1-4, at 2.)  The Supplemental Memo also states that USDA will order and ship new “And \nJustice for All posters,” referencing gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination, which \nshould be posted at all state and local agencies that receive FNS funds.  (Id. at 2–3.) \nD.  USDA Final Rule \nThe challenged Final Rule, 7 C.F.R. § 272.2, updates the SNAP-civil-rights-assurance \ntemplate language for the states’ FSAs.  On November 17, 2016, USDA issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking (the “NPRM”), which proposed an update to the language required in the \nstates’ FSAs to include the following language:   \nThe State agrees to: . . .  Comply with . . .  Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), [and] section 11(c) of the Food and Nutrition \nAct of 2008, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2020), . . . to the effect that, no person in the \nUnited States shall, on the grounds of sex . . . be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subject to discrimination under SNAP. \n \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:  Civil Rights Update to the Federal-State \nAgreement, 81 Fed. Reg. 81,015, 81,017 (Nov. 17, 2016) [hereinafter the “NPRM”].   \nOn June 14, 2022, USDA issued the Final Rule based on the NPRM, but the required \nFSA language in the Final Rule differed slightly from the NPRM’s proposed FSA language:  the \nFinal Rule added the clause “including gender identity and sexual orientation” after the word \n“sex” in the original language.  87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857 (“[N]o person in the United States shall, \non the grounds of sex, including gender identity and sexual orientation, . . . be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subject to discrimination under \nSNAP.”) (emphasis added).  The Final Rule explained its reasoning for updating the FSA civil-\nrights assurance language: \nCodifying civil rights protections is vital to the success of SNAP because it \nsupports the Department in providing equitable and superior customer service to \nall SNAP applicants and recipients.  The protections included in this rule will \nprevent discrimination and systemic racism in the SNAP program that could \n8 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 8 of 56   PageID #: 951\n\nnegatively impact program access and outcomes.  Integrating additional civil \nrights language into the FSA ensures a consistent application of these practices \nacross the program. \n \n87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855. \nE.  Procedural History   \nPlaintiff States filed the complaint, initiating the present action, on July 26, 2022.  (Doc. \n1.)  While Plaintiff States acknowledge that they do not “deny SNAP certification of applicant \nhouseholds based on household members’ sexual orientation or gender identity,” which is the \nonly conduct that the Memoranda and Final Rule newly interpret Title IX and FNA to proscribe, \nthey nonetheless insist that the Memoranda and Final Rule will have wide-ranging impacts at the \ninstitutional level, from banning sex-separated restrooms to impeding the free-speech rights of \nstate-employed professors.  (Id. at 9, 23, 26–28.)  Further, they allege standing on the basis that \n“[t]he Memoranda and Final Rule impose immediate administrative and compliance costs and \nburdens on Plaintiffs and other regulated entities.”  (Id. at 29.)    \nAs such, Plaintiff States claim that:  (1) the Memoranda and Final Rule violated the \nprocedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 533, et seq. (“APA”); \n(2) the Memoranda and Final Rule are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; (3) the \nMemoranda and Final Rule are contrary to Title IX, in violation of the APA; (4) the Memoranda \nand Final Rule are contrary to the FNA, in violation of the APA; (5) the Memoranda and Final \nRule are contrary to the spending clause of the constitution, in violation of the APA; (6) the \nMemoranda and Final Rule are contrary to the First Amendment, in violation of the APA; (7) the \nMemoranda and Final Rule are contrary to the Tenth Amendment and the anticommandeering \ndoctrine, in violation of the APA; and (8) the Memoranda and Final Rule are contrary to \nseparation of powers and the nondelegation doctrine, in violation of the APA.  (Doc. 1, at 29–\n9 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 9 of 56   PageID #: 952\n\n47.)  Many of these claims turn on Plaintiff States’ contention that the Memoranda and Final \nRule prohibit all gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination “at the institutional level,” \ndespite Defendants’ express assurances that the Memoranda and Final Rule relate only to the \nadministration of SNAP and do not “bear on issues related to ‘maintaining sex separated \nbathrooms and locker rooms, offering sex-separated athletic teams, or using biologically accurate \npronouns[.]’”  (Doc. 1, at 3, 23–28; Doc. 54, at 41; Doc. 78, at 17.)  Contemporaneously with the \ncomplaint, Plaintiff States filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants and \ntheir agents from enforcing the Memoranda and Final Rule against Plaintiff States.  (Doc. 2.)   \nThe Court denied Plaintiff States’ request for an expedited hearing on the motion for \npreliminary injunction because Defendants had not received notice and a fair opportunity to \noppose the motion for preliminary injunction, and Plaintiffs did not show good cause as to why \nthe hearing should be expedited.  (Doc. 33, at 4–5 (“While Plaintiff States’ briefing certainly \nidentifies a general clash of competing cultural norms between agency policies and state laws, it \ndoes not explain how incorporating the Rule’s language, regarding only SNAP benefits, would \nimpact their state laws regarding sports participation, restroom use, religious freedom, or free \nspeech.”).)  Defendants subsequently responded to the motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. \n54) and responded to the complaint by filing a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim (Doc. 70).  Plaintiff States’ motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 2) and \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss (Doc. 70) are now ripe for the Court’s review.   \nII.  MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD OF REVIEW \n  \nAccording to Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff’s complaint must \ncontain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  Though the statement need not contain detailed factual allegations, it \n10 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 10 of 56   PageID #: 953\n\nmust contain “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nRule 8 “demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.”  \nId.   \nA defendant may obtain dismissal of a claim that fails to satisfy Rule 8 by filing a motion \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court considers not whether the \nplaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the facts permit the court to infer “more than the \nmere possibility of misconduct.”  Id. at 679.  For purposes of this determination, the Court \nconstrues the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and assumes the veracity of all \nwell-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint.  Thurman v. Pfizer, Inc., 484 F.3d 855, 859 \n(6th Cir. 2007).  This assumption of veracity, however, does not extend to bare assertions of \nlegal conclusions, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679, nor is the Court “bound to accept as true a legal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation,” Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).   \nAfter sorting the factual allegations from the legal conclusions, the Court next considers \nwhether the factual allegations, if true, would support a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief.  \nThurman, 484 F.3d at 859.  This factual matter must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  Plausibility “is not akin to a \n‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  “[W]here the well-\npleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the \ncomplaint has alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  \n11 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 11 of 56   PageID #: 954\n\nIII.  MOTION TO DISMISS ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Justiciability \ni.  Plaintiff States have standing to challenge the Memoranda and Final Rule. \n \nDefendants first move to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that \nPlaintiff States’ allegations do not satisfy the requirement of standing.  (Doc. 71, at 16–19.)  \n“Article III of the U.S. Constitution permits federal courts to adjudicate ‘cases or controversies,’ \nnot any political dispute that happens to arise between the state and federal executive branches.”  \nArizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 383 (6th Cir. 2022).  The case-or-controversy requirement of \nArticle III, Section 2 mandates that a plaintiff have standing in order to sue.  Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  To have standing, a plaintiff must have “(1) suffered an \ninjury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that \nis likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Daunt v. Benson, 956 F.3d 396, 417 \n(6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016)).  An injury, for \nstanding purposes, means the “invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized, and (b) ‘actual or imminent.’”  Id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  “For an \ninjury to be ‘particularized,’ it ‘must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual \nway.’”  Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339.  A “concrete” injury-in-fact does not have to be tangible, but it \nmust be “‘real,’ and not ‘abstract.’”  Id. at 340.  Further, “[w]here plaintiffs seek to establish \nstanding based on an imminent injury, the Supreme Court has explained ‘that “threatened injury \nmust be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact,” and that “[a]llegations of possible \nfuture injury” are not sufficient.’”  Galaria v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 663 F. App’x 384, 388 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (first alteration added) (emphasis in original) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l \n12 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 12 of 56   PageID #: 955\n\nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).  The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that standing \nexists.  Id. at 387 (citing Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009)).   \nWhen sovereign states file suit as plaintiffs in federal court, they are entitled to special \nsolicitude.  Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 3:21-cv-308, 2022 WL 2791450, at *5 (E.D. \nTenn. July 15, 2022) (citing Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007)).  In \nMassachusetts, the Supreme Court noted that “[i]t is of considerable relevance that the party \nseeking review here is a sovereign State and not . . . a private individual.”  549 U.S. at 518.  \nBecause “States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,” \nPlaintiff States are entitled to “special solicitude” in the Court’s standing analysis.  Id. at 518, \n520; see also Arizona, 40 F.4th at 385–86 (explaining “States sometimes are entitled to ‘special \nsolicitude’ in this area because they may incur ‘quasi-sovereign’ injuries that private parties \ncannot”) (citing Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 517–20).  Nonetheless, the “special solicitude” \nafforded to states does not eliminate the core standing requirements of an injury-in-fact, \ncausation, and redressability.  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 517–20; Arizona, 40 F.4th at 385–86.   \na.  The compliance costs Plaintiff States allege they must incur  \nto comply with the Memoranda and Final Rule are a sufficient  \ninjury-in-fact to confer standing. \n \nPlaintiff States allege that they have suffered the following injuries-in-fact from the \nchallenged agency actions:  (1) an intrusion on Plaintiff States’ sovereign ability to enforce their \nown legal codes; (2) a credible threat of enforcement3 under Title IX and the FNA, which could \nresult in the loss of SNAP funding; and (3) the costs of complying with the challenged rules.  \n \n3 In a pre-enforcement suit, “a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement where he alleges \n‘an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but \n[arguably] proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution \nthereunder.’”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014) (quoting Babbitt v. \nUnited Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)).    \n13 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 13 of 56   PageID #: 956\n\n(Doc. 78, at 16–19.)  Because the third alleged injury, compliance costs, satisfies the injury-in-\nfact requirement, the Court will not consider whether the alleged intrusion on Plaintiff States’ \nsovereignty or threat of enforcement are independent injuries-in-fact sufficient to confer \nstanding. \nPlaintiff States have alleged that “[t]he Memoranda and Final Rule impose immediate \nadministrative and compliance costs and burdens on Plaintiffs and other regulated entities.”  \n(Doc. 1, at 29.)  While the Sixth Circuit has not directly addressed whether compliance costs \nassociated with a new regulation are sufficient injuries-in-fact to confer standing on regulated \nentities, the “loss of even a small amount of money is ordinarily an ‘injury’” for “standing \npurposes.”  Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 464 (2017).  Indeed, circuits that \nhave addressed this issue have uniformly held that compliance costs associated with a regulatory \nregime satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.  Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Boughton, \n988 F.3d 114, 121 (2d Cir. 2021) (“A regulated entity may plead an ‘injury in fact’ by plausibly \nalleging compliance costs associated with an increased regulatory burden. . . .  [T]he decisions of \nour sister circuits reflect a nearly uniform approach with which we agree.”) (collecting cases) \n(citations omitted), cert. denied,  142 S. Ct. 755 (2022); Am. Farm Bureau Fed’n v. EPA, 792 \nF.3d 281, 293 (3d Cir. 2015) (referring to compliance costs as “a classic injury-in-fact”); Liberty \nUniv., Inc. v. Lew, 733 F.3d 72, 90 (4th Cir. 2013) (holding that the plaintiff suffered an injury-\nin-fact because “it may well incur additional costs because of the administrative burden of \nassuring compliance with the employer mandate, or due to an increase in the cost of care”); \nContender Farms, L.L.P. v. USDA, 779 F.3d 258, 266 (5th Cir. 2015) (“An increased regulatory \nburden typically satisfies the injury in fact requirement.”) (citation omitted); State Nat’l Bank of \nBig Spring v. Lew, 795 F.3d 48, 53 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that regulated entities have \n14 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 14 of 56   PageID #: 957\n\nstanding when they “must incur costs to ensure that they are properly complying with the terms” \nof a new regulatory regime).  Given this uniform approach and the special solicitude owed to the \nstates, the Court finds that Plaintiff States’ allegation that they will incur significant compliance \ncosts under the Memoranda and Final Rule demonstrates an injury-in-fact.  \nb.  The injury-in-fact is traceable to the Memoranda and Final Rule  \nbecause they impose immediate compliance costs.  \n \nPlaintiff States’ obligation to spend funds to comply with the Memoranda and Final Rule \nis traceable to the challenged actions of USDA.  USDA’s May 5 Memo directs state agencies to \n“expeditiously review their program discrimination complaint procedures and make any changes \nnecessary to ensure complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual \norientation are processed and evaluated as complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex.”  \nMay 5 Memo.  The Q&A similarly informs state agencies that they must “update their program \ndiscrimination complaint processing procedures for allegations related to services and activities \nreceiving federal financial assistance from [] USDA to ensure discrimination complaints alleging \nsexual orientation and gender identity discrimination are processed as complaints of prohibited \nsex discrimination.”  Q&A, at 2.  The Supplemental Memo directs states to update all \n“documents, pamphlets, websites, etc.” with a nondiscrimination statement revised to include \nsexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination.  (Doc. 1-4, at 2.)  This requirement \nincludes the following steps:  \n1. Websites must be updated within 90 days of the date of this memorandum. \n2. Documents, pamphlets, brochures, etc., using 2015 [Nondiscrimination \nStatement (“NDS”)] language must be updated when current supply on hand is \nexhausted or by September 30, 2023. \n3. All new printing must use the 2022 NDS. \n15 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 15 of 56   PageID #: 958\n\n(Id.)  Plaintiff States plausibly allege that each of these requirements, imposed by USDA’s \nchallenged actions, imposes immediate costs to ensure that they comply.  (See Doc. 1, at 29.)  \nTherefore, they have shown that their injury-in-fact is fairly traceable to the challenged USDA \nactions.   \nc.  Plaintiff States’ injury of compliance costs is redressable by a favorable \ndecision setting aside the Memoranda and Final Rule.  \n \nFinally, Plaintiff States’ injury must be redressable by a favorable decision.  See Daunt, \n956 F.3d at 417.  Among other relief, Plaintiff States seek:  (1) “a declaratory judgment holding \nthat Plaintiffs are not bound by the Department’s Memoranda and Final Rule[;]” (2) “a judgment \nsetting aside the Memoranda and Final Rule[;]” and (3) “a preliminary and permanent injunction \nprohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and any other \npersons . . . from enforcing the Memoranda and Final Rule.”  (Doc. 1, at 49–50.)  This relief, if \ngranted by a favorable decision for Plaintiff States, would redress their injury-in-fact because \nthey would no longer be required to expend funds to comply with the Memoranda and Final Rule \nthat have been held unlawful and enjoined from enforcement.  (See id.)  Therefore, Plaintiff \nStates’ allegations are sufficient to confer standing. \nii.  Plaintiff States’ claims are ripe because the dispute over compliance costs is \nconcrete and imminent, and States would have to immediately expend funds \nto comply if the Court withheld consideration.  \n \nSimilarly, Plaintiff States have shown that their claims are ripe for review.  Federal courts \ndo not have jurisdiction over claims that are not ripe.  Norton v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 547, 554 (6th \nCir. 2002).  Standing and ripeness “‘originate from the same Article III limitation’ and may be \nanalyzed together as part of ‘standing’” because the inquiries often overlap.  Platt v. Bd. of \nComm’rs on Grievances & Discipline of Ohio Sup. Ct., 769 F.3d, 447, 451 (6th Cir. 2014).  \nRipeness is a justiciability doctrine designed “to prevent the courts, through premature \n16 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 16 of 56   PageID #: 959\n\nadjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.”  Ky. Press Ass’n v. \nKentucky, 454 F.3d 505, 509 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. \nCo., 473 U.S. 568, 580 (1985)).  “Ripeness becomes an issue when a case is anchored in future \nevents that may not occur as anticipated, or at all.”  Id. (quoting Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am. v. \nMagaw, 132 F.3d 272, 284 (6th Cir. 1997)).  Courts ask two questions to determine whether a \nclaim is ripe for judicial review:  “(1) is the claim ‘fit[] . . . for judicial decision’ in the sense that \nit arises in a concrete factual context and concerns a dispute that is likely to come to pass? and \n(2) what is ‘the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration’?”  Warshak v. United \nStates, 532 F.3d 521, 525 (6th Cir. 2008) (alterations in original) (citations omitted). \nDefendants argue that the alleged loss of significant federal funds if Plaintiff States fail to \ncomply is an insufficiently imminent injury that is unlikely to come to pass, and, therefore, \nPlaintiff States’ claims are unripe.  (Doc. 54, at 27–29.)  While the threat of future enforcement \nof the Memoranda and Final Rule, resulting in the loss of SNAP funding, is a remote possibility \nrequiring many intermediary contingencies before such a dispute comes to pass, Defendants’ \nargument ignores the immediate injury and concrete dispute over Plaintiff States’ compliance \ncosts.  See Magaw, 132 F.3d at 285 (“[A]ctual or imminent enforcement is not always a \nprerequisite [to standing and ripeness] in non-First Amendment cases, if the statute creates a \n‘present harm,’ such as substantial economic injury.”).  Plaintiff States’ claims are ripe because \nthey immediately face the obligation to spend funds to comply with the Memoranda and Final \nRule, both of which they assert are unlawful.  This is a concrete-and-particularized injury that is \nripe for adjudication.  Additionally, Plaintiff States would face hardship, albeit minor—the \nexpenditure of funds to comply with allegedly unlawful administrative actions—if the Court \n17 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 17 of 56   PageID #: 960\n\nwere to withhold consideration.  Therefore, Plaintiff States have satisfied the requirement to \nshow a substantial likelihood that their claims are ripe.   \niii.  The Memoranda are not final agency actions subject to APA review, \nbecause they do not determine rights or obligations. \n \nDefendants argue that the Memoranda4 are not reviewable by this Court because they are \nnot a final agency action.  (Doc. 54, at 33–36; Doc. 71, at 16.)  The APA “permits federal courts \nto review only ‘final agency action.’”  Arizona, 40 F.4th at 387 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 704).  “To \nqualify [as final agency action], the action must (1) ‘mark the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process’ and (2) be an action ‘by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.’”  Id. (quoting U.S. Army Corps. of \nEng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 597 (2016)).  The Sixth Circuit has articulated additional \n“guidance and sharpening inquiries” as to whether an agency action determines rights or \nobligations: \nWill the agency’s action impose liability on a regulated party, create legal rights, \nor mandate, bind, or limit other government actors in the future?  And will the \nagency’s action have a sufficiently direct and immediate impact on the aggrieved \nparty and a direct effect on its day-to-day business?  If an action maintains \nofficials’ independent decisionmaking and can be discretionarily relied on, it \nlikely lacks legal effect.  Through it all, we will not overlook whether the \nagency’s action puts a party to a “Catch-22,” stuck between heavy compliance \ncosts or feared liability, neither of which can be undone.  \n \nId. at 387 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  Further, the Sixth Circuit held that \nthe “telltale signs [] of a nonbinding policy statement” are:  (1) the labeling of a document as \n“guidelines;” (2) couching instructions with “lots of conditional language that preserves \nofficials’ discretion;” (3) providing “a ‘not exhaustive’ list of factors as ‘examples’ of what \nofficials should consider;” (4) allowing “officials to make decisions ‘depending on the facts’ or \n \n4 The parties do not dispute that the Final Rule is a final agency action subject to judicial review.  \n18 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 18 of 56   PageID #: 961\n\nleaving open prosecutorial discretion; and (5) stating that the document does not intend to create \nany right or benefit.  Id. at 387–88. \nIn this case, the Memoranda show the “telltale signs [] of a nonbinding policy statement,” \nlike the guidance at issue in Arizona.  See id.  The May 5 Memo is labeled as merely a “policy \nupdate.”  May 5 Memo.  The bulk of the May 5 Memo is dedicated to interpreting the text of \nexisting statutes, and the remainder is couched with conditional language that decisions under \nthose statutes will be made depending on the facts, thereby preserving officials’ discretion, and, \ntherefore, does not determine any rights or obligations.  Id. (“State agencies and program \noperators are advised that the interpretation outlined in this memo does not determine the \noutcome in any particular case, which will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of that \ncase.  Any action taken by USDA in a specific case will take account of all relevant facts and \nlegal requirements, including, where applicable, Title IX’s religious exemption, the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, 42 USC 2000bb et seq., and any other applicable exemptions.”).   \nTo escape the conclusion that the Memoranda are unreviewable under the APA, Plaintiff \nStates primarily rely on the notion that the Memoranda create “new law” and obligations, rather \nthan merely announcing USDA’s interpretations of Title IX and FNA, because the meaning of \nsex discrimination under those statutes does not encompass gender-identity and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  (Doc. 59, at 10; Doc. 78, at 16.)  As the Court will find with respect \nto Plaintiff States’ contrary-to-law claims, Title IX and FNA’s prohibitions on discrimination on \nthe basis of sex do, in fact, encompass prohibitions on gender-identity and sexual-orientation \ndiscrimination, at least insofar as the prohibition applies the administration of nutrition-\nassistance programs.  See infra Section III.B.  Therefore, Plaintiff States’ argument that the \nMemoranda create “new law,” rather than interpreting Title IX and FNA, is unavailing.   \n19 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 19 of 56   PageID #: 962\n\n  While Plaintiff States’ argument that the Memoranda are final agency actions rests \nprimarily on the notion that the Memoranda created “new law” with respect to Title IX and \nFNA’s sex-discrimination prohibitions, they also argue that less-significant administrative \nmeasures in the Memoranda also render them final agency actions because these administrative \ntasks are “new” obligations.  (Doc. 78, at 24–25.)  The Q&A states that “State Agencies and \nprogram operators will have to update their program discrimination complaint processing \nprocedures for allegations related to services and activities receiving federal financial assistance \nfrom [] USDA to ensure discrimination complaints alleging sexual orientation and gender \nidentity discrimination are processed as complaints of prohibited sex discrimination.”  Q&A, at \n2.  Further, “State Agencies and program operators will need to update their Nondiscrimination \nStatements and order new And Justice for All posters that reference gender identity and sexual \norientation discrimination.”  Id.  The Memoranda did not create these obligations; they are not \nnew. \nThe FNA directs that “[t]he Secretary shall issue such regulations consistent with this \nchapter as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate for the effective and efficient \nadministration of the supplemental nutrition assistance program and shall promulgate all such \nregulations in accordance with the procedures set forth in [the APA].”  7 U.S.C. § 2013(c).  \nPursuant to this statutory authority, the Secretary of USDA, through notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, promulgated the following regulation:   \n(b) Right to file a complaint.  Individuals who believe that they have been subject \nto discrimination as specified in paragraph (a) of this section may file a written \ncomplaint with the Secretary or the Administrator, FNS, Washington, DC \n20250, and/or with the State agency, if the State agency has a system for \nprocessing discrimination complaints.  The State agency shall explain both the \nFNS and, if applicable, the State agency complaint system to each individual who \nexpresses an interest in filing a discrimination complaint and shall advise the \nindividual of the right to file a complaint in either or both systems. . . .  \n20 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 20 of 56   PageID #: 963\n\n \n(f) Public notification.  The State agency shall:  (1) Publicize the procedures \ndescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and, if applicable, the State \nagency’s complaint procedures; (2) insure that all offices involved in \nadministering the program and that also serve the public display the \nnondiscrimination poster provided by FNS; and (3) insure that participants and \nother low-income households have access to information regarding \nnondiscrimination statutes and policies, complaint procedures, and the rights of \nparticipants, within 10 days of the date of a request. \n \n7 C.F.R. § 272.6(b), (f) (emphasis added).  Plaintiff States’ obligations to update their complaint-\nprocessing procedures and public-notification posters to conform to current FNS standards \nderives from this previously promulgated regulation and the authority to promulgate such a rule \nin the FNA.5  The Memoranda do not impose new obligations or command regulated parties—\nthey simply reiterate obligations under preexisting law, both as to their articulation of what Title \nIX and FNA’s sex-discrimination prohibitions protect and as to smaller administrative tasks.  \nAccordingly, the Memoranda are not “final agency action[s]” subject to review under the APA.   \niv.  Plaintiff States lack an adequate alternative remedy through administrative \nreview of an enforcement proceeding under Title IX and FNA because they \nchallenge not only the threat of such future enforcement but also the \nimmediate imposition of compliance costs. \n \nDefendants contend that Section 704 of the APA also precludes review in this case.  \nAgency actions are only reviewable under this provision when “there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  “The essential inquiry is whether another statutory scheme \n \n5 The Court found that Plaintiff States demonstrated standing through their injury-in-fact of \ncompliance costs, which it also found were traceable, in part, to the Memoranda.  See supra \nSection III.A.i.  While the Court now finds the obligations causing those compliance costs derive \nfrom a different, preexisting regulation, the compliance costs are still traceable to the Memo for \nstanding purposes because, but for FNS announcing its updated interpretation of Title IX and \nFNA’s nondiscrimination provisions through the Memoranda, Plaintiff States would not have \nhad to expend the administrative costs of updating websites, posters, brochures, etc.  \n21 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 21 of 56   PageID #: 964\n\nof judicial review exists so as to preclude review under the more general provisions of the APA.” \nBangura v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 487, 501 (6th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).   \nSimilarly, Defendants also contend that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear a \npre-enforcement challenge of USDA’s actions under the Thunder Basin doctrine, because \nCongress intended the extensive administrative-enforcement schemes in Title IX and the FNA to \nbe the exclusive remedies for challenges pursuant to those statutes.  (Doc. 54, at 32–33 (citing \nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 207 (1994).)  Thunder Basin stands for the \nproposition that when a statute provides for “delayed judicial review of final agency actions[]” \nafter an administrative enforcement process, courts “shall find that Congress has allocated initial \nreview to an administrative body where such intent is ‘fairly discernible in the statutory \nscheme.’”  510 U.S. at 207 (quoting Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 351 (1984)).  \n“Whether a statute is intended to preclude initial judicial review is determined from the statute’s \nlanguage, structure, purpose, legislative history, and the opportunity provided for meaningful \nreview of the claims.”  Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Loc. Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. \nSupp. 3d 850, 861 (S.D. Ohio 2016) (citing Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207) [hereinafter \n“Highland”].  At least one other district court within the Sixth Circuit has held that the Thunder \nBasin doctrine precluded a pre-enforcement challenge to administrative actions by the \nDepartment of Education changing its interpretation of how it would enforce Title IX.  Id. at 864.   \nThe alleged injuries in Thunder Basin and Highland, however, consisted only of a threat \nof future enforcement of the statutes at issue against the plaintiffs.  Id.; Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. \nat 204–05.  As the Highland court noted, the administrative actions in that case “impose[d] no \nimmediate penalties for non-compliance[,]” and, therefore, the plaintiffs would have the \n22 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 22 of 56   PageID #: 965\n\nopportunity for review in the administrative enforcement process, which also amounts to an \nadequate alternative remedy, prior to suffering an injury.  208 F. Supp. 3d. at 864.   \nThis case is distinguishable.  While this case contemplates the threat of future \nenforcement of Title IX and/or the FNA, Plaintiff States also allege the immediate injury of \ncompliance costs.  (Doc. 1, at 29.)  This case is not solely a preemptive challenge to a possible \nfuture agency enforcement like Highland and Thunder Basin but also a direct challenge to the \nimposition of new compliance costs through agency actions.  Therefore, even assuming the Title \nIX and FNA enforcement schemes constitute adequate alternative remedies or were intended by \nCongress to be the exclusive enforcement schemes for pre-enforcement challenges, neither \nSection 704 of the APA nor the Thunder Basin doctrine presents obstacles to Plaintiff States’ \nchallenge of the immediate imposition of compliance costs. \nB.  APA Claims \ni.  USDA’s promulgation of the Final Rule complied with the notice-and-\ncomment requirements of the APA because the Final Rule is a logical \noutgrowth of the NPRM.  \n \nPlaintiff States claim that the Final Rule is invalid because it did not comply with the \nprocedural requirements of the APA.6  (Doc. 1, at 30–31.)  “The APA establishes the procedures \nfederal administrative agencies use for ‘rule making,’ defined as the process of ‘formulating, \namending, or repealing a rule.”  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 95 (2015) (quoting \n5 U.S.C. § 551(5)).  A “rule” is defined as a “statement of general or particular applicability and \nfuture effect” that is designed to “implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.”  Id. (quoting \n \n6 Plaintiff States also claim that the Memoranda violated the APA’s procedural requirements, in \naddition to other causes of action under the APA as to the Memoranda.  (Doc. 1, at 29–33, 35–\n36.)  However, in light of the Court’s ruling that the Memoranda were not final agency actions \nsubject to judicial review under the APA, see supra Section III.A.iii, the Court will not consider \nPlaintiff States’ APA claims as they pertain to the Memoranda.  \n23 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 23 of 56   PageID #: 966\n\n5 U.S.C. § 551(4)).  “Rules” issued by agencies without abiding by the APA’s notice-and-\ncomment procedural requirements are invalid.  Tenn. Hosp. Assoc. v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 \n(6th Cir. 2018).   \nThe APA requires that agencies engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking publish a \n“[g]eneral notice of proposed rule making” that must include “either the terms or substance of \nthe proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  The \nSupreme Court has stated that, to satisfy this procedural requirement, the final rule the agency \nadopts “must be a logical outgrowth of the rule proposed.”  Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. \nCoke, 551 U.S. 158, 174 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Nat’l Black Media \nCoal. v. F.C.C., 791 F.2d 1016, 1022 (2d Cir. 1986)).  “The object, in short, is one of fair \nnotice.”  Id.  \nPlaintiff States contend that the inclusion of the clause “including gender identity and \nsexual orientation” in the Final Rule is not a logical outgrowth of the NPRM’s language \nprohibiting discrimination “on the grounds of sex,” and, therefore, the Final Rule is invalid.  \n(Doc. 3, at 18–19; Doc. 78, at 22–24.)  In Bostock, the Supreme Court considered three cases in \nwhich “[a]n employer fired a long-time employee shortly after the employee revealed that he or \nshe is homosexual or transgender.”  140 S. Ct. at 1737.  The Supreme Court described its task in \nthat case:   \nWe must determine the ordinary public meaning of Title VII’s command that it is \n“unlawful . . . for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any \nindividual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his \ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such \nindividual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”   \n \nId. at 1738 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(1)).  To interpret this command, the Supreme Court \napplied Title VII’s contemporaneous meaning of the term “sex”:  “status as either male or female \n24 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 24 of 56   PageID #: 967\n\n[as] determined by reproductive biology.”  Id. at 1739 (alteration in original).  Then, it examined \nthe meaning of the statute’s prohibition on employers taking certain actions “because of” sex: \n[A]s this Court has previously explained, “the ordinary meaning of ‘because of’ is \n‘by reason of’ or ‘on account of.’”  In the language of law, this means that Title \nVII’s “because of ” test incorporates the “‘simple’” and “traditional” standard of \nbut-for causation.  That form of causation is established whenever a particular \noutcome would not have happened “but for” the purported cause.  In other words, \na but-for test directs us to change one thing at a time and see if the outcome \nchanges.  If it does, we have found a but-for cause. \n \nThis can be a sweeping standard.  Often, events have multiple but-for causes.  So, \nfor example, if a car accident occurred both because the defendant ran a red light \nand because the plaintiff failed to signal his turn at the intersection, we might call \neach a but-for cause of the collision.  When it comes to Title VII, the adoption of \nthe traditional but-for causation standard means a defendant cannot avoid liability \njust by citing some other factor that contributed to its challenged employment \ndecision.  So long as the plaintiff’s sex was one but-for cause of that decision, that \nis enough to trigger the law.  \n \nId. (internal citations omitted).  The Bostock Court concluded that the “ordinary public meaning” \nof Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because of sex” in employment decisions inherently \nincludes sexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination “because it is impossible to \ndiscriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating \nagainst that individual based on sex.”  Id. at 1741.   \nSimilar to the Title VII command at issue in Bostock, the language of the NPRM requires \nthat states agree to comply with Title IX and the FNA “to the effect that, no person in the United \nStates shall, on the grounds of sex, race, color, age, political belief, religious creed, disability, or \nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise \nsubject to discrimination under SNAP.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 81,017 (emphasis added) (first citing 20 \nU.S.C. 1681 (“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”) (emphasis added); and then \n25 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 25 of 56   PageID #: 968\n\nciting 7 U.S.C. § 2020 (“In the certification of applicant households for the supplemental \nnutrition assistance program, there shall be no discrimination by reason of race, sex, religious \ncreed, national origin, or political affiliation.”) (emphasis added)).  Just as the Title VII \ncommand at issue in Bostock created a causation standard in which sex need only be a “but-for” \ncause of discrimination, here, the language of the command against discrimination in the NPRM, \nand the incorporation by reference of Title IX and FNA’s commands, also strongly suggests a \nbut-for causation standard.  Comcast Corp. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Afr. Am.-Owned Media, 140 S. Ct. \n1009, 1016 (2020) (reaffirming that a federal remedy against discrimination “on the basis of” \nwas “strongly suggestive” of a but-for causation standard); Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1739 (defining \n“because of” as synonymous with “by reason of”);  American Heritage Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 775 (4th ed. 2006) (defining “ground” as “a basis[, o]ften used in the plural”); see, \ne.g., Rowles v. Curators of Univ. of Mo., 983 F.3d 345, 359 (8th Cir. 2020) (“Title IX is \nunderstood to bar the imposition of university discipline where sex is a motivating factor in the \ndecision to discipline.”) (cleaned up) (quoting Doe v. Columbia Univ., 831 F.3d 46, 53 (2d Cir. \n2016)).  Under the but-for causation standard of the NPRM, “because it is impossible to \ndiscriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating \nagainst that individual based on sex,” a prohibition on gender-identity and sexual-orientation \ndiscrimination is inherent in the language of the NPRM’s command against sex discrimination.  \nSee Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741. \nThe Supreme Court concluded in Bostock that a prohibition against discrimination on the \nbasis of gender identity and sexual orientation was not merely a logical outgrowth of a \nprohibition against discrimination because of sex but inherent in the ordinary public meaning of \nthe language since its inception.  Id.  It would defy this legal analysis for the Court to hold that \n26 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 26 of 56   PageID #: 969\n\nthe inclusion of the clause “including gender identity and sexual orientation” in the Final Rule—\na mere reiteration of what is inherent in the ordinary language of Title IX and the FNA—was not \na “logical outgrowth” of the NPRM’s prohibition on sex discrimination.  The Final Rule was, at \na bare minimum, a logical outgrowth of the NPRM and satisfied the procedural requirements of \nthe APA.   \nii.  USDA did not act arbitrarily and capriciously by not considering Plaintiff \nStates’ interests in sex-separated living facilities, because the Final Rule \ndoes not impact those interests in any way.  \n \nPlaintiff States also claim that the Final Rule should be set aside as “arbitrary and \ncapricious,” pursuant to the APA.  (Doc. 1, at 33–35.)  The APA states that, when reviewing \nagency actions, “[t]he reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  “Under what [the Supreme Court has] \ncalled this ‘narrow’ standard of review, . . . an agency [must] ‘examine the relevant data and \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.’”  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nU.S. 502, 513 (2009) (quoting Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  But “a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the \nagency and should uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may \nreasonably be discerned.”  Id. at 513–14 (cleaned up) (quoting Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.–\nBest Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974)).  The Supreme Court has held “[i]t would be \narbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters[]” as “when [an agency’s] prior policy has \nengendered serious reliance interests.”  Id. at 515–16 (citing Smiley v. Citibank (S.D.), N. A., 517 \nU.S. 735, 742 (1996)).   \n27 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 27 of 56   PageID #: 970\n\nThe Final Rule provides a clear explanation for its action:  \nCodifying civil rights protections is vital to the success of SNAP because it \nsupports the Department in providing equitable and superior customer service to \nall SNAP applicants and recipients.  The protections included in this rule will \nprevent discrimination and systemic racism in the SNAP program that could \nnegatively impact program access and outcomes.  Integrating additional civil \nrights language into the FSA ensures a consistent application of these practices \nacross the program. \n \n87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855.   \nPlaintiff States argue that the Final Rule is nonetheless arbitrary and capricious because \nUSDA “failed to consider the reliance interests associated with banning sex-separated facilities.”  \n(Doc. 78, at 25.)  Despite its express limitation to discrimination “under SNAP,” Plaintiff States \ninsist that the Final Rule’s prohibition against gender-identity and sexual-orientation \ndiscrimination applies at the “institutional level.”  (Id. at 17.)  But the Final Rule says no such \nthing:  “[N]o person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex, including gender identity \nand sexual orientation, race, color, age, political belief, religious creed, disability, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subject to \ndiscrimination under SNAP.”  7 C.F.R. 272.2 (emphasis added).   \nTo detect any language addressing sexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination \nat the “institutional level” requires a journey far outside the Final Rule.  One first must reference \nthe nonbinding Memo, which USDA issued separately from the Final Rule; second, open the \nnonbinding Q&A Document attached to the Memo; third, navigate to a USDA site linked in the \nQ&A document; and fourth, read the nondiscrimination statement that state and local SNAP \nagencies must post, which exists merely to inform the public of their right to file discrimination \n28 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 28 of 56   PageID #: 971\n\ncomplaints.7  Q&A, at 2.  The Public-Notification Statement reads, in part, “this institution is \nprohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including gender \nidentity and sexual orientation), disability, age, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights \nactivity.”  Public-Notification Statement. \nReliance on the Public-Notification Statement as the basis for arguing the Final Rule \nprohibits sex-separated bathrooms in all state-run facilities abandons intellectual honesty.8  Even \n \n7 Plaintiff States brazenly ignore this context.  It seems incredibly unlikely that a member of the \npublic would complete this journey, read a poster in a public-benefits office, or visit a SNAP-\napplication website in search of information about a restroom.  Instead, that citizen almost \ncertainly seeks information about food benefits.  In such a context and with an eye toward \ninforming the public—rather than making a political statement—this language efficiently, even if \nimperfectly, conveys important information consistent with the thrust of the Final Rule and the \ngoverning statute.  There is a reason USDA would not require states to simply post the text of \nTitle IX and the FNA to notify the public of the states’ obligations:  the statutory language is not \neasily digestible for the layperson.  Language in agency brochures, posters, manuals, \ninformational webpages, and the like is nonbinding, see infra, because it would be entirely \nunworkable to demand linguistic perfection, hewing to a robust body of law on textual \ninterpretation, while also informing the public in an accessible way. \n8 Certainly, this case is part of a lineage of cases challenging agency actions that arose from the \nExecutive Order 13,988 review process, and some of those challenges, including another one \nbefore this Court, have been successful on the merits and/or in obtaining a preliminary \ninjunction.  See, e.g., Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450 at *3; Texas v. EEOC, No. 2:21-cv-194, \n2022 WL 4835346 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 1, 2022).  The Court does not cast doubt on those decisions; \nrather, it emphasizes the distinctly imaginative allegations and strained reasoning Plaintiff States \nrely on in this case.   \nIn Tennessee, this Court considered purported guidance documents from the Department of \nEducation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) that were issued in \nlight of Executive Order 13,988.  2022 WL 2791450 at *2–3.  As the Court will discuss in \nfurther detail in Section III.B.iii.b., the guidance documents at issue in Tennessee created \nobligations to allow transgender individuals’ access to the bathrooms and locker rooms of their \nchoice, but Title IX contains a specific carve-out to permit sex-separated living facilities.  Id. at \n*20–22.  In Texas, the Northern District of Texas considered EEOC and HHS guidance that \nimposed obligations on how employers and healthcare providers may treat transgender people \nwith respect to dress codes, bathroom access, use of their preferred pronouns, and receipt of \ngender-affirming care.  Texas, 2022 WL 4835346, at *1–2.  “[T]he crux of the parties’ \ndisagreement distill[ed] down to one question:  is the non-discrimination holding in Bostock \ncabined to ‘homosexuality and transgender status’ or does it extend to correlated conduct — \n \n29 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 29 of 56   PageID #: 972\n\nif a school received SNAP-Ed funding from the state, the school posted the Public-Notification \nStatement on its website, a parent saw it, the family filed a complaint against the school for \npreventing their trans child from using the bathroom of her choice, the state refused to resolve \nthe issue by informal means, and USDA commenced an adjudication, such an adjudication \nwould not be bound in any way by the Public-Notification Statement’s language.  See supra \nIII.A.iii.; 7 C.F.R. § 15.8 (setting forth USDA discrimination-complaint-processing procedures, \nwhich require, first, informal efforts to secure voluntary compliance, then an opportunity for \nhearing, and an express finding on the record).  The Public-Notification Statement is nonbinding; \nit lacks the force of law.  See Christensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (Here, . . . \nwe confront an interpretation contained in an opinion letter, not one arrived at after, for example, \na formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking.

Astrue, \n417 F. App’x 544, 547 (7th Cir. 2011) (“[The plaintiff] contends that . . . the agency violated due \nprocess by ignoring procedures in the ‘Unfair Treatment Complaint’ brochure. . . .

Hansen, 450 U.S. 785, 789 (1981)) (concluding \n \nspecifically, the sex-specific:  (1) dress; (2) bathroom; (3) pronoun; and (4) healthcare practices \nunderlying the Guidances and the Amended Complaint?”  Id. at *2 (emphasis added).  \nThe Final Rule at issue here does not purport to prohibit sex-separated living facilities, as \nspecifically permitted by Title IX, nor does it create or alter states’ obligations related to conduct \nsuch as dress, bathrooms, pronoun use, or healthcare practices.  Rather, it simply prohibits \ndiscrimination under SNAP, “cabined to ‘homosexuality and transgender status.’”  7 C.F.R. § \n272.2 (“[N]o person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex . . . be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subject to discrimination under \nSNAP.”).  \n30 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 30 of 56   PageID #: 973\n\nthat manual rules promulgated for claims representatives do not bind the Social Security \nAdministration).   \nRather, in such an adjudication, USDA would only be substantively bound by the Final \nRule, Title IX, the FNA—all of which clearly limit the discrimination prohibitions to the \nadministration of SNAP and SNAP-Ed.  7 C.F.R. § 272.6 (“State agencies shall not discriminate \nagainst any applicant or participant in any aspect of program administration, including, but not \nlimited to, the certification of households, the issuance of coupons, the conduct of fair hearings, \nor the conduct of any other program service for reasons of age, race, color, sex, disability, \nreligious creed, national origin, or political beliefs.  Discrimination in any aspect of program \nadministration is prohibited by these regulations [and] the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 . . . .”) \n(emphasis added); 7 C.F.R. § 272.2 (“no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex, \nincluding gender identity and sexual orientation, race, color, age, political belief, religious creed, \ndisability, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \notherwise subject to discrimination under SNAP”) (emphasis added); 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1) (“In \nthe certification of applicant households for the supplemental nutrition assistance program, there \nshall be no discrimination by reason of race, sex, religious creed, national origin, or political \naffiliation.”) (emphasis added); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (“No person in the United States shall, on \nthe basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”) \n(emphasis added).  Further, Defendants explicitly acknowledge that neither the Memoranda nor \nthe Final Rule “bear[s] on issues related to ‘maintaining sex separated bathrooms and locker \nrooms, offering sex-separated athletic teams, or using biologically accurate pronouns,’ . . . and \n31 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 31 of 56   PageID #: 974\n\nneither does the FNA.”  (Doc. 54, at 41 (“Plaintiffs have conjured up a fear of their own \nimagining, ignoring the reality of what the May 5 Memo and Final Rule do and do not do.”).)  \nNo matter how many times Plaintiff States insist otherwise, protecting poor people’s \naccess to the benefit of food stamps does nothing to redefine access to a school restroom.  And \nPlaintiff States acknowledge they have no reliance interest that is inconsistent with the actual \neffect of the Final Rule, because they do not “deny SNAP certification of applicant households \nbased on household members’ sexual orientation or gender identity.”  (Doc. 1, at 9.)  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff States have failed to state a claim that the Final Rule should be set aside as \narbitrary and capricious.  \niii.  Title IX and the FNA unambiguously prohibit gender-identity and sexual-\norientation discrimination in the administration of SNAP, so Plaintiff States \nfail to state a claim that the Final Rule is contrary to law under the APA. \n \na.  Statutory language prohibiting discrimination “on the basis of sex” bans \nall discrimination in which sex is a but-for cause, including gender-\nidentity and sexual-orientation discrimination.  \n \nPlaintiff States also claim that the Final Rule’s interpretation of the phrases “on the basis \nof sex” in Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), and “by reason of . . . sex” in the FNA, 7 U.SC. \n§ 2020(c)(1), is contrary to those laws.  (Doc. 1, at 36–37.)  Under the APA, a federal agency \naction is invalid if it is “not in accordance with the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  As the Court \nhas explained, the Supreme Court in Bostock concluded that the “ordinary public meaning” of \nTitle VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because of sex” in employment decisions inherently \nincludes sexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination “because it is impossible to \ndiscriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating \nagainst that individual based on sex.”  140 S. Ct. at 1741; supra Section III.B.iii.  With respect to \nwhether Bostock swept beyond Title VII to other laws that prohibit sex discrimination such as \n32 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 32 of 56   PageID #: 975\n\nTitle IX, the Supreme Court gave the caveat that “none of these other laws are before us; we \nhave not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not \nprejudge any such question today.”  Id. at 1753.  Further, “[u]nder Title VII, too, we do not \npurport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”  Id.  Considering these \ndisclaimers, Bostock is not dispositive of whether Title IX and the FNA are contrary to the Final \nRule’s prohibition on gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination in the administration \nof SNAP.  See id.; see also Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) \n(“Bostock . . . was limited only to Title VII itself.”), cert. denied sub nom. Pelcha v. Watch Hill \nBank, 142 S. Ct. 461 (2021).   But in the absence of any other binding precedent that determines \nthe meaning of sex discrimination under Title IX and the FNA, the reasoning in Bostock \ncertainly informs the Court’s analysis in this case.  See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 \nF.3d 586, 616 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020) (“Although Bostock interprets Title \nVII . . . , it guides our evaluation of claims under Title IX.”) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 141 \nS. Ct. 2878 (2021) (“Although Bostock interprets Title VII . . . , it guides our evaluation of \nclaims under Title IX.”) (citations omitted); see also Smith v. Astrue, 639 F. Supp. 2d 836, 842 \n(W.D. Mich. 2009) (“Non-binding decisions can have great utility when binding decisions on the \ncontested issue are scarce . . . .”). \nFollowing the reasoning in Bostock, the language of the prohibitions on sex \ndiscrimination in Title IX and the FNA supports the notion that the statutes ban discrimination \nagainst an individual that would not have occurred “but for” a person’s sex.  See supra Section \nIII.B.i.  Such prohibitions necessarily prohibit gender-identity discrimination “because the \ndiscriminator is necessarily referring to the individual’s sex to determine incongruence between \n33 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 33 of 56   PageID #: 976\n\nsex and gender, making sex a but-for cause for the discriminator’s actions.”  Grimm, 972 F.3d at \n616 (citing Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741–42).   \nPlaintiff States contend that the phrase “on the basis of sex” in Title IX is substantively \ndistinct from Title VII’s “because of . . . sex” because the use of the definite article “the” in the \nformer phrase “makes clear biological sex must be the sole reason for the discrimination.”9  \n(Doc. 78, at 20 (emphasis added); see Doc. 3, at 25–26.)  While the Court has found Title IX and \nthe FNA incorporate a simple but-for causation standard rather than the “sole basis” standard \nPlaintiff States suggest, supra Section III.B.i., the Final Rule would not be contrary to Title IX \neven under such a “sole basis” standard.  Inherent in Plaintiff States’ argument is the assumption \nthat sex and gender identity are completely separate, distinct reasons for discrimination; as such, \na state should be able to avoid liability for sex discrimination, where sex must be the sole reason \nfor discrimination, by citing an additional reason:  gender identity.  But gender-identity \ndiscrimination and sex discrimination are not distinct reasons for discrimination.  This is the \n \n9 The FNA’s general sex-discrimination prohibition contains no such definite article.  7 U.S.C. \n§ 2020(c)(1) (“In the certification of applicant households for the supplemental nutrition \nassistance program, there shall be no discrimination by reason of . . . sex . . . .”).  A far narrower \nprovision of the FNA states that “the State agency . . . shall be responsible for conducting [SNAP \nadministration on an Indian reservation] unless the Secretary determines that the State agency . . . \nis failing . . . properly to administer such program . . . and further determines that the [tribal \norganization] is capable of effectively and efficiently conducting such program, in light of . . . \nthe adequacy of measures taken by the trial organization to ensure that there shall be no \ndiscrimination in the operation of the program on the basis of . . . sex.”  Id. § 2020(d).  Plaintiff \nStates argue that this narrower provision “indicates ‘on the basis of sex’ is the relevant \nrequirement” by which the Court should analyze FNA’s sex-discrimination prohibition.  (Doc. 3, \nat 16.)  However, the narrower provision plainly is not even a sex-discrimination prohibition but \nrather a criterion by which to measure the capability of a tribal organization to administer its own \nSNAP funds, while the general provision is a binding prohibition against sex discrimination.  See \n7 U.S.C § 2020(c)–(d).  Plaintiff States’ conclusion that the narrower provision is “the relevant \nrequirement” is, frankly, confounding.  Nonetheless, because the Court will conclude that even a \nprohibition against discrimination “on the basis of sex” includes a prohibition against gender-\nidentity and sexual-orientation discrimination, the distinction in the two provisions is inapposite.  \nSee infra Section III.B.iii.a. \n34 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 34 of 56   PageID #: 977\n\nprecise issue that Bostock answered:  “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being \nhomosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”  \nBostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741.   \nJustice Gorsuch’s example from Bostock, substituting SNAP applicants for the example’s \nreferences to employees, illuminates how sex would still be “the basis” of gender-identity \ndiscrimination in the Title IX context.  \nConsider, for example, [a state with two SNAP applicants,] both of whom are \nattracted to men.  The two individuals are, to the [state], materially identical in all \nrespects, except that one is a man and the other a woman.  If the [state denies \nSNAP access to] the male [applicant] for no reason other than the fact he is \nattracted to men, the [state] discriminates against him for traits or actions it \ntolerates in [the] female [applicant]. Put differently, the [state] intentionally \nsingles out an [applicant to deny] based in part on the [applicant’s] sex, and the \naffected [applicant’s] sex is a but-for cause of his discharge.  Or take [a state that \ndenies SNAP access to] a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth \nbut who now identifies as a female.  If the [state approves] an otherwise identical \n[applicant] who was identified as female at birth, the [state] intentionally \npenalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in \nan [applicant] identified as female at birth.  Again, the individual [applicant’s] sex \nplays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the [SNAP-access] decision. \n \nId. at 1741–42.  Just as courts recognize sexual harassment, sex stereotyping, and pregnancy \ndiscrimination as forms of discrimination “on the basis of sex” under Title IX, gender-identity \nand sexual-orientation discrimination are forms of sex discrimination under the statute, too.  See, \ne.g., id.; Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 283 (1998) (“[S]exual harassment \ncan constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX”); Chisholm v. St. Marys City \nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 947 F.3d 342, 351 (6th Cir. 2020) (“Outside of these traditional \napplications of Title VII and Title IX, a plaintiff can also demonstrate sex discrimination by \nshowing that he or she was mistreated for failing to conform to traditional sex stereotypes.”); \nChipman v. Grant Cnty. Sch. Dist., 30 F. Supp. 2d 975, 977 (E.D. Ky. 1998) (“Regulations \npromulgated under Title IX unequivocally apply its prohibition against sex discrimination to \n35 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 35 of 56   PageID #: 978\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy and parental status . . . .”) (citing 34 C.F.R. § \n106.40(a)); Stanford v. Fox Coll., No. 18 C 3703, 2020 WL 814865, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 19, \n2020) (“Discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ includes pregnancy discrimination.”).   \nPlaintiff States urge that, if a state denied an otherwise-qualified individual access to \nSNAP funds because she was transgender, the denial would not violate Title IX or the FNA \nbecause the state primarily penalized her based on her “transgender status,” even though the state \nstill “intentionally penalize[d]” the SNAP applicant because of her sex.  (See Doc. 3, at 16); \nBostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741.  This argument also fails.  First, just as in Title VII cases, federal \ncircuit courts of appeals have uniformly held that an individual’s sex need only be a “motivating \nfactor” of the discrimination in order to constitute discrimination “on the basis of sex” under \nTitle IX.  Columbia Univ., 831 F.3d at 4 53  (“Because Title IX prohibits (under covered \ncircumstances) subjecting a person to discrimination on account of sex, it is understood to ‘bar[ ] \nthe imposition of university discipline where gender is a motivating factor in the decision to \ndiscipline.’”) (citation omitted); Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, 343 (3d Cir. 2022) \n(holding that Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination “on the basis of sex” bars \ndiscrimination “when sex is a motivating factor in the decision”); Doe v. Purdue Univ., 928 F.3d \n652, 667–68 (7th Cir. 2019) (“We see no need to superimpose doctrinal tests on the statute.  All \nof these categories simply describe ways in which a plaintiff might show that sex was a \nmotivating factor in a university’s decision . . . .  We prefer to ask the question more directly:  do \nthe alleged facts, if true, raise a plausible inference that the university discriminated . . . ‘on the \nbasis of sex’?”); Rowles, 983 F.3d at 359 (“Title IX is understood to bar the imposition of \nuniversity discipline where sex is a motivating factor in the decision to discipline.”) (cleaned up) \n(citation omitted); Schwake v. Az. Bd. of Regents, 967 F.3d 940, 946 (9th Cir. 2020) \n36 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 36 of 56   PageID #: 979\n\n(“Title IX bars the imposition of university discipline where gender is a motivating factor in the \ndecision to discipline.”) (internal quotation and citations omitted); Doe v. Univ. of Denver, 1 \nF.4th 822, 830 (10th Cir. 2021) (adopting a motivating-factor standard for Title IX claims); Doe \nv. Samford Univ., 29 F.4th 675 (11th Cir. 2022) (same); Doe v. Trustees of Bos. Coll., 892 F.3d \n67, 90 (1st Cir. 2018) (same).  As such, Title IX prohibits all discrimination where sex is a but-\nfor cause, even if there is another motivating factor.   \nFurther, Plaintiff States’ reading would lead to absurd results.  It would call into question \nthe well-settled law that sexual-harassment, pregnancy, and sex-stereotyping discrimination \nconstitute discrimination “on the basis of sex” under Title IX by enabling litigants to construe \nthese types of discrimination as based primarily on sexual desire, the “status” of pregnancy, or \nthe failure to conform to a preferred stereotype, rather than sex in and of itself.  See, e.g., Gebser, \n524 U.S. at 283; Chisholm, 947 F.3d at 351; Chipman, 30 F. Supp. 2d at 977; Stanford, 2020 WL \n814865, at *6.  Even in the case of classic discrimination “based on sex,” states could escape \nliability under Plaintiff States’ reading.  Consider, for example, a state that decided to deny \nSNAP benefits to all males.  Such a decision would unquestionably violate Title IX and the FNA \nunder the statutes’ but-for causation standards.  But, if the Court accepted the causation standards \nPlaintiff States argue should apply, the state could escape liability for such blatant sex \ndiscrimination by arguing that the sex is not the “sole” reason for its discrimination; rather, \nbecause males generally earn higher incomes than similarly situated females, the state could \nproclaim that it discriminated against the males for their “income-advantaged status.”  Under \nPlaintiff States’ reading, it would not matter that the state could not create such a classification \nwithout referring to sex; the status would be “distinct” from sex, and sex must be the “sole” \nreason for the discrimination.  Circumvention of Congress’s edicts in Title IX and the FNA \n37 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 37 of 56   PageID #: 980\n\nwould require only a bit of crafty framing and wordsmanship.  Congress could not have intended \nsuch a result, so the Court must not accept such a reading.  Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 4, at \n63 (“A textually permissible interpretation that furthers rather than obstructs the document’s \npurpose should be favored.”).   \nBecause Title IX incorporates a but-for, motivating-factor causation standard for sex \ndiscrimination, the same kind of sex-discrimination-causation standard at issue in Bostock, the \nplain text of Title IX’s sex-discrimination prohibition also bars gender-identity and sexual-\norientation discrimination.   \nb.  The entire text and structure of Title IX and FNA support the \ninterpretation of their sex-discrimination prohibitions to ban gender-\nidentity and sexual-orientation discrimination under SNAP.  \n \nWhile the plain texts of Title IX and FNA’s sex-discrimination prohibitions, in a vacuum, \ncover the concepts of gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination, they are not \nconclusive.  The Court must consider the entire text and structure of the statutes, not just the text \nof the nondiscrimination provisions alone.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 18 (1981) (“In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or \nmember of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.”) \n(citations and internal quotation omitted); Regions Bank v. Legal Outsource PA, 936 F.3d 1184, \n1192 (11th Cir. 2019) (“The whole-text canon refers to the principle that a ‘judicial interpreter \n[should] consider the entire text, in view of its structure and of the physical and logical relation \nof its many parts,’ when interpreting any particular part of the text.”) (alteration in original) \n(quoting Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 24, at 167).   \nThe Sixth Circuit, since Bostock, has stated that  \nTitle VII differs from Title IX in important respects:  For example, under Title IX, \nuniversities must consider sex in allocating athletic scholarships, 34 C.F.R. \n38 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 38 of 56   PageID #: 981\n\n§ 106.37(c), and may take it into account in “maintaining separate living facilities \nfor the different sexes.”  20 U.S.C. § 1686.  Thus, it does not follow that \nprinciples announced in the Title VII context automatically apply in the Title IX \ncontext. \n \nMeriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1686; \n34 C.F.R. § 106.37(c) (requiring universities to consider sex in allocating athletic scholarships).  \nSome of the courts that have considered whether the reasoning in Bostock extends to the \nsex-discrimination prohibition in Title IX, including this Court, have found that the provisions of \nTitle IX that expressly allow sex-separated living facilities and sports teams squarely conflict \nwith any reading of the statute that would prohibit such sex separation or consider it to be \ndiscrimination.  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21; Adams by & through Kasper v. Sch. Bd. \nof St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 813 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (“Title IX explicitly provides a \nstatutory carve-out for ‘maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.’  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1686.  So, if ‘sex’ were ambiguous enough to include ‘gender identity,’ . . . then this carve-out, \nas well as the various carveouts under the implementing regulations, would be rendered \nmeaningless.”).  In Tennessee, this Court considered Department of Education (“DOE”) and \nEEOC guidance documents related to its interpretation of Title IX’s sex-discrimination \nprohibition, one of which stated that DOE “can investigate a principal barring a high school \ntransgender girl (i.e., a biological male) from entering the girls’ restroom and a coach turning her \naway from an all-girls sports tryout as unlawful sex discrimination under Title IX.”  2022 WL \n2791450, at *21.  The Court held, based in part on Title IX’s carveout for sex-separated \nfacilities, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the guidance \ndocuments violated the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA because the purported \nguidance altered the rights and obligations from those existing under the text of Title IX.  Id. at \n*21–22.   \n39 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 39 of 56   PageID #: 982\n\nSimilarly, in Adams, the Eleventh Circuit held that, even after Bostock, a school board’s \npolicy separating bathrooms based on biological sex and its directive that a transgender boy must \nnot use the male bathrooms did not violate Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination, because \nthe statute expressly allows sex-separated living facilities.  Adams, 57 F.4th at 811.  Further, the \nTitle IX carveouts at issue in these cases are supported by the Supreme Court’s definition that \n“[t]o ‘discriminate against’ a person[] . . . mean[s] treating that individual worse than others who \nare similarly situated,” because sex-separated living facilities and sports teams do not, in general, \nsubject anyone to a disadvantage.  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1740; see also Transcript of Oral \nArgument at 12–13, Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) (Nos. 17-1618, 17-\n1623,18-107) (counsel for the Department of Justice arguing that sex-separated bathrooms are \n“not discriminatory because” no one is “subjected to a disadvantage”).  Importantly, these cases \nonly considered policies related to sex separation of bathrooms, which fall directly within the \nscope of Title IX’s carveout.  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21; Adams, 57 F.4th at 811.   \n  In this case, by contrast, the Final Rule does not attempt to prohibit sex-separated living \nfacilities.  See supra Section III.B.ii., n.8.  Rather, the Final Rule prohibits sex discrimination, \ninterpreted to include gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination, in the administration \nof SNAP.  87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857.  There is no statutory carveout from the general sex-\ndiscrimination prohibitions in Title IX or the FNA for treating the sexes differently for the \npurposes of administering SNAP, so the Final Rule does not conflict with the statutes on the \nbasis of such a carveout.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2020; 20 U.S.C. § 1681.  Further, if Congress intended \nto carve out gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination as permissible under these \nstatutes, it certainly could have written a provision saying as much, just as it did in 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1686 to permit sex-separated living facilities.  See Scalia & Garner, Reading Law § 27, at 181–\n40 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 40 of 56   PageID #: 983\n\n82 (“For Congress knows—who would not?—how to prevent such [an outcome].  A short \nsentence would have done the trick.  The familiar ‘easy-to-say-so-if-that-is-what-was-meant’ \nrule of statutory interpretation has full force here.  The silence of Congress is strident.”) (quoting \nComm’r of Internal Revenue v. Beck’s Est., 129 F.2d 243, 245 (2d Cir. 1942)); see also 20 \nU.S.C. § 1686 (“Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, nothing \ncontained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving funds under \nthis Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.”). \nAnd gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination under SNAP, unlike sex-\nseparated bathrooms, generally, would subject individuals to disadvantages based on their sex.  \nFor example, if a state denied a household access to SNAP benefits due to a household member’s \ngender identity, it would be subject to a disadvantage, i.e., it would not have access to crucial \nnutrition assistance that its peers could access, and “because the discriminator is necessarily \nreferring to the individual’s sex to determine incongruence between sex and gender, [] sex [is] a \nbut-for cause for the discriminator’s actions.”  Grimm, 972 F.3d at 616 (citing Bostock, 140 S. \nCt. at 1741–42). \nTherefore, considering the plain text of the but-for, motivating-factor causation standard, \nthe inapplicability of any statutory carveouts for differing treatment of the sexes, and that \ndiscrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation in the administration of SNAP \nwould subject individuals to a disadvantage, the Court finds that the Final Rule is consistent with \nTitle IX and the FNA.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss will be GRANTED as to \nPlaintiff States’ contrary-to-law APA claim. \n41 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 41 of 56   PageID #: 984\n\nC.  Constitutional Claims \nPlaintiff States also claim that the Final Rule violates the APA for being contrary to \nseveral constitutional provisions, namely, the spending clause, the First Amendment, the Tenth \nAmendment, the anticommandeering doctrine, separation of powers, and the nondelegation \ndoctrine.  (Doc. 1, at 39–47.)   \ni.  The Final Rule is permissible under the spending clause because Congress \nunambiguously conditioned SNAP funds on states’ agreement not to use the \nfunds to engender gender-identity or sexual-orientation discrimination. \n \nPlaintiff States allege that the Final Rule violates the clear-notice requirement of the \nspending clause by conditioning SNAP funds on a State’s acceptance of a prohibition on sexual-\norientation and gender-identity discrimination without notice.  (Id. at 39–40.)  “Under the \nSpending Clause, ‘Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal \nmoney to the States.’”  Sch. Dist. of Pontiac v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 268 \n(6th Cir. 2009) (quoting Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 \n(2006)); U.S. Const. art.

(cleaned up) (quoting Murphy, 548 \nU.S. at 296).  “States cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are ‘unaware’ or which \nthey are ‘unable to ascertain.’”  Sch. Dist. of Pontiac, 584 F.3d at 268 (cleaned up) (quoting \nArlington, 548 U.S. at 296).  “‘By insisting that Congress speak with a clear voice,’ the Supreme \nCourt enables States ‘to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their \nparticipation.’”  Id.

If the State agency does not correct such failure within that specified period, . . . the \nSecretary shall proceed to withhold from the State such funds authorized under sections 2025(a), \n2025(c), and 2025(g) of this title . . . .”); id. at § 2020(c)(1) (“In the certification of applicant \nhouseholds for the supplemental nutrition assistance program, there shall be no discrimination by \nreason of . . . sex . . . .”); 20 U.S.C. § 1682 (“Compliance with any requirement adopted pursuant \nto this section may be effected [] by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue \nassistance under such program or activity . . . .”); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (“No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance . . . .”); see supra Section III.B. \nIn Bostock, the Supreme Court held that “no ambiguity exists” in Title VII’s prohibition \nagainst discrimination “because of . . . sex” such that the statute is incapable of any interpretation \nthat excludes sexual-orientation and gender-identity employment discrimination from its sex-\ndiscrimination prohibition.  140 S. Ct. at 1749.  “The fact that a statute has been applied in \nsituations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity; instead, it \n43 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 43 of 56   PageID #: 986\n\nsimply demonstrates the breadth of a legislative command.”  Id. (cleaned up) (citations omitted).  \n“And ‘it is ultimately the provisions of’ those legislative commands ‘rather than the principal \nconcerns of our legislators by which we are governed.’”  Id. (citations omitted).   \nThe command that states provide equal access to SNAP funds to transgender and \nhomosexual people is unambiguous in this statutory language and always has been.  When a state \ndenies SNAP access to a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now \nidentifies as a female but approves an otherwise identical applicant who was identified as female \nat birth, the state intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions \nthat it tolerates in an applicant identified as female at birth—that is discrimination “on the basis \nof sex” 10 and “because of . . . sex.”  Id. at 1741–42; 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c).    \nAs such, the statutes plainly convey notice that SNAP funds are conditioned on the states’ \nacceptance of a prohibition against “all forms of discrimination because of sex, however they \nmay manifest themselves or whatever labels might attach to them” in the administration of \nSNAP.  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741.  Therefore, the Court will GRANT Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss with respect to Plaintiff States’ claim that the Final Rule is contrary to the clear-notice \nrequirement of the spending clause.   \nPlaintiff States next allege that the Final Rule also violates the spending clause by using \nthe threat of withholding substantial federal funding to coerce them into adopting USDA’s \npreferred policies.  (Doc. 1, at 39–40.)  “Congress may use its spending power to create \n \n10 Even with the carveouts for sex-separated living facilities and sports teams in Title IX, the \nstatutory command against discrimination “on the basis of sex” is unambiguous at least insofar \nas it applies to the administration of SNAP and SNAP-Ed.  Because the Final Rule only \nconditions funding on nondiscrimination under SNAP, the Court need not reach the question of \nwhether the statute gives clear notice that funds are conditioned on the states’ abstention from \nother forms of sexual-orientation or gender-identity discrimination.   \n44 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 44 of 56   PageID #: 987\n\nincentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies[, b]ut when ‘pressure turns into \ncompulsion,’  the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \nBus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577–78 (2012) [hereinafter “NFIB”] (quoting Steward Mach. Co. \nv. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937)).  “Spending Clause programs do not pose this danger when a \nState has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for \nfederal funds”; therefore, the key inquiry is “whether the financial inducement offered by \nCongress was so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion” or is \n“more than a relatively mild encouragement” and instead is “a gun to the head.”  Id. at 578, 580–\n81 (quoting S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987)).   \nIn NFIB, the Supreme Court considered a spending-clause challenge to the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111–148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010) (the “ACA”).  \nId. at 576–88.  “As originally drafted, the ACA provided substantial federal funds to states to \nexpand their Medicaid programs, but, if states chose not to accept the additional funds, they \nwould not only forgo those funds but lose all existing federal funds as well.”  Tennessee v. U.S. \nDep’t of State, 329 F. Supp. 3d 597, 626 (W.D. Tenn. 2018), aff’d sub nom. on other grounds \nState by & through Tenn. Gen. Assembly v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 931 F.3d 499 (6th Cir. 2019).  \n“In order to receive that funding, States [had to] comply with [new] federal criteria governing \nmatters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost.”  NFIB, 567 U.S. \nat 541–42.  As an additional condition on receipt of the new Medicaid funds, the ACA \n“require[d] state programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 133 \npercent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States [at the time] cover[ed] adults with \nchildren only if their income [was] considerably lower, and [did] not cover childless adults at \nall.”  Id. at 542.   \n45 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 45 of 56   PageID #: 988\n\nA plurality of the Supreme Court in NFIB held that this provision of the ACA was unduly \ncoercive because the conditions did not “govern the use of the funds” but rather took “the form \nof threats to terminate other significant independent grants” if the states did not implement a new \nregulatory system, accepting the federal government’s preferred policies.  Id. at 580, 585.  Thus, \nthe expansion “pass[ed] the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion’” because it was, in \nreality, “a new health care program.”  Id. at 580, 583–84.  The existing Medicaid funds \nthreatened were particularly critical in that, at the time, “[f]ederal funds received through the \nMedicaid program [had] become a substantial part of state budgets, [] constituting over 10 \npercent of most States’ total revenue.”  Id. at 542.  \nUnlike the ACA, the Final Rule does not condition the states’ receipt of federal SNAP \nfunds on their implementation of an entirely new regulatory program; it merely elucidates and \nconfirms the condition against sex discrimination set forth by Congress in the statute’s \nlongstanding language.  See id.; 7 C.F.R. § 272.2.  The Final Rule’s condition—that states agree \nnot to engage in gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination in the administration of \nSNAP—directly governs the use of SNAP funds such that states do not use these federal \nnutrition-assistance funds to engender discrimination.  7 C.F.R. § 272.2.  Indeed, the condition at \nissue here actually requires nothing more than what because Plaintiff States allege they are \nalready doing, not surprisingly, based on longstanding statutory language prohibiting sex \ndiscrimination in making SNAP certification decisions.  (Doc. 1, at 9.)  As a practical matter, a \ncondition on the receipt of federal funds that simply enforces the status quo of nondiscrimination \ncan hardly be said to be “in reality a new program,” a “gun to the head,” or “so coercive as to \npass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’”  NFIB, 567 U.S. at 581–82; Dole, 483 \nU.S. at 211 (quoting Steward Mach., 301 U.S. at 590).  Therefore, the Court will GRANT \n46 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 46 of 56   PageID #: 989\n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss as to Plaintiff States’ claim that the Final Rule was unduly \ncoercive under the spending clause.   \nii.  The Final Rule is permissible under the Tenth Amendment and the \nanticommandeering doctrine because it does not supersede powers \nhistorically reserved to the states or command the states to enact a \nregulatory program.  \n \nPlaintiff States also claim that the Final Rule runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment and the \nanticommandeering doctrine.  (Doc. 1, at 44–45.)  The Tenth Amendment states that “[t]he \npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, \nare reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  U.S. Const. amend. X.  Accordingly, \nwhen Congress legislates in a way that supersedes powers historically reserved to the states, it \nmust make “clear and manifest” its purpose to do so.  See Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 \nU.S. 218, 230 (1947).  Plaintiff States’ contention that the Final Rule runs afoul of this principle \narises from their unfounded fear that the Final Rule impedes on the states’ “management of their \npublic schools” and “risk[s] the entire country as a laboratory for novel social experiments” \nwithout a “clear and manifest” pronouncement from Congress to do so.  (Doc. 3, at 31.)  As the \nCourt has explained, the Final Rule only prohibits sexual-orientation and gender-identity \ndiscrimination in the administration of SNAP; it does not prohibit all such discrimination at the \n“institutional level” as Plaintiff States contend.  See supra Sections III.A.iii, III.B.ii.  The Final \nRule merely conditions the use of federal funds on the states’ agreement that they maintain the \nstatus quo of not using those federal funds to engender discrimination on the basis of sex, see \nsupra Section III.C.i.; it does not supersede powers historically reserved to the states, such as the \nmanagement of public schools, nor does it create “novel social experiments.”  Further, \nCongress’s intent to prohibit sex discrimination under Title IX and the FNA is indeed “clear and \n47 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 47 of 56   PageID #: 990\n\nmanifest” in the plain text of those statutes.  See supra Sections III.B.iii, III.C.i.  Therefore, the \nCourt finds the Final Rule is not contrary to the Tenth Amendment.   \n Under the anticommandeering doctrine, “even where Congress has the authority under \nthe Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts, it lacks the power directly to \ncompel the States to require or prohibit those acts[]” or “command a state government to enact \nstate regulation.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144,166, 178 (1992) (emphasis in \noriginal).  Accordingly, “Congress may not simply ‘commandee[r] the legislative processes of \nthe States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.’”  Id. \nat 161 (alteration in original) (quoting Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass’n, Inc., \n452 U.S. 264, 288 (1981)).  Rather, “[w]here a federal interest is sufficiently strong to cause \nCongress to legislate, it must do so directly; it may not conscript state governments as its \nagents.”  Id. at 178.  However, the Supreme Court clarified that “[t]his is not to say that Congress \nlacks the ability to encourage a State to regulate in a particular way, or that Congress may not \nhold out incentives to the States as a method of influencing a State’s policy choices.”  Id. at 166.  \n“Where the recipient of federal funds is a State, . . . the conditions attached to the funds by \nCongress may influence a State’s legislative choices” without amounting to “commandeering.”  \nId. at 167 (citations omitted).   \nIn this case, the Final Rule’s prohibition against sex discrimination under SNAP is a valid \ncondition on receipt of federal SNAP funds rather than a “command . . . to enact state \nregulation.”  See supra Section III.C.i.  Plaintiff States allege that “[t]he Final Rule commandeers \nPlaintiffs and their employees into enforcing federal policy by threatening Plaintiff States’ SNAP \nfunding.”  (Doc. 1, at 45.)  Even the language of this allegation reveals that the Final Rule does \nnot actually “command”; it merely conditions (or “threaten[s],” as Plaintiff States prefer to say) \n48 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 48 of 56   PageID #: 991\n\nthe states’ receipt of SNAP funding on their agreement not to engender sexual-orientation and \ngender-identity discrimination with those funds.  See New York, 505 U.S. at 167.  While the \nincentive of access to federal nutrition-assistance funds may “influenc[e] a State’s policy \nchoices” to accept the nondiscrimination condition it would not otherwise, the federal \ngovernment did not “command” it to do so.  See id.  Therefore, the Court finds that the Final \nRule is not contrary to the anticommandeering doctrine, and, accordingly, it will GRANT \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss as to Plaintiff States’ Tenth-Amendment and anticommandeering \nclaim.  \niii.  The Final Rule is permissible under the First Amendment because it does \nnot regulate state-employed professors’ speech and because states do not \nhave a cause of action against the federal government to assert religious-\nliberty or free-expression rights. \n \n  Plaintiff States next argue that the Final Rule violates the First Amendment in three ways:  \n(1) by requiring teachers and professors to use a student’s preferred pronouns, (2) by \n“conflict[ing] with religious liberty,” and (3) by forcing the states to express messages they do \nnot want to express.  (Doc. 1, at 42–43; Doc. 3, at 29–31, Doc. 78, at 31–33.)  As an initial \nmatter, the Court once again notes that Final Rule only prohibits sexual-orientation and gender-\nidentity discrimination “under SNAP.”  7 C.F.R. 272.2 (emphasis added); see supra Section \nIII.B.ii.  Therefore, nothing in the Final Rule can be read to impact teachers’ and professors’ \nfree-speech rights because the use of a student’s preferred pronouns is not implicated in the \nadministration of SNAP.  See 7 C.F.R. 272.2; (see generally Doc. 1).   \nNext, with respect to its religious-liberty claim, Plaintiff States only allege that “[t]the \nFinal Rule also conflicts with the First Amendment’s protection of religious liberty[,]” without \nany further detail.  (Doc. 1, at 42.)  While Congress may use its spending power to “further broad \npolicy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient \n49 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 49 of 56   PageID #: 992\n\nwith federal statutory and administrative directives[,] . . . the power may not be used to induce \nthe States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.”  Dole, 483 U.S. at \n206, 210.  “In a case challenging free exercise of religion, a plaintiff must show ‘the coercive \neffect of the enactment as it operates against him in the practice of his religion.’”  Burnett v. \nHall, No. 3:11-0279, 2011 WL 4436515, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 22, 2011) (quoting Sch. Dist. \nof Abington Twp. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 223 (1963), report and recommendation \napproved, No. 3:11-00279, 2011 WL 5102446 (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 27, 2011)).  To satisfy the \npleading standard under Rule 8, a plaintiff must plead “more than an unadorned, the-defendant-\nunlawfully-harmed-me accusation,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, and the Court is not “bound to accept \nas true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,” Papasan, 478 U.S. at 286.  Plaintiff \nStates’ cursory briefing in support of this claim also sheds no light on whether any other factual \nallegations substantiate this claim.  (Doc. 3, at 29 (“Second, the Final Rule and Memoranda also \nconflict with religious liberty. . . .  USDA did not even acknowledge in the Final Rule the \npotential conflict between its interpretation of the statutes and the religious-freedom rights of the \nentities and individuals that the statutes regulate.  That conflict provides an additional reason to \nset aside the unlawful actions.”).)  Plaintiff States’ conclusory allegation is insufficient to support \na claim that the Final Rule is contrary to the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment because \nthey do not allege what “coercive effect,” if any, the States’ compliance with the Final Rule \nwould have on any individual’s “practice of [] religion.”  See Schempp, 374 U.S. at 223.    \nFinally, Plaintiff States argue that because the “Final Rule would force Plaintiffs to post \nposters, rewrite policies, enforce policies, and otherwise engage in actions that express messages \nPlaintiffs do not agree with[,]” it violates the states’ own free-expression rights.  (Doc. 1, at 43.)  \nUnderlying this claim is the legal conclusion that the First Amendment protects a state \n50 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 50 of 56   PageID #: 993\n\ngovernment from any federal interference with the state’s speech.  However, the Sixth Circuit \nrecognizes no such conclusion; rather, “the question of whether a state actor may have some First \nAmendment rights protected from federal action” is “not clearly settled.”  Oakstone Cmty. Sch. v. \nWilliams, 615 F. App’x 284, 289 (6th Cir. 2015) (citations omitted); see also New Mexico v. \nMcAleenan, 450 F. Supp. 3d 1130, 1207–10 (D.N.M. 2020) (“It is an open question whether \nStates and municipalities have First Amendment rights against the United States.”).  The \nSupreme Court has expressly declined to answer this question: \nThe Government [argues that] Government entities [such as States] do not have \nFirst Amendment rights.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic \nNational Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 139 [] (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (“The \nFirst Amendment protects the press from governmental interference; it confers no \nanalogous protection on the government”); id., at 139, n.7 [] (“ ‘The purpose of \nthe First Amendment is to protect private expression’ ” (quoting T. Emerson, The \nSystem of Freedom of Expression 700 (1970))). . . .  We need not decide this \nquestion . . . . \n \nUnited States v. Am. Libr. Ass’n, Inc., 539 U.S. 194, 210–11 (2003).   \n  “The majority of courts that have considered the issue, however, have answered that the \nFirst Amendment works in one direction:  it protects people and private entities, not \ngovernments.”  McAleenan, 450 F. Supp. 3d at 1208 (collecting cases).  “The minority position \nis that, at least in some contexts, it makes functional sense to recognize First Amendment \nprotections for States and municipalities, or at least extend certain First Amendment defenses \nlike those defenses against defamation claims.”  Id.  “At a minimum, there is an absence of the \nFirst Congress’ clear intent to decide this constitutional issue.”  Id. at 1209 (citing David \nFagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 100 NW. U. L. Rev. 1637, 1652 (2006) \n(“The debates over the Bill of Rights provide no direct evidence indicating whether the framers \nintended government speech to be included in the Constitution’s speech protections.”)).   \n51 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 51 of 56   PageID #: 994\n\nIn this case, the Court agrees with the majority position and further notes that, even if it \napplied the minority position, it does not make functional sense in this case to recognize First \nAmendment protections for the states.  “That no federal court has expressly found such a right in \n250 years also indicates that the First Congress did not intend for the First Amendment to be read \nso broadly,” and, if this Court were to expressly find such a right here, it would represent an \nunprecedented deviation from those 250 years of jurisprudence.  See id.  “Instead, the \nConstitution, and its State counterparts, act as a whole to limit governmental powers.  The \nConstitution, accordingly, already binds the federal government in myriad ways.”  Id. at 1210.  \nParticularly relevant here are the Tenth Amendment and the spending clause.  As the Court has \nfound, the Final Rule does not run afoul of these limits on the federal government’s powers.  See \nsupra Sections III.C.i.–ii.  If the Court found that it violated states’ free-expression rights to \ncondition the receipt on federal funds on states engaging in any expressive conduct, such as \ndisplaying a poster, Congress’s power under the spending clause would be completely gutted.  \n“Further, recognizing governmental First Amendment protections would muddle the bulk of First \nAmendment caselaw that provides that individual speech trumps the government’s speech.”  \nMcAleenan, 450 F. Supp. 3d at 1210 (citing Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977)).  For \nexample, in the context of compelled association, “[d]issenters would be hard-pressed to avoid \nsuch compelled association were their governments endowed with constitutional rights to \nexpress majority opinion[]” because “[w]hen government stifles or regulates individual speech, \nthe government engages in speech; by suppressing one view, it necessarily expresses a contrary \nview.”  Id.   \n“In short, extending First Amendment protections to governments flips the Constitution \non its head.  Rights belong to people, whereas governments have powers.  Instead of protecting \n52 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 52 of 56   PageID #: 995\n\nindividual liberty at government's expense, a First Amendment cause of action for government \nwould protect government's powers at the expense of individual liberty.”  Id.  Therefore, the \nCourt will not stake out the novel and constitutionally dangerous position in this case that the \nstates enjoy their own First-Amendment protections.  Accordingly, the Court will GRANT \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiff States’ First-Amendment claim.  \niv.  The Final Rule does not run afoul of separation of powers or the \nnondelegation doctrine, because Title IX and the FNA set forth clear \ninstructions to condition SNAP funds on states agreeing not to use the \nfunds to engender sexual-orientation or gender-identity discrimination.   \n \nPlaintiff States’ final constitutional claim turns on the allegation that the Final Rule “is so \nremoved from any reasonable reading of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act that it amounts \nto an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power.”  (Doc. 1, at 47.)  “[A] statutory delegation \nis constitutional as long as Congress ‘lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to \nwhich the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to \nconform.’”  Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019) (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989)).  “[T]he answer requires \nconstruing the challenged statute to figure out what task it delegates and what instructions it \nprovides.”  Id. (citations omitted).  Additionally, courts “expect Congress to speak clearly when \nauthorizing an agency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.”  Ala. \nAss’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (citations and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  In such “extraordinary cases,” “the ‘history and the breadth of \nthe authority that [the agency] has asserted,’ and the ‘economic and political significance’ of that \nassertion, provide a ‘reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress’ meant to confer such \n53 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 53 of 56   PageID #: 996\n\nauthority.”  W. Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2608 (2022) (alteration in original) (quoting \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 159–60 (2000)). \nIn this case, the Final Rule does not run afoul of either of these standards.  As the Court \nhas found, a plain reading of the but-for, motivating-factor causation standards in Title IX and \nthe FNA supports the notion that the statutes prohibit gender-identity and sexual-orientation \ndiscrimination in the context of SNAP administration.  See supra Sections III.B.i, III.B.iii.  \nTherefore, the “instructions” the statutes provide plainly support the interpretation in the Final \nRule.  See Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2123.  Further, the Final Rule does not “exercise powers of vast \neconomic and political significance.”  See Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489.  Instead, it \nmerely requires states to agree to maintain the status quo of nondiscrimination in the \nadministration of SNAP.  See supra Section III.C.i.  Accordingly, the Court will also GRANT \nDefendant’s motion to dismiss (Doc. 70) as to Plaintiff States’ separation-of-powers and \nnondelegation-doctrine claim.   \nIV.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ANALYSIS \n \nThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is “merely to preserve the relative positions of \nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be held.”  Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 \n(1981).  When reviewing motions for preliminary injunctions, Courts must balance the following \nfactors:  (1) the movant’s likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant will suffer \nirreparable injury without an injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction would cause \nsubstantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by granting the \ninjunction.  McNeilly v. Land, 684 F.3d 611, 615 (6th Cir. 2012).  “Although no one factor is \ncontrolling, a finding that there is simply no likelihood of success on the merits is usually fatal.”  \nGonzales v. Nat’l Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 225 F.3d 620, 625 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing Mich. State \n54 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 54 of 56   PageID #: 997\n\nAFL–CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1249 (6th Cir. 1997); see Mich. State AFL-CIO, 103 F.3d at \n1249) (“While, as a general matter, none of these four factors are given controlling weight, a \npreliminary injunction issued where there is simply no likelihood of success on the merits must \nbe reversed.”)); Monsanto Co. v. Manning, 841 F.2d 1126 (6th Cir. 1988) (unpublished table \ndecision) (citing Centurion Reinsurance Co. v. Singer, 810 F.2d 140, 145 (7th Cir. 1987)) (“No \nmatter how strongly the balance of irreparable harms may include in favor of the party asking for \na preliminary injunction, it is error to grant the injunction if the party has no chance or a very \nslight chance of prevailing on the merits.”). \nAs a result of the Court’s analysis on Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Court will \ndismiss all of Plaintiff States’ claims on their merits.  Therefore, there is no likelihood of success \non the merits.  Accordingly, the Court need not engage with the remaining preliminary-\ninjunction factors and, instead, must DENY Plaintiff States’ motion for a preliminary injunction \n(Doc. 2).  See Gonzales, 225 F.3d at 625. \nV.  CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss (Doc. 70) is GRANTED, and \nPlaintiff States’ motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 2) is DENIED.  This case is about food \nstamps and nutrition education, not bathrooms, sports teams, free speech, or religious exercise.  \nOther cases have necessarily examined LGBTQIA+ individuals’ interests in nondiscrimination \njuxtaposed with others’ interests relating to restrooms, sports teams, free speech, or religious \nexercise.  See supra n.8.  But this case entails none of those latter interests; it is about whether, in \nadministering food benefits, Plaintiff States can ignore a federal statute and discriminate against \npoor people who do not to conform to traditional conceptions of sex.  Plaintiff States’ insistence \n55 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 82   Filed 03/29/23   Page 55 of 56   PageID #: 998\n\nto the contrary is no more than an invitation to join a political discussion untethered to applicable \nstatutes and precedent.  The Court will, instead, simply apply the law.  \nThe Court’s task was to determine whether Title IX and the FNA protect LGBTQIA+ \npeople’s access to federally funded food-assistance benefits and nutrition education.  And the \nanswer is clear:  states cannot discriminate based on gender identity and sexual orientation in the \nadministration of SNAP and SNAP-Ed.  While Plaintiff States’ claims were unsuccessful, their \nostensible fears should be assuaged by the fact that the status quo—states providing their low-\nincome families equal access to federal food-assistance funds—shall persist.   \nAN APPROPRIATE JUDGMENT WILL ENTER.    \n            /s/ Travis R.

Poplin \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF  )   \nAGRICULTURE, et al.,   ) \n  ) \nDefendants.  ) \n) \n \n \nORDER \n \n \nBefore the Court is Plaintiff States’1 motion for preliminary injunction and request for \nexpedited hearing thereon (Doc. 2).  Plaintiff States seek to enjoin Defendant United States \nDepartment of Agriculture (“USDA”) from enforcing a policy prohibiting discrimination based \non gender identity and sexual orientation in certain contexts.  Plaintiff States requested that the \nCourt enter an order requiring Defendants to file a response to the motion for preliminary \ninjunction by August 2, 2022, requesting Plaintiff States to file a reply by August 5, 2022, and \nsetting a hearing during the week of August 8, 2022.  (Id. at 4.)  The basis for the request to \nexpedite the hearing is Plaintiff States’ contention that Defendant USDA requires the states to \nagree not to engage in gender-identity or sexual-orientation discrimination for purposes of \nadministering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”) by August 15, 2022, or \nrisk losing millions of dollars of federal SNAP funding.  \n \n1 Plaintiff States are Tennessee, Indiana, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South \nCarolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.  (Doc. 1, at 1.) \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 33   Filed 08/10/22   Page 1 of 5   PageID #: 254\n\nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe preliminary injunction seeks to enjoin USDA from enforcing both a memorandum \nand a final rule addressing discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.  (Doc. \n3, at 11–16.)   \nThe USDA memorandum (“the Memo”) announces the agency’s interpretation of \nprohibitions on sex discrimination contained in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (“FNA”) and \nin Title IX on the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”).  (Doc. 1-1.)  Title IX provides \nthat “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).   The FNA provides, “[i]n the \ncertification of applicant households for the supplemental nutrition assistance program, there \nshall be no discrimination by reason of race, sex, religious creed, national origin, or political \naffiliation.”  7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1).  USDA interprets these prohibitions as coterminous with the \nTitle VII prohibition against sex discrimination and, relying on Bostock v. Clayton County, \nGeorgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), concludes that Title IX and the FNA also prohibit \ndiscrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.  (Doc. 1-1.)   \nThe challenged final rule (the “Rule”), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:  \nCivil Rights Update to the Federal-State Agreement, 87 Federal Register 35,855 (June 14, 2022) \n(to be codified at 7 C.F.R. 272), updates SNAP civil-rights-assurance template language for the \nFederal State Agreements (“FSAs”).  “The FSA is the legal agreement between the [USDA] and \nthe State agency by which the State elects to operate SNAP doing so in accordance with the \n[FNA], SNAP regulations, the State Plan of Operation (State Plan), civil rights laws, and civil \nrights regulations.”  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:  Civil Rights Update to the \n2 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 33   Filed 08/10/22   Page 2 of 5   PageID #: 255\n\nFederal-State Agreement, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855.  The Rule requires that states’ FSAs include \nthe following language:   \nThe State agrees to:  . . . 2. Assurance of Civil Rights Compliance:  Comply with \n. . .  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), [and] \nsection 11(c) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2020), \n. . . to the effect that, no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex, \nincluding gender identity and sexual orientation . . . be excluded from participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subject to discrimination under \nSNAP. \n \nId. at 35,857.  USDA requires Plaintiff States to execute such FSAs by August 15, 2022.  (Doc. \n1, at 25 (citing FY 2023 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education Plan Guidance, \nU.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, at 77, 159 (May 10, 2022), \nhttps://bit.ly/3IJLWWu).) \nPlaintiff States seek to enjoin the enforcement of the Memo and Rule, asserting:  (1) \nUSDA failed to satisfy the Administrative Procedure Act’s procedural requirements to \npromulgate the Memo and Rule, (2) the interpretation of sex discrimination contradicts the \nlanguage of Title IX and the FNA, and (3) the Memo and Rule violate the U.S. Constitution.  \n(Doc. 3, and 18–24.)  They contend that a preliminary injunction is justified because they will \nface irreparable harm through the infringement on their sovereign powers to enact and enforce \nstate laws.  These state laws relate to maintaining sex-separated restrooms and sports teams in \nschools, preserving religious freedom, and protecting state-college faculty’s free-speech rights to \nchoose the pronouns by which they choose to refer to students.  (Doc. 1, at 26–28; Doc. 3, at 33–\n34.) \nII.  ANALYSIS \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(1), the “court may issue a preliminary \ninjunction only on notice to the adverse party.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(1).  “Rule 65’s notice \n3 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 33   Filed 08/10/22   Page 3 of 5   PageID #: 256\n\nrequirement ‘implies a hearing in which the defendant is given a fair opportunity to oppose the \napplication and to prepare for such opposition.’”  L.A. Ins. Agency Franchising, LLC v. Kutob, \nNo. 2:18-CV-12310, 2018 WL 8806102, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 19, 2018) (quoting Hunter v. \nHamilton Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 635 F.3d 219, 246 (6th Cir. 2011)).  Based on the Court’s \nreview of the docket, to date, Plaintiff States have not served Defendants, and the Court has \nreceived no indication that Defendants have received notice.  The Court will not hold a \npreliminary-injunction hearing until Defendants have received notice of Plaintiffs’ request and \nhave had a fair opportunity to oppose the application.   \nNotwithstanding the notice issue, Plaintiff States have not shown good cause for an \nexpedited hearing.  They represent that good cause exists because USDA requires them to adopt \nthe Rule’s required language no later than August 15, 2022.2  That is, Plaintiff States must agree \nin their FSAs that no person “on the grounds of sex, including gender identity and sexual \norientation . . . be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise \nsubject to discrimination under SNAP.”  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Civil \nRights Update to the Federal-State Agreement, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857.  Yet Plaintiff States \nrepeatedly and clearly state that they “do not deny benefits based on a household member’s \nsexual orientation or gender identity” for purposes of administering SNAP benefits.  (Doc. 3, at \n10, 17.)  While Plaintiff States’ briefing certainly identifies a general clash of competing cultural \nnorms between agency policies and state laws, it does not explain how incorporating the Rule’s \nlanguage, regarding only SNAP benefits, would impact their state laws regarding sports \nparticipation, restroom use, religious freedom, or free speech.  Therefore, Plaintiff States have \n \n2 Plaintiff States do not rely on the Memo as cause for an expedited, no-notice hearing.  \n4 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 33   Filed 08/10/22   Page 4 of 5   PageID #: 257\n\nnot demonstrated that it is necessary to hold a preliminary-injunction hearing prior to the states’ \nAugust 15 deadline and before notice to Defendants.   \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court DENIES the Plaintiff States’ request for an expedited \nhearing.  After the record reflects that Defendants have received notice of the motion for \npreliminary injunction, the Court will set a hearing for a date providing Defendants a fair \nopportunity to oppose the application for preliminary injunction, as Rule 65 requires.   \nSO ORDERED.       \n            /s/ Travis R.

Inj. at 1, ECF No. 3 (“Br.”).  Nor is USDA \nimposing new requirements on “elementary school classrooms and bathrooms.”  Id.  USDA has \nmerely issued interpretive documents, related to food and nutrition assistance programs, that remind \nstakeholders of the meaning of sex discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972 (“Title IX”) and the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (“FNA” or the “Act”).  Both laws prohibit \nsex discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  They use slightly \ndifferent words to do so:  Title IX prohibits such discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a), and the FNA prohibits discrimination “by reason of . . . sex,” 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1).  Both \nformulations are substantively indistinguishable from the language of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964, which prohibits discrimination “because of” an individual’s sex, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).  In \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), the Supreme Court found that Title VII unambiguously \nprecludes employers from firing someone “simply for being [gay] or transgender.”  Id. at 1737.  The \nSupreme Court’s reasoning also governs the nearly identical text in Title IX and the FNA. \nOn May 5 and June 14, 2022, USDA issued documents interpreting the requirements of Title \nIX and the FNA for state agencies and operators of programs or activities that receive federal financial \nassistance  from  the  USDA’s  Food  and  Nutrition  Services  (“FNS”),  which  administers  the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”) and a related grant program, SNAP-Education \n(“SNAP-Ed”).  Specifically, on May 5, 2022, USDA issued a document explaining to Regional and \nState Directors of FNS Programs that “the certification of applicant households for SNAP shall be \nconducted without discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.”  See Compl., \nEx. A at 3, ECF No. 1-1 (“May 5 Memo.”).  The May 5 Memo advised state agencies and program \noperators to ensure that complaints “alleging discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual \n1 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 12 of 51   PageID #: 332\n\n \norientation are processed and evaluated as complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Id.  On \nJune 14, 2022, USDA published a rule updating language used in the legal agreements between USDA \nand state SNAP administrators to reflect, as pertinent here, the civil rights requirements of Title IX \nand the FNA, as interpreted by the agency.  87 Fed. Reg. 35,855 (2022) (“Final Rule”).   \nDespite Plaintiffs’ explicit assurances that they do not “deny benefits based on a household \nmember’s sexual orientation or gender identity,” Compl. ¶ 12, ECF No.1; see also id. ¶ 40, and Br. at 1, \n17, Plaintiffs claim that the Final Rule and May 5 Memo will irreparably harm them by forcing them \nto choose “between their sovereignty,” and “education and lunch money for children.”  Br. at 24.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the documents are procedurally defective, arbitrary and capricious, and contrary \nto law, but they are unlikely to succeed on those claims and cannot meet the other preliminary \ninjunction factors.   \nAt the outset, Plaintiffs cannot show that the Court has jurisdiction over their claims.  First, \nPlaintiffs lack standing.  They do not plausibly allege any pending or foreseeable enforcement action \nby USDA, and they fail to plausibly allege the sort of harms that would afford them standing to bring \na claim for pre-enforcement review.  Indeed, the harms Plaintiffs allege to their sovereignty and \nfunding streams from USDA are either not ripe, not traceable to USDA action, or not redressable by \nthis Court.  Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege that their state laws conflict with the challenged documents, \nand no such injury would be traceable to USDA or redressable by the relief Plaintiffs expressly seek, \nbecause Title IX and the FNA, not the Final Rule or May 5 Memo, are the source of the prohibitions \non sex discrimination.  Further, Plaintiffs are not in imminent danger of losing SNAP or SNAP-Ed \nfunds; fourteen of the Plaintiff-States have already entered into new SNAP agreements with the \nupdated non-discrimination language, no State alleges that it will refuse to enter into such an \nagreement, and only one has even proposed alternative language.  Also, no State refused to abide by \nSNAP-Ed’s requirements, nor has any State been denied SNAP-Ed funds.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ concern \n2 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 13 of 51   PageID #: 333\n\n \nthat the May 5 Memo or Final Rule will trigger enforcement action by the U.S. Department of \nEducation is speculative. \n  The Court also lacks jurisdiction because Plaintiffs could bring these claims as defenses in \nany  enforcement  action,  and  because  both  Title  IX  and  the  FNA  provide  a  comprehensive \nenforcement scheme that precludes district court jurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges to \nUSDA’s interpretation of those statutes under the doctrine set forth in Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, \n510 U.S. 200, 215-16 (1994).  \nEven if Plaintiffs could surmount these threshold obstacles, they are not likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their claims.  The May 5 Memo does not constitute final agency action reviewable under \nthe Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”); it is an interpretive rule not subject to the APA’s notice \nand comment requirements.  The Final Rule was promulgated consistent with the APA’s notice and \ncomment requirements.  Neither the Final Rule nor the May 5 Memo are arbitrary and capricious or \ncontrary to law; Defendants’ interpretations hew closely to the reasoning of the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Bostock, and Plaintiffs’ attempts to distinguish the texts of Title VII, Title IX, and the FNA \nare unavailing.  In addition, the challenged documents do not violate the Spending Clause, the First \nAmendment, the Tenth Amendment, the anticommandeering doctrine, the separation of powers \nprinciple/major questions doctrine, or the nondelegation doctrine.   \nFinally, the balance of the equities and public interest militate against a preliminary injunction.  \nThe primary intent of the May 5 Memo and the Final Rule is to protect individuals eligible for USDA-\nfunded programs like SNAP and SNAP-Ed from being denied access to those programs because of \ntheir gender identity and sexual orientation.  The States disavow engaging in such discrimination in \nthe administration of those programs.  The equities and public interest weigh heavily in favor of the \ngovernment’s ability to protect vulnerable populations pursuant to its statutory authority under civil \nrights laws.  For these reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n3 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 14 of 51   PageID #: 334\n\n \nBACKGROUND \nI.  USDA’S FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE AND ITS ADMINISTRATION OF \nSNAP AND SNAP-ED \n \nUSDA’s FNS administers the nutrition assistance programs of USDA.  Decl. of Angela Kline \n¶ 4 (“Kline Decl.”), attached hereto as Ex. A.  FNS’s mission is to provide children and needy families \nbetter  access  to  food  and  a  more  healthful  diet  through  its  food  assistance  programs  and \ncomprehensive nutrition education efforts.  Id.  The largest nutrition assistance program FNS \nadministers is SNAP, id. ¶ 5, whose mission is “to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s \npopulation by raising the levels of nutrition among low-income households.” 7 U.S.C. § 2011.  SNAP \nbenefits increase the food purchasing power of eligible households by supplementing the funds those \nhouseholds have to spend on food.  Kline Decl. ¶ 5 (citing 7 U.S.C. § 2013).   \nCongress limited participation in the SNAP program to “those households whose incomes \nand other financial resources . . . are determined to be a substantial limiting factor in permitting them \nto obtain a more nutritious diet.”  7 U.S.C. § 2014(a).  Congress required the Secretary of Agriculture \nto establish “uniform national standards of eligibility.”  Id. § 2014(b).  The Secretary issued regulations \nestablishing  eligibility  standards  based  on  household  income  and  assets,  see  7  C.F.R.  Part  273 \n(standards); none included sex-based considerations, and “no State agency [may] impose any other \nstandards of eligibility as a condition for participating in the program,” 7 U.S.C. § 2014(b), including \nstandards of eligibility related to sexual orientation or gender identity.   \nThe SNAP program provides low-income households with federal funds to purchase food \nfrom authorized retailers (e.g., grocery stores).  Kline Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7.  Schools do not meet the FNA’s \nstatutory definition of “retail food store[s],” and do not participate in SNAP as authorized retailers.  \nId. ¶ 7.  Nor do meals provided in school cafeterias constitute eligible food for purposes of SNAP.  Id. \n(citing 7 U.S.C. § 2012(k)).  FNS also administers SNAP-Ed, a much smaller program which provides \nnutrition education in a wide variety of settings and for diverse audiences.  See id. ¶ 9.  Unlike the main \n4 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 15 of 51   PageID #: 335\n\n \nSNAP program, SNAP-Ed is a grant program and does not distribute funds or other direct benefits.  \nId. ¶ 9.  Although schools may be implementing agencies or sites for the SNAP-Ed program, FNS’s \nfocus in relation to the program is limited strictly to its nutrition and education purposes and to \nensuring that eligible individuals have access to the program.  Id.  Neither SNAP nor SNAP-Ed \nconcern or otherwise relate to policy concerning the regulation of bathrooms, locker rooms, athletics, \ndress codes, or other areas identified in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  Id. ¶¶ 8-9. \nAlthough USDA funds and oversees SNAP, it is administered through USDA’s partnership \nwith state agencies.  Id. ¶ 6.  To participate in SNAP, state agencies must submit a State Plan of \nOperation, which includes the Federal/State Agreement (“FSA”), the Budget Projection Statement, \nand the Program Activity Statement.  Id. ¶ 10.  The FSA is the legal agreement through which states \nagree to administer SNAP in accordance with the FNA, the Act’s associated regulations, and the FNS-\napproved State Plan of Operation.  Id. ¶ 11 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 272(a)(2)).1  The FSA contains standard \nnondiscrimination language set forth by regulation, see 7 C.F.R. § 272(b)(1), but a State may “propose \nalternative language to any or all the provisions.”  Id. § 272(b)(2); see also Kline Decl. ¶ 14.  Any \nproposed alternative language must be approved by both parties before execution.  Id. \nII.  USDA  UPDATES  ITS  STANDARD  SNAP  FSA  LANGUAGE  BASED  ON \nBOSTOCK IN ITS FINAL RULE \nFrom time to time, USDA has updated the standard SNAP FSA language.  USDA began that \nprocess in late 2016 by publishing a proposed rule in the Federal Register.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 81,015-01 \n(Nov. 17, 2016) (“Proposed Rule”).  Among other topics, the Proposed Rule addressed the standard \nSNAP FSA non-discrimination language.  Id.  USDA proposed modifying the standard language to \n“incorporate references to additional civil rights legislation,” id. at 81,015, including references to Title \n \n1 State agencies wishing to participate in SNAP-Ed must include a Nutrition Education Plan to FNS \nby August 15 if they wish to participate in SNAP-Ed in the next federal fiscal year.  Kline Decl. ¶ 10. \n \n5 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 16 of 51   PageID #: 336\n\n \nIX, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and certain parts of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, among others.  This change was intended only to “codify protections already required by Federal \nlaw, regulations and existing policy.” Id.  \nFollowing the comment period, USDA published its Final Rule on June 14, 2022.  87 Fed. \nReg. 35,855.  Under the Final Rule, the updated SNAP FSA non-discrimination language includes a \nreference to additional civil rights legislation, including an assurance that a state receiving SNAP funds \nwould comply with Title IX.  87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855, 35,857.  Moreover, although past FSA non-\ndiscrimination assurances had long prohibited states from discriminating against SNAP beneficiaries \non the basis of sex, the new language explicitly included “gender identity and sexual orientation” as \nforms of sex discrimination.  Id. at 35,857.  USDA stated that the updated non-discrimination language \nwas intended to “codify protections already required by Federal law and existing policy.”  Id. at 35,855.  \nFurther, states retained the option, “[i]f [they did] . . . not wish to sign the FSA with the language as \nwritten in 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b)(1),” to “‘propose alternative language to any or all the provisions.’”  \nKline Decl. ¶ 14 (quoting 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b)(2)).  USDA and the state must agree in writing on any \nalternative language.  87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857. \nThe Final Rule became effective as of August 15, 2022, and provided, consistent with 7 C.F.R. \n§ 272.2(e)(1), that each participating state must sign and submit a new SNAP FSA to FNS within 120 \ndays after the publication of the regulations in final form.  Kline Decl. ¶ 13.  This means that states \nmust submit their new signed FSA to FNS by December 15, 2022.   Id.  Once signed, the SNAP FSA \nis valid until terminated.  Id.  In the interim, the state’s currently effective FSAs remain in place, \nmeaning it can continue to participate in SNAP until the deadline for the new FSA.  Id. \nAs of September 8, 2022, fourteen Plaintiff-States (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, \nKansas, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and West \nVirginia) have finalized their new SNAP FSA, adopting the exact language promulgated in the Final \n6 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 17 of 51   PageID #: 337\n\n \nRule.  Id. ¶ 15 & Exs. 2-15.  Of the remaining eight other Plaintiff-States, three (Alabama, Indiana, \nand Virginia) have indicated that they expect to submit their SNAP FSAs by December 13, 2022, and \none (Mississippi) has proposed alternative language for FNS to consider.  Id.  The other four states \n(Kentucky, Missouri, South Dakota, and Texas) have not indicated what they plan to do.  Id.  State \nagencies wishing to participate in SNAP-Ed were required to submit their State Plans of Operation \nby August 15.  Kline Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. 1.  All the Plaintiffs-States did so, and all have been allocated \nSNAP-Ed funds for Federal Fiscal Year 2023.  Id.   \nIII.  USDA’S  ENFORCEMENT  OF  VIOLATIONS  OF  SNAP  FSAs  AND  NON- \nDISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS OF TITLE IX AND THE FNA \n \nA.  Enforcement of Violations of SNAP FSAs \n \nIn the hypothetical event that a state agency was to violate one of the assurances in its SNAP \nFSA, there are numerous steps that would need to occur before a suspension and/or disallowance \naction could be taken under the FNA.  See 7 U.S.C. §§ 2020(g), 2023; 7 C.F.R. §§ 276.4, 276.7; Kline \nDecl. ¶ 17.  The state agency would receive written advance notice of a potential action that provides \na time period in which to remedy the deficiency in a state’s administration of SNAP.  Kline Decl. ¶ 17 \n(citing 7 C.F.R. § 276.4(d)(1)).  Failure to remedy the deficiency within the prescribed timeframe would \nresult in a formal warning about a possible suspension and/or disallowance action.  Id. (citing 7 C.F.R. \n§ 276.4(d)(2)).  The state agency would then have thirty days to submit either (a) evidence that it had \nactually complied with the FSA or (b) a corrective action plan laying out how and when the agency \ncould bring itself into compliance.  Id. (citing 7 C.F.R. § 276.4(d)(2)).  A state agency’s SNAP funds \nmay be suspended or disallowed only if it fails to respond to the formal complaint, submits insufficient \nevidence of compliance or an unsatisfactory corrective action plan, or violates an agreed-upon \ncorrective action.  Id. (citing 7 C.F.R. § 276.4(e).  A disallowance of SNAP funds may be appealed to \n7 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 18 of 51   PageID #: 338\n\n \nthe SNAP Appeals Board, and the Board’s decision is subject to judicial review.  Id. ¶ 18 (citing 7 \nC.F.R. § 276.7). \nThe Final Rule did not change anything with regard to the manner in which FNS can enforce \na prohibition against sex discrimination in SNAP or SNAP-Ed.  States were prohibited from \nconsidering a person’s gender identity or sexual orientation for purposes of SNAP and SNAP-Ed \neligibility and participation even before the Final Rule was adopted.  See 7 C.F.R. Part 273; 7 U.S.C. \n§ 2014(b).  Thus, regardless of the Final Rule, FNS can pursue the suspension and/or disallowance of \nFederal funds pursuant to 7 U.S.C. §§ 2020, 2023, 7 C.F.R. § 276.4(b), (c) as to discriminatory conduct \nbased on a person’s gender identity or sexual orientation.  Kline Decl. ¶ 16.  \nB.  Civil Rights Enforcement - The May 5 Memo and Related Documents \nIn addition to its SNAP-specific nondiscrimination enforcement mechanisms under the FNA, \nUSDA also may pursue remedies for violations of specific civil rights laws in programs or activities \nreceiving USDA funds.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1682-1683; 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; see also Decl. of Roberto \nContreras ¶¶ 12-29 (“Contreras Decl.”), attached hereto as Ex. B.  When USDA receives a complaint \nof a violation of civil rights laws in a program or activity receiving USDA funds and determines that \nit has jurisdiction, it notifies the complainant that USDA has accepted the complaint.  Contreras Decl. \n¶¶ 16-20.  At that point, USDA “attempts to resolve the complaint at the lowest possible level through \nalternative dispute resolution.”  Id. ¶ 22.   \nIn the event those attempts are unsuccessful, USDA will assign an investigator, who will \ncompile sworn statements and documents relating to the issues in the complaint.  Id.  Based on the \ninvestigation, USDA decides whether the recipient of federal funds has failed to comply with its civil \nrights obligations.  Id.  If the recipient is found to be out of compliance, USDA will seek voluntary \ncompliance.  Id. ¶ 24-25.  If the recipient fails to comply voluntarily, the complaint may then be \nreferred to OASCR for consideration of further enforcement pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 15.8.  Id. ¶ 25.  \n8 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 19 of 51   PageID #: 339\n\n \nOnly after completion of these steps might USDA refer the matter to the Department of Justice to \npursue judicial action for unlawful discrimination in USDA-administered programs and activities.  See \nContreras Decl. ¶¶ 25-28 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 15.8).  \n  On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that instructed federal \nagencies to evaluate statutes and regulations prohibiting sex discrimination in light of Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).  Executive Order 13988, “Preventing and Combating Discrimination \non the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation,” 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).  In Bostock, \nthe Supreme Court held that Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because of sex” included \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity because “[gay] and transgender status \nare inextricably bound up with sex.”  140 S. Ct. at 1737, 1741-42.   \nIn response to the Executive Order, USDA conducted an independent legal analysis that re-\nexamined the non-discrimination provisions of the statutes and regulations governing USDA-funded \nprograms and activities.  On May 5, 2022, USDA issued a memorandum to the state and regional \ndirectors of FNS programs laying out USDA’s interpretation of the non-discrimination provisions of \nTitle IX and the FNA based on its understanding of Bostock.  See May 5 Memo.2  USDA stated that it \nconcurred with the Departments of Justice and Education in concluding that Title VII’s prohibition \nof discrimination “because of sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), and Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination \n“on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1618(a), were sufficiently similar that Bostock’s interpretation should \napply to Title IX.  See May 5 Memo at 2-3.  USDA likewise found the FNA’s non-discrimination \nprovision—which prohibits discrimination “by reason of … sex,” 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1)—was similar \nenough to Title VII’s language that it was governed by Bostock too.  The May 5 Memo therefore advised \n“[s]tate agencies and program operators . . . [to] expeditiously review their program discrimination \n \n2 The May 5 Memo was transmitted with a cover letter.  Defendants refer to the Memo and its cover \nletter collectively as the “May 5 Memo.” \n9 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 20 of 51   PageID #: 340\n\n \ncomplaint procedures and make any changes necessary to ensure complaints alleging discrimination \non the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation are processed and evaluated as complaints of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.”  May 5 Memo at 3.   \nThough the May 5 Memo set out USDA’s understanding of the non-discrimination provisions \nof Title IX and the FNA, USDA made clear that the Memo “does not determine the outcome in any \nparticular case, which will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of that case.”  Id.  Nor did \nthe Memo address other “legal requirements, including, . . .  Title IX’s religious exemption, the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act . . . and any other applicable exemptions.”  Id.    \nOn the same day as the May 5 Memo, USDA issued two additional documents.  One \ndocument answers anticipated questions about the Memo, see Compl., Ex. C, ECF No. 1-3 (“Q&A \nMemo”), including questions about the updating and placement of “And Justice for All” posters.  The \nQ&A Memo discusses poster production and implementation timing, which had not yet been \nfinalized, as well as potential timing for enforcement of noncompliance.  Id. at 2-3.  The second \ndocument advises state agencies on how to begin the process of updating the non-discrimination \nstatements in their public-facing materials to reflect the May 5 Memo.  Compl., Ex. D, ECF No. 1-4 \n(“May 5 Memo Supplement”).  Neither the Q&A Memo nor the May 5 Memo Supplement purports \nto have any independent legal effect.  See generally id., Ex. C & Ex. D.3 \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \nPlaintiffs filed their Complaint on July 26, 2022, alleging that the USDA, in issuing the May 5 \nMemo and the Final Rule, violated the APA and assorted provisions of the Constitution.  See generally \nCompl.  Plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary injunction the same day, requesting preliminary \ninjunctive relief and seeking expedited consideration of the Motion.  Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 3, ECF \n \n3 For ease of reference, Defendants will refer primarily to the Final Rule and the May 5 Memo unless \nthe other documents have some additional relevance. \n10 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 21 of 51   PageID #: 341\n\n \nNo. 2 (“Motion”).  In explaining their purported need for expedition, Plaintiffs cited to the SNAP-\nEd-related August 15, 2022, deadline for incorporating the updated USDA non-discrimination \nstatement.  Id.  The Court sua sponte denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited briefing on two grounds.  \nFirst, the Court explained that it would be improper to consider the Motion before Defendants had \nbeen served and had a fair opportunity to respond.  Order at 3-4, ECF No. 33.  Second, the Court \nfound that no good cause existed for expedition because “Plaintiffs States repeatedly and clearly state \nthat they ‘do not deny benefits based on a household member’s sexual orientation or gender identity’ \nfor purposes of administering SNAP benefits.”  Id. at 4.  Further, the Court noted that Plaintiffs’ \nbriefing “does not explain how incorporating the Rule’s language, regarding only SNAP benefits, \nwould impact their state laws regarding sports participation, restroom use, religious freedom, or free \nspeech.”  Id.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy” that “may only be awarded \nupon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Fowler v. Benson, 924 F.3d 247, 256 \n(6th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted).  The party moving for a preliminary injunction has the burden of \nproof, see Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cnty. Gov’t, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002), and that \nburden must be met “by a clear showing.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (cleaned \nup).  Even then, the final decision of whether a preliminary injunction should issue is within the court’s \ndiscretion.  Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Mich. Brick, Inc., 679 F.2d 100, 102 (6th Cir. 1982). \nIn determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, courts consider four factors: “(1) \nwhether the party moving for the injunction is facing immediate, irreparable harm, (2) the likelihood \nthat the movant will succeed on the merits, (3) the balance of the equities, and (4) the public interest.”  \nD.T. v. Sumner Cnty. Schs., 942 F.3d 324, 326 (6th Cir. 2019).  Where the federal government is the \ndefendant, the last two factors merge.  Daunt v. Benson, 956 F.3d 396, 422 (6th Cir. 2020).  And while \n11 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 22 of 51   PageID #: 342\n\n \nthe factors may be balanced, “the existence of an irreparable injury is mandatory.”  D.T., 942 F.3d at \n326–27 (citation omitted).  Indeed, parties “requesting a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that \nirreparable harm is not merely possible, but likely.”  Blair v. Nationwide Ins. Co. of Am., No. 121CV00059, \n2021 WL 1795163, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. May 5, 2021) (citation omitted). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS \nA.  Plaintiffs  Lack  Standing  Because  Their  Injuries  Are  Either  Not  Ripe,  Not \nTraceable, Or Not Redressable \nA foundational principle of Article III is that “an actual controversy must exist not only at the \ntime the complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation.” Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. \n85, 90–91 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “In an attempt to give meaning to Article III’s \n‘case or controversy’ requirement, the courts have developed a series of principles termed ‘justiciability \ndoctrines.’  The Article III doctrine that requires a litigant to have ‘standing’ to invoke the jurisdiction \nof a federal court is perhaps the most important.”  National Rifle Ass’n of Am. v. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, \n279 (6th Cir. 1997).  A related justiciability doctrine is that of ripeness, which “prevents courts from \nhearing premature or abstract disagreements.”  Platt v. Bd. of Comm’rs on Grievances & Discipline of Ohio \nSup. Ct., 769 F.3d 447, 451 (6th Cir. 2014).   \nTo establish standing, Plaintiffs “must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  Where a plaintiff seeks \nprospective relief, as Plaintiffs do here, the “threatened injury must be certainly impending to \nconstitute injury in fact”; “[a]llegations of possible future injury are not sufficient.”  Clapper v. Amnesty \nInt’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) (citation omitted).  The prospect of enforcing a purportedly \nunlawful statutory or regulatory regime against a plaintiff must be “sufficiently imminent” to create a \nconcrete injury.  Platt, 769 F.3d at 451 (6th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  A “theory of standing [that] \n12 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 23 of 51   PageID #: 343\n\n \nrelies on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities, does not satisfy” this requirement.  Clapper, 568 U.S. \nat 410.  “The plaintiff . . . bears the burden of establishing these elements,” and therefore “must clearly \n. . . allege facts demonstrating each element.”  Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547. \nRipeness is a justiciability doctrine designed “to prevent the courts, through avoidance of \npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative \npolicies,” and “also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision \nhas been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.’”  Nat’l Park Hosp. \nAss’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807–08 (2003) (citation omitted).  As the Sixth Circuit has \nrecognized, “[a]nswering difficult legal questions before they arise and before the courts know how \nthey will arise is not the way we typically handle constitutional litigation.”  Warshak v. United States, 532 \nF.3d 521, 526 (6th Cir. 2008).  The ripeness test comprises two elements: (1) the fitness of the matter \nfor adjudication, and (2) the hardship to the plaintiffs in withholding relief.  Id. at 525. \nA claim is not fit for review unless it involves a concrete dispute, Princeton Univ. v. Schmid, 455 \nU.S. 100, 102 (1982).  In other words, “a general interest in a judicial ruling on the merits does not by \nitself confer jurisdiction on the federal courts.”  Warshak, 532 F.3d at 532.  In a pre-enforcement \nchallenge to a statutory scheme, where a court has “no idea whether or when” the statute will be \nenforced against the plaintiff and “no idea what” the particular factual circumstances of any ultimate \ndispute will be, a claim is not ripe.  Id. at 526 (citation omitted).  Accordingly, a party’s claim “is not \nripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or \nindeed may not occur at all.”  Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (citation omitted). \nStanding and ripeness may be analyzed together where the analyses overlap as they do here.  \nPlatt, 769 F.3d at 451.  Plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden to demonstrate either.   \nPlaintiffs argue that they will be imminently harmed for the following three reasons:  First, \nthey allege that USDA’s actions interfere with their sovereign authority to enforce and administer their \n13 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 24 of 51   PageID #: 344\n\n \nlaws, Compl. ¶ 138, because they will be forced to agree to prevent discrimination under the terms \nestablished in the Final Rule to enter into any SNAP agreement, id. ¶ 123, and will be required to \nincorporate USDA’s non-discrimination statement and policies in order to use federal funds, id. ¶ 125, \nall of which “at least arguably conflict” with some of the States’ laws, see id. ¶¶ 130-31.  Second, Plaintiffs \nallege that the enforcement of the policies set forth in the May 5 Memo or their refusal to accept the \nFinal Rule’s terms “could cause Plaintiff States to lose significant federal funds from the USDA,” id. \n¶ 132, and would “impose immediate administrative and compliance costs and burdens on Plaintiffs,” \nid. ¶ 139.  Third, they fear that “USDA’s actions could trigger Title IX enforcement action by the \nDepartment of Education, which enforces Title IX.”  Id. ¶ 133.   \nNone of these alleged harms establishes that Plaintiffs’ purported injuries are ripe, traceable, \nor redressable.     \n1.  Plaintiffs Have Not Plausibly Alleged Harm to Their Sovereignty, or that Such Harm is Ripe, \nTraceable, or Redressable By Vacating the May 5 Memo and Final Rule \n \nPlaintiffs principally claim that their sovereignty will be infringed by the May 5 Memo and \nFinal Rule.  But they cannot show that there is a live controversy ripe for adjudication, that their \nalleged injury is traceable to those documents as opposed to Title IX and the FNA, or that the Court \ncould redress their injuries by setting aside those documents.  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege only \nthat the Final Rule and May 5 Memo “at least arguably conflict” with only some of their state laws.  \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 130-31 (identifying state laws for only thirteen of the twenty-two Plaintiff States).  But, \nas the Court has already noted, the “Plaintiff States’ briefing . . . does not explain how incorporating \nthe Rule’s language, regarding only SNAP benefits, would impact their states laws regarding sports \nparticipation, restroom use, religious freedom, or free speech.”  Order at 4, ECF No. 33.  Indeed, \nPlaintiffs affirm that they do not engage in discrimination in the administration of SNAP on the basis \nof gender identity or sexual orientation, see Compl. ¶¶ 12, 40; Br. at 1,17, and do not allege that their \nstate laws require them to do so.  Plaintiffs have identified no more than an abstract disagreement \n14 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 25 of 51   PageID #: 345\n\n \nwith the agencies’ interpretation of the law.  That is not sufficient to establish standing.  Nat’l Park \nHosp. Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 807–08; Warshak, 532 F.3d at 526; See Sch. of the Ozarks, Inc. v. Biden, 41 F.4th \n992, 998 (8th Cir. 2022) (holding that plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge an agency \nmemorandum that did not require the agency to “reach [a] specific enforcement decision”).  And \nbecause Plaintiffs would have a full opportunity to present their claims in a future enforcement \nproceeding against them, they face no hardship from the withholding of judicial review now.     \nDefendants acknowledge that another court addressing a similar challenge brought by many \nof these same Plaintiffs against the Department of Education concluded that the States had alleged a \nsufficiently ripe injury to their sovereignty.  Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 3:21-cv-308, 2022 WL \n2791450, at *24 (E.D. Tenn. July 15, 2022) (“Tennessee”).  Defendants respectfully disagree with that \ndecision, which is not binding on this Court.  Ass’n of Cultural Exch. Orgs., Inc. v. Blinken, 543 F. Supp. \n3d 570, 575 n.2 (W.D. Tenn. 2021).  Further, that court concluded that the States had adequately \nalleged that “their sovereign power to enforce their own legal code is hampered by the issuance of \n[the Department of Education’s] guidance and they face substantial pressure to change their state laws \nas a result.”  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *12.  The same cannot be said here, as this Court has \nalready noted.  Order at 4, ECF No. 33.  The Tennessee court also ruled that the States “have shown a \ncredible threat of enforcement,” and that at least the State of Tennessee faces “considerable financial \npenalties for violating Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination.”  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at \n*12.  Here, Plaintiffs have not alleged a credible threat of enforcement or considerable financial \npenalties for sex discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender \nidentity, given that the States have disavowed any intention of engaging in such conduct. \nFurthermore, even if Plaintiffs had identified a concrete, ripe conflict with their laws, any \nsovereign injury they might suffer would be traceable only to the FNA and Title IX, not to the Final \nRule and May 5 Memo.  The Final Rule and May 5 Memo’s explanation that discrimination on the \n15 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 26 of 51   PageID #: 346\n\n \nbasis  of  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity  is  prohibited  does  not  have  independent  legal \nsignificance.  It is Title IX and the FNA that prohibit such discrimination on the basis of sex, and they \nwould prohibit it even if the Final Rule and May 5 Memo had never been issued.  Indeed, consistent \nwith its interpretations of Title IX and the FNA, USDA’s internal regulation, DR 4330-002, requires \nUSDA employees to ensure programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance from USDA \nare in compliance with applicable civil rights laws, and identifies discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation and gender identity as prohibited conduct.  See Contreras Decl. ¶ 12.  Accordingly, even in \nthe absence of the Final Rule and May 5 Memo, USDA would still be able to enforce the prohibitions \non sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in Title IX and the FNA.  \n     For similar reasons, an injunction invalidating the Final Rule and May 5 Memo and \nprohibiting Defendants from “enforcing” them would not redress Plaintiffs’ alleged sovereign injury.  \nThose documents are neither the source of any harm nor the source of USDA’s enforcement \nauthority.  Plaintiffs ask the Court in part to “hold[] unlawful the Department’s Memoranda and Final \nRule,” Compl. at 49 (Prayer for Relief ¶ A), and to issue “preliminary and permanent injunction[s] \nprohibiting Defendants . . . from enforcing the Memoranda and Final Rule,” id. at 50 (Prayer for Relief \n¶ I).  But such an injunction would not redress any injury, because USDA does not “enforce” the \nFinal Rule or May 5 Memo; USDA enforces Title IX and the FNA.  Courts may not “enjoin” an \nagency’s view of the law.  See Whole Women’s Health v. Jackson, 142 S. Ct. 522, 535 (2021) (“[A] federal \ncourt exercising its equitable authority may enjoin named defendants from taking specified unlawful \nactions. But . . . no court may . . . purport to enjoin challenged ‘laws themselves.’”). \n2.  Plaintiffs Fail to Plausibly Allege a Loss of Federal Funds and Compliance Costs Or that Such \nInjury Is Sufficiently Imminent or Ripe \n  \nPlaintiffs also allege that they are in imminent danger of a loss of significant federal funds if \nthey fail to comply with the May 5 Memo and the Final Rule, but they have not shown that any action \nthat might lead to such an injury is sufficiently imminent for standing and ripeness purposes.  Plaintiffs \n16 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 27 of 51   PageID #: 347\n\n \nallege that they “face an immediate threat that the USDA will enforce the Final Rule against Plaintiffs,” \nCompl. ¶ 126, because they face “an immediate requirement (‘120 days after the publication of the \nregulations in final form’) to accept the Final Rule’s terms in SNAP Federal-State Agreements.” Id. \n¶ 124.4  They also allege that they faced “an imminent deadline” of August 15, 2022, for the SNAP-\nEd program to “incorporate the new USDA non-discrimination statement and policies to various \nprojects.”  Id. ¶ 125.5  Plaintiffs claim that they are at risk of losing “significant federal funds” if they \nfail to meet these deadlines.  Id. ¶ 134.   \nBut Plaintiffs again fail to plausibly allege an imminent injury.  Not one Plaintiff-State alleges \nthat it will refuse to sign the new SNAP FSAs if those agreements contain the Final Rule’s updated \nstandard non-discrimination language.  In fact, fourteen of the Plaintiffs, including the only two who \nsubmitted declarations in support of their Motion—Tennessee and Alaska—have already entered into \nnew SNAP FSAs containing the updated non-discrimination language; three have indicated that they \nexpect to do so by December 13, 2022; and only one, Mississippi, has offered alternative language as \npermitted by the Final Rule for states concerned about the language in the SNAP FSA, see Kline Decl. \n¶¶ 14-15 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b)(2)).  Mississippi, however, does not allege that any of its state laws \nconflict with the Final Rule or May 5 Memo, see Compl. ¶ 131.  Accordingly, none of the Plaintiffs \nplausibly allege in their Complaint or adduce evidence in their Motion that they are in imminent danger \n \n4 The Final Rule became effective on August 15, 2022; States must submit their new signed FSA by \nDecember 15, 2022.  Kline Decl. ¶ 13.   \n5 Plaintiffs allege in their Complaint that the imminence of the enforcement threat posed by these \ndeadlines is established by the Q&A Memo, which Plaintiffs claim “state[s] that ‘there will not be a \ngrace period’’ for changing discrimination complaint procedures.”  Compl. ¶ 127. But Plaintiffs fail to \neven mention the “grace period” issue in their Motion.  Further, the full sentence in the Q&A Memo \nstates “there will not be a grace period for accepting and processing discrimination complaints based on sexual \norientation and gender identity in FNS programs.”  Q&A Memo at 3 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs do \nnot allege that they will refuse to accept and process complaints, so they fail to allege any reason why \nUSDA would threaten an enforcement action.   \n \n17 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 28 of 51   PageID #: 348\n\n \nof losing significant federal funds.  See Sch. of the Ozarks, Inc., 41 F.4th at 998 (concluding that it was \nspeculative that HUD would file a charge of discrimination against the plaintiff and that the plaintiff’s \nclaimed injury was based on a “highly attenuated chain of possibilities”) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, neither the Final Rule nor the May 5 Memo suggests that States will lose their \nfunding immediately in the event of noncompliance.  FNS’s suspension and disallowance process \nprovides multiple opportunities for the offending state agency to come into compliance.  See Kline \nDecl. ¶ 17.  Indeed, only after a state agency fails to respond satisfactorily to an Advance Notification, \nFormal Warning, or corrective action proposal does FNS consider suspending or disallowing funds, \nid., and the extent of such suspension or disallowance is subject to the Secretary’s discretion.  Id.; see \nalso 7 U.S.C. § 2020(g).  Further, such a disallowance is appealable to the State SNAP Appeals Board, \nand ultimately subject to judicial review.  See Kline Decl. ¶ 18. \nFNS’s Civil Rights Division (“CRD”) likewise has an elaborate enforcement process that aims \nto resolve a complaint at the lowest possible level.  Contreras Decl. ¶¶ 22, 25.  If the process does not \nresolve the complaint, CRD proceeds through an investigative stage, produces a report, and then \nissues a Final Agency Decision, which is appealable to OASCR.  Id. ¶ 23.  If OASCR affirms the Final \nAgency Decision, USDA may seek compliance through the procedures set forth at 7 C.F.R. § 15.8 or \nthrough other authorized means, including reference to the Department of Justice.  See Contreras \nDecl. ¶¶ 26-28 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 15.8).  According to CRD’s declarant, FNS has never sought to \nsuspend, terminate, or refuse to grant or to continue financial assistance to a State under 7 C.F.R. \n§ 15.8.  Contreras Decl. ¶ 30. \nIn light of these highly reticulated enforcement processes, through which Plaintiffs can present \ntheir claims, and the absence of any historical precedent of USDA suspending, terminating, or refusing \nfinancial assistance pursuant to those processes, Plaintiffs are unable to show that their alleged fiscal \ninjuries are ripe.    \n18 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 29 of 51   PageID #: 349\n\n \n3.  Plaintiffs Do not Plausibly Allege that Any Harm Due to Enforcement by Department of \nEducation Is Ripe, Traceable, or Redressable \n \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ alleged fear that the Final Rule and May 5 Memo “could trigger Title IX \nenforcement action by the Department of Education, which enforces Title IX,” Compl. ¶ 133, is not \nonly unripe, but also untraceable to USDA, and could not be redressed by an order of this Court.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs fail to identify any imminent enforcement action by the Department of Education, \nnever mind a causal connection between such an enforcement action and USDA’s Final Rule and the \nMay 5 Memo.  Indeed, the Department of Education is currently enjoined from implementing its \nanalogous interpretive documents as to nearly every Plaintiff State.  See Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, \nat *24.  But even if this were not the case, Plaintiffs fail to allege or identify any actual, impending \nenforcement action from violations of Title IX, or imminent loss of federal funding.  Moreover, the \nDepartment of Education similarly attempts to resolve matters by informal means where possible, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1682; 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(d), allowing Plaintiffs the opportunity to remedy any issues before \nany loss of federal funds would occur.  Finally, the federal government is entitled to enforce violations \nof Title IX regardless of the existence of the USDA’s Final Rule and May 5 Memo, so Plaintiffs’ fears \nof enforcement are neither traceable to nor redressable by the invalidation of USDA’s challenged \ndocuments.  Cf. Nuclear Info. & Res. Serv. v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 457 F.3d 941 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding \nthat even if plaintiff was harmed by one agency’s regulation, the existence of another agency’s \nunchallenged regulation made the injury unredressable).   \nB.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Because Plaintiffs Have an Adequate Alternative \nRemedy Under Title IX and the FNA, and that Remedy is Exclusive \n \nThis Court also lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims for two additional reasons:  First, the \nAPA’s alternative remedy provision precludes them from bringing this action because they can raise \ntheir arguments in defense of any future Title IX or FNA enforcement action.  Second, Congress \n19 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 30 of 51   PageID #: 350\n\n \nintended Title IX and the FNA to create exclusive avenues for challenging enforcement actions \nbrought by the federal government under those laws.  \nThe APA conditions judicial review on the requirement that there be no other adequate avenue \nof judicial review.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (permitting judicial review of “final agency action for which there \nis no other adequate remedy in a court”).  To determine whether the APA precludes review of an \naction where there is an adequate alternative remedy, “the essential inquiry is whether another \nstatutory scheme of judicial review exists so as to preclude review under the more general provisions \nof the APA.”  Bangura v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 487, 501 (6th Cir. 2006).  Where “Congress did not intend \nthe general grant of review in the APA to duplicate existing procedures for review of agency action” \na court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over APA claims.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 \n(1988).  Here, for example, if the United States filed suit against one of the Plaintiffs for having violated \nTitle IX or the FNA, that State would “[a]lmost by definition [] have an adequate remedy in a court, \nthat is, the remedy of opposing the . . . motion in . . . court.”  N.A.A.C.P. v. Meese, 615 F. Supp. 200, \n2013 (D.D.C. 1985).  Such an opposition brief would afford a judicial forum that would “obviat[e] the \nneed for resort to the APA.”  Id.   \nDefendants recognize that the Tennessee court rejected a similar argument, but its analysis is \nflawed and inapt here.  The Tennessee court concluded that a pre-enforcement challenge is permitted \nwhere the alternative would require a respondent to accrue liability while waiting for the government \nbring an enforcement action.  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *17 (citing Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 127 \n(2012)).  The Tennessee court relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett, noting that in “Sackett, \nlegal consequences flowed from the Government’s compliance order, as it exposed the landowners to \nincreased financial penalties in subsequent civil enforcement proceedings.”  Id.  The Tennesssee court \nacknowledged that the plaintiff-states before it did “not face consequences as concrete as those in \nSackett,” but nevertheless concluded that the Department of Education’s “guidance documents do \n20 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 31 of 51   PageID #: 351\n\n \nimpose an immediate hardship on Plaintiffs,” including the “risk of incurring significant financial \npenalties.”  Id.  Here, USDA’s enforcement regime makes clear that Plaintiffs will not lose funding \nprior to an enforcement action, which would only occur after informal means of resolution are \nattempted, so the Tennessee court’s conclusion is not warranted here.  See, e.g., Kline Decl. ¶¶ 17-18; \nContreras Decl. ¶ 26.     \nSecond, Congress did not intend for pre-enforcement judicial review of any USDA action \nseeking to remedy violations of Title IX or the FNA because it mandated extensive administrative \nenforcement proceedings culminating in the opportunity for judicial review.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1682-\n1683 (Title IX); 7 U.S.C. §§ 2020(g), 2023 (FNA).  Where it is “fairly discernable” that an elaborate \nstatutory review scheme was intended to create an exclusive remedy, parallel jurisdiction outside that \nscheme is precluded.  See Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207, 216 (citation omitted); see also Elgin v. Dep’t of \nTreasury, 567 U.S. 1 (2012).  As in Thunder Basin, this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider \nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the USDA’s interpretation of Title IX or the FNA before the United States has \ninitiated any enforcement proceedings.  Plaintiffs style their Complaint as challenging the statutory \ninterpretation announced in Defendants’ documents, but the same was true in Thunder Basin. 510 U.S. \nat 205 (describing plaintiff’s pre-enforcement “challenge [to] the [agency’s] interpretation of” a \nstatute).  Courts have long refused to allow funding recipients to circumvent the civil rights laws’ \nadministrative enforcement processes in this manner.  See, e.g., Taylor v. Cohen, 405 F.2d 277 (4th Cir. \n1968) (en banc); Sch. Dist. of City of Saginaw v. U.S. Dep’t of Health, Educ., & Welfare, 431 F. Supp. 147 \n(E.D. Mich. 1977).  Indeed, in Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. \nSupp. 3d 850, 859-64 (S.D. Ohio 2016) (“Highland”), another district court in the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that it lacked jurisdiction over a school district’s challenge to an agency’s guidance \ndocuments discussing Title IX’s application to discrimination against transgender students because \nthere was an adequate remedy through Title IX’s administrative process.  \n21 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 32 of 51   PageID #: 352\n\n \nThe Tennessee court rejected this argument as well, but failed to distinguish or even reference \nHighland, choosing instead to cite out-of-circuit or outdated cases.  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450 at *19.  \nFurther, the Tennessee court mistakenly agreed with Plaintiffs, see id., that their challenge to the agency’s \nrules distinguished their claims from those barred in Thunder Basin, despite the fact, as noted above, \nthat the same argument was rejected in Thunder Basin itself.  Last, the Tennessee court did not have the \nFNA before it.  In light of the extensive administrative review scheme Congress established in that \nstatute, see 7 U.S.C. §§ 2020(g), 2023, it is more than “fairly discernable” that Congress intended to \npreclude pre-enforcement challenges in federal court. Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 216; Highland, 208 F. \nSupp. 3d at 861. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR MERITS \nA.  The May 5 Memo Was Not a Final Agency Action Subject to Judicial Review Under \nthe APA \nPlaintiffs challenge the Final Rule and May 5 Memo as being contrary to law, arbitrary and \ncapricious, and issued without the requisite procedure (i.e., notice-and-comment rulemaking).  Br. at \n9-10, 12.  However, Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the May 5 Memo and its associated documents are \nunlikely to succeed because they are challenging an interpretive document that does not constitute \nfinal agency action over which courts can exercise judicial review.  See Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, \n197 (1993).  The APA permits judicial review only of “final agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, which is \nagency action that is (1) “the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and that (2) also \ndetermines “rights or obligations.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (citations omitted).  The \nMay 5 Memo does not determine anyone’s “rights or obligations”; instead, it is an interpretative \ndocument that does not “‘create new law, rights or duties, . . . [but rather] ‘simply state[s] what the \nadministrative agency thinks the statute means” and “only reminds affected parties of existing duties.’”  \nTenn. Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting Michigan v. Thomas, 805 F.2d \n22 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 33 of 51   PageID #: 353\n\n \n176, 182-83 (6th Cir. 1986)).)6   \nAbsent a statute to the contrary, the issuance of an agency policy is not ordinarily a final action \nthat can be directly challenged under the APA.  See Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 891 \n(1990); see also Reno v. Cath. Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 57-61 (1993).  Instead, judicial review must wait \nuntil “concrete effects” from the policy are felt.  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 891; see also Ctr. for \nAuto Safety v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 452 F.3d 798, 811 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  By contrast, agency \naction that constitutes a “substantive rule” may be reviewed if it has an immediate legal or practical \ncoercive effect.  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. at 891; Reno, 509 U.S. at 57.     \nSubstantive rules stand in contrast to interpretative rules or general statements of policy.  5 \nU.S.C. § 553(b).  An agency policy is a substantive (or “legislative”) rule only if it “impose[s] new rights \nor duties and change[s] the legal status of regulated parties.”  Mann Constr., Inc. v. United States, 27 F.4th \n1138, 1143 (6th Cir. 2022).  In contrast, “the critical feature of interpretive rules is that they are ‘issued \nby an agency to advise the public of the agency’s construction of the statutes and rules which it \nadministers.’” Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 97 (2015), 575 U.S. at 97 (citation omitted); see \nalso Mann Constr., 27 F.4th at 1143 (quoting same from Perez); Tenn. Hosp. Ass’n, 908 F.3d at 1042 \n(same).  Similarly, a general statement of policy “‘advise[s] the public prospectively of the manner in \nwhich the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.’”  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 197.   \nBecause the May 5 Memo merely announces USDA’s interpretation of Title IX and the FNA, \nit lacks the requisite legal effect to be a final agency action.  See Mann Constr., 27 F.4th at 1143; Tenn. \nHosp. Ass’n, 908 F.3d at 1042.  It is not a substantive rule because it “create[s] no new legal obligations \n \n6 The Sixth Circuit appears to have variously treated the absence of a final agency action as a \njurisdictional matter, see also Gaye v. Lynch, 788 F.3d 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2015), and a merits issue, see \nJama v. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 760 F.3d 490, 494 & n.4 (6th Cir. 2014).  Treating it as a merits \nquestion appears to be the more customary approach.  See Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 456 F.3d 178, \n184 (D.C.Cir.2006) (“[T]he APA’s final agency action requirement is not jurisdictional”).  But the \nproper result is the same under either approach. \n23 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 34 of 51   PageID #: 354\n\n \nbeyond those the [statute] already imposed,” Rhea Lana, Inc. v. Dep’t of Lab., 824 F.3d 1023, 1028 (D.C. \nCir. 2016); Mann Constr., 27 F.4th at 1143.  The May 5 Memo “simply states what the administrative \nagency thinks the statute[s] mean[].”  First Nat’l Bank of Lexington v. Sanders, 946 F.2d 1185, 1188 (6th \nCir. 1991).   \nPlaintiffs’ two arguments that the May 5 Memo and its associated documents set forth a \nsubstantive rule are without merit.  First, Plaintiffs argue that “legal consequences undoubtedly flow \nfrom the” documents because Plaintiffs “collectively risk the loss of over $28 billion [in SNAP funds] \nif they do not comply with USDA’s directives to adopt new policies, binding contractual language, \nand enforcement procedures contained within” those documents.  Br. at 7-8.  However, the May 5 \nMemo and its associated documents merely inform the public of the Department’s interpretation of \nthe sex discrimination laws governing USDA-funded programs and activities.  Only an action to \nenforce compliance with that interpretation under particular facts and circumstances could determine \na party’s rights or obligations regarding the laws.   FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 246 \n(1980).  USDA would have to take numerous steps aimed at achieving compliance before it could \neven bring an enforcement action.  The unquantifiable and speculative “risk” that these steps will \noccur is not a legal consequence sufficient to make something final agency action. \nRather, “[a]s long as the agency remains free to consider the individual facts in the various \ncases that arise, then the agency action in question has not established a binding norm” and will not \namount to a substantive rule.  Pros. & Patients for Customized Care v. Shalala, 56 F.3d 592, 594–97 (5th \nCir. 1995) (citation omitted).  Policies that are “not outcome determinative” cannot have force of law \nand therefore cannot be substantive rules.  Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Azar, 316 F. Supp. 3d 291, \n307-08 (D.D.C. 2018), vacated as moot, 942 F.3d 512 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Here, the May 5 Memo provides \nthat its “interpretation . . . does not determine the outcome in any particular case, which will depend \non the specific facts and circumstances of that case” as well as “legal requirements, including, where \n24 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 35 of 51   PageID #: 355\n\n \napplicable, Title IX’s religious exemption, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act . . . and any other \napplicable exemptions.”  May 5 Memo at 3.  Merely “advis[ing] the public prospectively of the manner \nin which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power” does not create a substantive rule.  \nLincoln, 508 U.S. at 197 (citation omitted).   \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that the May 5 Memo and its associated documents collectively set \nforth  a  substantive  rule  because  they  “impos[e]  on  regulated  entities  a  new  obligation  not  to \ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity—an obligation that appears nowhere \nin the Title IX or the Food and Nutrition Act” and “implement a number of duties and other \n“changes” that “impact [State] operations.”  Br. at 11 (citation omitted) (second alteration in original).  \nThese arguments are meritless because, as has been reiterated, (a) the obligations flow from Title IX \nand the FNA, not the documents reflecting USDA’s interpretations of those statutes, and (b) Plaintiffs \ncould only suffer practical or legal consequences from USDA’s interpretations at the conclusion of an \nenforcement proceeding. \nDefendants note that the Tennessee court found that the Department of Education’s similar \ninterpretive documents constituted a substantive rule.  Respectfully, the court’s decision was in error \nas it wrongly concluded that reading Title IX in accordance with Bostock ’s reading of Title VII went \n“beyond putting the public on notice of pre-existing legal obligations and reminding affected parties \nof their existing duties.”  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at * 21.  Even if the Tennessee court were correct, \nthe FNA—which was not at issue in that case—would still supply the basis for the pre-existing legal \nobligations elucidated by the Final Rule. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Notice-and-Comment Claim Is Unlikely to Succeed Because the May 5 \nMemo Is Not Subject to that Requirement and the Final Rule Was Properly Issued \nAfter Notice-and-Comment \n \nAs laid out above, the May 5 Memo is an interpretive rule that does not require notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking.  See Michigan, 805 F.2d at 183 (“[An] interpretative rule . . . does not require \n25 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 36 of 51   PageID #: 356\n\n \nnotice and comment procedures prior to its adoption.”).  Plaintiffs therefore have no likelihood of \nsuccess on their claims that it was required to go through that rulemaking process.  See Br. at 9-10. \nPlaintiffs’ notice-and-comment challenge to the Final Rule is unlikely to succeed because that \npolicy document went through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  Plaintiffs argue that the notice-and-\ncomment process was defective as to the updated discrimination statement in the Final Rule because \nthat statement is purportedly not a logical outgrowth of the Proposed Rule on which the public \ncommented.  Br. at 9-10.  This argument is unlikely to succeed because USDA’s Proposed Rule gave \n“a description of the subjects and issues involved” in the rule, as required by 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3).  The \nProposed Rule made clear that it was intended to “update[] FSA language [to] emphasize existing non-\ndiscrimination protections for SNAP households to the effect that no person in the United States \nshall, on the grounds of sex” or other protected traits be the “subject of discrimination under SNAP.”  \n81 Fed. Reg. at 81,016-17.  To do this, the anticipated rule “would incorporate references to additional \ncivil rights legislation[, including Title IX,] into the standard FSA language,” which already included a \nprohibition on sex discrimination.  Id. at 81,015, 81,017.   \nAt the time, significant litigation was already pending regarding the meaning of Title IX’s \nprohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681, especially in relation to \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity in schools.  See G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. \nBd., 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016); Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., No. 16-CV-\n943-PP, 2016 WL 5239829 (E.D. Wis. Sept. 22, 2016); Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 859-64; Texas v. \nUnited States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 826–27 (N.D. Tex. 2016).  The public was on notice that USDA \nwas contemplating making the non-discrimination statement in the FSA explicitly incorporate Title \nIX’s non-discrimination provision and providing more detail about the “existing non-discrimination \nprotections for SNAP households.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 81,016.  That USDA might incorporate judicial \n26 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 37 of 51   PageID #: 357\n\n \ndecisions regarding the meaning of Title IX’s non-discrimination language related to gender identity \nand sexual orientation was entirely foreseeable. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Contrary-to-Law Claim Is Unlikely to Succeed \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint and preliminary injunction motion center on their contention that \nUSDA’s interpretation of the phrases “on the basis of sex” in Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), and “by \nreason of . . . sex” in the FNA, 7 U.SC. § 2020(c)(1), are unlawful.  See Compl. ¶¶ 178-97; Br. at 12-\n19.  But that can hardly be the case in light of Bostock.  Courts have recognized that “Title IX’s language \nclosely resembles Title VII’s.”  Peltier v. Charter Day Sch., Inc., 8 F.4th 251, 273 (4th Cir. 2021) (explaining \nthat although Bostock involved Title VII rather than Title IX, its reasoning “is consistent with the \nbroadly applicable text of Title IX”), aff’d in part and vacated in part, 37 F.4th 104(4th Cir. 2022); Wolfe v. \nFayetteville, Ark. Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 860, 866 (8th Cir. 2011) (holding that the “Supreme Court’s \ninterpretation of Title VII properly informs our examination of Title IX”).  The resemblance is \nparticularly notable with respect to the language at issue in Bostock.  Just as Title VII prohibits \ndiscrimination “because of” sex, Title IX prohibits discrimination against that individual “on the basis \nof sex.”  See, e.g., Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753 (holding “that employers are prohibited from firing \nemployees on the basis of [sexual orientation] or transgender status”) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs argue \nthat there is significance to the linguistic differences in Title VII’s “because of,” Title IX’s “on the \nbasis of,” and FNA’s “by reason of.”  See Br. at 16-17. However, in Bostock, the Supreme Court used \nthe terms interchangeably.  See 140 S. Ct. at 1740-41 (stating both that an employer may not \nintentionally treat “a person worse because of sex,” and that “it is impossible to discriminate against a \nperson” for reasons related to their gender identity or sexual preference “without discriminating based \non sex”) (emphasis added). \nIndeed, because of the similar phrasing, courts have consistently recognized that Bostock’s \nreasoning extends to Title IX, and Plaintiffs have identified no case to the contrary.  See, e.g., Grimm v. \n27 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 38 of 51   PageID #: 358\n\n \nGloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 618 (4th Cir. 2020); Boston All. of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & \nTransgender Youth v. HHS, 557 F. Supp. 3d 224, 244 (D. Mass.  2021) (holding that “[t]hough Bostock \nwas a Title VII case, the Supreme Court’s reasoning applies equally outside of Title VII.”); Doe v. Univ. \nof Scranton, No. 3:19-cv-01486, 2020 WL 5993766, at *5 n.61 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 9, 2020) (finding \n“persuasive” the argument that Bostock extends to Title IX); see also Walker v. Azar, 480 F. Supp. 3d \n417, 430 (E.D.N.Y. 2020); Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. HHS, 485 F. Supp. 3d 1, 64 (D.D.C. 2020).   \nPlaintiffs highlight dicta from the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492 \n(6th Cir. 2021), that “Title VII differs from Title IX in important respects,” id. at 510 n.4, see Br. at 13, \nbut the Sixth Circuit did not identify the specific language at issue here as being the differentiating \nfactor between Title VII and Title IX.  Indeed, the Sixth Circuit has recognized that “[g]enerally, courts \nhave looked to Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, as an analog for the legal standards in both Title IX \ndiscrimination and retaliation claims.”  Nelson v. Christian Bros. Univ., 226 F. App’x 448, 454 (6th Cir. \n2007) (citations omitted).   \nFurther, Meriwether did not address the FNA, and it cannot be said that the FNA’s “by reason \n. . . of sex” is meaningfully different from the language in Title VII or Title IX.  In fact, in Bostock, the \nSupreme Court explained in clear terms that “as this Court has previously explained, ‘the ordinary \nmeaning of ‘because of’ is ‘by reason of’’ or ‘on account of.’”  140 S. Ct. at 1739 (emphasis added) \n(quoting Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 350 (2013)).   Plaintiffs also briefly reference \nPelcha v. MW Bancorp., Inc., 988 F.3d 318 (6th Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 461 (2021); see Br. at 13, \nas relevant to this issue, but that case concerned neither Title IX nor the FNA.  \n  The  absence  of  any  substantial  linguistic  or  structural  distinction  between  the  non-\ndiscrimination mandates in Title VII, Title IX or the FNA renders Plaintiffs’ claims unlikely to \nsucceed.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs argue that Bostock’s reasoning was unlawfully applied by USDA to \nTitle IX because “Title IX—unlike Title VII—also expressly authorizes separation based on sex in \n28 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 39 of 51   PageID #: 359\n\n \ncertain circumstances,” for example, by allowing “certain single-sex educational institutions and \norganizations,” and allowing entities to maintain separate living facilities for different sexes.  Br. at 13 \n(citing 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(1)-(9) & 1686).  The Fourth Circuit rejected a similar argument in Grimm, \nwhere it held that the violation of Title IX is not in maintaining sex-separated facilities; it is in excluding \ntransgender students from the sex-separated facility or program matching their gender identities.  972 \nF.3d at 618.  \nPlaintiffs fail in particular to explain how the text of the FNA can be distinguished from Title \nVII.  They argue that “the term ‘sex’ ha[s] the same binary biological meaning” in the FNA as in Title \nIX.  Br. at 15.  But that point is irrelevant.  In Bostock, the Supreme Court assumed, for the sake of \nargument, “that ‘sex’ signified . . . biological distinctions between male and female.”  140 S. Ct. at \n1739.  But that was “just a starting point.  The question isn’t just what ‘sex’ meant, but what the \n[statute] says about it.”  Id.  The Supreme Court explained that the statute prohibited discrimination \nagainst individuals “based on sex.”  Id. at 1741.  The Supreme Court placed great significance on the \nfact that Title VII’s anti-discrimination provision was focused on individuals—it meant that the law \nwas focused on preventing employers from treating an “individual worse than others who are similarly \nsituated,” id. at 1740, and was not written so as to focus “on differential treatment between the two \nsexes as groups.”  Id. at 1741.  With that focus in mind, the Court concluded that “it is impossible to \ndiscriminate against a person for being [gay] or transgender without discriminating against that \nindividual based on sex.”  Id. \nLikewise, the FNA’s anti-discrimination language “focuses on protecting individuals from \ndiscrimination.”  May 5 Memo. at 2.  The Act “focuses on individual households . . . as opposed to \nprogram applicants as a whole,” id. at 2-3 (citing 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1)).  As USDA explained, “the \nfocus on individual households and the prohibition of discrimination ‘by reason of’ sex under the \n[FNA] is sufficiently similar to Title VII such that the Bostock analysis applies to the [FNA].”  Id. at 3.  \n29 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 40 of 51   PageID #: 360\n\n \nPlaintiffs have not identified any textual provision in the FNA that suggests otherwise.  \nInstead, they argue that “[e]ven if the Title VII reasoning of Bostock applied to [the FNA], [that law] \nwould merely prohibit denying certification [for SNAP beneficiaries] because a household member is \nhomosexual or transgender—a practice the States do not engage in”; it would “not prohibit States \nfrom maintaining sex-separated bathrooms or engaging in other non-certification practices that USDA \n. . . ha[s] apparently targeted.”  Br. at 17-18.  But neither the May 5 Memo nor the Final Rule bear on \nissues related to “maintaining sex separated bathrooms and locker rooms, offering sex-separated \nathletic teams, or using biologically accurate pronouns,” Br. at 19, and neither does the FNA.  Kline \nDecl. ¶¶ 8-9.  Plaintiffs have conjured up a fear of their own imagining, ignoring the reality of what \nthe May 5 Memo and Final Rule do and do not do.     \nD. Plaintiffs’ Arbitrary-and-Capricious Claim Is Unlikely to Succeed  \nPlaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious argument is likewise unfounded.  Br. at 12.  To the extent \nit is not duplicative of its notice-and-comment and contrary-to-law claims, addressed above, it rests \non the premise that “USDA intends to use the Final Rule or Memoranda as a mechanism to enforce \nits bathroom policy.”  Br. at 12.  But there is no mention of any such school-related policy in the Final \nRule or the May 5 Memo.  See Kline Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.   \nThe Final Rule and May 5 Memo clearly explain USDA’s rationale for interpreting Title IX \nand the FNA to include prohibitions on discrimination against individuals on the basis of their sexual \norientation or gender identity.  See May 5 Memo at 1-3; 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855-56. USDA’s reasoning \nfollows that of the Court in Bostock, and accounting for and employing the Supreme Court’s rationale \ncannot be arbitrary and capricious.  Cf. Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. HHS, 485 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. \n2020)  (finding  Title  IX  rule  arbitrary  and  capricious  where  agency  failed  to  consider Bostock’s \nreasoning); see generally FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (an agency need not \ndemonstrate “that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one,” but only \n30 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 41 of 51   PageID #: 361\n\n \nthat “the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the \nagency believes it to be better.”).   \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Assorted Constitutional Claims Are Unlikely to Succeed \nPlaintiffs also set forth a smorgasbord of constitutional arguments under the Spending Clause, \nthe  Tenth  Amendment,  the  First  Amendment,  and  various  doctrines  such  as  the  Anti-\nCommandeering Doctrine, the Non-Delegation Doctrine, and the Major Questions Doctrine.  All fail \nbecause USDA’s Final Rule and May 5 Memo are based on a straightforward interpretation of Title \nIX and the FNA as confirmed by the Supreme Court in Bostock. \n1.  Spending Clause \nThe Supreme Court has long acknowledged—and the Constitution expressly provides—that \n“Congress has authority under the Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys to promote the \ngeneral welfare” and “to see to it that taxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are in fact spent \nfor the general welfare.” Sabri v. United States, 541 U.S. 600, 605 (2004).  Congress’s power to impose \nconditions on the acceptance of federal funds applies regardless of whether Congress legislates “in an \narea historically of state concern.” Id. at 608 n.*. \n  Plaintiffs contend that they lacked constitutionally adequate notice of the Final Rule and May \n5 Memo, because neither of the statutes interpreted therein “unambiguously prohibit discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or transgender status.”  Br. at 19 (citing Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)).  This claim is meritless.  As the Supreme Court made clear in Bostock \nafter reviewing analogous language in Title VII, the “express terms of [the] . . . statute give us [the] . . \n. answer,” 140 S. Ct. at 1737, which is that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being \n[gay] or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”  140 S. Ct. at 1741.  \nThe Court noted that “Title VII’s broad language,” id. at 1747, encompassed other forms of \ndiscrimination,  including  “sexual  harassment”  and  “motherhood  discrimination,”  id.  (internal \n31 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 42 of 51   PageID #: 362\n\n \nquotation marks omitted), and generally “all forms of discrimination because of sex, however they \nmay manifest themselves or whatever labels might attach to them.”  Id.  It has been two years since \nthe Bostock decision was issued, and six years since the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Dodds v. Department of \nEducation, 845 F.3d 217, 221-22 (6th Cir. 2015) (per curiam), which found that Title IX prohibits \ndiscrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender nonconformity.  Plaintiffs cannot say that they \nlacked notice that USDA, which already conditions its SNAP and SNAP-Ed funding on compliance \nwith Title IX and the FNA, would inform states that compliance would need to be consistent with \nthe agency’s interpretation of those statutes in light of Bostock. \nPlaintiffs further argue that the Final Rule and May 5 Memo violate the Spending Clause in \nthat they are improperly coercive under Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 584 (2012) \n(“NFIB”).  In that case, the Supreme Court held that Congress could not make the entirety of a State’s \ntraditional Medicaid funding contingent on participation in a new program to provide health coverage \nfor all low-income adults.  But here, the Secretary is not “enlisting the States in a new . . . . care \nprogram.”  Id.  See Gruver v. La. Bd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. & Mech. Coll., 959 F.3d 178, \n184 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 901 (2020) (“The problem in NFIB was that Congress had \nconditioned all of a state’s Medicaid funding on accepting significant obligations that created a new \nprogram entirely different than the original one the state had opted in to.”); see also Tennessee v. U.S. \nDep’t of State, 329 F. Supp. 3d 597, 629 (W.D. Tenn. 2018), aff’d sub nom. State by & through Tenn. Gen. \nAssembly v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 931 F.3d 499 (6th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 549 (2020) (“The State \nmust also show that Congress has created a new condition that is different from the original program \nCongress is purporting to modify and is using that program’s funding as leverage to force the states \nto accept the new condition.”).  Here, the Secretary is simply applying the existing provisions of Title \nIX and the FNA to its longstanding nutrition programs, including SNAP and SNAP-Ed, based on an \ninterpretation of those statutes that has been recognized as valid under analogous circumstances in \n32 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 43 of 51   PageID #: 363\n\n \nBostock.  This does not constitute unlawful coercion under NFIB.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ Spending Clause \nclaim is not likely to succeed. \n2.  Tenth Amendment and Anticommandeering Doctrine \nBecause the USDA’s Final Rule and May 5 Memo are permissible under the Spending Clause, \nthey do not constitute an impermissible “commandeering” of state-run institutions.  As the Supreme \nCourt  has  explained,  valid  conditions  on  the  receipt  of  federal  funds  do  not  constitute \ncommandeering.  See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167, 173 (1992) (contrasting funding \nconditions with commandeering). \n3.  Separation of Powers and Non-Delegation Doctrine \nPlaintiffs further argue that USDA’s Final Rule and May 5 Memo violate the major questions \ndoctrine and the non-delegation doctrine.  Br. at 23-24.  Neither position has any merit.  This is not \none of those rare, extraordinary cases that raises the major questions doctrine.  See West Virginia v. \nEPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2608 (2022) (explaining that such cases are ones “in which the history and the \nbreadth of the authority that [the agency] has asserted, and the economic and political significance of \nthat assertion, provide a reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to confer such \nauthority” (citations omitted)).  USDA is not exercising any vast new authority to implement policies \nthat Congress could not have intended.  Congress clearly intended to prohibit sex discrimination \nagainst individuals under both Title IX and the FNA.  Even if the drafters “weren’t thinking about \nmany of the [statutes’] consequences, . . . the limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to \nignore the law’s demands.”  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1737.  The Supreme Court made clear in Bostock that \n“Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination in employment is a major piece of federal civil rights \nlitigation,” written in “starkly broad terms,” that encompasses conduct in which employers “fir[e] \nemployees on the basis of [sexual orientation] or transgender status.”  Id. at 1753 (emphasis added).  This \nwas why the Supreme Court found that opponents of this reading of Title VII could not “hide behind \n33 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 44 of 51   PageID #: 364\n\n \nthe no-elephants-in-mouseholes cannon,” id.; the expanse of the prohibition “has been standing \nbefore us all along.”  Id.  See also West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. at 2622 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(identifying the elephants-in-mouseholes canon as part of the major questions analysis).   \nThe States’ nondelegation doctrine challenge is equally deficient.  A “nondelegation inquiry \nalways begins (and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation.  The constitutional question is \nwhether Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion.”  Gundy \nv. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019).  “[T]he answer requires construing the challenged statute \nto figure out what task it delegates and what instructions it provides.”  Id.  Here, as in Bostock, “the \nexpress terms of [the statutes] give us one answer,” 140 S. Ct. at 1737, which is that administrators of \nUSDA-funded programs may not discriminate against individuals “on the basis of [sex, including. . \n.sexual orientation] or transgender status.”  Id. at 1753.  Nothing more is required under the \nnondelegation inquiry.    \n4.  First Amendment \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment arguments are unlikely to succeed because they are based on \nunsupported speculation.  For example, Plaintiffs contend that “USDA appears to have imposed the \nDepartment of Education’s position that the use of biologically accurate pronouns could constitute \nunlawful discrimination.”  Br. at 20.  But neither the Final Rule nor the May 5 Memo says anything of \nthe sort.  Plaintiffs suggest that such a position would violate the free speech rights of teachers and \nprofessors, citing, for example, Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3 492 (6th Cir. 2021).  But Meriwether \ninvolved an individual’s free speech rights, not a state’s, and USDA has not addressed pronoun usage \nin the challenged documents.  Nor does this case present the sort of fact-intensive dispute that was at \nissue in Meriwether.  USDA has not received a complaint, has not conducted any specific investigation, \nand has not made any determination that an individual’s use of incorrect pronouns constitutes \ndiscrimination.  This further underscores why Plaintiffs’ challenge is not ripe.  \n34 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 45 of 51   PageID #: 365\n\n \nNext, Plaintiffs inaccurately contend that the Final Rule and May 5 Memo conflict with \nreligious liberty guarantees under the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and \nfederal antidiscrimination laws.  Br. at 20-21.   Plaintiffs note that those authorities provide “robust \nprotections for religious employers and employees.”  Br. at 20.  But whatever those protections \nmaybe be, they do not belong to the States, and the States lacks standing to assert them on behalf of \nreligious employers and employees.  See, e.g., Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485–86 (1923) \n(“While the state, under some circumstances, may sue in that capacity for the protection of its \ncitizens, it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the \nfederal government.”); Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 597 (6th Cir. 2022) (same); New Mexico v. \nMcAleenan, 450 F. Supp. 3d 1130, 1208 (D.N.M. 2020) (noting general consensus “that the First \nAmendment works in one direction: it protects people and private entities, not governments”). \nMoreover, the States fail to acknowledge that Title IX and USDA’s own regulations contain a \nreligious exemption.  Since its enactment, Title IX has exempted educational institutions that are \ncontrolled by religious organizations from complying with Title IX’s prohibitions that conflict with its \nreligious tenets.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3).  Since April 1979, USDA’s Title IX regulations have made \nclear  that  they  do  “not  apply  to  an  educational  institution  which  is  controlled  by  a  religious \norganization to the extent application of this part would not be consistent with the religious tenets of \nsuch organization.”  See 44 Fed. Reg. 21,610, 21,613 (Apr. 11, 1979).  On October 6, 2017, USDA \nupdated its Title IX regulations but the language of the religious exemption in the new regulation, 7 \nC.F.R. § 15a.205, provides the same exemption for religious organizations as the 1979 language (“This \npart does not apply to any operation of an educational institution or other entity that is controlled by \na religious organization to the extent that application of this part would not be consistent with the \nreligious tenets of such organization.”).  See 82 Fed. Reg. 46,655, 46,659 (Oct. 6, 2017); 7 C.F.R. \n§ 15a.205(a).  The States do not identify any specific religious employer or employee who will be \n35 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 46 of 51   PageID #: 366\n\n \nharmed by the Final Rule or May 5 Memo, nor could they in light of these exemptions. \nFinally, the States argue that the USDA’s actions violate their own First Amendment rights.  \nBr. at 21.  But, of course, States do not have First Amendment rights.7  See Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc. v. \nDemocratic Nat’l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 139 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring); New Mexico v. McAleenan, 450 \nF. Supp. 3d at 1208. \nThe  First  Amendment  protects  the  rights  of  individuals  against  infringement  by  the \ngovernment, not the rights of States against the federal government.  That work is done by the Tenth \nAmendment, under which, as described above, the States’ arguments also fail. \nIII.    THE OTHER EQUITABLE FACTORS FAVOR DEFENDANTS \nA.  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Demonstrated  an  Irreparable  Harm  from  the  Denial  of \nInjunctive Relief \nPlaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to show that they will suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs have “the burden of establishing a clear case of \nirreparable injury,” Garlock, Inc. v. United Seal, Inc., 404 F.2d 256, 257 (6th Cir. 1968) (per curiam), and \ntheir burden to show irreparable harm is higher than what is required to establish standing.  See Ohio \nv. Yellen, 539 F. Supp. 3d 802, 820-21 (S.D. Ohio  2021).  To satisfy the “high standard” for establishing \nirreparable harm, Plaintiffs must show that their asserted injuries are “real,” “substantial,” and \n“immediate,” not speculative or conjectural.  City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983); see also \nMemphis A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, 978 F.3d 378, 391 (6th Cir. 2020).  And, as relevant here, \n“[a]n injunction against [even] threatened legal action will not issue if the party will have an adequate \nopportunity to fully present his defenses and objections in the legal action he seeks to enjoin.” Travis \nv. Pennyrile Rural Elec. Co-op., 399 F.2d 726, 729 (6th Cir. 1968); Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 217-18. \n \n7 Plaintiffs cite Walker v. Tex. Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U.S. 200 (2015), and Kennedy v. \nBremerton School District, 142 S. Ct. 2407 (2022).  Br. at 21.  Neither case is applicable here because \nthey did not address the constitutional rights of states.   \n36 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 47 of 51   PageID #: 367\n\n \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to preemptively enjoin USDA’s interpretations of Title IX and the FNA \nin the absence of any particular enforcement action.  Even if USDA were to bring an enforcement \naction under Title IX or the FNA against Plaintiffs consistent with the challenged interpretations—a \npossibility that seems highly speculative given that Plaintiffs disavow discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation and gender identity in relation to the USDA’s programs—Plaintiffs would have “an \nadequate opportunity to fully present [their] defenses and objections” in any such enforcement \nproceeding.  Id.  See supra at 7-9 (describing procedures).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot show \nirreparable harm in the absence of the injunction they seek.   \nPlaintiffs allege that their sovereign interests would be infringed if the Defendants were \npermitted to enforce their interpretations of Title IX and the FNA.  But, as discussed previously, \nPlaintiffs allege only that certain state laws may “arguably” conflict with Defendants’ interpretations \nof Title IX and the FNA.  Compl. ¶¶ 130-31; see also Br. at 8.  Particularly where they identify no \npending enforcement action against them, this is a far cry from the “certain and immediate” harm that \nwould merit a preliminary injunction.  Memphis A. Philip Randolph Inst., 978 F.3d at 391. \nB.  The Public Interest and Balance of the Equities Favor Defendants \nAn injunction is also improper because the balance of the equities and the public interest are \nin Defendants’ favor.  As a reminder, where the federal government is the defendant, these two factors \nmerge.  Daunt, 956 F.3d at 422.  Plaintiffs cannot establish that their alleged injury to their sovereignty \noutweighs any harm that an injunction would cause the government and unrepresented third parties, \nor that granting the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.  McNeilly v. Land, 684 F.3d \n611, 621 (6th Cir. 2012). \nThis is particularly so in light of the substantial public interest in achieving Title IX’s and the \nFNA’s goals of eliminating sex discrimination.  Indeed, the Plaintiffs themselves forswear such \ndiscrimination.  Violations of federal civil rights statutes constitute irreparable harm as a matter of law.  \n37 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 48 of 51   PageID #: 368\n\n \nSilver Sage Partners, Ltd. v. City of Desert Hot Springs, 251 F.3d 814, 827 (9th Cir. 2001); Roberts v. Colo. \nState Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 833 (10th Cir. 1993); Rogers v. Windmill Pointe Vill. Club Ass’n, 967 F.2d \n525, 528 (11th Cir. 1992).  An injunction prohibiting USDA from making clear that Title IX and the \nFNA prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity would have a severe \nimpact on a vulnerable population.  Dodds, 845 F.3d at 222 (holding that the public interest weighed \nheavily against a stay of an injunction where the injunction sought to protect a transgender student’s \nconstitutional and civil rights, “a purpose that is always in the public interest”).  Given that Plaintiffs \nare not in imminent danger of losing funds from USDA and have not shown how their state laws are \nimpacted by the Final Rule and May 5 Memo, they have not identified a sufficiently serious irreparable \nharm that would justify inflicting these injuries. \nC.  Any Injunctive Relief Should Be Limited  \nIf this Court were to enjoin any aspect of the challenged documents (and it should not), its \ninjunction should apply only to Plaintiffs, excluding those in the Fourth and Seventh Circuits where \nthe courts of appeals have already concluded that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sexual \norientation or gender identity.  Injunctions must be no broader than “necessary to provide complete \nrelief to the plaintiffs.”  Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (citation omitted); \nsee also Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 396 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, C.J., concurring) (criticizing \ninjunctions that apply beyond the parties to the suit).  This is particularly true in matters involving \ninjunctive relief against the federal government.  Id. (“[A] district court should think twice—and \nperhaps twice again—before granting universal anti-enforcement injunctions against the federal \ngovernment.”).  Accordingly, nonplaintiff States should not be subject to injunctive relief here. \nFurthermore, in the Fourth and Seventh Circuits that have held that Title IX precludes \ndiscrimination based on gender identity, it would be inappropriate for this Court to enjoin the federal \ngovernment from enforcing that view of the law. See, e.g., Grimm, 972 F.3d at 618-19; Whitaker by \n38 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 49 of 51   PageID #: 369\n\n \nWhitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1049 (7th Cir, 2017), abrogation \non other grounds as recognized by Ill. Rep. Party v. Prtizker, 973 F.3d 760 (7th Cir. 2020); see also United States \nv. AMC Ent., Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 773 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[p]rinciples of comity require that, once a sister \ncircuit has spoken to an issue, that pronouncement is the law of that geographical area”).  This would \ninclude Plaintiffs Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. \nCONCLUSION \nFor all these reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n   \n39 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 54   Filed 09/09/22   Page 50 of 51   PageID #: 370\n\n \nDated: September 9, 2022              Respectfully submitted, \n   \nBRIAN M.

Searching \nfor any possible avenue to effect radical social change, the Biden Administration, acting through \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), has announced multiple major revisions to the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”), a cooperative grant initiative that (among \nother  things)  helps  feed  children  in  need.    Each  of  USDA’s  new  rules  springs  from  the \nAdministration’s sweeping and erroneous conclusion that discrimination based on “sex” includes \ndiscrimination  based  on  “sexual  orientation”  and  “gender  identity”  in  every  setting—even \nelementary school classrooms and bathrooms.  To be clear, the States do not deny benefits based \non a household member’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  But they do challenge USDA’s \nradical regulatory changes that threaten to undermine the States’ management of their SNAP \nprograms.  Any State that refuses to go along risks losing millions in SNAP funding earmarked \nfor its most vulnerable residents.  \nThis  Court  recently  enjoined  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  from  enforcing  the \nguidance underlying USDA’s new rules, see Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., No. 3:21-cv-308, 2022 \nWL 2791450 (E.D. Tenn. July 15, 2022), and it should do so here as well.  Despite the potential \nof these rules to upend common-sense state laws, USDA declined to publicly vet its rules in any \nmeaningful way.  Instead, it rushed them out through a series of memoranda and a surprise final \nrule bearing little relation to the stale Proposed Rule it purports to codify.  USDA’s haste is evident:  \nIts edicts are procedurally deficient, substantively unlawful, and inadequately explained.  As soon \nas they take effect, USDA’s rules will interfere with the States’ sovereign regulatory authority, \nthreaten student and employee privacy, disrupt scholastic athletics, infringe on First Amendment \nrights, and impair state access to federal funding.  The States respectfully request a preliminary \ninjunction to protect them from those irreparable harms while this lawsuit is pending. \n1 \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 10 of 39   PageID #: 157\n\n \nBACKGROUND \nMere hours after his inauguration, President Biden directed federal agencies to implement \nhis  new  policy  of  “combat[ing]  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  gender  identity  or  sexual \norientation.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021).  With several of the \nresulting initiatives tied up in court, see Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *24 (granting States’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction and denying federal government’s motion to dismiss); Texas v. \nEEOC, No. 2:21-CV-194-Z (N.D. Tex. May 26, 2022) (denying federal government’s motion to \ndismiss), the Administration turned to USDA—specifically the SNAP program—to impose its \npolicies on state public schools.  \nSNAP  subsidizes  nutrition  for  “low-income  households”  through  cooperative  grant \nagreements  between  the  States  and  federal  government.    See  7  U.S.C.  §  2011;  7  C.F.R. \n§ 272.2(a)(2).  These Federal-State Agreements contain standardized language delineated by \nstatute and regulation.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2020(d)-(e); 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b).  A State’s refusal to agree \nto, or update, that language as USDA proscribes will result in the “withhold[ing]” of “such funds \n. . . as the Secretary [deems] appropriate.”  7 U.S.C. § 2020(g).  \nUSDA Memoranda.  USDA issued a series of memoranda imposing new requirements on \nStates.  First, USDA issued the memorandum that sets out its misreading of Bostock and directs \nStates and program operators to update their policies to reflect this change.  USDA, CRD 01-2022, \nApplication of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing – \nPolicy Update (May 5, 2022), https://bit.ly/3NuXnSx (“Memorandum”).  The Memorandum \n“adopts the Department of Justice’s and Department of Education’s analyses concluding that Title \nIX’s prohibition of sex discrimination includes a prohibition of discrimination on the basis of \ngender identity and sexual orientation.”  Memorandum at 2 (citing Dep’t of Justice (“DOJ”), \nMemorandum Regarding Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Title IX of the Education \n2 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 11 of 39   PageID #: 158\n\n \nAmendments of 1972 (Mar. 26, 2021), https://bit.ly/2WpV5zq (“DOJ Memorandum”); Dep’t of \nEduc.,  Enforcement  of  Title  IX  of  the  Education  Amendments  of  1972  with  Respect  to \nDiscrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021) (“Department of Education Interpretation”)).  USDA \nextends this interpretation to the Food and Nutrition Act.  Id. at 2-3. \nOnly when one reads the analyses that USDA adopted from the DOJ and the Department \nof Education—some of the very analyses that States are currently challenging in other lawsuits—\ndoes it become clear just how far USDA’s Memorandum apparently extends:  USDA even seems \nto have prohibited the States from operating sex-separated bathrooms. \nThe DOJ Memorandum relies primarily on two post-Bostock circuit court decisions where \ndivided panels held that a school district violated Title IX by using sex-separated bathrooms: \nGrimm v. Gloucester County School Board, 972 F.3d 586, 616 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. \n28, 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. 2878 (with Justices Thomas and Alito noting that they would have \ngranted the petition for writ of certiorari); and Adams v. School Board of St. Johns County \n(Adams I), 968 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir. 2020), vacated Title IX ruling (Adams II), 3 F.4th 1299 (11th \nCir. 2021), vacated in entirety (Adams III), 9 F.4th 1369 (11th Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Grimm and \nAdams I are directly contrary to what the DOJ Memorandum’s author, Pamela Karlan, told the \nSupreme  Court  during  oral  argument  in  Bostock:  that  sex  separated  bathrooms  are  “not \ndiscriminatory because” no one is “subjected to a disadvantage.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. at 12-13, Bostock \nv. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). \nThe now-enjoined Department of Education Interpretation that USDA adopted relies on \nthe same two opinions, which appears to signal that USDA understands Title IX and the Food and \nNutrition Act to prohibit States from maintaining sex-separated bathrooms.  See Department of \n3 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 12 of 39   PageID #: 159\n\n \nEducation Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,639.  A fact sheet issued almost simultaneously with \nthe Department of Education Interpretation shows the lengths that the Interpretation reaches to.  \nDOJ  &  Dep’t  of  Educ.,  Confronting  Anti-LGBTQI+  Harassment  in  Schools  (June  2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3sQjZnM (“Fact Sheet”).  According to the now-enjoined Fact Sheet, preventing a \ntransgender high school girl (a biological male) from “try[ing] out for the girls’ cheerleading team” \nwould likely constitute discrimination.  Fact Sheet at 1.  So would failing to use a transgender \nstudent’s preferred name or pronouns.  Id.  But Bostock addressed neither of those issues. \nSecond, the Cover Letter for the Memorandum stated that USDA’s new policy “applies to \nprohibitions against discrimination based on sex in all FNS programs,” recognizing that “these \nchanges may impact [State and local] operations.”  USDA, Cover Letter to CRD 01-2022, \nApplication of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing – \nPolicy Update (May 5, 2022) (“Cover Letter”) (Compl. Ex. B). \nThird, the questions and answers document attached to the Memorandum directs States to \nadopt the revised USDA Nondiscrimination Statement, a policy that apparently requires States and \nprogram operators to apply the new, expanded definition of sex discrimination to their entire \norganizational structure.  USDA, CRD 02-2022, Questions and Answers Related to CRD 01-2022 \nApplication of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing – \nPolicy Update (May 5. 2022), https://bit.ly/3yzKpyG (“Memorandum Q&A”); see also USDA, \nFood  &  Nutrition  Serv.  (“FNS”)  Nondiscrimination  Statement  (May  5,  2022), \nhttps://bit.ly/3nZTc6W  (“Nondiscrimination  Statement”).    Here,  USDA  requires  all  “State \nAgencies and [SNAP] program operators,” Memorandum Q&A at 1, to make the following \nattestation on various documents, websites, and in physical offices:  \nIn accordance with federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture \n(USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, this institution is prohibited from \n4 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 13 of 39   PageID #: 160\n\n \ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including gender \nidentity and sexual orientation), religious creed, disability, age, political beliefs, or \nreprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity. \nNondiscrimination Statement; see also Memorandum Q&A at 2.  The new Nondiscrimination \nStatement thus appears to apply the new policy to the entirety of any institution participating in a \nUSDA or SNAP program.  The States must adopt this new policy in short order. Tennessee, for \nexample, must adopt it by August 15, 2022, or risk losing over $6 million in SNAP Nutrition \nEducational Program funding for the next fiscal year.  Niknejad Decl., at ¶¶10-12 (attached as \nExhibit A).  And States must implement the complaint processing policy changes immediately or \nrisk loss of federal funding. Memorandum Q&A at 3. \nFourth, in a Supplemental Memorandum USDA sent on the same day, USDA purports to \ndirect States to update their posters and other materials with the revised Nondiscrimination \nStatement.  USDA, Memorandum Regarding Revised Nondiscrimination Statement and And \nJustice for All Posters; Timelines and Guidance for Implementation (May 5, 2022) (“Supplemental \nMemorandum”)  (Compl.  Ex.  D)  (collectively  with  the  Cover  Letter,  Memorandum,  and \nMemorandum Q&A, the “Memoranda”).  States must begin to comply within ninety days of the \nissuance of the Supplemental Memorandum on May 5, 2022.  USDA has already used these \nimminent deadlines and the threatened withdrawal of federal funds to pressure States such as \nAlaska to change how they operate SNAP.  Crum Decl., at ¶¶ 7-10 (attached as Exhibit B).   \nUSDA Final Rule.  To further codify its misapplication of Bostock, USDA then recycled \na long-dormant proposed rule originally filed one week after the 2016 Presidential election.  See \nSNAP: Civil Rights Update to the Federal-State Agreement, 81 Fed. Reg. 81,015 (Nov. 17, 2016) \nhttps://bit.ly/3aMNXVf  (“Proposed  Rule”).    The  Proposed  Rule  made  no  reference  to  the \nexpanded definition of sex discrimination.  And no one thought the rule made such a sweeping \npolicy change; the Proposed Rule only received five comments, none of which addressed sexual \n5 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 14 of 39   PageID #: 161\n\n \norientation or gender identity.  Comments to Proposed Rule, FNS-2016-0078-0002 to -0006, \n(posted Feb. 5, 2017), https://bit.ly/3v5Iv6Y.  Instead of going through the required administrative \nprocedures,  USDA  overhauled  the  long-dormant  Proposed  Rule  and  issued  a  final  rule. \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Civil Rights Update to the Federal-State Agreement, \n87 Fed. Reg. 35,855 (June 14, 2022), https://bit.ly/3bDC4RA (“Final Rule”).  \nThis newly recycled Final Rule requires States to adopt language in their SNAP Federal-\nState Agreements to “[c]omply with . . . Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. \n1681 et seq.) . . . to the effect that, no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex, \nincluding gender identity and sexual orientation, . . . be excluded from participation in, denied the \nbenefits of, or be otherwise subject to discrimination under SNAP.”  Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n35,857 (emphasis added).  USDA provided States with neither notice nor an opportunity to provide \npublic comment on the Final Rule’s expansion of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act.  Yet \nStates must adopt the Federal-State Agreement language by October 14, 2022.  \nOn June 14, 2022, a group of State Attorneys General led by Tennessee’s Attorney General \nHerbert H. Slatery III—and including all Plaintiff States—sent a letter to President Biden detailing \nthe procedural and substantive shortcomings in these agency actions.  Letter from Herbert H. \nSlatery III et al. to President Biden (June 14, 2022), https://bit.ly/3PpaWED.  The letter requested \nthat the Administration promptly withdraw the Final Rule and Memoranda.  Id. at 3.  The States \nreceived no response.  Because USDA declined to reconsider its regulatory actions, the Plaintiff \nStates have sued for declaratory and injunctive relief and now move for a preliminary injunction. \nARGUMENT \nThe Court has broad discretion to award a preliminary injunction, as guided by four factors: \n(1) whether the States appear likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether they will be irreparably \nharmed in the interim; (3) whether the injunction would harm USDA; and (4) whether the public \n6 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 15 of 39   PageID #: 162\n\n \ninterest favors such relief.  Vitolo v. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 360 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009)).  Each factor supports an injunction here. \nI.  The States Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nThe States will likely win this lawsuit.  This Court must set aside federal administrative \naction deemed arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Here, USDA used \nunlawful procedures to promulgate unlawful rules that infringe on various constitutional rights and \nstate prerogatives.  The States thus have strong, justiciable claims to ultimate relief. \nA.  The States Raise Justiciable Claims. \nThe States’ complaint asserts justiciable claims.  The challenged Memoranda and Final \nRule constitute final agency action, and the States have standing to challenge them.   \nFirst, USDA’s edicts constitute final agency action reviewable in federal court.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 704.  A “final” action “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” and \ncarries “legal consequences.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (quotation omitted). \nCourts take a “pragmatic” approach to analyzing finality, U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes \nCo., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1815 (2016) (quotation omitted), and that approach yields a clear result here. \nUSDA cannot dispute that its Final Rule—published in the Federal Register—qualifies as \nfinal action.  See Nat’l Ass’n of Mfrs. v. Dep’t of Def., 138 S. Ct. 617, 625-26 (2018).  The \nMemoranda are also final actions subject to judicial review under the APA because they purport \nto represent USDA’s definitive application of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act.  See, e.g., \nMemorandum at 2 (affirming that USDA has “evaluated the statutes it enforces and determined \nthat discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation can constitute prohibited sex \ndiscrimination  under  Title  IX and  the  Food and  Nutrition  Act”).   And  legal  consequences \nundoubtedly flow from the Memoranda: The States collectively risk the loss of over $28 billion if \nthey do not comply with the USDA’s directives to adopt new policies, binding contractual \n7 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 16 of 39   PageID #: 163\n\n \nlanguage, and enforcement procedures contained within the Memoranda.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2020(g); \ncf. Hawkes, 136 S. Ct. at 1815 (holding that the risk of “significant criminal and civil penalties” \nconstitutes “legal consequence”). \nSecond, the States have established “a substantial likelihood of standing.”  Memphis A. \nPhilip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, 978 F.3d 378, 386 (6th Cir. 2020) (quotation omitted).  The \nSupreme Court has made clear that when the federal government threatens enforcement of a law, \n“an actual . . . enforcement action is not a prerequisite to challenging the law.”  Susan B. Anthony \nList v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014).  The States can thus “satisf[y] the injury-in-fact \nrequirement” of standing by “alleg[ing] an intention to engage in” a proscribed “course of conduct” \nthat carries “a credible threat of prosecution.”  Id. at 159 (quotation omitted). \nThe States satisfy those requirements here, and easily so given the “special solicitude” to \nwhich they are “entitled.”  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007); see Texas v. United \nStates, 809 F.3d 134, 154 (5th Cir. 2015).  States, after all, have a sovereign interest in “the power \nto create and enforce a legal code.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 \nU.S. 592, 601 (1982).  The Final Rule and Memoranda intrude on the States’ ability to enforce \ntheir own legal codes because USDA has seemingly attempted to preempt numerous State laws \ngoverning public education.  See Compl. at ¶ 131 (compiling effected statutes); cf. Tennessee, 2022 \nWL 2791450, at *5-9 (ruling that States had standing to challenge EEOC and Department of \nEducation guidance for this reason).  \nThe challenged rules also injure the States by threatening over $28 billion in SNAP \nfunding, imposing compliance costs, disrupting logistical planning for the upcoming academic \nyear, and exposing them to potential damages liability.  The “loss of even a small amount of money \nis ordinarily an ‘injury’” for “standing purposes.” Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 137 S. Ct. \n8 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 17 of 39   PageID #: 164\n\n \n973, 983 (2017).  And that necessarily includes both the costs of complying with an unlawful rule, \nSch. Dist. Of Pontiac v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 261-62 (6th Cir. 2009) (en \nbanc) (plurality opinion), and the potential of punishment for noncompliance, see Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019).  Those injuries trace directly to USDA’s actions in this \ncase and can be redressed through a court order vacating the challenged rules. \nB.  USDA’s Rules Are Arbitrary, Capricious, and Unlawful. \nThe States are likely to succeed on their challenge to USDA’s Final Rule and Memoranda \nbecause  those  agency  actions  (1)  failed  to  satisfy  the  APA’s  procedural  requirements, \n(2) contradict both Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act, and (3) violate the U.S. Constitution. \n1.  USDA Failed to Follow Proper Rulemaking Procedures. \nThe APA generally requires agencies to engage in certain notice-and-comment procedures \nbefore issuing a rule that carries legal force.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)-(c); see also Perez v. Mortg. \nBankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) (summarizing procedures).  These procedures enable \nagencies “to get public input so as to get the wisest rules, to ensure fair treatment for persons to be \naffected by regulations, and to ensure that affected parties have an opportunity to participate in \nand influence agency decision making at an early stage.”  United States v. Utesch, 596 F.3d 302, \n308-09 (6th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted).  But, in its haste to rewrite federal antidiscrimination \nlaw, USDA has short-circuited the notice-and-comment process: The Final Rule addresses issues \nnot mentioned in the notice of proposed rulemaking—discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity and sexual orientation—and the Memoranda impose substantive rules on similar issues \nwith no notice at all.  Because USDA’s rules failed to meet the procedural requirements of the \nAPA, they are unlawful and should be set aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nFinal Rule.  USDA enacted its Final Rule without publishing a notice containing “either \nthe terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.”  \n9 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 18 of 39   PageID #: 165\n\n \nId. § 553(b)(3).  An agency’s final rule must be a “logical outgrowth” of its proposed rule.  Long \nIsland Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 174 (2007) (quotation omitted); see Leyse v. \nClear Channel Broad., Inc., 545 F. App’x 444, 453-54 (6th Cir. 2013).  A final rule qualifies as a \nlogical outgrowth “if interested parties should have anticipated that the change was possible, and \nthus reasonably should have filed their comments on the subject during the notice-and-comment \nperiod.”  Chesapeake Climate Action Network v. EPA, 952 F.3d 310, 319 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(quotation omitted).  By contrast, “[a] final rule fails the logical outgrowth test if interested parties \nwould have had to divine the agency’s unspoken thoughts, because the final rule was surprisingly \ndistant from the proposed rule.”  Id. at 319-20 (quotation omitted). \nHere,  the  Final  Rule  flunks  the  logical  outgrowth  test.    The  Final  Rule  adds \nantidiscrimination requirements based on gender identity and sexual orientation that USDA never \nmentioned in the previously published notice.  See Chesapeake Climate Action Network, 952 F.3d \nat 320.  Those requirements “eliminate, rather than retain, the status quo”—imposing new, \npreviously uncontemplated obligations on States.  District of Columbia. v. USDA, 496 F. Supp. 3d \n213, 231 (D.D.C. 2020) (cleaned up).  Unsurprisingly, USDA received no “comments with regard \nto” gender identity and sexual orientation “because the agency failed to give the public any inkling \nthat” these groups would be included in the rule when USDA conducted the comment process over \nfive years ago.  Id. (quotation omitted); see Mid Continent Nail Corp. v. United States, 846 F.3d \n1364, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Comments to Proposed Rule, FNS-2016-0078-0002 to -0006, (posted \nFeb. 5, 2017), https://bit.ly/3v5Iv6Y.  “The logical outgrowth doctrine does not extend to a final \nrule that finds no roots in the agency’s proposal because something is not a logical outgrowth of \nnothing.”  Env’t Integrity Project v. EPA, 425 F.3d 992, 996 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (cleaned up).  \nMemoranda.  USDA also attempted to circumvent fundamental administrative processes \n10 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 19 of 39   PageID #: 166\n\n \nwith its Memoranda.  “The APA sets different procedural requirements for ‘legislative rules’ and \n‘interpretive rules.’”  Tenn. Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 (6th Cir. 2018) (citing 5 \nU.S.C. § 553).  The analysis here turns on the substance of the documents, not what label USDA \nuses.  Detroit Edison Co. v. EPA, 496 F.2d 244, 249 (6th Cir. 1974).  A legislative rule “create[s] \nnew law, rights or duties,” whereas an interpretive rule sets out an interpretation that “only reminds \naffected parties of existing duties.”  Azar, 908 F.3d at 1042 (quotation omitted).  “[T]he former \nmust be promulgated pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking; the latter need not.”  Id. \nUSDA’s  Memoranda  qualify  as  legislative  rules.    They  “create[]  new  law,”  id.,  by \nimposing on regulated entities a new obligation not to discriminate on the basis of sexual \norientation or gender identity—an obligation that appears nowhere in Title IX or the Food and \nNutrition Act and that Bostock did not impose either.  The Memoranda also implement a number \nof duties and other “changes” that “impact [State] operations.”  Cover Letter at 1.  The State entities \n“must”  update  their  Nondiscrimination  Statement  on  websites,  documents,  pamphlets,  and \nbrochures.  Supplemental Memorandum at 1.  Moreover, “State Agencies and program operators \nwill have to update their program discrimination complaint processing procedures” and “will need \nto update their Nondiscrimination Statements.”  Memorandum Q&A at 2.  Given the USDA’s \n“mandatory language,” “there can be little doubt that” the Memoranda “purported to bind” the \nStates “with the force of law.”  Env’t Integrity Project, 425 F.3d at 998 (cleaned up); Memorandum \nQ&A at 2.  Not only that, as with many legislative rules, “failure to comply comes with the risk of \npenalties,” Mann Constr., Inc. v. United States, 27 F.4th 1138, 1143 (6th Cir. 2022)—like a \n“finding of noncompliance” that can lead to stripped federal funding, Memorandum Q&A at 3.  \nBecause the Memoranda impose legislative rules, the APA required USDA to give the \nStates and other interested parties “the chance to participate” in their promulgation.  United States \n11 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 20 of 39   PageID #: 167\n\n \nv. Cain, 583 F.3d 408, 420 (6th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  USDA did not do so, a clear \nviolation of the APA that warrants preliminary relief. \nArbitrary and Capricious.  Both the Final Rule and Memoranda are also “arbitrary” and \n“capricious.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  For one, a “decision made without adequate notice and \ncomment is arbitrary or an abuse of discretion” as a matter of law.  Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, \n279 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2002).  And, to the extent that USDA intends to use the Final Rule \nor Memoranda as a mechanism to enforce its bathroom policy and such, see supra pp. 3-4, the \nagency failed to “assess whether there were reliance interests, determine whether they were \nsignificant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy concerns.”  DHS v. Regents of \nthe Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915 (2020).  States have designed and constructed countless \nfacilities with separate bathrooms and locker rooms for men and women; had they known USDA \nwould eventually interpret Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act to prohibit discrimination based \non gender identity, they may have offered more single-occupant living facilities.  But USDA did \nnot consider these interests at all in enacting the rules at issue. \n2.  USDA’s Rules Run Counter to Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act. \nAdditionally, the Final Rule and Memoranda are substantively unlawful because they have \nno basis in the text, structure, or purpose of Title IX or the Food and Nutrition Act.  Bostock did \nnot address Title IX or the Food and Nutrition Act and therefore cannot support the Final Rule and \nMemoranda’s rewriting of those statutes.  Significant textual differences between those statutes \nand Title VII preclude the approach that the USDA has attempted to force on the States. \nUSDA cannot simply point to Bostock as justification for its new interpretation of Title IX \nand the Food and Nutrition Act.  As an initial matter, Bostock concerned only Title VII; it expressly \nnoted that “other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination”—like Title IX and the Food \nand Nutrition Act—were not before the Court, and refused to “prejudge any such question” about \n12 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 21 of 39   PageID #: 168\n\n \nwhat those statutes require.  140 S. Ct. at 1753.  Nor is Bostock’s analysis necessarily applicable \nto other statutes.  As the Sixth Circuit explained after Bostock, “Title VII differs from Title IX in \nimportant respects.”  Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021).  It therefore \n“does not follow that principles announced in the Title VII context automatically apply in the Title \nIX context.”  Id.; see also Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (“[T]he \nCourt in Bostock was clear on the narrow reach of its decision and how it was limited only to Title \nVII itself.”).  The same goes for the distribution of SNAP funds under the Food and Nutrition Act.  \nUSDA must justify its interpretation based on Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act themselves. \na)  The statutes contradict USDA’s new interpretation. \nThose two statutes, in fact, squarely contradict USDA’s reinterpretation in the Memoranda \nand Final Rule.  Title IX provides that no person “shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). USDA adopts \nan interpretation of that statute that seems to prohibit sex separated bathrooms and athletics.  But, \nas Meriwether emphasized, Title IX—unlike Title VII—also expressly authorizes separation based \non sex in certain circumstances.  992 F.3d at 510 n.4.  For example, it allows certain single-sex \neducational institutions and organizations.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1)-(9).  And it makes clear that \nTitle IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination does not prevent entities from “from maintaining \nseparate living facilities for the different sexes.”  Id. § 1686; see 118 Cong. Rec. 5,807 (1972) \n(statement of Sen. Bayh, the chief Senate sponsor of Title IX) (explaining that this protects \n“personal privacy”).  Thus, the text of § 1686 forecloses USDA’s reinterpretation of Title IX.  \nUSDA  “concurs  with  and  adopts”  the  Department  of  Education’s  now-enjoined \nInterpretation,  Memorandum  at  2,  but  ignores  the  Department  of  Education’s  regulations \n13 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 22 of 39   PageID #: 169\n\n \nimplementing Title IX’s clear statutory text.  For example, the Department of Education’s own \nregulations allow “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex” when the \n“facilities provided for students of one sex” are “comparable to such facilities provided for students \nof the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  Further, recipients may “operate or sponsor separate teams \nfor members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the \nactivity involved is a contact sport.”  Id. § 106.41(b).  Universities are even required to consider \nsex in allocating athletic scholarships.  Id. § 106.37(c); see Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 510 n.4.  These \nregulations underscore how Title IX acknowledges that “[p]hysical differences between men and \nwomen . . . are enduring.”  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (Ginsburg, J.).  The \n“two sexes are not fungible” but rather have “inherent differences.”  Id. (quotation omitted). \nAnd even if Title IX mirrored Title VII, USDA unlawfully attempts in the Final Rule and \nMemoranda to prohibit sex-separated facilities.  The DOJ—the other federal agency USDA defers \nto—concluded in early 2021 (before reversing course) that “Bostock does not require any changes \nto . . . sex-specific facilities or policies,” even under Title VII.  DOJ, Application of Bostock v. \nClayton County 4 (Jan. 17, 2021).  Sex-separated bathrooms are not “discrimination” because they \ndo not treat any employees “worse than others who are similarly situated.”  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at \n1740.  And the important interest in protecting privacy justifies separating living facilities based \non (biological) sex.  Cf. Brannum v. Overton Cnty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008); \nDoe  v.  Luzerne  Cnty.,  660  F.3d  169,  176-77  (3d  Cir.  2011).    While  “[a]n  individual’s \nhomosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions” about hiring and \nfiring, Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741 (emphasis added), sex is relevant to decisions about locker \nrooms, showers, and other contexts where biological differences between the two sexes matter.  \nNor can USDA’s interpretation be rooted in the term “sex.”  Despite USDA’s apparent \n14 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 23 of 39   PageID #: 170\n\n \ndisregard for biological differences between the two sexes, the Department of Education’s other \nanalyses have construed “sex” in Title IX as referring only to (biological) sex, not gender identity.  \nE.g., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026, 30,178 (May 19, 2020) (“Title IX and its implementing \nregulations include provisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification . . . .”).  That was the \nordinary meaning of “sex” when Title IX was enacted.  See Adams II, 3 F.4th at 1322 (W. Pryor, \nC.J., dissenting); Grimm, 972 F.3d at 632-33 (4th Cir. 2020) (Niemeyer, J., dissenting).  \nStatutory context confirms this binary understanding of “sex.”  For example, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a)(2) describes how an institution may change “from . . . admit[ting] only students of one \nsex to . . . admit[ting] students of both sexes.”  (Emphasis added).  And 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6)(B) \nrefers to ‘‘Men’s’’ and ‘‘Women’s’’ associations and organizations for ‘‘Boy[s]’’ and ‘‘Girl[s],’’ \n“the membership of which has traditionally been limited to persons of one sex.”  (Emphasis added); \ncf. 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,178 (“In promulgating regulations to implement Title IX, the Department \n[of Education] expressly acknowledged physiological differences between the male and female \nsexes.”).  Because Title IX expressly authorizes separation based on biological sex in myriad \ncontexts, including athletics and living facilities, USDA unlawfully adopted the Department of \nEducation’s now-enjoined rewriting of Title IX to prohibit covered entities from preventing an \nindividual of one sex from using facilities or competing on athletic teams designated for the other \nsex, or otherwise differentiating between the sexes in contexts where those differences matter.  \nUSDA correctly concludes that there is no reason to interpret the Food and Nutrition Act \ndifferently from Title IX, but that is because the term “sex” had the same binary biological meaning \nwhen Congress enacted the Food and Nutrition Act.  The very dictionary that USDA uses to define \nterms in that statute, see Memorandum at 2, defines “sex” as “either of the two major forms of \n15 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 24 of 39   PageID #: 171\n\n \nindividuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male \nespecially on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures,” Sex, Merriam-Webster (last \nvisited July 19, 2022), https://bit.ly/2K62Vm5.  \nb)  The use of “on the basis of sex” differs from the text of Title VII. \nEven if Title VII were to prohibit sex-separated bathrooms, athletics, and such—which it \ndoes not—the texts of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act differ from Title VII in a significant \nway: Title IX prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added), \nrather than “because of . . . sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).  The Food and Nutrition Act uses the \nsame “on the basis of . . . sex” language in the portion of the statute that sets the terms that a State \nmust ensure tribal organizations use in “the operation of the program,” which indicates “on the \nbasis of sex” is the relevant requirement.  7 U.S.C. § 2020(d).  \nThis distinction proves significant.  Bostock concluded that Title VII’s prohibition on \ndiscrimination “because of” sex imposed a but-for causation requirement, which “can be a \nsweeping standard.”  140 S. Ct. at 1739.  It followed from that standard that “if changing the \nemployee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer—a statutory violation has \noccurred,” even if the primary reason for the termination was the employee’s homosexual or \ntransgender status.   Id. at  1741-42 (“When an employer  fires an employee because she  is \nhomosexual or transgender, two causal factors may be in play—both the individual’s sex and \nsomething  else  (the  sex  to  which  the  individual  is  attracted  or  with  which  the  individual \nidentifies).”).  Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act, by contrast, prohibit only discrimination \n“on the basis of sex” in those provisions.  That makes clear that biological sex must be the sole \nreason for the discrimination.  “A statutory provision’s use of the definite article ‘the,’ . . . indicates \nthat Congress intended the term modified to have a singular referent.”  SEC v. KPMG LLP, 412 F. \n16 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 25 of 39   PageID #: 172\n\n \nSupp. 2d 349, 387-88 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); accord Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 434 (2004). \nc)  USDA’s justifications for its new interpretation fall short. \nAgainst all this, USDA’s attempts to justify its interpretation of Title IX and the Food and \nNutrition Act prove unavailing.  USDA begins by concluding that the texts of those two statutes \nare “sufficiently similar to the language in Title VII.”  Memorandum at 2; see Department of \nEducation Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,638.  As explained above, however, the two statutes, \nin fact, contain language materially different from that in Title VII.  The Department of Education, \nin the now-enjoined analysis USDA adopted, asserted that the Bostock opinion used “because of” \nand “on the basis of” interchangeably.  Id.  But “the language of an opinion is not always to be \nparsed as though” it were “the language of a statute.”  Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 341 \n(1979).  The dispositive question is what Congress intended.  And Congress’s use of different \nlanguage in Title IX and in 7 U.S.C. § 2020(d)—the provision of the Food and Nutrition Act that \nsets the terms that a State must ensure tribal organizations use in “the operation of the program”—\nindicates that it intended “to convey a different meaning.”  Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith \nInc. v. Manning, 578 U.S. 374, 398 (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). \nIt is true that 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1) states that “[i]n the certification of applicant households \nfor the supplemental nutrition assistance program, there shall be no discrimination by reason of \n. . . sex.”  (Emphasis added); see Memorandum at 2.  But that provision, at most, means that an \nagency cannot deny certification of an applicant household because of the household members’ \nsex.  Even if the Title VII reasoning of Bostock applied to this certification provision, 7 U.S.C. \n§ 2020(c)(1)  would  merely  prohibit  denying  certification  because  a  household  member  is \nhomosexual or transgender—a practice the States do not engage in.  Section 2020(c)(1), even \nunder that reading, would not prohibit  States from maintaining sex-separated bathrooms or \n17 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 26 of 39   PageID #: 173\n\n \nengaging in other non-certification practices that USDA, DOJ, and the Department of Education \nhave apparently targeted.  If anything, the “on the basis of” language in 7 U.S.C. § 2020(d) might \ninform a proper reading of 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1)’s “by reason of” language or, at least, restrict its \napplication outside the certification decision itself.  USDA’s own Nondiscrimination Statement \nuses “on the basis of . . . sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation).”  (Emphasis added); \nsee also Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857 (using “on the grounds of”). \nNext, USDA asserts that, like Title VII, the Food and Nutrition Act “focuses on protecting \nindividuals from discrimination.”  Memorandum at 2.  The adopted Department of Education \nInterpretation makes the same observation for Title IX.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,638.  True enough.  \nBut the relevant question is what constitutes prohibited discrimination under each statute.  Even if \nTitle VII had the same meaning as the two statutes USDA does enforce, Bostock expressly did not \n“purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”  140 S. Ct. at 1753. \nThe Department of Education Interpretation that USDA adopted for Title IX makes some \nadditional arguments.  But none overcomes the text of Title IX, and this Court has now enjoined \nthe Department of Education from enforcing its Interpretation because the Interpretation attempted \nto “create[] rights for students and obligations for regulated entities not to discriminate based on \nsexual orientation or gender identity that appear nowhere in Bostock, Title IX, or its implementing \nregulations.”  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21.  \nPlus, the Department of Education and DOJ analyses—adopted in USDA’s Memoranda—\nignore developments over the past year.  Adams I, one of the two circuit court opinions the agencies \nrelied upon, was initially replaced by a narrower decision that “d[id] not reach the Title IX \nquestion.”  Adams II, 3 F.4th at 1304.  The Eleventh Circuit then granted rehearing en banc and \nvacated even the narrower opinion.  Adams III, 9 F.4th at 1372.  That USDA neither acknowledged \n18 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 27 of 39   PageID #: 174\n\n \nthat development nor considered additional circuit court decisions distinguishing Title IX from \nTitle VII, such as Meriwether, shows that caselaw is not driving USDA’s rewriting of Title IX. \nUSDA may wish, as a policy matter, that Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act gave it \nauthority to prohibit States from maintaining sex-separated bathrooms and locker rooms, offering \nsex-separated athletic teams, or using biologically accurate pronouns.  But Congress gave USDA \nno such power.  USDA’s Final Rule and Memoranda, therefore, are contrary to law. \n3.  USDA’s Rules Violate the Constitution. \nUSDA’s Final Rule and Memoranda are also contrary to law because they violate the \nSpending Clause; First Amendment; Tenth Amendment and Anticommandeering Doctrine; and \nthe Separation of Powers and Non-Delegation Doctrine.  \nSpending Clause.  Congress enacted Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act pursuant to \nits Spending Clause authority.  “The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the spending \npower . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the contract.”  \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981) (quotation marks omitted).  If \n“Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys,” as it did under Title IX \nand the Food and Nutrition Act, “it must do so unambiguously.”  Id.  \nAs explained above, these two statutes do not unambiguously prohibit discrimination based \non sexual orientation or transgender status.  With Title IX, for example, the statute expressly allows \nsex-separated  facilities,  20  U.S.C.  §  1686,  undermining  the  very  foundation  of  USDA’s \ninterpretation.  Because Congress did not “provide[] clear notice to the States of their [purported] \nobligation” to treat individuals according to their gender identity rather than their (biological) sex, \nUSDA may not impose that obligation under the guise of a regulatory “interpretation.”  Sch. Dist. \nof Pontiac, 584 F.3d at 271 (plurality opinion) (citing Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. \nMurphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006)).  \n19 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 28 of 39   PageID #: 175\n\n \nThe Final Rule and Memoranda violate the Spending Clause for an additional reason: they \nuse the threat of withholding substantial federal funding to coerce States into adopting USDA’s \npreferred policies.  Crum Decl., at ¶¶ 8-10.  Threatening to withhold a State’s federal funding if it \nfails to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity (a requirement that \nappears nowhere in Title IX or the Food and Nutrition Act) “is much more than ‘relatively mild \nencouragement’—it is a gun to the head.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, \n581 (2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.) (quoting South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987)).  \nFirst Amendment.  The Final Rule and Memoranda also appear to violate the First \nAmendment in at least three ways.  First, by adopting the Department of Education’s analyses and \nrequiring States to affirm that their institutions will not discriminate on the basis of gender identity \nor sexual orientation, Memorandum at 2, USDA appears to have imposed the Department of \nEducation’s position that the use of biologically accurate pronouns could constitute unlawful \ndiscrimination.  That runs headlong into the First Amendment.  In Meriwether, the Sixth Circuit \nheld that a state university “flouted” the First Amendment and “violated [a professor’s] free-speech \nrights” by punishing the professor for declining to use a student’s “preferred pronouns.”  992 F.3d \nat 511-12; cf. United States v. Varner, 948 F.3d 250, 256-57 (5th Cir. 2020) (denying motion to \nrequire use of a transgender litigant’s preferred pronouns and noting the wide variety of preferred \npronouns).  Even at the high school level, teachers retain some First Amendment free-speech \nrights.  See Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2423 (2022). \nSecond, the Final Rule and Memoranda also conflict with religious liberty.  Bostock \nemphasized that the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and federal \nantidiscrimination laws all provide robust protections for religious employers and employees.  140 \nS. Ct. at 1754.  USDA did not even acknowledge in the Final Rule the potential conflict between \n20 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 29 of 39   PageID #: 176\n\n \nits interpretation of the statutes and the religious-freedom rights of the entities and individuals that \nthe statutes regulate.  That conflict provides an additional reason to set aside the unlawful actions.  \nCongress’s spending power “may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities \nthat would themselves be unconstitutional.”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 210.  By threatening to withhold \nfunds  from  States  unless  they  adopt  policies  or  engage  in  conduct  that,  at  least  in  some \ncircumstances, would violate the First Amendment rights of their students and employees, the \nFinal Rule and Memoranda impose unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of federal funds.  \nThird, the USDA’s actions violate the First Amendment rights of States.  Plaintiff States \nhave First Amendment rights, which include the right not to express messages they do not want to \nexpress.  See Walker v. Tex. Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U.S. 200, 219-20 (2015).  \n“[T]eachers and coaches are also government employees paid in part to speak on the government’s \nbehalf and convey its intended messages.”  Kennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2423.  Yet the Final Rule and \nMemoranda seek to dictate the messages that the States convey to students and the public through \nState employees.  USDA requires States to broadcast in revised policies, posters, and websites that \ntheir institutions do not discriminate on the basis not just of sex—what the States agreed to when \nthey accepted federal funding—but also on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.  \nWhat is particularly troubling about this infringement of the First Amendment is that free \nspeech rights are supposed to be strongest regarding speech on controversial topics, which surely \ninclude sexual orientation and gender identity.  See Bongo Prods., LLC v. Lawrence, No. 3:21-cv-\n00490, 2022 WL 1557664, at *1, 16-17 (M.D. Tenn. May 17, 2022).  For example, “[w]hether to \nuse an individual’s preferred pronouns, rather than those consonant with one’s biological sex, \npresents ontological and moral questions about our identity as human beings.”  In re C.G., 2022 \nWI 60, ¶ 99 (Hagedorn, J., concurring in denial of transgender sex offender’s request to legally \n21 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 30 of 39   PageID #: 177\n\n \nchange name).  Related policy questions are best resolved at the State level, not in hastily issued \npronouncements from USDA.  If anything, forcing States to propagate the USDA’s biologically \ninaccurate moral dogma in public schools seems to do exactly what the Supreme Court has \npreviously prevented States from doing—“require that teaching and learning must be tailored to \nthe principles or prohibitions of” a biologically inaccurate “dogma.”  See Epperson v. Arkansas, \n393 U.S. 97, 106 (1968) (prohibiting restrictions on the teaching of evolution).   \nTenth  Amendment  and  Anticommandeering  Doctrine.    USDA’s  Final  Rule  and \nMemoranda  also  violate  structural  constitutional  safeguards  in  the  Tenth  Amendment  and \nAnticommandeering  Doctrine  and  thus  are  “not  in  accordance  with  law,”  “contrary  to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C).  Congress must make “clear and manifest” \nits purpose to supersede powers historically reserved to the States, such as the management of their \npublic schools.  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).  “It is one of the happy \nincidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a \nlaboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”  \nChandler v. Florida, 449 U.S. 560, 579 (1981) (quoting New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. \n262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).  USDA turns that federalism principle on its head.  \nAccording to USDA, one courageous federal entity may, if its bureaucrats choose, risk the entire \ncountry as a laboratory for novel social experiments. \nIn carrying out its social experiment, USDA errs as well by commandeering States and \ntheir employees.  The Tenth Amendment and structure of the Constitution deprive Congress of \n“the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States,” Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. \n1461, 1476 (2018), and forbid the federal government from commandeering state officers “into \n22 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 31 of 39   PageID #: 178\n\n \nadministering federal law,” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 928 (1997).  But the Final Rule \nand Memoranda apparently commandeer States and their employees into rewriting policies, \nreplacing posters, updating websites, and affirming non-discrimination policies that would require \nreorganizing athletic programs and living facilities to avoid all distinctions between the two sexes. \nSeparation  of  Powers  and  Non-Delegation  Doctrine.    USDA’s  Final  Rule  and \nMemoranda are also contrary to law and exceed statutory authority because they stray so far \nbeyond any reasonable reading of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act that they amount to an \nunconstitutional exercise of legislative power.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 1 (“All legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in . . . Congress.”).  Congress must “speak clearly when authorizing \nan agency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors \nv. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (quotation omitted); see West \nVirginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2607-10 (2022).  And when Congress does delegate power, that \ndelegation comports with the Constitution only if “Congress lays down by legislative act an \nintelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is \ndirected to conform.”  Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019) (cleaned up).   \nHere, Congress neither spoke clearly to authorize USDA to resolve such a major question \nas whether States may maintain sex-separated athletic programs, bathrooms, and locker rooms nor \nprovided an intelligible principle by which USDA could redefine “on the basis of sex” in Title IX \nand the Food and Nutrition Act.  Congress must offer “specific restrictions” that “meaningfully \nconstrain[]” the agency’s exercise of authority.  Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 166-67 \n(1991).  If USDA really had the power to rewrite Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act in a way \nthat makes something as commonplace as sex-separated bathrooms illegal, then there would be no \nmeaningful constraint on USDA’s discretion.  Such a decision of “deep . . . political significance” \n23 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 32 of 39   PageID #: 179\n\n \nmust be made by Congress.  King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015) (quotation marks omitted). \nII.  The States Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent a Preliminary Injunction. \nAbsent a preliminary injunction, USDA’s new Final Rule and Memoranda will irreparably \nharm the States.  The rules present the States with a Hobson’s choice: either forfeit sovereign \nprerogatives or give up critical funds used to educate students and feed families in need.  Either \npath leads to an imminent, unrecoverable loss that justifies equitable relief. \nUnder our Constitution, “[t]he States possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the \nFederal Government, subject only to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.”  Hill v. \nCurtin, 792 F.3d 670, 675 (6th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (quoting Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. 12, 19 \n(2013)).  “Paramount among the States’ retained sovereign powers is the power to enact and \nenforce any laws that do not conflict with federal law.”  Cameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Ctr., \nP.S.C., 142 S. Ct. 1002, 1011 (2022).  And a State necessarily “suffers a form of irreparable injury” \nany time it is prevented from “effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people.”  \nThompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 619 (6th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). \nMoreover, like private parties, “States generally cannot collect money damages from the \nfederal government under the APA.”  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing \n5 U.S.C. § 702).  The costs of complying with an unlawful regulation, and lost revenues linked to \nits violation, qualify as “irreparable harm[s]” in this unique context.  Id.; see BST Holdings, L.L.C. \nv. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604, 618 (5th Cir. 2021); New York v. DHS, 969 F.3d 42, 86 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nIf USDA’s Final Rule and Memoranda take effect while this lawsuit remains pending, they \nwill force the States to choose between their sovereignty and education and lunch money for \nchildren.  Tennessee, for example, requires that “[a] student’s gender for purposes of participation \nin” middle and high school sports “must be determined by the student’s sex at the time of . . . \nbirth,” not their later-chosen gender identity.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-6-310.  Tennessee has also \n24 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 33 of 39   PageID #: 180\n\n \ngranted a private right of action against public schools that “intentionally allow[s] a member of \nthe opposite sex to enter [a] multi-occupancy restroom or changing facility while other persons \n[are] present.”  Id. § 49-2-805.  Further, Tennessee guarantees that “no faculty” at any state-run \ncollege “will face adverse employment action for classroom speech,” including the refusal to use \nbiologically inaccurate pronouns.  Id. § 49-7-2405(a)(10).  These acts, which regulate Tennessee’s \nown institutions, fall within the State’s traditional sovereign purview.  But if the Administration \ndeems them a form of “discrimination . . . under SNAP,” Final Rule at 35,857, it will cause \nirreparable harm.  Tennessee would have to disregard State law or else risk a “finding of \nnoncompliance,” Memorandum Q&A at 3, and withholding of SNAP funds “as the Secretary \ndetermines to be appropriate,” 7 U.S.C. § 2020(g); see also Final Rule at 35,857-58.  Neither \nsacrifice is reversible through a final judgment that will come months, if not years, from now. \nIII.  The Equities and Public Interest Favor Preliminary Relief. \nAll remaining considerations favor preliminary relief.  Federal courts generally weigh the \npotential harm to the defendant and the public interest before issuing a preliminary injunction.  See \nCity of Pontiac Retired Emps. Ass’n v. Schimmel, 751 F.3d 427, 430 (6th Cir. 2014) (en banc).  \nBut when the injunction would run against the federal government, “[t]hese factors merge,” Nken, \n556 U.S. at 435, and typically turn on a lawsuit’s merit.  Indeed, when a “plaintiff shows a \nsubstantial likelihood” that government action will be deemed unlawful, “no substantial harm to \nothers can be said to inhere in its enjoinment.”  Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov’t, 274 \nF.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. 2001).  That is the case here.  The States seek to maintain the status quo \nand prevent the unlawful new rules from disrupting state-run schools and other state agencies. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should enjoin USDA from implementing its Final Rule and Memoranda against \nthe Plaintiff States (and entities within those States) while this action remains pending \n25 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 3   Filed 07/26/22   Page 34 of 39   PageID #: 181\n\nDated: July 26, 2022         \nRespectfully Submitted,  \n \n/s/ Brandon J.

Those documents \nserved to advise stakeholders of USDA’s understanding that the sex-discrimination prohibitions in \nthe Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended (FNA) and Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 (Title IX) include prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and \ngender identity.  USDA’s understanding is grounded in the reasoning of Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. \nCt. 1731 (2020), in which the Supreme Court found a similar prohibition on sex discrimination \nunambiguously precludes discrimination “simply for being [gay] or transgender.” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at \n1737.  Plaintiffs filed this suit just before the start of the current academic year, alleging that USDA’s \ninterpretive documents would disrupt planning for the school year, threaten state fiscs, and preempt \nstate law.  Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed. \nAs a threshold matter, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.  Memorializing the \nalready-extant requirements of the FNA and Title IX in advisory materials imposed no harms on \nPlaintiffs, who maintain that they do not “deny benefits based on a household member’s sexual \norientation or gender identity,” Compl. ¶ 12, ECF No.1, and who would remain subject to the \nprohibitions on sex discrimination contained in Title IX and the FNA even in the absence of the \ninterpretive documents that Plaintiffs challenge.  Additionally, though Plaintiffs seek pre-enforcement \nreview of USDA’s interpretative documents, they do not plausibly allege any pending or foreseeable \nenforcement action by USDA.  Moreover, Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege the sort of harms that would \n1 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 8 of 33   PageID #: 680\n\nafford them standing to bring a claim for pre-enforcement review.  And Plaintiffs’ allegations of harm \nto their sovereignty and funding streams from USDA are not concrete, traceable to USDA, or \nredressable by this Court.  For similar reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe.  Finally, the Court also \nlacks jurisdiction because Plaintiffs could bring these claims as defenses in any enforcement action, \nand because both Title IX and the FNA provide comprehensive enforcement schemes that preclude \ndistrict court jurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges to the application of those statutes under \nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994).  \nEven if this Court had jurisdiction, Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed for lack of merit.  \nThe May 5 Memo concerning the processing of discrimination complaints filed in connection with \nUSDA’s SNAP program is an interpretive rule and does not constitute final agency action reviewable \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  The June 14 Final Rule was promulgated consistent \nwith the APA.  Neither document is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, as they hew closely to the \nreasoning of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock in aligning USDA’s interpretation of virtually \nidentical language across Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq., Title IX, and the FNA.  And neither \ndocument runs afoul of the various constitutional provisions and principles that Plaintiffs invoke.   \nFor these reasons, which supplement all those already stated in Defendants’ brief in opposition \nto Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  THE ADMINISTRATION OF SNAP AND SNAP-ED \nUSDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers the nutrition assistance programs of \nUSDA.  Decl. of Angela Kline ¶ 4 (“Kline Decl.”), ECF No. 54-1.  The largest nutrition assistance \nprogram FNS administers is SNAP, id. ¶ 5, which “safeguard[s] the health and well-being of the \nNation’s population by raising the levels of nutrition among low-income households,” 7 U.S.C. § 2011.  \nCongress limited participation in SNAP to “those households whose incomes and other financial \n2 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 9 of 33   PageID #: 681\n\nresources . . . are determined to be a substantial limiting factor in permitting them to obtain a more \nnutritious diet,” id. § 2014(a), and required the Secretary of Agriculture to establish “uniform national \nstandards of eligibility,” id. § 2014(b).  The Secretary issued regulations establishing eligibility standards \nbased on household income and assets, see 7 C.F.R. Part 273 (standards); none includes sex-based \nconsiderations, and “no State agency [may] impose any other standards of eligibility as a condition for \nparticipating in the program,” 7 U.S.C. § 2014(b).  Accordingly, States are prohibited from considering \na person’s gender identity or sexual orientation for purposes of SNAP and SNAP-Ed eligibility and \nparticipation.  See 7 C.F.R. Part 273; 7 U.S.C. § 2014(b). \nThe SNAP program provides federal funds to purchase food from authorized retailers (e.g., \ngrocery stores).  Kline Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7.  Schools do not participate in SNAP as authorized retailers, and \nschool meals are not eligible food for purposes of SNAP.  See id. ¶ 7 (citing 7 U.S.C. § 2012(k)).   \nFNS also administers SNAP-Ed, a much smaller program which provides nutrition education \nin a wide variety of settings and for diverse audiences.  See id. ¶ 9.  Unlike SNAP, SNAP-Ed is a grant \nprogram and does not distribute funds to individuals or other direct benefits to program participants.  \nId. ¶ 9.  Although schools may be implementing agencies or sites for the SNAP-Ed program, FNS’s \nrole in relation to the schools is limited strictly to SNAP-ED’s nutrition and education purposes and \nto ensuring that eligible individuals have access to the program.  Id.  Neither SNAP nor SNAP-Ed \nrelates to the regulation of bathrooms, locker rooms, athletics, dress codes, or other areas identified \nin Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  Id. ¶¶ 8-9. \nAlthough USDA funds and oversees SNAP, it is administered in partnership with state \nagencies.  Id. ¶ 6.  To participate in SNAP, state agencies must submit a State Plan of Operation, which \nincludes a Federal/State Agreement (“FSA”).  Id. ¶ 10.  The FSA is the legal agreement through which \nstates agree to administer SNAP in accordance with the FNA, the Act’s associated regulations, and \nthe FNS-approved State Plan of Operation.  Id. ¶ 11 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 272(a)(2)).  The FSA contains \n3 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 10 of 33   PageID #: 682\n\nstandard nondiscrimination language set forth by regulation, see 7 C.F.R. § 272(b)(1), but a State may \n“propose alternative language to any or all the provisions,” id. § 272(b)(2); see also Kline Decl. ¶ 14.  \nAny proposed alternative language must be approved by both parties.  Id. \nII.  THE UPDATE OF STANDARD FSA LANGUAGE BASED ON BOSTOCK \nFrom time to time, USDA updates the standard language proposed for SNAP FSAs.  USDA \nbegan to do so in late 2016 by publishing a proposed rule in the Federal Register.  See 81 Fed. Reg. \n81,015-01 (Nov. 17, 2016) (“Proposed Rule”).  Among other topics, the Proposed Rule addressed the \nstandard non-discrimination language in FSAs.  Id.  USDA proposed modifying the standard language \nto “incorporate references to additional civil rights legislation,” including references to Title IX, the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act, and certain parts of the Americans with Disabilities Act, to \n“codify protections already required by Federal law, regulations and existing policy.” Id. at 81,015. \nFollowing the comment period, USDA published its Final Rule on June 14, 2022.  See 87 Fed. \nReg. 35,855.  The Final Rule updated standard FSA non-discrimination language to include, among \nother things, an assurance that a state receiving SNAP funds would comply with Title IX.  Id. at 35,857.  \nThe Final Rule also made clear that “gender identity and sexual orientation” discrimination are forms \nof discrimination on the basis of sex.  See id. at 35,857.  The Final Rule stated that the updated non-\ndiscrimination language would “codify protections already required by Federal law and existing \npolicy.”  Id. at 35,855.  Under the Final Rule, states retained the option, “[i]f [they did] . . . not wish to \nsign the FSA with the language as written in 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b)(1),” to “‘propose alternative language \nto any or all the provisions.’”  Kline Decl. ¶ 14 (quoting 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b)(2)).   \nThe Final Rule became effective as of August 15, 2022, and provided, consistent with 7 C.F.R. \n§ 272.2(e)(1), that each participating state must sign and submit a new SNAP FSA to FNS by \nDecember 15, 2022.  Id. ¶ 13.  Once signed, the SNAP FSA is valid until terminated.  Id.  In the \ninterim, the state’s currently effective FSAs remain in place.  Id. \n4 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 11 of 33   PageID #: 683\n\nAs of December 5, 2022, seventeen Plaintiff-States (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, \nKansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Missouri,  Montana,  Nebraska,  Ohio,  Oklahoma,  South  Carolina, \nTennessee, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia) have finalized their new SNAP FSA, adopting the exact \nlanguage promulgated in the Final Rule.  Id. ¶ 15 & Exs. 2-15.  The remaining five Plaintiff-States \n(Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, South Dakota, and Texas) do not yet have fully executed SNAP FSAs.  \nState agencies wishing to participate in SNAP-Ed were required to submit their State Plans of \nOperation by August 15.  Kline Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. 1.  All the Plaintiffs did so, and all were allocated \nSNAP-Ed funds for Federal Fiscal Year 2023.  Id.   \nIII.  USDA’S ENFORCEMENT OF NON-DISCRIMINATION REQUIREMENTS \nA.  Enforcement of SNAP FSAs and the FNA \nIn the hypothetical event a state agency contravenes the assurances in its SNAP FSA, \nnumerous steps need to occur before FNS can bring an enforcement action.  See 7 U.S.C. §§ 2020(g), \n2023; 7 C.F.R. §§ 276.4, 276.7; Kline Decl. ¶ 17.  The state agency must first receive written notice of \na potential action that provides time to remedy the deficiency.  Kline Decl. ¶ 17 (citing 7 C.F.R. \n§ 276.4(d)(1)).  Failure to remedy the deficiency within the time allowed results in a formal warning \nabout possible suspension and/or disallowance of federal funds.  Id. (citing 7 C.F.R. § 276.4(d)(2)).  \nThe state agency would then have thirty days to submit either (a) evidence that it complied with the \nFSA,  or  (b) a  corrective  action  plan  for  bringing  itself  into  compliance.    Id.  (citing  7  C.F.R. \n§ 276.4(d)(2)).  SNAP funds may be suspended or disallowed only if the state agency were to fail to \nrespond to the formal complaint, submit insufficient evidence of compliance or an unsatisfactory \ncorrective action plan, or disregard an agreed-upon corrective action plan.  Id. (citing 7 C.F.R. \n§ 276.4(e).  Disallowance of SNAP funds may be appealed to the SNAP Appeals Board, and the \nBoard’s decision is subject to judicial review.  Id. ¶ 18 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 276.7). \n5 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 12 of 33   PageID #: 684\n\nThe Final Rule did not change the manner in which FNS enforces prohibitions against sex \ndiscrimination in SNAP or SNAP-Ed.  States could not consider gender identity or sexual orientation \nfor purposes of SNAP and SNAP-Ed eligibility and participation before the Final Rule was adopted, \nsee 7 C.F.R. Part 273; 7 U.S.C. § 2014(b), so even absent the Final Rule, FNS would be able to pursue \nsuspension or disallowance of funds to remedy discrimination.  Kline Decl. ¶ 16.  \nB.  Enforcement of Title IX and Other Civil Rights Laws \nBeyond SNAP-specific enforcement mechanisms under the FNA, USDA also may pursue \nremedies for violations of specific civil rights laws in relation to programs receiving USDA funds.  See \n20 U.S.C. §§ 1682-1683; 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; see also Decl. of Roberto Contreras ¶¶ 12-29 (“Contreras \nDecl.”), ECF No. 54-2.  USDA’s internal regulations require USDA employees to ensure programs \nand activities receiving federal financial assistance from USDA are in compliance with applicable civil \nrights laws.  See Contreras Decl. ¶ 12.  When USDA receives a complaint of a violation of civil rights \nlaws in a program or activity receiving USDA funds and determines that it has jurisdiction, it notifies \nthe complainant that USDA has accepted the complaint.  Id. ¶¶ 16-20.  USDA then “attempts to \nresolve the complaint at the lowest possible level through alternative dispute resolution.”  Id. ¶ 22.  In \nthe event those attempts are unsuccessful, USDA will assign an investigator, who compiles sworn \nstatements and documents relating to the issues in the complaint.  Id.  Based on the investigation, \nUSDA decides whether the recipient of federal funds has violated relevant civil rights laws.  Id.  If the \nrecipient is found to be out of compliance, USDA seeks voluntary compliance.  Id. ¶ 24-25.  If the \nrecipient does not comply voluntarily, the complaint may then be referred to USDA’s Office of the \nAssistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) for further action pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 15.8.  Contreras \nDecl. ¶ 25.  Only after completion of all of these steps might USDA refer the matter to the Department \nof Justice to pursue judicial remedies for unlawful discrimination.  See id. ¶¶ 25-28.  \n6 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 13 of 33   PageID #: 685\n\nIV.  THE MAY 5 MEMO ON DISCRIMINATION-COMPLAINT PROCESSING \nOn January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that instructed federal agencies \nto evaluate statutes and regulations prohibiting sex discrimination in light of Bostock v. Clayton County, \n140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).  See Executive Order 13988, “Preventing and Combating Discrimination on \nthe Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation,” 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).  In Bostock, \nthe Supreme Court held that Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because of sex” included \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity because “[sexual orientation] and \ntransgender status are inextricably bound up with sex.”  140 S. Ct. at 1737, 1741–42.  In response to \nthe Executive Order, USDA re-examined the non-discrimination provisions governing USDA-funded \nprograms.   \nOn May 5, 2022, following that re-examination, USDA issued a memorandum to the state and \nregional directors of FNS programs laying out USDA’s interpretation of the non-discrimination \nprovisions of Title IX and the FNA based on Bostock.  See May 5 Memo, ECF No. 1-1.  In it, USDA \nconcurred  with  the  Departments  of  Justice  and  Education  that  Title  VII’s  prohibition  of \ndiscrimination “because of sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), and Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination \n“on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1618(a), were sufficiently similar that Bostock’s interpretation should \napply to Title IX.  See May 5 Memo at 2-3.  USDA likewise indicated the FNA’s non-discrimination \nprovision—prohibiting discrimination “by reason of … sex,” 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1)—was so similar \nto Title VII’s language that it too was governed by Bostock.  The May 5 Memo therefore advised “[s]tate \nagencies and program operators . . . [to] review their program discrimination complaint procedures \nand make any changes necessary to ensure complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity and sexual orientation are processed and evaluated as complaints of discrimination on the \nbasis of sex.”  May 5 Memo at 3.  Though the May 5 Memo set out USDA’s understanding of Title \nIX and the FNA, USDA made clear that the Memo “does not determine the outcome in any particular \n7 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 14 of 33   PageID #: 686\n\ncase, which will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of that case,” and that it did not \naddress other “legal requirements, including, . . . Title IX’s religious exemption, the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act . . . and any other applicable exemptions.”  Id. \nOn the same day, USDA issued two related documents.  One document answers anticipated \nquestions about the Memo, including questions about the updating and placement of “And Justice for \nAll” posters used in FNS-funded programs.  See Q&A Memo, ECF No. 1-3.  The second document \nadvises state agencies on the process of updating non-discrimination statements in their public-facing \nmaterials to comport with the May 5 Memo.  See May 5 Memo Supplement, ECF No. 1-4.  Neither \nthe Q&A Memo nor the May 5 Memo Supplement purports to have any independent legal effect. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs filed their Complaint on July 26, 2022, alleging that USDA, in issuing the May 5 \nMemo and the Final Rule, violated the APA and assorted provisions of the Constitution.  See generally \nCompl.  Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction the same day, requesting preliminary injunctive \nrelief and seeking expedited consideration of the Motion.  Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 3, ECF No. 2.  The \nCourt sua sponte denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited briefing.  See Tennessee v. USDA, No. 3:22-cv-\n257, 2022 WL 5336196 (E.D. Tenn. Aug. 10, 2022).  In its order, the Court noted that “Plaintiffs \nStates repeatedly and clearly state that they ‘do not deny benefits based on a household member’s \nsexual orientation or gender identity’ for purposes of administering SNAP benefits,” and that \nPlaintiffs’ had not explained how the challenged documents “would impact their state laws regarding \nsports participation, restroom use, religious freedom, or free speech.”  Id. at *2.  Subsequently, the \nparties briefed their positions on Plaintiffs’ motion, and that motion is now ripe for decision. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a plaintiff bears \nthe burden to establish federal court jurisdiction.  See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \n8 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 15 of 33   PageID #: 687\n\n“Both constitutional and statutory requirements . . . must be met before jurisdiction can be found.”  \nJones v. FBI, No. 3:21-CV-225, 2021 WL 5239586, at *2 (E.D. Tenn. Nov. 10, 2021).  And it is \n“presume[d] that federal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the \nrecord.” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 n.3 (2006) (citation omitted).   \nIn evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must assess whether the plaintiff \nhas “state[d] a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \n“Conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations will not suffice.”  \nEidson v. Tenn. Dep’t of Children’s Servs., 510 F.3d 631, 634 (6th Cir. 2007).  “[W]here the well-pleaded \nfacts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has \nalleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS. \nA.  Plaintiffs Do Not Satisfy Article III’s Requirement of Standing. \nTo establish standing, Plaintiffs “must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  Where a plaintiff seeks \nprospective relief, as Plaintiffs do here, the “threatened injury must be certainly impending to \nconstitute injury in fact”; “[a]llegations of possible future injury are not sufficient.”  Clapper v. Amnesty \nInt’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) (citation omitted).  The prospect of enforcing a purportedly \nunlawful statute or regulation against a plaintiff must be “sufficiently imminent” to create a concrete \ninjury.  Platt v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 769 F.3d 447, 451 (6th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  A “theory of \nstanding [that] relies on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities, does not satisfy” this requirement.  \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 410.  Here, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden to demonstrate standing. \nPlaintiffs principally claim that their sovereignty will be infringed by the May 5 Memo and \n9 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 16 of 33   PageID #: 688\n\nFinal Rule.  See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 123, 125, 130–131, 138.  But they cannot show any concrete injury to \ntheir sovereignty, that any such injury would be traceable to the May 5 Memo and Final Rule as \ndistinguished from Title IX and the FNA, or that the Court could redress such an injury by setting \naside those documents.  Plaintiffs assert injury because the Final Rule and May 5 Memo “at least \narguably conflict” with some of their state laws.  See Compl. ¶¶ 130-31 (identifying state laws for only \nthirteen of the twenty-two Plaintiff States).  But, as the Court has already noted, that claim is wholly \nconclusory:  Plaintiffs “do[] not explain how” compliance with USDA’s interpretation of sex-\ndiscrimination prohibitions “regarding only SNAP benefits, would impact their states laws regarding \nsports participation, restroom use, religious freedom, or free speech.”  Tennessee, 2022 WL 5336196, at \n*2.  Indeed, Plaintiffs affirm that they do not discriminate in the administration of SNAP on the basis \nof gender identity or sexual orientation, see Compl. ¶¶ 12, 40, and they do not allege that their state \nlaws require them to do so.  Thus, Plaintiffs have identified no concrete harm to their sovereign \ninterests from the May 5 Memo or June 14 Final Rule. \nPlaintiffs also allege they face an imminent loss of significant federal funds if they fail to adopt \nnew FSAs that mirror the language of the Final Rule, but they have not shown any action that could \nlead to such an injury is sufficiently imminent for standing purposes.  Indeed, not one Plaintiff alleges \nthat it will refuse to sign the new SNAP FSAs if those agreements contain the Final Rule’s updated \nstandard non-discrimination language.  And as of today, twenty-one Plaintiffs have already entered \ninto new SNAP FSAs containing the updated non-discrimination language.  Yet others have the \nopportunity to negotiate as to the terms of the FSA.  See 7 C.F.R. § 272(b)(2).  Accordingly, it is pure \nspeculation to say that Plaintiffs are in imminent danger of losing significant federal funds from failing \nto sign new FSAs.  Cf. Sch. of the Ozarks, Inc. v. Biden, 41 F.4th 992, 998 (8th Cir. 2022). \nSimilarly,  Plaintiffs  cannot  demonstrate  a  credible  threat  of  imminent  enforcement \nproceedings or show that they will face financial harm.  Again, Plaintiffs have stated that they do not \n10 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 17 of 33   PageID #: 689\n\nengage in sex discrimination, even as USDA understands that term, in their administration of SNAP \nbenefits, Compl. ¶ 12, and so there can be no concrete expectation that Plaintiffs will face enforcement \nproceedings based on instances of such discrimination.  And even if enforcement proceedings could \nbe expected, nothing about the May 5 Memo or Final Rule would dictate the outcome of those \nproceedings.  See, e.g., May 5 Memo at 3; see also Sch. of the Ozarks, Inc., 41 F.4th at 998 (holding that \nplaintiffs did not have standing to challenge an agency memorandum that did not require the agency \nto “reach [a] specific enforcement decision”).  Plaintiffs’ abstract disagreement with Defendants’ \nstatutory interpretation is thus insufficient to establish standing. \nEven if Plaintiffs were able to identify a concrete conflict with their state laws or imminent \nthreat of enforcement proceedings, any injury Plaintiffs’ face would be traceable to the FNA and Title \nIX, not to the Final Rule or May 5 Memo.  As the challenged guidance documents clearly state, they \nhave no independent legal significance but, rather, set forth USDA’s interpretation of the provisions \nof Title IX and the FNA that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, to include discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, prohibitions that would exist even in the absence \nof the Final Rule and May 5 Memo.  Further, USDA employees have an entirely independent \nobligation, pursuant to internal USDA regulations, to ensure programs and activities receiving federal \nfinancial assistance from USDA comply with applicable civil rights laws.  See Contreras Decl. ¶ 12.  \nAccordingly, even without the Final Rule and May 5 Memo, USDA would still enforce the prohibitions \non sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination pursuant to Title IX and the FNA.  \nProhibiting enforcement of the Final Rule and May 5 Memo also would not redress Plaintiffs’ \nalleged injuries.  See Compl. at 49 (Prayer for Relief ¶¶A, I).  USDA does not “enforce” the Final Rule \nor May 5 Memo; USDA enforces Title IX and the FNA.  And courts may not “enjoin” an agency’s \nview of the law.  See Whole Women’s Health v. Jackson, 142 S. Ct. 522, 535 (2021) (“[A] federal court \nexercising its equitable authority may enjoin named defendants from taking specified unlawful actions. \n11 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 18 of 33   PageID #: 690\n\nBut . . . no court may . . . purport to enjoin challenged ‘laws themselves.’”). \nFinally,  Plaintiffs’  fear  that  the  Final  Rule  and  May  5  Memo  “could  trigger  Title  IX \nenforcement action by the Department of Education, which enforces Title IX,” Compl. ¶ 133, is not \ntraceable to USDA, and would not be redressed by an order of this Court.  Plaintiffs fail to identify \nany actual, impending Title IX enforcement action by the Department of Education, never mind a \ncausal connection between such an enforcement action and USDA’s Final Rule and May 5 Memo.  \nAnd in any event, the Department of Education resolves matters by informal means where possible, \n20 U.S.C. § 1682; 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(d), allowing Plaintiffs to remedy issues before any loss of federal \nfunds.  Finally, the federal government may enforce Title IX regardless of the existence of USDA’s \nFinal Rule and May 5 Memo, so Plaintiffs’ fears of enforcement are neither traceable to nor redressable \nby the invalidation of USDA’s documents.  Cf. Nuclear Info. & Res. Serv. v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 457 \nF.3d  941  (9th  Cir.  2006)  (existence  of  another  agency’s  unchallenged  regulation  made  injury \nunredressable).   \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claims are Not Ripe. \nFor similar reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims in this case are not ripe.  Ripeness is designed “to prevent \nthe courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract \ndisagreements over administrative policies,” and “to protect the agencies from judicial interference \nuntil an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the \nchallenging parties.’”  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807–08 (2003) (citation \nomitted).  The ripeness test comprises two elements: (1) the fitness of the matter for adjudication, and \n(2) the hardship to the plaintiffs in withholding relief.  Warshak v. United States, 532 F.3d 521, 525 (6th \nCir. 2008).  In a pre-enforcement challenge to a statutory scheme, where a court has “no idea whether \nor when” the statute will be enforced against the plaintiff and “no idea what” the particular factual \ncircumstances of any ultimate dispute will be, a claim is not ripe.  Id. at 526 (citation omitted).   \n12 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 19 of 33   PageID #: 691\n\nHere, Plaintiffs’ claims are not fit for adjudication.  A matter is “‘fit for judicial decision” when \n“it arises in a concrete factual context and concerns a dispute that is likely to come to pass.”  Id. at \n525.  But it is far from clear that Plaintiffs will ever face any sanction from Defendants that relates to \ntheir compliance with the May 5 Memo’s interpretive guidance, or that stems from any (as yet \nunstated) refusal to adopt the Final Rule’s language proposed for use in FSAs.  And the factual context \nof any potential enforcement action or penalty is even less certain, especially given that Plaintiffs’ \ndisclaim any present or future intent to deny USDA benefits based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  See Compl. ¶ 12.  It is apparent, then, that the issues that Plaintiffs seek to raise in this case \nwill be “better grasped when viewed in light of a particular application” of the sex-discrimination \nprohibitions in Title IX and the FNA.  Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 301 (1998). \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs will face no hardship from withholding judicial review now, as the \nhighly reticulated enforcement processes that channel USDA’s enforcement efforts would afford \nthem a full opportunity to present their claims in any future enforcement proceeding.  In particular, \nFNS’s suspension and disallowance process provides multiple opportunities for an offending state \nagency to come into compliance.  See Kline Decl. ¶ 17.  Indeed, only after a state agency fails to \nrespond satisfactorily to an Advance Notification, Formal Warning, or corrective action proposal does \nFNS consider suspending or disallowing federal funds, id., and the extent of such suspension or \ndisallowance is subject to the Secretary’s discretion.  Id.; see also 7 U.S.C. § 2020(g).  Even then, \ndisallowance is appealable to the State SNAP Appeals Board, and to a court.  See Kline Decl. ¶ 18. \nFNS’s Civil Rights Division (“CRD”) likewise has an elaborate enforcement process that aims \nto resolve complaints at the lowest possible level.  Contreras Decl. ¶¶ 22, 25.  If the process does not \nresolve the complaint, CRD proceeds through an investigative stage, produces a report, and then \nissues a Final Agency Decision, which is appealable to USDA’s OASCR.  Id. ¶ 23.  If OASCR affirms \nthe Final Agency Decision, USDA may seek compliance through procedures set forth at 7 C.F.R. \n13 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 20 of 33   PageID #: 692\n\n§ 15.8 or through other means, including referral to the Department of Justice.  See Contreras Decl. \n¶¶ 26-28 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 15.8).  FNS has never sought to suspend, terminate, or refuse to grant or \nto continue financial assistance to a State under 7 C.F.R. § 15.8.  Contreras Decl. ¶ 30.  Given all the \nprocedures available prior to the imposition of any penalty by Defendants, Plaintiffs “will have ample \nopportunity later to bring its legal challenge at a time when harm is more imminent and more certain.”  \nOhio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 729–30 (1998); see also id. 733–34 (case was not ripe \nwhere there would be an administrative process before plaintiffs would face any “practical harm”). \nC.  Title IX and the FNA Provide Plaintiffs with Adequate and Exclusive Remedies \nThis Court also lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims for two additional reasons:  First, the \nAPA’s alternative remedy provision precludes Plaintiffs from bringing this action when they can raise \ntheir arguments as defenses in any future Title IX or FNA enforcement action.  Second, Congress \ncreated exclusive avenues through which Plaintiffs may challenge the enforcement actions they fear \nwill be brought under Title IX and the FNA.  See Compl. ¶ 126 (alleging that “Plaintiffs . . . face an \nimmediate threat that the USDA will enforce the Final Rule”); id. ¶ 133 (claiming that “USDA’s actions \ncould trigger Title IX enforcement action by the Department of Education”). \nThe APA conditions judicial review on the requirement that there be “no other adequate \nremedy in a court.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  “The essential inquiry is whether another statutory scheme of \njudicial review exists so as to preclude review under the more general provisions of the APA.”  Bangura \nv. Hansen, 434 F.3d 487, 501 (6th Cir. 2006).  Where “Congress did not intend the general grant of \nreview in the APA to duplicate existing procedures for review of agency action” a court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction over APA claims.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 (1988).  Here, for \nexample, if the United States filed suit against one of the Plaintiffs for having violated Title IX or the \nFNA, that State would “[a]lmost by definition [] have an adequate remedy in a court, that is, the remedy \nof opposing the . . . motion in . . . court.”  NAACP v. Meese, 615 F. Supp. 200, 213 (D.D.C. 1985).  \n14 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 21 of 33   PageID #: 693\n\nThat would afford a judicial forum that would “obviat[e] the need for resort to the APA.”  Id.   \nEven  beyond  the  APA’s  restrictions,  it  is  clear that  Congress  did  not  intend  for  pre-\nenforcement judicial review of any USDA action seeking to remedy violations of Title IX or the FNA \nbecause it mandated extensive administrative enforcement proceedings culminating in the opportunity \nfor judicial review.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1682-1683 (Title IX); 7 U.S.C. §§ 2020(g), 2023 (FNA).  Where it \nis “fairly discernable” that an elaborate statutory review scheme was intended to create an exclusive \nremedy, parallel jurisdiction outside that scheme is precluded.  See Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207, 216 \n(citation omitted); see also Elgin v. Dep’t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1 (2012).  As in Thunder Basin, this Court \ndoes not have jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ challenge to USDA’s interpretation of Title IX or the \nFNA before the United States has initiated any enforcement proceedings.  Plaintiffs style their \ncomplaint as challenging the statutory interpretation announced in Defendants’ documents, but the \nsame was true in Thunder Basin.  510 U.S. at 205 (describing plaintiff’s pre-enforcement “challenge [to] \nthe [agency’s] interpretation of” a statute).  Courts have long refused to allow funding recipients to \ncircumvent the civil rights laws’ administrative enforcement processes in this manner.  See, e.g., Taylor \nv. Cohen, 405 F.2d 277 (4th Cir. 1968) (en banc); Sch. Dist. of City of Saginaw v. U.S. Dep’t of Health, Educ., \n& Welfare, 431 F. Supp. 147 (E.D. Mich. 1977).  Indeed, in Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850, 859-64 (S.D. Ohio 2016), another district court in the Sixth \nCircuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over a school district’s challenge to an agency’s guidance \ndocuments discussing Title IX’s application to discrimination against transgender students because \nthere was an adequate remedy through Title IX’s administrative process.  In light of the extensive \nadministrative review scheme Congress established in that statute, see 7 U.S.C. §§ 2020(g), 2023, it is \nmore than “fairly discernable” that Congress intended to preclude pre-enforcement challenges in \nfederal court.  Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 216; Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 861. \n15 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 22 of 33   PageID #: 694\n\nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS LACK MERIT. \nA.  The May 5 Memo Is Not a Final Agency Action Subject to Judicial Review. \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs challenge the May 5 Memo as being contrary to law, arbitrary and \ncapricious, and procedurally deficient, those claims fail.  The APA permits judicial review only of “final \nagency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, which is agency action that is (1) “the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process” and that (2) also determines “rights or obligations.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154, 178 (1997) (citations omitted).  The May 5 Memo does not determine anyone’s “rights or \nobligations”; it merely announces USDA’s interpretation of Title IX and the FNA.   \nWith respect to the May 5 Memo, only an action to enforce compliance with that interpretation \nunder particular facts and circumstances could determine, as a final matter, a party’s rights or \nobligations regarding the laws.  FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 246 (1980).  USDA would \nhave to take numerous steps aimed at achieving compliance before it could even bring an enforcement \naction.  The unquantifiable and speculative “risk” that these steps will occur does not constitute a legal \nconsequence sufficient to make something final agency action.  Rather, “[a]s long as the agency \nremains free to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise, then the agency action in \nquestion has not established a binding norm.”  Pros. & Patients for Customized Care v. Shalala, 56 F.3d \n592, 594–97 (5th Cir. 1995) (citation omitted).   \nMerely “advis[ing] the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency proposes to \nexercise a discretionary power” does not create new obligations for the public.  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 \nU.S. 182, 197 (1993) (citation omitted).  Rather, doing so “create[s] no new legal obligations beyond \nthose the [statute] already imposed,” Rhea Lana, Inc. v. Dep’t of Lab., 824 F.3d 1023, 1028 (D.C. Cir. \n2016); Mann Constr. Inc. v. United States, 27 F.4th 1138, 1143 (6th Cir. 2022), and “simply states what \nthe administrative agency thinks the statute[s] mean[,]” First Nat’l Bank of Lexington v. Sanders, 946 F.2d \n1185, 1188 (6th Cir. 1991); see also Tenn. Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 (6th Cir. 2018) \n16 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 23 of 33   PageID #: 695\n\n(defining interpretive document as one that “simply states what the administrative agency thinks the \nstatute means” and “only reminds affected parties of existing duties”).  Because the May 5 Memo does \nnothing more, Plaintiffs’ claims regarding it lack any merit.   \nB.  USDA Has Complied with Applicable Notice-and-Comment Requirements. \nBecause the May 5 Memo creates no legal obligations, it is an interpretive rule that “does not \nrequire notice and comment procedures prior to its adoption.”  See Michigan v. Thomas, 805 F.2d 176, \n183 (6th Cir. 1986).  Plaintiffs have not established it should have been subject to notice and comment.   \nThe Final Rule, however, was put through notice and comment and, therefore, Plaintiffs’ \nnotice-and-comment challenge to it also fails.  Plaintiffs argue that the notice-and-comment process \nwas defective as to the updated discrimination statement in the Final Rule because that statement is \npurportedly not a logical outgrowth of the Proposed Rule on which the public commented.  Id. ¶ 157.  \nBut USDA’s Proposed Rule gave “a description of the subjects and issues involved” in the rulemaking, \nas required by 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3).  The Proposed Rule made clear that it was intended to “update[] \nFSA language [to] emphasize existing non-discrimination protections for SNAP households to the \neffect that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex” or other protected traits be the \n“subject of discrimination under SNAP.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 81,016-17.  To do this, the anticipated final \nrule “would incorporate references to additional civil rights legislation[, including Title IX,] into the \nstandard FSA language,” which already prohibited sex discrimination.  Id. at 81,015, 81,017.   \nAt the time, significant litigation was already pending regarding the meaning of Title IX’s \nprohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681, especially in relation to \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity in schools.  See G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. \nBd., 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2016); Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., No. 16-CV-\n943-PP, 2016 WL 5239829 (E.D. Wis. Sept. 22, 2016); Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 859-64; Texas v. \nUnited States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 826–27 (N.D. Tex. 2016).  The public was on notice that USDA \n17 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 24 of 33   PageID #: 696\n\nwas contemplating making the non-discrimination statement in the FSA explicitly incorporate Title \nIX’s non-discrimination provision and providing more detail about the “existing non-discrimination \nprotections for SNAP households.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 81,016.  Accordingly, that USDA might \nincorporate judicial decisions regarding the meaning of Title IX’s non-discrimination language related \nto gender identity and sexual orientation was entirely foreseeable. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Contrary-to-Law Claim Is Unlikely to Succeed \nPlaintiffs’ complaint centers on the contention that USDA’s interpretations of the phrases “on \nthe basis of sex” in Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), and “by reason of . . . sex” in the FNA, 7 U.SC. § \n2020(c)(1), are unlawful.  See Compl. ¶¶ 178-97.  But that can hardly be the case in light of Bostock.  \nCourts have recognized that “Title IX’s language closely resembles Title VII’s.”  Peltier v. Charter Day \nSch., Inc., 8 F.4th 251, 273 (4th Cir. 2021) (explaining that although Bostock involved Title VII rather \nthan Title IX, its reasoning “is consistent with the broadly applicable text of Title IX”), aff’d in part and \nvacated in part, 37 F.4th 104 (4th Cir. 2022); Wolfe v. Fayetteville, Ark. Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 860, 866 (8th \nCir. 2011) (holding that the “Supreme Court’s interpretation of Title VII properly informs our \nexamination of Title IX”).  The resemblance is particularly notable with respect to the language at \nissue in Bostock.  Just as Title VII prohibits discrimination “because of” sex, Title IX prohibits \ndiscrimination against that individual “on the basis of sex.”  See, e.g., Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753 (holding \n“that employers are prohibited from firing employees on the basis of [sexual orientation] or transgender \nstatus”) (emphasis added).  And though there are practical and linguistic differences in Title VII’s \n“because of,” Title IX’s “on the basis of,” and FNA’s “by reason of,” the Supreme Court in Bostock \nrelied on iterations of all these terms in reaching its decision.  See, e.g., 140 S. Ct. at 1740–41 (stating \nthat an employer may not intentionally treat “a person worse because of sex,” and that “it is impossible \nto discriminate against a person” for reasons related to gender identity or sexual preference “without \n18 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 25 of 33   PageID #: 697\n\ndiscriminating based on sex”) (emphasis added); id. at 1739 (Court noted that ‘‘the ordinary meaning of \nbecause of is by reason of or ‘on account of.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).   \nIndeed, because of the similar meaning of the standards, many courts have recognized that \nBostock’s reasoning regarding Title VII extends to Title IX.  See, e.g., Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., \n972 F.3d 586, 618 (4th Cir. 2020); Boston All. of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Youth v. HHS, 557 \nF. Supp. 3d 224, 244 (D. Mass. 2021) (holding that “[t]hough Bostock was a Title VII case, the Supreme \nCourt’s reasoning applies equally outside of Title VII.”); Doe v. Univ. of Scranton, No. 3:19-cv-01486, \n2020 WL 5993766, at *5 n.61 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 9, 2020) (finding “persuasive” the argument that Bostock \nextends to Title IX); see also Walker v. Azar, 480 F. Supp. 3d 417, 430 (E.D.N.Y. 2020); Whitman-Walker \nClinic, Inc. v. HHS, 485 F. Supp. 3d 1, 64 (D.D.C. 2020).   \nThe absence of any substantial practical, linguistic, or structural distinction between the non-\ndiscrimination mandates in Title VII, Title IX or the FNA renders Plaintiffs’ claims meritless.  \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs argue that Bostock’s reasoning was unlawfully applied by USDA to Title IX \nbecause Title IX “expressly permit[s] distinctions based on biological sex in certain circumstances.”  \nCompl. ¶ 182.  But the Fourth Circuit rejected a similar argument in Grimm, where it held that the \nviolation of Title IX is not in maintaining sex-separated facilities but in excluding transgender students \nfrom sex-separated facilities or programs consistent with their gender identity.  972 F.3d at 618.  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs cannot plausibly distinguish the text of the FNA from Title VII.  It is true, \nas Plaintiffs point out, that in Bostock, the Supreme Court assumed, “for argument’s sake, . . . that ‘sex’ \nsignified . . . biological distinctions between male and female.”  140 S. Ct. at 1739; see Compl. ¶ 58.  \nBut that was “just a starting point.  The question isn’t just what ‘sex’ meant, but what the [statute] says \nabout it.”  140 S. Ct. at 1739.  The Supreme Court explained that the statute prohibited discrimination \nagainst individuals “based on sex.”  Id. at 1741.  The Supreme Court placed great significance on the \nfact that Title VII’s anti-discrimination provision was focused on individuals—it meant that the law \n19 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 26 of 33   PageID #: 698\n\nwas focused on preventing employers from treating an “individual worse than others who are similarly \nsituated,” id. at 1740, and was not written so as to focus “on differential treatment between the two \nsexes as groups,” id. at 1741.  With that focus in mind, the Court concluded that “it is impossible to \ndiscriminate against a person for being [gay] or transgender without discriminating against that \nindividual based on sex.”  Id.  Likewise, the FNA’s anti-discrimination language “focuses on protecting \nindividuals from discrimination.”  May 5 Memo. at 2.  The Act “focuses on individual households . . \n. as opposed to program applicants as a whole,” id. at 2-3 (citing 7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1)).  As USDA \nexplained, “the focus on individual households and the prohibition of discrimination ‘by reason of’ \nsex under the [FNA] is sufficiently similar to Title VII such that the Bostock analysis applies to the \n[FNA].”  Id. at 3.  \nD. Plaintiffs’ Arbitrary-and-Capricious Claim Fails.  \nPlaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious argument is likewise unfounded.  Compl. ¶¶ 160–177.  The \nFinal Rule and May 5 Memo clearly explain USDA’s rationale for interpreting Title IX and the FNA \nto include prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  See \nMay 5 Memo at 1-3; 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855-56.  USDA’s reasoning follows that of the Court in Bostock, \nand accounting for and interpreting the application of the Supreme Court’s rationale in connection \nwith USDA’s implementation of the statutes cannot be arbitrary and capricious.  Cf. Whitman-Walker \nClinic, Inc. v. HHS, 485 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. 2020) (finding Title IX rule arbitrary and capricious \nwhere agency failed to consider Bostock’s reasoning); see generally FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nU.S. 502, 515 (2009) (an agency need not demonstrate “that the reasons for the new policy are better \nthan the reasons for the old one,” but only that “the new policy is permissible under the statute, that \nthere are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better.”).   \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Assorted Constitutional Claims Fail \nPlaintiffs also set forth a smorgasbord of constitutional arguments under the Spending Clause, \n20 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 27 of 33   PageID #: 699\n\nthe  Tenth  Amendment,  the  First  Amendment,  and  various  doctrines  such  as  the  Anti-\nCommandeering Doctrine, the Non-Delegation Doctrine, and the Major Questions Doctrine.  All \nlack merit because USDA’s Final Rule and May 5 Memo are based on a straightforward interpretation \nof Title IX and the FNA in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock. \n1.  Spending Clause \nThe Supreme Court has long acknowledged that “Congress has authority under the Spending \nClause to appropriate federal moneys to promote the general welfare” and “to see to it that taxpayer \ndollars appropriated under that power are in fact spent for the general welfare.” Sabri v. United States, \n541 U.S. 600, 605 (2004).  That power to impose conditions on the receipt of federal funds applies \nregardless of whether Congress legislates “in an area historically of state concern.” Id. at 608 n.*. \nPlaintiffs contend they lacked constitutionally adequate notice of the Final Rule and May 5 \nMemo because neither of the statutes interpreted therein “unambiguously notify the States of any \nconditions attached to the” appropriated funds.  Compl. ¶ 211.  This claim is meritless.  As the \nSupreme Court made clear in Bostock after reviewing analogous language in Title VII, the “express \nterms of [the] . . . statute give us [the] . . . answer,” 140 S. Ct. at 1737, that “it is impossible to \ndiscriminate against a person for being [gay] or transgender without discriminating against that \nindividual based on sex.”  140 S. Ct. at 1741.  The Court noted “Title VII’s broad language,” id. at \n1747, encompasses other forms of discrimination, including “sexual harassment” and “motherhood \ndiscrimination,” id. (internal quotation marks omitted), and “all forms of discrimination because of \nsex, however they may manifest themselves or whatever labels might attach to them.”  Id.  It has been \ntwo years since the Bostock decision was issued, and six years since the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Dodds \nv. Department of Education, 845 F.3d 217, 221-22 (6th Cir. 2015) (per curiam), which found that Title IX \nprohibits discrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender nonconformity.  Plaintiffs cannot say \nthat they lacked notice that USDA, which already had conditioned its SNAP and SNAP-Ed funding \n21 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 28 of 33   PageID #: 700\n\non compliance with Title IX and the FNA, would inform states that the agency would assess \ncompliance in a manner consistent with its interpretation of those statutes in light of Bostock. \nPlaintiffs further argue that the Final Rule and May 5 Memo are improperly coercive under \nNat’l Fed’n of Indep. Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 584 (2012) (“NFIB”).  In that case, the Supreme \nCourt held that Congress could not make the entirety of a State’s traditional Medicaid funding \ncontingent on participation in a new program to provide health coverage for all low-income adults.  \nBut here, the Secretary is not “enlisting the States in a new . . . . care program.”  Id.  See Gruver v. La. \nBd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. & Mech. Coll., 959 F.3d 178, 184 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 141 S. \nCt. 901 (2020) (“The problem in NFIB was that Congress had conditioned all of a state’s Medicaid \nfunding on accepting significant obligations that created a new program entirely different than the \noriginal one the state had opted in to.”); see also Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 329 F. Supp. 3d 597, 629 \n(W.D. Tenn. 2018), aff’d sub nom. State by & through Tenn. Gen. Assembly v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 931 F.3d \n499 (6th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 549 (2020) (“The State must also show that Congress has \ncreated a new condition that is different from the original program Congress is purporting to modify \nand is using that program’s funding as leverage to force the states to accept the new condition.”).  The \nSecretary is simply applying the existing provisions of Title IX and the FNA to its longstanding \nnutrition programs, including SNAP and SNAP-Ed, based on an interpretation of those statutes that \nhas been recognized as valid under analogous circumstances in Bostock.  This does not constitute \nunlawful coercion under NFIB.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ Spending Clause claim lacks merit. \n2.  Tenth Amendment and Anticommandeering Doctrine \nBecause the Final Rule and May 5 Memo are permitted under the Spending Clause, they do \nnot constitute an impermissible “commandeering” of state-run institutions.  As the Supreme Court \nhas explained, valid conditions on the receipt of federal funds do not constitute commandeering.  See \nNew York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167, 173 (1992) (contrasting conditions with commandeering). \n22 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 29 of 33   PageID #: 701\n\n3.  Separation of Powers and Non-Delegation Doctrine \nPlaintiffs further claim that USDA’s Final Rule and May 5 Memo violate the major questions \ndoctrine and the non-delegation doctrine.  Compl. ¶¶ 246–257.  Neither contention has any merit.  \nThis is not one of those rare, extraordinary cases that raises the major questions doctrine.  See West \nVirginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2608 (2022) (explaining that such cases are ones “in which the history \nand the breadth of the authority that [the agency] has asserted, and the economic and political \nsignificance of that assertion, provide a reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to \nconfer such authority” (citations omitted)).  USDA is not exercising any vast new authority to \nimplement policies that Congress could not have intended.  Congress clearly intended to prohibit sex \ndiscrimination against individuals under both Title IX and the FNA.  Even if the drafters “weren’t \nthinking about many of the [statutes’] consequences, . . . the limits of the drafters’ imagination supply \nno reason to ignore the law’s demands.”  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1737.  The Supreme Court made clear \nin Bostock that “Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination in employment is a major piece of federal \ncivil rights litigation,” written in “starkly broad terms,” that encompasses conduct in which employers \n“fir[e] employees on the basis of [sexual orientation] or transgender status.”  Id. at 1753 (emphasis added).  \nThis was why the Supreme Court found that opponents of this reading of Title VII could not “hide \nbehind the no-elephants-in-mouseholes cannon,” id.; the expanse of the prohibition “has been \nstanding before us all along.”  Id.  See also West Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2622 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(identifying the elephants-in-mouseholes canon as part of the major questions analysis).   \nPlaintiffs’ nondelegation challenge is equally deficient.  A “nondelegation inquiry always begins \n(and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation.  The constitutional question is whether Congress \nhas supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion.”  Gundy v. United States, \n139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019).  “[T]he answer requires construing the challenged statute to figure out \nwhat task it delegates and what instructions it provides.”  Id.  Here, as in Bostock, “the express terms \n23 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 30 of 33   PageID #: 702\n\nof [the statutes] give us one answer,” 140 S. Ct. at 1737, which is that administrators of USDA-funded \nprograms may not discriminate against individuals “on the basis of [sex, including. . .sexual orientation] \nor transgender status.”  Id. at 1753.  Nothing more is required under the nondelegation inquiry.    \n4.  First Amendment \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment arguments are unlikely to succeed because they are based on \nunsupported speculation.  For example, Plaintiffs contend that USDA is forcing “Plaintiffs and their \nemployees to engage in biologically inaccurate speech and to forbid biologically accurate speech.”  \nCompl. ¶ 222.  But neither the Final Rule nor the May 5 Memo says anything of the sort.  Plaintiffs \nsuggest that the Final Rule and the May 5 Memo violate the free speech rights of teachers and \nprofessors, citing, for example, Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3 492 (6th Cir. 2021).  But Meriwether \ninvolved an individual’s free speech rights, not a state’s, and USDA has not addressed pronoun usage \nin the challenged documents.  Nor does this case present the sort of fact-intensive dispute that was at \nissue in Meriwether.  USDA FNS has not received a program discrimination complaint, has not \nconducted a specific program investigation, and has not made any case specific determination finding  \nthat an individual’s use of incorrect pronouns constitutes discrimination in its programs (further \nunderscoring how unripe Plaintiffs’ challenge is).   \nNext, Plaintiffs inaccurately contend that the Final Rule and May 5 Memo conflict with \nreligious liberty guarantees under the First Amendment.  Compl. ¶ 217.  Whatever those guarantees \nmay be, they do not belong to the States, and the States lacks standing to assert them on behalf of \nreligious employers and employees.  See, e.g., Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485–86 (1923) \n(“While the state, under some circumstances, may sue in that capacity for the protection of its citizens, \nit is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal \ngovernment.”); Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 597 (6th Cir. 2022) (same); New Mexico v. McAleenan, \n450 F. Supp. 3d 1130, 1208 (D.N.M. 2020) (noting general consensus “that the First Amendment \n24 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 31 of 33   PageID #: 703\n\nworks in one direction: it protects people and private entities, not governments”). \nMoreover, the States fail to acknowledge that Title IX and USDA’s own regulations contain a \nreligious exemption.  Since its enactment, Title IX has exempted educational institutions that are \ncontrolled by religious organizations from complying with Title IX’s prohibitions which conflict with \ntheir religious tenets.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3).  Since April 1979, USDA’s Title IX regulations have \nmade clear that they do “not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious \norganization to the extent application of this part would not be consistent with the religious tenets of \nsuch organization.”  See 44 Fed. Reg. 21,610, 21,613 (Apr. 11, 1979).  On October 6, 2017, USDA \nupdated its Title IX regulations but the language relating to the religious exemption in the new \nregulation, 7 C.F.R. § 15a.205, is similar to the 1979 regulatory language (“This part does not apply to \nany operation of an educational institution or other entity that is controlled by a religious organization \nto the extent that application of this part would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such \norganization.”).  See 82 Fed. Reg. 46,655, 46,659 (Oct. 6, 2017); 7 C.F.R. § 15a.205(a).  The States do \nnot identify any specific religious employer or employee who will be harmed by the Final Rule or May \n5 Memo, nor do they discuss how the religious exemptions would apply. \nFinally, the States argue USDA’s actions violate their own First Amendment rights.  Compl. ¶ \n220.  But, of course, States do not have First Amendment rights.  See Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc. v. \nDemocratic Nat’l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 139 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring); New Mexico, 450 F. Supp. at \n1208.  The First Amendment protects the rights of individuals against the government, not the rights \nof States against the federal government.  That work is done by the Tenth Amendment, under which, \nas described above, the States’ arguments also fail. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss under either Rule \n12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) and close this case. \n25 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 71   Filed 12/05/22   Page 32 of 33   PageID #: 704\n\nDated: December 5, 2022               Respectfully submitted, \n   BRIAN M.

The States \nmove under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) and 5 U.S.C. § 705 for an order preliminarily \nenjoining  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (“USDA”),  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture,  the \nAdministrator of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, the Director of the Food and Nutrition \nService Civil Rights Division, their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and any other \npersons who are in active concert or participation with those individuals from enforcing the \nfollowing documents against Plaintiff States and entities within those States:  \n•  The USDA’s reinterpretation of Title IX.  USDA, CRD 01-2022, Application of Bostock \nv. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing – Policy Update (May \n5, 2022), https://bit.ly/3NuXnSx (“Memorandum”).  \n \n•  The cover letter for the Memorandum issued by the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service.  \nUSDA, Cover Letter to CRD 01-2022, Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to \nProgram Discrimination Complaint Processing – Policy Update (May 5, 2022) (“Cover \nLetter”). \n  \n•  The Memorandum’s “questions and answers” document issued by the USDA’s Food and \nNutrition Service.   USDA, CRD 02-2022, Questions and Answers Related to CRD 01-\n2022 Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint \nProcessing  –  Policy  Update  (May  5,  2022),  https://bit.ly/3yzKpyG  (“Memorandum \nQ&A”). \n \n•  The additional guidance on the publication of documents and notices related to the USDA’s \nreinterpretation of Title IX issued by the Department’s Food and Nutrition Service.  USDA, \nMemorandum Regarding Revised Nondiscrimination Statement and “And Justice for All” \nPosters;  Timelines  and  Guidance  for  Implementation  (May  5,  2022)  (“Supplemental \nMemorandum”) (collectively with Memorandum, Cover Letter, and Memorandum Q&A, \n“Memoranda”).  \n \n•  The USDA’s adoption of its new nondiscrimination policy to be adopted in Supplemental \nNutrition  Assistance  Program  (“SNAP”)  Federal-State  Agreements.    Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program: Civil Rights Update to the Federal-State Agreement, 87 \nFed. Reg. 35,855 (June 14, 2022), https://bit.ly/3bDC4RA (“Final Rule”). \n2 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 2   Filed 07/26/22   Page 2 of 9   PageID #: 140\n\n \nAs explained in the States’ accompanying memorandum, the States are likely to succeed \non their claims alleging that the USDA’s Memoranda and Final Rule violate the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706.  The Memoranda and Final Rule violate the APA’s notice-\nand-comment requirements; are arbitrary and capricious; conflict with Title IX; conflict with the \nFood and Nutrition Act; and violate the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Tenth \nAmendment, nondelegation doctrine, and separation-of-powers principles.  Preliminary relief is \nnecessary to prevent substantial irreparable harms—harms that include forcing States to choose \nbetween their sovereignty in enacting and enforcing their laws on the one hand and substantial \nfederal funding on the other.  Preliminary relief will serve the public interest by maintaining the \nstatus quo and preventing the unlawful new rules from disrupting SNAP programs, State-run \nschools, and other State agencies.  See Tennessee v. Dept. of Education, No. 3:21-CV-308, 2022 \nWL 2791450 (E.D. Tenn. July 15, 2022). \nBecause the Memoranda and Final Rule imminently threaten federal funding for the States, \nthe States request expedited briefing.  The USDA, for example, requires Tennessee to adopt the \nnew policy by August 15, 2022, or risk losing over $6 million in SNAP Nutrition Educational \nProgram funding for the next fiscal year.  See Niknejad Decl. ¶¶ 10-12 (attached as Exhibit A).  \nAccordingly, the States propose the following schedule so that this Court can rule on the States’ \nmotion before the USDA’s August 15 deadline: \n•  August 2, 2022:  Defendants file Response in Opposition to States’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction. \n•  August 5, 2022:  States file Reply in Support of States’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. \n3 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257   Document 2   Filed 07/26/22   Page 3 of 9   PageID #: 141\n\n \nThe States further request that this Court hear oral argument on the motion.   Argument is \nwarranted  because  this  motion  raises  significant  questions  of  statutory  interpretation  and \nconstitutional law, and it implicates the interests of States, educational institutions, and others \nacross the country.  The States are available for oral argument during the week of August 8, 2022. \nFinally, the States request that this Court exercise its discretion to waive the security \nrequirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).   \n \nDated: July 26, 2022         \nRespectfully Submitted,  \n \n \n/s/ Brandon J.

President  Biden  directed  federal  agencies  to  rewrite  federal  law  to \nimplement the Administration’s policy of “prevent[ing] and combat[ing] discrimination on the \nbasis of gender identity or sexual orientation.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 \n(Jan.  20,  2021).    In  response,  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  (“USDA”  or \n“Department”), ignoring procedural requirements, issued directives and rules that misconstrue the \nlaw and impose unlawful requirements on Plaintiffs.  \n2.  First,  the  Department  issued  a  memorandum  updating  the  Food  and \nNutrition Services complaint-processing policy related to claims of discrimination based on gender \nidentity or sexual orientation.  USDA, CRD 01-2022, Application of Bostock v. Clayton County \nto  Program  Discrimination  Complaint  Processing  –  Policy  Update  (May  5,  2022), \nhttps://bit.ly/3NuXnSx (“Memorandum”) (attached as Exhibit A).  The Memorandum purports to \nimpose new requirements on States, forcing them to adopt the Department’s flawed understanding \nof what constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX.  Id. at 2-3.  \n3.  The cover letter for the Memorandum stated that the Department’s new \npolicy  “applies  to  prohibitions  against  discrimination  based  on  sex  in  all  FNS  programs,” \nrecognizing that “these changes may impact [State and local] operations.”  USDA, Cover Letter \nto CRD 01-2022, Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint \nProcessing – Policy Update (May 5, 2022) (“Cover Letter”) (attached as Exhibit B). \n4.  Attached to the Memorandum was a “questions and answers” document, \nwhich, among other commands, directs States to “update their program discrimination complaint \nprocessing procedures for allegations related to service and activities receiving federal financial \nassistance from the USDA to ensure discrimination complaints alleging sexual orientation and \n2 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 2 of 54   PageID #: 2\n\ngender identity discrimination are processed as complaints of prohibited sex discrimination.”  \nUSDA, CRD 02-2022, Questions and Answers Related to CRD 01-2022 Application of Bostock \nv. Clayton County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing – Policy Update (May 5. \n2022), https://bit.ly/3yzKpyG (“Memorandum Q&A”) (attached as Exhibit C). \n5.  The Department provided “[a]dditional guidance” a short time later, which \nmade plain the extent of federal overreach.  While purporting to explain the Memorandum, the \nagency  separately  directed  State-level  SNAP  administrators—which  include  public  primary \nschools,  secondary  schools,  and  universities—to  “update[]”  their  “documents,  pamphlets, \nwebsites, etc.” with the following “Nondiscrimination Statement”: \nIn accordance with federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture \n(USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, this institution is prohibited from \ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including gender \nidentity and sexual orientation), religious creed, disability, age, political beliefs, or \nreprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity. \nSupplemental Memoranda at 1 (citing Technical Assistance & Guidance, FNS Nondiscrimination \nStatement (May 5, 2022), https://bit.ly/3nZTc6W (“Nondiscrimination Statement”)). \n6.  This was immediately followed with a directive ordering Plaintiffs to update \nvarious posters and policies with immediate effect.  See USDA, Memorandum Regarding Revised \nNondiscrimination Statement and “And Justice for All” Posters; Timelines and Guidance for \nImplementation  (May  5,  2022)  (“Supplemental  Memorandum”)  (attached  as  Exhibit  D) \n(collectively with the Cover Letter, Memorandum, and Memorandum Q&A, the “Memoranda”).  \n7.  The  Department  compounded  its  errors  by  ignoring  procedural \nrequirements  and  issuing  a  final  rule  to  formalize  a  new  policy  misapplying  Bostock.  \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Civil Rights Update to the Federal-State Agreement, \n87 Fed. Reg. 35,855 (June 14, 2022), https://bit.ly/3bDC4RA (“Final Rule”) (attached as Exhibit \n3 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 3 of 54   PageID #: 3\n\nE).  Instead of going through the legal process mandated by the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”), the Department coopted a previously discarded proposed regulation from 2016 to issue \nthe new Final Rule.  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Civil Rights Update to the \nFederal-State  Agreement,  81  Fed.  Reg.  81,015  (Nov.  17,  2016)  https://bit.ly/3aMNXVf  \n(“Proposed Rule”) (attached as Exhibit F).   \n8.  Collectively, the Memoranda and Final Rule inappropriately expand the law \nfar  beyond  what  statutory  text,  regulatory  requirements,  judicial  precedent,  and  the  U.S. \nConstitution permit.    \n9.  The Department claims that the interpretations in the Memoranda and Final \nRule are required by the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 \n(2020).  But Bostock was a narrow decision.  The Court held only that terminating an employee \n“simply for being homosexual or transgender” constitutes discrimination “because of . . . sex” \nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1737-\n38 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)).   \n10.  The Department’s Memoranda and Final Rule concern highly controversial \nand localized issues of enormous importance to the States, their subdivisions, affiliates, and \ncitizens.  The Department has no power to settle such issues, let alone by executive fiat without \nproviding any opportunity for public comment.  \n11.  Plaintiffs—the States of Tennessee, Indiana, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, \nArkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, \nOhio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia sue to \nprevent the Department from usurping authority that properly belongs to Congress, the States, and \n4 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 4 of 54   PageID #: 4\n\nthe people and to eliminate the nationwide confusion and upheaval that the Department’s Guidance \nhas inflicted on States and regulated entities.  \n12.  To be clear, the States do not deny benefits based on a household member’s \nsexual orientation or gender identity. But the States do challenge the unlawful and unnecessary \nnew obligations and liabilities that the Memoranda and Final Rule attempt to impose—obligations \nthat apparently stretch as far as ending sex-separated living facilities and athletics and mandating \nthe use of biologically inaccurate preferred pronouns.  \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff the State of Tennessee is a sovereign State and an employer \nsubject to the requirements of the Memoranda and Final Rule.  \n14.  Tennessee is home to political subdivisions and other entities that are \nsubject to the requirements of the Memoranda and Final Rule. \n15.  Tennessee  has  entered  into  a  Federal-State  Agreement  to  operate  the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”) within Tennessee and is thus subject to the \nrequirements of the Memoranda and Final Rule. \n16.  Tennessee operates programs and activities that receive funding and are \nthus subject to the Food and Nutrition Act.  7 U.S.C. §§ 2011-2036.  \n17.  In  fiscal  year  2020-2021,  Tennessee  received  approximately \n$2,600,264,708 in federal funding to operate SNAP under the Food and Nutrition Act.  This \nincludes approximately $102,192,555 for SNAP administration and $2,498,072,153 for SNAP \nbenefits.   \n5 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 5 of 54   PageID #: 5\n\n18.  Plaintiff the State of Indiana likewise has entered into a Federal-State \nAgreement to operate SNAP programs under the Food and Nutrition Act and thus is subject to the \nrequirements of the Memoranda and Final Rule.  \n19.  Plaintiffs  the  States  of  Alabama,  Alaska,  Arizona,  Arkansas,  Georgia, \nKansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South \nCarolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia likewise have entered into \nFederal-State Agreements to operate SNAP programs under the Food and Nutrition Act and thus \nare subject to the requirements of the Memoranda and Final Rule. \n20.  Each of the States receives significant federal funding for its SNAP-related \nprograms.  The Department’s own reporting shows that in Fiscal Year 2020, the Plaintiff States, \ncombined, received approximately $28,675,549,470 in funding for SNAP benefits.  USDA Food \nand  Nutrition  Service  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program,  Supplemental  Nutrition \nAssistance  Program  State  Activity  Report  Fiscal  Year  2020,  at  8  (March  2022) \nhttps://bit.ly/3ouappp (attached as Exhibit G).  \n21.  These  benefits  were  distributed  to  approximately  15,478,511  persons \nresiding within the Plaintiff States. Id. at 6.   \n22.  Tennessee, Indiana, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, \nKentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Montana,  Nebraska,  Ohio,  Oklahoma,  South \nCarolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia would also incur various \nadministrative and compliance costs if forced to comply with the requirements of the Memoranda \nand Final Rule.  \n6 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 6 of 54   PageID #: 6\n\n23.  Defendant United States Department of Agriculture is an executive agency \nof the federal government responsible for enforcement and administration of SNAP under the Food \nand Nutrition Act.  7 U.S.C. §§ 2011 et seq.  \n24.  Defendant Thomas J. Vilsack is the United States Secretary of Agriculture \nresponsible for the operation of the USDA.  7 U.S.C. § 2013.  He is sued in his official capacity.  \n25.  Defendant Cindy Long is the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition \nService at the USDA and responsible for the operation of programs under the Food and Nutrition \nAct.  She is sued in her official capacity.  \n26.  Defendant Roberto Contreras is Director of the Food and Nutrition Service \nCivil Rights Division at the USDA.  He is sued in his official capacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.  This  Court  has  federal-question  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  § 1331 \nbecause this case concerns whether the Department and its officials acted in compliance with the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and other federal laws.   \n28.  This  Court has  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1346 because this case \ninvolves a claim against agencies and employees of the federal government.  \n29.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1361 because the Court has \njurisdiction over any case “to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency \nthereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.”  \n30.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  Court  under  28  U.S.C.  § 1391(e)(1)  because \n(1) Plaintiff Tennessee resides in this District; (2) Tennessee’s agencies and employees subject to \nthe agency actions at issue reside in the District; and (3) “a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to [Tennessee’s] claim occurred” in this District.  \n7 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 7 of 54   PageID #: 7\n\n31.  This Court has the authority to grant Plaintiffs the relief they request under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-06; the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201-02; and 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Cooperative-Federalist Operation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram and The Department’s Regulatory Changes to SNAP Federal-State \nAgreements.  \n \n32.  Under the Food and Nutrition Act, SNAP provides support for vulnerable \ngroups, including low-income working families, the elderly, those with physical or intellectual \ndevelopmental disabilities, and others.  7 U.S.C. § 2014.  \n33.  The purpose of SNAP is to raise the “levels of nutrition among low-income \nhouseholds” because “establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will \npromote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation’s agricultural abundance and will \nstrengthen the nation’s agricultural economy.”  Id. § 2011.  For these reasons, and “to alleviate \nsuch hunger and malnutrition,” Congress established SNAP to “permit low-income households to \nobtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade.”  Id.   \n34.  To effectuate SNAP, States enter into a Federal-State Agreement with the \nDepartment, outlining how States will administer SNAP.  7 U.S.C. § 2020; see also 7 C.F.R. Part \n§§ 272.2 et seq.  The Federal-State Agreement is the “legal agreement between the State and the \nDepartment of Agriculture” and “is the means by which the State elects to operate SNAP and to \nadminister the program in accordance with the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008.”  7 C.F.R. \n§ 272.2(a)(2).   \n35.  The basic language and requirements of the Federal-State Agreements are \nset out in statute, 7 U.S.C. § 2020(d)-(e), and in regulation, 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b).   \n8 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 8 of 54   PageID #: 8\n\n36.  Federal-State Agreements must be signed by “the Governor of the State or \nauthorized designee” and “be submitted” to the Department “within 120 days after publication of \nthese regulations in final form.”  Id. § 272.2(e)(1).   \n37.  SNAP funding is also utilized for various ancillary work such as planning, \noutreach, and educational programs, which require similar agreements or State plans to be \nsubmitted to and approved by the Department and include requirements to adopt the Department’s \nnondiscrimination policy.  See 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(d)(1)-(2).  \n38.  States are already obligated to comply with and enact a nondiscrimination \npolicy that prohibits “discriminat[ion] against any applicant or participant in any aspect of program \nadministration, including, but not limited to, the certification of households, the issuance of \ncoupons, the conduct of fair hearings, or the conduct of any other program service for reasons of \nage, race, color, sex, disability, religious creed, national origin, or political beliefs.”  7 C.F.R. \n§ 272.6(a).  “Discrimination in any aspect of program administration is prohibited.”  Id.   \n39.  The  Food  and  Nutrition  Act  itself  specifies  that  State  agencies  are \nresponsible for conducting SNAP programs on Indian reservations unless the tribal organization \nhas, among other requirements, “ensure[d] that there shall be no discrimination in the operation of \nthe program on the basis of . . . sex.”  7 U.S.C. § 2020(d). \n40.  States—including  the  Plaintiff  States—do  not  discriminate  in  the \ndistribution of SNAP-funded assistance based on age, race, color, sex, disability, religious creed, \nnational origin, or political beliefs.  Nor do the States deny SNAP certification of applicant \nhouseholds based on household members’ sexual orientation or gender identity.   \n9 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 9 of 54   PageID #: 9\n\n41.  Revisions to the Federal-State Plan, from the State or as required by the \nDepartment “shall be prepared and submitted for approval” in the same manner as the original \nplanning documents.  7 C.F.R. § 272.2(f).   \n42.  States must also set up a complaint process, publicize these procedures and \npolicies, collect data for the Department, and report that data.  Id. § 272.6(c)-(h).   \n43.  Moreover, State agencies and their affiliates administering SNAP must \npublish  and  abide  by  a  “Nondiscrimination  Statement,”  which  the  Department  crafts  and \ndistributes.  See 7 C.F.R. § 272.6(f)(2). \n44.  If the Department determines that a State is not compliant with the statutes \nor regulations governing SNAP, “the Secretary shall immediately inform such State agency of \nsuch failure and shall allow the State agency a specified period of time for the correction of such \nfailure.”  7 U.S.C. § 2020(g). \n45.  “If the State agency does not correct such failure within that specified \nperiod” the Department may refer the matter to the Department of Justice to seek injunctive relief \nand “shall proceed to withhold from the State such funds . . . as the Secretary determines to be \nappropriate.”  Id. \n46.  One week after the 2016 Presidential Election, the outgoing Administration \npublished the Proposed Rule to update the civil rights assurance language contained in the SNAP \nregulations contained in the Federal-State Agreement (FSA).  See Proposed Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at \n81,015. \n47.  The original Proposed Rule merely amended the boilerplate language of the \nSNAP Federal-State Agreements to “comply with . . . Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.)” so that “no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of \n10 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 10 of 54   PageID #: 10\n\nsex, race, color, age, political belief, religious creed, disability, or national origin, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subject to discrimination under \nSNAP.”  Id. at 81,017.  \n48.  The original Proposed Rule also included new references to other civil \nrights laws already applicable to SNAP, including the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 6101 et seq; Title II and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as \namended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12189; and Executive Order \n13166, “Improving Access to Persons with Limited English Proficiency.”  Id. at 81,017.  \n49.  There is no mention of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity in the Proposed Rule.  \n50.  The public comment period was opened for sixty (60) days, during which \nonly five (5) comments were submitted—two of which were beyond the scope of the regulation.  \n51.  The public comment period closed on January 17, 2017, over five years ago. \n52.  None of the public comments addressed the issue of discrimination based \non sexual orientation or gender identity because this change was not included in the Proposed Rule. \n53.   The only commenter who mentioned “sex” merely stated her understanding \nthat “[t]he proposed rule will codify all of the civil rights language within Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 prohibiting discrimination based on sex for federally funded programs.”  \nComment to Proposed Rule by Brittany Jones, FNS-2016-0078-0005 (Posted on Feb. 5, 2017), \nhttps://bit.ly/3Phippw. \n54.  The Proposed Rule was withdrawn from the unified regulatory agenda on \nJune 23, 2017.  See Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, RIN 0584-AE51, Summary of \n11 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 11 of 54   PageID #: 11\n\nthe Proposed Rule, https://bit.ly/3PiVv0T (last visited July 18, 2022) (indicating that the Proposed \nRule was “withdrawn” on June 23, 2017).    \nB.  The Supreme Court Narrowly Held in Bostock v. Clayton County That Terminating \nan Employee Simply for Being Homosexual or Transgender Constitutes Sex \nDiscrimination. \n \n55.  Three years later, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Bostock that Title VII’s \nprohibition on employment discrimination “because of [an] individual’s . . . sex,” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-2(a)(1), includes terminating that individual simply for being homosexual or transgender, \nbecause—under Title VII’s precise wording—“[s]ex plays a necessary and undisguisable role” in \nsuch decisions, 140 S. Ct. at 1737.   \n56.  “[O]ther federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination,” such as Title \nIX and the Food and Nutrition Act, were not “before” the Court.  Id. at 1753.  The Court thus \nexpressly declined to “prejudge” whether its decision in Bostock would “sweep beyond Title VII” \nto those other laws.  Id. \n57.  The  Court  further  specifically  declined  to  consider  whether  employer \nconduct other than terminating an employee simply because the employee is homosexual or \ntransgender—for example, “sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes”—would \nconstitute actionable discrimination under Title VII.  Id. \n58.  The Court assumed that “sex” in Title VII “refer[s] only to biological \ndistinctions between male and female.”  Id. at 1739.  \n59.  The Court did not consider or decide what the statutory phrase “on the basis \nof sex” means in Title IX or in the Food and Nutrition Act. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); 7 U.S.C. \n§ 2020(d). \n12 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 12 of 54   PageID #: 12\n\n60.  Nor did the Court address Title IX’s safe harbor for sex-separated living \nfacilities.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n61.  Nor did the Court consider or decide questions about any other statute or \nany other form of alleged discrimination.  \nC.  President Biden’s Administration Uses Bostock to Justify Its Misinterpretation of \nTitle IX and Other Statutes and Threatens States with Enforcement Action. \n \n62.  As one of his first official acts as President, President Biden declared that \nBostock’s analysis changed the meaning of federal law regarding sex discrimination: “Under \nBostock’s reasoning, laws that prohibit sex discrimination—including Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), the Fair Housing Act, as amended (42 \nU.S.C. 3601 et seq.), and section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 \nU.S.C. 1522), along with their respective implementing regulations—prohibit discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain sufficient \nindications to the contrary.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021).   \n63.  Accordingly,  President  Biden  directed  federal  agencies  to  “review  all \nexisting orders, regulations, guidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions” that \neither “(i) were promulgated or are administered by the agency under Title VII or any other statute \nor regulation that prohibits sex discrimination, including any that relate to the agency’s own \ncompliance with such statutes or regulations” or “(ii) are or may be inconsistent with the policy \nset forth” in the Executive Order.  Id. \n64.  President Biden further directed that the “head of each agency shall, as soon \nas practicable, also consider whether there are additional actions that the agency should take to \nensure that it is fully implementing the policy” set forth in the Executive Order.  Id. \n13 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 13 of 54   PageID #: 13\n\n65.  Finally, President Biden directed that, within “100 days of the date of this \norder, the head of each agency shall develop, in consultation with the Attorney General, as \nappropriate, a plan to carry out actions that the agency has identified.”  Id. \n66.  On March 26, 2021, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice \n(“DOJ”) released a memorandum concluding that Title IX “prohibit[s] discrimination on the basis \nof gender identity and sexual orientation.”  DOJ, Memorandum Regarding Application of Bostock \nv.  Clayton  County  to  Title  IX  of  the  Education  Amendments  of  1972  (Mar.  26,  2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/2WpV5zq (“DOJ Memorandum”). \n67.  The DOJ Memorandum relied primarily on two post-Bostock cases.  In the \nfirst, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a school district \nviolated Title IX by using sex-separated bathrooms.  Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d \n586, 616 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020), cert. denied 141 S. Ct. 2878 (with Justices \nThomas and Alito noting that they would have granted the petition for writ of certiorari). \n68.  The second opinion the DOJ Memorandum relied on was Adams v. School \nBoard of St. Johns County, 968 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir. 2020), but it is no longer of any effect.  It was \nsubsequently replaced by the panel with a narrower one that “d[id] not reach the Title IX question,” \nAdams v. School Board of St. Johns County, 3 F.4th 1299, 1304 (11th Cir. 2021).  The Eleventh \nCircuit then granted rehearing en banc and vacated even the narrower opinion.  Adams v. Sch. Bd. \nof St. Johns Cnty., 9 F.4th 1369 (11th Cir. 2021). \n69.  The  DOJ  Memorandum  was  contrary  to  what  the  author  of  the  DOJ \nMemorandum, Pamela Karlan, told the U.S. Supreme Court during oral argument in Bostock:  that \nsex-separated bathrooms are “not discriminatory because” no one is “subjected to a disadvantage.”  \n14 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 14 of 54   PageID #: 14\n\nTr. of Oral Arg. at 12-13, Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) (Nos. 17-1618, 17-\n1623). \n70.  Despite her representation of private parties in Bostock, Pamela Karlan did \nnot recuse herself from authoring the DOJ Memorandum.  Karlan recently resigned from DOJ \namid reports that she was earning nearly $1 million a year from Stanford University while \nemployed at DOJ.

The U.S. Department of Education has also engaged in at least two agency \nactions to implement President Biden’s executive order. \n72.  First,  on  June  22,  2021,  the  Department  of  Education  published  an \ninterpretation of Title IX in the Federal Register.  See Enforcement of Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 with Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender \nIdentity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021) (“Department \nof Education Interpretation”). \n73.  The Department of Education acknowledged that it “at times has stated that \nTitle IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination does not encompass discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity.”  Id.  \n74.  Earlier in 2021, the Department of Education concluded that Bostock did \nnot apply to Title IX or require a different interpretation of Title IX.  See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nMemorandum for Kimberly M. Richey Acting Assistant Secretary of the Office for Civil Rights \nRe: Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) (Jan. 8, 2021), https://bit.ly/3mwKI7H.   \n15 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 15 of 54   PageID #: 15\n\n75.  The Department of Education’s current view, however, is that “Title IX \nProhibits Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.”  Department of \nEducation Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,637. \n76.  The Department of Education applied Bostock’s Title VII interpretation to \nTitle IX.  See id. at 32,638 (“Bostock’s Application to Title IX”); see also id. (“[T]he Department \nhas determined that the interpretation of sex discrimination set out by the Supreme Court in \nBostock—that discrimination ‘because of . . . sex’ encompasses discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity—properly guides the Department’s interpretation of discrimination \n‘on  the  basis  of  sex’  under  Title  IX  and  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  Title  IX  prohibits \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.”).  \n77.  The  Department  of  Education  first  concluded  that  “[t]here  is  textual \nsimilarity between Title VII and Title IX.”  Id. \n78.  The texts of Title VII and Title IX are materially different:  \n• Title VII: “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer (1) to \nfail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate \nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or \nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex[] . . . ; or (2) to \nlimit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any \nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment \nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of \nsuch individual’s . . . sex . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).  \n \n• Title IX: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . \n. .” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n \n79.   Nevertheless, the Department of Education concluded that the phrase “on \nthe basis of sex” in Title IX has the same meaning as the phrase “because of . . . sex” in Title VII.  \nDepartment of Education Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,638. \n16 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 16 of 54   PageID #: 16\n\n80.  The Department of Education also cited decisions from federal courts of \nappeals  that  “recognize  that  Title  IX’s  prohibition  on  sex  discrimination  encompasses \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.”  Id. at 32,639 (collecting cases). \n81.  The  Department  of  Education  omitted  any  mention  of  or  citation  to \ndecisions from federal courts of appeals recognizing that “Title VII differs from Title IX in \nimportant respects” and that “principles announced in the Title VII context [do not] automatically \napply in the Title IX context.”  Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021) (noting \nthat, “under Title IX, universities must consider sex in allocating athletic scholarships, 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.37(c), and may take it into account in ‘maintaining separate living facilities for the different \nsexes.’ 20 U.S.C. § 1686.”); cf. Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) \n(“[T]he Court in Bostock was clear on the narrow reach of its decision and how it was limited only \nto Title VII itself.”). \n82.  The Department of Education further “conclude[d] that the interpretation \nset forth in this document is most consistent with the purpose of Title IX, which is to ensure equal \nopportunity and to protect individuals from the harms of sex discrimination.”  Department of \nEducation Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,639.  \n83.  The Department of Education also noted that the “U.S. Department of \nJustice’s Civil Rights Division has concluded that Bostock’s analysis applies to Title IX.”  Id.  \n84.  The Department of Education failed to mention that, just two months before \nthe DOJ reached that conclusion about Bostock, it had reached the exact opposite conclusion.  DOJ, \nMemorandum for the Civil Rights Division Regarding Application of Bostock v. Clayton County 4 \n(Jan. 17, 2021) (“Bostock does not require any changes to . . . sex-specific facilities or policies.”). \n17 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 17 of 54   PageID #: 17\n\n85.  Finally, the Department of Education declared that it “will fully enforce \nTitle IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in education \nprograms  and  activities  that  receive  Federal  financial  assistance  from  the  Department.”  \nDepartment of Education Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,638.  \n86.  The Department of Education also declared that its Interpretation “will \nguide the Department in processing complaints and conducting investigations.”  Id. at 32,639.  \n87.  Second, on June 23, 2021, Acting Assistant Secretary Suzanne B. Goldberg \nissued a “Dear Educator” Letter notifying Title IX recipients of the Department of Education \nInterpretation  and  reiterating  that  the  Department  “will  fully  enforce  Title  IX  to  prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.”  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Letter to \nEducators on Title IX’s 49th Anniversary (June 23, 2021), https://bit.ly/3ksLLDj (“Dear Educator \nLetter”).  \n88.  The Dear Educator Letter was accompanied by a “fact sheet” issued by the \nCivil Rights Division of the DOJ and the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) at the Department of \nEducation.  DOJ & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools (June \n2021), https://bit.ly/3sQjZnM (“Fact Sheet”).  \n89.  The  Fact  Sheet  purports  to  provide  examples  of  what  constitutes \ndiscrimination under Title IX.  \n90.  Bostock did not address any of the examples of purported discrimination \nidentified in the Fact Sheet.  \n91.  In particular, the Fact Sheet indicates that preventing a transgender high \nschool girl (a biological male) from using the girls’ restroom would constitute discrimination.  See \n18 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 18 of 54   PageID #: 18\n\nFact Sheet at 1.  Bostock expressly declined to resolve any questions about bathrooms, locker \nrooms, or the like.  140 S. Ct. at 1737.  \n92.  The Fact Sheet also indicates that preventing a transgender high school girl \n(a  biological  male)  from  “try[ing]  out  for  the  girls’  cheerleading  team”  would  constitute \ndiscrimination.  Fact Sheet at 1.  Bostock did not address athletics.  \n93.  The Fact Sheet suggests that failing to use a transgender student’s preferred \nname or pronouns would constitute discrimination.  See id.  Bostock did not address that issue.  \n94.  Plaintiffs operate and are home to programs and activities subject to Title \nIX, and thus the Department of Education has pledged to enforce its Title IX interpretation against \nPlaintiffs.  \n95.  On June 17, 2021, for example, the Department of Education and DOJ filed \na statement of interest in which they took the position that Title IX prohibits West Virginia from \n“categorically exclud[ing] transgender girls from participating in single-sex sports restricted to \ngirls.”  Statement of Interest of the United States at 1, B.P.J. v. W.V. State Bd. of Educ., No. 2:21-\ncv-00316 (S.D. W. Va. June 17, 2021), ECF No. 42 (footnote omitted).  \n96.  In response, States sued to enjoin these and other unlawful regulatory \nactions of President Biden’s Administration.  See Tennessee. v. U.S. Dept. of Educ., No. 3:21-cv-\n308 (E.D. Tenn.) (States’ preliminary injunction motion granted and federal government’s motion \nto dismiss denied on July 15, 2022); Texas v. EEOC, No. 2:21-CV-194-Z (N.D. Tex.) (federal \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss denied on May 26, 2022). \n97.  The  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Tennessee  has \npreliminarily  enjoined  the  Department  of  Education  from  enforcing  its  Interpretation,  Dear \nEducator Letter, and Fact Sheet against Tennessee, Indiana, and 18 other States because those \n19 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 19 of 54   PageID #: 19\n\ndocuments violated the APA by “creat[ing] rights for students and obligations for regulated entities \nnot to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity that appear nowhere in Bostock, \nTitle IX, or its implementing regulations.”  Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., No. 3:21-cv-308, 2022 \nWL 2791450, at *21 (E.D. Tenn. July 15, 2022). \n98.  While those cases remain pending, President Biden continues to threaten \nStates if they do not capitulate to the Federal Government’s rewriting of Title IX and other statutes. \n99.  For example, a few months ago, the Biden Administration emphasized its \ncommitment to “combatting” what it calls “legislative attacks on transgender kids at the state \nlevel.”  White House, Fact Sheet: Biden-Harris Administration Advances Equality and Visibility \nTransgender Americans (Mar. 31, 2022), https://bit.ly/3PeX5Rh. \n100.  President Biden has told the American public that “the onslaught of anti-\ntransgender laws . . . is simply wrong” and that his “administration is standing up . . . against all \nthese hateful bills.”  White House, President Biden on Transgender Day of Visibility 2022 (Mar. \n31, 2022), https://bit.ly/3OIfJRt.  \n101.  Because Congress has declined the Biden Administration’s call to rewrite \nTitle IX and other statutes, Defendants are “expanding Federal non-discrimination protections” \nthrough  acts  such  as  these  regulations  masquerading  as  mere  guidance.    White  House,  A \nProclamation on Transgender Day of Visibility, 2022 (Mar. 30, 2022), https://bit.ly/3yea26Z. \n102.  According to President Biden, people are “made in the image of God” as \n“transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming.”  Id. \n103.  In June 2022, President Biden released yet another executive order.  See \nAdvancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Individuals, \nExec. Order No. 14,075, 87 Fed. Reg. 37,189 (June 15, 2022). \n20 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 20 of 54   PageID #: 20\n\n104.  The executive order was designed to combat what it misleadingly calls \n“unrelenting political and legislative attacks at the State level—on LGBTQI+ children and families \nin particular”—that “threaten the civil rights gains of the last half century and put LGBTQI+ \npeople at risk.”  Id. at 37,189; see also White House, Remarks by President Biden at a Pride Month \nReception and Signing of an Executive Order on Advancing LGBTQI+ Individuals (June 15, \n2022), https://bit.ly/3nu2Q1w (alleging that “[t]hree hundred discriminatory bills introduced in \nstates  across  the  country”  are  part  of  “the  ultra-MAGA  agenda  attacking  families  and  our \nfreedoms”). \n105.  The Biden Administration’s sweeping rhetoric treats normal practices, such \nas  sex-separated  bathrooms  and  athletics,  as  “discriminatory”  even  though  DOJ  and  the \nDepartment of Education treated those as legal, nondiscriminatory practices as recently as last \nyear. \n106.  As  part  of  the  new  executive  order,  President  Biden  has  directed  the \nDepartment of Education to “use the Department of Education’s authorities to support LGBTQI+ \nstudents, their families, educators, and other school personnel targeted by harmful State and local \nlaws and practices, and shall promote the adoption of promising policies and practices to support \nthe safety, well-being, and rights of LGBTQI+ students.”  Exec. Order No. 14,075, 87 Fed. Reg. \nat 37,190.  “Within 200 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall develop and \nrelease sample policies for supporting LGBTQI+ students’ well-being and academic success in \nschools and educational institutions.”  Id. \nD.  The USDA’s Unlawful Actions. \n107.  Because the Department of Education has so far not prevailed in the States’ \nlawsuits  against  its  Interpretation,  Dear  Educator  Letter,  and  Fact  Sheet,  President  Biden’s \n21 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 21 of 54   PageID #: 21\n\nAdministration seemingly decided to use the USDA to accomplish its rewriting of Title IX through \nother means.  In early May 2022, the Department issued the Memorandum directing States to \nincorporate its misapplication of Bostock into their Federal-State Agreements with USDA.  See \nMemorandum at 1-2, https://bit.ly/3NuXnSx.  In doing so, the Department relied on its misreading \nof Bostock and Executive Order 13,988 to determine “that discrimination based on gender identity \nand sexual orientation can constitute prohibited sex discrimination under Title IX and the Food \nand Nutrition Act.”  Id. at 2.  \n108.  In  the  Memorandum,  the  USDA  expressly  adopts  the  DOJ’s  and  the \nDepartment of Education’s analyses “concluding that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination \nincludes a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.”  \nId. (citing DOJ Memorandum; now-enjoined Department of Education Interpretation). \n109.  The USDA directed state agencies and program operators to “expeditiously \nreview their program discrimination complaint procedures and make any changes necessary to \nensure complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation \nare processed and evaluated as complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex” and directed that \nStates “distribute this memorandum to local agencies, Program Operators and Sponsors, and all \nother subrecipients of Federal financial assistance.”  Memorandum at 3.  \n110.  Attached to the Memorandum was a “questions and answers” document, \nwhich directs States to “update their program discrimination complaint processing procedures for \nallegations related to service and activities receiving federal financial assistance from the USDA \nto ensure discrimination complaints alleging sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination \nare processed as complaints of prohibited sex discrimination.”  Memorandum Q&A at 2.  \n22 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 22 of 54   PageID #: 22\n\n111.  The Memorandum Q&A also asserted that these regulatory changes were \n“effective immediately” and that “additional guidance is forthcoming.”  Id.  \n112.  Soon  after  issuing  the  Memorandum  and  Memorandum  Q&A,  the \nDepartment issued its “additional guidance” in the form of a Supplemental Memorandum, which \nimposed  new  obligations  going  far  above  and  well  beyond  the  “complaint  procedure” \nrequirements.   \n113.  Those  obligations,  which  related  to  program  posters  and \n“Nondiscrimination Statements,” laid bare the Department’s novel and expansive new view of \nSNAP governance.  Consistent with its other pronouncements, the Department would prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of “gender identity” and “sexual orientation,” not just “sex.”  But more \nimportantly, where the old policy prohibited discrimination only “in any program or activity \nconducted or funded by USDA,” the new policy seemingly applies to each program-administering \n“institution” as a whole. \n114.  Though there is a grace period of not issuing findings related to a state \nagency’s inability to display the new posters and statements, there is no grace period for “accepting \nand processing discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation and gender identity” in \nSNAP or other Food and Nutrition Service programs.  Memorandum Q&A at 3. \n115.  Perhaps in recognition of the procedural flaws with the Memoranda, the \nDepartment decided to dust off the long-shelved Proposed Rule.  The Department repurposed the \nProposed Rule and used it to address issues nowhere contemplated in the original notice.  See Final \nRule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855, https://bit.ly/3bDC4RA. \n116.  The Proposed Rule, which went through the notice and comment process \nover five years ago, was promulgated in 2016 and never went into effect.  As noted above, the \n23 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 23 of 54   PageID #: 23\n\nProposed Rule received only five public comments, none of which addressed sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  See Comments to Proposed Rule, FNS-2016-0078-0002 to -0006, (posted Feb. 5, \n2017), https://bit.ly/3v5Iv6Y.  \n117.  The Department, using the 2016 Proposed Rule, inserted new language \ndefining sex discrimination under Title IX as including sexual orientation and gender identity when \nit issued the Final Rule.  Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857.  The Department made this change \nwithout providing an opportunity for public comment on this new language. \n118.  In the process of recycling the Proposed Rule, the Department made a \nsubstantive change to the Final Rule requiring States to adopt language in their Federal-State \nAgreements to “[c]omply with . . . Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 \net seq.) . . . to the effect that, no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of sex, including \ngender identity and sexual orientation, race, color, age political belief, religious creed, disability \nor national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise \nsubject to discrimination under SNAP.”  Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857 (emphasis added). \n119.  States were provided with neither notice nor an opportunity to provide \npublic comment on the Final Rule’s expansion of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act to \ninclude discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.   \n120.  The expansion of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act will affect the \nStates’ administration of SNAP.  \nE.  The USDA Memoranda and Final Rule Irreparably Harm Plaintiff States \n121.  The USDA’s Memorandum requires “State agencies” to “expeditiously \nreview their program discrimination complaint procedures and make any changes necessary to \nensure complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation \n24 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 24 of 54   PageID #: 24\n\nare processed and evaluated as complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Memorandum \nat 3. \n122.   The USDA’s Memorandum Q&A reiterates that “State agencies . . . have \nto update their program discrimination complaint processing procedures for allegations related to \nservices  and  activities  receiving  federal  financial  assistance  from  the  USDA  to  ensure \ndiscrimination complaints  alleging sexual  orientation  and gender identity discrimination are \nprocessed as complaints of prohibited sex discrimination.”  Memorandum Q&A at 2.  And it states \nthat “there will not be a grace period.”  Id. at 3. \n123.  The USDA’s Final Rule states that, to enter into any SNAP agreement, \nStates must agree to prevent discrimination “on the grounds of sex, including gender identity and \nsexual orientation.”  Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,857. \n124.  Plaintiffs face an immediate requirement (“120 days after the publication of \nthe regulations in final form”) to accept the Final Rule’s terms in SNAP Federal-State Agreements. \n125.  Plaintiffs  also  face  an  imminent  deadline  for  the  2023  Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program – Nutrition Education (SNAP-Ed).  That program requires State \nentities to make incorporate the new USDA non-discrimination statement and policies to various \nprojects and requires inclusion of certain non-discrimination statements to use federal funds.  See \nFY 2023 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education Plan Guidance, U.S. Department \nof Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, at 77, 159 (May 10, 2022), https://bit.ly/3IJLWWu \n(adopting the new USDA nondiscrimination statement and providing general guidance for FY \n2023 and setting the deadline for submission as August 15, 2022).    \n126.  Plaintiffs thus face an immediate threat that the USDA will enforce the Final \nRule against Plaintiffs.  \n25 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 25 of 54   PageID #: 25\n\n127.  The Memoranda Q&A state that “there will not be a grace period” for \nchanging discrimination complaint procedures.  Memorandum Q&A at 3. \n128.  Plaintiffs thus face an immediate threat that the USDA will enforce the \nMemoranda against Plaintiffs. \n129.  The USDA stated that it would “ensur[e] consistent and robust enforcement \nof Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act.”  Memorandum at 2. \n130.  Plaintiff the State of Tennessee maintains laws or policies that at least \narguably conflict with the USDA’s Memoranda and Final Rule.  See, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-\n6-310 (providing that “[a] student’s gender for purposes of participation in a public middle school \nor high school interscholastic athletic activity or event must be determined by the student’s sex at \nthe time of the student’s birth”); id. § 49-2-805 (giving public school students, teachers, and \nemployees a private right of action against a school that “intentionally allow[s] a member of the \nopposite sex to enter [a] multi-occupancy restroom or changing facility while other persons [are] \npresent”); id. § 49-6-2904(b)(2) (providing students a right to “[e]xpress religious viewpoints in a \npublic school”); id. § 49-7-2405(a)(2), (a)(10) (providing, with certain limitations, that public \nhigher educational institutions in Tennessee “shall be committed to giving students the broadest \npossible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, learn, and discuss any issue” and that “no faculty \nwill face adverse employment action for classroom speech”).  \n131.  Other Plaintiff States also maintain laws or policies that at least arguably \nconflict with Memoranda and Final Rule.  See, e.g., Ala. Code § 16-1-52(a)(2) (providing that “[a] \npublic K-12 school may not allow a biological female to participate on a male team if there is a \nfemale team in a sport” or “allow a biological male to participate on a female team”); Alaska Stat. \n§ 14.18.040 (allowing schools to provide “[s]eparate school-sponsored teams . . . for each sex”); \n26 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 26 of 54   PageID #: 26\n\nArk.

Enforcement of the USDA’s Memoranda or a refusal to accept the Final \nRule’s terms could cause Plaintiff States to lose significant federal funds from the USDA.  \n133.  Because  the  Memoranda  and  Final  Rule  appear  to  stretch  beyond \ncompliance with the Food and Nutrition Act and may impact Plaintiff States’ Title IX policies \nmore generally, the USDA’s actions could trigger Title IX enforcement action by the Department \nof Education, which also enforces Title IX. \n134.  The Memoranda and Final Rule, with their rewriting of Title IX, could \ncause Plaintiff States to lose significant federal funds.  \n135.  Plaintiffs adopted their laws and policies, and established sex-separated \nrestrooms, locker rooms, showers, residence halls, and other living facilities in reliance on their \nunderstanding that Title IX does not (and could not) prohibit those laws, policies, and practices.  \nThis understanding was based on the text of Title IX itself, longstanding federal regulations, and \nprior guidance—including initial post-Bostock guidance from the Department of Education and \nthe DOJ. \n136.  The Memoranda and Final Rule undermine Plaintiffs’ reliance interests and \ncreate regulatory uncertainty for Plaintiffs and other regulated entities.  \n137.  Adopting the Memoranda and Final Rule just weeks before the beginning \nof the new school year would also undermine Plaintiffs’ reliance interests and create significant \n28 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 28 of 54   PageID #: 28\n\nlogistical obstacles to ensure compliance.  Plaintiffs would incur significant administrative and \ncompliance costs if forced to comply with the Memoranda and Final Rule.   \n138.  The  Memoranda  and  Final  Rule  interfere  with  Plaintiffs’  sovereign \nauthority to enforce and administer their laws and to carry out important government functions.  \n139.  The Memoranda and Final Rule impose immediate administrative  and \ncompliance costs and burdens on Plaintiffs and other regulated entities.  \n140.  The  Memoranda  and  Final  Rule  violate  the  protections  of  the  First \nAmendment, and it is well settled that “[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal \nperiods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn \nv. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted).   \nCOUNT I \nUSDA Memoranda Are \nAgency Action Without Observance of Procedures Required by Law \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n \n141.  The allegations in all preceding Paragraphs are reincorporated herein.  \n142.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires courts to “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . (A) arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right; [or] (D) without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)-(D).  \n143.  The  USDA’s  Memoranda  are  final  agency  actions  subject  to  judicial \nreview.  Id. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n144.  The USDA’s Memoranda impose “rules” under the APA.  Id. § 701(b)(2).  \n145.  The USDA is an “agency” under the APA.  Id. § 701(b)(1).  \n29 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 29 of 54   PageID #: 29\n\n146.  The  APA  requires  agencies  to  engage  in  “notice  and  comment”  for \nlegislative rules.  Id. § 553(b).  \n147.  The USDA’s Memoranda are legislative rules because they “intend[] to \ncreate new law, rights or duties” and thus should have been subject to notice and comment.  Tenn. \nHosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting Michigan v. Thomas, 805 F.2d \n176, 183 (6th Cir. 1986)).  \n148.  The Memoranda “seek[] to amend, rather than merely clarify,” what Title \nIX requires.  Id. at 1043.  \n149.  The Memoranda “effec[t] a substantive change in the regulations” the \nUSDA has already issued—and any agency action that “adopt[s] a new position inconsistent with \nany of the Secretary’s existing regulations” is a legislative rule requiring notice and comment.  Id. \nat 1042 (first alteration in original) (quoting Shalala v. Guernsey Mem’l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 100 \n(1995)).  \n150.  Because the Memoranda are legislative rules that were adopted without the \nrequired notice-and-comment procedures, they are unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2).  \nCOUNT II \nUSDA Final Rule Is \nAgency Action Without Observance of Procedures Required by Law \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n \n151.  The allegations in all preceding Paragraphs are reincorporated herein.  \n152.  The APA requires an agency engaging in notice-and-comment rulemaking \nto publish in its notice of proposed rulemaking “either the terms or substance of the proposed rule \nor a description of the subjects and issues involved.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3). \n30 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 30 of 54   PageID #: 30\n\n153.  To satisfy that requirement, an agency’s final action must be a logical \noutgrowth of its proposed rule. \n154.  The USDA’s Proposed Rule made no mention of gender identity or sexual \norientation. \n155.  The USDA’s Proposed Rule did not provide notice that it intended to \nimpose  requirements  related  to  “discrimination”  on  the  basis  of  gender  identity  or  sexual \norientation. \n156.  The USDA’s Final Rule imposes non-discrimination requirements that \ninclude “discrimination” on the basis of “gender identity and sexual orientation.”  Final Rule, 87 \nFed. Reg. at 35,857. \n157.  The USDA’s Final Rule is not a logical outgrowth of its notice of proposed \nrulemaking. \n158.  The USDA failed to provide adequate notice and a fair opportunity for \ncomment as required by the APA. \n159.  Because the Final Rule failed to properly comply with the required notice-\nand-comment procedures, it is unlawful and should be vacated or “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nCOUNT III \nUSDA Memoranda Are \nAgency Action That Is Arbitrary and Capricious \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n160.

(alteration in original) (quoting Nat’l Cable & Telecomm. Ass’n v. Brand X \nInternet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 981 (2005)).  \n164.  The USDA’s Memoranda are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law because the USDA concurs with and adopts the DOJ’s \nand Department of Education’s analyses of Title IX with no explanation.  \n165.  The USDA’s Memoranda are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law because the USDA failed to consider the Memoranda’s \neffect on the reliance and religious interests of the regulated parties, alternatives that would avoid \na rushed enforcement time before the new school year begins, and federalism interests of States, \namong other things. \n166.  The USDA’s Memoranda are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law because the USDA fails to acknowledge that those \nanalyses were changes in position from existing regulations and initial post-Bostock guidance.  \nMoreover,  the  USDA  fails  to  acknowledge  that  the  States  are  challenging  those  DOJ  and \nDepartment of Education analyses of Title IX in the federal courts or that the authority cited in \nthose analyses has been weakened. \n32 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 32 of 54   PageID #: 32\n\n167.  The USDA’s Memoranda are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law because their purported clarifications are premised on a \nmisreading and unwarranted extension of Bostock.  The USDA cannot point to Bostock to justify \nits  interpretations  because  Bostock  concerned  only  Title  VII;  Bostock  expressly  disclaimed \napplication to “other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination”—like Title IX and the \nFood and Nutrition Act—and expressly did not “prejudge any such questions.”  140 S. Ct. at 1753.  \nSince “Title VII differs from Title IX in important respects,” “it does not follow that principles \nannounced in the Title VII context automatically apply in the Title IX context.”  Meriwether, 992 \nF.3d at 510 n.4. \n168.  Because the USDA’s Memoranda are arbitrary and capricious, they are \nunlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nCOUNT IV \nUSDA Final Rule Is \nAgency Action That Is Arbitrary and Capricious \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n169.

(alteration in original) (quoting Brand X, 545 U.S. at 981).  \n173.  The USDA’s Final Rule is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law because the USDA incorporates the DOJ’s and Department \nof Education’s analyses of Title IX with no explanation.  \n174.  The USDA’s Final Rule is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law because the USDA failed to consider its effect on the reliance \nand religious interests of the regulated parties, alternatives that would avoid a rushed enforcement \ntime before the new school year begins, and federalism interests of States, among other things. \n175.  The USDA’s Final Rule is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law because the USDA fails to acknowledge its change in \nposition from existing regulations and initial post-Bostock guidance.

The USDA’s Memoranda are “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n37 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 37 of 54   PageID #: 37\n\nauthority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because they violate the Spending Clause of \nthe U.S. Constitution.  \n200.  The Spending Clause authorizes Congress to “attach conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds,” but the “spending power is of course not unlimited.”  South Dakota v. \nDole, 483 U.S. 203, 206-07 (1987).  \n201.  One such limit is that, “if Congress desires to condition the States’ receipt \nof federal funds, it ‘must do so unambiguously, enabling the States to exercise their choice \nknowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.”  Id. at 207 (cleaned up) (quoting \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.

Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, \n578 (2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  \n203.

Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (quoting Pennhurst, \n451 U.S. at 17).  \n204.

The Spending Clause authorizes Congress to “attach conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds,” but the “spending power is of course not unlimited.”  Dole, 483 U.S. at \n206-07.  \n209.  One such limit is that, “if Congress desires to condition the States’ receipt \nof federal funds, it ‘must do so unambiguously, enabling the States to exercise their choice \nknowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.”  Id. at 207 (cleaned up) (quoting \nPennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17).  \n210.

See NFIB, 567 U.S. at 587 \n(opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  \n213.  Because the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause, it is unlawful and \nshould be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nCOUNT XI \nUSDA Memoranda Are \nAgency Action That Violates the Spending Clause and First Amendment \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, U.S. Const. amend. I \n214.  The allegations in all preceding Paragraphs are reincorporated herein.  \n215.  The USDA’s Memoranda are “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because they violate the First Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution, condition the receipt of federal funds on recipients violating the First \nAmendment rights of others, and condition existing funding on new and unexpected restrictions \non recipients’ First Amendment rights. \n216.  The Sixth Circuit has held that requiring a state university professor to use \na transgender student’s preferred pronouns violates the professor’s First Amendment rights.  See \nMeriwether, 992 F.3d at 511-12. \n217.  The Memoranda also conflict with the First Amendment’s protection of \nreligious liberty. \n40 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 40 of 54   PageID #: 40\n\n218.  The Memoranda infringe on Plaintiffs’ sovereign authority to enact and \nenforce laws that protect the First Amendment rights of their citizens. \n219.  To the extent the Memoranda require Plaintiffs to adopt policies or engage \nin  conduct  that  would  infringe  on  First  Amendment  rights,  the  Memoranda  impose \nunconstitutional conditions on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal funds.  See, e.g., Dole, 483 U.S. at 210 \n(explaining that the spending power “may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities \nthat would themselves be unconstitutional”). \n220.  Plaintiffs also have First Amendment rights, which include the right not to \nexpress messages they do not want to express.  See Walker v. Tex. Div., Sons of Confederate \nVeterans, Inc., 576 U.S. 200, 219-20 (2015).  That is particularly true regarding speech on \ncontroversial topics such as sexual orientation and gender identity.  See Bongo Prods., LLC v. \nLawrence, No. 3:21-cv-00490, 2022 WL 1557664, at *1, *16-17 (M.D. Tenn. May 17, 2022). \n221.  The Memoranda would force Plaintiffs to post posters, rewrite policies, \nenforce policies, and otherwise engage in actions that express messages Plaintiffs do not agree \nwith. \n222.  The Memoranda seem to force Plaintiffs and their employees to engage in \nbiologically inaccurate speech and to forbid biologically accurate speech due to the USDA’s \nessentially moral judgment on the meaning of “sex.” See Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 106 \n(1968). \n223.  Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act did not clearly impose such a \ncurtailing of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, and the Memoranda place significant federal \nfunding in jeopardy if Plaintiffs’ do not express these newly required messages. \n41 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 41 of 54   PageID #: 41\n\n224.  Because the USDA’s Memoranda violate the First Amendment and impose \nunconstitutional conditions on federal funding, they are unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT XII \nUSDA Final Rule Is \nAgency Action That Violates the Spending Clause and First Amendment \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, U.S. Const. amend. I \n \n225.  The allegations in all preceding Paragraphs are reincorporated herein.  \n226.  The USDA’s Final Rule is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because it violates the First Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution, conditions the receipt of federal funds on recipients violating the First \nAmendment rights of others, and conditions existing funding on new and unexpected restrictions \non recipients’ First Amendment rights. \n227.  The Sixth Circuit has held that requiring a state university professor to use \na transgender student’s preferred pronouns violates the professor’s First Amendment rights.  See \nMeriwether, 992 F.3d at 511-12. \n228.  The Final Rule also conflicts with the First Amendment’s protection of \nreligious liberty. \n229.  The Final Rule infringes on Plaintiffs’ sovereign authority to enact and \nenforce laws that protect the First Amendment rights of their citizens. \n230.  To the extent the Final Rule requires Plaintiffs to adopt policies or engage \nin conduct that would infringe on First Amendment rights, the Final Rule imposes unconstitutional \nconditions on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal funds.  See, e.g., Dole, 483 U.S. at 210 (explaining that \n42 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 42 of 54   PageID #: 42\n\nthe spending power “may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities that would \nthemselves be unconstitutional”). \n231.  Plaintiffs also have First Amendment rights, which include the right not to \nexpress messages they do not want to express.  See Walker, 576 U.S. at 219-20.  That is particularly \ntrue regarding speech on controversial topics such as sexual orientation and gender identity.  See \nBongo Prods, 2022 WL 1557664, at *1, *16-17. \n232.  The Final Rule would force Plaintiffs to post posters, rewrite policies, \nenforce policies, and otherwise engage in actions that express messages Plaintiffs do not agree \nwith. \n233.  The Final Rule seems to force Plaintiffs and their employees to engage in \nbiologically inaccurate speech and to forbid biologically accurate speech due to the USDA’s \nessentially moral judgment on the meaning of “sex.” See Epperson, 393 U.S. at 106. \n234.  Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act did not clearly impose such a \ncurtailing of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, and the Final Rule places significant federal \nfunding in jeopardy if Plaintiffs do not express these newly required messages. \n235.  Because the USDA’s Final Rule violates the First Amendment and imposes \nunconstitutional conditions on federal funding, it is unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2). \nCOUNT XIII \nUSDA Memoranda Are \nAgency Action That Violates the Tenth Amendment and the Anticommandeering Doctrine \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. amend. X \n236.  The allegations in all preceding Paragraphs are reincorporated herein.  \n237.  The USDA’s Memoranda are “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n43 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 43 of 54   PageID #: 43\n\nauthority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because they violate the Tenth Amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution, see U.S. Const. amend. X (“The powers not delegated to the United States \nby the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to \nthe people.”); Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947) (explaining that Congress \nmust make “clear and manifest” its purpose to supersede powers historically reserved to the \nStates).  \n238.  The  Tenth  Amendment  and  structure  of  the  Constitution  also  deprive \nCongress of “the “the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States,” Murphy v. \nNCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1476 (2018), and forbid the federal government from commandeering \nstate officers “into administering federal law,” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 928 (1997). \n239.  The Memoranda commandeer Plaintiffs and their employees into enforcing \nfederal policy by threatening Plaintiff States’ SNAP funding and funding for entities subject to \nTitle IX.  If the Memoranda are left in effect, Plaintiff States have no real choice but to allow their \nemployees to be commandeered and used to enforce the Department’s policy. \n240.  Because the Department’s Memoranda violate the Tenth Amendment, they \nare unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nCOUNT XIV \nUSDA Final Rule Is \nAgency Action That Violates the Tenth Amendment and the Anticommandeering Doctrine \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. amend.

The USDA’s Final Rule is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because it violates the Tenth Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution, see U.S. Const. amend. X (“The powers not delegated to the United States \n44 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 44 of 54   PageID #: 44\n\nby the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to \nthe people.”); Rice, 331 U.S. at 230 (explaining that Congress must make “clear and manifest” its \npurpose to supersede powers historically reserved to the States).  \n243.  The  Tenth  Amendment  and  structure  of  the  Constitution  also  deprive \nCongress of “the “the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States,” Murphy, 138 \nS. Ct. at 1476, and forbid the federal government from commandeering State officers “into \nadministering federal law,” Printz, 521 U.S. at 928. \n244.  The Final Rule commandeers Plaintiffs and their employees into enforcing \nfederal policy by threatening Plaintiff States’ SNAP funding and funding for entities subject to \nTitle IX.  If the Final Rule is left in effect, Plaintiff States have no real choice but to allow their \nemployees to be commandeered and used to enforce the Department’s policy. \n245.  Because the Department’s Final Rule violates the Tenth Amendment and \nthe Anticommandeering Doctrine, it is unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nCOUNT XV \nUSDA Memoranda Are \nAgency Action That Violates the Separation of Powers and the Non-Delegation Doctrine  \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 1 \n \n246.  The allegations in all preceding Paragraphs are reincorporated herein.  \n247.  The USDA’s Memoranda are “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because they are so removed from any \nreasonable  reading  of  Title  IX  and  the  Food  and  Nutrition  Act  that  they  amount  to  an \nunconstitutional exercise of legislative power, see U.S. Const. art. I, § 1 (“All legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in . . . Congress.”). \n45 \n   \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 07/26/22   Page 45 of 54   PageID #: 45\n\n248.   Under  U.S.  Supreme  Court  precedent,  “a  statutory  delegation  is \nconstitutional as long as Congress lays down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which \nthe person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform.”  Gundy \nv. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019).  Congress must offer “specific restrictions” that \n“meaningfully constrain[]” the agency’s exercise of authority.  Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. \n160, 166-67 (1991).   \n249.  Moreover, Congress must “speak clearly when authorizing an agency to \nexercise powers of vast economic and political significance.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of \nHealth & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (quotation omitted); see West Virginia v. \nEPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2607-10 (2022).  Both the “separation of powers principles and a practical \nunderstanding of legislative intent” require that a federal agency “must point to clear congressional \nauthorization for the authority it claims.”  Id. at 2609 (quotation omitted).    \n250.  Congress did not clearly delegate to the Department the authority to resolve \nthis major question or to rewrite Title IX or the Food and Nutrition Act as the Memoranda have \nattempted to do here, see id. at 2609-10, and any such delegation would be unconstitutional. \n251.  Because the Memoranda exceed the Department’s authority and violate \nseparation-of-powers principles and the non-delegation doctrine, they are unlawful and should be \n“set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nCOUNT XVI \nUSDA Final Rule Is \nAgency Action That Violates the Separation of Powers and the Non-Delegation Doctrine \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art.

The USDA’s Memoranda are unlawful because they are legislative rules \nthat did not undergo notice and comment.  \n260.  The USDA’s Memoranda are unlawful because they are arbitrary and \ncapricious.  \n261.  The USDA’s Memoranda are contrary to law because they violate Title IX, \nthe Food and Nutrition Act, and the Constitution.  \n262.  The Memoranda exceed the USDA’s statutory authorization. \n263.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the USDA’s Memoranda are \ninvalid and cannot be enforced against Plaintiffs.  \n264.  The USDA’s Final Rule is unlawful because the Department failed to \nprovide adequate notice and a fair opportunity for comment as required by the APA. \n265.  The USDA’s Final Rule is unlawful because it is arbitrary and capricious.  \n266.  The USDA’s Final Rule is contrary to law because it violates Title IX, the \nFood and Nutrition Act, and the Constitution.  \n267.  The Final Rule exceeds the USDA’s statutory authorization. \n268.

U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 3:21-CV-308, 2022 WL 2791450, \nat *21, *24 (E.D. Tenn. July 15, 2022), USDA dictated that Federal-State SNAP Agreements and \nother  documents  and  publications  all  list  “gender  identity”  and  “sexual  orientation”  as \ndiscrimination-protected characteristics.  See Doc. 1-5, Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. 35,855, 35,857 \n(June 14, 2022); Doc. 1-1, Memorandum at 2; Doc. 1-4, Supplemental Memorandum at 1-2.  And \nthe agency has not limited its new policy to “the certification of applicant households” for SNAP \nbenefits.  7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1).  Instead, it has required the States and their SNAP-administering \nagencies to implement this policy on the “institution[al]” level, reaching matters well beyond \nUSDA’s proper purview.  USDA, Food & Nutrition Serv. Nondiscrimination Statement (May 5, \n2022), https://bit.ly/3nZTc6W (“Nondiscrimination Statement”); see Doc. 1-3, Memorandum \nQ&A at 2-3 (requiring this new Nondiscrimination Statement). \nPressed to defend its actions in court, Defendants insist that USDA was “merely . . . \nremind[ing] stakeholders of the meaning of sex discrimination.”  Doc. 54, Opp. 1.  In the agency’s \nview, the States have simply “imagin[ed]” the broader sweep of its edicts, and there is thus no need \nfor a lawsuit.  Opp. 30.  If USDA’s litigating position matched its policies, the States might agree.  \nBut the actual terms of USDA’s Final Rule and Memoranda require far more than a commitment \nto “not deny [SNAP] benefits based on a household member’s sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.”  Doc. 1, Compl. ¶ 12.  So long as those documents are in force, the States have standing \nto challenge them, ripe claims for relief, and a pressing need for an injunction pending further \nlitigation. \n1 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 9 of 36   PageID #: 577\n\nARGUMENT \nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction to Adjudicate the States’ Claims. \nUSDA cannot evade review by challenging this Court’s jurisdiction.  The Final Rule and \nMemoranda regulate the States directly as administrators of the SNAP and SNAP-Ed programs.  \nAs a result of that direct regulation, the States have standing to challenge USDA’s new policy \ndirectives, and their claims ripened the day those directives issued.  Because the claims broadly \nattack USDA’s rules and rulemaking process—not some imminent or ongoing administrative \nadjudication—they fall outside the channeling provisions USDA raises as an obstacle to review. \nA.  The States have standing to challenge the USDA’s rules. \nUSDA’s standing arguments strain credulity.  The States’ standing is “self-evident” in this \ncase, Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002), because the States are \n“regulated . . . entit[ies]” challenging “illegal . . . rule[s] under which [they are] regulated,” State \nNat’l Bank of Big Spring v. Lew, 795 F.3d 48, 53 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561-62 (1992)).  Indeed, the States “are ‘the object[s] of’ [USDA’s] \nrequirement” that all SNAP administrators adopt new policies for processing discrimination \ncomplaints, West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2606 (2022) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-\n62); see Memorandum at 4, “objects” of USDA’s requirement that all Federal-State Agreements \nand program posters list “gender identity and sexual orientation” as protected characteristics, see \nDoc. 1-2, Cover Letter at 1; and, most importantly, “objects” of USDA’s requirement that all \nSNAP administrators refrain from gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination on the \n“institution[al]” level—not just in the administration of SNAP.  Nondiscrimination Statement.  \nEach of those requirements carries a “cost” associated with “compliance,” Sch. Dist. of Pontiac v. \nSec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 262 (6th Cir. 2009), and a burden on State autonomy, \n2 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 10 of 36   PageID #: 578\n\nsee Doc. 3, Br. 8.  There can thus “be ‘little question’ that the rule[s] . . . injure the States,” West \nVirginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2606, and this Court can redress those injuries by “set[ting] aside” the rules, \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nUSDA nonetheless insists that the States have sued over nothing more than “an abstract \ndisagreement”  because  the  States  “affirm  that  they  do  not  engage  in  discrimination  in  the \nadministration of SNAP on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.”  Opp. 14 (citing \nCompl. ¶¶ 12, 40; Br. 1, 17).  To be clear, the States do not “deny [SNAP] benefits based on a \nhousehold member’s sexual orientation or gender identity.”  Compl. ¶ 12 (emphasis added); see \nBr. 1.  And if that were the only practice touched by USDA’s rules, the States would drop this \nlawsuit.  But that is not what the Memoranda and Final Rule say.  Instead, those documents require \nthe States to espouse and adopt broader nondiscrimination policies that purportedly stretch beyond \nSNAP  certification  of  applicant  households,  and  even  beyond  SNAP  administration  more \ngenerally,  to  all  conduct  of  any  SNAP-administering  “institution.”  See  Nondiscrimination \nStatement.  That expansive sweep does, in fact, give rise to the injuries underlying this suit. \nTry as it might, USDA cannot sever those injuries from its own conduct.  Although the \nagency now claims the rules have no “independent legal significance,” Opp. 16, the record belies \nthat assertion, see, e.g., Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855 (“The protections included in this rule \nwill prevent discrimination . . . .” (emphasis added)).  The Final Rule and Memoranda command \nstate  actions  not  dictated  by  Congress.    Indeed,  USDA  conducted  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking—albeit improperly—precisely because its new Federal-State Agreement imposes \nspecific language not contained in the Food and Nutrition Act or prior Federal-State Agreements.  \nSee, e.g., Final Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 35,855 (claiming that “[c]odifying civil rights protections” \nthrough “update[d]” language “is vital to the success of SNAP”).  And despite what the agency \n3 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 11 of 36   PageID #: 579\n\nnow implies, see Opp. 17 (citing 7 C.F.R. § 272.2(b)(2)), that language is not negotiable: When \nNebraska submitted its updated Federal-State Agreement without the new “including gender \nidentity and sexual orientation” clause, USDA required Nebraska to resubmit its Federal-State \nAgreement with that objectionable clause.  Ex. A, Botelho Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.  Nebraska only did so \nunder protest and submitted a letter to that effect.  Ex. A, Botelho Decl. ¶¶ 7-10.  Other States, \nsuch as Montana and Tennessee, have also signed updated Federal-State Agreements with riders \nexplaining that they do not accept USDA’s unlawful attempt to impose the “gender identity and \nsexual orientation” language on them.  Ex. B, Hermanson Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C, Thaxton Decl. ¶ 4. \nThe fact that some States may assent to new language in their Federal-State Agreements is \nno impediment to this Court’s jurisdiction, either.  The States have acknowledged that, without a \npreliminary injunction, they may be forced to yield to USDA’s pressure and “change how they \noperate SNAP,” Br. 5 (citing Doc. 3-2, Crum Decl. ¶¶ 7-10), but that ongoing burden on state \nautonomy is itself a harm undergirding this lawsuit.  Indeed, the States’ standing does not turn on \nany “refus[al] to sign the new” Agreements or any commitment to disregard the Memoranda.  Opp. \n17.  On the contrary, the States can derive standing from the costs and burdens of complying with \nthe Final Rule and Memoranda as “regulated . . . entit[ies].”  State Nat’l Bank of Big Spring, 795 \nF.3d at 53; see Sch. Dist. of Pontiac, 584 F.3d at 262; cf. West Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2606 (“There \ncan be ‘little question’ that the rule[s] . . . injure the States.”).  Such costs and burdens were \nimminent “at the time [the States] filed [their] complaint,” Am. Clinical Lab’y Ass’n v. Becerra, \n40 F.4th 616, 622 (D.C. Cir. 2022), because they agency was already demanding that States update \ntheir  complaint-processing  procedures,  see  Memorandum  at  1-3,  publish  the  new \nNondiscrimination Statement, see Supplemental Memorandum at 1, and adopt USDA’s view of \nTitle IX discrimination on the “institution[al] level,” Nondiscrimination Statement.  The costs and \n4 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 12 of 36   PageID #: 580\n\nburdens associated with those directives will perpetuate the underlying controversy unless USDA \npermanently abandons its new rules and “eradicate[s] the[ir] effects,” Zukerman v. USPS, 961 F.3d \n431, 443 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  USDA’s failure to do so confirms the States’ standing to sue. \nB.  The States’ claims are ripe for judicial review. \nUSDA next suggests the States’ claims are not ripe for review.  See Opp. 18.  That, too, is \nwrong.  These claims ripened as soon as USDA published its Final Rule and Memoranda \ncontaining the mandates at issue.  See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. EPA, 290 F.3d 377, 380-81 (D.C. \nCir. 2002) (holding a challenge to an EPA “guidance document” ripe because the document \ncontained final, legislative rules).  To argue otherwise, USDA must reconceive this lawsuit as a \npreemptive collateral attack on some future administrative order “suspending, terminating, or \nrefus[ing]” SNAP funding to one or more of the States.  Opp. 18.  That is not accurate.  Contrary \nto USDA’s belief, this is a challenge to the new mandates themselves, not some “application of \nthe agency’s position to particular facts.”  Gen. Elec., 290 F.3d at 381.  “In this situation, nothing \nwould be gained from delaying review.”  Id.  Defendants’ ripeness argument fails. \nC.  The States lack an adequate alternative remedy. \nAs should be clear by now, Defendants’ attempt to channel this lawsuit through an \nadministrative adjudication necessarily fails as well.  Relying primarily on Thunder Basin Coal \nCo. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), Defendants argue that the States should raise their grievances \n“in defense of” some yet-uninitiated “enforcement action,” Opp. 19.  According to the agency, \n“Congress intended Title IX and the FNA to create exclusive avenues for challenging enforcement \nactions brough by the federal government under those laws,” Opp. 19-20, so the States cannot \ninvoke the APA’s more-general review provisions to challenge the Final Rule and Memoranda.  \nAgain, the agency’s obfuscation buckles under scrutiny. \n5 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 13 of 36   PageID #: 581\n\nThunder Basin is irrelevant.  In that case, a mine operator sought to short-circuit an \nadministrative adjudication by securing an injunction against the Secretary of Labor in federal \ndistrict court.  See 510 U.S. at 204-05.  The Supreme Court checked that maneuver, reasoning that \nthe Mine Act vested the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission with “exclusive \njurisdiction over challenges to agency enforcement proceedings” and subjected the Commission’s \ndecisions to review in “the [federal] courts of appeals.”  Id. at 208.  According to the Supreme \nCourt, “[n]othing in the language [or] structure of the [Mine] Act or its legislative history” could \nbe read “to allow mine operators to evade the statutory-review process by enjoining the Secretary \nfrom commencing enforcement proceedings.”  Id. at 216.  The lawsuit was thus premature. \nYet, unlike the plaintiff in Thunder Basin, the States in this case have brought a “broad-\nscale attack on the” USDA’s new “regulations,” Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Labor, 292 F.3d 849, \n856  (D.C.  Cir.  2002)  (emphasis  added),  not  an  anticipatory  challenge  to  “enforcement \nproceedings,”  Opp.  21.    Administrative  law  “typically  treat[s]  . . .  regulations”  that  follow \nrulemaking “differently from” orders that follow “adjudication[s].”  Nat’l Min. Ass’n, 292 F.3d at \n857 (citing United States v. Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co., 410 U.S. 224 (1973)); see also 5 U.S.C. § 551 \n(distinguishing “rule[s]” of general applicability from “order[s]” applied to a specific party).  And \nonly a dispute over the latter could fall within the relevant claim-channeling provisions, which \napply to any “final determination,” 7 U.S.C. § 2023(a)(13), finding that a State has “fail[ed] . . . \nwithout good cause to comply with” its SNAP-implementing obligations, id. § 2020(g); cf. \nMcNary  v.  Haitian  Refugee  Ctr.,  Inc.,  498  U.S.  479,  492  (1991)  (reading  the  phrase \n“determination” to refer only to an individual adjudication—not a determination made in a \nregulation). \n6 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 14 of 36   PageID #: 582\n\nNo such order has issued in this case, and Plaintiff States are not attempting to preempt \none.  Instead, “[i]n the case at bar,” USDA has promulgated regulations “prospective in operation \nand general in scope,” and the States have challenged “all of [those] regulations together as well \nas the entire rulemaking process.”  Nat’l Min. Ass’n, 292 F.3d at 858 (quoting Trans-Pac. Freight \nConf. of Japan/Korea v. Fed. Maritime Comm’n, 650 F.2d 1235, 1244-45 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).  Under \nthese circumstances, the States’ claims are wholly collateral to statutory review processes set out \nin Title IX and the FNA, and that finding clearly supports the conclusion that Congress did not \nintend to relegate these types of claims to the USDA.  See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 490 (2010); cf. Jafarzadeh v. Duke, 270 F. Supp. 3d 296, 308 (D.D.C. \n2017) (permitting review of “the allegedly unlawful processes and practices” an agency applied to \nall adjudications); Elk Run Coal Co. v. Dep’t of Lab., 804 F. Supp. 2d 8, 19 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(permitting review of “broad facial and systemic challenges” to agency action).  Federal district \ncourts have repeatedly exercised jurisdiction over this type of claim.  See, e.g., Dist. of Columbia \nv. USDA, 496 F. Supp. 3d 213 (D.D.C. 2020); Gilliam v. USDA, 486 F. Supp. 3d 856 (E.D. Pa. \n2020); Hall v. USDA, 467 F. Supp. 3d 838 (N.D. Cal. 2020).  This Court should do the same.  \nMoreover, even if this case were construed as a “pre-enforcement” challenge to some \nadministrative punishment, it would not matter.  “[A] long line of precedent allow[s]” such \nchallenges, and rightfully so.  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *9.  Indeed, “[a]s the Supreme \nCourt recognized in both [Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120 (2012)] and [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nv. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590 (2016)], helplessly awaiting the initiation of enforcement proceedings \n. . . and risking potential liability in the interim is not an adequate remedy under the APA.”  \nTennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *18.  The Court has jurisdiction to decide the merits of this case. \n7 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 15 of 36   PageID #: 583\n\nII.  USDA Failed to Follow Proper Rulemaking Procedures. \nUpon reaching the merits, the Court should curb USDA’s flouting of the APA’s mandatory \nrulemaking  procedures.    The  Final  Rule  announced  non-discrimination  requirements \nconspicuously missing from the agency’s rulemaking proposal, and the Memoranda imposed \nlegislative rules without providing any notice at all.  Those defects alone require this Court to set \naside USDA’s rules.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nFinal Rule.  USDA enacted its Final Rule without providing fair notice or the opportunity \nfor public comment.  See Br. 9-10; 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3).  The agency does not deny that its \nrulemaking  proposal  “lack[ed]  of  any  mention”  of  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation.  \nChesapeake Climate Action Network v. EPA, 952 F.3d 310, 320 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  Nor does it \ndispute that those requirements “eliminate, rather than retain, the status quo” by imposing new \nobligations on the States.  Dist. of Columbia v. USDA, 496 F. Supp. 3d at 231 (cleaned up).  Instead, \nit briskly maintains that the Final Rule’s expansion was “entirely foreseeable” because (1) the \nproposal referenced discrimination “on the grounds of sex,” and (2) parties in pending litigation \nhad argued that such language extends beyond biological sex.  Opp. 26-27.  That is no defense. \nTo begin with, Defendants offer no authority for their novel conception of notice.  That \nshould come as no surprise.  Adopting USDA’s approach would require the public to scour federal \ndockets to divine an agency’s thinking, all but eliminating the agency’s obligation to provide “fair \nnotice” itself.  Leyse v. Clear Channel Broad., 545 F. App’x 444, 454 (6th Cir. 2013).   \nThis case amply illustrates what would result from that arrangement.  USDA’s initial \nproposal elicited only five comments, not one of which addressed sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  See Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Civil Rights Update to the Federal-\n8 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 16 of 36   PageID #: 584\n\nState Agreement, Regulations.gov (Nov. 16, 2016).1  By contrast, a recent notice that expressly \nproposed expanding Title IX to discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation \nreceived  over  240,000  comments—many  of  which  directly  address  those  issues.    See \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, Regulations.gov (Sept. 14, 2022).2  This disparity shows that USDA “failed \nto give the public any inkling” that these groups would be included in the Final Rule.  See Dist. of \nColumbia v. USDA, 496 F. Supp. 3d at 231.     \nOn this record, USDA cannot credibly deny its attempt to sneak in new anti-discrimination \nrequirements through a long-dormant rulemaking proposal—removing the public from the process \nentirely.  This Court should not allow that blatant disregard of mandatory administrative procedure.   \nMemoranda.  With respect to the Memoranda, USDA failed to even attempt a public \ncomment process.  The agency claims it did not have to comport with the APA’s notice-and-\ncomment requirements because the Memoranda qualify as “interpretive document[s] that do[] not \nconstitute final agency action.”  Opp. 22; see Opp. 22-24. That argument mixes the final-agency-\naction inquiry with the interpretive-or-legislative-rule determination.  Regardless, the Memoranda \nsatisfy both inquiries by imposing binding obligations on regulated parties.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 \nU.S. 154, 178 (1997) (agency action is final if it imposes “obligations”); Tenn. Hosp. Ass’n v. \nAzar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 (6th Cir. 2018) (rule is legislative if “create[s] new . . . duties”).  Indeed, \n“[l]egislative . . . rules are, by definition, final agency action.”  Doe v. U.S. Customs & Border \nProtection, No. 20-672, 2021 WL 980888, at *9 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 16, 2021) (quoting Broadgate \n \n1 https://www.regulations.gov/document/FNS-2016-0078-0001/comment. \n2 https://www.regulations.gov/document/ED-2021-OCR-0166-0001. \n9 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 17 of 36   PageID #: 585\n\nInc. v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., 730 F. Supp. 2d 240, 243 (D.D.C. 2010)), and the \nMemoranda contain legislative rules.   \nContrary to USDA’s contentions, the Memoranda do far more than “simply state[] what \nthe administrative agency thinks the statute means.”  Opp. 22 (quoting Azar, 908 F.3d at 1042).  \nIn addition to creating “new law,” Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21, the Memoranda impose \nconcrete obligations and other “changes” that “impact [State] operations.”  Cover Letter at 1.  For \nexample, State agencies “must” publish USDA’s new Nondiscrimination Statement on their \nwebsites “within 90 days” and must update “[d]ocuments, pamphlets, brochures, etc., . . . when \ncurrent supply on hand is exhausted or by September 30, 2023.”  Supplemental Memorandum at \n1.  The Memoranda also list “steps [that] must be taken by State Agencies and program operators” \nto effectuate USDA’s new policies:  they must “update their . . . complaint processing procedures,” \nMemorandum Q&A at 2, and ensure that “[a]ll new printing” contains the new Nondiscrimination \nStatement, Supplemental Memorandum at 1.  In short, these obligations constitute far more than a \nnon-binding interpretation that States are “free to ignore.”  Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d \n243, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  The Memoranda “read[] like a ukase”: they “command[],” they \n“require[],” they “order[],” and they “dictate[].”  Id. (quoting Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 \nF.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).  In fact, Defendants themselves suggest that USDA “could \n. . . bring an enforcement action” for violation of these new obligations, which soundly confirms \nthe legislative nature of the rules.  Opp. 24; see Appalachian Power, 208 F.3d at 1021 (stating that \na rule qualifies as legislative if an agency can “base[] enforcement actions on the policies or \ninterpretations formulated in the document”) \nLastly, the fact that the rules may “flow from” a statutory regime does not make them \ninterpretive.  Opp. 25.  USDA must ground all its actions in some grant of “statutory . . . authority,” \n10 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 18 of 36   PageID #: 586\n\n5 U.S.C. § 706, so in that sense, all its rules do “flow from” a statute, Opp. 25.  But in this case, \nUSDA was not “merely inform[ing] the public of [its] interpretation” of a statute when it required \nStates’ websites to contain a new Nondiscrimination Statement within 90 days.  Id. at 24.  Rather, \nit was “giv[ing] the States their ‘marching orders’ and . . . expect[ing] the[m] to fall in line.”  \nAppalachian Power, 208 F.3d at 1023.  Such “mandatory language” imposed concrete obligations \nsubject to judicial review.  Env’t Integrity Project v. EPA, 425 F.3d 992, 998 (D.C. Cir. 2005).   \nBecause USDA “attempt[ed] to issue . . . legislative rule[s] without abiding by the APA’s \nprocedural requirements,” the States will likely succeed on the merits of their procedural challenge.  \nAzar, 908 F.3d at 1042. \nIII.  USDA’s Actions were Arbitrary and Capricious. \nEven if the Final Rule and Memoranda had sprung from appropriate procedures, they \nwould still be “arbitrary” and “capricious.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see Br. 12.  For one, as a matter \nof law, an agency decision made “without adequate notice and comment is arbitrary or an abuse \nof discretion”—a point USDA does not dispute.  See Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 279 F.3d \n1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2002).  Moreover, USDA effectively admits that it failed to consider the \nreliance interests associated with banning sex-separated facilities, claiming only that the Final Rule \nand Memoranda do not “mention” that issue.  Opp. 30.  Whether mentioned directly or not, the \nnew  rules  do  implicate  facilities  and  other  sex-based  policies  by  banning  gender  identity \ndiscrimination on the “institution[al]” level.  Nondiscrimination Statement.  USDA was thus \nrequired to consider reliance interests independently, rather than relying on the Department of \nEducation’s equally vacuous analysis.  Indeed, the fact that a rule arguably comports with \nprecedent, which these do not, does not immunize an agency from having to consider reliance \ninterests.  See Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915 (2020).  \n11 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 19 of 36   PageID #: 587\n\nUSDA’s failure to “‘reasonably consider[]” that “relevant issue[]” renders its rules arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Advocs. for Highway & Auto Safety v. FMCSA, 41 F.4th 586, 595 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021)). \nIV.  USDA’s Rules are Contrary to Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act. \nEven if USDA’s rules had been well-reasoned and properly promulgated, the States would \nstill succeed on the merits because the rules violate governing law. \nA.  The Final Rule and Memoranda are Contrary to Title IX. \nThis Court has already ruled that “nowhere in Bostock, Title IX, or its implementing \nregulations” is there an obligation for Title IX “regulated entities not to discriminate based on \nsexual orientation or gender identity.”  Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21.  Defendants have \nno  way  to  distinguish  that  ruling  or  the  Sixth  Circuit’s  post-Bostock  precedent.    Instead, \nDefendants  repeat  the  same  Title  IX  arguments  that  were  unsuccessful  in  Tennessee  and \nencourages this Court to follow out-of-circuit decisions rather than the text of Title IX. \nDefendants’ assertion that there is an “absence of any substantial linguistic or structural \ndistinction between the non-discrimination mandates in Title VII [and] Title IX,” Opp. 28, requires \nthem to ignore the text of Title IX.  Most notably, despite claiming the States “have conjured up a \nfear of their own imagining” about the Final Rule and Memoranda prohibiting sex-separated \nbathrooms, Opp. 30, they rely on a divided Fourth Circuit opinion holding that schools violate \nTitle IX if they do not allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of the opposite biological \nsex, id. at 29 (citing Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 618 (4th Cir. 2020), as \namended (Aug. 28, 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. 2878 (with Justices Thomas and Alito noting that \nthey would have granted the petition for writ of certiorari)).   \n12 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 20 of 36   PageID #: 588\n\nThat approach to Title IX essentially erases 20 U.S.C. § 1686 from the statute.  In enacting \nTitle IX, Congress specified that “nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any \neducational institution receiving funds under this Act[] from maintaining separate living facilities \nfor the different sexes.”  20 U.S.C. § 1686; see Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21 (ruling that \n“Title IX does allow for sex-separation in” such circumstances).  The Sixth Circuit identified this \nvery statutory provision in Meriwether v. Hartop as one of several “important . . . differ[ences]” \nbetween Title IX and Title VII.  992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021).  USDA’s construction of \nTitle IX, in contrast, apparently prohibits institutions from maintaining separate bathrooms, locker \nrooms, and shower facilities for the different sexes when an individual’s gender identity does not \nalign with (biological) sex.  Institutions cannot have truly separate living facilities for the different \nsexes if they must make exceptions for every transgender individual. \nThe Final Rule and Memoranda are, at their foundation, an attempt to convert Title IX’s \nprohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), into a prohibition of all \nforms of sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination.  If Congress had wanted the latter \nprohibition, it would not have used the word “sex.”  That word has a binary biological definition—\na point Defendants do not dispute, Opp. 29—and it does not mean sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  Instead, Defendants argue that Congress’s choice of words in Title IX “is irrelevant,” \nOpp. 29, because of Bostock v. Clayton County’s ruling that firing “someone simply for being \nhomosexual or transgender” is discrimination “because of such individual’s sex” under Title VII, \n140 S. Ct. 1731, 1753 (2020).  That this one type of sexual orientation or gender identity \ndiscrimination is also discrimination because of sex under Title VII does not mean that either Title \nVII or Title IX prohibits all forms of sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination.  See \nTennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21-22.  For example, while “[a]n individual’s homosexuality \n13 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 21 of 36   PageID #: 589\n\nor transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions” about hiring and firing, Bostock, \n140 S. Ct. at 1741 (emphasis added), sex is relevant to decisions about locker rooms, showers, and \nother contexts where biological differences between the two sexes matter. \nEven if this Court were to retreat from its recent interpretation in Tennessee of Title VII \ndiscrimination “because of . . . sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), Title IX uses distinct “on the basis \nof sex” language that makes clear biological sex must be the sole reason for the discrimination, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a).  See Br. 16-17.  Defendants ignore that textual distinction except to say that \nBostock seemed to “use[] the terms interchangeably.”  Opp. 27.  But Defendants also ignore \nPlaintiff States’ reminder that “‘the language of an opinion is not always to be parsed as though’ \nit were ‘the language of a statute.’”  Br. 17 (quoting Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 341 \n(1979)).  The dispositive question is what Congress intended, and Congress chose to use different \nlanguage in the two statutes.   \nBefore Bostock expanded the understanding of Title VII to include firing employees simply \nfor being homosexual or transgender, it made more sense generally to “look[] to Title VII . . . as \nan analog for the legal standards in both Title IX discrimination and retaliation claims.”  Opp. 28 \n(quoting Nelson v. Christian Bros. Univ., 226 F. App’x 448, 454 (6th Cir. 2007)).  Nevertheless, \nthe Sixth Circuit has repeatedly said after Bostock that “that principles announced in the Title VII \ncontext” do not “automatically apply in the Title IX context.”  Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 510 n.4.  \nObeying the Supreme Court’s instruction not to extend its reasoning beyond the particular Title \nVII issue in Bostock, the Sixth Circuit has held that “the rule in Bostock extends no further than \nTitle VII and does not stretch to the” Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”).  Pelcha \nv. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021).  That the ADEA uses similar “because \nof” language and protects individuals from discrimination made no difference in the Sixth Circuit’s \n14 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 22 of 36   PageID #: 590\n\nanalysis.  Id.  Nor should the reasoning of Bostock extend to Title IX, which does not even use the \n“because of” language of Title VII. \nBecause USDA’s rewriting of Title IX conflicts with how this Court and the Sixth Circuit \nhave approached Title IX after Bostock, the agency points the Court to Grimm and district court \nopinions from outside the Sixth Circuit.  See Opp. 27-28.  Those scattered opinions are no reason \nto sideline Tennessee, Meriwether, and Pelcha.  Most of the district court cases Defendants rely \nupon, see Opp. 28, involved the Affordable Care Act and conflict with the Fifth Circuit’s recent \naffirmance of a permanent injunction against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nsee Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Becerra, No. 21-11174, 2022 WL 3700044, at *2 & n.11, *8 (5th \nCir. Aug. 26, 2022) (affirming the permanent injunction in part because the Eastern District of \nNew York and the District of D.C. had attempted to undo the vacatur of a gender-identity rule).  \nAll that Defendants have left from other district courts is a footnote from Doe v. University of \nScranton, No. 3:19-CV-01486, 2020 WL 5993766, at *5 n.61 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 9, 2020).  That \nfootnote is inconsistent with precedent from this Court and the Sixth Circuit, and that district court \nstill ultimately granted the motion to dismiss the Title IX claims because the university did not \ncontrol the off-campus housing where the incidents in that case occurred. Id. at *9.   \nB.  The Final Rule and Memoranda are Contrary to the Food and Nutrition Act. \nDefendants next assert that the portions of the Final Rule and Memoranda implementing \nthe Food and Nutrition Act do not “bear on issues related to ‘maintaining sex separated bathrooms \nand locker rooms, offering sex-separated athletic teams, or using biologically accurate pronouns.’”  \nOpp. 30 (quoting Br. 19).  To be sure, that statute only prohibits discrimination “by reason of . . . \nsex” “[i]n the certification of applicant households for” SNAP benefits.  7 U.S.C. § 2020(c)(1); \nsee also id. § 2020(c)(2) (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age, disability, and race in \n15 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 23 of 36   PageID #: 591\n\nSNAP “administration”).  And the States have not tried to “impose any other standards of \neligibility as a condition for participating in the program.”  Id. § 2014(b).   \nBut to the extent the agency is relying on the Food and Nutrition Act to prohibit gender \nidentity and sexual orientation discrimination throughout all SNAP-administering “institution[s],” \nNondiscrimination Statement, it is undisputedly violating the law.  Moreover, USDA offers no \nreasoning for why “sex” in the Food and Nutrition Act would not refer to the same biological \nbinary as it does in Title IX and not refer to sexual orientation or gender identity.  Br. 15-16.  Of \ncourse Tennessee, Meriwether, and Pelcha did not specifically address the Food and Nutrition Act.  \nBut the Sixth Circuit’s holding that “the rule in Bostock extends no further than Title VII” is just \nas applicable.  Pelcha, 988 F.3d at 324. \nV.  The Final Rule and Memoranda Violate the U.S. Constitution. \nUSDA’s new assertions of authority are also contrary to law because they violate the U.S. \nConstitution  in  myriad  ways.    Despite  Defendants’  repeated  attempts  to  wave  away  these \nconstitutional defects by invoking Bostock, Opp. 31-34, “the rule in Bostock extends no further \nthan Title VII” and does not “stretch to” Title IX or the Food and Nutrition Act, Pelcha, 988 F.3d \nat 324; see Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1737; Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *21.  The only \nconstitutional provision that the Supreme Court even referenced was the First Amendment, but \n“how these doctrines protecting religious liberty interact with Title VII are questions for future \ncases too.”  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1754.  There is no justification for pretending that Bostock has \nalready “confirmed” that USDA’s rewriting of Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act presents \nno constitutional problem.  Opp. 31. \nSpending Clause.  USDA’s rules violate the Spending Clause for at least two reasons.  \nFirst, Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act—at the time of their enactment and initial acceptance \n16 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 24 of 36   PageID #: 592\n\nby Plaintiff States—did not “unambiguously” prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and \nsexual orientation.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  The Sixth \nCircuit’s divided, pre-Bostock motions panel decision in Dodds v. U.S. Department of Education \nsaid nothing about the meaning of Title IX.  845 F.3d 217 (6th Cir. 2016) (per curiam).  Dodds did \nnot definitively address whether the school district had violated Title IX; it only declined to stay \nan injunction.  Id. at 221-22.  And, as now-Chief Judge Sutton pointed out in his dissent, the \nSupreme Court reached exactly the opposite conclusion when it granted a similar stay request.  Id. \nat 222 (Sutton, J., dissenting). \nSecond, the Final Rule and Memoranda leverage billions of dollars in SNAP and SNAP-\nEd funding to coerce States into adopting USDA’s newly preferred policies.  Defendants do not \ndeny that the Final Rule and Memoranda are designed to coerce States, Opp. 32-33, nor could they.  \nUSDA’s new rules have already put “a gun to the head” of each State, Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. \nv. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 581 (2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.), and succeeded in getting States \nsuch as Alaska to comply, Br. 20 (citing Crum Decl., ¶¶ 8-10).  And yet, the agency maintains that \nthe rules are not “improperly” or “unlawful[ly]” coercive.  Opp. 32-33 (emphases added). \nTo justify that claim, Defendants try two maneuvers.  They start by citing two cases where \ncourts rejected Spending Clause arguments.  Opp. 32.  In Gruver v. Louisiana Board of Supervisors \nfor LSU Agricultural & Mechanical College, the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed a twenty-year-old \ndecision holding that Louisiana waived “immunity against suits alleging sex discrimination,” not \nsexual orientation or gender identity discrimination, by accepting Title IX funding.  959 F.3d 178, \n180 (5th Cir. 2020) (citing Pederson v. LSU, 213 F.3d 858, 876 (5th Cir. 2000)).  There was no \nnew funding condition.  And Tennessee v. U.S. Department of State involved a situation where the \ndistrict  court  ruled  the  State  already  had  an  independent  obligation  due  to  constitutional \n17 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 25 of 36   PageID #: 593\n\nrequirements and a preexisting statute based on Congress’s enumerated powers.  329 F. Supp. 3d \n597, 623-25 (W.D. Tenn. 2018), aff’d on alternative grounds sub nom. State by & through Tenn. \nGen. Assembly v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 931 F.3d 499 (6th Cir. 2019).  Defendants do not make those \nsame arguments here. \nInstead, without any case to turn to, Defendants retreat to the proposition that USDA’s \nrules cannot be unconstitutionally coercive because “simply applying the existing provisions of \nTitle IX and the FNA to [USDA’s] longstanding nutrition programs . . . based on an interpretation \nof those statutes that has been recognized as valid under analogous circumstances in Bostock” is \nnot really a new funding condition.  Opp. 32-33.  That roundabout explanation for why the \nMemoranda and Final Rule supposedly do nothing mistakenly conflates the Spending Clause’s \nprohibition of federal coercion with its unambiguous-statement-of-conditions rule.  Even if a \nstatute’s funding conditions are obvious from the get-go, they can still be coercive.  See Kentucky \nv. Yellen, 563 F. Supp. 3d 647, 658 (E.D. Ky. 2021) (ruling the American Rescue Plan Act \nunconstitutionally coercive regardless of whether the funding provisions were unambiguous), \nappeal pending, No. 21-6108 (6th Cir.).  And if Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act really \nmeant what Defendants now say the laws mean, then those statutes would no doubt be coercive \nunder the Spending Clause. \nFirst Amendment.  Defendants insist that “neither the Final Rule nor the May 5 Memo \nsays anything” about the use of biologically accurate pronouns.  Opp. 34.  But requiring the States \nto prohibit gender identity discrimination at least arguably does so.  The EEOC already tried to \nforce that understanding of Title VII on the States until this Court enjoined the purported guidance.  \nTennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *3, *24.  The Sixth Circuit held in Meriwether that an Ohio \nuniversity attempting to enforce a supposed prohibition in Title IX against gender identity \n18 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 26 of 36   PageID #: 594\n\ndiscrimination  “violated  [a  professor’s]  free-speech  rights”  by  punishing  the  professor  for \ndeclining to use a student’s “preferred pronouns.” 992 F.3d at 512.  And the exemption for \n“educational institutions that are controlled by religious organizations,” Opp. 35, will provide no \nprotection for state employees or public-school students.   \nEven worse, Defendants completely ignore Plaintiff States’ concern that “Congress’s \nspending power ‘may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves \nbe unconstitutional.’”  Br. 21 (quoting South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210 (1987)).  By \nrequiring the States to engage in conduct that would violate the First Amendment rights of their \nstudents and employees, the Final Rule and Memoranda impose unconstitutional conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds.  USDA cannot “require that teaching and learning must be tailored to the \nprinciples or prohibitions of” a “dogma.”  Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 106 (1968).  But \nforcing States and their employees to propagate the USDA’s views about sex and gender does just \nthat.  The States “seek to assert their own ‘sovereign’ and ‘quasi-sovereign’ interests against the \nfederal government,” and their First Amendment claim is part of that effort.  Kentucky v. Biden, \n23 F.4th 585, 597-99 (6th Cir. 2022). \nThe First Amendment protects States from USDA turning them into federal mouthpieces.  \nThe First Amendment begins by declaring that “Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \nspeech.”  U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added).  That language is object-neutral; the First \nAmendment protects all from the federal government abridging their freedom of speech.  Although \nthe Supreme Court eventually incorporated the First Amendment into the Fourteenth Amendment \nto protect citizens against States, see Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925), the States have \nFirst Amendment rights “just as” private citizens do, Walker v. Tex. Div., Sons of Confederate \n19 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 27 of 36   PageID #: 595\n\nVeterans, Inc., 576 U.S. 200, 219-20 (2015).  At a minimum, a state “government, just like a \nprivate employer, retains” the right to control its own speech.  Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ., 624 \nF.3d 332, 342 (6th Cir. 2010) (citing Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 418 (2006)).  State \nemployees cannot “speak on the” state “government’s behalf and convey its intended messages” \nif the federal government has the untrammeled authority to dictate state employees’ every \npronouncement.  Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 142 S. Ct. 2407, 2423 (2022).  \nTenth Amendment and Anticommandeering Doctrine.  Defendants have little to say \nabout how USDA has violated the Tenth Amendment and Anticommandeering Doctrine.  Opp. \n33.  They gesture at New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992).  But that case held that “the \nConstitution does not confer upon Congress the ability simply to compel the States” to “provide \nfor the disposal of the radioactive waste generated within their borders” even though the State of \nNew York, which brought the suit, had previously “complied with the Act’s requirements.”  Id. at \n149, 154, 188.  State consent cannot justify federal commandeering. \nSeparation of Powers and Non-Delegation Doctrine.  If the Final Rule and Memoranda \npronounced  an  across-the-board  prohibition  of  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation \ndiscrimination under Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act, then USDA lacked the authority to \nresolve such a major question of “great political significance,” that “regulates a significant portion \nof the American economy,” impacts “billions of dollars” of funding, and intrudes into an area that \nis “traditionally regulated by the States.”  West Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2621 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring) (cleaned up).   \nBostock is no justification for what USDA has done.  Defendants cannot identify any \nintelligible principle in the text of Title IX or the Food and  Nutrition Act justifying their \nredefinition of “sex” to include “gender identity and sexual orientation.”  Defendants thus rewrite \n20 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 28 of 36   PageID #: 596\n\nBostock to include USDA’s preferred language in brackets because that phrasing appears nowhere \nin the opinion.  See Opp. 34 (turning “that employers are prohibited from firing employees on the \nbasis of homosexuality or transgender status,” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753, into “on the basis of \nsex [sex, including. . . sexual orientation] or transgender status” (alterations in Opp.)). \nVI.  The Equities Favor a Preliminary Injunction. \nA.  The States are already suffering irreparable harm. \nContrary to Defendants’ characterization, the States are not facing the mere possibility of \nirreparable harms in the future; they are suffering actual irreparable harm today.  The States are \ncurrently being subjected to regulations that conflict with their legal codes, burden their autonomy, \nand impose compliance costs that they can never recoup.  See, e.g., Br. 24.  Such impositions on \nState sovereignty “inflict[] irreparable harm,” Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2324 n.17 (2018), \nand the associated compliance costs routinely justify preliminary relief in challenges to federal \nagency action, Dist. of Columbia v. USDA, 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 34 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing California \nv. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018); Chamber of Com. v. Edmondson, 594 F.3d 742, 770-\n71 (10th Cir. 2010); and Iowa Utilities Bd. v. FCC, 109 F.3d 418, 426 (8th Cir. 1996)). \nB.  The public interest favors an injunction. \nWhen the injunction would run against the federal government, the potential harm to the \nopposing party and the public interest factors merge.   Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), \nand typically turn on a lawsuit’s merit.  Indeed, when a “plaintiff shows a substantial likelihood” \nthat government action will be deemed unlawful, “no substantial harm to others can be said to \ninhere in its enjoinment.”  Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov’t, 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. \n2001). If Plaintiff States are correct that the Final Rule and Memoranda are unlawful, then USDA’s \n21 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 29 of 36   PageID #: 597\n\nenforcement of those rules would undermine, rather than further, the purposes of Title IX, the Food \nand Nutrition Act, and the APA.   \nPlaintiff States, to be sure, do not deny certification of SNAP benefits based on a household \nmember’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  But Plaintiff States have various laws and policies \nthat at least arguably conflict with what the Memoranda and Final Rule seek to accomplish because \nUSDA did not cabin its gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination rules to SNAP \ncertification decision-making.  See Br. 24-25; see also Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *7 & \nnn.8-9 (identifying laws of ten Plaintiff States as arguably conflicting with the Department of \nEducation’s similar attempt to redefine Title IX discrimination on the basis of sex).  As in \nTennessee, which involved the very Department of Education Interpretation that USDA adopted \nin its Memoranda, an arguable conflict exists, and that suffices. \nThe challenged rules also impose harms on Plaintiff States’ citizens.  Plaintiff States’ \narguably conflicting laws and policies protect student and employee safety and privacy, safeguard \nfair competition in sports, and defend religious liberties and freedom of speech.  There is no harm \nin preserving the status quo for SNAP that existed for nearly two years after Bostock. \nC.  Injunctive relief should apply to all Plaintiff States. \nThe APA instructs this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \nprocedurally or substantively deficient.  5 U.S.C. § 706.  Courts have long held this to mean that \ninvalid “rules are vacated,” not merely inapplicable to particular parties.  Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quotation marks omitted).  \nWhile this case is pending, this Court should exercise an already limited version of that vacatur \npower to protect all Plaintiff States (and entities within their jurisdiction) from implementation of \n22 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 30 of 36   PageID #: 598\n\nthe Final Rule and Memoranda.  Otherwise, this Court is failing to provide them complete \npreliminary relief.  See Tennessee, 2022 WL 2791450, at *24 & n.18 (granting such relief). \nAs two federal agencies unsuccessfully requested in Tennessee, USDA wants the Court to \ndeny relief to Plaintiff States “in the Fourth and Seventh Circuit where the courts of appeals have \nalready concluded that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.”  Opp. 38.  But this Court is not bound by decisions of other circuits.  Instead, the Court \nmust apply federal law according to its own binding precedent and reasoning, United States v. \nGlaser, 14 F.3d 1213, 1216 (7th Cir. 1994), and must bring that application to bear on all parties \nproperly before it, Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 289 (1952).  Indeed, the only case \nDefendants cite for their remarkable request is a divided Ninth Circuit opinion where the federal \ngovernment itself sought a nationwide injunction.  United States v. AMC Ent., Inc., 549 F.3d 760 \n(9th Cir. 2008).  Thus, those Fourth and Seventh Circuit decisions do not prevent this Court from \nawarding relief to parties that are properly before it. \nMoreover, even if this Court deferred to the Fourth and Seventh Circuits in the interest of \ncomity, it could not erase the procedural defects in the rules, or the constitutional issues those \ncourts have not addressed.  Thus, even if USDA were right about Title IX, the rules are still \nunlawful, and the States are still entitled to injunctive relief. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiff States respectfully request that this Court preliminarily enjoin Defendants from \nimplementing USDA’s Final Rule and Memoranda against the Plaintiff States (and entities within \nthose States’ jurisdiction) while this action remains pending. \n   \n23 \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00257-TRM-DCP   Document 59   Filed 09/23/22   Page 31 of 36   PageID #: 599\n\nDated: September 23, 2022  Respectfully Submitted, \n/s/ Clark L.
