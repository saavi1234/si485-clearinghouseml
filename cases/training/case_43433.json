    "summary": "<p>In this case, twenty states challenged the Biden Administration Education Department&rsquo;s and EEOC&rsquo;s rules prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Background: </strong></p>\r\n<p>On June 15, 2020, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em>, 590 U.S. 644, (2020), that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which governs employment discrimination,&nbsp; prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.&nbsp; Title IX of the Education Amendments Act governs education, and contains similar language to Title VII; how <em>Bostock </em>applies to it is contested.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 22, 2021, in response to <em>Bostock</em>, the United States Department of Education (DoEd) issued an &ldquo;Interpretation&rdquo; of Title IX in the Federal Register, announcing its determination that Title IX did prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Therefore, according to DoEd, schools receiving federal funding were prohibited from such discrimination. On June 23, 2023, DoEd published a &ldquo;Dear Educator&rdquo; letter asserting that DoEd would &ldquo;fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.&rdquo; A Fact Sheet accompanied the &ldquo;Dear Educator&rdquo; letter.</p>\r\n<p>On June 15, 2021, the United States Department of Labor&rsquo;s EEOC issued a technical assistance document regarding Title VII. The EEOC Document prohibited state employers, regardless of customer preferences, from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Case Summary:</strong></p>\r\n<p>On August 30, 2021, twenty states, by their (Republican) attorneys general, brought this lawsuit against the DoEd and the EEOC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, challenging those agencies&rsquo; directives extending federal sex discrimination protections to transgender people in schools and government employment. The plaintiff states alleged that DoEd and EEOC misinterpreted <em>Bostock</em>&rsquo;s holding, failed to follow required procedures, exceeded their statutory authority, and violated the separation of powers doctrine, First Amendment, Tenth Amendment, Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the United States Constitution's Spending Clause.</p>\r\n<p>On September 2, 2021 (three days after filing suit), the plaintiff states moved for a preliminary injunction against DoEd and EEOC, seeking to enjoin DoEd from enforcing its Interpretation, &ldquo;Dear Educator&rdquo; letter, and Fact Sheet. (In other words, the states sought to enjoin DoEd from enforcing Title IX against schools discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity.) The plaintiff states also sought to enjoin EEOC from enforcing the EEOC document. On September 23, 2021, DoEd and EEOC filed a combined response and a motion to dismiss, alleging that the states both lacked standing and failed to state a plausible claim for relief.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on October 4, 2021, the Association of Christian Schools International (ASCI) and associated minors filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit. ASCI is a non-profit corporation consisting of private Christian schools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 15, 2022, the court granted a preliminary injunction against DoEd and EEOC, barring the agencies from implementing the Interpretation, Dear Educator, Fact Sheet, and technical assistance document against the plaintiff states. The court also denied DoEd's and EEOC&rsquo;s motion to dismiss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 13, 2022, DoEd and EEOC appealed the court&rsquo;s decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>In district court, on September 14, 2022, the court ruled that ASCI lacked standing for its standalone causes of action against DoEd, but permitted ASCI to intervene in the complaint strictly as to its claims and requests for relief that overlapped with the state plaintiffs. ASCI filed its intervening complaint in the case on September 19, 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Similar litigation was simultaneously going on in other districts; the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas vacated the EEOC technical assistance document and issued a declaratory judgment that it was unlawful, on Oct. 1, 2022 in <a href=\"../../../../case/45696/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Texas v. EEOC</a>. Subsequently, the EEOC no longer defended its technical assistance document in this lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 3, 2022, the court stayed further proceedings in the case while DoEd&rsquo;s interlocutory appeal was pending.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion regarding DoEd's appeal on June 14, 2024. In a 2-1 decision, the Sixth Circuit ruled that (1) the plaintiff states had standing to file suit, (2) the states&rsquo; claims against DoEd were reviewable by courts under the APA, and (3) the district court&rsquo;s preliminary injunction was appropriate because the states appeared &ldquo;likely to succeed in their claim that the [DoEd documents] amount to a legislative rule and therefore should be set aside.&rdquo; On July 10, 2024, the district court lifted the stay it had entered on November 3, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on March 10, 2023, Arizona, one of the 20 state plaintiffs, had filed a motion seeking to remove itself as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Three days later, the other 19 plaintiff states filed a motion in opposition. On July 19, 2024, the district court denied Arizona&rsquo;s motion. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to dismiss a party while (a) an appeal was pending and (b) dismissing the party would \"substantively\" narrow the underlying preliminary injunction subject to the appeal. Because because the Sixth Circuit had not yet issued a mandate and because the court held that dismissing Arizona would substantively narrow the scope of the underlying preliminary injunction, the court denied Arizona's motion.&nbsp; Arizona to withdraw from the lawsuit would force the court to modify its preliminary injunction.&nbsp; However, once the Sixth Circuit mandate issued (on August 7, 2024), Arizona renewed its motion to remove itself as a plaintiff, and the district court dismissed Arizona as a party to the case.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2024, the district court administratively closed this case--that is, it maintained the case on the docket, but paused actual litigation. The court reasoned that some of the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were moot and for others, a practically identical challenge would soon be before the Fifth Circuit. &nbsp;In its decision, the district court noted: (1) the EEOC&rsquo;s technical assistance document had been vacated (as described above) so that claims relating to that document were moot. (2) On June 11, 2024, another district judge in the N.D. of Texas issued a final judgment declaring unlawful the same Title IV documents at issue in this case, see T<a href=\"../../../../case/45669/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exas v. Cardona</a>, 2024 WL 3658767 (N.D. Texas Aug. 5, 2024), and that DoEd had not yet decided whether it would appeal. (3) DoEd had amended the regulations, with the final regulations becoming effective on August 1, 2024, and several lawsuits had been filed to prevent the final rule from taking effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case remains administratively closed and the injunction remains ongoing.</p>",

After the Supreme Court’s 2020 Bostock decision, the \nU.S. Department of Education issued three documents under Title IX—each stating that the \nDepartment will now fully enforce Title IX to prohibit sexual orientation and gender identity \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 7 of 59   PageID #: 2633\n \n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 3 (8 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 3 \n \ndiscrimination in education programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.1  The \nDepartment’s actions prompted twenty states to bring a pre-enforcement challenge.  A district \ncourt granted the States a preliminary injunction.  On interlocutory appeal, the Department \nchallenges this ruling, arguing that the States lack standing, the Documents are unreviewable, \nand the district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction.  We disagree and affirm. \nI. \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in education \nprograms or activities receiving federal financial assistance.  A watershed enactment, Title IX \ncontains two core provisions.  The first prohibits discrimination: “No person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  The second relates to enforcement, authorizing agencies that \naward federal financial assistance to education programs to “issu[e] rules, regulations, or orders \nof general applicability,” ensuring that aid recipients adhere to § 1681’s mandate.  Id. § 1682.  \nOne such agency is the Department of Education. \nIn the first few decades of Title IX’s existence, the Department of Education—and its \npredecessor-in-enforcement,  the  Department  of  Health,  Education,  and  Welfare—primarily \nissued regulations covering hiring, admissions, and athletics.  Helped by the Supreme Court, the \nDepartment then extended § 1681’s anti-discrimination mandate to cases of sexual harassment \nand retaliation.  See Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 75 (1992) (extending \nTitle IX to sexual harassment); Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 173–74 \n(2005) (extending Title IX to retaliation). \n \n1We are aware that the Federal Register recently published a final rule amending the Department of \nEducation’s Title IX regulations, which go into effect August 1, 2024.  See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Final Rule: \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, \n89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, 2024).  This new rule does not moot this case for two reasons.  First, the final rule \ndoes not go into effect until August 2024.  Second, the final rule does not cover everything that is covered by the \ndocuments, like housing and athletics.  So even once the rule goes into effect, it will not change the fact that the laws \nof the Plaintiff States will still conflict with the Department’s policies in these areas.   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 8 of 59   PageID #: 2634\n \n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 4 (9 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 4 \n \nIn 1997, the Department issued guidance recognizing that harassment of a sexual nature \ndirected at gay or lesbian students may constitute sexual harassment prohibited by Title IX.  \nSexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or \nThird  Parties,  62  Fed.  Reg.  12034,  12039  (Mar.  13,  1997)  (revised  in  2001), \nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1997-03-13/pdf/97-6373.pdf.    Title  IX  protects \nstudents “even if the harasser and the person being harassed are members of the same sex.”  Id.  \nBut the Department made clear that “Title IX does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation.”  Id.2  \nThen,  in  2014,  the  Office  for  Civil  Rights  (“OCR”)—the  Department’s  sub-agency \ntasked with enforcing civil rights laws—issued a Q&A document stating that Title IX protects \n“straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students” from “sexual violence.”  U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., Office for Civil Rights,  Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence at \n5 (Apr. 29,  2014)  (rescinded  in  2017),  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-\n201404-title-ix.pdf.    Then  in  2016,  OCR  issued  a  letter  saying  Title  IX  “encompasses \ndiscrimination  based  on  a  student’s  gender  identity,  including  discrimination  based  on  a \nstudent’s  transgender  status.”    C.R.  Div.  &  Off.  for  C.R.,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Justice  &  U.S. \nDep’t of Educ.,  Dear  Colleague  Letter  on  Transgender  Students  at  1  (May  13,  2016) \n(rescinded in 2017), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-\ntransgender.pdf.  Both documents have since been rescinded.  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for \nCivil  Rights,  Rescinded  Policy  Guidance  (Aug.  16,  2021),  https://www2.ed.gov/about\n/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/rr/policyguidance/respolicy.html. \nNext, in early 2021, the Department’s general counsel issued a memorandum on the \neffect of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBostock held that an employer violates Title VII, which makes it unlawful to discriminate in \nemployment against an individual “because of sex,” by firing an individual for being gay or \ntransgender.  Id. at 669–71.  The Department’s 2021 memorandum said that Bostock did not \n \n2The Department’s new sexual harassment rules in 2020 did not disturb this finding.

Reg. 30026, \n30178–80 (May 19, 2020) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-05-19/pdf/2020-10512.pdf. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 9 of 59   PageID #: 2635\n \n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 5 (10 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 5 \n \nconstrue Title IX, and that the “Title IX text is very different from Title VII text in many \nimportant  respects,”  including  that  Title  IX  “contains  numerous  exceptions  authorizing  or \nallowing sex-separate activities and intimate facilities to be provided separately on the basis of \nbiological  sex  or  for  members  of  each  biological  sex.”  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ., \nMemorandum Re: Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) at 1 (Jan. 8, 2021) (rescinded \nin  2021),  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/other/ogc-memorandum-\n01082021.pdf.  The memorandum said that “the Department’s long-standing construction of the \nterm ‘sex’ in Title IX” is that it means “biological sex, male or female.”  Id. at 2. \nThis is where our story begins.  The new administration had a different take on Bostock.  \nBasically, the opposite take.  On June 22, 2021, the Department published its “Interpretation” of \nTitle IX in the Federal Register.  Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \nWith Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of \nBostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32637 (June 22, 2021).  The Department noted that \nOCR “at times has stated that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination does not encompass \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.”  Id.  But it explained that, given \nBostock and Title IX’s similarities to Title VII, the Department will now “fully enforce Title IX \nto prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in education programs \nand activities that receive Federal financial assistance from the Department.”  Id. at 32639. \nA  “Dear  Educator”  Letter  followed.  Off.  for  C.R.,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ.,  Letter to \nEducators  on  Title  IX’s  49th  Anniversary  (Letter  to  Educators),  at  *1  (June  23, \n2021), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/educator-202106-\ntix.pdf.  The letter told Title IX recipients about the Notice of Interpretation and reiterated that \nthe Department “will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity.”  Id. at *2. \nThe letter also attached a “Fact Sheet.”  C.R. Div. & Off. for C.R., U.S. Dep’t of Justice \nand U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for \nStudents  and  Families  (Fact  Sheet),  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-\nfactsheet-tix-202106.pdf.  The Fact Sheet asserts that “discrimination against students based on \ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by federal \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 10 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2636\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 6 (11 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 6 \n \nlaw.”  Id.  The Fact Sheet also provides examples of what types of claims the Department may \ninvestigate.  To name a few, these claims include preventing a “‘transgender high school girl’ \nfrom using the ‘girls’ restroom,’” “preventing a ‘transgender high school girl’ from ‘trying out \nfor the girls’ cheerleading team,’” and “failing to use a transgender student’s preferred name or \npronouns.”  R. 1, Compl., PageID 13–14 (quoting R. 1-4, Exhibit C, PageID 73).  \nThe  Fact  Sheet  adds  that  Title  IX’s  financial  recipients  “have  a  responsibility  to \ninvestigate and address sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, against students because \nof their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity.”  R. 1-4, PageID 73.  And the \nDepartment “can also provide information to assist schools in meeting their legal obligations.” \nId. \nOn August 30, 2021, twenty states3 sued, challenging the legality of these Documents.4  \nThe Plaintiff States operate educational programs and activities that receive federal funding and \nare thus subject to Title IX’s requirements.  The States allege that the Department’s Documents \nare procedurally and substantively unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), \nTitle IX, and the U.S. Constitution.  \nThe States moved for a preliminary injunction on September 2, 2021.  They requested \nthat the district court enjoin the Department from enforcing the challenged Documents until the \ncase is resolved on the merits.  The Department filed a response, as well as a motion to dismiss \nfor lack of subject  matter jurisdiction and failure to  state plausible claims for relief.  The \nDepartment  presented  identical  arguments  in  its  motion  to  dismiss  and  its  response  to  the \nPlaintiff States’ motion for preliminary injunction.  So the district court decided to resolve both \nmotions in the context of whether a preliminary injunction was warranted.  In an order granting \nthe States a preliminary injunction (and denying the motion to dismiss), the district court found \n \n3Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nMissouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia. \n4In district court, the States also challenged the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s issuance of \na “technical assistance document.”  On appeal, the Department no longer defends the merits of that document \nbecause another court has set it aside nationwide.  See Texas v. EEOC, 633 F. Supp. 3d 824, 847 (N.D. Tex. 2022).  \nGiven that the Department has abandoned that aspect of its appeal, we won’t review the issue.  See Robinson v. \nJones, 142 F.3d 905, 906 (6th Cir. 1998); Nichols v. United States, 285 F.3d 445, 447 n.1 (6th Cir. 2002).   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 11 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2637\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 7 (12 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 7 \n \nthat the States have standing, the Department’s Documents are reviewable, and the States’ claim \nthat the Documents had to go through notice and comment is likely to succeed.5  On that basis, \nthe court enjoined and restrained the implementation of the Documents against the Plaintiff \nStates.  The Department timely appealed. \nII. \nWe first consider whether the States’ claims are justiciable.  See, e.g., Kentucky v. Yellen, \n54 F.4th 325, 335 (6th Cir. 2022).  This Court reviews standing questions de novo.  Sullivan v. \nBenningfield, 920 F.3d 401, 407 (6th Cir. 2019).  And because this case is at the preliminary-\ninjunction  stage,  the  States  must  only  show  “a  ‘substantial  likelihood’  of  standing”  to  be \n“entitled to a preliminary injunction.”  Memphis A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, 978 F.3d \n378, 386 (6th Cir. 2020).  If any State can’t make this showing, we must deny it preliminary \nrelief, but we don’t have to dismiss the State from the case, as long as one State has standing.  Id.  \nTo have standing, the States must establish an injury that is (1) actual or imminent as well as \nconcrete and particularized, (2) traceable to the Documents, and (3) likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.  See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).   \nWe consider three theories supporting the States’ standing: (1) a proprietary-interest \ntheory, (2) a sovereign-interest theory, and (3) a procedural-rights theory.  In the end, all twenty \nPlaintiff  States  show  a  substantial  likelihood  of  standing  sufficient  to  obtain  a  preliminary \ninjunction.6 \nA. \nFirst, the proprietary-interest theory.  States have “proprietary” standing to sue if state \nentities “reliant on the states’ coffers” will “become subject” to federal regulations that threaten \nthose coffers.  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 594–95 (6th Cir. 2022); see also Minnesota v. \n \n5The district court did not address the likelihood of success of the States’ other claims.  We similarly don’t \naddress the likelihood of success of those other claims today. \n6Arizona did not join the other nineteen states in briefing on appeal but is still a plaintiff in this suit.  Given \nthat “an appellee doesn’t even have to file a response brief,” Anderson v. Knox County, Case No. 22-5280, 2023 WL \n4536078, at *7 (6th Cir. July 12, 2023) (citing Fed. R.

Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 8 \n \nN. Sec. Co., 194 U.S. 48, 68 (1904) (acknowledging that states possess protectable proprietary \ninterests).7  A state “is bound to have a variety of proprietary interests.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, \nInc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982).  “A State may, for example, own \nland or participate in a business venture,” in which case “it is likely to have the same interests as \nother similarly situated proprietors” and “may at times need to pursue those interests in court.”  \nId. at 601–02; see also Bldg. & Const. Trades Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. Allbaugh, 295 F.3d 28, 35 \n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (The “Government unquestionably is the proprietor of its own funds, and when \nit acts to ensure the most effective use of those funds, it is acting in a proprietary capacity.”).  For \ninstance, state universities fall under the purview of these interests, including to the extent that \nthey receive federal funding.  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th at 594–95.  \nIndeed, for 70 years a state has been able to assert Article III standing via injuries to a \nstate university—the state’s “agency in the educational field.”  Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, \n371 (1953); see id. at 370 (holding that Arkansas had Article III standing to represent the \ninterests of the University of Arkansas because under Arkansas law “the University of Arkansas \nis  an  official  state  instrumentality”  and  “any  injury . . . to  the  University  is  an  injury  to \nArkansas”).  And the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that a state “seek[s] to protect its own \ninterests” when it enters court to redress the harms of an instrumentality of the state, such as a \nstate university.  Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2366–67 (2023) (holding that a state had \nstanding because its “instrumentality” that suffered an injury “was created by the State to further \na public purpose, is governed by state officials and state appointees, reports to the State, and may \nbe dissolved by the State”).   \nThe Department concedes that, because of the Documents, the States may sustain injuries \n“in their capacity as employers or educators.”  Appellants Br. at 31.  This is true for various \nreasons.  For example, as the States note, a regulation that prohibits “discrimination on the basis \nof  gender  identity  allows  the  Department  to  take  action  against  a  school  that  only  allows \n(biological) girls to try out for girls’ teams.”  States Br. at 18.  On top of that, under the \n \n7A state’s proprietary interests are distinct from its sovereign interests.  A “proprietary” interest is the right \nof a state to run its own schools, universities, hospitals, etc., much like the proprietor of a private school or hospital.  \nSee Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982).  But a state’s sovereign \ninterests are unique to states as separate sovereigns, for these are the rights of the sovereign to regulate others.  \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 13 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2639\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 9 (14 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 9 \n \nDocuments, the Department may take enforcement action against any school that regulates entry \nto restrooms based on biological sex.  Plus, the Documents impose new duties on the States.  The \nStates  must  now  “investigate  and  address  sex  discrimination,  including  sexual  harassment, \nagainst students because of their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity.”  Fact \nSheet, supra.  And what if the States don’t investigate or address incidents in the way the \nDocuments  specify?    By  not  complying,  the  States’  schools  face  legal  and  financial \nconsequences because of Title IX’s enforcement mechanisms.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1682.   \nThis fear is not unfounded.  It comes directly from the text of the Documents.  The \nDepartment  says  it  “will  fully  enforce  Title  IX  to  prohibit  discrimination  based  on  sexual \norientation  and  gender  identity”  in  a  way  that  is  “[c]onsistent  with  the  analysis”  in  the \nDocuments.  Enforcement of Title IX, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32639.  The Department also indicates \nthat the position expressed in the Documents’ is now the “interpretation” moving forward, while \nnoting that this agency action “supersedes and replaces any prior inconsistent statements made \nby the Department.”  Id.  Not to mention, both the regulation and “Dear Educator” Letter \nreiterate that the Department “will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity.” Id.; Letter to Educators, supra, at *2.  \nAlongside the threat of enforcement come the penalties the Department can impose.  Title \nIX allows the Department to suspend or terminate federal education funding if it doesn’t achieve \nvoluntary compliance.8  20 U.S.C. § 1682; see 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(a).  And aside from a loss of \n \n8At argument, the Department’s counsel stated that it has not and would not enforce the Documents in \nenforcement actions against the Plaintiff States.  And on that reasoning, the Department argued that “any harm that \nthe states have suffered is not traceable to these documents.”  Oral Argument at 9:55.  The Supreme Court rejected a \nsimilar  argument  in  West  Virginia  v.  EPA,  597  U.S.  697  (2022).    There,  the  government  argued  that  any \n“possibility” of an injury was “eliminated” because the “EPA informed the Court of Appeals that it does not intend \nto enforce the Clean Power Plan.”  Id. at 719.  The Court recognized this maneuver for what it was: an attempt to \nmoot the case.  Id.  It was a voluntary cessation argument in disguise.  Id. at 720.  Courts are rightly skeptical about \ntaking a party at its word that it will not enforce something when enforcement is within its discretion.   \nIndeed, it is “well settled that ‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a \nfederal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.’”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (quoting City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 \n(1982)).  Otherwise, “courts would be compelled to leave the defendant free to return to his old ways.”  Id. (cleaned \nup).  A defendant bears the burden of establishing “that a once-live case has become moot.”  West Virginia, 597 U.S. \nat 719.  And that burden is “heavy” where, as here, the “only conceivable basis for a finding of mootness in the case \nis the respondent’s voluntary conduct.”  Id. (quoting Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189).  The Department’s \n“mootness argument boils down to its representation that [it] has no intention of enforcing” its policy.  Id. at 720.  \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 14 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2640\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 10 (15 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 10 \n \nfunding, the Department can take any other means authorized by law, such as referring the \nmatter to the Department of Justice.  34 C.F.R. § 100.8(a). \nThe  Documents  threaten  the  States’  educational  institutions  with  financial  penalties, \nspecifically the revocation of federal funds, if they don’t comply with the policies outlined in its \nletter.  This is an injury to the States as proprietors of their educational institutions and is \nsufficient to confer standing.  And because all twenty States operate educational institutions, \neach State has standing under the proprietary-interest theory.   \nThe  next  question  is  whether  that  injury  is  imminent.    It  is.    For  pre-enforcement \nchallenges, a party may establish imminence with “an adequate showing that sometime in the \nrelatively near future” it will “continue” an action that “allegedly violates the law.”  Kentucky v. \nBiden, 23 F.4th at 602 (citation omitted) (reasoning that a plaintiff established imminence by \nshowing a history of bidding on contracts that would allegedly violate a new mandate and by \nasserting that it would “likely” bid on contracts in the future).  \nThe States “have shown that their existing” policies dealing with biological sex-separated \nprograms  are  “threatened  with  modification”  under  the  Documents,  that  federal  education \nfunding  provides  “critical  funding  for  their  functions,”  that  they  are  “likely  to  continue” \nenforcing their policies while accepting federal funds, that such funding is “likely subject to the \n[Documents’] mandate, and that resistance to the [Documents’] mandate will likely lead either to \nthe loss of [funding] or difficulty executing” education programs.  Id. at 601.  In short, because \nthe States allege that they are “likely” to continue doing what the Documents prohibit, “we are \nsatisfied that” they have “standing to bring this lawsuit.”  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, \n515 U.S. 200, 212 (1995).   \nAny remaining doubt about imminence is resolved when we consider the fact that, under \nthe  Documents,  the  schools  now  “have  a  responsibility  to  investigate  and  address  sex \ndiscrimination, including sexual harassment, against students because of their perceived or actual \n \nSo “voluntary cessation does not moot a case” unless it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior \ncould not reasonably be expected to recur.”  Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. \n701, 719 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And given that the Department “vigorously defends” the \nlegality of the Documents, it’s not “clear.”  See id. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 15 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2641\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 11 (16 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 11 \n \nsexual orientation or gender identity.”  R. 1-4, PageID 73.  And the Department tells schools that \nthese are “legal obligations” that they must “meet[].”  Id.  The schools previously didn’t have to \ninvestigate scenarios which they do not consider to be sex discrimination, but now they do.  \nThese harms aren’t just imminent; they apparently require action now.  So we need not wait and \nsee whether any actual conflict arises—as the Department would have us do.9   \nUp next, traceability and redressability.  The injury here is traceable to the Documents.  \nSee Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  On the one hand, we have a new position on what sex discrimination \ncan include, requiring states to both investigate different forms of discrimination and get rid of \npolicies to the contrary.  On the other, we know that the Department “will fully enforce” its new \nposition on Title IX.  Enforcement of Title IX, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32639.  Indeed, the Department \nhas stated a position to only enforce Title IX with its new interpretation going forward, not “any \nprior inconsistent” ones.  Id.  And, for the same reasons, the States’ injuries will be redressed by \na favorable ruling enjoining the enforcement of the Documents against them.10  \n   \n \n9It is true that “many federal constitutional rights are as a practical matter asserted typically as defenses to \nstate-law claims, not in federal pre-enforcement cases like this one.”  Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. \n30, 49–50 (2021).  But the harm here is not a “possibility.”  Id. at 49.  Nor is it based on a “highly attenuated chain \nof possibilities.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013).  Rather, as explained, the States make a \nsubstantial showing that the Department will “fully enforce” the new position—and only that position.  Enforcement \nof Title IX, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32639.  So the injury here is “certainly impending.”  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 410. \n10In challenging traceability and redressability, the Department argues that the injuries stem from Bostock \nand Title IX, not the Documents.  The Department cites School of the Ozarks v. Biden in support of its argument that \nthe states have failed to establish traceability and redressability.  41 F.4th 992 (8th Cir. 2022).  That case, however, \ndoes not answer the question before us.  In Ozarks, the challenger “failed to show that enjoining officials from \nimplementing” an “internal” agency directive “would redress any injury allegedly arising” from the document \n“because the agency retain[ed] the authority and responsibility to carry out the same enforcement activity based on \nthe statute alone.”  Id. at 1001.  The Ozarks court reasoned that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment would still have to “investigat[e] all complaints of sex discrimination . . . including complaints of \ndiscrimination because of gender identity or sexual orientation.”  Id.  And it added that the agency “must consider \nthe meaning of the Fair Housing Act in light of Bostock and its interpretation of similar statutory language.”  Id.   \nOzarks’s logic is questionable.  It hinges on the premise that even if the agency didn’t use its documents, \nthe agency could still get to the same outcome by interpreting the underlying statute in a way that tracks the \ndocuments.  But that’s not at all clear in this case.  Unlike in School of the Ozarks, the Documents here are not \ninternal agency memoranda.  Instead, they tell regulated entities, including the States, that they must take affirmative \nsteps to investigate forms of sex discrimination that they previously were under no obligation to pursue.  Failure to \ndo so puts them at risk of losing their funding. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 16 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2642\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 12 (17 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 12 \n \nTaken  together,  the  States  are  trapped  between  choosing  to  enforce  state  laws  or \nreceiving federal funds, all while having to investigate gender-identity and sexual-orientation \ndiscrimination (unlike before).  Thus, the injuries here are “fairly traceable to the challenged \naction of the defendant,” and “a favorable decision” will redress these injuries.  Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 560–61 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nB. \nSecond, the sovereign-interest theory.  States cannot “bypass proof of injury,” but, in \ntheir capacities as sovereigns, they can incur injuries that private parties cannot.  See Arizona v. \nBiden, 40 F.4th 375, 385–86 (6th Cir. 2022).  For instance, states have Article III standing when \n“quasi-sovereign rights [are] actually invaded or threatened.”  Ariz. State Legislature v. Ariz. \nIndep. Redistricting Comm’n, 576 U.S. 787, 802 n.10 (2015) (quoting Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 U.S. 447, 485 (1923)).  Relevant here, “a State clearly has a legitimate interest in the \ncontinued enforceability of its own statutes.”  Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986).  So \n“when a federal regulation purports to preempt state law,” states have “a sovereign interest to sue \nthe United States.”  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th at 598 (collecting cases).11   \nThat makes sense.  The “history and tradition” of sovereign interests shows that such \ninterests can establish Article III standing.  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023) \n(quoting Sprint Commc’ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 274 (2008)).  So “precedent, \nhistory, or tradition of courts” inform our understanding of whether a state has established an \nArticle III injury.  Id. at 677.  Looking to those sources here reveals important background \n \n11See Alfred L. Snapp, 458 U.S. at 601 (recognizing that interference with a state’s sovereign “power to \ncreate and enforce a legal code” is sufficient to establish Article III standing); Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, \n431 (1920) (exercising jurisdiction over a case because Missouri’s lawsuit “is a reasonable and proper means to \nassert the alleged quasi sovereign rights of a State” against federal regulation); Yellen, 54 F.4th at 336 (concluding \nthat states had standing from threats to their “enacted or planned . . . tax cuts” because of their “powerful sovereign \nprerogative under federalism principles to control their own internal taxation policies”); Saginaw County v. STAT \nEmergency Med. Servs., Inc., 946 F.3d 951, 957 (6th Cir. 2020) (noting that Article III standing can be met if a state \nfaces “some tangible interference with its authority to regulate or to enforce its laws”); Ohio ex rel.

Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 13 \n \nprinciples about states’ ability to protect their sovereign interests, such as regulating education \nwithin their borders.   \nThe understanding that states could assert their sovereign interests against the federal \ngovernment appears often in Founding-era evidence.  Key among the talking points in the \nframing of our Constitution was federalism, the innovative mode of government we still embrace \ntoday.  The Constitution delegated “few and defined” powers to the federal government, while \nthe states retained “a very extensive portion of active sovereignty.”  The Federalist No. 45, at \n286, 289 (James Madison) (C. Rossiter ed., 1961).  Indeed, the powers that “remain in the State \ngovernments are numerous and indefinite.”  Id. at 289.  As James Wilson famously explained, \nthe Constitution’s federalist structure ensured that, for state governments, “every thing which is \nnot  given, is  reserved.”   James Wilson’s State House Yard Speech  October 6, 1787,  in 1 \nCollected Works of James Wilson 171, 171–76 (Kermit L. Hall & Mark David Hall eds., 2007).12  \nThis meant that the “powers reserved to the several States [would] extend to all the objects \nwhich, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, \nand the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.”  The Federalist No. 45, at \n289.13   \nYet some remained skeptical about the division of power.  See, e.g., Letters from a \nFederal Farmer No. 18 (1788), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 339, 345 (H. Storing ed., \n1981) (“[T]he stipulations of a state, or of the inhabitants of the place ceded, can be of but little \navail against the power and gradual encroachments of the union.”).  Anti-Federalists worried that \nthe Constitution was “designedly framed[] to reduce the state governments to mere corporations, \n \n12This speech was republished in thirty-four newspapers across every state except Delaware and North \nCarolina.  J. Rakove, Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution 144 n.36 (1996). \n13It is worth mentioning that the ability to pass and enact laws has been a cornerstone of legislatures’ \npowers  dating  back  at  least  to  the  English  Bill  of  Rights  of  1689,  which  denounced—as  one  of  its  chief \ncomplaints—the King “Assumeing and Exerciseing a Power of Dispensing with and Suspending of Lawes and the \nExecution of Lawes without Consent of Parlyament.”  An Act Declareing the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and \nSetleing the Succession of the Crowne (Bill of Rights), 1 W. & M. 2, c. 2 (1689).  The power of a legislature to \nenact its own legislation proved so important that when James Madison “proposed giving the national government \nan unlimited veto over all state laws,” the idea was rejected, and the convention instead adopted a system that \nretained state sovereignty over its own legislation—a plan in which “most framers agreed that the scope of national \nlawmaking would remain modest,” and the “most numerous objects of legislation” would “belong to the states.”  \nRakove, supra, at 168–69, 179. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 18 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2644\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 14 (19 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 14 \n \nand eventually to annihilate them.”  J. Rakove, Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the \nMaking of the Constitution 182 (1996); see also Brutus 1 (1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-\nFederalist, supra, at 367 (lamenting that the Constitution, through the Necessary and Proper \nClause, allows the federal government to “exercise this power as entirely to annihilate all the \nstate governments, and reduce this country to one single government”). \nTo address these concerns, the Framers assured the public that the federal government \nwould “at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of the state governments, and these will \nhave the same disposition towards the [federal] government.”  The Federalist No. 28, at 176–77 \n(Alexander  Hamilton);  see  also  id.  at  177  (“[T]he  State  Governments  will,  in  all  possible \ncontingencies, afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the National \nauthority.”).  So even if the federal government “invaded” the rights of the people, the people \ncould still “make use of” the state government “as the instrument of redress.”  Id.  Put simply, \nthe “different governments will control each other, at the same time that each will be controlled \nby itself.”  The Federalist No. 51, at 320 (James Madison).  Indeed, it was understood that the \nfederal government may not just be “the sword” in all cases, but “sometimes be appealed to as \nthe arbiter of [states’] differences.”  The Federalist No. 7, at 56 (Alexander Hamilton).   \nImportant here, among the sovereign “powers” that the Constitution “reserved to the \nStates” was the ability to regulate the education of their citizens.  U.S. Const. amend. X; see \nUnited  States  v.  Lopez,  514  U.S.  549,  580  (1995)  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring)  (“[I]t  is  well \nestablished that education is a traditional concern of the States.”).  Nothing in the Constitution \n“was designed to interfere with the power of the state, sometimes termed its police power, to \nprescribe regulations to promote the . . . education . . . of the people.”  Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 U.S. 27, 31 (1884); see Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968) (“By and large, \npublic education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities.”); San \nAntonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 55 (1973) (“We are unwilling to assume for \nourselves a level of wisdom superior to that of legislators, scholars, and educational authorities in \n50 States.”).  And the states’ strong interest in regulating education hasn’t changed.  See, e.g., \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 19 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2645\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 15 (20 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 15 \n \nBrown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954) (“Today, education is perhaps the most \nimportant function of state and local governments.”).14 \nSo we know that preemption of a state law is an injury that gives rise to Article III \nstanding because it infringes a state’s sovereign interests.  The next question is: at this stage of \nthe suit, do any of the States here sufficiently show that injury?  The answer: yes.15   \n \n14This is not to suggest that an injury based on a state’s sovereign interests is cognizable only when it \nimpacts an area “traditionally” regulated by the states, such as education.  States can suffer an injury affecting their \nsovereign interests even when they regulate beyond “traditional” areas of state regulation.  See, e.g., Celebrezze, 766 \nF.2d at 229 (6th Cir. 1985) (involving preemption of an Ohio statute that “requires prenotification of shipment into \nor through the State of any large quantity of special nuclear material or by-product material”).   \nBut we also do not suggest that states suffer an injury to their sovereign interests any time the federal \ngovernment purports to regulate in an area of “traditional” state concern, such as education.  Such an assertion \nwould likely run headlong into the Mellon bar.  See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 482 (1923). \n15Multiple states do not show a state policy that conflicted with the Documents at the time the States filed \ntheir complaint. See Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 830 (1989) (“The existence of federal \njurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed.”).  So although these states can \nshow a likelihood that they have standing under procedural-rights and proprietary-interest theories, it’s unlikely that \nthey have standing under a sovereign-interest theory.   \nBut, even if these states couldn’t make a showing of standing under any theory, the states could stay in this \nsuit thanks to the one-party rule.  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst’l Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006).  \nAlternatively, because no court would have made a “final judgment on the merits” for these states, Montana v. \nUnited States, 440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979), they could bring suit again without res judicata concerns—asserting on the \nsecond go-around that they have standing based on new laws.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02(B) (“Athletic teams \nor sports designated for ‘females’, ‘women’ or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the male sex.”); Ga. Code Ann. \n§ 20-2-316(c)(1)(E)(v) (amended 2022) (“If the athletic association determines that it is necessary and appropriate to \nprohibit students whose gender is male from participating in athletic events that are designated for students whose \ngender is female, then the athletic association may adopt a policy to that effect; provided, however, that such policy \nshall be applied to all of the athletic association’s participating public high schools.”); Ind.

To start, \nthey  allege  that  they  “maintain  laws  or  policies  that  at  least  arguably  conflict”  with  the \nDocuments.  R. 1, PageID 19, ¶ 99 (citing state laws).  They’re correct.  The Department’s stance \non sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination conflicts with how these states regulate \neducation—separating students based on biological sex, whether in school sports, restrooms, or \nin some other way.  \nKeeping  in  mind  the  novel  policy  expressed  in  the  Documents,  several  states  had \nconflicting policies in place at the time the complaint was filed.16  As we have explained, the \nStates  have  a  sovereign  interest  in  regulating  education,  so  the  Documents  give  rise  to  a \nsovereign injury.  Given the “precedent, history, or tradition of courts,” states can protect their \ntraditional lawmaking authority.  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. at 677.  Our recent cases have \nacknowledged that the sovereign injury here—a state’s ability to enforce its laws, particularly \nover a traditional sovereign prerogative like education—is sufficient to confer standing.  See \nKentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th at 598–99.  Consistent with our precedent, several states can show \ntheir “own, contrary [education] policy, and that the [new federal policy] threatens to override \nthose policies.”  Id. at 599.  So our precedent aligns with what the original understanding \nconfirms: States can “sue the United States when a federal regulation purports to preempt state \nlaw.”  Id. at 598. \n \nthe female sex, unless no team designated for females in that sport is offered at the school in which the student is \nenrolled. . . . Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the \nmale sex.”); S.D. Codified Laws § 13-67-1 (“Only female students, based on their biological sex, may participate in \nany team, sport, or athletic event designated as being for females, women, or girls.”).   \n16See, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-6-310(a) (“A student’s gender for purposes of participation in a public \nmiddle school or high school interscholastic athletic activity or event must be determined by the student’s sex at the \ntime of the student’s birth.”); Ala. Code § 16-1-52(b)(2) (“A public K–12 school may not allow a biological female \nto participate on a male team if there is a female team in a sport.

Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 17 \n \nSo the sovereign-interest theory shows another injury suffered by the States, an injury to \ntheir  interest  in  enforcing  their  duly  enacted  laws  without  contradiction  from  the  federal \ngovernment.  As for imminence, traceability, and redressability, the analysis under the sovereign-\ninterest theory is similar to the analysis discussed above for the proprietary-interest theory.  The \ninjury is imminent because the Department has made clear that it will investigate states not in \ncompliance with its new regime, thus putting the Plaintiff States on a collision course with the \nfederal government.  For traceability, the States’ sovereign injuries are “fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, because the Department’s stance on \ndiscrimination conflicts with how the States regulate education.  And, as mentioned under the \nproprietary-interest  theory,  a  court  can  likely  redress  the  States’  injuries  with  “a  favorable \ndecision” by holding that the Documents are not enforceable against the Plaintiff States.  Id. at \n561 (citation omitted). \nC. \n  Proprietary and sovereign interests aside, all twenty States have a substantial likelihood \nof standing under a procedural-rights theory.17  We have long recognized that parties have \nArticle III standing when an agency action allegedly did not abide by procedural requirements \nthat are designed to protect the plaintiff’s concrete interests.  See Dismas Charities, Inc. v. DOJ, \n401 F.3d 666, 677–78 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiffs had standing because they had \nconcrete interests that 5 U.S.C. § 553’s “procedures” were “designed to protect” (quoting Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 573 n.8)).  And that remains the case even if, on the merits, we determine that an \nagency doesn’t “clearly” have to comply with the alleged procedural requirements after all.  Id. \nat 677.  The procedural-rights theory requires that the States meet two requirements: Article III \nstanding and prudential standing.  Id. at 671.  \n  The States must first have Article III standing.  Under a procedural-rights theory, “when a \nstatute affords a litigant ‘a procedural right to protect his concrete interests,’ the litigant may \nestablish Article III jurisdiction  without meeting the usual  ‘standards for redressability  and \n \n17The district court did not analyze Article III standing using the procedural-rights theory.  Even so, we \nmay affirm on any ground supported by the record, even if not relied on by the district court.  See Dismas Charities, \nInc. v. DOJ, 401 F.3d 666, 677 (6th Cir. 2005); United States v. Hudgins, 52 F.3d 115, 118 (6th Cir. 1995). \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 22 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2648\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 18 (23 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 18 \n \nimmediacy.’”  Dep’t of Educ. v. Brown, 600 U.S. 551, 561 (2023) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n572 n.7).  But the litigant must have a “concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation of the \nclaimed right.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  So “[o]nly a ‘person who has been \naccorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting \nall the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.’”  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 \nU.S. 488, 496 (2009) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7).  This Court has recognized that the \n“requirements of notice and comment prior to rulemaking” fit within a procedural-rights theory \nbecause they give persons with “concrete interests” affected by a regulation the “chance to argue \nto [an agency] that its policy is wrong before the policy is adopted.”  Dismas Charities, 401 F.3d \nat 677.  And “concrete” interests can include a plaintiff’s “interest in continuing to provide \nservices” that the agency action at issue stops.  Id.  \n  Given this framework, the States here have “concrete interests” that the “procedural \nrequirements of notice and comment prior to rulemaking . . . certainly protect.”  Id.  The APA \nrequires agencies to engage in “notice and comment” for legislative rules.18  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–\n(c).  And the States allege that the Department’s Documents are “legislative rules that were \nadopted without the required notice-and-comment procedures.”  R. 1, PageID 22, ¶ 119.  \nIf the APA’s procedures are “applicable,” the States are in the same position as the \nplaintiff  in  Dismas  Charities,  401  F.3d  at  677.    To  start,  the  APA’s  notice-and-comment \nprocedures  would  have  given  the  States  a  “chance  to  argue”  that  Education’s  Title  IX \n“policy [wa]s  wrong  before  the  policy  [wa]s  adopted.”   Id.;  see  R. 1,  PageID  24,  ¶ 131 \n(“The Department’s  Interpretation  and  Fact  Sheet  are  contrary  to  law  and  exceed  the \nDepartment’s statutory authority because Bostock’s interpretation of Title VII’s language is \ninapplicable  to  Title  IX’s  materially  different  language.”);  id.  ¶ 133  (“The  Department’s \nInterpretation and Fact Sheet are contrary to law because Title IX and longstanding Department \nregulations expressly permit distinctions based on biological sex in certain circumstances.”). \nAnd the States have an “interest in continuing to provide services” at public schools that \nseparate programs and activities based on biological sex.  Dismas Charities, 401 F.3d at 677.  \n \n18More on legislative rules below. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 23 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2649\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 19 (24 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 19 \n \nIn particular, the States seek to keep their “laws and policies, and established sex-separated \nrestrooms, locker rooms, showers, residence halls, and other living facilities” that they made “in \nreliance  on  their  understanding  that  Title  IX”  does  “not  prohibit  those  laws,  policies,  and \npractices.”  R. 1, PageID 20, ¶ 106.  Seeing how the procedural requirements of the APA seeks \nto protect those “concrete interests,” the States have Article III standing “to challenge the [the \nDepartment’s Documents] on the ground that notice and comment rulemaking was required \nbefore the [Documents] could be put into effect.”  Dismas Charities, 401 F.3d at 677.   \n  We next turn to the procedural-rights theory’s second requirement: “prudential standing.”  \nId. at 674–77; see Nat’l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Tr. Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 \n(1998) (interpreting 5 U.S.C. § 702 to require all parties “adversely affected or aggrieved” by a \nfinal agency action to have prudential standing).  To establish prudential standing, we determine \nwhether the States have an interest that “arguably [falls] within the zone of interests to be \nprotected or regulated by the statute” in question.  Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. \nCamp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970).  We answer that inquiry in two parts: (1) we determine what \ninterests  the  statute  arguably  was  intended  to  protect;  and  (2) we  determine  whether  the \n“plaintiff’s interests affected by the agency action in question are among them.”  Bangura v. \nHansen, 434 F.3d 487, 499 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 522 U.S. at \n492).  Importantly, the “test is not meant to be especially demanding; in particular, there need be \nno indication of congressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff.”  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. \nAss’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399–400 (1987) (footnote omitted). \nAs  to  the  first  part,  the  APA’s  notice-and-comment  rulemaking  requirements  were \n“intended to ‘assure fairness and mature consideration of rules of general application.’”  Dismas \nCharities, 401 F.3d at 678 (quoting NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759, 764 (1969) \n(plurality opinion)).  At the same time, they seek to “give those with interests affected by rules \nthe chance to participate in the promulgation of the rules.”  Id.   \nAs to the second part, the States’ interests are among those that the APA was designed to \nprotect.  See Bangura, 434 F.3d at 499.  The States “oversee and operate educational institutions \nand other educational programs and activities that receive federal funding and thus are subject to \nthe requirements of Title  IX.”  R. 1, PageID 5, ¶ 15.  Since the States are objects  of the \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 24 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2650\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 20 (25 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 20 \n \nDocuments, the notice-and-comment process was designed to give them an “opportunity to \nparticipate in and influence agency decision making at an early stage.”  Dismas Charities, 401 \nF.3d at 678 (citation omitted).  Not only that.  Almost every Plaintiff State faces a “threatened \ninjury to [the] enforcement” of its laws, which falls “within the zone of interests of” the APA and \nTitle IX.  Ohio ex rel. Celebrezze v.  U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 233 (6th Cir. 1985).  \nOur Court has long acknowledged that a state has “standing to challenge [an agency’s] regulation \nand undertake to vindicate its own law” when the state statute was “endangered and rendered \nuncertain by the formal position of” an agency that the state statute was “preempted.”  Id.   \nAs a result, the States’ interests fall “squarely within the zone of interests protected by the \nnotice and comment requirements of the APA.”  Dismas Charities, 401 F.3d at 679.  The States \ntherefore show a substantial likelihood of both constitutional and prudential standing for their \nprocedural-rights claim. \nIn sum, the Department has adopted a new position on its enforcement of Title IX.  \nWhether that position is a legislative rule is a matter for the merits.  But for standing purposes, \nwe know this much: thanks to whatever the Department published in the Federal Register, the \nDepartment is now locked into that position moving forward.  We know that it “will fully \nenforce” that position, not “any prior inconsistent” ones.  Enforcement of Title IX, 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 32639.  The States, which depend on federal education funds under Title IX, are the “objects” \nof this regulatory position.  Most of them also have laws on the books that likely conflict with \nthat position.  And because the Department skipped the notice-and-comment process, the States \nlacked a chance to argue that the Department’s new Title IX policy was wrong before it was \nissued.  Seeing that the States are stuck between the rock of being forced to comply with these \nregulations by abrogating state policies and the hard place of being threatened with enforcement \nunder Title IX, despite being unable to voice their concerns, we hold that they show a substantial \nlikelihood of Article III standing to support the district court’s preliminary injunction. \nIII. \nNext up, reviewability.  Reviewability is what it sounds like.  It deals with whether \nfederal courts can hear certain claims.  The Department makes three arguments for why we \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 25 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2651\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 21 (26 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 21 \n \ncannot review the Documents: (1) the Documents are not “final” agency action;19 (2) Title IX \nprovides an adequate alternative remedy for the States, so reviewing their claims under the APA \nis improper; and (3) Title IX impliedly precludes pre-enforcement actions like this.  We reject \neach of these arguments in turn.20  \nA. \nFirst, the Documents are “final” agency action.  Courts, of course, can only review an \nagency action under the APA if it is “final.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  We take a “‘pragmatic’ approach” \nto finality.  U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 599 (2016) (quoting Abbott \nLab’ys v. Gardener, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)).  With that pragmatic approach in mind, an \nagency action is  final  if it is  both  (1) “the consummation  of the agency’s decisionmaking \nprocess” and (2) a decision “by which rights or obligations have been determined or from which \nlegal  consequences  will  flow.”    Bennett  v.  Spear,  520  U.S.  154,  177–78  (1997)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Here, the parties agree that the first condition is satisfied, so we’ll \nfocus on the second. \n  Our past cases put a gloss on this second condition.  We ask: “Will the agency’s action \n‘impose liability’ on a regulated party, create legal rights [or obligations], or ‘mandate, bind, or \nlimit other government actors’ in the future?” Arizona, 40 F.4th at 387 (quoting Parsons v. DOJ, \n878 F.3d 162, 169 (6th Cir. 2017)).  And we also ask whether the agency’s action has a \n“‘sufficiently direct and immediate’ impact on the aggrieved party and a ‘direct effect on its day-\nto-day business.’”  Berry v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 832 F.3d 627, 633 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting \nAbbott Labs, 387 U.S. at 152).  “Through it all, we will not overlook whether the agency’s action \nputs a party to a ‘Catch-22,’ stuck between heavy compliance costs or feared liability, neither of \n \n19We note that the Department treats the issuance of the three Documents as one agency “action.”  Put \ndifferently, it doesn’t provide independent arguments for why the Fact Sheet isn’t final as compared to the Notice of \nInterpretation.  So we treat the Documents as one “action” too. \n20In this Circuit, the reviewability question is not jurisdictional.  See Haines v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety \nAdmin., 814 F.3d 417, 423–24 (6th Cir. 2016); Jama v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 760 F.3d 490, 494 n.4 (6th Cir. \n2014).  And whether the Documents are interpretive or legislative rules goes to the merits.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–\n(c); id. § 706(2)(D).  So we treat these issues separately, disentangled from the jurisdictional issues above.  See Cal. \nCmtys. Against Toxics v. EPA, 934 F.3d 627, 635 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (explaining that finality analysis is distinct from \ntest for whether agency action is legislative rule). \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 26 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2652\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 22 (27 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 22 \n \nwhich can be undone.”  Arizona, 40 F.4th at 387 (quoting Air Brake Sys. v. Mineta, 357 F.3d \n632, 645 (6th Cir. 2004)). \nTo figure out whether an agency action is binding, we look to the text of the agency \naction to see if it “evoke[s] binding legal effect.”  Id. at 387–88.  In other words, we look to the \n“definitive nature” of the legal  conclusion.   Id. at 388.  We can also look to surrounding \ncontext—for example, how an agency has made use of the action or what it has said about it.  \nSee Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir. 2019). \nUnder this framework,  we find that the Documents bind  the Department to  a legal \nposition and create legal consequences.  First, consider how the Documents bind the Department.  \nThe Notice of Interpretation announces that the Department will “fully enforce Title IX to \nprohibit  discrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity”  in  a  way  that  is \n“[c]onsistent  with  [its]  analysis.”    Enforcement  of  Title  IX,  86 Fed.  Reg.  at  32639.    This \n“supersedes and replaces any prior inconsistent statements made by the Department.”  Id.  The \n“Dear  Educator”  Letter  tells  the  regulated  entitles  that  “Title  IX’s  protection  against  sex \ndiscrimination encompasses discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.”  \nLetter to Educators, supra, at *1.  And the Fact Sheet states that “[i]t is important to know that \ndiscrimination against students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is a form of \nsex discrimination prohibited by federal law.”  Fact Sheet, supra.  Clearly, the Documents do \nmore than express a “privileged viewpoint.”  See Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l Highway Traffic \nSafety Admin., 452 F.3d 798, 808 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nSimply put, the Department leaves itself no room to take the position that Title IX does \nnot prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  See Texas v. EEOC, \n933 F.3d at 443 (“[B]y broadly condemning a [felon-hiring ban] policy or practice . . . the \nGuidance leaves no room for EEOC staff not to issue referrals to the Attorney General when an \nemployer uses a categorical felon-hiring ban.”); Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311, \n319–20 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (holding that EPA guidance was a final agency action because it \nwithdrew agency discretion to refuse to find state emission-control plans non-compliant with \nEPA air quality standards for particular reasons).  Agency actions such as this “legally bind an \nagency” and “cause legal consequences.”  See Parsons, 878 F.3d at 167–68.   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 27 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2653\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 23 (28 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 23 \n \nThe Documents tell the States how to avoid liability, thereby creating legal consequences.  \nTake the Fact Sheet.  After explaining that “[p]ublic elementary and secondary schools, as well \nas public and private colleges and universities, have a responsibility to investigate and address” \ndiscrimination because of a student’s “perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity,” \nit lists “[e]xamples of the kinds of incidents . . . OCR can investigate.”  Fact Sheet, supra.  It \nfurther states that “OCR can also provide information to assist schools in meeting their legal \nobligations.”  Id. (emphasis added).  These examples are not simply enforcement “priorities.”  \nArizona, 40 F.4th at 389.  These examples—as well as the Notice of Interpretation and “Dear \nEducator” Letter—are intended as a basis for the States to “order[] and arrang[e] their affairs.”  \nFrozen Food Express v. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 44 (1956).  Our “pragmatic approach” to \nfinality counsels us to find that these Documents create legal “safe harbors.”  Hawkes, 578 U.S. \nat 598–99; Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 443.   \nSimilarly, the States allege that the Documents force them “either to alter [their] conduct, \nor expose [themselves] to potential liability.”  Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 446 (citation omitted).  \nWe find this persuasive.  For example, Tennessee law provides: “A student’s gender for purposes \nof participation in a public middle school or high school interscholastic athletic activity or event \nmust be determined by the student’s sex at the time of the student’s birth.”  Tenn. Code Ann. \n§ 49-6-310(a).  But the Fact Sheet says that the Department can investigate a situation where “a \ntransgender high school girl [i.e., a biological male] . . . joins her friends to try out for the girls’ \ncheerleading team and the coach turns her away from tryouts solely because she is transgender.”  \nFact Sheet, supra.   \nSo States will risk losing their federal funding if they continue to run their educational \ninstitutions  in  accordance  with  their  own  laws  and  policies.    34  C.F.R.  §§ 100.7(a), \n(d), 100.8(a), (c).  This is a “severe” penalty.  Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 705 \n(1979).  In fact, “[i]n fiscal year 2020-2021, educational programs and activities in Tennessee \nthat are funded through the Tennessee Department of Education are estimated to have received \napproximately $1.5 billion in federal funding.”  R. 1, PageID 5, ¶ 14.  So again, the Documents \nare “the basis for . . . ordering and arranging” the affairs of the States.  Frozen Food, 351 U.S. at \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 28 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2654\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 24 (29 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 24 \n \n44.  This demonstrates that the Documents “determine[]” “rights or obligations.”  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 178. \nBy all accounts, the States’ obligation to investigate claims of sexual orientation and \ngender identity discrimination is new.  The Department doesn’t point to anything that establishes \nthat it had a consistent practice of interpreting Title IX to include these types of injuries.  See \nRhea Lana, Inc. v. Dep’t of Lab., 824 F.3d 1023, 1025, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (explaining that \nthe document at issue in that case “created no new legal obligations” because it merely expressed \na “longstanding view”).  In fact, the Notice of Interpretation admits that “OCR at times has stated \nthat Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination does not encompass discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity.”  Enforcement of Title IX, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32637.  And \nthe  Department  concedes  that  its  “Title  IX  regulations  have  never  directly  addressed  the \napplication  of  Title  IX  to  discrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity.”  \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41390, 41394 (July 12, 2022). \nThe Department disputes the characterization that the Documents amount to final agency \naction.    It  points  to  the  fact  that  the  Notice  of  Interpretation  is  called  just  that—an \n“Interpretation”—and argues that the Notice “does not itself determine the outcome in any \nparticular case or set of facts.”  Appellants Br. at 37.  But the “particular label placed upon [it] is \nnot necessarily conclusive, for it is the substance of what the [agency] has purported to do and \nhas done which is decisive.”  Detroit Edison Co. v. EPA, 496 F.2d 244, 249 (6th Cir. 1974) \n(quoting Columbia Broad. Sys. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 416 (1942)).  As we’ve discussed, \nthe Department binds itself to a view of Title IX and tells the States how to avoid liability under \nthis view, which in turn requires the States to adjust their operations and to immediately broaden \nthe  scope  of  their  own  Title  IX  investigations  or  face  the  consequences.    Because  of  the \nimmediate impact on the States, whether the Documents determine the outcome in any particular \ncase is irrelevant to our inquiry (particularly on pre-enforcement review).  See Frozen Food, 351 \nU.S. at 44; see also Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 599–600 (finding that when an agency has the authority \nto impose legal consequences on a regulated party, its actions can be considered “final” simply \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 29 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2655\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 25 (30 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 25 \n \nby warning regulated parties that, if they engage in certain conduct, “they do so at the risk of \nsignificant criminal and civil penalties”). \nBut, the Department says, the Documents were in effect for a year prior to the district \ncourt’s  injunction.    And  during  that  year,  the  Documents  didn’t  have  an  immediate  and \nsignificant impact on the States because courts did not rely upon or mention the Documents \nduring that year.  Even if that’s true (and without knowing how many suits the Department of \nJustice initiated or was involved in during that year), we don’t think that’s where most of the \n“direct and immediate” impact would be.  The first step on the road to enforcement action is \ninvestigation.  Since the release of the Documents, the Department has opened dozens of gender \ndiscrimination investigations.21   \nLast, the Department’s reliance on Parsons is misplaced.  In Parsons, we found that an \nagency whose only congressionally delegated authority consisted of “collect[ing], analyz[ing], \nand disseminat[ing] gang activity information” and creating an annual report didn’t have the \npower to bind government actors or generate legal consequences.  878 F.3d at 169–70.  The \nDepartment points to this case to say that the Documents would only affect “private citizens \nconsidering whether to bring discrimination complaints.”  Appellants Br. at 39–40.  It is true that \n“harms caused by agency decisions are not legal consequences if they stem from independent \nactions taken by third parties.”  Parsons, 878 F.3d at 168 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But \nhere, the Department bound itself to enforcing Title IX in a new, more demanding manner and \nhas the power to initiate investigations based on alleged Title IX violations.  The Department’s \nnew  position  also  imposes  increased  investigatory  responsibilities  on  Title  IX  recipients \nthemselves,  including  the  States.    If  attempts  to  secure  “voluntary  compliance”  fail,  the \nDepartment “will make a written finding that the recipient is in violation of Title IX,” and it can \n“begin  administrative  proceedings  to  suspend  or  terminate  federal  financial  assistance.”  \nAppellants Br. at 5 (citing 34 C.F.R §§ 100.7(d), 100.8(a)).  While other entities (including some \nprivate parties) have concurrent enforcement authority, the Department can see this process all \n \n21See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Pending Cases Currently Under Investigation at Elementary-Secondary and \nPost-Secondary  Schools  as  of  May,  17  2024  Search,  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs\n/investigations/open-investigations/tix.html.   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 30 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2656\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 26 (31 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 26 \n \nthe way through from investigation to the revocation of funds.  This all makes our circumstances \nsignificantly different from those in Parsons.  In sum, we find that the Documents are final \nagency action.  \nB. \nNext, the Department argues that Title IX provides an adequate alternative remedy such \nthat APA review is not appropriate.  We hold that it does not.   \nEven if agency action is final, “an agency action is reviewable under the APA only if \nthere are no adequate alternatives to APA review in court.”  Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 600 (citing 5 \nU.S.C. § 704).  An alternative remedy must provide “‘relief of the same genre’ to the party \nseeking redress.”  Rimmer v. Holder, 700 F.3d 246, 262 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Garcia v. \nVilsack, 563 F.3d 519, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).  The relevant statute here ensures “that the APA’s \ngeneral grant of jurisdiction to review agency decisions is not duplicative of more specific \nstatutory procedures for judicial review.”  Bangura, 434 F.3d at 501; 5 U.S.C. § 704.  But this \nexception “should not be construed to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad spectrum \nof judicial review of agency action.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 (1988). \nThe Department posits that the States have one alternative to pre-enforcement review \nunder the APA: fail to conform to the Documents and risk an enforcement action (or referral to \nDOJ  for  further  legal  action),  during  which  the  States  can  argue  that  the  Documents  are \nprocedurally flawed and should be set aside.   \nThat’s not adequate.  As the Supreme Court has “long held, parties need not await \nenforcement proceedings before challenging final agency action where such proceedings carry \nthe risk of ‘serious criminal and civil penalties.’”  Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 600 (citing Abbott Labs, \n387 U.S. at 153).  In similar fashion, failing to conform with the Documents puts the States at \nrisk of an often lengthy and arduous investigation and at risk of losing their federal funding \nthrough an enforcement proceeding.  States “need not assume such risks while waiting for [an \nagency] to ‘drop the hammer.’”  Id. at 600 (citing Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 127 (2012)). \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 31 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2657\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 27 (32 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 27 \n \nThe Department responds that the “default rule under the APA is that challenges to \nagency action are raised as defenses in an enforcement action.”  Reply Br. at 16 (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 703).  But the only case it points to in support of this contention—PDR Network, LLC v. \nCarlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019)—is inapposite.  That case looked at \nwhether an aggrieved party may challenge an agency’s interpretation of a statute during an \nenforcement proceeding where a special review act explicitly permitted pre-enforcement review \nof certain regulations.  Id. at 13–15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in the judgment).  Basically, the \nquestion was: Does a regulated party have to raise the argument pursuant to the statute’s pre-\nenforcement  review  provision  or  forever  lose  it?    That  question  isn’t  at  issue  here—the \nDepartment seeks to force the states to wait for review in an enforcement proceeding, not to \npreclude such review.  Nor does the Department argue that Title IX explicitly provides for pre-\nenforcement review of certain regulations, such that general APA review might be precluded.   \nAnd, in any event the Court did not answer the question presented in PDR Network, \ninstead remanding to the court of appeals to answer two antecedent questions.  Id. at 2056 \n(majority opinion).  Still, four Justices concurring in the judgment noted that the “key aim” of its \n“revolution[ary”] decision in Abbott Labs “was to expand the opportunities for judicial review by \nallowing both facial, pre-enforcement challenges and as-applied challenges to agency action.”  \nId. at 2060 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in the judgment).  \nNext, the Department argues that eventual de novo review in a federal court—even if \nonly after adverse administrative action—is an adequate remedy.  But to support that statement, \nit  only  cites  cases  where  a  statute  provided  regulated  parties  with  the  ability  to  initiate \nadministrative proceedings (thereby making administrative review and APA review available \nconcurrently).  See Parke, Davis & Co. v. Califano, 564 F.2d 1200, 1205–06 (6th Cir. 1977); \nGarcia, 563 F.3d at 521, 523.  The Department does not argue that the States have any ability to \ndo that.  And for the reasons we articulated above, the States need not wait for the Department to \nmake the first move.  All said, Title IX doesn’t provide an adequate alternative remedy. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 32 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2658\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 28 (33 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 28 \n \nC. \nOur last reviewability question is whether Title IX precludes pre-enforcement challenges \nto agency action.  We find that it does not. \nAs a general rule, facial pre-enforcement challenges to agency action are permissible \nabsent statutory preclusion of such review.  Abbott Labs, 387 U.S. at 139–41.  Congress may \nforeclose such review “explicitly” or “implicitly, by specifying a different method to resolve \nclaims about agency action.”  Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 185 (2023).  So our \nprimary inquiry is to ask if the statutory scheme displays a “fairly discernible” intent to limit \njurisdiction.  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 216 (1994). \nThe Department does not argue that Title IX explicitly specifies a way to resolve the \nStates’ suit.  By all accounts, Title IX is silent regarding pre-enforcement challenges.  So we \nlook to whether Title IX implicitly precludes the States from bringing an APA pre-enforcement \nchallenge.  We find that it does not. \n“Title IX contains no comprehensive enforcement scheme.”  Lillard v. Shelby Cnty. Bd. \nOf Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 723 (6th Cir. 1996).  “The statute’s only express enforcement mechanism, \n[20 U.S.C.] § 1682, is an administrative procedure resulting in the withdrawal of federal funding \nfrom institutions that are not in compliance.”  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 555 U.S. \n246, 255 (2009).  And the Court has previously recognized a private right of action.  See \nCannon, 441 U.S. 677.22  “These remedies—withdrawal of federal funds and an implied cause of \naction—stand in  stark contrast  to  the unusually elaborate, carefully tailored, and restrictive \nenforcement schemes of” other statutes that have been held to impliedly preclude other statutory \nremedies.  Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 255 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n   \n \n22We note that Cannon has been questioned and criticized, see, e.g., Franklin, 503 U.S. at 77–78 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring) (explaining that courts “have abandoned the expansive rights-creating approach exemplified by \nCannon, and perhaps ought to abandon the notion of implied causes of action entirely” (citations omitted)), but it \nremains good law.  \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 33 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2659\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 29 (34 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 29 \n \nThis brings us to Title IX’s judicial review provision.  As we must, we start with the text: \nAny department or agency action taken pursuant to section 1682 of this title shall \nbe subject to such judicial review as may otherwise be provided by law for similar \naction taken by such department or agency on other grounds.  In the case of \naction, not otherwise subject to judicial review, terminating or refusing to grant or \nto continue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any \nrequirement imposed pursuant to section 1682 of this title, any person aggrieved \n(including any State or political subdivision thereof and any agency of either) may \nobtain judicial review of such action in accordance with chapter 7 of Title 5, and \nsuch action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion \nwithin the meaning of section 701 of that title. \n20 U.S.C. § 1683.  Looking at the plain text, it’s clear that there is more than one path to some \ntype of judicial review.  The second sentence of § 1683, which provides one avenue to judicial \nreview,  says  that  after  an  administrative  enforcement  proceeding  strips  the  recipient  of  its \nfunding, the recipient can sue under the APA.  Id.   \nThe Department argues that this provision bars judicial review of enforcement actions \nuntil the enforcement proceeding is complete.  But the text of that provision conflicts with the \nDepartment’s position because it’s phrased in permissive terms.  It says that those aggrieved by \nan enforcement proceeding “may” sue under the APA.  But it doesn’t say that anyone “shall” or \n“shall not” do anything.  And courts have explained in a similar context that it would be \n“troublingly  counterintuitive  to  interpret  [a  statute’s]  permissive  language  as  eliminating \nalternative routes to federal court review.”  Cochran v. SEC, 20 F.4th 194, 201 (5th Cir. 2021), \naff’d and remanded sub nom. Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175 (2023); see Dorris v. \nAbsher, 179 F.3d 420, 429 (6th Cir. 1999) (“The use of the term ‘may’ in a statute is generally \nconstrued as permissive rather than as mandatory.”).23   \nContrast the second provision’s permissive language with the mandatory language of the \nfirst provision of § 1683, which says that agency action taken pursuant to § 1682 “shall be \nsubject to such judicial review as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by \n \n23This provision also says APA review is possible for any other action “not otherwise subject to judicial \nreview.”  20 U.S.C. § 1683.  The Department does not explain what “not otherwise subject to judicial review” refers \nto, nor does it argue that it has any particular significance.  It might be a poorly drafted savings clause.  We leave \nthis for another day. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 34 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2660\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 30 (35 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 30 \n \nsuch department  or agency on other grounds.”  20  U.S.C.  § 1683 (emphases added).   Put \ndifferently, the availability of judicial review is dictated by the type of agency action, and § 1683 \ndoesn’t provide an independent bar to review.  For example, some courts interpreting an identical \njudicial review provision in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 196424 say that the phrase “as \nmay otherwise be provided by law for similar action” can refer to 20 U.S.C. § 1234g.25  See, e.g., \nFreeman v. Cavazos, 923 F.2d 1434, 1440 (11th Cir. 1991) (finding that 20 U.S.C. § 1234g is \n“the appropriate judicial review provision[] for the termination order in” a case concerning \n“agency  action  terminating  federal  funding”).    Another  “provision  in  law,  as  specifically \nidentified in the legislative history of [the Civil Rights] Act” is § 702 of the APA.  Adams v. Bell, \n711 F.2d 161, 182 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Wright, J., dissenting); Marlow v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \n820 F.2d 581, 582 (2d Cir. 1987).  All of this suggests to us that § 1683 alone doesn’t bar judicial \nreview.   \nBut even if Congress intended § 1683 to strip jurisdiction over some claims, we find that \nthe States’ claim is not the type that Congress intended to funnel through § 1683.  See Axon, 598 \nU.S. at 188–89.  Thunder Basin provides three considerations to guide our analysis here.  510 \nU.S.  at  212–13.26    First,  we  ask:  Will  precluding  federal  court  jurisdiction  “foreclose  all \nmeaningful judicial review” of the claim?  Id.  Next, we ask: Is the claim “wholly collateral to \n[the] statute’s review provisions?”  Id. at 212 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Finally, we \n \n24Because “Title IX was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” and because “[b]oth \nstatutes provide  the  same  administrative  mechanism  for  terminating  federal financial  support  for  institutions \nengaged in prohibited discrimination,” we look to interpretations of Title VI’s judicial review provision to guide our \ndiscussion here.  See Cannon, 441 U.S. at 694–96; see also Fitzgerald, 555 U.S. at 258 (Congress “passed Title IX \nwith the explicit understanding that it would be interpreted as Title VI was.”); compare 20 U.S.C. § 1683, with \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2.   \n2520 U.S.C. § 1234g provides for judicial review in the court of appeals of three types of adverse actions: \n(1) an agency determines that a funding recipient “made an expenditure of funds that is not allowable under [a] grant \nor cooperative agreement” (§ 1234a); (2) an agency withholds funds from a recipient after finding that it failed to \ncomply with a requirement that applies to it (§ 1234d); or (3) an agency issues a cease and desist order (§ 1234e).  \nNotably, 20 U.S.C. § 1234g doesn’t mention review of compliance agreements (§ 1234f)—the most frequent form \nof agency action in this space.  This is because, once the Department commences an investigation, it is statutorily \nrequired to seek voluntary compliance at almost every step of the process.  20 U.S.C. § 1682; see also 34 C.F.R. \n§ 100.7(d). \n26We acknowledge that important questions have been raised in the debate over the extent to which the \nThunder Basin factors are even needed for our inquiry.  See Axon, 598 U.S. at 205–17 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in \nthe judgment) (criticizing Thunder Basin and instead looking to the text of 28 U.S.C. § 1331 to answer jurisdictional \nquestions).  But we do not take up those concerns here.  \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 35 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2661\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 31 (36 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 31 \n \nask: Is the claim “outside the agency’s expertise?”  Id.  “When the answer to all three questions \nis  yes,  ‘we  presume  that  Congress  does  not  intend  to  limit  [federal  court]  jurisdiction.’”  \nAxon, 598 U.S. at 186 (quoting Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, \n489 (2010)).  “[T]he same conclusion might follow if the factors point in different directions,” \nhowever, because the “ultimate question is how best to understand what Congress has done—\nwhether the statutory review scheme, though exclusive where it applies, reaches the claim in \nquestion.”  Id.27 \nNaturally, we start with the first consideration—whether prohibiting this pre-enforcement \naction would “foreclose all meaningful judicial review of the claim.”  Id. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  As the Department reads § 1683, the States must lose their federal funding \nthrough  an  enforcement  proceeding  before  bringing  any  claims  to  federal  court.    But  the \nmechanics  of  how  the  Department  and  OCR  (its  litigation  division)  carry  out  its  mandate \nsuggests that their proposal would foreclose all meaningful judicial review of the States’ claims.  \nThis is because “not once has the OCR ever cut off funds to enforce Title IX.”  R. Shep \nMelnick, The Strange Evolution of Title IX, National Affairs, (Summer 2018).  Instead, matters \nare resolved “informal[ly].”  34 C.F.R. § 100.7(d)(1).  To illustrate the point, consider the \nfollowing  scenario.    The  Department  initiates  an  investigation  against  a  Tennessee  school \ndistrict, where state law requires that participation in athletic activities at public middle schools \n \n27We also note that this case differs from Thunder Basin itself in various ways.  First, the Court in Thunder \nBasin concluded that the statute’s “comprehensive enforcement structure, combined with the legislative history’s \nclear concern with channeling and streamlining the enforcement process, establishes a fairly discernible intent to \npreclude district court review.”  510 U.S. at 216 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, on the other hand, the \ntext of § 1683 does not come close to establishing a “comprehensive enforcement structure.”  Second, Thunder \nBasin addressed a situation in which two inspectors were appointed representatives of the agency to inspect the mine \nfor compliance with the statute.  Id. at 203.  After complaining to the agency that the appointment of these \nrepresentatives  violated  the  company’s  statutory  rights  and  refusing  to  provide  the  inspectors  with  required \ninformation, the company then filed suit in federal court.  Id. at 205; see also Axon, 598 U.S. at 186–87.  Though the \nmining company in Thunder Basin “sued before a citation was issued,” 510 U.S. at 216, agency action had begun in \nother ways.  Namely, the agency had already taken action when it appointed two representatives to inspect the mine \nand demanded they be provided with particular information.  See id.; see also Elgin v. Dep’t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, \n7–8 (2012) (holding that plaintiff must first go through administrative review process because the plaintiff was \nbrought before an ALJ, which counted as agency action, prior to plaintiff filing case in federal court).  So in Thunder \nBasin and Elgin, it made sense to insist that the parties go through the statutorily prescribed agency review process \nrather than take a short cut to federal court.  Here, no similar circumstances exist that would make it more efficient \nfor the States to first go through the administrative adjudication process.  To the contrary, a process that requires \nadministrative review first and judicial review second would prove costly and dilatory for all parties involved. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 36 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2662\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 32 (37 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 32 \n \nand high schools “must be determined by the student’s sex at the time of the student’s birth.”  \nTenn. Code Ann. § 49-6-310(a).  A lengthy investigation ensues.  The Department finds that a \nTennessee school district is out of compliance and then seeks voluntary compliance, as it must \nbefore it goes any further.  20 U.S.C. § 1682.  Both parties are incentivized (one by statute and \nregulation, the other by practical realities, costs, and the threat of enforcement action) to resolve \nthe matter informally.  In fact, these matters “will be resolved by informal means whenever \npossible.”  See 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(d)(1).   \nThe point is that investigations, informal coercion, and compliance agreements are where \nTitle IX is “litigated.”  And the Department doesn’t contend that matters resolved “informally” \nare subject to any sort of judicial review.  Cf. Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 130–31 (2012) \n(“There is no reason to think that the Clean Water Act was uniquely designed to enable the \nstrong-arming  of  regulated  parties  into  ‘voluntary  compliance’  without  the  opportunity  for \njudicial review.”). \nEven  so,  the  Department  in  effect  proposes  that  the  States  invite  enforcement \nproceedings—and risk the loss of federal funding—perhaps by ignoring requests to examine \ntheir  records,  policies,  and  procedures  during  an  investigation  or  compliance  review,  or \nnegotiating in bad faith.  But “we normally do not require plaintiffs to bet the farm by taking the \nviolative action before testing the validity of the law.”  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 490 \n(cleaned up).   \nSimply put, this isn’t a case where the States “can be injured” from the Documents “only \nin the course of being the subject of an enforcement proceeding.”  Polyweave Packaging, Inc. v. \nButtigieg, 51 F.4th 675, 683 (6th Cir. 2022).  This is a “here-and-now injury” where the States’ \ninjury as alleged has immediate effects on the States’ ordering of their own affairs.  Axon, 598 \nU.S. at 191; see also Romeo Cmty. Schs. v. U.S. Dept. of Health, Educ., and Welfare, 438 F. \nSupp. 1021, 1028 (E.D. Mich. 1977).  And the upshot of winning this claim is that the States \nshouldn’t be subjected to administrative investigations or proceedings at all.  A later court-of-\nappeals decision could not fully remedy that harm.  See Axon, 598 U.S. at 194. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 37 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2663\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 33 (38 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 33 \n \nThat brings us to the second question—are the States’ claims wholly collateral?  The \nanswer:  Yes,  for  similar  reasons  to  those  just articulated.    Important  here,  the  “collateral” \ninquiry, as “Free Enterprise Fund recognized, requires considering the nature of the claim, not \nthe status (pending or not) of an agency proceeding.”  Axon, 598 U.S. at 194.  The States “are \nchallenging the [Department’s] power to proceed at all, rather than actions taken in the agency \nproceedings.”  Id. at 192; see Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 614 (1984); Fed. L. Enf’t Officers \nAss’n v. Ahuja, 62 F.4th 551, 564 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  At bottom, the States are seeking notice and \nan opportunity to comment.  If the States’ notice-and-comment claim succeeds, the agency \naction must be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.28  All other claims the States include in their \ncomplaint are alternatives if their notice-and-comment claim fails (and the Department explicitly \nasks us not to consider them).   \nAnd finally, this claim is “outside the [Department’s] expertise.”  Thunder Basin, 510 \nU.S. at 212.  The States raise a “standard question[] of administrative law”—whether notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking was required—a question wholly separate from “technical considerations \nof agency policy.”  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491 (quoting Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. \n361, 373 (1974); Axon, 598 U.S. at 194.  Moreover, the Department puts forth no evidence of its \nexpertise in administrative law.  Though the Department “knows a good deal about [education] \npolicy,” it is “ill suited to address” complicated administrative law questions.  Axon, 598 U.S. at \n194–95. \nTo sum it up, the States’ claims are reviewable.  We are reviewing final agency action \nwhere there is no other adequate remedy at law, and Title IX does not preclude this APA pre-\nenforcement suit. \n \n28Our cases demonstrate that this is our ordinary remedial practice in successful notice-and-comment \nchallenges.  E.g., Mann Constr., Inc. v. United States, 27 F.4th 1138, 1148 (6th Cir. 2022) (“Because the IRS’s \n[challenged Notice] did not satisfy the notice-and-comment procedures for promulgating legislative rules under the \nAPA, we must set it aside.”).  We recognize the question regarding whether the APA’s “set aside” provision \nauthorizes a federal court to order universal vacatur of agency action.  See, e.g., United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. at \n693–703 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  But we have no occasion to take up that question here. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 38 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2664\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 34 (39 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 34 \n \nIV. \nWe  must  now  decide  whether  the  district  court  properly  granted  the  preliminary \ninjunction.    In  deciding  whether  to  grant  a  preliminary  injunction,  we  ask  the  following \nquestions:  (1)  Has  the  plaintiff  established  “that  he  is  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits?”  \n(2) Would the plaintiff likely “suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief?”  \n(3) Does the “balance of equities tip[] in his favor?”  And (4) does “the public interest” favor an \ninjunction?  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  “We review the \ndistrict  court’s  ultimate  decision  whether  to  grant  a  preliminary  injunction  for  abuse  of \ndiscretion, and we evaluate its legal determinations, including the likelihood of success on the \nmerits, with fresh eyes,” i.e., de novo.  Arizona, 40 F.4th at 381 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nA. \nWe start with the first question.  Are the States likely to succeed on their claim that the \nissuance of the Documents violated the APA?  We think so.  \nThe APA divides agency action, as relevant here, into three boxes: legislative rules, \ninterpretive rules, and general statements of policy.  This distinction matters.  Legislative rules \nhave the force and effect of law and are subject to notice and comment.  That means that an \nagency must publish a notice about the proposed rule, allow the public to comment on the rule, \nconsider the comments, and issue a final rule setting forth the basis and purpose of the rule.  See \n5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c).  These procedural requirements do not apply to interpretive rules or \ngeneral statements of policy.  See id. § 553(b)(A).   \nThe Documents did not go through notice and comment.  So if the Documents are \nlegislative rules, the Department has not exercised its authority in a procedurally proper way, and \na court must set aside the Documents.  Id. § 706(2)(D).29  This means that we must determine the \nnature of the Department’s action: Is it a legislative rule?  Or an interpretive rule?30 \n \n29We note that beyond the procedural requirements of the APA, the Department’s own interim final \nregulations required a period of public notice and comment for “[s]ignificant guidance documents”—guidance \ndocuments “that may reasonably be anticipated to” “[r]aise novel, legal, or policy issues arising out of legal \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 39 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2665\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 35 (40 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 35 \n \nThis inquiry is familiar but abstruse.  “Interpretive rule” is not defined by the APA, “and \nits precise meaning is the source of much scholarly and judicial debate.”  Perez v. Mortg. \nBankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).  We do know that “the critical feature of interpretive \nrules is that they are ‘issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s construction of the \nstatutes and rules which it administers.’”  Id. at 97 (quoting Shalala v. Guernsey Mem’l Hosp., \n514 U.S. 87, 99 (1995)).  Interpretive rules “clarify a statutory or regulatory term, remind parties \nof existing statutory or regulatory duties, or merely track preexisting requirements and explain \nsomething the statute or regulation already required.”  Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1021 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014) (cleaned up).  In short, they do not have the force and effect of law.   \nLegislative rules, on the other hand, do.  They “impose new rights or duties and change \nthe legal status of regulated parties.”  Mann Constr., Inc. v. United States, 27 F.4th 1138, 1143 \n(6th Cir. 2022).  We ask: Does the new rule “effect[] a substantive regulatory change to the \nstatutory or regulatory regime?”  Mendoza, 754 F.3d at 1021 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAnd “[w]hen rulemaking carries out an express delegation of authority from Congress to an \nagency, it usually leads to legislative rules.” Mann Constr., 27 F.4th at 1143.  Distinguishing \nbetween legislative and interpretive rules is an “extraordinarily case-specific endeavor.”  Am. \nHosp. Ass’n v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1987). \nFor  at  least  three  reasons,  the  States  are  likely  to  succeed  on  their  claim  that  the \nDocuments amount to a legislative rule and therefore must be set aside.   \n \nmandates.”  Rulemaking and Guidance Procedures, 85 Fed. Reg. 62597-01, 62608 (effective Nov. 4, 2020).  The \nDepartment  rescinded  those  interim  final  regulations  effective  September  29,  2021,  but  that  was  after  the \nDepartment issued the Documents challenged in this case.  Rulemaking and Guidance Procedures, 86 Fed. Reg. \n53863-02.  The States do not raise this point, however, so we don’t address it further. \n30Recall that we determined that the Documents are binding on the Department because it withdrew its \npreviously held discretion to enforce Title IX consistent with a view that its anti-discrimination mandate does not \ninclude sexual orientation and gender identity.  This means the Documents cannot amount to a policy statement \nbecause statements of policy are, “issued by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the \nagency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 197 (1993) (emphasis added \nand internal quotation marks omitted); see Flight Training Int’l, Inc. v. FAA, 58 F.4th 234, 242 (5th Cir. 2023); Am. \nMining Cong. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1111 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (explaining that the inquiry of \nwhether a rule “restrict[s] agency discretion” is helpful in determining whether a rule is interpretive or a policy \nstatement, but “restricting discretion tells one little about whether a rule is interpretive”).  So here we will determine \nwhether the Documents are an interpretive rule or a legislative rule. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 40 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2666\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 36 (41 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 36 \n \nFirst, the Documents carry out an express delegation of authority from Congress.  The \nlaw at issue tells education institutions that “[n]o person . . . shall, on the basis of sex . . . be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  And the Department is “authorized and directed to effectuate \nthe provisions of section 1681 of this title with respect to such program or activity by issuing \nrules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.”  Id. § 1682. \nThe  “express  statutory  means  of  enforcement”  of  this  general  prohibition  “is \nadministrative.”  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 280 (1998).  “The statute \ndirects federal agencies that distribute education funding to establish requirements to effectuate \nthe nondiscrimination mandate.”  Id. (citing § 1682).  And “[w]hen rulemaking carries out an \nexpress delegation of authority from Congress to an agency, it usually leads to legislative rules.”  \nMann Constr., 27 F.4th at 1143; see Mendoza, 754 F.3d at 1021 (finding a rule is legislative \nwhen the statutory language “establishes the [Act’s] general mission; Congress left it to the \n[agency] to implement that mission through the creation of specific substantive provisions”). \nThat brings us to our second point: the Documents impose new duties on the States.  Put \nanother way, “the disputed rule really adds content to the governing legal norms.”  Syncor Int’l \nCorp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 96 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  “Because Congress did not list any specific \ndiscriminatory practices when it wrote Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice does not \ntell us anything about whether it intended that practice to be covered.”  Jackson, 544 U.S. at 175.  \nAnd here, the Department says: “Public elementary and secondary schools, as well as \npublic and private colleges and universities, have a responsibility to investigate and address sex \ndiscrimination, including sexual harassment, against students because of their perceived or actual \nsexual orientation or gender identity.”  Fact Sheet, supra (emphasis added).  “When schools fail \nto  respond  appropriately, [the Department] can help  by  enforcing  federal  laws that protect \nstudents from discrimination. . . .  OCR can also provide information to assist schools in meeting \ntheir legal obligations.”  Id. (emphasis added). \nPrior  to  the  Documents,  the  States  had  no  obligation  to  investigate  these  claims.  \nAccording to the Department, they now do.  And, the States say, this in turn obligates them to \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 41 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2667\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 37 (42 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 37 \n \nstop the enforcement of their own contrary laws and policies.  Failure to comply comes with the \nrisk of penalties, i.e., loss of funding, 20 U.S.C. § 1682, which is “characteristic[] of legislative \nrules,” Mann Constr., 27 F.4th at 1143.  In short, by changing the means of compliance with \nTitle IX, the Documents affected the stringency of Title IX itself.  The Documents extend Title \nIX’s  protections  to  new  forms  of  sex  discrimination,  obligating  the  States  to  act  or  face \nrepercussions.   \nThe third reason that the Documents are likely legislative pertains specifically to the Fact \nSheet.  As we’ve mentioned, the Fact Sheet lists five types of investigations Education can \ninitiate in accordance with the Documents.  One scenario includes: \nOn her way to the girls’ restroom, a transgender high school girl is stopped by the \nprincipal who bars her entry.  The principal tells the student to use the boys’ \nrestroom or nurse’s office because her school records identify her as “male.”  \nLater, the student joins her friends to try out for the girls’ cheerleading team and \nthe coach turns her away from tryouts solely because she is transgender.  When \nthe student complains, the principal tells her “those are the district’s policies.” \nFact Sheet, supra.  This conflicts with the Department’s current regulations on access to school \nfacilities and athletics programs, which, on our read, permit schools to issue rules and policies in \naccordance with one’s biological sex without accommodating gender identity.  The relevant \nregulation says: “A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such \nfacilities provided for students of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (emphases added).  And “a \nrecipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for \nsuch teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.”  Id. \n§ 106.41(b) (emphasis added).   \nWithout  deciding  any  substantive  merits  questions,  and  applying  any  number  of \ninterpretive canons, we can all agree that phrases such as “one sex,” “the other sex,” and “each \nsex” could refer to biological sex.  See, e.g., Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 69, 78, 170 (2012) (describing the ordinary-meaning canon, \nfixed-meaning canon, and presumption of consistent usage canon, respectively).  And, at times, \nthis has been the Department’s position.  See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 42 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2668\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 38 (43 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 38 \n \nPrograms or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30026, 30178 (May \n19, 2020). (“Title IX and its implementing regulations include provisions that presuppose sex as \na binary classification, and provisions in the Department’s current regulations . . . reflect this \npresupposition.”).   \n“Because interpretive rules cannot effect a substantive change in the regulations, a rule \nthat  adopts  a  new  position  inconsistent  with  any  of  the  [agency’s]  existing  regulations  is \nnecessarily legislative.”   Tenn.  Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 908  F.3d 1029,  1042 (6th Cir. 2018) \n(cleaned up).31  Basically, the regulations permit, but do not require, aid recipients to organize \ntheir athletics programs and facilities by biological sex.  Schools could, for example, choose \ncoeducational  teams  and  facilities.    It  follows  that  they  could  also  separate  programs  and \nfacilities by gender identity. No one disputes that athletics programs solely used biological sex as \na classification method for decades—an approach authorized by existing Title IX regulations.  \nSee 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b).  Yet the Fact Sheet makes clear that aid recipients must not organize \ntheir athletics programs and facilities exclusively by biological sex.  Fact Sheet, supra (noting \nthat the Department can initiate an investigation if “the district’s policies” do not allow for a \nbiological male “to try out for the girls’ cheerleading team” or enter “the girls’ restroom”).  \nHaving  permitted  funding  recipients  to  organize  their  athletics  programs  and  facilities \nexclusively by biological sex, the Department cannot now narrow the regulation’s classification \nmethods through an interpretive rule.  See Tenn Hosp., 908 F.3d at 1043; Flight Training, \n58 F.4th at 244 (finding that a rule is legislative where it requires less than the regulations \ncurrently in place); see generally Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th \n791, 807 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (noting differences between gender identity and biological \nsex). \n \n31This finding is not in conflict with Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association, which dealt specifically with \nthe now-defunct Paralyzed-Veterans doctrine.  575 U.S. at 95 (holding that Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D.C. \nArena L.P., 117 F.3d 579 (D.C. Cir. 1997), is not consistent with the APA).  That doctrine involved a different \nquestion:  When  an  agency  changes  its  interpretation  of  one  of  the  regulations  that  it  enforces,  does  that \ninterpretation need to go through notice and comment?  Id. at 102.  Perez said no.  Id.  Put another way, when an \nagency has issued an interpretive rule on a regulation and then a different interpretive rule later, the second \ninterpretation doesn’t need to go through notice and comment solely because it conflicts with the first one.  See id. at \n101 (“Because an agency is not required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it \nis also not required to use those procedures when it amends or repeals that interpretive rule.”). \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 43 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2669\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 39 (44 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.

Hosp., 908 F.3d at 1045.  Shortly before the district court issued a preliminary injunction \nin  this  case,  the  Department  issued  a  proposed  rule  that,  among  other  things,  codifies: \n“Discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex \ncharacteristics,  pregnancy  or  related  conditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender  identity.”  \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education, 87 Fed. Reg. at 41571.  And last year, it \nreleased a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking claiming sexual orientation and gender identity fit \nwithin the Title IX scheme in the athletics space.  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \nEducation  Programs  or  Activities  Receiving  Federal  Financial  Assistance:  Sex-Related \nEligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams, 88 Fed. Reg. 22860 (April 13, 2023).  \nThe Department proposes to prevent categorical bans on transgender athletes participating on \nsports teams in alignment with their gender identities.  See id.; U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Fact Sheet: \nU.S. Department  of  Education’s  Proposed  Change  to  its  Title  IX  Regulations  on  Students’ \nEligibility for Athletic Teams (April 6, 2023), https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet\n-us-department-educations-proposed-change-its-title-ix-regulations-students-eligibility-athletic-\nteams.  This  move  on  behalf  of  the  Department  “weigh[s]  in  favor”  of  finding  that  the \ninterpretation is legislative.  Tenn. Hosp., 908 F.3d at 1045.   \nIn response to all this, the Department asserts that the Documents simply represent its \n“understanding of the longstanding sex discrimination prohibitions contained in [Title IX] and \nare merely intended to advise the public of the agency’s construction of the statutes and rules \nwhich  it  administers.”    Appellants  Br.  at  49  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    But  the \nDepartment doesn’t provide any support for the position that its understanding of Title IX is \n“longstanding.”    And  it  can’t  be  that  the  Documents  “convey[]”  the  Department’s \n“understanding”  that  discrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity  “have \nalways been” prohibited forms of sex discrimination under Title IX.  Guedes v. ATF, 920 F.3d 1, \n19 (D.C. Cir. 2019).   \nTo our understanding, the first time the Department articulated a stance like the one \nexpressed in the Documents was in 2016.  Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX and Transgender \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 44 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2670\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 40 (45 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 40 \n \nStudents (May 13, 2016) (rescinded in 2017).  Even if the Department had maintained consistent \nviews on the issue since 2016, we’re skeptical that a position held for that amount of time would \nbe considered “longstanding.”  Rhea Lana, 824 F.3d at 1028; see id. at 1025 (“The Department \nof Labor has for several decades read the Fair Labor Standards Act to prohibit for-profit, private-\nsector  entities  from  using  volunteer  workers.”).    And,  in  any  event,  the  view  hasn’t  been \nconsistent.  See Gen. Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.2d 1561, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(relying on the fact that a rule “simply restated the consistent practice of the agency”); see, e.g., \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education (2020), 85 Fed. Reg. at 30178 (“Title IX and \nits implementing regulations include provisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification, \nand provisions in the Department’s current regulations . . . reflect this presupposition.”); Sexual \nHarassment Guidance, 62 Fed. Reg. at 12039 (“Title IX does not prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation.”).  It can’t be that sexual orientation and gender identity have always \nbeen protected given the clear evidence of prior contrary agency positions.   \nWhat’s more, the position that Title IX has always prohibited discrimination on the basis \nof sexual orientation and gender identity conflicts with the Department’s view espoused in the \nDocuments.  The Documents purport “to clarify the Department’s enforcement authority . . . in \nlight of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock,” published just a few years ago.  Enforcement \nof Title IX, 86 Fed. Reg. at 32637.  In other words, according to the Department, Bostock \nprovided the legal grounding to extend an interpretation of a similar phrase in Title VII to Title \nIX.32  According to the Department, however, it can proceed to enforce its view of Title IX in the \nabsence of the Documents, and this suggests the Documents are merely interpretive.  Title IX, \nthe Department says, would be the basis for any enforcement action, not the Documents. \nTwo responses.  First, the Department seems to suggest that it exercised enforcement \ndiscretion by not asserting authority over the States in the past and is therefore simply reversing \nthat discretionary decision.  But that is just another way of saying that the Documents amount to \na mere policy statement.  We’ve already determined that the Documents aren’t policy statements \nbecause they bind the Department to a position that the States have an obligation to investigate \n \n32To be clear, today we are not speaking to the validity of any arguments, raised below and on which the \ndistrict court did not opine, that the Documents violate the Spending Clause.  See, e.g., Jackson, 544 U.S. at 181–84. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 45 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2671\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 41 (46 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 41 \n \nsexual  orientation  and  gender  identity  discrimination  claims  and  to  provide  certain \naccommodations—all because Title IX now prohibits discrimination on the basis of such traits.  \nSee Syncor, 127 F.3d at 96.   \nSecond, if this were all it took, we wouldn’t have cases like Mann Construction.  There, a \nstatutory provision permitted the IRS to penalize the failure to provide information concerning \n“listed transactions.”  27 F.4th at 1142.  The IRS issued a notice that “designate[d] certain \nemployee-benefit plans . . . as listed transactions.”  Id.  After the IRS enforced its rule against a \ntaxpayer, it too could have said that, in some sense, the statute, not the notice was the authority \nfor  the  enforcement  action.    Yet  we  found  that  the  notice  was  a  legislative  rule  that  had \nimpermissibly “skipp[ed] the notice-and-comment process.”  Id. at 1141.  So we don’t find this \nargument convincing. \nOne final note.  Recognizing new forms of discrimination “substantially changes the \nexperience” for all regulated entities, in terms of how to carry out their obligations, and for all \nthe beneficiaries of Title IX—including biological women.  See Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. DHS, \n653 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  It seems to us that such “sweeping policy initiatives” are not \nwhat courts have in mind when they say that “agencies need not address every conceivable \nquestion that could  arise in  a regulatory scheme through notice-and-comment  rulemaking.”  \nTenn. Hosp., 908 F.3d at 1046 (internal quotation marks omitted).33  \nFor these reasons, we believe the States are likely to succeed in their claim that the \nDocuments amount to a legislative rule and therefore should be set aside. \n \n33Taking a step back and considering our Constitution’s first principles, it becomes clear why sweeping \nnew rules promulgated under the language of “discrimination on the basis of sex” are properly considered legislative \nrather than interpretive.  The Founders understood legislative power to be the ability to promulgate generally \napplicable rules governing private conduct.  See Dep’t of Transp. v. Ass’n of Am. R.Rs., 575 U.S. 43, 70 (2015) \n(Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment) (“Under the original understanding of the Constitution,” the “formulation \nof generally applicable rules of private conduct” “requires the exercise of legislative power.”); Gundy v. United \nStates, 588 U.S. 128, 153 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (“When it came to the legislative power, the framers \nunderstood it to mean the power to adopt generally applicable rules of conduct governing future actions by private \npersons.”); see West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 738 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (“The framers believed that the power to \nmake new laws regulating private conduct was a grave one that could, if not properly checked, pose a serious threat \nto individual liberty.”).  When agencies create new rules that bear on private individuals’ and entities’ legal rights \nand obligations, therefore, they are exercising a power that is unquestionably legislative by nature. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 46 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2672\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 42 (47 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 42 \n \nB. \nWe next ask whether the States are “likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief.”  Platt v. Bd. of Comm’rs on Grievances & Discipline, 769 F.3d 447, 453 (6th \nCir. 2014).  They are.  Absent an injunction, the States will be forced to comply with the \nDepartment’s new regulations, contrary to their own policies.  And they are “likely to incur \nunrecoverable compliance costs in the absence of a preliminary injunction,” and the federal \ngovernment’s “sovereign immunity typically makes” such losses irreparable.  Kentucky v. Biden, \n57 F.4th 545, 556 (6th Cir. 2023).  Moreover, the States with conflicting laws will be hampered \nin their ability to enforce their laws, and the States will continue to face pressure to change their \nlaws to avoid legal consequences.  See Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 602 n.17 (2018) (“[T]he \ninability  to  enforce  its duly  enacted  plans  clearly  inflicts  irreparable  harm  on  the  State.”); \nThompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 619 (6th Cir. 2020) (“Any time a State is enjoined by a \ncourt from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of \nirreparable injury.” (quoting Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012))).  “[I]nvasions of \nstate sovereignty . . . likely cannot be economically quantified, and thus cannot be monetarily \nredressed,” and as such constitute irreparable harm.  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th at 611 n.19.  \nThus, the second factor favors a preliminary injunction. \nC. \n  The last two factors—the harm to the opposing party and the public’s interest—“merge” \nbecause the “Government is the opposing party” in this case.  Wilson v. Williams, 961 F.3d 829, \n844 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  On the one hand, a \npreliminary  injunction  would  prevent  the  Department  from  fully  enforcing  the  Documents, \nwhich, on the Department’s view, properly implement Title IX.  But “the public’s true interest \nlies in the correct application of the law.”  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th at 612 (emphasis added).  \nAnd here, the States have shown that the Documents are likely procedurally invalid.  As a result, \nall factors support the issuance of a preliminary injunction. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 47 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2673\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 43 (48 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 43 \n \nD. \nIn response, the Department argues that even if all four factors support a preliminary \ninjunction, the injunction is too broad.  Not so.   \nTo be sure, “federal courts should not issue relief that extends further than necessary to \nremedy” plaintiffs’ injuries.  Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F.4th at 556–57.  In similar pre-enforcement \nchallenges to federal regulations, we have expressed concern over “nationwide injunctions,” \nwhich “seem to take the judicial power beyond its traditionally understood uses” by “permitting \ndistrict courts to order the government to act or refrain from acting toward nonparties.”  Arizona \nv. Biden, 31 F.4th at 483–84 (Sutton, C.J., concurring).  And we have indicated that even \n“geographically limited” injunctions extending to non-parties raise “substantial questions about \nfederal courts’ constitutional and equitable powers.”  Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F.4th at 556–57. \nBut rather than granting a nationwide injunction, the district court here issued relief \nlimited  to  only  the  Plaintiff  States.    And  each  of  the  twenty  plaintiff  states  has  shown  a \nsubstantial likelihood that it has standing under both a proprietary and a procedural-rights theory, \nas explained above.  So the preliminary injunction is “no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary” to prevent the irreparable harm identified.  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \n(1979); see also Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F. 4th at 557. \nNonetheless, the Department claims that the district court abused its discretion because, \nfor some states, the law of the relevant circuit indicates that discrimination based on gender \nidentity or sexual orientation is unlawful sex discrimination.  But the cases that the Department \nsays conflict with the preliminary injunction don’t.  Some deal exclusively with Title VII, not \nTitle IX, even before Bostock.  EEOC v. R.G. &. G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., 884 F.3d 560 \n(6th Cir. 2018), aff’d sub nom. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 683; Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566 \n(6th Cir. 2004).  Another does not answer the merits question because it was in an early stage of \nlitigation.  Dodds v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 845 F.3d 217, 221–22 (6th Cir. 2016) (not determining \nthe  merits  of  the  issue  presented).    Most  importantly,  none  deal  with  the  Department’s \nDocuments here.  See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 619 (4th Cir. 2020) \n(“[A]pplication of [a] restroom policy against [a student with gender dysphoria] violated Title \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 48 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2674\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 44 (49 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 44 \n \nIX.”); Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1050 (7th Cir. \n2017) (finding a probability of success on the merits of a gender identity Title IX claim), \nabrogated on other grounds by Ill. Republican Party v. Pritzker, 973 F.3d 760 (7th Cir. 2020).   \nYes, courts ordinarily should “not award injunctive relief that would cause substantial \ninterference with another court’s sovereignty.”  United States v. AMC Ent., Inc., 549 F.3d 760, \n770 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 289 (1952)).  But here, as \nthe States point out, “this preliminary injunction turns on whether the challenged documents \ncomplied with the APA.”  States Br. at 52.  For that reason, a preliminary injunction here doesn’t \nstep on the toes of another court.  Saying that the Documents aren’t procedurally valid does not \n“negate” any out-of-circuit precedent.  AMC Ent., 549 F.3d at 773.  Indeed, the precedent \nremains in effect.  And no “conflicting order[]” has been issued.  Feller v. Brock, 802 F.2d 722, \n728 (4th Cir. 1986).   \nAs of now, no court has ruled on the lawfulness of the Documents—not even the district \ncourt below because we are in the preliminary-injunction phase.  So there is no conflict with \nanother court’s jurisdiction.   \nV. \n  For the reasons above, we AFFIRM. \n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 49 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2675\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 45 (50 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 45 \n \n_________________ \nDISSENT \n_________________ \nBOGGS,  Circuit  Judge,  dissenting.    I  would  vacate  the  preliminary  injunction  and \ndismiss this case for lack of standing.  In my view, the Interpretation, “Dear Educator” Letter, \nand Fact Sheet (collectively, “the Documents”) are interpretative rules or policy statements, \nwhich are generally not final for purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure \nAct.1  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  Legislative rules, to which the APA’s notice-and-comment provisions \napply, have the “force and effect of law”; interpretative actions, to which those provisions do not \napply, have no such force and effect and are thus not subject to judicial review.  Mann Constr., \nInc. v. United States, 27 F.4th 1138, 1143 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting Perez v. Mortg. Bankers \nAss’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96–97 (2015)).  Distinguishing between the two is often difficult, but some \nguideposts help.  Legislative rules impose new rights or obligations on regulated parties, while \ninterpretative rules “articulate what an agency thinks a statute means.”  Ibid.  Legislative rules, \nthen, bind agencies by stripping them of their decision-making discretion, while interpretations \nare mere “clarifying documents” that “bind[] no one.”  Valero Energy Corp. v. EPA, 927 F.3d \n532, 537–38 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  The Documents here are paradigmatic interpretations.  Exactly as \nexpected, they articulate what the Department thinks Title IX means.  They do not create legal \nobligations  or  bind  the  Department  to  the  position  that  any  particular  conduct  constitutes \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. \nConditional phrases like “depending on the facts” and non-exhaustive lists of “examples” \nare “telltale signs . . . of a nonbinding policy statement, not of reviewable agency action.”  \nArizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 387–88 (6th Cir. 2022).  And the Documents are chock full of \n \n1There is some debate in the courts as to whether finality or reviewability, as a formal matter, is distinct \nfrom the question of an action’s interpretative or legislative nature.  Decades of administrative law, however, make \nclear that the characteristics that make something an interpretative rule are the same characteristics that make that \nrule non-final (and thus unreviewable) under the APA.  See, e.g., Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) \n(final actions are ones “by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will \nflow”); Am. Tort Reform Ass’n v. OSHA, 738 F.3d 387, 395 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“‘Interpretative rules’ that do not \nestablish a binding norm are not subject to judicial review under the APA.”); Cal. Communities Against Toxics v. \nEPA, 934 F.3d 627, 635 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (recognizing relationship between finality and legislative rules). \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 50 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2676\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 46 (51 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 46 \n \nthis type of language.  When a complaint meets the requirements described in the Interpretation, \nthe Documents do not require the Department to punish an educational entity.  Rather, the \nDepartment will at most “open an investigation.”  Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. 32637, 32639 \n(June 22, 2021).  Likewise, the Interpretation “does not determine the outcome of any particular \ncase or set of facts.”  Ibid.  It only “guide[s]” the Department.  Ibid.  For each complaint, the \nDepartment will address “the specific compliance concerns.”  Ibid.  And the Fact Sheet provides \nonly “[e]xamples of the kinds of incidents [the Department] can investigate.”  Fact Sheet, p. 1.  \nThe Documents take no position on how to identify a student’s gender identity or whether any \nspecific  conduct  alleged  in  a  complaint  in  fact  violates  Title  IX.    Thus,  not  only  do  the \nDocuments preserve the discretion of Department staff to determine whether any conduct alleged \nin  any  complaint  violates  Title  IX,  but  they  also  preserve  the  Department’s  discretion  to \ninvestigate conduct at all.  The Department is not, as with Ulysses binding himself to the mast to \nresist the call of the Sirens, dictating to itself the action it must take whenever a particular type of \ncomplaint comes in. \nIn this important respect, the Documents differ from the agency actions considered in \nKentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 594–95 (6th Cir. 2022), and Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. \n2355, 2366–67 (2023), upon which the majority relies to craft its “proprietary-interest theory” of \nstate standing.  In Kentucky, we held that states had standing to challenge federal guidance \n“mandating that the employees of federal contractors . . . become fully vaccinated against \nCOVID-19.”  23 F.4th at 589 (emphasis added).  If an employee was working in a “covered \ncontract,” the guidance  required that employee to  be vaccinated against  COVID-19.   Ibid.  \nSimilarly, in Nebraska, the Supreme Court entertained a challenge by several states to the \nSecretary of Education’s student-loan-forgiveness plan.  143 S. Ct. at 2362.  The Secretary’s plan \nidentified specific and quantifiable requirements for qualifying loans—“[f]or borrowers with an \nadjusted gross income below $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 who have eligible federal loans, \nthe Department of Education will discharge the balance of those loans in an amount up to \n$10,000 per borrower.”  Id. at 2365 (emphasis added).  Unlike the Documents at issue here, these \nactions involved no exercise of discretion by agency staff.  If an employee was covered, she was \nrequired to get a vaccine.  If a borrower had eligible federal loans, the Department would \ndischarge up to $10,000 of his loan balance.  Here, though, the Department must still decide \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 51 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2677\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 47 (52 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 47 \n \nwhether each filed complaint warrants an investigation and, ultimately, whether any complained-\nof action constitutes sex discrimination.  This obligation is based on Title IX alone, which \nrequires the Department to investigate claims of sex discrimination.  The Documents explain to \nthe  public  that  the  Department  believes  that  the  sex  discrimination  prohibited  by  Title  IX \nincludes discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  And they do so at a high \nlevel of generality.  The Documents do not answer, for example, the most prominent question in \npublic  discourse  concerning  this  subject:  whether  separating  athletic  teams  and  events  by \nbiological sex constitutes discrimination based on gender identity. \nIn School of the Ozarks v. Biden, the Eighth Circuit followed a similar rationale to hold \nthat a college did not have standing to challenge a memorandum by the Department of Housing \nand  Urban  Development  that  directed  the  Department’s  Office  of  Fair  Housing  and  Equal \nOpportunity to “accept for filing and investigate all complaints of sex discrimination, including \ndiscrimination because of gender identity or sexual orientation.”  41 F.4th 992, 996 (8th Cir. \n2022).  The Ozarks court reasoned that an injunction against the memorandum “would not stop \nthe Department from investigating all complaints of sex discrimination . . . including complaints \nof discrimination because of gender identity or sexual orientation” because the agency was still \nrequired by statute to investigate sex-discrimination claims.  Id. at 1001.  The memorandum \nmerely defined what the agency believed to be sex discrimination.  The agency could easily hold \nthat same belief regardless of whether it circulated the memorandum to its staff.  Ibid.  The same \nis true here.  With or without the Documents, the Department can investigate, for example, a \ncomplaint alleging that a school prevented a biologically male, transgender, high-school student \nfrom using the girls’ restroom or allowed students to harass their gay or transgender peers. \nThe majority finds School of the Ozarks “questionable,” but I do not understand why.  \nTrue, Ozarks concerned an internal agency memorandum, but there is no rule that an agency’s \nstatements are mere interpretations of a statute only if they are not made public.  To the contrary, \nregulated entities and the public alike benefit when an agency announces how it interprets and \nintends to enforce a statute.  Hoctor v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 82 F.3d 165, 167 (7th Cir. 1996).  \nI disagree that it is “not at all clear in this case” that “the agency could still get to the same \noutcome by interpreting the underlying statute in a way that tracks the documents.”  Ante at 11 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 52 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2678\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 48 (53 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 48 \n \nn.10.  It seems perfectly clear that it could do so because the Documents only do what agency \nstaff do on a case-by-case basis—authorize a particular investigation and potentially support a \nfinding of sanctionable conduct. \nEven so, the majority asserts that the Documents are binding because “the Department \nleaves itself no room to take the position that Title IX does not prohibit discrimination based on \nsexual orientation or gender identity.”  Ante at 22.  But even if that were true, the Department \nstill must determine what constitutes this discrimination.  The Documents do not establish that \nany specific conduct constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  \nEven the specific incidents described in the Fact Sheet are only “[e]xamples of the kinds of the \nincidents [the Department] can investigate.”  Fact Sheet, p. 1 (emphasis added).  They are not \nexamples of incidents that the Department will investigate, nor of incidents that necessarily \nviolate Title IX.  As with all Title IX complaints, the Department remains free to decide both \nwhether  to  investigate  an  incident  and,  if  it  does,  whether  the  incident  violates  Title  IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination.  The Documents rather explain what the Department thinks, at \na high level of generality, such discrimination includes.   \nIn particular, the Documents say nothing about the most contested and controversial \naspect of what is phrased as “gender identity” or “transgender status.”  Thus, in adding these \ncategories to standard harassment analysis “on the basis of sex,” it is fairly easy to see how the \nperception of these statuses would work out.   Consider the classic high-school  harassment \nactivity of stuffing the victim in their locker.  See, e.g., Lean on Me (Norman Twain Productions \n1989).  In many circumstances, if this is done to females but not to males who are similarly \nperceived as “dweebs” or members of the chess club, this would be actionable student-on-student \nharassment.  See, e.g., S.C. v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 86 F.4th 707, 714 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(explaining that, under Title IX, schools may be liable for “deliberate indifference” to student-\non-student harassment committed “under the school’s disciplinary authority”).  And thus if \nsimilar  treatment  is  meted  out  because  a  person  is  perceived  as  gay  or  transgender,  the \napplication of the statute and regulations might be clear (and the plaintiffs, from their filings and \narguments, do not seem concerned about being subject to this type of investigation). \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 53 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2679\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 49 (54 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 49 \n \nHowever, in the most controversial and fraught areas of access to sex-separated private \nspaces and athletic teams (which are explicitly permitted under 20 U.S.C. § 1686 and 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.41(b)), the application is much less clear.  At oral argument, I asked the lawyer for the \nDepartment if the Documents contained any definition of “transgender” or “gender identity,” or \nif an application of the status  “transgender” might require a line-drawing  exercise along  a \ncontinuum.  The counsel readily agreed that the Documents do not address this matter.  See Tr. \nof Oral Argument at p. 8, ll. 10–24 (“Not reflected in these documents, Your Honor.  These \ndocuments don’t speak to it.”).  \nThus, one could come up with a typology of steps in a “transition” that we have no idea \nof when or how the Department might deal with.  For example: \n•  A simple declaration of transgender status, perhaps by a change of name \nor demand for grammatical adjustment.2 \n•  Modest changes in appearance, as by clothing choices and other cosmetic \n(either by definition or by adjustment of substances to alter appearance) \nchoices. \n•  Application or adjustment of hormones or other drugs that might alter a \nperson’s manner of presentation. \n•  Physical and surgical alterations, such as castration or mastectomy. \n•  Surgical  alterations  or  implementations  to  resemble  the  genitals  of  a \ndifferent sex. \nAll of these could be seen as simply a variety of methods of changing, in greater or lesser degree, \nthe way in which human beings, whether biologically male or female, choose to “present” \nthemselves in  personal  interaction or general  society.   See generally  Erving  Goffman, The \nPresentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959).  The degree to which a state needs to adjust to or \nfear departmental policy is not clear, as would also be the case in the absence of the Documents. \n \n2Even a name change might not be necessary.  In the classic Saturday Night Live sketches, Julia Sweeney \nplayed an androgynous person named Pat whose interactions often left other people unsure of Pat’s biological sex or \ngender identity.  See, e.g., Saturday Night Live: Pat at the Office (NBC television broadcast Dec. 1, 1990).  Another \nexample comes in the context of the Social Security Administration’s name roles, where names like Kris (50% \nfemale), Carey (48% female), Riley (49% female), and Emerson (47% female) might provide little insight to \nwhether a person conforms to conventional sex or gender clues.  See Soc. Sec. Admin., National Name Data, \nhttps://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip; Andrew Flowers, “The Most Common Unisex Names in America,” \nFiveThirtyEight  (June  10,  2015,  9:16  AM),  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-922-unisex-names-in-\namerica-is-yours-one-of-them. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 54 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2680\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 50 (55 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 50 \n \n  I agree that the Documents are intended to have in terrorem effect on states and school \ndistricts such as the plaintiffs.  They clearly can be interpreted as desiring a change in voluntary \npolicies  by  recipients  of  federal  funding.    However,  the  same  could  be  said  of  a  major \nPresidential address or a Secretarial campaign targeting the States with speeches and public \nstatements. \n  In order to actually have operational consequences beyond those stemming from the \nstatute  itself,  what  would  be  needed  are  specific  regulations,  promulgated  after  notice  and \ncomment.  And this is in fact what the Department has done to some extent, in regulations \nfinalized  recently.    See  Nondiscrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Sex  in  Education  Programs  or \nActivities  Receiving  Federal  Financial  Assistance,  89  Fed.  Reg.  33474  (Apr.  29,  2024).  \nInterestingly, these regulations, not directly at issue here, though they well may be the subject of \nseparate litigation, do not directly address the controversial areas above.   \nTo be blunt, the issue that will need to be decided at some point in other venues and \nlitigation is whether it is “discrimination” to treat people who have XY chromosomes, who have \na penis or once had a penis, or who can or once could produce sperm, just the same as one treats \nall others in those categories, or whether it is instead “discrimination” to treat the very same \npeople the same way, or to refuse to treat the very same people differently, if they choose to \ndeclare or present at some point along the possible continuum laid out above.3   \nThe Documents, which again only explain the Department’s interpretation at a high level \nof generality, do not answer this core question or many others.  To hold, as the majority does, \nthat  such  interpretative  actions  “legally  bind  an  agency”  implies  that  a  person  alleging \ndiscrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity  would  be  entitled  to  sue  the \nDepartment if it or a defendant did not investigate that person’s complaint.  And this cannot be \nreconciled  with  the  core  principle  of  administrative  law  that  “enforcement  priorities  are \n‘committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law.’”    Arizona,  40  F.4th  at  389  (quoting  5  U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2)).  The Documents are only an explanation that the Department will enforce Title IX \n \n3Or, of course, the same applies to equal treatment of people with XX chromosomes, people who have or \nonce had vaginas, or can or once could produce human ova. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 55 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2681\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 51 (56 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 51 \n \nto prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, without binding itself \nto what actions will be found to constitute that discrimination. \nThe majority makes several potentially extravagant claims.  It states that “winning” this \nlitigation  means  “that  the  States  shouldn’t  be  subjected  to  administrative  investigations  or \nproceedings at all.”  Ante at 32.  Does this mean that injunctive relief is available against any \ninvestigation into any complaint that even mentions sexual orientation or gender identity?  It \nconcludes that the Documents—which only discuss when the Department might investigate a \ncomplaint—“legally bind” the Department.  Ante at 22.  Does this mean that if the injunction \nbelow is reversed, a student could sue the Department if it does not investigate the student’s \ncomplaint?    That  seems  an  extravagant  proposition—but  a  necessary  implication  of  the \nmajority’s position. \nThe majority also claims that the inquiry into whether a rule is binding is actually not \n“helpful” to determine whether the rule is interpretative or legislative.  Ante at 35 n.30 (citing \nAm. Mining Cong. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1111 (D.C. Cir. 1993)).  This \nis a puzzling assertion. Whether a rule is binding is a key inquiry.  See, e.g., Perez, 575 U.S. at \n97 (“Interpretative rules ‘do not have the force and effect of law and are not accorded that weight \nin the adjudicatory process.’” (quoting Shalala v. Guernsey Mem’l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 99 \n(1995))); Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 251–52 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“An agency \naction that sets forth legally binding requirements for a private party to obtain a permit or license \nis a legislative rule. . . . [A]n agency action that merely interprets a prior statute or regulation, \nand  does  not  itself  purport  to  impose  new  obligations  or  prohibitions  or  requirements  on \nregulated parties, is an interpretive rule.”); Am. Tort Reform Ass’n v. OSHA, 738 F.3d 387, 395 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (interpretative rules “do not establish a binding norm”). \nIn any event, the Department can easily take the position that “Title IX does not prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity,” ante at 22—or interpret that \ndiscrimination in a different way—by simply rescinding the Documents.  See Perez, 575 U.S. at \n101 (“Because an agency is not required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial \ninterpretative rule, it is also not required to use those procedures when it amends or repeals that \ninterpretative rule.”).  Indeed, the Trump Administration did exactly that in 2017 when it issued, \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 56 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2682\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 52 (57 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 52 \n \nwithout notice and comment, a “Dear Colleague” letter withdrawing what it called “statements of \npolicy and guidance” that interpreted 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 to “require access to sex-segregated \nfacilities based on gender identity.”  See Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights, Dear Colleague \nLetter (Feb. 22, 2017), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-\nix.pdf.  And there has been no argument that this letter or its subsequent recission required \nnotice-and-comment procedures.   \nTo be sure, this rescission is not at issue here.  But as the majority correctly points out, \nwe can “look to surrounding context—for example, how an agency has made use of the action or \nwhat it has said about it.”  Ante at 22.  And this history suggests that the Department has \nconsistently considered itself free to rescind actions such as the Documents at any point without \nwarning or notice-and-comment procedures.  In that sense, these Documents are no different \nthan  a  speech  given  by  the  Secretary  or  the  President,  announcing  that  henceforth  the \nDepartment will take a particular litigating position in enforcing Title IX but leaving it free to \nchange course if it determines that to be warranted.  That certainly does not “evoke[] binding \nlegal effect,” ibid. \nPut simply, the Documents explain legal obligations; they do not create them.  They \nconsistently speak of what the Department believes Title IX requires, not what the Documents \nthemselves require.  And while an agency’s characterization of an action is not dispositive of its \ntrue nature, this conclusion should be obvious here.  The Documents do not “fully enforce” \nthemselves.  They explain the Department’s enforcement of Title IX.  Without Title IX, the \nDocuments are meaningless.  Naturally, any penalties that the States might face or injuries they \nmight incur will flow from the statute, not from the Documents. \nConsider the analogous example of a court interpreting a statute.  As the Supreme Court \nhas explained, “[o]ne would not normally say that a court ‘amends’ a statute when it interprets its \ntext.    So  too  can  an  agency  ‘interpret’  a  regulation  without  ‘effectively  amend[ing]’  the \nunderlying source of law.”  Perez, 575 U.S. at 103.  The same logic applies to an agency that \ninterprets a statute.  We do not say that an agency “amends” a statute when it announces how it \ninterprets the statute’s text.  So when the Department says, for example, that it will “provide \ninformation to assist schools in meeting their legal obligations,” Fact Sheet, p. 1, those legal \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 57 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2683\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-2     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 53 (58 of 59)\nNo. 22-5807  Tennessee, et al. v. Dep’t of Educ., et al.  Page 53 \n \nobligations—and  any  others  related  to  the  Documents—flow  from  Title  IX,  not  from  the \nDocuments themselves. \nNonetheless, the majority claims that the Documents force the States into a supposed \ncatch-22 where they must comply with federal law or lose federal funding.  But the choice faced \nis neither Scylla nor Charybdis.  There is always a choice between following the law and being \npunished.    Here,  the  alleged  liability—losing  federal  funding—is  speculative  at  best.    The \nmajority admits that “not once has the OCR ever cut off funds to enforce Title IX.”  Ante at 31 \n(quoting R. Shep Melnick, The Strange Evolution of Title IX, National Affairs (Summer 2018)).  \nThe threat, then, seems nothing more than “a highly attenuated chain of possibilities” that does \nnot constitute injury in fact.  See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013). And \neven if there were a stronger likelihood that the States would incur this injury, the injury would \nstill flow from Title IX, not the Documents.   \nThe majority also claims that the Documents are legislative because they stem from \nCongress’s delegation of rulemaking authority.  Ante at 36.  But the fact that the Department has \nthis rulemaking authority—and has exercised it in the past to promulgate legislative rules—does \nnot prove that it did so here.  To conclude otherwise would mean that Congress gelds an agency \nby giving it rulemaking authority, making it unable to create simple interpretations.  That is, an \nagency could issue only legislative rules and could never issue interpretative rules or general \nstatements of policy.  Numerous cases, as well as the APA itself, show that this is not true.  See, \ne.g., 5 U.S.C. § 553; Perez, 575 U.S. at 97; Guernsey Mem’l Hosp., 514 U.S. at 99. \nThese realities reveal that the Documents are neither binding in any meaningful sense nor \nthe source of any legal obligations imposed on the States.  Thus, they are not final for purposes \nof judicial review under the APA, regardless of whether petitioners otherwise might meet what \nthe  majority  calls  a  proprietary-interest,  sovereign-interest,  or  procedural-rights  theory  of \nstanding.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b)(A); 704.  The Documents simply do not create legal interests \nor injuries for which the States can seek judicial remedies.  For these reasons, I respectfully \ndissent. \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 143   Filed 06/14/24   Page 58 of 59   PageID #:\n \n2684\n\nCase: 22-5807     Document: 101-3     Filed: 06/14/2024     Page: 1 (59 of 59)\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \n \nNo. 22-5807 \n \n \nSTATE OF TENNESSEE; STATE OF ALABAMA; STATE \nOF  ALASKA;  STATE  OF  ARIZONA;  STATE  OF \nFILED\nARKANSAS; STATE OF GEORGIA; STATE OF IDAHO; \nSTATE  OF  INDIANA;  STATE  OF  KANSAS;  Jun 14, 2024\nCOMMONWEALTH  OF  KENTUCKY;  STATE  OF \nKELLY L.

[Doc. 152]. By way of background, the \nCourt issued a preliminary injunction on July 15, 2022, and stayed the case on November 3, 2022. \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed issuance of the injunction on \nJune 14, 2024. [Doc. 143]. In the interim, the Federal Register published a final rule amending the \nDepartment of Education’s Title IX regulations. [See Doc. 143 at 8 n.1].    \n  The parties’ Joint Status Report [Doc. 158] identifies several other things that happened \nduring the pendency of the appeal. First, on October 1, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Texas declared unlawful and vacated the EEOC’s Technical Assistance \nDocument. See Texas v. E.E.O.C., 633 F. Supp.3d 824 (N.D. Tex. 2022). The EEOC did not appeal \nthat decision. The parties show that since the Technical Assistance Document no longer has any \nlegal effect, Plaintiff States’ claims relating to that document are now moot. \nSecond, on June 11, 2024, another district judge in the Northern District of Texas issued a \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 163   Filed 08/14/24   Page 1 of 4   PageID #: 2726\n\nfinal judgment declaring unlawful the same Title IX guidance documents at issue here – the \nDepartment of Education’s Notice of Interpretation, Dear Educator Letter, and Fact Sheet. Texas \nv. Cardona, Civ. Action No. 4:23-cv-00604-O, 2024 WL 2947022 (N.D. Tex. June 11, 2024). On \nAugust 5, 2024, the district court granted the State of Texas’s motion to amend/correct, vacated \nits memorandum opinion and order, and issued a corrected, superseding memorandum opinion and \norder. The August 5th memorandum opinion and order supersedes the prior order, correcting \ncertain clerical errors and clarifying the scope of declaratory and injunctive relief. The central \nholding remains unchanged. See Texas v. Cardona, Civ. Action No. 4:23-cv-00604-O, 2024 WL \n3658767 (N.D. Texas Aug. 5, 2024) (“[T]he Court holds that Defendants engaged in unlawful \nagency action taken in excess of their authority, all while failing to adhere to the appropriate notice-\nand-comment requirements when doing so.”). A final judgment was entered August 5, 2024, so \nthe 60-day deadline to seek appellate review of the Northern District of Texas’s ruling has not yet \nexpired.  \nCounsel for Defendants represent that the Department has not yet decided whether it will \nappeal the vacatur of the Title IX guidance documents in the Texas litigation. [Doc. 158]. If the \nDepartment does not appeal that ruling, the parties agree that Plaintiffs’ claims challenging the \nguidance documents in this case will be moot. If Defendant does appeal, the parties contend this \ncase should proceed to briefing on dispositive motions. While the parties do not expressly seek a \nstay, they do not request that any deadlines be set at this time. Rather, they propose to file another \nstatus report in 90 days, or within 7 days of either the deadline to appeal in the Texas case or the \nfiling of an appeal in the Texas case, whichever occurs earlier.  \nThe Court agrees that this litigation should not proceed when Plaintiffs’ claims could soon \nbe moot. So a stay is appropriate in the event the Department decides not to appeal the Northern \n2 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 163   Filed 08/14/24   Page 2 of 4   PageID #: 2727\n\nDistrict of Texas judgment. But a stay is also appropriate if the Department does decide to appeal. \nThe parties suggest that if Defendant appeals in the Texas case, dispositive motion briefing should \nproceed here. The Court disagrees. The Court is not inclined to issue a merits decision when a \nnearly identical challenge to the same regulatory documents is before a circuit court. Rather, the \nCourt would await the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  \nThe Department has, moreover, amended the regulations implementing Title IX to clarify \nthe scope and application of Title IX and the obligations of recipients of financial assistance with \nrespect to discrimination on the basis of sex. A final rule was published in the Federal Register in \nApril 2024 and final regulations became effective on August 1, 2024. As the court noted in Texas \nv. Cardona, at least seven lawsuits were filed to prevent the final rule from taking effect and a \nnumber of district courts have preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the final rule. Texas v. \nCardona, 2024 WL 3658767 at * 5 (collecting cases).  \nOn this shifting legal landscape, the Court finds it appropriate to administratively close this \naction. An administrative closure is effectively identical to a stay from a litigant’s perspective. \nThis is so because an administrative closure is for administrative purposes only – it does not \nconstitute a final decision on the merits, or indeed any substantive decision at all. Rather, \n“[a]dministrative closures are a tool of docket management.” Rodriguez v. Hirschberg Acceptance \nCor., 62 F. 4th 270, 274 (6th Cir. 2023). They allow courts to remove cases from their active files \nwithout making any final adjudication. Id. (quoting Penn W. Assocs., Inc. v. Cohen, 371 F.3d 118, \n127 (3d Cir. 2004)). “The closing has no effect other than to remove a case from the district court’s \nactive docket and permit the transfer of records associated with the case to an appropriate storage \nrepository.” Id. (cleaned up, citation omitted). \nHere, Plaintiffs’ challenge to the guidance documents will either become moot or a nearly \n3 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 163   Filed 08/14/24   Page 3 of 4   PageID #: 2728\n\nidentical challenge will be before the Fifth Circuit. This case has already been pending for nearly \nthree years and stayed for over a year and a half. The Court cannot know what contingencies may \nextend the Texas proceedings if an appeal is taken; it is not uncommon for appellate review to take \nyears, not months. Given these possibilities and the likely duration of any appeal, the Court finds \nthat administrative closure is the most appropriate course of action. \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that this case is ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED until \nfurther order of the Court. This closure is for administrative purposes only and does not constitute \na final decision on the merits, nor does it impact any claims or defenses that may be asserted in \nthis action. The preliminary injunction [Doc. 86] remains in effect.  \nThe Court will entertain a motion to reopen by either party at any time, including for the \npurpose of setting a briefing schedule or dismissing the case with or without prejudice.

Defendants \ndo not oppose the Motion, but all remaining Plaintiff States do oppose (the “Co-Plaintiffs”).  \nOn July 15, 2022, the Court denied Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 49] and granted \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. 10]. [Doc. 86]. The Court enjoined Defendants \nfrom implementing against the Plaintiff States the agency documents challenged in this action. \n[Doc. 86]. On September 13, 2022, Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal [Doc. 100] as to the \nCourt’s Memorandum Opinion and Order [Doc. 86]. The United States Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit recently issued an opinion affirming the Court’s issuance of the injunction [Doc. 101-\n2], but a mandate has not yet issued. \n  Several months after the appeal, on March 27, 2023, the State of Arizona filed its Motion \nto Drop State of Arizona as a Party [Doc. 129]. Following the Sixth Circuit’s decision, Arizona \nrenews its request to be dropped as a party. [Doc. 153]. \nIn its Motion [Doc. 129], the State of Arizona shows that it no longer wishes to be a Plaintiff \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 154   Filed 07/19/24   Page 1 of 6   PageID #: 2701\n\nin this action. Anticipating opposition from its Co-Plaintiffs, Arizona argues Co-Plaintiffs’ consent \nis not necessary. The State argues that though the preliminary injunction order was appealed, the \nappeal did not divest this Court of jurisdiction to proceed with the action on the merits. Given this \nauthority, Arizona argues that the Court can certainly do something as simple as grant a plaintiff’s \nrequest to be dropped from the action. Arizona also argues there is no prejudice to any other party \nif it is removed from the case, while forcing the State to remain a Plaintiff requires it to devote \nresources to litigation it no longer wishes to pursue.  \n  In their Response [Doc. 131], Co-Plaintiffs argue that the Court likely lacks jurisdiction to \ndrop the State of Arizona as a party while Defendants’ preliminary injunction appeal is pending. \nCo-Plaintiffs argue that while a district court retains jurisdiction as to some aspects of the case, it \nmay not alter or enlarge the scope of any judgment pending appeal. Specifically, Co-Plaintiffs \nargue that if dropping the State of Arizona as a party narrows the scope of the preliminary \ninjunction, that would likewise change the scope of the appeal. Finally, Co-Plaintiffs argue there \nis a split of authority regarding the extent to which a district court can modify a preliminary \ninjunction  while  the  injunction  is  on  appeal  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  62(d). \nAccording to Co-Plaintiffs, granting the motion is not justified under either of the prevailing \napproaches.  \n  The State of Arizona’s reply urges that Rule 21 is governed by a liberal standard and Co-\nPlaintiff’s desire to force Arizona to remain in this litigation is not a justification for denial. \nArizona emphasizes that an appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction does not divest \nthe Court of jurisdiction. According to Arizona, the Court’s “judgment” will not be enlarged \nbecause there is no judgment, and the preliminary injunction does not need to be modified in order \nto drop Arizona as a party.  \n2\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 154   Filed 07/19/24   Page 2 of 6   PageID #: 2702\n\n  “As a general rule the filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction \nand transfers jurisdiction to the court of appeals.” Cochran v. Birkel, 651 F.2d 1219, 1221 (6th Cir. \n1981). However, “an appeal from an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction does not \ndivest the district court of jurisdiction to proceed with the action on the merits.” Zundel v. Holder, \n687 F.3d 271, 282 (6th Cir. 2012). The Sixth Circuit has explained that “[a]lthough a district court \nmay not alter or enlarge the scope of its judgment pending appeal, it does retain jurisdiction to \nenforce the judgment.” City of Cookeville v. Upper Cumberland Elec. Membership Corp., 484 \nF.3d 380, 394 (6th Cir. 2007) (holding district court erred by issuing injunction during appeal).  \n  The State of Arizona urges that there has been no “judgment” here, so the precedent \nprohibiting a court from altering or enlarging a judgment while it is on appeal simply does not \napply. Arizona cites no supporting authority on this point. In some contexts, courts treat a \npreliminary injunction as a judgment, for example, in considering a motion to alter or amend a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). S.B. ex rel M.B. v. Lee, 567 F. Supp.3d \n850, 855-56 (E.D. Tenn. 2021) (“The Court’s order granting a preliminary injunction . . . is a \njudgment for purposes of Rule 59(e).”). So it is possible that this precedent applies even though a \ntraditional judgment has not entered.  \n  Second, the Court is not persuaded by Arizona’s contention that dropping the State as a \nparty requires no modification of the preliminary injunction order. This may be true in a literal \nsense because the Order enjoins the Defendants from implementing certain documents “against \nPlaintiffs.” But dropping Arizona as a party would substantively narrow the scope of the injunction \n– Defendants would presumably no longer be enjoined from enforcing the subject documents \nagainst the State of Arizona. Such a change is far more salient than whether the Order would need \nto be reworded to omit reference to Arizona. \n3\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 154   Filed 07/19/24   Page 3 of 6   PageID #: 2703\n\n   Because the scope of the preliminary injunction would be “modified” by dropping Arizona \nas a party, the Court turns to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62. The Rule provides, in pertinent \npart:  \nWhile an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order . . . that grants . . . an \ninjunction, the court may . . . modify an injunction on terms for bond or other terms \nthat secure the opposing party’s rights. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 62(d).  \n“The Sixth Circuit has recognized that there is a circuit split regarding the extent to which \na district court can modify its preliminary injunction while it is on appeal.” Planned Parenthood \nGreat Nw., Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana & Kentucky, Inc. v. Cameron, Civ. Act. No. 3:22-cv-198-\nRGJ, 2022 WL 5200186, at *2 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 5, 2022) (citing Basicomputer Corp. v. Scott, 973 \nF.2d 507, 513 (6th Cir. 1992)). In Basicomputer, the Sixth Circuit noted that, at the time, three \ncircuits  had  limited  a  district  court’s  authority  to  modify  an  injunction  pending  appeal  to \nmodifications that preserve the status quo. 973 F.2d at 513. Two other circuits had concluded that, \nin some circumstances, “the district court may alter the status quo by modifying an injunction \nduring the pendency of an appeal.” Id. In Basicomputer, the Sixth Circuit held that the lower \ncourt’s order was based on an erroneous view of state law, so it did not reach the issue of the \ndistrict court’s authority to modify an appealed injunction.  \n  The parties cite no authority to suggest that the Sixth Circuit has resolved this question in \nthe 30 years since the Basicomputer decision. If a district court’s authority to modify a preliminary \ninjunction is limited to maintaining the status quo, it seems clear that removing a plaintiff would \nbe impermissible. Defendants’ obligations under the injunction would materially change. The \nalternate view is that a district court can “modify an injunction to preserve the integrity of the \nproceedings before the court of appeals.” Planned Parenthood, 2022 WL 5200186; see Graveline \n4\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 154   Filed 07/19/24   Page 4 of 6   PageID #: 2704\n\nv. Johnson, 2018 WL 4184577, *2-3 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 30, 2018) (“[T]he Court finds that its \njurisdiction is limited; it may only act to: (1) preserve the status quo between the parties; or (2) \npreserve the integrity of the proceedings before the court of appeals.”). Narrowing the scope of the \npreliminary injunction in this case preserves neither the status quo nor the integrity of the \nproceedings before the court of appeals.  \nModification to the preliminary injunction is particularly questionable in this case because \nPlaintiffs’ standing to bring this action is the focal point of the preliminary injunction order and \nthe Sixth Circuit’s opinion. As the Sixth Circuit explained, the States had to show a substantial \nlikelihood of standing to be entitled to a preliminary injunction. [Doc. 101-2 at 7]. “If any State \ncan’t make this showing, we must deny it preliminary relief, but we don’t have to dismiss the State \nfrom the case, as long as one State has standing.” [Id.]. In its sovereign interest analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit noted, for example, that “several states” had conflicting policies in place at the time the \ncomplaint was filed. [Id. at 16]. The Court ultimately concluded that “all twenty States have a \nsubstantial likelihood of standing under a procedural-rights theory.” [Id. at 17]. Nonetheless, the \nPlaintiff-specific inquiry demonstrates that dropping one State as a party could conceivably impact \nthe issues on appeal.   \nIt is, admittedly, somewhat confounding that a plaintiff can be forced to remain a party to \nlitigation it no longer wishes to pursue. But this is not as novel as the State of Arizona suggests. \nIndeed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 permits a plaintiff to dismiss an action without a court \norder in limited circumstances: by dismissing the action before the opposing party serves an \nanswer or motion for summary judgment or by filing a stipulation of dismissal “signed by all \nparties who have appeared.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1). Otherwise, “an action may be dismissed at \nthe plaintiff’s request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.” Fed. R. Civ. \n5\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 154   Filed 07/19/24   Page 5 of 6   PageID #: 2705\n\nP. 41(a)(2). So even if all Plaintiffs wanted to dismiss this action in its entirety, they wouldn’t be \nable to do so without either the consent of all parties who have appeared or a Court order. Parties \nare always free to resolve their disputes privately. But once they choose to bring their dispute into \nfederal court, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern how and under what circumstances \nparties and claims can be dismissed or dropped.  \n  Removing the State of Arizona from this lawsuit would necessarily modify the preliminary \ninjunction order. And it could conceivably impact the issues on appeal, as various standing theories \nhave been advanced. Under these circumstances, the Court will not disturb the status quo. \nAccordingly, the Motion to Drop State of Arizona as a Party [Doc. 129] is DENIED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE. Following the conclusion of the appeal, the Court will promptly address a renewed \nmotion by the State of Arizona pursuant to Rule 21. \n  SO ORDERED. \n            /s/ Charles E.

[Doc. 87]. On July 15, 2022, the Court issued an Order granting Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction and denying Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. [Doc. 86]. \nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(4), Defendants have 14-days from the Court’s action to file a \nresponsive pleading, resulting in a deadline of July 29, 2022.  \n  Defendants seek to stay their deadline to Answer the Complaint until 14-days after the \nCourt resolves the forthcoming cross-motions for summary judgment; or alternatively, to extend \ntheir deadline to Answer the Complaint for 60-days. [Doc. 87]. Plaintiffs argue that good cause \ndoes not exist to ignore the standard operation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. [Doc. 88].  \nHowever, Plaintiffs agree to an extension of Defendants’ Answer deadline to August 15, 2022. \n[Id.].  \n  As explained below, the Court finds Defendants have not demonstrated good reason to \nextend the Answer deadline as requested.  \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 91   Filed 07/28/22   Page 1 of 3   PageID #: 2013\n\n  Defendants claim that they are “in the process of assessing the July 15 decision and \ndetermining appropriate next steps” and “[t]hat process would be delayed if Defendants were \nrequired to quickly file an Answer to Plaintiffs’ 35-page Complaint.” [Doc. 87 at ¶ 4]. Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B) provides Defendants with 60-days to decide whether to appeal the Court’s \ndecision. Defendants’ right to appeal is wholly unrelated to their obligation to file a responsive \npleading under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a). Defendants can continue to consider whether to appeal the \nCourt’s decision after filing an Answer to the Complaint. \n  Defendants claim that “[a]n extension is also reasonable and warranted due to several \nupcoming deadlines and other scheduling conflicts for undersigned counsel” including “several \nmotions for summary judgment and an opposition to a preliminary injunction motion, a deposition, \nan oral argument, and upcoming administrative leave.” [Doc. 87 at ¶ 9]. The Court understands \nand is sympathetic that counsel for Defendants have demanding schedules; however, the Court is \nnot  persuaded  by  this  proffered  justification.  Counsel  for  Defendants  are  employed  by  the \nDepartment of Justice, a federal executive department of the United States Government. The \nDepartment of Justice has adequate resources to devote to litigating this case.  \n   This case has been pending for nearly a year, and Defendants have had adequate time to \nconsider the allegations in the Complaint while awaiting the Court’s decision. This case cannot \ncontinue to proceed until Defendants file an Answer to the Complaint. Nevertheless, because \nPlaintiffs agree to a limited extension of the Answer deadline, the Court will give Defendants   \nsome additional time to prepare an Answer. \n  For the reasons above, Defendants’ Motion to Stay, or in the Alternative, to Extend the \nAnswer Deadline [Doc. 87] is GRANTED IN PART. Defendants SHALL file a responsive \npleading in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a) on or before August 15, 2022. \n  2 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 91   Filed 07/28/22   Page 2 of 3   PageID #: 2014\n\n  SO ORDERED. \n            /s/  Charles E.

President Biden directed federal agencies to rewrite federal law to implement the \nAdministration’s policy of “prevent[ing] and combat[ing] discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity or sexual orientation.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021).  \nIn response, the Department of Education (“Department”) and Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission (“EEOC”), each flouting procedural requirements in their rush to overreach, issued \n“interpretations” of federal antidiscrimination law far beyond what the statutory text, regulatory \nrequirements, judicial precedent, and the Constitution permit.  \n2.  The Department and EEOC claim that their interpretations are required by the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).  But Bostock \nwas a narrow decision.  The Court held only that terminating an employee “simply for being \nhomosexual or transgender” constitutes discrimination “because of . . . sex” under Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1737-38 (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)).   \n3.  The Department interpreted a prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” \nin Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), to encompass \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, notwithstanding that Title IX \nexpressly permits sex separation on the basis of biological sex, see id. § 1686, and that Bostock \nexpressly  disclaimed  any  intent  to  interpret  other  federal  or  state  laws  that  prohibit  sex \ndiscrimination, 140 S. Ct. at 1753. \n4.  The Department compounded that erroneous interpretation by issuing further \nguidance in a “Fact Sheet” that similarly disregards Title IX’s plain text.  Among other things, \nthe guidance warns that the Department can launch an investigation if a school prevents a student \n2 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 2 of 38   PageID #: 2\n\nfrom joining an athletic team or using the restroom that corresponds to the student’s gender \nidentity, or if a student’s peers decline to use the student’s preferred pronouns.   \n5.  The EEOC Chair unilaterally issued a “technical assistance document” declaring, \namong other things, that requiring transgender employees to use the shower, locker room, or \nrestroom that corresponds to their biological sex, or to adhere to the dress code that corresponds \nto their biological sex, constitutes discrimination under Title VII (which the EEOC administers \nand enforces in part), notwithstanding that the Supreme Court expressly declined to “prejudge” \nthose issues.  Id. \n6.  This recent guidance from the Department and the EEOC concerns issues of \nenormous importance to the States, employers, educational institutions, employees, students, and \nother individual citizens.  The guidance purports to resolve highly controversial and localized \nissues such as whether employers and schools may maintain sex-separated showers and locker \nrooms, whether schools must allow biological males to compete on female athletic teams, and \nwhether individuals may be compelled to use another person’s preferred pronouns.  But the \nagencies have no authority to resolve those sensitive questions, let alone to do so by executive \nfiat without providing any opportunity for public participation. \n7.  Plaintiffs—the  States  of  Tennessee,  Alabama,  Alaska,  Arizona,  Arkansas, \nGeorgia,  Idaho,  Indiana,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Montana, \nNebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia—sue to prevent \nthe agencies from usurping authority that properly belongs to Congress, the States, and the people \nand to eliminate the nationwide confusion and upheaval that the agencies’ recent guidance has \ninflicted on States and other regulated entities. \n3 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 3 of 38   PageID #: 3\n\nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff the State of Tennessee is a sovereign State and an employer subject to \nthe requirements of Title VII.  \n9.  Tennessee is home to political subdivisions and other employers that are subject \nto the requirements of Title VII.  \n10.  Tennessee’s  legislature  is  constitutionally  obligated  to  “provide  for  the \nmaintenance, support and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools.”  Tenn. Const. \nart. XI, § 12.  Tennessee’s state board of education is responsible for developing “rules, policies, \nstandards, and guidelines . . . that are necessary for the proper operation of public education in \npre-kindergarten through grade twelve.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-1-102(a). \n11.  Tennessee’s  legislature  may  also  “establish  and  support  .  .  .  postsecondary \neducational institutions, including public institutions of higher learning.”  Tenn. Const. art. XI, \n§ 12.  Tennessee currently has 51 public institutions of higher learning, including nine public \nuniversities, two special-purpose institutes, 13 community colleges, and 27 colleges of applied \ntechnology.  \n12.  Tennessee  operates  educational  programs  and  activities  that  receive  federal \nfunding and thus are subject to Title IX’s requirements.  For example, the Tennessee Department \nof Education directly operates state special schools that receive federal funding, including the \nTennessee School for the Blind; the Tennessee School for the Deaf, which has three campuses; \nand the Alvin C. York Agricultural Institute.  Tennessee’s public universities also receive federal \nfunding. \n13.  Tennessee is also home to nearly 150 “local education agencies”—i.e., school \ndistricts—that are created or authorized by Tennessee’s legislature, Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-1-\n103, and receive federal funding and thus are subject to Title IX’s requirements, as well as \n4 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 4 of 38   PageID #: 4\n\nnumerous private educational institutions that receive federal funding and thus are subject to \nTitle IX’s requirements.  \n14.  In fiscal year 2020-2021, educational programs and activities in Tennessee that \nare funded through the Tennessee Department of Education are estimated to have received \napproximately $1.5 billion in federal funding.   During the same period, public higher educational \ninstitutions in Tennessee are estimated to have received approximately $88 million in federal \nfunding.   \n15.  Plaintiffs the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, \nIndiana,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Montana,  Nebraska,  Ohio, \nOklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia likewise are employers that are \nsubject to the requirements of Title VII and oversee and operate educational institutions and other \neducational programs and activities that receive federal funding and thus are subject to the \nrequirements of Title IX.    \n16.  Plaintiffs the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, \nIndiana,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Montana,  Nebraska,  Ohio, \nOklahoma,  South  Carolina,  South  Dakota,  and  West  Virginia  are  also  home  to  political \nsubdivisions and other employers that are subject to the requirements of Title VII and to local \nschool districts and private educational institutions that are subject to the requirements of Title \nIX. \n17.  Defendant United States Department of Education is an executive agency of the \nfederal government responsible for enforcement and administration of Title IX.  20 U.S.C. \n§§ 3411, 3441.  \n5 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 5 of 38   PageID #: 5\n\n18.  Defendant Miguel Cardona is the United States Secretary of Education and is \nresponsible for the operation of the Department of Education.  Id. § 3411.  He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n19.  Defendant Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a federal agency \ncharged with limited enforcement of, among other things, Title VII.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6.  \n20.  Defendant Charlotte A. Burrows is the Chair of the EEOC.  As Chair, she is \nresponsible for implementation and administration of EEOC policy.  She is sued in her official \ncapacity. \n21.  Defendant United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is an executive agency \nof the United States and is responsible for the enforcement of, among other things, Title VII.  42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-6.  DOJ also has the authority to enforce Title IX.  Exec. Order No. 12,250, 28 \nC.F.R. part 41, app. A (1980). \n22.  Defendant Merrick B. Garland is the Attorney General of the United States and \nis responsible for the operation of the DOJ.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n23.  Defendant Kristen Clarke is the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at \nDOJ.  She is assigned the responsibility to bring enforcement actions under Titles VII and IX.  \n28 C.F.R. § 42.412.  She is sued in her official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  This Court has federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because this \ncase  concerns  whether  the  Department  and  the  EEOC  acted  in  compliance  with  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and other federal laws.   \n25.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1346, because this case involves a \nclaim against agencies and employees of the federal government.  \n6 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 6 of 38   PageID #: 6\n\n26.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1361, because the Court has \njurisdiction over any case “to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency \nthereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.”  \n27.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1), because (1) Plaintiff \nTennessee resides in this District; (2) Tennessee’s agencies and employees subject to the agency \nactions at issue reside in the District; and (3) “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to [Tennessee’s] claim occurred” in this District.  \n28.  This Court has the authority to grant Plaintiffs the relief they request under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-06; the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201-02; and 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Supreme Court  Narrowly Held in Bostock v. Clayton County That \nTerminating an Employee Simply for Being Homosexual or Transgender \nConstitutes Sex Discrimination Under Title VII.  \n29.  In  Bostock,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held  that  Title  VII’s  prohibition  on \nemployment discrimination “because of [an] individual’s . . . sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), \nincludes terminating that individual simply for being homosexual or transgender, because—\nunder Title VII’s precise wording—“[s]ex plays a necessary and undisguisable role” in such \ndecisions, 140 S. Ct. at 1737.   \n30.  “[O]ther federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination,” such as Title IX, \nwere not “before” the Court.  Id. at 1753.  The Court thus expressly declined to “prejudge” \nwhether its decision in Bostock would “sweep beyond Title VII” to those other laws.  Id. \n31.  Similarly, the Court declined to consider whether employer conduct other than \nterminating an employee simply because the employee is homosexual or transgender—for \n7 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 7 of 38   PageID #: 7\n\nexample,  “sex-segregated  bathrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  dress  codes”—would  constitute \nactionable discrimination under Title VII.  Id. \n32.  The Court assumed that “sex” in Title VII “refer[s] only to biological distinctions \nbetween male and female.”  Id. at 1739.  \n33.  And the Court held that “because of” sex means “by reason of” or “on account \nof” sex.  Id. (quoting Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 350 (2013)).  \n34.  The Court concluded that Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination because of sex \nimposes a “but-for” causation standard, which asks whether “a particular outcome would not \nhave happened ‘but for’ the purported cause.”  Id. (quoting Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 \nU.S. 167, 176 (2009)). \n35.  The Court noted that “but-for” causation standards “can be” “sweeping.”  Id.  \n36.  In the context of Title VII’s but-for causation standard, a “defendant cannot avoid \nliability just by citing some other factor that contributed to its challenged employment decision.  \nSo long as the plaintiff’s sex was one but-for cause of that decision, that is enough to trigger the \nlaw.”  Id. (citing Burrage v. United States, 571 U.S. 204, 211-12 (2014)). \n37.  The Court did not consider or decide what Title IX’s statutory phrase “on the basis \nof sex” means.  \n38.  Nor did the Court address Title IX’s safe harbor for sex-separated living facilities.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1686; 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n39.  Nor did the Court consider or decide questions about any other statute or any other \nform of alleged discrimination.  \n8 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 8 of 38   PageID #: 8\n\nB.  President  Biden  Directed  Federal  Agencies  to  Implement  the \nAdministration’s  Policy  of  Prohibiting  Sexual  Orientation  and  Gender \nIdentity  Discrimination  by  Unreasonably  Interpreting  Federal \nAntidiscrimination Laws. \n40.  As one of his first official acts as President, President Biden declared that \nBostock’s analysis changed the meaning of all federal law regarding sex discrimination: “Under \nBostock’s reasoning, laws that prohibit sex discrimination—including Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), the Fair Housing Act, as amended \n(42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), and section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 \nU.S.C. 1522), along with their respective implementing regulations—prohibit discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain sufficient \nindications to the contrary.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021).   \n41.  Accordingly, President Biden directed federal agencies to “review all existing \norders, regulations, guidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions” that either \n“(i) were promulgated or are administered by the agency under Title VII or any other statute or \nregulation that prohibits sex discrimination, including any that relate to the agency’s own \ncompliance with such statutes or regulations” or “(ii) are or may be inconsistent with the policy \nset forth” in the Executive Order.  Id. \n42.  President Biden further directed that the “head of each agency shall, as soon as \npracticable, also consider whether there are additional actions that the agency should take to \nensure that it is fully implementing the policy” set forth in the Executive Order.  Id. \n43.  Finally, President Biden directed that, within “100 days of the date of this order, \nthe head of each agency shall develop, in consultation with the Attorney General, as appropriate, \na plan to carry out actions that the agency has identified.”  Id. \n44.  On March 26, 2021, the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ released a memorandum \nconcluding that Title IX “prohibit[s] discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual \n9 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 9 of 38   PageID #: 9\n\norientation.”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Memorandum Regarding Application of Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty  to  Title  IX  of  the  Education  Amendments  of  1972  (Mar.  26,  2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/2WpV5zq.  \nC.  Department of Education \n45.  The Department of Education has engaged in at least two agency actions to \nimplement President Biden’s executive order.  \n46.  First, on June 22, 2021, the Department published in the Federal Register its \n“Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With Respect to Discrimination \nBased on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County.” 86 \nFed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021) (“Interpretation”) (attached as Exhibit A).  \n47.  The  Department  acknowledged  that  it  “at  times  has  stated  that  Title  IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination does not encompass discrimination based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity.”  Id. \n48.  In fact, earlier this year, the Department concluded that Bostock did not apply to \nTitle IX or require a different interpretation of Title IX.  See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Memorandum \nfor Kimberly M. Richey Acting Assistant Secretary of the Office for Civil Rights Re: Bostock \nv. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) (Jan. 8, 2021), https://bit.ly/3mwKI7H.  \n49.  The  Department’s  current  view,  however,  is  that  “Title  IX  Prohibits \nDiscrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.”  Interpretation, 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 32,637.  \n50.  The Department’s Interpretation relied heavily on Bostock’s analysis of Title VII.  \nSee id. at 32,637-38.  \n51.  The Department applied Bostock’s Title VII interpretation to Title IX.  See id. at \n32,638 (“Bostock’s Application to Title IX”); see also id. (“[T]he Department has determined \n10 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 10 of 38   PageID #: 10\n\nthat the interpretation of sex discrimination set out by the Supreme Court in Bostock—that \ndiscrimination ‘because of . . . sex’ encompasses discrimination based on sexual orientation and \ngender identity—properly guides the Department’s interpretation of discrimination ‘on the basis \nof sex’ under Title IX and leads to the conclusion that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity.”).  \n52.  The Department first concluded that “[t]here is textual similarity between Title \nVII and Title IX.”  Id. \n53.  In fact, the texts of Title VII and Title IX are materially different: \n•  Title VII: “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to \ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, \nterms,  conditions,  or  privileges  of  employment,  because  of  such \nindividual’s . . . sex[] . . . ; or (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his \nemployees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive \nor  tend  to  deprive  any  individual  of  employment  opportunities  or \notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such \nindividual’s . . . sex . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). \n \n•  Title IX: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \nto  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n54.  Nevertheless, the Department concluded that the phrase “on the basis of sex” in \nTitle IX has the same meaning as the phrase “because of . . . sex” in Title VII.  86 Fed. Reg. at \n32,638. \n55.  The  Department  also  cited  decisions  from  federal  courts  of  appeals  that \n“recognize that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination based \non sexual orientation and gender identity.”  Id. at 32,639 (collecting cases).  \n56.  Meanwhile, the Department failed to cite decisions from federal courts of appeals \nrecognizing that “Title VII differs from Title IX in important respects” and that “principles \nannounced in the Title VII context [do not] automatically apply in the Title IX context.”  \n11 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 11 of 38   PageID #: 11\n\nMeriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021) (noting that, “under Title IX, \nuniversities must consider sex in allocating athletic scholarships, 34 C.F.R. § 106.37(c), and may \ntake it into account in ‘maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.’ 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1686.”); cf. Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (“[T]he Court in \nBostock was clear on the narrow reach of its decision and how it was limited only to Title VII \nitself.”). \n57.  The Department further “conclude[d] that the interpretation set forth in this \ndocument is most consistent with the purpose of Title IX, which is to ensure equal opportunity \nand to protect individuals from the harms of sex discrimination.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 32,639. \n58.  The Department also noted that the “U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights \nDivision has concluded that Bostock’s analysis applies to Title IX.”  Id. \n59.  The Department failed to mention that, just two months before the DOJ reached \nthat conclusion about Bostock, it had reached the exact opposite conclusion.  U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice, Memorandum for the Civil Rights Division Regarding Application of Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty 4 (Jan. 17, 2021) (“Bostock does not require any changes to . . . sex-specific facilities or \npolicies.”) (attached as Exhibit B). \n60.  Finally, the Department declared that it “will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in education programs and \nactivities that receive Federal financial assistance from the Department.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 32,638. \n61.  The Department also declared that its Interpretation “will guide the Department \nin processing complaints and conducting investigations.”  Id. at 32,639. \n62.  Plaintiffs operate and are home to programs and activities subject to Title IX, and \nthus the Department has pledged to enforce its Title IX interpretation against Plaintiffs.  \n12 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 12 of 38   PageID #: 12\n\n63.  Second, on June 23, 2021, Acting Assistant Secretary Suzanne B. Goldberg issued \na “Dear Educator” letter notifying Title IX recipients of the Department’s new Interpretation and \nreiterating that the Department “will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity.”  Letter to Educators on Title IX’s 49th Anniversary (June \n23, 2021), https://bit.ly/3ksLLDj.   \n64.  The Dear Educator letter was accompanied by a “fact sheet” issued by the Civil \nRights Division of the DOJ and the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) at the Department of \nEducation.    U.S.  Dep’t  of  Justice  &  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ.,  Confronting  Anti-LGBTQI+ \nHarassment in Schools, https://bit.ly/3sQjZnM (together with the Dear Educator Letter, “Fact \nSheet”) (attached as Exhibit C).  \n65.  The Fact Sheet purports to provide examples of what constitutes discrimination \nunder Title IX.  \n66.  Bostock  did  not  address  any  of  the  examples  of  purported  discrimination \nidentified in the Fact Sheet. \n67.  In particular, the Fact Sheet indicates that preventing a “transgender high school \ngirl” from using the “girls’ restroom” would constitute discrimination, notwithstanding that \nBostock expressly declined to resolve any questions about bathrooms, locker rooms, or the like.  \n140 S. Ct. at 1737.   \n68.  The Fact Sheet also indicates that preventing a “transgender high school girl” \nfrom  “try[ing]  out  for  the  girls’  cheerleading  team”  would  constitute  discrimination, \nnotwithstanding that Bostock did not address athletics.   \n13 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 13 of 38   PageID #: 13\n\n69.  And the Fact Sheet suggests that failing to use a transgender student’s preferred \nname or pronouns would constitute discrimination, notwithstanding that Bostock did not address \nthat issue. \n70.  On June 7, 2021, the EEOC Chair also revised a previously issued “fact sheet” \nregarding bathrooms and gender identity.  See Fact Sheet: Facility/Bathroom Access and Gender \nIdentity, https://bit.ly/2Wq3Jh3. \n71.  On June 17, 2021, the Department and DOJ filed a statement of interest in which \nthey took the position that Title IX prohibits West Virginia from “categorically exclud[ing] \ntransgender girls from participating in single-sex sports restricted to girls.”  Statement of Interest \nof the United States at 1, B.P.J. v. W.V. State Bd. of Educ., No. 2:21-cv-00316 (S.D. W. Va. June \n17, 2021), ECF No. 42 (footnote omitted). \nD.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n72.  “Congress, in enacting Title VII, did not confer upon the EEOC authority to \npromulgate rules or regulations pursuant to that Title.”  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, \n141 (1976) (citing Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431 (1975)). \n73.  Instead, Congress granted the EEOC “authority from time to time to issue, amend, \nor rescind suitable procedural regulations to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-12(a).  \n74.  Nevertheless,  on  June  15,  2021,  the  EEOC  issued  a  “technical  assistance \ndocument”  “upon  approval  of  the  Chair  of  the  U.S.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity \nCommission.”    EEOC,  Protections  Against  Employment  Discrimination  Based  on  Sexual \nOrientation or Gender Identity (June 15, 2021), https://bit.ly/3zgP7iP (“EEOC Document”) \n(attached as Exhibit D).  \n14 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 14 of 38   PageID #: 14\n\n75.  The EEOC Document purports to reflect the EEOC’s interpretation of what \nconstitutes discrimination under Title VII in certain circumstances. \n76.  The EEOC Document is posted on the EEOC website and is entitled “Protections \nAgainst Employment Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity.”  \n77.  The EEOC Document “briefly explains the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock \nv. Clayton County and the EEOC’s established legal positions on sexual-orientation- and gender-\nidentity-related workplace discrimination issues.”  Id. \n78.  And the EEOC Document applies to “[a]pplicants for employment, employees, \nemployers covered by Title VII; related representatives and practitioners.”  Id.  \n79.  Although the EEOC Document disclaims having any legal effect or setting new \npolicy, it nevertheless purports to “explain[] what the Bostock decision means for LGBTQ+ \nworkers (and all covered workers) and for employers across the country.”  Id.  \n80.  After surveying Title VII’s general requirements, the EEOC Document purports \nto define what constitutes discrimination under Bostock in a series of questions and answers.  Id. \n81.  Bostock  did  not  identify  any  of  the  following  EEOC-defined  forms  of \n“discrimination” as discrimination under Title VII.  \n82.  First: \nMay  a  covered  employer  require  a  transgender  employee  to  dress  in \naccordance with the employee’s sex assigned at birth? \nNo.  Prohibiting a transgender person from dressing or presenting consistent with \nthat person’s gender identity would constitute sex discrimination.  \nId. \n83.  Second: \nDoes an employer have the right to have separate, sex-segregated bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, or showers for men and women? \nYes.  Courts have long recognized that employers may have separate bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, and showers for men and women, or may choose to have unisex or \nsingle-use bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers.  The Commission has taken the \n15 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 15 of 38   PageID #: 15\n\nposition that employers may not deny an employee equal access to a bathroom, \nlocker room, or shower that corresponds to the employee’s gender identity.  In \nother words, if an employer has separate bathrooms, locker rooms, or showers for \nmen and women, all men (including transgender men) should be allowed to use \nthe men’s facilities and all women (including transgender women) should be \nallowed to use the women’s facilities. \nId. \n84.  Third: \nCould use of pronouns or names that are inconsistent with an individual’s \ngender identity be considered harassment? \nYes, in certain circumstances.  Unlawful harassment includes unwelcome conduct \nthat is based on gender identity.  To be unlawful, the conduct must be severe or \npervasive when considered together with all other unwelcome conduct based on \nthe  individual’s  sex  including  gender  identity,  thereby  creating  a  work \nenvironment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or \noffensive.  In its decision in Lusardi v. Dep’t of the Army, the Commission \nexplained that although accidental misuse of a transgender employee’s preferred \nname and pronouns does not violate Title VII, intentionally and repeatedly using \nthe wrong name and pronouns to refer to a transgender employee could contribute \nto an unlawful hostile work environment. \nId. \n85.  Finally: \nCould an employer’s discriminatory action be justified by customer or client \npreferences? \nNo.  As a general matter, an employer covered by Title VII is not allowed to fire, \nrefuse to hire, or take assignments away from someone (or discriminate in any \nother way) because customers or clients would prefer to work with people who \nhave a different sexual orientation or gender identity.  Employers also are not \nallowed  to  segregate  employees  based  on  actual  or  perceived  customer \npreferences.    (For  example,  it  would  be  discriminatory  to  keep  LGBTQ+ \nemployees out of public-facing positions, or to direct these employees toward \ncertain stores or geographic areas.) \nId. \n86.  After declaring that these examples constitute actionable discrimination under \nTitle VII, even though they were not at issue in Bostock, the EEOC Document directs people to \ncontact the EEOC with any reports of discrimination, including by filing a formal charge: \nFor applicants and employees of private sector employers and state and local \ngovernment employers, the individual can contact the EEOC for help in deciding \n16 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 16 of 38   PageID #: 16\n\nwhat to do next.  If the individual decides to file a charge of discrimination with \nthe EEOC, the agency will conduct an investigation to determine if applicable \nEqual Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws have been violated.  Because an \nindividual must file an EEOC charge within 180 days of the alleged violation in \norder to take further legal action (or 300 days if the employer is also covered by \na state or local employment discrimination law), it is best to begin the process \nearly. \nId. \n87.  The EEOC Document fails to mention that, on January 17, 2021, the DOJ \nconcluded that, even after Bostock, Title VII does not prohibit sex-separated bathrooms, locker \nrooms, or dress codes because “physiological differences between men and women are relevant \nfor physical fitness standards, bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes” and those practices \nthus do not “treat similarly situated people differently.”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Memorandum for \nthe Civil Rights Division Regarding Application of Bostock v. Clayton County 4 (Jan. 17, 2021) \n(attached as Exhibit B). \n88.  On information and belief, the full EEOC did not approve the EEOC Document. \n89.  On information and belief, no other Commissioner joined Chair Burrows in \nissuing the EEOC document. \n90.  On information and belief, the full EEOC did not vote on whether to approve the \ncontents of the EEOC Document.   \n91.  On information and belief, the full EEOC did not vote on whether to issue the \nEEOC Document.  \n92.  The  EEOC  Document  nevertheless  purports  to  represent  the  EEOC’s \ninterpretation of what Title VII demands of employers subject to Title VII.  \nE.  The Department of Education and EEOC Guidance Irreparably Harms \nPlaintiffs. \n \n93.  The Department’s Interpretation states that the Department’s OCR “will fully \nenforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in \n17 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 17 of 38   PageID #: 17\n\neducation programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from the Department.”  \n86 Fed. Reg. at 32,639. \n94.  The Interpretation also states that “OCR will open an investigation of allegations \nthat an individual has been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity in education programs or activities.”  Id. \n95.  The EEOC Document purports to “explain[] what the Bostock decision means for \nLGBTQ+ workers (and all covered workers) and for employers across the country.”   \n96.  The EEOC Document also purports to “explain” the EEOC’s “established legal \npositions on LGBTQ+-related matters.”   \n97.  Private parties are relying on the EEOC Document and the Interpretation to \nchallenge Plaintiffs’ laws.  See, e.g., Compl. at ¶ 47, Curb Records, Inc. v. Lee, No. 3:21-cv-\n00500 (M.D. Tenn. June 30, 2021), ECF No. 1 (“The [EEOC] has issued guidance that makes \nclear that transgender employees must be allowed to access restroom facilities based on their \ngender identity.”); Compl. at ¶¶ 67-69, A.S. v. Lee, No. 3:21-cv-00600 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 2, \n2021), ECF No. 1 (alleging that the Department of Education “issued an official interpretation \nto clarify its enforcement authority over discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity under Title IX”). \n98.  Plaintiff the State of Tennessee maintains laws or policies that at least arguably \nconflict with the Interpretation, Fact Sheet, or EEOC Document.  See, e.g., 2021 Tenn. Pub. Acts, \nc. 40, § 1 (providing that “[a] student’s gender for purposes of participation in a public middle \nschool or high school interscholastic athletic activity or event must be determined by the \nstudent’s sex at the time of the student’s birth”); 2021 Tenn.

Other Plaintiff States also maintain laws or policies that at least arguably conflict \nwith the Interpretation, Fact Sheet, or EEOC Document.  See, e.g., Ala. Code § 16-1-52(a)(2) \n(providing that “[a] public K-12 school may not allow a biological female to participate on a \nmale team if there is a female team in a sport” or “allow a biological male to participate on a \nfemale  team”);  Alaska  Stat.  § 14.18.040  (allowing  schools  to  provide  “[s]eparate  school-\nsponsored  teams  .  . . for  each  sex”);  Ark.

Plaintiffs face a credible threat that the Department will enforce the Interpretation \nand Fact Sheet against Plaintiffs. \n101.  Plaintiffs face a credible threat that the EEOC will enforce the EEOC Document \nagainst Plaintiffs. \n102.  Plaintiffs face a credible threat that the DOJ will enforce the Department’s \nInterpretation and Fact Sheet against Plaintiffs. \n103.  Plaintiffs face a credible threat that the DOJ will enforce the EEOC Document \nagainst Plaintiffs.    \n104.  Enforcement  of  the  Department’s  Interpretation  or  Fact  Sheet  could  cause \nPlaintiffs to lose significant federal funds. \n105.  Enforcement  of  the  EEOC  Document  could  subject  Plaintiffs  to  significant \nliability.   \n106.  Plaintiffs  adopted  their  laws  and  policies,  and  established  sex-separated \nrestrooms, locker rooms, showers, residence halls, and other living facilities in reliance on their \nunderstanding that Title IX and Title VII do not prohibit those laws, policies, and practices.  This \n20 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 20 of 38   PageID #: 20\n\nunderstanding was based on longstanding Department regulations and prior guidance, including \ninitial post-Bostock guidance from the Department and the DOJ.   \n107.  The  Interpretation,  Fact  Sheet,  and  EEOC  Document  undermine  Plaintiffs’ \nreliance interests and create regulatory uncertainty for Plaintiffs and other regulated entities. \n108.  The Interpretation, Fact Sheet, and EEOC Document interfere with Plaintiffs’ \nsovereign authority to enforce and administer their laws and to carry out important government \nfunctions. \n109.  The Interpretation, Fact Sheet, and EEOC Document impose administrative costs \nand burdens on Plaintiffs and other regulated entities by forcing them to assess whether their \npolicies violate the guidance and whether to change those policies. \nCOUNT I \nDepartment of Education \nAgency Action Without Observance of Procedure Required by Law \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n110.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-109 are reincorporated herein. \n111.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity; (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short \nof statutory right; [or] (D) without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)-(D).  \n112.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are final agency actions subject \nto judicial review.  Id. § 704. \n113.  The  Department’s  Interpretation  and  Fact  Sheet  are  “rules”  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.  Id. § 701(b)(2).  \n21 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 21 of 38   PageID #: 21\n\n114.  The Department is an “agency” under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Id. \n§ 701(b)(1). \n115.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to engage in “notice and \ncomment” for legislative rules.  Id. § 553(b).  \n116.  The Department’s Interpretation and the Fact Sheet are legislative rules because \nthey “intend[] to create new law, rights or duties” and thus should have been subject to notice \nand comment.  Tenn. Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting Michigan \nv. Thomas, 805 F.2d 176, 183 (6th Cir. 1986)).  \n117.  The Interpretation and Fact Sheet “seek[] to amend, rather than merely clarify,” \nwhat Title IX requires.  Id. at 1043.  \n118.  The  Interpretation  and  Fact  Sheet  “effec[t]  a  substantive  change  in  the \nregulations” the Department has already issued—and any agency action that “adopt[s] a new \nposition inconsistent with any of the Secretary’s existing regulations” is a legislative rule \nrequiring notice and comment.  Id. at 1042 (first alteration in original; quoting Shalala v. \nGuernsey Mem’l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 100 (1995)).  \n119.  Because the Interpretation and Fact Sheet are legislative rules that were adopted \nwithout the required notice-and-comment procedures, they are unlawful and should be “set \naside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT II \nDepartment of Education \nAgency Action That Is Arbitrary and Capricious \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n120.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-119 are reincorporated herein. \n121.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n22 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 22 of 38   PageID #: 22\n\n122.  An “arbitrary and capricious regulation . . . is itself unlawful and receives no \nChevron deference.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016). \n123.  In adopting a new rule, “an agency must also be cognizant that longstanding \npolicies may have ‘engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’”  Id. \n(quoting FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)).   \n124.  Moreover, “[w]hen an agency changes its existing position, it . . . . must at least \n‘display awareness that it is changing position’ and ‘show that there are good reasons for the new \npolicy.’”  Id. at 2125-26 (quoting FCC, 556 U.S. at 515).  An “‘[u]nexplained inconsistency’ in \nagency policy ‘is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change \nfrom agency practice.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Nat’l Cable & Telecomm. Ass’n v. \nBrand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 981 (2005)).   \n125.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law because the Department disregarded the \nserious reliance interests that States and covered institutions developed on the Department’s \nlongstanding regulations allowing sex-separated living facilities and athletic teams and the \nDepartment’s prior guidance, including its initial post-Bostock guidance.   \n126.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law  because  the  Department  failed  to \nadequately acknowledge that the Interpretation and Fact Sheet were a change in position from \nits existing regulations and initial post-Bostock guidance. \n127.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law  because  the  Department  failed  to \nadequately explain its change in position or provide good reasons for its change in position. \n23 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 23 of 38   PageID #: 23\n\n128.  Because  the  Department’s  Interpretation  and  Fact  Sheet  are  arbitrary  and \ncapricious, they are unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT III \nDepartment of Education \nAgency Action That Is Contrary to Title IX \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n129.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-128 are reincorporated herein.  \n130.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . (A) . . . not in accordance with law; \n. . . [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n131.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are contrary to law and exceed \nthe Department’s statutory authority because Bostock’s interpretation of Title VII’s language is \ninapplicable to Title IX’s materially different language.  \n132.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are contrary to law because, \nproperly interpreted, Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex” does not \nencompass discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. \n133.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are contrary to law because Title \nIX and longstanding Department regulations expressly permit distinctions based on biological \nsex in certain circumstances. \n134.  Because the Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are contrary to Title IX, \nthey are unlawful and should be “set aside.”  Id. \nCOUNT IV \nDepartment of Education \nAgency Action That Violates the Spending Clause \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8 \n135.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-134 are reincorporated herein. \n24 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 24 of 38   PageID #: 24\n\n136.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are “not in accordance with law,” \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,”  5  U.S.C.  § 706(2)(A)-(C),  because  they  violate  the \nSpending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  \n137.  The Spending Clause authorizes Congress to “attach conditions on the receipt of \nfederal funds,” but the “spending power is of course not unlimited.”  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 \nU.S. 203, 206-07 (1987). \n138.  One such limit is that, “if Congress desires to condition the States’ receipt of \nfederal funds, it ‘must do so unambiguously, enabling the States to exercise their choice \nknowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.”  Id. at 207 (cleaned up) \n(quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). \n139.  Another limit is that Congress may not use its spending power to “indirectly \ncoerce[] a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 578 (2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.). \n140.  The Interpretation and Fact Sheet violate the Spending Clause because they \npurport to impose obligations on Plaintiffs that Congress did not clearly impose when it enacted \nTitle IX, contrary to the requirement that Congress must “unambiguously” notify the States of \nany conditions attached to the funds.  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17).   \n141.  The Interpretation and Fact Sheet also violate the Spending Clause because they \nplace in jeopardy a significant amount of Plaintiffs’ education-related federal funding if they \nrefuse or otherwise fail to comply with the Department’s new interpretation of Title IX, leaving \nPlaintiffs with “no real option but to acquiesce” in the interpretation.  See NFIB, 567 U.S. at 587 \n(opinion of Roberts, C.J.). \n25 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 25 of 38   PageID #: 25\n\n142.  Because the Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet violate the Spending \nClause, they are unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT V \nDepartment of Education \nAgency Action That Violates the Spending Clause and First Amendment  \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, U.S. Const. amend. I \n143.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-142 are reincorporated herein. \n144.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are “not in accordance with law,” \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because they violate the First \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and condition the receipt of federal funds on recipients \nviolating the First Amendment rights of others. \n145.  The Sixth Circuit has held that requiring a state university professor to use a \ntransgender student’s preferred pronouns violates the professor’s First Amendment rights.   See \nMeriwether, 992 F.3d at 511-12. \n146.  The Interpretation and Fact Sheet also conflict with the First Amendment’s \nprotection of religious liberty. \n147.  The Interpretation and Fact Sheet infringe on Plaintiffs’ sovereign authority to \nenact and enforce laws that protect the First Amendment rights of their citizens. \n148.  To the extent the Interpretation and Fact Sheet require Plaintiffs to adopt policies \nor engage in conduct that would infringe on First Amendment rights, the Interpretation and Fact \nSheet impose unconstitutional conditions on Plaintiffs’ receipt of federal funds.  See, e.g., Dole, \n483 U.S. at 210 (explaining that the spending power “may not be used to induce the States to \nengage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional”). \n26 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 26 of 38   PageID #: 26\n\n149.  Because  the  Department’s  Interpretation  and  Fact  Sheet  violate  the  First \nAmendment and impose unconstitutional conditions on federal funding, they are unlawful and \nshould be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT VI \nDepartment of Education \nAgency Action That Exceeds Congressional Authorization and Violates the Separation of \nPowers \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art.

The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are “not in accordance with law,” \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because they are so removed \nfrom any reasonable reading of Title IX that they amount to an unconstitutional exercise of \nlegislative power, see U.S. Const. art. I, § 1 (“All legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in . . . Congress.”). \n152.  Because the Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet exceed the Department’s \nauthority and violate separation-of-powers principles, they are unlawful and should be “set \naside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT VII \nDepartment of Education \nAgency Action That Violates the Tenth Amendment \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. amend.

The Interpretation and Fact Sheet construe Title IX in a \nmanner that intrudes on the States’ historic and traditional authority to safeguard privacy \n27 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 27 of 38   PageID #: 27\n\nexpectations in educational settings, absent any evidence that Congress intended that result.

The  EEOC  is  an  “agency”  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act.    Id. \n§ 701(b)(1). \n161.  The EEOC lacks authority to issue binding regulations.  \n162.  The EEOC only has “authority from time to time to issue, amend, or rescind \nsuitable procedural regulations to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-12(a).   \n28 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 28 of 38   PageID #: 28\n\n163.

The EEOC Document is a legislative rule because it “intends to create new law, \nrights, or duties” and thus should have been subject to notice and comment.  Tenn. Hosp. Ass’n, \n908 F.3d at 1042. \n167.  The EEOC Document “seeks to amend, rather than merely clarify,” what Title \nVII requires.  Id. at 1043 (quoting Michigan, 805 F.2d at 183). \n168.  The EEOC Chair did not submit the EEOC Document for notice and comment as \nrequired by the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n169.  The  EEOC  Chair  did  not  adhere  to  the  EEOC’s  own  regulations  about \npromulgating “significant” guidance.  29 C.F.R. §§ 1695.2, 1695.5.  \n170.

The allegations in Paragraphs 1-172 are reincorporated herein. \n174.  The EEOC Document is “not in accordance with law” and exceeds the EEOC’s \nstatutory authority, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), because Bostock’s interpretation of Title VII’s \nlanguage was limited to employment termination and did not address the myriad other forms of \nalleged discrimination the EEOC Document identifies as prohibited discrimination under Title \nVII. \n175.  The EEOC Document is contrary to law because Bostock’s reasoning does not \nsupport the Document’s flawed interpretation of Title VII.  \n176.  Because the EEOC Document is contrary to Title VII, it is unlawful and should \nbe “set aside.”  Id. § 706(2). \nCOUNT XI \nEEOC \nAgency Action That Exceeds Congressional Authorization and Violates the Separation of \nPowers \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 1 \n177.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-176 are reincorporated herein. \n178.  The EEOC Document is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because it is so removed from any reasonable reading of \nTitle VII that it amounts to an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power, see U.S. Const. art. \nI, § 1 (“All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in . . . Congress.”). \n30 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 30 of 38   PageID #: 30\n\n179.  Because  the  EEOC  Document  exceeds  the  EEOC’s  authority  and  violates \nseparation-of-powers principles, it is unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT XII \nEEOC \nAgency Action That Unlawfully Abrogates Plaintiffs’ Sovereign Immunity \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. amend. XI \n180.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-179 are reincorporated herein. \n181.  The EEOC Document is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because its flawed interpretation of Title VII constitutes \nan unlawful attempt to abrogate Plaintiffs’ sovereign immunity.   \n182.  Congress may abrogate the States’ sovereign immunity pursuant to its authority \nto enforce the Fourteenth Amendment only to remedy violations of the Constitution by the States; \nit may not substantively redefine a State’s constitutional obligations.  See City of Boerne v. \nFlores,  521  U.S.  507,  520  (1997)  (explaining  that  there  “must  be  a  congruence  and \nproportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that \nend”).   \n183.  Congress never identified any pattern of discrimination against homosexual or \ntransgender individuals by the States, let alone one that amounted to a constitutional violation. \n184.  Because the EEOC Document is an unlawful attempt to abrogate Plaintiffs’ \nsovereign immunity, it is unlawful and should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT XIII \nEEOC \nAgency Action That Violates the Tenth Amendment \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. amend. X \n185.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-184 are reincorporated herein. \n31 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 31 of 38   PageID #: 31\n\n186.  The EEOC Document is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because it violates the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.  The EEOC Document interprets Title VII to intrude on the States’ historic and \ntraditional authority to safeguard privacy expectations in the workplace, absent any evidence that \nCongress intended that result.  See U.S. Const. amend. X (“The powers not delegated to the \nUnited States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.”); Rice, 331 U.S. at 230 (explaining that Congress must make \n“clear and manifest” its purpose to supersede powers historically reserved to the States). \n187.  Because the EEOC Document is contrary to the Tenth Amendment, it is unlawful \nand should be “set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCOUNT XIV \nDepartment of Education and EEOC \nDeclaratory Judgment \n5 U.S.C. § 706, 28 U.S.C. § 2201  \n188.  The allegations in Paragraphs 1-187 are reincorporated herein. \n189.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are unlawful because they are \nlegislative rules that did not undergo notice and comment.  \n190.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are unlawful because they are \narbitrary and capricious. \n191.  The Department’s Interpretation and Fact Sheet are contrary to law because they \nviolate Title IX, Department regulations, and the Constitution. \n192.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  the  Department’s \nInterpretation and Fact Sheet are invalid and cannot be enforced against Plaintiffs. \n193.  The EEOC Document is unlawful because it exceeds the EEOC’s statutory \nauthority. \n32 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308   Document 1   Filed 08/30/21   Page 32 of 38   PageID #: 32\n\n194.  The EEOC Document is unlawful because it is a legislative rule that was adopted \nwithout notice and comment and in violation of the EEOC’s own procedures. \n195.  The EEOC Document is contrary to law because it violates Title VII and the \nConstitution.  \n196.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the EEOC Document is \ninvalid and cannot be enforced against Plaintiffs. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF AND DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT \n  Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief: \nA.  A declaratory judgment holding unlawful the Department’s Interpretation and \nFact Sheet.    \nB.

Because the Court finds that the proposed intervenors have not established standing \nwith respect to certain claims and relief sought in their proposed complaint, the Motion to Intervene \n[Doc. 51] will be DENIED IN PART. The Motion [Doc. 51] will be GRANTED IN PART and \nProposed Intervenors will be permitted to join and file their proposed complaint only insofar as it \nasserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as Plaintiffs’ Complaint [Doc. 1].  \n  Finally, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. 52] will be DENIED AS MOOT in \nlight of the Court’s Memorandum Opinion and Order [Doc. 86] granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction [Doc. 10]. \nI.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn August 30, 2021, twenty States filed a Complaint [Doc. 1] challenging the legality of \ncertain documents issued by the Department of Education (“Department”) and Equal Employment \n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) in response to the President’s “Executive Order on Preventing \nand Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.” Exec. \nOrder. No. 13988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021). First, the Department of Education \npublished an Interpretation of Title IX entitled “Enforcement of Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 with Respect to Discrimination on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity \nin Light of Bostock v. Clayton County,” 86 Fed. Reg. 32637 (June 22, 2021), and a “Dear \nEducator”  letter  notifying  those  subject  to  Title  IX  of  the  Department’s  Interpretation. \nAccompanying the letter is a Fact Sheet that expounds on the Department’s interpretation of Title \nIX (with the Dear Educator Letter, the “Fact Sheet”). Second, the EEOC issued a “Technical \nAssistance Document” relating to “Protections Against Employment Discrimination Based on \nSexual Orientation or Gender Identity” (June 15, 2021).  \nThis  lawsuit  challenges,  inter  alia,  the  validity  and  legality  of  the  Department’s \nInterpretation and Fact Sheet and the EEOC’s Technical Assistance Document. Plaintiff States \ncontend  that  Defendants’  documents  are  procedurally  and  substantively  unlawful  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the United States Constitution. [Id.]. The Complaint \nseeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and a judgment setting aside \nthe Interpretation, Fact Sheet, and Technical Assistance Document. [Id. at 33-34]. After additional \nbriefing and a hearing, the Court denied Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 49] and granted \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. 10]. [Doc. 86].  \nProposed intervenor ACSI is a Christian educational organization that serves member \nindividuals and schools from early education through collegiate level. [Doc. 51-5 at ¶ 3]. ACSI is \na non-profit corporation organized under California law, with a principal place of business in \nColorado. [Id.  at ¶ 4]. It serves approximately 2,000 member schools, with members in all fifty \n2\n   \n\nstates. [Id. at ¶ 5]. Those schools in turn serve approximately 500,000 students. [Id. at ¶ 6]. ACSI’s \nStatement of Faith takes the position that human beings are created by God “as either male or \nfemale in conformity with their biological sex.” [Id. at ¶ 12].  \n  ACSI  provides  training  and  education  resources  to  its  member  schools,  including \nprofessional and personal development tools and support functions. [Id. at ¶ 13]. It also provides \nguidance on policies and procedures and sends alerts and policy memos related to religious \neducation and religious freedom. [Id. at ¶ 17]. ACSI submits public comments on regulations that \nmay affect its member schools. [Id. at ¶ 18]. It also offers certification services for its member \nschools’ athletic directors. [Id. at ¶ 20].  \n  Through the Declaration of David Balik, USA Vice President of ACSI, [Doc. 51-5], ACSI \nsays it diverted resources to preparing and submitting a written comment in response to the \nExecutive Order. [Doc. 51-5 at ¶ 5]. The Department did not open a notice and comment period \nprior to issuing the Interpretation and Fact Sheet. [Id. at ¶ 29]. ACSI argues it lost its opportunity \nto influence the rule-making process in a meaningful way. [Id. at ¶ 30]. ACSI avers that the \nInterpretation and Fact Sheet frustrate ACSI’s mission and purpose by announcing a view of \ngender that is contrary to that espoused by ACSI and its member schools. [Id. at ¶ 32].  \n  ACSI member schools compete with public schools in at least 35 states, some of which are \nPlaintiffs in this action. [Id. at ¶ 59]. Many ACSI high school sports teams, for example, compete \nagainst public high school teams for state, conference, and district championships. [Id. at ¶ 61]. \nMany member schools themselves compete against public high schools, colleges, and universities \nto attract prospective students and host athletic events. [Id. at ¶¶ 40 & 64]. ACSI argues that the \nInterpretation and Fact Sheet put ACSI schools at a competitive disadvantage by forcing their \nfemale athletic teams to compete against public school teams that may include biological males. \n3\n   \n\n[Id. at ¶ 74]. According to ACSI, “[t]he Interpretation and Fact Sheet also make it harder for ACSI \nmember schools’ athletic teams to win games and titles compared to public schools’ female athletic \nteams with males,” imposing reputational harm on ACSI member schools. [Id. at ¶ 75]. This in \nturn will make it more difficult for ACSI schools to recruit top-tier athletes. [Id. at ¶ 76].  \n  At the time of filing their declarations, proposed intervenors A.S., C.F., and A.F. were \nminor, female student athletes. [Docs. 51-2, 51-3 & 51-4]. Each declarant is a student in Arkansas \nwho has spent many hours practicing and competing in her chosen sport(s). [Id.]. Each girl avers \nthat she has observed that boys her age have physical advantages in athletic competition and \nmentions the aggressive and/or less cooperative style of play in boys’ sports. [Doc. 51-2 at ¶¶ 28-\n30; Doc. 51-3 at ¶¶ 28-30; Doc. 51-4 at ¶¶ 24-26]. A.S., C.F., and A.F. all indicate their belief that \nallowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports will rob biological female athletes of a fair \nand safe chance to compete. [Id.].   \n  The Proposed Intervenors argue they are entitled to intervene as of right pursuant to Rule \n24(a) because (1) their motion is timely, (2) they have a substantial interest in fair and safe \ncompetition for female athletes, (3) impairment of that interest is possible if intervention is denied, \nand (4) the Plaintiff States do not adequately represent their interests because they make different \narguments and raise different issues than the Proposed Intervenors. [Doc. 51-1]. In the alternative, \nPlaintiffs argue they should be permitted to intervene because their legal issues share common \nquestions of law and fact with the main action. \n  Defendants respond that the Proposed Intervenors seek relief beyond that requested in the \nComplaint and must therefore demonstrate standing. [Doc. 63 at 11-23]. Because Proposed \nIntervenors cannot show, inter alia, a concrete injury in fact sufficient to establish standing, they \nshould not be permitted to intervene. [Id.]. Defendants also argue that the Proposed Intervenors \n4\n   \n\nhave not made certain showings required to intervene as of right. Specifically, Defendants contend \nthat (1) Proposed Intervenors have not shown they have a substantial interest in the subject matter \nof the litigation, (2) have therefore not shown the impairment of that interest, and (3) have not \nestablished that their interests are inadequately represented by the Plaintiff States. [Doc. 63 at 23-\n28; id. at 28, n. 2]. Defendants also oppose permissive intervention, arguing that even if they could \ndemonstrate standing, the Proposed Intervenor’s involvement will unduly delay the resolution of \nthe action and add unnecessary factual and procedural complexity to the case. [Id. at 31-32].  \n  In reply, Proposed Intervenors argue that they do not in fact seek relief beyond what \nPlaintiffs seek. Because they seek the same practical relief as the Plaintiff States, Proposed \nIntervenors claim that Article III standing is not required. [Doc. 66 at 12]. To the extent the Court \nregards their Proposed Complaint as a request for additional or distinct relief, Proposed Intervenors \n“clarify that they seek only overlapping relief with the state plaintiffs.” [Id. at 15]. Proposed \nIntervenors reiterate that they have shown that their interests are affected by this litigation and that \nthe States may not adequately represent those interests. [Id.].  \nII.  ANALYSIS \n  “A plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each form \nof relief that is sought.” Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S.Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017). With \nmultiple plaintiffs, at least one plaintiff must have standing as to each form of relief requested in \nthe complaint, and “[t]he same principle applies to intervenors of right.” Id. at 1651. For all relief \nthat is sought, there must be a litigant with standing, whether that litigant is an original plaintiff, \ncoplaintiff, or an intervenor of right. Id. Thus, “[a]n intervenor of right must have Article III \nstanding in order to pursue relief that is different from that which is sought by a party with \nstanding.” Id.  \n5\n   \n\n  In Town of Chester, it was unclear whether the intervenor sought the same relief as the \noriginal plaintiff or different relief, “such as a money judgment against the Town” in its own name. \nId. The complaint sought a money judgment for the plaintiff. Id.  Because it was not clear whether \nthe intervenor sought separate damages for itself or simply the same damages sought by the \nplaintiff, the Supreme Court of the United States remanded the matter. Id. at 1652. Town of Chester \nmakes clear that “[a] plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for \neach form of relief that is sought.” Id. at 1650.  \n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit does not appear to have applied \nTown of Chester to determine whether a potential intervenor seeks relief that is different from that \nrequested by the plaintiff. The Court looks, then, to decisions from other circuits in deciding this \nissue. In Wayne Land and Mineral Group, LLC v. Delaware River Basin Commission, 959 F.3d \n569 (3rd Cir. 2020), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit considered a motion \nto intervene by three Pennsylvania State Senators. The case involved the Delaware River Basin \nCompact, an agreement adopted into law by four states regarding the conservation, development, \nand control of the water resources of the Delaware River Basin. Id. at 571. An interstate agency \nwas created with authority to review and approve projects having a substantial impact on the water \nresources of the basin. Id. The Executive Director of that Commission issued a determination, \nputting people on notice that any natural gas extraction project in certain areas required approval \nfrom the Commission. Id. at 572. \n  Wayne Land and Mineral Group, LLC, owned property – some of which was in the \nDelaware River Basin – which they had purchased to access natural gas reserves via fracking. Id. \nat 572. Wayne sued the Commission, challenging the agency’s authority to regulate the company’s \nproposed fracking activities. Id. Wayne sought a declaration that the Commission did not have \n6\n   \n\njurisdiction over, or the authority to review and approve, their proposed activities. Id. Three \nPennsylvania State Senators sought to intervene as plaintiffs. Id. Their motion to intervene was \ninitially denied, but after the case was dismissed, appealed, and remanded, they again sought to \nintervene. Id. at 573. \n  The Senators’ proposed complaint sought two types of relief. First, they asked the district \ncourt to “invalidate the de facto moratorium [on fracking] and enjoin its further enforcement,” \narguing that it violated the terms of the Compact because it exceeded the scope of authority granted \nto the Commission under the Compact. Id. Second, and in the alternative, the Senators sought an \norder requiring the Commission to provide just compensation for the deprivation of the economic \nvalue of the property in question. Id. The district court denied the motion to intervene, finding the \nSenators lacked a significantly protectable interest in the litigation. Id.  \n  In their appellate briefing, the Senators downplayed their request for injunctive relief. Id. \nThey stated that “the redress or benefit” they in fact sought was a declaration that the Commission \nlacked authority under the Compact to institute a moratorium on fracking within the Basin. Id. at \n575-76. For the purposes of the standing analysis, the Third Circuit therefore assumed that the \nSenators sought declaratory relief alone. Id. at 576. The court nonetheless found differences \nbetween the relief requested by Wayne and the Senators.  \n  First, the Senators challenged the Commission’s authority under the Compact as a whole, \nnot  simply  the  section  of  the  Compact  that  the  Commission  relied  on  in  issuing  its \n“Determination,”  or  so-called  moratorium.  Id.  at  576.  Second,  the  Senators  challenged  the \nCommission’s authority to institute a moratorium on fracking in the Basin. Id. “The Senators \ntherefore seem to want a declaration not simply that the DRBC may not review Wayne’s proposed \nfracking activities, but that it may not review any firm’s fracking activities.” Id. The Third Circuit \n7\n   \n\nfound that the Senators appeared to be seeking relief different from that sought by Wayne, and \nremanded to the district court to make a determination as to standing. Id. at 575. \n  The Court has examined the Third Circuit’s decision in detail because it finds the facts and \narguments analogous to this case. As the Third Circuit did, the Court will closely examine the \nrelief requested by the Plaintiffs and compare it to that requested by the Proposed Intervenors. \nProposed Intervenors assert at least three claims that are not asserted by Plaintiff States: two Title \nIX claims and a claim under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Specifically, Count I is a Title IX \nclaim of sex discrimination for failure to provide effective accommodation under 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681;  Count  II  is  a  Title  IX  claim  for  failure  to  provide  equal  treatment,  benefits,  and \nopportunities for girls, also under 20 U.S.C. § 1681; and Count VI is a claim under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. § 601, asserting Defendants failed to prepare and make available for \npublic comment an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis before issuing the Interpretation \nand Fact Sheet. Thus, on the face of the Proposed Complaint, Proposed Intervenors press three \nclaims not pursued by Plaintiffs. \n  Next, the Court looks to the relief requested by the Proposed Intervenors. Defendants say \nProposed Intervenors seek at least two forms of relief not sought by Plaintiff States: \n4.  A declaratory judgment that Title IX and its implementing regulations do \nnot prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, \nincluding by any acts that tend to prohibit males from participating in female \nathletics. \n. . .  \n6.  In the alternative, if Title IX is deemed to prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation and gender identity, then: \na.  A declaratory judgment that, as applied to ACSI (including its current and \nfuture members) and the individual athletes, that Title IX violates constitutional \nprinciples  of  federalism,  the  Spending  Clause,  the  Tenth  Amendment,  and \nCongress’s enumerated powers . . .. \n \n[Doc. 51-6 at 62].  \n8\n   \n\n  The closest comparison in the Complaint that the Court could identify is the request for \n“[a] declaratory judgment affirming that Plaintiffs and Title IX recipients located therein may \ncontinue to separate students by biological sex in appropriate circumstances in accordance with \nTitle IX’s statutory text and longstanding Department regulations.” [Doc. 1 at 33]. The Complaint \nseeks a declaratory judgment that Title IX does not prohibit Plaintiffs from, inter alia, maintaining \nshowers, locker rooms, etc. separated by biological sex. [Id.]. Though not addressed by either \nparty, Proposed Intervenors also ask the Court to “award nominal damages and any actual \ndamages.” [Doc. 51-6 at 63].  \n  The Court is not persuaded that Proposed Intervenors seek the same practical relief as \nPlaintiff States. A careful comparison of the complaints shows that Proposed Intervenors press \ndifferent claims than Plaintiffs, seek a more expansive declaratory judgment regarding the scope \nof Title IX, and seek actual and nominal damages. First, Proposed Intervenors assert at least three \nclaims against Defendants that have no analogue in the Complaint. For example, Intervenors assert \na claim under Title IX for sex discrimination. They argue the Interpretation and Fact Sheet violate \nTitle IX by failing to provide competitive opportunities for female athletes that accommodate their \nabilities and provide equal levels of competition. [Doc. 51-6 at 47]. While Intervenors may make \nsimilar arguments about the validity of the Interpretation and Fact Sheet, unlike Plaintiffs, they are \nasserting a substantive Title IX violation, not only a challenge to the validity or legality of the \nguidance documents in view of the APA.    \n  Relatedly, Proposed Intervenors seek a more expansive declaratory judgment regarding the \nscope of Title IX: that Title IX – as a whole – does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation or gender identity. In contrast, Plaintiff States seek a declaratory judgment that, \ninter  alia,  the  States  may  continue  to  separate  students  by  biological  sex  in  appropriate \n9\n   \n\ncircumstances in accordance with Title IX. The Third Circuit’s Holding in Wayne Land & Mining \nGroup  is  instructive  here.  There,  the  intervenor-senators  challenged  the  authority  of  the \nCommission under the Compact as a whole, while the plaintiff challenged only the section of the \nCompact on which the Commission relied in issuing its determination. Similarly, Proposed \nIntervenors seek a judgment applicable to all of Title IX, while the Plaintiff States seek a \ndeclaratory judgment that Title IX does not prohibit/require certain specified conduct. Elsewhere, \nPlaintiffs do assert that “Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ does not \nencompass discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.” [Doc. 1 at ¶ 132]. But \nas in Wayne, this contention still relates to specific language in Title IX. So it is still narrower than \nthe relief Proposed Intervenors seek. See Wayne, 959 F.3d at 576 (finding plaintiff’s relief related \nto specific agency determination and its impact on plaintiff, while proposed intervenors sought \ndeclaration regarding agency authority under the Compact as a whole and as to any impacted \nfracking firm).  \n  Finally, Proposed Intervenors seek actual and nominal damages. This request presumably \narises out of their claims for substantive violations of Title IX.1 Unlike the facts in Town of \nChester, there is no question of overlap with the Complaint, as Plaintiffs do not seek money \ndamages. That Proposed Intervenors are, as a practical matter, seeking some of the same relief as \nPlaintiffs does not relieve them of the obligation to demonstrate standing for relief that goes \nbeyond the Complaint. There is no question that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for “each \nclaim” he asserts and “for each form of relief sought.” Town of Chester, 137 S. Ct. at 1650. \nProposed Intervenors’ Complaint asserts claims not made by Plaintiff States, seeks a broader \n \n1 “[T]he Administrative Procedure Act expressly excludes ‘money damages’ from the ‘relief’ available against the \nUnited States.” Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 294 n.2 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); Armendariz-Mata v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 82 F.3d 1996 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding sovereign immunity not waived under 5 U.S.C. § 702 of \nthe APA when the substance of the complaint at issue is a claim for money damages).  \n10\n   \n\ndeclaratory judgment regarding Title IX, and seeks actual and nominal damages. These claims and \nrelief are different than that requested in the Complaint and, accordingly, Proposed Intervenors \nmust establish they have Article III standing. \n  To show Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an injury in fact; (2) \nthat the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant; and (3) that the injury \nwill likely be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-\n61 (1992). The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements. \nId. at 561. Proposed Intervenors do not address the elements of standing.2 \n  Instead, they disclaim any request for relief that the Court construes as distinct from \nPlaintiffs’ requests. [Doc. 66 at 15]. They also argue that if the Court finds they lack standing as \nto certain claims or requests for relief, they be permitted to intervene as to relief that overlaps with \nthat requested by Plaintiffs. [Id. at 11]. Wayne Land and Mineral Group is again instructive. There, \nthe proposed intervenors requested an injunction, but on appeal, represented that the relief they \nsought was a declaratory judgment. 959 F.3d at 576-77. For the purpose of the standing analysis, \nthe court therefore assumed that the Senators sought declaratory relief alone. Id. at 576. While the \ncourt ultimately found that the Senators sought relief beyond that sought by Plaintiffs, its analysis \nwas based on the Senators’ representation that they only sought declaratory relief. Relatedly, in \nSherman v. Town of Chester, 339 F. Supp. 3d 346, 358 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), the court found that the \nproposed intervenor sought relief that was different from that sought by the plaintiff – specifically, \na money judgment in its own name – and lacked standing to do so. It therefore denied the motion \nto intervene as to the cause of action that exceeded the scope of the complaint, but otherwise \n \n2 In arguing that they have a substantial and legally protectable interest in this litigation, Proposed Intervenors do \nmention several types of standing, including competitor standing. [Doc. 51-1 at 20-21]. They do not, however, flesh \nout this argument by showing that each requirement for Article III standing is met. \n11\n   \n\npermitted intervention.  Id. at 357 (“[Intervenor] may join and file the Proposed  Intervenor \nComplaint only insofar as it does not state a claim for damages in [its] own name.”).   \n  The Court finds that Proposed Intervenors have failed to establish standing as to the claims \nand requests for relief that go beyond Plaintiffs’ Complaint. Specifically, Proposed Intervenors \nhave failed to establish that they have standing to bring the following causes of action: Count I, \nsex discrimination for failure to provide effective accommodation under 20 U.S.C. § 1681; \nCount II, failure to provide equal treatment, benefits, and opportunities for girls under 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681; and Count VI, violation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. § 601. The Court \nfurther finds that Proposed Intervenors have not established standing to seek the relief requested \nin ¶¶ 4 and 6 of their Prayer for Relief [Doc. 51-6 at 62], to the extent these requests are broader \nthan the declaratory judgment sought by Plaintiffs. Finally, Proposed Intervenors have not shown \nstanding to seek actual and nominal damages. The Motion to Intervene [Doc. 51] is DENIED IN \nPART as to these claims and requests for relief. \n  To the extent Proposed Intervenors seek relief that overlaps with Plaintiffs’ Complaint, the \nCourt will grant the motion for permissive intervention pursuant to Rule 24(b). Rule 24(b) allows \nthe Court to “permit anyone to intervene who . . . has a claim or defense that shares with the main \naction a common question or law or fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1). As pleaded, Proposed \nIntervenors have sought relief beyond that in the Complaint without establishing standing, so they \ncannot intervene as to those claims / requests for relief. But they also seek relief and assert causes \nof action that overlap with – and in some cases are identical to – those pleaded in the Complaint. \nExactly like Plaintiffs, they seek a declaratory judgment that the Department lacked authority to \nissue the Interpretation and Fact Sheet [Doc. 51-6 at ¶ 2] and a judgment setting aside and vacating \nthe Interpretation and Fact Sheet [Id. at ¶ 3]. And while they seek a broader declaration as to Title \n12\n   \n\nIX, that necessarily encompasses the Plaintiffs’ request for a declaration that Title IX permits \nseparation by biological sex in appropriate circumstances. [Id. at ¶ 4]. Indeed, Plaintiffs seek a \njudgment that Title IX does not prohibit Plaintiffs and Title IX recipients from maintaining athletic \nteams separated by biological sex or from  assigning an individual to a team based on the \nindividual’s  biological  sex.  This  is  the  primary  focus  of  Proposed  Intervenor’s  complaint. \nProposed Intervenors thus have claims that share common questions of law and fact with Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint and will be permitted to intervene to the extent that their claims and requests for relief \noverlap with Plaintiffs’. \n  Finally,  the  Court  finds  that,  once  properly  limited  to  supporting  Plaintiffs’  claims, \nProposed Intervenors’ participation in this litigation will not unduly delay this action or prejudice \nthe adjudication of the rights of the original parties. See Purnell v. City of Akron, 925 F.2d 941, \n951 (6th Cir. 1991) (reversing denial of permissive intervention). Defendants argue that Proposed \nIntervenors’ participation will add factual and legal complexity to this case. [Doc. 63 at 32]. For \nexample, Defendants expect Proposed Intervenors to introduce factual questions such as whether \ntransgender girls have a competitive advantage over biological girls in athletics and whether \nbiological girls face a greater risk of injury when competing against transgender girls. [Id.]. Denial \nof Intervenor’s direct Title IX claims, however, is likely to reduce or eliminate the significance of \nthese admittedly complex factual issues.      \n  However, due to the complexity of the issues presented in this litigation, Intervenors must \nsubmit a complaint that comports with this Order. Reimagining Intervenor’s complaint so that it \noverlaps with Plaintiffs’ claims and requests for relief would be impractical and inefficient as this \nlitigation proceeds. Proposed Intervenors have represented to the Court that they do not seek relief \nbeyond that sought by Plaintiffs, and have disavowed any relief that goes beyond Plaintiffs’ \n13\n   \n\nComplaint. The Court has found that they lack standing to assert certain claims and seek certain \nforms of relief, as explained above. Proposed Intervenors will therefore be required to file a \ncomplaint in accordance with this Memorandum Opinion and their representations to the Court. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  Accordingly, the Motion to Intervene [Doc. 51] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED \nIN PART as follows: \n(cid:120)  The Motion to Intervene [Doc. 51] is DENIED as to Proposed Intervenors’ requests \nfor relief that exceed the scope of Plaintiffs’ Complaint. Specifically, intervention is \ndenied as to: \no  Count I, sex discrimination for failure to provide effective accommodation in \nviolation of 20 U.S.C. § 1681; \no  Count II, failure to provide equal treatment, benefits, and opportunities for \ngirls in violation of 20 U.S.C. § 1681;  \no  Count VI under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. § 601; \no  Prayer for Relief ¶¶ 4 and 6, to the extent the requested declarations exceed \nPlaintiffs’ request for declaratory judgment regarding Title IX; \no  Prayer for Relief ¶ 8, for nominal damages and any actual damages. \n(cid:120)  The  Motion  to  Intervene  [Doc.  51]  is  otherwise  GRANTED  pursuant  to  Rule \n24(b)(1). \n  It is FURTHER ORDERED that Intervenors SHALL FILE a complaint in accordance \nwith this Order on or before September 21, 2022. Intervenors are put ON NOTICE that any \ncomplaint filed that is not limited as set forth in this Order will be stricken. \n  Finally, because the Court granted Plaintiff States’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \n14\n   \n\nwhich Intervenors joined in and adopted, Intervenor-Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n[Doc. 52] is DENIED AS MOOT. \nSO ORDERED.\nCCHHAARRLLEESS  EE..

The \nrelevant issues have been fully briefed, and the Court heard oral argument. These motions are now \nripe for review.  \n  For  the  reasons  below,  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  [Doc.  10]  is \nGRANTED and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 49] is DENIED. \n \n1 Plaintiff States consist of Tennessee, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and \nWest Virginia.  \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 1 of 47   PageID #: 1942\n\nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Bostock v. Clayton County  \nIn Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court of the United States was asked to resolve \na  discrete  legal  issue:  whether  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  which  prohibits \nemployment discrimination “because of…sex,” bars an employer from firing someone simply for \nbeing homosexual or transgender. 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1738-39 (2020). The Court answered this \nquestion affirmatively.  \nThe Court explained that Title VII’s “because of…sex” language incorporates a “but-for” \ncausation standard; so long as “sex” was one “but-for” cause of an employee’s termination, that is \nsufficient to trigger Title VII. Id. at 1739. The Court further explained that “sex” refers to the \nbiological distinctions between males and females. Id. Taken together, the Court clarified that \n“[a]n employer violates Title VII when it intentionally fires an individual employee based in part \non sex.” Id. at 1741.  \nThe Court then reasoned that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being \nhomosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” Id. \n“[H]omosexuality  and  transgender  status  are  inextricably  bound  up  with  sex”  because  “to \ndiscriminate on these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees \ndifferently because of their sex.” Id. at 1742. The Court held that, under Title VII, “employers      \nare prohibited from firing employees on the basis of homosexuality or transgender status.” Id. at \n1753. \nThe Court was careful to narrow the scope of its holding. Id. That is, its holding did not \n“sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination.” Id. Nor \ndid the Court’s decision “purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, [dress codes] or anything \n  2 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 2 of 47   PageID #: 1943\n\nelse of the kind.” Id. The Court expressly declined to “prejudge” any laws or issues not before it, \nobserving instead that “[w]hether policies and practices might or might not qualify as unlawful \ndiscrimination or find justifications under other provisions of Title VII are questions for future \ncases.” Id.  \nB.  Executive Order \nOn January 20, 2021, the President of the United States signed an “Executive Order on \nPreventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.” \nExec. Order. No. 13988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021) (herein “President’s Executive \nOrder”). Under the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Bostock, the Executive Order declared that “laws \nthat prohibit sex discrimination…prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual \norientation.” Id. (citing Bostock, 140 S. Ct. 1731). The President directed federal agencies to “fully \nimplement  statutes  that  prohibit  sex  discrimination”  consistent  with  the  Administration’s \ninterpretation. Id.  \nC. Agency Response to Executive Order \nIn  response  to  the  President’s  Executive  Order,  the  Department  of  Education \n(“Department”) and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued guidance \ndocuments providing their interpretations of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of        \n1972 (“Title IX”) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), respectively. \n1.  Department of Education \nDefendant United States Department of Education is an executive agency of the federal \ngovernment responsible for the enforcement and administration of Title IX. [Doc. 1 at ¶ 17] (citing \n20 U.S.C. §§ 3411, 3441). \n  3 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 3 of 47   PageID #: 1944\n\nOn June 22, 2021, the Department published in the Federal Register an “Interpretation” of \nTitle IX. [Doc. 1-2] (“Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With \nRespect to Discrimination on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. \nClayton County.” 86 Fed. Reg. 32637 (June 22, 2021)). The Interpretation took effect upon \npublication. [Id.]. The Department recognized that the Interpretation represented a change in \nposition, explaining the purpose of the Interpretation was “to make clear that the Department \ninterprets Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to encompass discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity” in light of the Bostock decision. [Id.]. The Interpretation \nstates that the Department “will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity in education programs and activities that receive Federal financial \nassistance  from  the  Department”  and  that the  Interpretation  “will  guide  the  Department  in \nprocessing complaints and conducting investigations.” [Id.]. The Interpretation “supersedes and \nreplaces any prior inconsistent statements made by the Department regarding the scope of Title \nIX’s jurisdiction over discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.” [Id.]. \nSubsequently, on June 23, 2021, the Department issued a “Dear Educator” letter to directly \nnotify  those  subject  to  Title  IX  of  the  Department’s  Interpretation.  [Doc.  1-4]  (“Letter  to   \nEducators  on  Title  IX’s  49th  Anniversary”  (June  23,  2021)).2  The  “Dear  Educator”  letter   \nreiterates  that  “Title  IX’s  protection  against  sex  discrimination  encompasses  discrimination     \nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity” and explains that the Department “will fully \nenforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.”      \n[Id.].  \n \n2 https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/educator-202106-tix.pdf (last visited July \n15, 2022). \n \n  4 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 4 of 47   PageID #: 1945\n\nThe “Dear Educator” letter references an accompanying “Fact Sheet” that expounds on    \nthe Department’s interpretation of Title IX. [Doc. 1-4] (“U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc.,  Confronting  Anti-LGBTQI+  Harassment  in  Schools”  (June  2021)).3  The  Fact Sheet \nexplains that “discrimination against students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity \nis a form of discrimination prohibited by federal law.” [Id.]. The Fact Sheet also notes that \nregulated entities “have a responsibility to investigate and address sex discrimination, including \nsexual harassment, against students because of their perceived or actual sexual orientation or \ngender identity.” [Id.]. The Fact Sheet states that the Department “can [] provide information to \nassist schools in meeting their legal obligations,” and offers examples of specific conduct related \nto sexual orientation and gender identity that the Department can investigate as incidents of \ndiscrimination under Title IX. [Id.].  \n2.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  \nDefendant Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a federal agency charged with \nlimited enforcement of, among other things, Title VII. [Doc. 1 at ¶ 19] (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n6).  \nOn June 15, 2021, the EEOC issued a “Technical Assistance Document.” [Doc. 1-5] \n(“Protections  Against  Employment  Discrimination  Based  on  Sexual  Orientation  or  Gender \nIdentity” (June 15, 2021)).4 The Technical Assistance Document “explains what the Bostock \ndecision means for LGBTQ+ workers (and all covered workers) and for employers across the \ncountry” and “explains the [EEOC’s] established legal positions on LGBTQ+ related matters.”    \nId.  \n \n3 https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-tix-202106.pdf (last visited July 15, 2022). \n \n4 https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/protections-against-employment-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-or-\ngender (last visited July 15, 2022). \n  5 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 5 of 47   PageID #: 1946\n\nAfter summarizing Title VII’s general requirements, the Technical Assistance Document \nprovides examples of employer conduct that would constitute discrimination under Bostock \nthrough a series of questions and answers. Id. Specifically, the Technical Assistance Document \npurports to explain employers’ obligations with respect to dress codes, bathrooms, locker rooms, \nshowers, and use of preferred pronouns or names. [Id.]. The Technical Assistance Document \ncautions that it “does not have the force and effect of law and is not meant to bind the public in \nany way.” [Id.]. Instead, the Technical Assistance Document is “intended only to provide clarity \nto the public regarding existing requirements under the law.” [Id.]. The Technical Assistance \nDocument invites individuals to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC if they believe   \ntheir rights under Title VII, as explained within the document, have been violated. [Id.].  \nD. Current Lawsuit \nPlaintiff States are employers subject to the requirements of Title VII, and are home to \npolitical subdivisions and other employers subject to the requirements of Title VII. [Doc. 1 at ¶¶ \n8-9,  15-16].5  Plaintiff  States  also  oversee  and  operate  educational  institutions  and  other \neducational programs and activities that receive federal funding and are thus subject to the \nrequirements of Title IX. [Id. at ¶¶ 12, 15]. \nOn August 30, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint challenging the legality of the guidance \ndocuments issued by the Department and the EEOC in response to the President’s Executive         \nOrder. [Id.]. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ guidance documents are procedurally \nand substantively unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the United States \n \n5 For consistency and ease of reference, record citations are to the CM/ECF-stamped document and page number, not \nto the internal pagination of any filed document. Where possible, citation is made to more specific subdivisions within \na document. \n  6 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 6 of 47   PageID #: 1947\n\nConstitution. [Id.]. Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief and \na judgment setting aside Defendants’ guidance documents. [Id. at 33-34].  \nOn September 2, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. 10], \nrequesting the Court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the challenged guidance documents until \nthis case is resolved on the merits. Defendants then filed a Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 49], seeking \ndismissal of this action in its entirety. Defendants claim (1) the Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ claims and (2) Plaintiffs fail to state plausible claims for relief. \n[Id.].  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n  Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits a party to seek injunctive relief    \nto prevent immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage. The purpose of a preliminary \ninjunction is to preserve the respective positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be \nheld. Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); Certified Restoration Dry Clean \nNetwork, LLC v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 542 (6th Cir. 2007).  \n  Whether to issue a preliminary injunction is committed to the sound discretion of the trial \ncourt. Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Mich. Brick, Inc., 679 F.2d 100, 102 (6th Cir. 1982). A \npreliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy” that “may only be awarded upon \na clear showing that the [moving party] is entitled to such relief.” Fowler v. Benson, 924 F.3d 247, \n256 (6th Cir. 2019) (internal citations omitted). “[T]he party seeking a preliminary injunction bears \nthe burden of justifying such relief.” Am. Civil Liberties Union Fund of Mich. v. Livingston Cnty., \n796 F.3d 636, 642 (6th Cir. 2015); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b). \n  In the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, four factors determine when a \ncourt should grant a preliminary injunction: “(1) whether the movant has shown a likelihood of \n  7 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 7 of 47   PageID #: 1948\n\nsuccess  on  the  merits; (2)  whether the  moving  party  will  be irreparably  injured  absent  an \ninjunction; (3) whether issuing an injunction will harm other parties to the litigation; and (4) \nwhether an injunction is in the public interest.” Vitolo v. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 360 (6th Cir. \n2021) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009)). These four factors are “to be balanced” \nagainst one another; they are “not prerequisites that must be met.” Michael v. Futhey, 2009 WL \n4981688, at *17 (6th Cir. Dec. 17, 2009).  \n  Furthermore, “in addition to demonstrating a likelihood of success on the substantive \nclaims, a plaintiff must also show a likelihood of success of establishing jurisdiction.” Memphis \nA. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, 2 F.4th 548, 554 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing Waskul v. Washtenaw \nCnty. Cmty. Mental Health, 900 F.3d 250, 256 n.4 (6th Cir. 2018)). “If a plaintiff cannot show        \na likelihood of jurisdiction, then the court will deny the preliminary injunction.” Id. (explaining \nthat there is no continuing need for a preliminary injunction when there is not a substantial \nlikelihood that the claims will remain justiciable).  \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nAs an initial matter, there is substantial overlap between the pending motions. Defendants \ncontend Plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction for the same reasons this action \nshould be dismissed. Because Defendants’ arguments in opposition to the requested injunctive \nrelief are identical to their arguments for dismissal, the Court will resolve both motions in the \ncontext of determining whether a preliminary injunction is warranted. Hils v. Davis, 2022 WL \n769509, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 14, 2022) (collecting cases) (“Because Defendants’ position on \nPlaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits is identical to their motion to dismiss, the Court     \nwill analyze these questions together.”); Austin v. United Auto Workers Intern. Union, 2004 WL \n2112730, at *2-3 (E.D. Mich. June 4, 2004) (holding that plaintiff’s failure to demonstrate a \n  8 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 8 of 47   PageID #: 1949\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits also signified a failure to state a claim sufficient to survive a \nmotion to dismiss).  \nA.   Jurisdiction  \n  Plaintiffs maintain that their claims are justiciable, [Doc. 11 at 16-18], while Defendants \ncontend the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. [Doc. 48 at 26-34]. Specifically, Defendants \nargue that Plaintiffs lack standing and their claims are not yet ripe for review. [Id.].6  \n1.  Standing \n  Article III of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to   \nactual cases and controversies. U.S. Const. art. III, § 2; Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 559-60 (1992). “Standing is a core component of this ‘case or controversy requirement of \nArticle III.’” Memphis A. Philip Randolph Inst., 2 F.4th at 555 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). \nStanding is a “threshold question in every federal case” that asks “whether the plaintiff is [a] proper \nparty to bring [a particular lawsuit].” Coyne v. American Tobacco Co., 183 F.3d 488, 496 (6th Cir. \n1999); Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997). Standing ensures that the plaintiff has a sufficient \n“personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant the invocation of federal court \njurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court’s remedial powers on [their] behalf.” Lugo v. Miller, \n640 F.2d 823, 827 (6th Cir. 1981).  \n  “[T]he presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s case or \ncontroversy requirement.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst’l Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 \n \n6 Defendants also contend that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA claims because Plaintiffs have an \nadequate alternative remedy available to them. [Doc. 49-1 at 16-19]. However, “[b]ecause the APA is not a \njurisdiction-conferring statute, ‘[the] elements of a claim under the APA…are not jurisdictional.’” Haines v. Fed. \nMotor Carrier Safety Admin., 814 F.3d 417, 424 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Jama v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 760 F.3d \n490, 494 (6th Cir. 2014)). While there are threshold questions under the APA, such questions speak to the failure to \nstate a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) rather than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). Id. at 424-27 \n(“To state a claim for relief under the APA, a plaintiff must allege that his or her injury stems from a final agency \naction for which there is no other adequate remedy in court.”) \n  9 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 9 of 47   PageID #: 1950\n\n(2006); Phillips v. Snyder, 836 F.3d 707, 714 n.2 (6th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases). To satisfy \nArticle III’s standing requirement, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) it has suffered an injury in fact; \n(2) that injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant; and (3) that the injury \nwill likely be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61; Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, \n136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (summarizing the standing elements as: (1) injury in fact; (2) \ntraceability; and (3) redressability). To obtain injunctive relief, a plaintiff “must show actual \npresent harm or a significant possibility of future harm.” Grendell v. Ohio Supreme Court, 252 \nF.3d 828, 832 (6th Cir. 2001).  \n  As a threshold matter, it is of great significance that Plaintiffs are sovereign States, as States \nconstitute a special class of litigants for federal jurisdictional purposes. Massachusetts v. EPA, 127 \nS. Ct. 1438, 1453-54 (2007). In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court noted “[i]t is of considerable \nrelevance that the party seeking review here is a sovereign State and not…a private individual.” \nId. at 1454. “States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,” thus, \nPlaintiff States are entitled to “special solicitude” in the Court’s standing analysis. Id. at 1454-55; \nsee also Arizona v. Biden, 2022 WL 2437870, at *5 (6th Cir. July 5, 2022) (quoting Massachusetts, \n127 S. Ct. 1438) (explaining “States sometimes are entitled to ‘special solicitude’…because they \nmay  incur  ‘quasi-sovereign’  injuries  that  private  parties  cannot.”).  However,  any  “special \nsolicitude” afforded to States does not eliminate the core standing requirements of an injury in \nfact, causation, and redressability. Id. at 1455-59; Arizona, 2022 WL 2437870 at *5. \n  Here, the primary dispute centers around the injury in fact requirement. “A plaintiff    \nsuffers an ‘injury in fact’ when [their] legally protected interest has been invaded and the injury    \nis both ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent;’ not ‘conjectural or hypothetical.’” \nKiser v. Reitz, 765 F.3d 601, 607 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). Plaintiffs \n  10 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 10 of 47   PageID #: 1951\n\nidentify several injuries inflicted by the challenged guidance. [Doc. 11 at 17]. During oral \nargument, Plaintiffs represented that the alleged injury to their sovereign interests is the most direct \ninjury that confers standing. The Court agrees.  \n  It is well-established that “[S]tates have a sovereign interest in ‘the power to create and \nenforce a legal code.’” Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, \n601-02 (1982); see also Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986) (“[A] State clearly has a \nlegitimate interest in the continued enforceability of its own statutes.”). Pursuant to that interest, \ncourts have recognized that States suffer a cognizable injury for purposes of constitutional standing \nwhen they allege an intrusion on their ability to enforce their own legal code, whether by way of \ndirect interference or interference analogous to substantial pressure to change state laws. Id. 7  \n  Plaintiffs contend they are presently injured by Defendants’ guidance documents, as the \nguidance directly interferes with Plaintiffs’ sovereign authority to enforce state laws. [Doc. 11 at \n17]. Plaintiffs claim they have exercised their sovereign authority to enact laws that “arguably \n \n7 See also Cameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Center, P.S.C., 142 S.

Plaintiffs argue that based on Defendants’ guidance, conduct \nrequired under their state laws constitutes sex discrimination under Titles VII and IX. [Doc. 11 at \n18]. Therefore, Plaintiffs claim Defendants’ interpretations of Titles VII and IX, as set forth in the \nchallenged guidance, directly interfere with and threaten their ability to enforce their state laws as \nwritten. [Docs. 1 at ¶ 108; 11 at 17].  \n  It is well-settled that Plaintiffs have a concrete interest in the continued enforceability         \nof their state laws, and ten Plaintiff States have identified a plausible conflict between their state    \nlaws and Defendants’ guidance documents. Plaintiffs have enacted, and are currently enforcing, \nstatutes that arguably conflict with Defendants’ guidance as to the legality of certain conduct \nrelated to sexual orientation and gender identity.  \n  For example, Tennessee has a statute providing “[a] student’s gender for purposes of \nparticipation in a public middle school or high school interscholastic athletic activity or event    \nmust be determined by the student’s sex at the time of the student’s birth.” [Id. at ¶ 98].8 Yet, the \nDepartment’s  Fact  Sheet,  which  purports  to  explain  existing  obligations  under  Title  IX,    \nhighlights that students should be allowed to participate on a sports team consistent with their \ngender identity, rather than biological sex. [Doc. 1-4]. Tennessee also has a statute providing \npublic school students, teachers, and employees with a cause of action against a school that \n“‘intentionally allow[s] a member of the opposite sex to enter [a] multi-occupancy restroom or \nchanging facility while other persons [are] present.” [Id. at ¶ 98].9 In contrast, the Department’s \n \n8 Similarly, Plaintiffs Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, and Montana have enacted laws providing that designations for \nschool-sponsored athletic activities must be determined by biological sex. [Doc. 1 at ¶ 99].  \n9 Similarly, Plaintiffs Nebraska, Oklahoma, and West Virginia have enacted laws that provide for sex-separated \nfacilities in the educational and employment contexts and prohibit members of the opposite sex from using those \nfacilities. [Id.].  \n \n  12 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 12 of 47   PageID #: 1953\n\nFact Sheet notes that students should be allowed to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender \nidentity, and the EEOC’s Technical Assistance Document provides that covered employers must \nallow an individual to access a bathroom, locker room, or shower that corresponds to their gender \nidentity. [Docs. 1-4, 1-5].  \n   At a minimum, Defendants’ guidance appears to deem conduct required by Plaintiffs’   \nstate laws to be unlawful sex discrimination under federal law. And, because Plaintiffs are     \nsubject to Titles VII and IX, and are thus objects of the guidance, Defendants’ guidance directly \ninterferes  with  and  threatens  Plaintiff  States’  ability  to  continue  enforcing  their  state  laws. \nPlaintiffs cannot continue regulating pursuant to their state laws while simultaneously complying      \nwith Defendants’ guidance. \n  Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that they are currently injured by Defendants’ guidance \ndocuments, as the guidance puts substantial pressure on Plaintiffs to change state laws.10 Plaintiffs \nhave identified a conflict between Defendants’ guidance and what their state laws require, and the \nguidance applies to Plaintiffs. Defendants have vowed to enforce these statues consistent with the \nchallenged guidance, and Defendants do not dispute that an enforcement action puts Plaintiffs at \nrisk of losing substantial federal funding. Defendants have the power and ability to investigate \n“sex discrimination” and to enforce the guidance against Plaintiffs, and Defendants have not \ndisavowed doing so. Therefore, as it currently stands, Plaintiffs must choose between the threat of \nlegal consequences—enforcement action, civil penalties, and the withholding of federal funding – \nor altering their state laws to ensure compliance with the guidance and avoid such adverse action. \nAs other courts have recognized, being left to such an untenable choice inflicts substantial pressure \non Plaintiffs to change their state laws—an intrusion sufficient to constitute an injury for standing \n \n10 Plaintiffs alleged this injury in their Complaint and further developed their argument regarding this injury during \noral argument. [Doc. 1 at ¶¶108-109].  \n  13 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 13 of 47   PageID #: 1954\n\npurposes. Supra at n.7. \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ alleged interference with their sovereign authority to \ncreate and enforce a legal code cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court’s decision in \nMassachusetts v. Mellon, which explained that Article III jurisdiction cannot be based upon \n“abstract questions…of sovereignty.” [Doc. 48 at 29]. (citing 262 U.S. 477, 485 (1923)). In \nMellon, the Supreme Court rejected Massachusetts’s assertion that a sovereign state has an \nabsolute right to sue on its own behalf. Id. at 484-85. Massachusetts sued to challenge the \nconstitutionality of the Maternity Act, arguing the statute was an improper usurpation of power \nreserved to the states. Id. Id. at 480-81. The Court first highlighted that the powers of the states \nwere not actually invaded, as the Act “imposes no obligation but simply extends an option which \nthe state is free to accept or reject.” Id. at 480-82. The Court then noted that the dispute did not \ninvolve “rights of person or property,” “rights of dominion over physical domain,” or “quasi \nsovereign rights actually invaded or threatened,” but instead involved “abstract questions of \npolitical power, of sovereignty, of government.” Id. at 485. Thus, because “[n]o rights of the state \nfalling within the scope of the judicial power” were presented for adjudication, Massachusetts \ncould not invoke the power of the judiciary to pass judgment on the validity of the Maternity       \nAct. Id.  \n  The Sixth Circuit recently expounded on Mellon, clarifying that “[t]here is [] no Mellon \nbar against the plaintiff states’ suit in their sovereign and quasi-sovereign capacities.” Kentucky    \nv. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 597-98 (6th Cir. 2022). So, in other words, when sovereign and quasi-\nsovereign interests are actually invaded or threatened, a State may sue the United States to \nvindicate its own rights. Id. at 596-98 (concluding that “Mellon likely does not bar the state \nplaintiffs’ claims to the extent they assert sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests”); see also \n  14 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 14 of 47   PageID #: 1955\n\nMassachusetts, 127 S. Ct. at 1455, n.17 (2007) (citing Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. \n439, 447 (1945) (“[T]here is a critical difference between allowing a State ‘to protect her citizens \nfrom the operation of federal statutes’ (which is what Mellon prohibits) and allowing a State to \nassert its [own] rights under federal law (which it has standing to do).”) \n   Here, unlike in Mellon, Plaintiff States have identified a specific sovereign interest at \nstake—the power to create and enforce a legal code—and further identified plausible conflicts \nbetween Defendants’ guidance documents and their own state laws to demonstrate that their \nsovereign interests are actually invaded or threatened. As such, the Court is asked to resolve a \n“concrete” controversy, rather than an “abstract question[]…of sovereignty” like Defendants \nsuggest. \n  Further, Defendants contend Plaintiffs’ standing argument is undermined by the Sixth \nCircuit’s decision in Arizona v. Biden. [Doc. 78 at 2] (citing 31 F.4th 469 (6th Cir. 2022)). In \nArizona, the Sixth Circuit determined that three States failed to demonstrate an injury in fact \nbecause the challenged guidance did “not directly injure the States. It [did] not regulate the States \nby telling them what they [could] or [could not] do in their jurisdiction.” 31 F.4th at 474. Instead, \nthe guidance merely regulated the actions of third-party federal employees by telling them what to \nprioritize in enforcing federal immigration law. Id. Additionally, the Sixth Circuit noted the States \ndid not allege an injury to a sovereign interest traditionally recognized by courts, such as the \n“regulation of them as States, or preemption of local lawmaking authority.” Id. at 476. Instead, the \nStates merely claimed an injury in fact based on “indirect fiscal burdens allegedly flowing from \nthe [guidance].” Id.  \n  This  case  is  distinguishable.  Unlike  in  Arizona,  Plaintiffs  are  challenging  guidance \ndocuments that directly apply to them. As employers and operators of educational institutions, \n  15 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 15 of 47   PageID #: 1956\n\nPlaintiffs are subject to the requirements of Titles VII and IX and, thus, are objects of the \nchallenged guidance documents. Supra at 12-13. Therefore, the challenged guidance documents \n“regulate the States by telling them what they can or cannot do” within their jurisdiction with \nrespect to their treatment of individuals based on sexual orientation and gender identity. 31        \nF.4th  at  474.  Unlike  in  Arizona,  Plaintiffs  have  asserted  an  injury  to  a  sovereign  interest \ntraditionally recognized by courts—the power to create and enforce a legal code. Supra at 11. In \nlight of these distinctions, the Court finds that Arizona does not undermine Plaintiffs’ standing \nargument. \n  For  the  reasons  above,  the  Court  finds  that  ten  Plaintiff  States  have  adequately \ndemonstrated an injury in fact to their sovereign interests.11 Defendants’ guidance documents \npresently harm Plaintiff States by undermining their sovereign authority to enforce their state    \nlaws as written and imposing substantial pressure on Plaintiffs to change their state laws. And \nPlaintiffs are suffering these injuries now, making them “actual or imminent” injuries, “not \nconjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \n  Further,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs’  alleged  injuries  satisfy  the  traceability  and \nredressability requirements. The injuries to Plaintiffs’ sovereign interests stem directly from \nDefendants’  interpretations  of  Titles  VII  and  IX  as  expressed  in  the  challenged  guidance \ndocuments. That is, Plaintiffs were injured by the mere issuance of the challenged guidance. \nDefendants’ guidance, not Titles VII or IX, directly interferes with Plaintiff States’ ability to \nenforce their own laws and imposes substantial pressure on Plaintiffs to change their laws. \n \n11 Defendants urge the Court to dismiss the other ten Plaintiffs that have not specifically identified state laws that \narguably conflict with the challenged guidance documents. [Doc. 49-1 at 13, n.1]. However, “when one party has \nstanding to bring a claim, the identical claims brought by other parties to the same lawsuit are justiciable.” Phillips, \n836 F.3d at 714, n.2. Therefore, as all twenty Plaintiff States bring identical claims, this omission does not impact the \nCourt’s ability to reach the ten Plaintiff States that failed to specifically identify conflicting state laws. \n  16 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 16 of 47   PageID #: 1957\n\nRegarding redressability, the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would bar the effect of \nDefendants’ interpretations and reduce the harm alleged. True, as Defendants note, a favorable \ndecision would not prevent private litigants from suing Plaintiffs based on their understanding of \nTitles VII and IX. However, to satisfy the redressability requirement, Plaintiffs “need not show \nthat a favorable decision will relieve [their] every injury.” Parsons v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 801 F.3d \n701, 716 (6th Cir. 2015). If the Court were to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the guidance \nagainst  Plaintiffs,  and  ultimately  found  the  challenged  guidance  to  be  unlawful,  Plaintiffs’ \nsovereign interests would be protected.  \n  In  conclusion,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  Article  III’s  standing \nrequirement. Plaintiff States have demonstrated an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the \nchallenged agency action and will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.  \n2.  Ripeness \n  In  addition  to  standing,  Plaintiffs  face  another  jurisdictional  challenge—ripeness. \n“Ripeness is a justiciability doctrine designed ‘to prevent the courts, through avoidance of \npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative \npolices, and also to protect agencies from judicial interference until [an] administrative decision \nhas been formalized and its effects felt in concrete ways by challenging parties.’” Nat’l Park Hosp. \nAss’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807-08 (2003) (quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, \n387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967)). “Ripeness focuses on the timing of the action rather than on the \nparties who bring suit.” Peoples Rights Org., Inc. v. City of Columbus, 152 F.3d 522, 527 (6th Cir. \n1998).   \n  Defendants  argue  that  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  not  ripe  because  there  is  no  pending \nenforcement  action.  [Doc.  48  at  28-29].  True,  the  challenged  guidance  has  not  yet  been        \n  17 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 17 of 47   PageID #: 1958\n\nenforced against any Plaintiff State. However, this fact does not require the Court to conclude \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not ripe. Defendants’ argument ignores a long line of precedent allowing pre-\nenforcement judicial review of agency actions. See Parke, Davis & Co. v. Califano, 564 F.2d 1200, \n1204 (6th Cir. 1977) (“It cannot be argued since Abbott Laboratories that district courts are totally \nwithout jurisdiction to conduct pre-enforcement review of agency actions.”); Ohio Forestry Ass’n, \nInc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998); Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 153-54; Toilet \nGoods Ass'n v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158 (1967); Kiser, 765 F.3d at 609 (internal citations omitted) \n(“[A]dministrative action…may give rise to harm sufficient to justify pre-enforcement review.”); \nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. F.T.C., 710 F.2d 1165, 1170-71 (6th Cir. 1983) (collecting \ncases discussing pre-enforcement review of agency action); U.S. Telecom Ass’n v. F.C.C., 825 \nF.3d 674, 739 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (explaining that agency rules are “typically reviewable without \nwaiting for enforcement.”).    \n  “[A]gency action under the Administrative Procedure Act is presumptively reviewable.” \nArizona, 2022 WL 2437870, at *9 (internal citations omitted); 5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), 702. “Courts \nconfronted with close questions of ripeness are appropriately guided by the presumption of \nreviewability, especially when the affected person is confronted with the dilemma of choosing \nbetween disadvantageous compliance or risking imposition of serious penalties.” Ciba-Geigy \nCorp. v. U.S.E.P.A., 801 F.2d 430, 434 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citing Continental Air Lines, Inc. v. \nC.A.B., 522 F.3d 107, 128 (D.C. Cir. 1974)). In analyzing the ripeness of pre-enforcement      \nagency action, courts consider two factors: “(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and \n(2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.” Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n, 538 \nU.S. at 808; Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149. \n \n  18 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 18 of 47   PageID #: 1959\n\na.  Fitness for Judicial Decision \n  The first ripeness factor encompasses several considerations: (1) whether the questions \npresented are purely legal; (2) whether further factual development would significantly advance \nthe court’s ability to deal with the legal issues presented; and (3) whether the agency’s action \nconstitutes final agency action. Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 804, 812; Prod. Credit Ass’n \nof N. Ohio v. Farm Credit Admin., 846 F.3d 373, 375 (6th Cir. 1988); Ciba-Geigy Corp., 801 F.2d \nat 435 (citing Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149-52). \n  First,  the  parties  dispute  whether  this  case  involves  purely  legal  issues.  Plaintiffs      \nmaintain that the issues are purely legal, as their claims turn solely on the contents of the     \nguidance documents; thus, no further factual development is required for the Court to adjudicate \ntheir claims. [Docs. 57 at 14, 58 at 27]. Defendants disagree, arguing “the question of whether \nTitles VII or IX have been violated [] is an inherently fact-bound inquiry,” thus, “the question of \nwhether any Plaintiff State potentially has violated Title VII or Title IX would necessarily turn on \nthe facts of any given situation.” [Doc. 65 at 13-14]. \n  Defendants’ argument mischaracterizes the issues in this case. The Court is not tasked   \nwith  determining  whether  any  Plaintiff  has  violated  Titles  VII  or  IX  (which  would  likely         \nrequire further factual development). Instead, the Court is asked to decide whether Defendants’ \nguidance, on its face, violates the APA and the Constitution due to alleged procedural and \nsubstantive defects. That is, Plaintiffs raise a question as to the procedures Defendants needed to \nfollow before issuing the guidance and challenge the content of the guidance as being unlawful. \nTo resolve these issues, the Court need only consider the procedures Defendants followed in \nissuing the guidance and the substantive content of the guidance itself in light of the Bostock \ndecision. As such, the Court finds this case raises purely legal issues that “would not be clarified \n  19 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 19 of 47   PageID #: 1960\n\nby further factual development.” Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149.  \n  It is not apparent how further factual development would significantly advance the Court’s \nability to resolve these issues. Defendants only suggest that further factual development is needed \nbecause of the “fact-intensive nature of Titles VII and IX violations.” [Doc. 65 at 13-14]. But \nagain, the Court is not asked to determine whether any Plaintiff has violated Titles VII or IX. \nInstead, the Court is asked to resolve facial challenges to Defendants’ guidance, and “[f]acial \nchallenges to a regulation are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation is passed.” \nTexas v. EEOC., No. 2:21-cv-194-Z, at 27 (N.D. Tex. May 26, 2022) (citing Suitum v. Tahoe Reg’l \nPlan. Agency, 520 U.S. 725, 736 n.10 (1997)). The Court’s ability to resolve Plaintiffs’ facial \nchallenges to the guidance itself would not benefit from a concrete factual record. See Texas, No. \n2:21-cv-194-Z at 28 (finding no need to wait for further factual development where plaintiff merely \nraised a facial attack to EEOC guidance, as the issues did “not involve a particular enforcement \naction…but challenge[d] the legality of a generally applicable rule”); Texas v. United States, 201 \nF. Supp. 3d 810, 824 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 21, 2016) (finding further factual development would not \nsignificantly advance the courts ability to deal with the legal issues where “Defendants’ Guidelines \nclash with Plaintiffs’ state laws and policies in relation to public school facilities and Plaintiffs \nhave called into question the legality of those Guidelines”). \n  Finally,  as  this  Court  explains  in  detail  below,  the  challenged  guidance  documents \nconstitute  final  agency  action.  Infra  at  25.  Defendants’  guidance  documents  “mark  the \nconsummation of the [respective] agency’s decision-making process” and purport to determine the \n“rights or obligations” of those subject to Titles VII and IX, including Plaintiffs. Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal citations omitted). \n  Based on the foregoing, the issues presented are fit for judicial decision, weighing in favor \n  20 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 20 of 47   PageID #: 1961\n\nof a finding that this case is ripe for adjudication.  \nb.  Hardship \n  The second ripeness consideration is the hardship imposed on the parties in deferring \nconsideration by the Court. Defendants argue Plaintiffs face no hardship from the withholding of \njudicial review at this juncture, as Plaintiffs would have a full opportunity to present their claims \nin any future enforcement proceeding. [Doc. 49-1 at 14]. But “enforcement proceedings…are \nconcerned primarily, if not solely, with the factual issues of compliance” and this case does not \nconcern factual issues of compliance.  Romeo Comm. Sch. v. U.S. Dept. of Health, Educ., and \nWelfare, 438 F. Supp. 1021, 1028 (E.D. Mich. 1977). The Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs \nface no hardship simply because an enforcement action might provide them an opportunity to \nassert their claims. \n  Plaintiffs  contend  that  delaying  review  would  cause  them  significant  hardship,  as \nDefendants  would  be  allowed  to  use  the  “fear  of  future  sanctions”  to  “force  immediate \ncompliance” with the challenged guidance. [Doc. 58 at 27] (internal citations omitted). Absent \njudicial review, Plaintiffs claim they are put to the “choice of [] abandoning enforcement of their \nlaws or risking the loss of their federal [] funding.” [Doc. 57 at 14].  \n  In deciding whether delayed review would cause hardship, courts consider whether the \nagency’s action triggers an “immediate and significant change in the plaintiffs’ conduct of their \naffairs with serious penalties attached to noncompliance.” Sch. Dist. of Pontiac v. Sec’y of U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 263-64 (6th Cir. 2009) (quoting Suitum, 520 U.S. at 743-44); Abbott \nLaboratories, 387 U.S. at 153. Courts consistently find sufficient hardship that warrants prompt \njudicial review where plaintiffs must choose between compliance with allegedly unlawful agency \naction at considerable expense and non-compliance at the risk of enforcement that would involve \n  21 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 21 of 47   PageID #: 1962\n\na risk of substantial penalties. See Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 153-54 (finding hardship where \nplaintiffs  had  to  choose  between  compliance  with  a  possibly  unlawful  regulation  and  non-\ncompliance at the risk of future enforcement that would entail substantial fines and reputational \nlosses); S.C. Elec. & Gas Co. v. I.C.C., 734 F.3d 1541, 1545 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (collecting cases) \n(“The requisite ‘hardship’ may exist if an agency rule, although not yet enforced against the \ncomplainant, compels the complainant to choose between compliance, at some present cost, and \nfailure to comply, at the risk of legal penalty.”).12 \n  As demonstrated above, the harm alleged by Plaintiff States is already occurring—their \nsovereign power to enforce their own legal code is hampered by the issuance of Defendants’ \nguidance and they face substantial pressure to change their state laws as a result. Supra at 12-14. \nBecause Defendants’ guidance purports to define the legal obligations of those subject to Titles \nVII and IX, including Plaintiffs, and because Defendants have pledged to enforce Titles VII and \nIX consistent with the guidance, Plaintiffs are left in a quandary. Supra at 13-14. Plaintiffs must \neither forgo the enforcement of their conflicting state laws to comply with the allegedly unlawful \nguidance or violate the guidance and risk significant legal consequences—an enforcement action, \n \n12 See also Sch. Dist. of Pontiac., 584 F.3d at 263-64 (finding hardship where “school district Plaintiffs must decide \nbetween drastic budget reallocation to comply with [No Child Left Behind] and serious statutory consequences”); \nNat’l Rifle Assoc. of Am. v. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, 287 (6th Cir. 1997) (finding hardship where regulations forced the \nplaintiffs to either terminate a line of business, make substantial expenditures to comply with the new rules, or willfully \nviolate the statute and risk serious penalties); Texas, 2:21-cv-194-Z (finding hardship where guidance forced plaintiff \nto either change its employment policies to reflect the agency’s interpretation of Tile VII or risk civil liability); Neese \nv. Becerra, 2022 WL 1265925, at *10 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 26, 2022) (finding hardship to the parties where “Plaintiffs \nface[d] the fear of losing federal funds if they d[id] not act according to the interpretation of ‘sex’ described in the \n[Department of Health and Human Services] Notification” issued as a result of President’s Executive Order); West \nVirginia v. U. S. Dep’t of Treasury, 2021 WL 2952863, at *7 (N.D. Ala. July 14, 2021) (finding hardship where \nplaintiff States either had to revise their laws or budget for possible recoupment of federal funding); Franciscan All. \nv. Burwell, 227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 681 (N.D. Tex. 2016) (“Substantial hardship is typically satisfied when a party is \nforced to choose between refraining from allegedly lawful activity or engaging in the allegedly lawful activity and \nrisking significant sanctions.”); Philip Morris USA Inc. v. U. S. Food & Drug Admin., 202 F. Supp. 3d 31, 48 (D.C. \nCir. 2016) (“Plainly, in light of the Guidance, tobacco companies are given a choice: either comply with the FDA’s \ninterpretation of the TCA…or risk a possible enforcement action. But, of course, that is no real choice at all. The \nGuidance thus poses an immediate and significant practical hardship to Plaintiffs.”).  \n \n  22 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 22 of 47   PageID #: 1963\n\ncivil penalties, and the loss of federal funding. \n  This is an untenable choice. Supra at 14. There are significant stakes involved in a future \nenforcement action. Plaintiff Tennessee has submitted declarations demonstrating these stakes. \nDuring  the  2020-2021  fiscal  year,  the  Tennessee  Department  of  Education  received \n$1,544,025,800 in federal funding, and Tennessee’s public higher educational institutions received \n$88,354,400 in federal funding. [Doc. 11-1]. The loss of such critical federal funding would require \nTennessee to eliminate certain educational services or seek new funding sources to continue \noffering  the  same  programs.  [Docs.  11-2,  11-3].  Furthermore,  as  an  employer  of  42,000 \nemployees, the State of Tennessee faces considerable financial penalties for violating Title VII’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination as defined in the challenged guidance. [Doc. 11-5].  \n  Defendants contend Plaintiffs have “no idea whether or when” an enforcement action      \nwill occur, and such uncertainty undermines ripeness. [Doc. 48 at 28] (citing Warshak v. United \nStates, 532 F.3d 521, 526 (6th Cir. 2008)). The Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown a credible \nthreat of enforcement. Plaintiffs highlight that private litigants are relying on Defendants’ guidance \nto challenge Plaintiffs’ state laws. Indeed, Defendants filed a statement of interest in pending \nlitigation against the State of West Virginia, taking the position that Title IX prohibits the state \nfrom “categorically exclud[ing] transgender girls from participating in single-sex sports restricted \nto girls.” [Docs. 11 at 15, n.1, 1 at ¶ 71] (internal citations omitted). Plaintiffs also note that the \nchallenged guidance states Defendants will interpret and enforce Titles VII and IX in a manner \nthat conflicts with the laws Plaintiffs are currently enforcing, the guidance documents are aimed \nat Plaintiffs, and Defendants have not disavowed enforcement. [Doc. 57 at 13]. Based on this \nshowing, the likelihood of an enforcement action is not as speculative as Defendants urge the Court \nto believe.  \n  23 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 23 of 47   PageID #: 1964\n\n  Given the stakes of an enforcement action and the credible threat of enforcement, absent \njudicial review at this juncture, Plaintiffs are left with no real option but to comply with guidance \nthey firmly believe is unlawful. And such compliance would be disadvantageous, as Plaintiffs \nwould be forced to abandon their duly enacted state laws. The Court finds delayed review would \ncause hardship to Plaintiffs. \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe for review. The \nharm alleged by Plaintiffs is happening now, the issues presented are purely legal, and Plaintiffs \nwould suffer significant hardship should they be required to wait to adjudicate their claims.  \nB.  Reviewability  \n  Defendants  challenge  whether  the  guidance  is  reviewable  under  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act. [Doc. 49-1 at 16-22]. Specifically, Defendants contend that the Court cannot \nreview Plaintiffs’ APA claims because (1) the challenged guidance does not constitute final agency \naction; (2) Plaintiffs have an adequate alternative remedy; and (3) Plaintiffs must adhere to Title \nIX’s exclusive enforcement scheme. [Id.].   \n  The APA  limits judicial review to “final agency action for which there is no other    \nadequate remedy in a court.” Bangura v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 487, 500 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing 5 \nU.S.C. § 704). Thus, “[w]hether there has been ‘agency action’ or ‘final agency action’ within     \nthe meaning of the APA are threshold questions; if these requirements are not met, the action is \nnot reviewable.” Fund for Animals, Inc. v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 18 (D.C. Cir. \n2006).  As  explained  above,  “agency  action  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  is \npresumptively reviewable.” Supra at 18. “Agency positions are never absolutely final. There is \nalways some danger in accelerating the review process, and always some hardship in delaying \nit….Any doubts [] are resolved by the presumption of reviewability which we have previously   \n  24 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 24 of 47   PageID #: 1965\n\nsaid ‘permeates the Abbott Laboratories ruling.’” Continental Air Lines, Inc., 522 F.2d at 128 \n(collecting cases). \n1.  Final Agency Action \n  The parties dispute whether Defendants’ guidance documents constitute “final agency \naction” under the APA. Final agency action is action that (1) “mark[s] the consummation of the \nagency’s  decision-making  process”  and  (2)  “by  which  ‘rights  or  obligations  have  been \ndetermined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (internal \ncitations omitted); Franklin v Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992) (“The core question is \nwhether the agency has completed its decision-making process, and whether the result of that \nprocess is one that will directly affect the parties.”). The Court must apply the APA’s finality \nrequirement in a “flexible” and “pragmatic” way. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 136 \nS. Ct. 1807, 1815 (2016); Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149-50.  \n  The first Bennett prong is not contested. That is, Defendants do not dispute that the \nguidance documents mark the “consummation” of their decision-making processes. [Doc. 49-1 at \n19-21]. As explained below, the Court finds that the second Bennett prong is also satisfied    \nbecause the challenged guidance determines the “rights and obligations” of those subject to Titles \nVII and IX, including Plaintiffs.  \n  In Arizona v. Biden, the Sixth Circuit summarized the relevant questions for a court to \nconsider in determining whether agency action is one “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow”:  \nWill the agency’s action impose liability on a regulated party, create legal rights, \nor mandate, bind or limit other government actors in the future? And will the \nagency’s action have a sufficiently direct and immediate impact on the aggrieved \nparty and a direct effect on its day-to-day business? If an action maintains officials’ \nindependent decisionmaking and can be discretionarily relied on, it likely lacks \nlegal effect. Through it all, we will not overlook whether the agency’s action puts \n  25 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 25 of 47   PageID #: 1966\n\na party to a Catch-22, stuck between heavy compliance costs or feared liability, \nneither of which can be undone.  \n2022 WL 2437870, at *7. (internal citations omitted). The Sixth Circuit has also noted that \n“[j]udicially  reviewable  agency  actions  normally  affect  a  regulated  party’s  possible  legal     \nliability; these consequences tend to expose parties to civil or criminal liability for non-compliance \nwith the agency’s view of the law or offer a shelter from liability if the regulated parties comply.” \nParsons v. U.S. Dep’t. of Just., 878 F.3d 162, 167 (6th Cir. 2017) (quoting Louisiana v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Engr’rs, 834 F.3d 574, 583 (5th Cir. 2016) (emphasis added)).  \n  Similarly, in Ciba-Geigy Corporation, the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit, which frequently deals with challenges to agency action, explained that courts \nmust “look primarily to whether the agency’s position is ‘definitive’ and whether it has a ‘direct \nand immediate…effect on the day-to-day business of the parties challenging the action.” 801 F.2d \nat 436 (internal citations omitted). “These indicia of finality are ordinarily controlling because they \nare highly probative of whether the agency’s position is merely tentative or, on the other hand, \nwhether the agency views its deliberative process as sufficiently final to demand compliance with \nits announced position.” Id. “Once the agency publicly articulates an unequivocal position, \nhowever, and expects regulated entities to alter their primary conduct to conform to that position, \nthe agency has voluntarily relinquished the benefit of postponed judicial review.” Id.  \n  Defendants contend the challenged guidance documents are non-binding interpretations \nthat “simply inform the public of the agencies’ interpretation of Titles VII and IX, without \npurporting to alter obligations thereunder.” [Doc. 49-1 at 19-21]. Defendants highlight that the \nguidance documents expressly state they do not have the force of law. [Doc. 48 at 37-38]. The \nDepartment’s  Interpretation  provides  that  it  “does  not  itself  determine  the  outcome  in  any \nparticular case or set of facts” and the EEOC’s Technical Assistance Document clarifies the \n  26 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 26 of 47   PageID #: 1967\n\n“contents of [the] document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind        \nthe public in any way.” [Id.].  \n  However,  Defendants’  self-serving  labels  are  not  controlling.  The  Sixth  Circuit  has \nexplained that “the particular label placed upon [guidance] is not necessarily conclusive, for it is \nthe substance of what the [agency] has purported to do and has done which is decisive.” Detroit \nEdison Co. v. EPA, 496 F.2d 244, 249 (6th Cir. 1974) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis \nadded). The Court must “consider whether the practical effects of an agency’s decision make it \nfinal agency action, regardless of how it is labeled.” Columbia Riverkeeper v. U.S. Coast Guard, \n761 F.3d 1084, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 2014); Arizona, 2022 WL 2437870, at *9 (“Labels, it is true, do \nnot control the inquiry. Legal effects do.”). “[A]n agency’s interpretation of its governing statute, \nwith the expectation that regulated parties will conform to and rely on this interpretation, is final \nagency action fit for review.” Ciba-Geigy Corp., 801 F.2d at 438 (collecting cases). \n  After  considering  the  substance  and  practical  effects  of  the  challenged  guidance \ndocuments, and the criteria for finality set forth above, the Court concludes that Defendants’ \nguidance determines the “rights or obligations” of those subject to Titles VII and IX and thus \nconstitute final agency action.  \n  The text of the Department’s Interpretation indicates that the guidance is final. The \nInterpretation authoritatively purports to interpret Title IX’s “on the basis of sex” language to \n“encompass [] discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.” [Doc. 1-2 at 3-4]. \nThe  Interpretation  “will  guide  the  Department  in  processing  complaints  and  conducting \ninvestigations”  and  the  Department  vows  to  “fully  enforce  Title  IX”  consistent  with  the \nInterpretation. [Id.]. The Interpretation “supersedes and replaces any prior inconsistent statements \nmade by the Department regarding the scope of Title IX’s jurisdiction over discrimination based \n  27 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 27 of 47   PageID #: 1968\n\non sexual orientation or gender identity.” [Id.].  \n  Additionally, the text of the Dear Educator Letter and Fact Sheet indicates that the \nDepartment’s guidance is final agency action. The Dear Educator Letter alerts regulated entities \nthat the Department “will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual \norientation  and  gender  identity”  and  references  an  accompanying  Fact  Sheet  for  further \nclarification. [Doc. 1-4]. The Fact Sheet provides “[regulated entities] have a responsibility to \ninvestigate and address sex discrimination…against students because of their perceived or actual \nsexual orientation or gender identity” and notes the Department “can [] provide information to \nassist schools in meeting their legal obligations.” [Id.] (emphasis added).  \n  The Interpretation, Dear Educator Letter, and Fact Sheet bind the Department, and alter   \nthe rights and obligations of the regulated entities it oversees. The Interpretation articulates the \nDepartment’s  latest  and  final  position  regarding  the  scope  of  Title  IX’s  prohibition  of \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” and affirms that Title IX will be “fully enforce[d]” consistent \nwith that position. Because the Interpretation “supersedes and replaces any prior inconsistent \nstatement made by the Department,” the Department has spoken definitively on the issue in \ndispute. The Interpretation dictates how the Department will enforce Title IX going forward and \nrequires the Department to investigate and pursue enforcement action against regulated entities, \nincluding Plaintiffs, when discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is \nalleged.  \n  Further, by expanding the scope of Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis \nof sex,” the Interpretation broadly determines the rights and obligations of entities that receive \nfederal funding under Title IX, including Plaintiffs. The Interpretation puts limitations on regulated \nentities’ treatment of individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, and the Fact \n  28 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 28 of 47   PageID #: 1969\n\nSheet emphasizes that regulated entities have a “responsibility” and “legal obligation[]” to protect \nstudents from sex discrimination. The Department clearly expects regulated entities to conform to \nand rely on the guidance, as evidenced by its promise to “fully enforce” Title IX consistent with \nthe Interpretation, as well as the Department’s decision to directly alert regulated entities to its \nunderstanding of Title IX with the Dear Educator Letter and Fact Sheet.  \n  Similarly, the express language of the EEOC’s Technical Assistance Document indicates \nthat the guidance is final agency action. The Technical Assistance Document “provide[s] clarity \nto  the  public  regarding  existing  requirements  under  the  law”  and  describes  “the  EEOC’s \nestablished  legal  positions  on  sexual-orientation  and  gender-identity-related  workplace \ndiscrimination issues.” [Doc. 1-5 at 4] (emphasis added). The Technical Assistance Document \npurports to speak authoritatively on specific conduct that constitutes discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity. [Id. at 7-8]. The Technical Assistance Document provides \nthat regulated employers cannot “prohibit[] a transgender person from dressing or presenting  \nconsistent with that person’s gender identity,” “deny an employee equal access to a bathroom, \nlocker room, or shower that corresponds to the employee’s gender identity,” and “intentionally \nand repeatedly [use] the wrong name and pronouns to refer to a transgender employee.” [Id.].      \nThe Technical Assistance Document concludes by informing applicants and employees how to \nproceed if they believe their rights under Title VII have been violated, and promises that the   \nEEOC “will [then] conduct an investigation to determine if applicable [EEO] laws have been \nviolated.” [Id. at 8-9].  \n  Though the EEOC maintains that the Technical Assistance Document does not alter \nemployers’ obligations under Title VII, it precisely does. The Technical Assistance Document \ntakes  firm  stances  regarding  what  specific  employer  conduct  constitutes  impermissible  sex \n  29 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 29 of 47   PageID #: 1970\n\ndiscrimination under Title VII. The Technical Assistance Document uses mandatory language, \nthereby imposing obligations on covered employers to permit individuals to dress or present \nconsistent with their gender identity, and to allow individuals to use the bathrooms, locker      \nrooms, and showers consistent with their gender identity. The Technical Assistance Document \nexplains that employers’ failure to do so “would constitute sex discrimination” under Title VII. \nThus, rather than generally describing best practices for employers, the Technical Assistance \nDocument takes firm positions regarding what Title VII demands of employers. \n  Further, the Technical Assistance Document invites individuals to contact the EEOC if \nthey believe their rights under Title VII, as defined therein, have been violated; and the EEOC     \nhas pledged to “conduct an investigation” when such sex discrimination is alleged. By inviting \nindividuals to file complaints of sex discrimination consistent with the guidance and requiring the \nEEOC’s staff to investigate claims of sex discrimination related to the issues in the guidance, the \nTechnical Assistance Document “opens the field of potential plaintiffs” in a way that carries legal \nconsequences for employers. Texas, 933 F.3d at 443-44 (internal citations omitted) (finding EEOC \nguidance carried legal consequences for employers where it was “to be used by ‘individuals who \nsuspect [] they have been denied jobs or promotions, or have been discharged’” in a manner \ndeemed unlawful by the guidance, as it “open[ed] the ‘field of potential plaintiffs’”). Applicants \nand employees are instructed to rely on the Technical Assistance Document in deciding whether \nto file a sex discrimination claim, and the Technical Assistance Document requires the EEOC’s \nstaff to assess sex discrimination claims consistent with the guidance. Thus, in practical effect, the \nTechnical Assistance Document requires employers to comply with its stated positions to avoid \nliability.  \n  Lastly, an overarching issue with the guidance documents also indicates Plaintiffs are \n  30 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 30 of 47   PageID #: 1971\n\nchallenging final agency action. Both the Department and EEOC maintain that their respective \nguidance documents are required by the Bostock decision.  However, Defendants ignore the    \nlimited reach of Bostock. The Bostock decision only addressed sex discrimination under Title     \nVII; the Supreme Court expressly declined to “prejudge” how its holding would apply to “other \nfederal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination” such as Title IX. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at      \n1753.  Similarly,  the  Supreme  Court  explicitly  refused  to  decide  whether  “sex-segregated \nbathrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  dress  codes”  violate  Title  VII.  Id.  Bostock  does  not require \nDefendants’ interpretations of Title VII and IX. Instead, Defendants fail to cabin themselves to \nBostock’s holding. Defendants’ guidance documents advance new interpretations of Titles VII   \nand IX and impose new legal obligations on regulated entities.13 Thus, as further explained below, \nthe challenged guidance documents are legislative rules; and “[l]egislative or substantive rules are, \nby definition, final agency action.”  Doe v. U.S. Customs & Border Protection, 2021 WL 980888, \nat *9 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 16, 2021) (quoting Broadgate Inc. v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., \n730 F.Supp.2d 240, 243 (D.C. Cir. 2010)).  \n  Under the Supreme Court’s instruction to approach finality in a flexible and pragmatic \nway, the Court finds that Defendants’ guidance documents constitute final agency action subject \nto judicial review under the APA. As demonstrated above, both Bennett prongs for final agency \naction  are  satisfied.  First, it  is  undisputed  that Defendants’  guidance  documents  “mark  the \nconsummation of the agency’s decision-making process.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (internal \ncitations  omitted).  Second,  the  guidance  documents  purport  to  determine  the  rights  and   \n \n13 Cf. Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. EPA, 947 F.3d 1065, 1070 (7th Cir. 2020) (“Letters restating earlier \ninterpretations likewise do not carry legal consequences for purposes of the ‘final agency action’ requirement.”); \nClayton Cnty., Georgia v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 887 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th Cir. 2018) (“An agency’s restatement of \nan already-existing policy or interpretation does not, on its own, determine any rights or obligations and imposes no \nlegal consequences.”); Gen. Motors Corp. v. EPA, 363 F.3d 442, 449-51 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (holding that a letter from \nan agency that reflected “neither a new interpretation nor a new policy” did not “impose new obligations”). \n  31 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 31 of 47   PageID #: 1972\n\nobligations of those subject to Titles VII and IX, including Plaintiffs, and Defendants have left    \nno doubt that they intend to enforce their respective governing statutes consistent with the \nguidance. Id.  \n2.  Adequate Remedy \n  Defendants contend that the APA’s alternative remedy provision precludes Plaintiffs from \nbringing this standalone action. [Doc. 48 at 31]. As to the “no other adequate remedy in court” \nprerequisite, “[t]he essential inquiry is whether another statutory scheme of judicial review exists \nso as to preclude review under the more general provisions of the APA.” Bangura v. Hansen, 434 \nF.3d 487, 501 (6th Cir. 2006). This requirement “[e]nsures that the APA’s general grant of \njurisdiction to review agency decisions is not duplicative of more specific statutory procedures for \njudicial review.” Id. The “adequate remedy” limitation on APA review is interpreted narrowly, \nsuch that it should not be “construed to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad spectrum \nof judicial review of agency action.” Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 (1988). \nDefendants argue Plaintiffs have an adequate alternative remedy, as their claims can be \nasserted in defense of any future enforcement action under Titles VII or IX. [Doc. 48 at 31-32]. \nPlaintiffs disagree, claiming an ability to raise their claims as defenses in a future enforcement \naction is not the kind of adequate remedy contemplated by the APA. [Doc. 57 at 15]. Plaintiffs   \ncite Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 127 (2012), in support of their position. [Id.].  \nIn Sackett, the Supreme Court allowed a pre-enforcement challenge to an Environmental \nProtection Agency (“EPA”) compliance order even though “judicial review ordinarily comes by \nway of civil action brought by the EPA.” 566 U.S. at 127. The Court held that “APA review” was \nthe only “adequate remedy” because the plaintiffs could not “initiate [an enforcement action]” and, \ninstead, had to “wait for the Agency to drop the hammer” while they accrued potential liability \n  32 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 32 of 47   PageID #: 1973\n\npursuant to the Clean Water Act. Id. at 127, 131; see also U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs., 578 U.S. at \n600 (internal citations omitted) (“Respondents need not assume [the risk of exposure to civil \npenalties] while waiting for EPA to ‘drop the hammer’ in order to have their day in court.”).14 \n  Plaintiffs argue that the same logic applies here; the Court agrees. Defendants’ guidance \ndocuments impose legal obligations on Plaintiff States; and Plaintiffs are left in a quandary as a \nresult. True, Plaintiffs could raise their same arguments as defenses in a future enforcement \nproceeding. But also true, and undisputed, Plaintiffs cannot initiate an enforcement proceeding to \nhave their claims heard. Instead, Plaintiffs must “wait for [Defendants] to drop the hammer” by \nelecting to commence enforcement proceedings; and Plaintiffs are exposed to potential liability \nfor failing to comply with their purported  legal obligations, as explained in the challenged \nguidance, in the interim. Id. at 127, 131.    \n  Defendants  believe  Sackett  is  distinguishable,  arguing  Plaintiffs  “face  no  immediate \nconsequences that would justify raising their arguments in a pre-enforcement challenge.” [Doc.   \n65 at 15]. In Sackett, legal consequences flowed from the Government’s compliance order, as it \nexposed  the  landowners  to  increased  financial  penalties  in  a  subsequent  civil  enforcement \nproceeding. 566 U.S. at 126-27. Plaintiffs do not face consequences as concrete as those in   \nSackett, as Defendants have not determined whether any Plaintiff State has violated Titles VII       \nor IX. Nevertheless, the challenged guidance documents do impose an immediate hardship on     \nPlaintiffs. That is, Plaintiffs face obligations and consequences as a result of the challenged \nguidance. As the Court previously explained, the challenged guidance documents purport to \n \n14 Similarly, other courts have declined to find an “adequate remedy” within the meaning of the APA when a plaintiff \ncannot initiate alternative proceedings against an agency but, instead, must wait for the agency to pursue such \nproceedings. Texas, 2:21-cv-194-Z; Neese, 2022 WL 1265925, at *11; Hyatt v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, 908 F.3d \n1165, 1173 (9th Cir. 2018); Furie Operating Alaska, LLC v. U.S. Dep’t. of Homeland Sec., 2013 WL 1628639, at *6 \n(D. Alaska Apr. 15, 2013); Martinez v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 502 F. Supp. 2d 631, 635-36 (E.D. Mich. 2007). \n \n  33 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 33 of 47   PageID #: 1974\n\nestablish legal obligations that conflict with Plaintiffs’ state laws and current practices. Thus, \nPlaintiffs must choose to either: (1) alter their primary conduct and comply with the guidance—\nagainst their own interests and policies; or (2) violate the guidance at the risk of incurring \nsignificant  financial  penalties  (i.e.,  lost  federal  funding  and  civil  fines)  while  waiting  for \nDefendants to “drop the hammer.”  \n  Defendants also direct the Court to two cases from the Sixth Circuit to support their \nposition that a future enforcement action is an adequate remedy for Plaintiffs. In Quicken Loans \nInc. v. United States, the court found that an enforcement action would adequately provide an \nopportunity for the plaintiff to be heard on its claims. 152 F. Supp. 3d 938, 950 (E.D. Mich. Dec. \n31, 2015). And in Parke, Davis, & Co. v. Califano, the Sixth Circuit held the plaintiff had an \nadequate remedy because “every issue raised in [the present] case…could have been raised in \nenforcement proceedings.” 564 F.2d at 1205-06. But, in both cases, enforcement proceedings    \nwere concurrent with the litigation. 152 F. Supp. 3d at 944, 954; 564 F.3d at 1205-06. Unlike \nPlaintiffs, the injured parties in Quicken and Parke Davis had a present opportunity to challenge \nthe agency action in ongoing enforcement proceedings; they were not forced to wait for an \nenforcement proceeding to begin. \n  The Court finds that Plaintiffs do not have an adequate alternative remedy within the \nmeaning of the APA. As the Supreme Court recognized in both Sackett and U.S. Army Corps          \nof Engineers, helplessly awaiting the initiation of enforcement proceedings by Defendants and \nrisking potential liability in the interim is not an adequate remedy under the APA. 566 U.S. at   \n127; 578 U.S. at 600. \n \n  \n  34 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 34 of 47   PageID #: 1975\n\n3.  Exclusive Enforcement Scheme \nFinally, Defendants contend that this Court’s review of Plaintiffs’ Title IX claims is \nprecluded because Congress has “provided an elaborate procedural scheme for administrative \nenforcement proceedings under Title IX that culminates in the opportunity for judicial review.” \n[Doc. 49-1 at 17-18] (citing Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 207 (1994)).15 In \nsupport of their argument, Defendants rely heavily on Thunder Basin, which held that when a \nstatute provides for direct appellate review “of final agency actions, [courts] shall find that \nCongress has allocated initial review to an administrative body [when] such intent is ‘fairly \ndiscernible in the statutory scheme.’” Id. at 207 (internal citation omitted)).  \nThe right to judicial review under the APA extends to agency actions “except to the      \nextent that—(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 828 (1985) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)).    \nThe “strong presumption” favoring judicial review of agency action “fails when a statute’s \nlanguage or structure demonstrates that Congress wanted an agency to police its own conduct.” \nMach Mining, LLC, v. EEOC, 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2015). The Court must consider the “statute’s \nlanguage, structure, and purpose, its legislative history, and whether the claims can be afforded \nmeaningful review.” Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207 (internal citations omitted). Applying this \nanalysis to the relevant review scheme, the Court concludes Title IX does not preclude judicial \nreview of Plaintiffs’ pre-enforcement challenge to the Department’s guidance documents.  \n20 U.S.C. § 1682 authorizes the Department to issue “rules, regulations, or orders of \ngeneral applicability” to effectuate the purposes of Title IX. Additionally, 20 U.S.C. § 1682 \nauthorizes the Department to seek compliance with such rules, regulations, or orders by (1) \n \n15 During oral argument, Defendants acknowledged that this argument is only advanced as to Plaintiffs’ Title IX \nclaims.  \n  35 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 35 of 47   PageID #: 1976\n\nterminating or refusing to grant federal funding; or (2) any other means authorized by law.16 20 \nU.S.C. § 1683 is the only provision of Title IX that addresses judicial review, providing “[a]ny \ndepartment or agency action taken pursuant to section 1682 of this title shall be subject to such \njudicial review as may otherwise be provided by law…” and “[i]n the case of action, not otherwise \nsubject to judicial review…any person aggrieved (including any State or political subdivision \nthereof…) may obtain judicial review of such action in accordance with chapter 7 of Title 5, and \nsuch action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning \nof section 701 of that title…” \nAs evidenced above, the express language of Title IX does not foreclose all judicial   \nreview. Section 1683 only provides for judicial review of any action taken pursuant to § 1682. \nThat is, Congress only expressly provided for judicial review following an administrative decision \nto terminate or refuse funding or to seek compliance by other lawful means. Here, however, \nPlaintiffs challenge the issuance of “rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability,” and       \nthe language in § 1683 does not limit judicial review of such claims. Nothing in the language or \nstructure of Title IX indicates Congress intended to limit judicial review of the Department’s \nissuance of “rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability”, or that the Department should   \nbe allowed to police its own conduct. Therefore, pursuant to § 1683, such action is “subject to \njudicial review as…provided by law for similar action.” The APA, as the statute establishing \nprocedures and guidelines for agency rulemaking, functions as the vehicle for pre-enforcement \nchallenges to agency rules and regulations. 5 U.S.C. § 702.  \n \n16 34 C.F.R. § 100.8 provides that “other means” may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the DOJ with \na recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought; and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local \nlaw. \n  36 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 36 of 47   PageID #: 1977\n\nDefendants have failed to provide the Court with any binding authority holding that \nCongress  intended  to  preclude  pre-enforcement  judicial  review  of  the  Department’s  “rules, \nregulations, or orders of general applicability” under Title IX. And, as Plaintiffs note, several \ncourts have concluded that Title IX’s enforcement scheme does not preclude such review. See \nTexas, 2:21-cv-194-Z at 15-16; Texas, 201 F. Supp. 3d at 826-27; Romeo Cmty. Sch., 438 F.    \nSupp. at 1029 (allowing pre-enforcement challenge to regulations because Title IX’s “legislative \nscheme explicitly contemplates a cause of action under the [APA] for redress of unlawful agency \naction ‘not otherwise subject to judicial review’”)  \n“[W]here substantial doubt about [] congressional intent exists, the general presumption \nfavoring judicial review of administrative action is controlling.” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d \n134, 164 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 351 (1984)). Given \nthe applicable presumption of reviewability and the fact that Title IX contains no explicit or \nimplicit bar to judicial review of the Department’s rules, regulations, and orders of general \napplicability, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ pre-enforcement challenges to the Department’s \nguidance documents are subject to judicial review. \nC.   Preliminary Injunction Factors \n  The Court next evaluates whether a preliminary injunction is appropriate in this case. To \ndo so, the Court must consider: (1) whether Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) whether Plaintiffs will be irreparably injured absent an injunction; (3) whether issuing \nan injunction will harm Defendants; and (4) whether an injunction is in the public interest. Vitolo, \n999 F.3d at 360. For the reasons below, the Court finds that a balance of these factors weighs in \nfavor  of  a  preliminary  injunction.  The  Court  understands  a  “preliminary  injunction  is  an \nextraordinary remedy.” Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). \n  37 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 37 of 47   PageID #: 1978\n\nHowever, this case presents extraordinary circumstances.  \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nIn maintaining that the challenged guidance documents are unlawful, Plaintiffs advance \nseveral theories. However, to obtain injunctive relief, Plaintiffs need only demonstrate a likelihood \nof success on the merits of one of their claims. Hoover Transp. Servs., Inc. v. Frye, 77 F. App’x \n776, 781 (6th Cir. 2003) (“If [the moving party] can show a likelihood of success on the merits of \nany of the claims, an injunction may issue, subject to consideration of the other factors.”); Planned \nParenthood of Great Nw., Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, & Kentucky, Inc. v.  Cameron, 2022 WL \n1597163, at *4 (W.D. Ky. May 19, 2022) (collecting cases) (“The moving party need only show a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of one claim where there are multiple claims at issue in a \ncomplaint.”); Woods v. Lynch, 2016 WL 7192151, at *3 (W.D. Tenn. Dec. 12, 2016) (finding a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of at least one of the moving party’s claims was sufficient).  \n  Plaintiffs  contend  Defendants’  guidance  documents  violate  the  APA,  as  they  are \nprocedurally and substantively deficient. [Doc. 11]. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ guidance \ndocuments are procedurally invalid because (1) they were adopted without adhering to the required \nnotice and comment procedures and (2) they are arbitrary and capricious. [Id.]. Plaintiffs argue \nDefendants’ guidance documents are substantively unlawful, as they are contrary to law. [Id.]. \nDefendants contest each of these claims. [Doc. 48]. \n  The Court begins, and ends, with assessing Plaintiffs’ notice and comment claim. “The \nAPA sets different procedural requirements for ‘legislative rules’ and ‘interpretive rules’: the \nformer must be promulgated pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking; the latter need not.” \nTenn. Hosp. Ass’n v. Azar, 908 F.3d 1029, 1042 (6th Cir. 2018) (citing Perez v. Mortg. Bankers \nAss’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1203-04 (2015); 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A)). “If an agency attempts to issue a \n  38 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 38 of 47   PageID #: 1979\n\nlegislative rule without abiding by the APA’s procedural requirements, the rule is invalid.” Id. \n(citing S. Forest Watch, Inc. v. Jewell, 817 F.3d 965, 972 (6th Cir. 2016)).   \n  When issuing a legislative rule, “[an] agency must publish a notice about the proposed     \nrule, allow the public to comment on the rule, and, after considering the comments, make \nappropriate changes and include in the final rule a ‘concise general statement’ of its contents.” \nMann Constr., Inc. v. United States, 27 F.4th 1138, 1142-43 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § \n553). “Notice and comment gives affected parties fair warning of potential changes in the law    \nand an opportunity to be heard on those changes—and it affords the agency a chance to avoid \nerrors and make a more informed decision.” Id. (quoting Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. \n1804, 1816 (2019)). \n  Unsurprisingly,  Defendants  argue  that  the  challenged  guidance  documents  are  valid \ninterpretative rules exempt from notice and comment procedures, and Plaintiffs argue that the \nchallenged  guidance  documents  are  legislative  rules  subject  to  the  notice  and  comment \nrequirements. As the Sixth Circuit recently highlighted, “[t]he distinction between a legislative \nrule and an interpretive rule can be difficult to discern.” Id. Nevertheless, relying on binding \nprecedent, the Sixth Circuit explained: \n“[L]egislative rules have the force and effect of law and interpretive rules do not. \nThus, a rule that intends to create new law, rights, or duties, is legislative, while a \nrule that simply states what the administrative agency thinks the statute means, and \nonly reminds affected parties of existing duties is interpretive. Because interpretive \nrules cannot effect a substantive change in the regulations, a rule that adopts a new \nposition inconsistent with any of the [agency’s] existing regulations is necessarily \nlegislative.”  \n \nId. (internal citations omitted); see also Gen. Motors Corp v. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.2d 1561, 1565 \n(D.C. Cir. 1984) (“An interpretative rule simply states what the administrative agency thinks the \nstatute means” in a way that  “only reminds affected parties of  existing duties.”) (emphasis     \n  39 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 39 of 47   PageID #: 1980\n\nadded); NRDC v. Wheeler, 955 F.3d 68, 83 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (“A legislative rule is one that has \nlegal  effect  or,  alternately,  one  that  an  agency  promulgates  with  the  intent  to  exercise  its     \ndelegated legislative power by speaking with the force of law.”). The key question for the Court \nto consider is whether the action in question simply interprets existing law or results in a \nsubstantive change to existing law.  \n   In light of these general principles, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their notice and comment claim. Plaintiffs can establish      \nthat Defendants’ challenged guidance documents are legislative rules that create new rights          \nand obligations, and Defendants do not contend that they complied with the APA’s notice and \ncomment requirements. \n  In arguing that the challenged guidance documents are not legislative rules, Defendants \nclaim that the guidance documents merely interpret Titles VII and IX consistent with Bostock. \n[Doc. 48 at 37-38]. However, Defendants’ guidance documents are not confined to the Bostock \ndecision.  \n  Plaintiffs contend that the Department of Education’s guidance documents improperly \nexpand the reach of Bostock. As the Sixth Circuit recently explained, “the Court in Bostock was \nclear on the narrow reach of its decision and how it was limited only to Title VII itself. The \n[Bostock] Court noted that ‘none of’ the many laws that might be touched by their decision were \nbefore them and that they ‘do not prejudge any such question today.’” Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, \nInc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753). Thus, the Sixth \nCircuit concluded “Bostock extends no further than Title VII.” Id. The Sixth Circuit has also \nrecognized, “it does not follow that principles announced in the Title VII context automatically \napply in the Title IX context.” Meriwether v. Hartop, 922 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021). \n  40 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 40 of 47   PageID #: 1981\n\nTherefore, in applying Bostock to Title IX, the Department overlooked the caveats expressly \nrecognized by the Supreme Court and created new law. The Department’s guidance purports to \nexpand the footprint of Title IX’s “on the basis of sex” language, takes definitive positions as         \nto “legal obligations” under Title IX, and explains that Title IX will be “fully enforce[d]” \naccordingly. [Docs. 1-2, 1-4]. Indeed, the Department’s challenged guidance documents go \nbeyond putting the public on notice of pre-existing legal obligations and reminding affected parties \nof their existing duties. \n  Plaintiffs further contend that the Department’s guidance “squarely conflicts with both \nTitle IX itself and its implementing regulations, which expressly permit sex-separated living \nfacilities and athletic teams.” [Doc. 57 at 22] (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1686, 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.33, \n106.37(c), 106.41(b)). True, Title IX does allow for sex-separation in certain circumstances; and \nthe Department’s guidance, specifically the Fact Sheet, appears to suggest such conduct will be \ninvestigated as unlawful discrimination. [Doc. 1-4] (explaining Defendants can investigate a \nprincipal barring a high school transgender girl (i.e., a biological male) from entering the girls’ \nrestroom  and  a  coach  turning  her  away  from  an  all-girls  sports  tryout  as  unlawful  sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX). Thus, Defendants’ guidance plausibly “adopt[s] a new position \ninconsistent with…[the Department’s] existing regulations,” supporting the conclusion that the \nDepartment’s guidance is legislative. Tenn. Hosp. Ass’n., 908 F.3d at 1042 (quoting Shalala v. \nGuernsey Mem’l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 100 (1995)).   \n  Therefore, as explained above, Plaintiffs can show that the Department of Education’s \nguidance creates rights for students and obligations for regulated entities not to discriminate     \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity that appear nowhere in Bostock, Title IX, or its \nimplementing  regulations.  Accordingly,  it  follows  that  Plaintiff  States  can  demonstrate  the \n  41 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 41 of 47   PageID #: 1982\n\nDepartment’s guidance documents are legislative rules. See Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232 \n(1974) (holding that a substantive rule or “a legislative-type rule,” is one that “affect[s] individual \nrights and obligations.”); see also Texas, 201 F. Supp. 3d at 829-30 (concluding that similar \nguidance issued by the Department of Education was legislative). \n  Likewise,  the  EEOC’s  Technical  Assistance  Document  goes  beyond  the  holding  of     \nBostock. The Supreme Court only held that Title VII prohibits an employer from “fir[ing]   \nsomeone simply for being homosexual or transgender.” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753. The Court \nexpressly declined to “prejudge” other issues that might be implicated by Title VII, such as “sex-\nsegregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes.” Id. Interestingly, the Technical Assistance \nDocument recognizes that “[Bostock] explicitly reserved some issues for future cases.” [Doc. 1-5 \nat 5]. Yet, the Technical Assistance Document then purports to explain what Title VII requires of \ncovered employers with regard to the exact conduct Bostock declined to address (i.e., bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, dress codes). [Id. at 7-8]. The EEOC’s guidance identifies and creates rights for \napplicants and employees that have not been established by federal law, and it directs employers \nto comply with those obligations to avoid liability.17 See Bear Creek Bible Church v. Equal Emp. \nOpportunity Comm’n, 2021 WL 5449038, at *13 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 22, 2021) (reaching the same \nconclusion about the EEOC guidance at issue).  As such, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs can \n \n17 Defendant EEOC contends the Technical Assistance Document is not legislative, as it is based, in part, on “its \nprevious administrative decisions.” [Doc. 65 at 23]. However, the EEOC’s prior decisions concerning sexual \norientation and gender identity are not binding authority and cannot be considered definitive interpretations of Title \nVII. Lee v. City of Columbus, Ohio, 636 F.3d 245, 256 (6th Cir. 2011); White v. Burlington Northern & Santa Fe R. \nCo., 364 F.3d 789, 812 (6th Cir. 2004) (Clay, E. concurring); Young v. Dep’t of the Treasury, 2020 WL 3980796, at \n*9 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 9, 2020) (collecting cases) (“Although not binding authority, the EEOC’s decisions and \nregulations are persuasive.”); Brown v. Subway Sandwich Shop of Laurel, Inc., 2016 WL 3248457 (S.D. Miss. June \n13, 2016) (collecting cases) (explaining that EEOC’s prior decisions did not require the court to conclude that \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited by Title VII). Therefore, until the Sixth Circuit or the Supreme \nCourt recognizes the opinions expressed in the EEOC’s prior decisions (i.e., that Title VII prohibits discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity with respect to bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes) such rights \nand obligations have not been established under federal law.  \n  42 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 42 of 47   PageID #: 1983\n\ndemonstrate the EEOC’s Technical Assistance Document is a legislative rule. Morton, 415 U.S. \nat 232. \n  Thus, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on their claim that \nDefendants’ guidance documents are legislative rules and that the guidance is invalid because \nDefendants failed to comply with the required notice and comment procedures under the APA. \nAccordingly, this first preliminary injunction factor weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor. \n2.  Irreparable Harm \n  The second preliminary injunction factor asks whether the movant “is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.” Platt v. Bd. of Comm’rs on Grievances & \nDiscipline of the Ohio Sup. Ct., 769 F.3d 447, 453 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. \nDefense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008)). “A plaintiff’s harm from the denial of a preliminary \ninjunction is irreparable if it is not fully compensable by monetary damages.” Overstreet v. \nLexington-Fayette Urban Cty. Gov’t, 305 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Basicomputer \nCorp. v. Scott, 973 F.2d 507, 511 (6th Cir. 1992)).  \n  Plaintiffs claim “a State ‘suffers a form of irreparable injury’ any time it is prevented      \nfrom ‘effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people.’” [Doc. 11 at 33] (quoting \nThompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 619 (6th Cir. 2020)). However, the Sixth Circuit held that \nStates suffer irreparable harm when enjoined from enforcing their laws. Thompson, 976 F.3d at \n619 (quoting Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301 (2012)). Here, no party seeks to enjoin Plaintiff \nStates from enforcing their laws; rather, the States themselves are pursuing injunctive relief against \nDefendants.  \n  Nevertheless, as a practical matter, the interest in this case is the same. Plaintiffs have \nsovereign interests in enforcing their duly enacted state laws. Supra at 11. Plaintiffs suffered an \n  43 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 43 of 47   PageID #: 1984\n\nimmediate injury to their sovereign interests when Defendants issued the challenged guidance, as \nDefendants’ guidance and several of Plaintiffs’ statutes conflict. Absent an injunction, Plaintiff \nStates’ ability to enforce their conflicting state laws will remain hampered, and Plaintiffs will \ncontinue to face substantial pressure to change their state laws in order to avoid material legal \nconsequences. \n  Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have carried their burden to show irreparable \nharm. See Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2324 n.17 (2018) (noting that a state’s “inability to \nenforce its duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the State”); Kentucky v. Biden, \n23 F.4th 585, 611 n. 19 (6th Cir. 2022) (explaining that “invasions of state sovereignty…likely \ncannot be economically qualified, and thus cannot be monetarily redressed”); Kansas v. United \nStates, 249 F.3d 1213, 1227-28 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding irreparable harm to the State where \nfederal agency’s action “places its sovereign interests and public policies at stake”); Texas, 201    \nF.  Supp.  at  834-35  (finding  irreparable  harm  under  similar  circumstances).  This  second \npreliminary injunction factor weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor. \n3.  Harm to Others  \n  Defendants  argue  that  granting  an  injunction  will  impede  their  ability  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination in the educational and workplace settings, prevent them from explaining their \nunderstanding of the requirements imposed by Titles VII and IX, and leave confusion about \nregulated entities’ legal obligations. [Doc. 48 at 50].  \n  There is no question that an injunction will harm Defendants, as they will be prevented \nfrom “fully enforc[ing]” the challenged guidance like they vowed to do. However, because \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of at least one of \ntheir  claims,  it  is  doubtful  that  Defendants  should  be  allowed  to  enforce  the  challenged        \n  44 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 44 of 47   PageID #: 1985\n\nguidance  against  Plaintiffs  in  the  interim.  Defendants  do  not  have  a  legitimate  interest  in    \nenforcing  the  guidance  documents  that  Plaintiffs  have  shown  are  likely  to  be  procedurally     \ninvalid.  \n  Because  the  challenged  guidance  documents  affect  the  sovereign  rights  of  Plaintiff     \nStates, and because this case raises substantial questions regarding the validity of that guidance, \nthe Court finds the harm to Plaintiffs outweighs any harm the preliminary injunction might cause \nDefendants. Therefore, this third factor weighs in favor of a preliminary injunction.  \n4.  Public Interest  \n  The  Sixth  Circuit  has  made  clear  that  the  “public’s  true  interest  lies  in  the  correct \napplication of the law.” Kentucky, 23 F.4th at 612; Priorities USA v. Nessel, 860 F. App’x. 419, \n422-23 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Coal. to Def. Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237, 252 \n(6th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he public interest lies in correct application of the federal constitutional and \nstatutory provisions upon which the claimants have brought this claim.”)). Defendants certainly \nhave a public interest in enforcing Titles VII and IX to the fullest extent permissible. Likewise, \nPlaintiffs undoubtedly have a strong public interest in enforcing their duly enacted state laws and \nprotecting the underlying policies. It is clear these interests conflict. The Court understands that \nboth sides feel strongly about their positions on the relevant legal and social policy questions, and \nthe public’s interest in the correct application of the law will be served by maintaining the status \nquo while the Court resolves these issues. \n  Furthermore,  as  this  Court  has  explained,  the  public  has  an  interest  in  “agencies \npromulgating  rules  that  have  the  effect  of  law  through  procedures  mandated  by  Congress       \nthrough the APA.” CIC Servs., LLC v. Internal Revenue Serv., 2021 WL 4481008, at *6 (E.D. \nTenn. Sept. 21, 2021); see also N. Marina Islands v. United States, 686 F. Supp.2d 7, 21 (D.C. Cir. \n  45 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 45 of 47   PageID #: 1986\n\n2009) (“The public interest is served when administrative agencies comply with their obligations \nunder the APA.”). Because there are questions as to Defendants’ compliance with the APA, the \npublic would benefit from a preliminary injunction. An injunction will ensure that the agencies are \nnot exceeding their express authority delegated by Congress.  \n  Accordingly, the Court finds that the fourth factor weighs in favor of a preliminary \ninjunction.  \nIV.  CONCLUSON \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. 10] is \nGRANTED and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 49] is DENIED. Accordingly, it is     \nhereby ordered that Federal Defendants and all their respective officers, agents, employees, \nattorneys,  and  persons  acting  in  concert  or  participation  with  them  are  ENJOINED  and \nRESTRAINED from implementing the Interpretation, Dear Educator Letter, Fact Sheet, and      \nthe Technical Assistance Document against Plaintiffs.18   \n  This preliminary injunction shall remain in effect pending the final resolution of this \nmatter, or until further orders from this Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, or the Supreme Court of the United States.   \n  It is further ORDERED that no security bond shall be required under Federal Rule of   \nCivil Procedure 65(c).  \n \n \n18 Plaintiffs fail to explicitly address the proper scope of the requested preliminary injunction in their briefing. \nHowever, Plaintiffs appear to believe this injunction should apply nationwide. In his recent concurrence, the Chief \nJudge of the Sixth Circuit cautioned against nationwide injunctions. See Arizona, 2022 WL 2437870, at *14 (“At a \nminimum, a district court should think twice—and perhaps twice again—before granting universal anti-enforcement \ninjunctions against the federal government.”) The Court is heavily persuaded by this concurrence and concludes that \nthis preliminary injunction should only apply to Plaintiffs. The Court has no way of determining whether the States \nnot before it wish for the challenged guidance documents to be enforced, and a nationwide injunction might “give \n[those] States victories they did not earn and…they do not want.” Id. The Court will not burden the States that did not \njoin this litigation. \n  46 \nCase 3:21-cv-00308-CEA-DCP   Document 86   Filed 07/15/22   Page 46 of 47   PageID #: 1987\n\n  SO ORDERED. \n            /s/  Charles E.
