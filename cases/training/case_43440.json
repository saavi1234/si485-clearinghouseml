Defendant sent a response, dated December 15, 2021. (Doc. No. 774.) There is no dispute that the parties have a dispute. Given the history of discovery disputes between the parties, the Court removed the IDR option during the supplemental discovery period. Moreover, Defendant does not agree to resolve the present dispute informally, even if that option were offered. Accordingly, unless the parties' resolve their dispute, formal motion practice is necessary consistent with Local Rule 7.1 and any applicable provisions of the current scheduling order.

    "summary": "<p>This case alleging that the Minnesota Department of Human Services' (DHS) reliance on group homes for individuals with disabilities made it difficult for individuals who wanted to live on their own to find housing.</p>\r\n<p>On August 3, 2016, individuals with disabilities who lived in group housing in Minnesota&mdash;including some who had tried to secure individual housing&mdash;as well as their guardians filed suit against the DHS and its commissioner.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The plaintiffs alleged a violation of the Medicaid Act's fair hearing requirements 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396a(a)(8) because their attempts to secure individualized housing services were unsuccessful, and they were unable to use disability waivers to access services that would allow them to be integrated in their community despite belonging to a class of persons who would qualify for such services. As of March 16, 2016, the DHS plans which outlined how housing would be provided ceased to mention individualized housing, or how to secure it. Plaintiffs further alleged a violation of their Due Process, Advance Notice and Fair Hearing rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, alleging they did not receive adequate information about hearings or have the ability to respond to or contest agency decisions about accessing integrated services. Plaintiffs also alleged that DHS violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing to offer and provide services to the plaintiffs in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and by unnecessarily segregating them in Community Residential Setting (CRS) facilities, instead of reasonably accommodating their requests to be integrated into the community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was initially assigned to Judge Ann D. Montgomery and referred to Magistrate Judge Steven E. Rau, but was reassigned after only one week to Judge Donovan W. Frank and Magistrate Judge Becky R. Thorson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 2016, DHS and its commissioner moved to dismiss the case. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring claims due to a lack of provable injury, and that the case was not ripe under the Medicaid Act's reasonable promptness requirement because the definitions of home and community-based settings had not yet been established under federal regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 23, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to add another named plaintiff with a disability and two legal guardians who would be capable of representing a class. The plaintiffs also added specific requests for the court to mandate DHS changes that would improve timely access to individualized housing services. In particular, the amended complaint includes a request for education efforts and service deadlines, and a periodic auditing process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 27, 2017, the plaintiffs moved to certify a class of persons aged 18 and older who were eligible for and had received a disability waiver and who lived in a licensed CRS facility and had not been given the choice or opportunity to reside in the most integrated residential setting appropriate to their needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties held a settlement conference on April 25, 2017 but were unable to reach an agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 18, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court dismissed all claims against DHS, but allowed all claims against the commissioner to proceed, explaining that claims against DHS were redundant where the commissioner was a party in her official capacity. In allowing the claims against the commissioner, the court reasoned that the plaintiffs were already experiencing segregation, and therefore had suffered an injury in fact and had standing. The court further concluded that because the plaintiffs had not been able to receive redress or due process in seeking changes to their living environments, regardless of DHS's definitional procedures, the claims were ripe for review. 260 F.Supp.3d 1084.</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2017, Judge Donovan W. Frank certified a class of all adults that were eligible for and had received a disability waiver who lived in a licensed CRS and had not been given the choice to reside in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. 2017 WL 4355970.</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2017, the defendants petitioned for permission to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which allows either party fourteen days to file a petition after an adverse class certification ruling by a District Court. The petition was denied on October 13, 2017 without explanation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 2017, the plaintiffs sought, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied, permission to appeal, without a reason given. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2018 plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions, motion for attorney fees, motion for discovery and motion for contempt, alleging the defendants had not complied with court orders regarding discovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 21, 2018 Magistrate Judge Becky R. Thorson granted in part and denied in part the motions for sanctions, attorney fees, discovery and contempt. The motions for discovery were granted, requiring defendants to provide all of the documents that the plaintiffs were seeking, because the requests were not unduly burdensome. The others were dropped without prejudice, with the assurances that defendants would now comply with discovery requests on the reasoning that sanctions could later be implemented if discovery did not occur.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Discovery disputes occurred repeatedly throughout the proceedings from 2018-2022, with several motions from both parties. The plaintiffs repeatedly raised issues regarding insufficient documentation provided by the defendants. Defendants repeatedly argued that supplying documentation regarding persons with disabilities would violate HIPPA confidentiality, and that plaintiffs' requests were too expansive and burdensome. The court compelled discovery under a series of protective orders to protect confidentiality, noting that defendants had not been in fully compliance. Defendants produced all discovery requested. Plaintiffs later approached the court requesting sanctions because too much discovery was produced, too last-minute for them to effectively prepare, but the court denied any motions for sanctions against defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 8, 2018, plaintiffs submitted a letter withdrawing their demand for a jury trial. On November 9, 2018, defendants submitted a letter stating they did not object.&nbsp;On November 15, 2018, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a judgement in her favor on all claims before the court. The defendant also moved to decertify the class. The same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgement, seeking a declaratory judgment that the defendant was violating the Medicaid Act by not providing services with reasonable promptness and violating Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment and Medicaid due process rights, because class members could go months or years without hearing the status of their requests for individualized housing. They also sought declaratory judgment holding that the defendant was violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act, and they sought injunctive relief requiring the defendant to implement policies that would ensure every Disability Waiver recipient in a state facility receive information about and access to individualized housing services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 31, 2019, Magistrate Judge Becky R. Thorson ordered a settlement conference for the parties. Settlement talks continued through March 15, 2019, leading Judge Donovan W. Frank to vacate the trial-ready date of April 15, 2019. The settlement talks ultimately proved unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 26, 2019, Judge Donovan W. Frank denied defendant's November 15, 2018, motion to decertify the class, holding that a proposed injunction or other remedy would give every class member an increased opportunity to live in the most integrated setting possible, regardless of whether or not they had been denied in the past.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court denied defendants motion for summary judgement on September 27, 2019, on the grounds that at least 192 vulnerable people in Minnesota had been harmed by defendant's policies and practices, so a system-wide remedy was needed. He partially granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgement, holding that defendant's policy violated Due Process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act's advance notice and fair hearing requirements under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983, because plaintiffs were not heard at a meaningful time in a meaningful manner. He denied granting an injunction regarding the state Medicaid policies, instead directing the parties to jointly revise the policies to be sufficiently clear and mutually agreeable. 421 F.Supp.3d 695.</p>\r\n<p>On April 5, 2022, the case was scheduled for a July 11, 2022, bench trial. On April 22, 2022, Magistrate Judge Becky R. Thorson ordered a final settlement conference be held by the parties before June 17, 2022.&nbsp;On June 2-3, 2022, the parties participated in a two-day mediation with the Honorable James M. Rosenbaum and reached a consensus on settlement agreement terms.&nbsp;On June 10, 2022, the parties emailed the court indicating they had reached a settlement and on June 13, 2022, Judge Donovan W. Frank cancelled the document deadlines and hearing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2022, plaintiffs moved for approval of a class action settlement. And, on July 27, 2022, plaintiffs submitted an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of a class action settlement agreement which the court granted the same day. The settlement required defendants to change the administration of the Disability Waiver system and provide class members who wanted to move to individualized homes with the information and access to services that would allow them to do so. The Minnesota Department of Human Services was also required to provide new training to assessors and case managers, including instructing assessors to inquire of residents in congregate settings if they are interested in moving, and provide services if appropriate. The settlement also provided for additional assistance for one of the individual plaintiffs, as well as recovery of plaintiffs' costs and attorneys' fees, and will remain in effect for 36 months from the court's final approval of the settlement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of November 22, 2022, the case is ongoing pending a Fairness Hearing on January 4, 2023.&nbsp;</p>",

Anthony, Esq., Peter McElligott, Esq., and Steven M. Pincus, Esq., Anthony \nOstlund Baer & Louwagie PA; Justin H. Perl, Esq., Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid; and \nSean B. Burke, Esq., Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, Minnesota Disability Law Center, \ncounsel for Plaintiffs. \n \nJanine Wetzel Kimble, Scott H. Ikeda, Assistant Attorneys General, Minnesota Attorney \nGeneral’s Office, counsel for Defendant. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis matter is before the Court upon Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  (Doc. No. 35.)  Defendant opposes \nthe motion.  (Doc. No. 45.)  After considering the submissions of the parties, and for the \nreasons stated, the Court finds that certification of the proposed class is appropriate.  \nThus, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is granted.  \n\nBACKGROUND \nThe Court previously detailed the background facts of this case in its May 18, \n2017 Memorandum Opinion and Order, (Doc. No. 54), and the Court only briefly \nsummarizes the facts here.1  In short, Plaintiffs are individuals with disabilities and \nMedicaid recipients who receive Home and Community Based Disability Waivers \n(“Disability Waivers”) from the State of Minnesota under the direction of Defendant \nEmily Johnson Piper (“Defendant”), Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of \nHuman Services (“DHS”).  Plaintiffs reside in Community Residential Setting (“CRS”) \nfacilities—otherwise known as corporate adult foster care—and wish to access various \nindividualized housing services available under the Disability Waivers to pursue more \nintegrated housing options.  Plaintiffs assert that their current living situations isolate and \nsegregate them from their communities in violation of federal law.  To access the services \nthey seek in a timely manner and with proper due process, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to reform Defendant’s administration of the Disability Waiver programs.  \nThe Court supplements the relevant facts as needed, below.   \nCurrently before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class of:  “[I]ndividuals \nage 18 and older who are eligible for and have received a Disability Waiver, live in a \nlicensed Community Residential Setting, and have not been given the choice and \nopportunity to reside in the most integrated residential setting appropriate to their needs.”  \n                                                           \n1   The Court directs readers to its May 18, 2017 Memorandum Opinion and Order \nand otherwise assumes familiarity with the facts and law elaborated therein.  See Murphy \nex rel. Murphy v. Minn. Dep’t of Human Servs., Civ. No. 16-2623, 2017 WL 2198133 \n(D. Minn. May 18, 2017).   \n2 \n \n\n(Doc. No. 37 at 2.)  Tenner Murphy (“Murphy”), Marrie Bottelson (“Bottelson”), and \nDionne Swanson (“Swanson”) (collectively, the “Named Plaintiffs”) assert their claims \non behalf of themselves and other similarly situated individuals (collectively, the \n“Plaintiffs”) and seek to represent the proposed class. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Standard for Class Certification Under Rule 23 \n“A class action serves to conserve the resources of the court and the parties by \npermitting an issue that may affect every class member to be litigated in an economical \nfashion.”  Ebert v. Gen. Mills, Inc., 823 F.3d 472, 477 (8th Cir. 2016).  To obtain class \ncertification, a party must first meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) by establishing that: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition, plaintiffs seeking certification “must satisfy one of the \nthree subsections of Rule 23(b).”  Ebert, 823 F.3d at 477 (quoting In re St. Jude Med., \nInc., 425 F.3d 1116, 1119 (8th Cir. 2005)).  The burden is on the plaintiffs to “show[] that \nthe class should be certified and that the requirements of Rule 23 are met.”  Id. (quoting \nLuiken v. Domino’s Pizza, LLC, 705 F.3d 370, 372 (8th Cir. 2013)).   \nDistrict courts retain “broad discretion” in determining whether to certify a class.  \nId. (citation omitted).  However, the court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” to ensure \n“that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.”  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, \n3 \n \n\n569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013) (citation omitted); see also In re Target Corp. Customer Data \nSec. Breach Litig., 847 F.3d 608, 612 (8th Cir. 2017), amended, 855 F.3d 913 (8th Cir. \n2017).  “The class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in \nthe factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff’s cause of action.”  IBEW Local 98 \nPension Fund v. Best Buy Co., 818 F.3d 775, 783 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011)).  The Eighth Circuit has noted that “class \ncertification is not the time to address the merits of the parties’ claims and defenses.”  \nElizabeth M. v. Montenez, 458 F.3d 779, 786 (8th Cir. 2006).  However, “the ‘rigorous \nanalysis’ under Rule 23 must involve consideration of what the parties must prove.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs argue that this case is particularly suited to Classwide resolution because \nit asserts an integration mandate claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”) and the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. \nZimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  Plaintiffs explain that “Olmstead claims are well suited \nfor class treatment because, among other issues, a state’s fundamental alteration defense \nnecessarily involves inquiries into the needs of all persons served by the state’s \nsupportive services system.”  (Doc. No. 37 at 12-13.)  Emphasizing the systemic nature \nof their claims, Plaintiffs assert that “[t]his case . . . attacks the Defendants’2 lack of \n                                                           \n2   When this motion was briefed by the parties, this case included multiple \nDefendants.  Although the case has now been limited to a single Defendant, occasional \nreferences to “Defendants” remain in quoted material within this Order.  The Court \nacknowledges that the only Defendant present in the case is Commissioner \nEmily Johnson Piper, Commissioner of The Minnesota Department of Human Services. \n4 \n \n\nstandardized conduct in planning, administering, and operating their Waiver service \nsystem.”  (Doc. No. 51 at 2.)  \n Defendant identifies four key issues with Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification:  \n(1) the Court cannot evaluate numerosity based on Plaintiffs’ vague proposed class; \n(2) individual determinations prevent commonality among the proposed class; (3) the \nNamed Plaintiffs do not have injuries typical of the class; and (4) Plaintiffs seek remedies \nthat would be improper under Rule 23(b).   \nThe Court considers each of the requirements for class certification in light of the \nparties’ arguments, below.  \nII.  Rule 23(a) \nA.  Numerosity \nFirst, the proponent of class certification must prove that “the class is so numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Regarding \nnumerosity, “[n]o arbitrary rules regarding the necessary size of classes have been \nestablished.”  Paxton v. Union Nat’l Bank of Little Rock, 688 F.2d 552, 559 (8th Cir. \n1982).  In general, however, “a class of 40 or more members raises a presumption of \nimpracticability of joinder based on numbers alone.”  William B. Rubenstein, Newberg \non Class Actions § 3:12 (5th ed. 2017 Update).  With respect to the practicability of \njoinder, relevant factors include not only “the size of the class,” but “also . . . the nature \nof the action, the size of the individual claims, the inconvenience of trying individual \nsuits, and any other factor relevant to the practicability of joining all the putative class \nmembers.”  Paxton, 688 F.2d at 559-60.  A court may also take into account factors such \n5 \n \n\nas “the asserted disabilities of proposed class members, and geographic diversity.”  See \nKenneth R. ex rel. Tri-Cty. CAP, Inc./GS v. Hassan, 293 F.R.D. 254, 265 (D.N.H. 2013). \n  The Eighth Circuit does not impose a separate ascertainability requirement for \nclass certification but “adheres to a rigorous analysis of the Rule 23 requirements, which \nincludes that a class must be adequately defined and clearly ascertainable.”  Sandusky \nWellness Ctr., LLC v. Medtox Sci., Inc., 821 F.3d 992, 996 (8th Cir. 2016) (quotation \nmarks omitted).  “A class may be ascertainable when its members may be identified by \nreference to objective criteria.”  McKeage v. TMBC, LLC, 847 F.3d 992, 998 (8th Cir. \n2017).  Other Courts of Appeal have determined that ascertainability is not required in \nthe context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  See, e.g., \nShelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 562-63 (3d Cir. 2015).  Even in this Circuit, one court \nrecently noted in evaluating a Rule 23(b)(2) class that “Plaintiffs are not required to \nspecify an exact number or to prove the identity of each class member, rather, the \nplaintiffs must only show a reasonable estimate of the number of class members.”  \nPostawko v. Mo. Dep’t of Corr., Civ. No. 2:16-cv-04219-NKL, 2017 WL 3185155, at *6, \n12 (W.D. Mo. July 26, 2017), appeal filed, No. 17-3029 (8th Cir. Sept. 19, 2017) \n(quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n  Plaintiffs assert that approximately 13,800 individuals receiving Disability \nWaivers live in corporate foster care facilities in Minnesota.  Acknowledging that not all \nof these individuals would fit within the proposed Class, Plaintiffs contend that \nDefendant’s own actions “make[] it difficult to identify the precise number of potential \nClass Members and the full scope of unnecessary segregation of persons in corporate \n6 \n \n\nfoster care facilities.”  (Doc. No. 37 at 13-14.)  However, Plaintiffs point to a 2016 DHS \nLead Agency Review of Hennepin County which Plaintiffs suggest illustrates that \napproximately five percent of DD waiver recipients living in CRS facilities in the county \n“may be better served in more individualized housing options.”  (Id. at 14.)  Thus, \nPlaintiffs estimate that the proposed Class would be made up of approximately 690 \nindividuals (5% of 13,800).3  Plaintiffs emphasize that they need not identify an exact \nnumber of Class Members and suggest that a class may be made up of as few as twenty \nindividuals.  Plaintiffs also assert that “the class is characterized by size, geographic \ndiversity, and disabling limitations that make joinder of all member impracticable.”  (Id. \nat 15.) \n  Defendant argues that “the proposed class members are not ascertainable.”  (Doc. \nNo. 45 at 10.)  Specifically, Defendant identifies a number of questions that would be \nnecessary for Plaintiffs to answer to evaluate whether an individual is a member of the \nclass and suggests that Plaintiffs have offered no support to the Court to answer these \nquestions.  For example, such questions include “Does the person live in a CRS?” and \n“Does the person want to live in a place other than a CRS?”  Defendant also suggests that \nascertaining the Class would require determining whether a CRS is the most integrated \nsetting for each person’s needs, whether he or she could afford another setting, and how \nlong each person has waited for services.  Regarding Plaintiffs’ proposed class size, \n                                                           \n3   Plaintiffs further suggest that the proposed class would likely be even larger \n(approximately 800 individuals) taking into account individuals on other Disability \nWaivers or individuals with high needs not accounted for in the DHS report on which \nthey rely.   \n7 \n \n\nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs mischaracterize the DHS report that they use to support \ntheir class estimate.  Defendant asserts that “Plaintiffs may not rely on mere speculation \nabout the size of the proposed class” and suggest that they “must at least provide a \nreasonable estimate.”  (Id. at 14-15.)   \n  In response, Plaintiffs argue that ascertainability is merely an implied judicial \nrequirement that applies with much less force in a Rule 23(b)(2) class.  Even if the Court \nconsiders ascertainability, Plaintiffs suggest, the proposed Class would meet this \nrequirement.  Specifically, Plaintiffs emphasize that their proposed Class can be \nascertained by objective criteria based on two components:  (1) “persons who are 18 and \nolder and eligible for and receiving a Waiver and live in corporate foster care,” and \n(2) “persons who want the choice and opportunity to live in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs.”  (Doc. No. 51 at 7.)  The answers to these questions, Plaintiffs \nargue, could be determined based on objective data available in Waiver program records.  \nWith regard to numerosity, Plaintiffs also contend that their proposed Class would meet \nthe numerosity requirement even if Plaintiffs relied on the figures in the DHS report that \nDefendant claims is relevant. \n  First, the Court considers the size of the proposed class.  Plaintiffs cite their \nAmended Complaint for the proposition that 13,800 Disability Waiver recipients are \nserved in CRS facilities in the state.  (See Doc. No. 37 at 13 (citing Doc. No. 33 (“Am. \nCompl.”) ¶ 65).)  In her Answer, Defendant provides updated figures “affirmatively \nstat[ing] that as of May 22, 2017, there are approximately 3,598 corporate foster care \nlicenses,” and that “[t]hese facilities are licensed to serve up to a capacity of \n8 \n \n\napproximately 13,500 Disability Waiver recipients.”  (Doc. No. 55 (“Answer”) ¶ 65.)  \nThe Court will rely on the updated figures to support that there are approximately 13,500 \nindividuals residing in CRS facilities throughout the State. \n  To narrow this large group of individuals to those who would fall within the \nproposed class of individuals who “have not been given the choice and opportunity to \nreside in the most integrated residential setting appropriate to their needs,” Plaintiffs \ndirect the Court to a March 2016 DHS Lead Agency Review report for Hennepin County.  \n(Doc. No. 38 (“Burke Aff.”) ¶ 6, Ex. 5.)  This report states that 93.7% of individuals on \nthe Developmental Disabilities (“DD”) Waiver in Hennepin County qualified as having \n“high needs” in 2014.  (Id. at 5-6.)  The report also identifies a total of 3,175 DD Waiver \nRecipients in Hennepin County in 2014.  (Id. at 5.)  Thus, approximately 6.3%, or \nroughly 200 individuals, would be characterized as having low needs.  (See id. at 5-6.)   \nNext, Plaintiffs’ data in the Lead Agency Review report indicates that 38.0% of \nDD Waiver recipients in Hennepin County received services in their own homes in 2014.  \n(Id. at 16.)  The remainder, the report suggests, would be served in “provider controlled \nhousing and residential settings.”  (Id.)  Specifically, the report notes that Hennepin \nCounty “utilizes residential services for the DD program” for 61% of individuals.  (Id.)  \nPlaintiffs appear to rely on these figures to support that roughly 1,969 DD Waiver \nRecipients in Hennepin County (62% of 3,175) reside in provider-controlled housing.  \n(See id. at 5, 16; see also Doc. No. 37 at 14.) \nThe Lead Agency Review report also states that “forty-nine percent of low need \npeople in the DD program currently reside in local corporate foster care homes” and \n9 \n \n\nnotes that “[i]t is possible that many of these individuals could live independently with \nsupports.”  (Burke Aff. ¶ 6, Ex. 5 at 22.)  Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that “nearly 100 \nof the approximately 1,969 people in Hennepin County receiving the DD waiver living in \nprovider controlled residential settings could be considered ‘low needs’ and may not need \nor want to be in such a setting.”  (Doc. No. 37 at 14.)  Plaintiffs propose that the Court \ncan extrapolate this figure (approximately 5%) statewide to all individuals residing in \nCRS facilities to estimate the class size.   \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the March 2016 Hennepin County Lead \nAgency Review provides a reasonable basis for identifying an estimated class size.  \nDHS’s own recommendation in this report indicates a possibility that “many of” the \napproximately one hundred individuals with low needs residing in CRS facilities “could \nlive independently with supports.”  (Burke Aff. ¶ 6, Ex. 5 at 22.)  The report also explains \nthat “[w]hen people are served in their own homes, they have more choices and are able \nto make more decisions in how they live their life.”  (Id. at 16.)  Thus, by DHS’s own \nestimates, this report appears to suggest that nearly 100 individuals were not evaluated \nregarding or offered an opportunity to reside in the most integrated setting appropriate to \ntheir needs, consistent with Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition.   \nFurther, the Court finds that this estimate supports certification of a statewide class \nnotwithstanding that the March 2016 report focused on Hennepin County alone.  First, \neven if the Court relied on only the approximately 100 individuals in Hennepin County as \nthe estimated class size, Defendant’s role in overseeing the Disability Waivers statewide \nwould support certification of a statewide class to remedy the alleged deficiencies in the \n10 \n \n\nprogram for all Disability Waiver recipients.  Second, the Court finds that the record \nsuggests Hennepin County is not alone in failing to assure choice and opportunity for \nindividuals seeking integrated housing alternatives to CRS facilities.  The March 2016 \nLead Agency Review for Hennepin County suggests that the county “has been \ndeliberate” in addressing independent housing alternatives “to ensure people have choice \nand receive services in the least restrictive setting.”  (Id. at 21.)  The report also notes that \nHennepin County has “work[ed] regionally with [its] neighboring counties to share ideas \nand resources.”  (Id.)  Regarding person-centered planning, one form of individualized \nhousing services which Plaintiffs seek in this case, the report describes Hennepin County \nas “a leader in the state.”  (Id.)  If even this county is failing to assure that individuals \nresiding in CRS facilities have informed choice about integrated housing alternatives, it is \nreasonable to conclude that other counties statewide face similar challenges.  Finally, a \nDHS Lead Agency Review Progress Report based on reviews of 37 lead agencies from \nAugust 2015 to September 2016 made the recommendation that 23 out 37 agencies (or \n62.2%) should “[d]evelop services that support people in their own homes,” including \n“[d]evelop[ing] service options for people wanting alternatives to foster care.”  (Burke \nAff. ¶ 5, Ex. 4 at 5, 39.)  This evidence further supports Plaintiffs’ suggestion that \nextrapolating the 5% estimate from Hennepin County statewide would provide a \nconservative estimate of class size sufficient to establish numerosity. \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately proposed a reasonable estimate for \ntheir proposed class to support numerosity.  Although Plaintiff’s numeric estimate based \non the circumstances in one county is not without its limitations, taking into account the \n11 \n \n\nadditional factors of the proposed class members’ disabilities and geographic dispersion \nthroughout the state, the Court is satisfied that the proposed class “is so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).4   \nSecond, the Court addresses Defendant’s arguments regarding ascertainability.  \nThe Court disagrees that the class is not sufficiently ascertainable.  First, the Court notes \nthat many of the questions Defendant identifies need not be answered at all to identify \nclass membership.  For example, the Court will not need to determine the individual \nliving preferences or most integrated setting of individuals residing in CRS facilities to \ndetermine the scope of the class.  As the Court discusses in more detail, below, Plaintiffs \nseek systemwide relief so that those determinations can be made in the context of \nDefendant’s own administration of the Waiver Services programs statewide.  As \nPlaintiffs suggest, the Court can ascertain class membership based simply on the \nobjective criteria of (1) whether an individual is currently in a CRS facility and \n(2) whether he or she has received an opportunity to reside in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to his or her needs.5  To be sure, the latter inquiry may be somewhat \nsubjective in nature as Plaintiffs appear to contest what constitutes adequate informed \n                                                           \n4   The Court declines to address the parties’ dispute over the proper data on which to \nrely in the DHS Lead Agency Review Progress Report, (see Doc. No. 38 (“Burke Aff.”) \n¶ 5, Ex. 4), because the Court finds that numerosity is satisfied even in the absence of this \ndata. \n \n5   As Plaintiffs point out, information relevant to the latter question can be \ndetermined based on the results documented in the service plans of individual Waiver \nServices recipients created by lead agencies pursuant to requirements established by \nDefendant.  (See Doc. No. 13 (“Welsh Aff.”) ¶ 6, Ex. 6.) \n12 \n \n\nchoice.  However, the Court agrees with the courts that have rejected or applied a relaxed \napproach to ascertainability in the context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class and finds that the \nproposed class is sufficiently ascertainable to support certification.  See Shelton, 775 F.3d \nat 561 (“Because the focus in a[ ](b)(2) class is more heavily placed on the nature of the \nremedy sought, and because a remedy obtained by one member will naturally affect the \nothers, the identities of individual class members are less critical in a[ ](b)(2) action than \nin a[ ](b)(3) action.”); see also Postawko, 2017 WL 3185155, at *6. \nThus, the Court finds that Rule 23(a)(1)’s numerosity requirement is satisfied. \nB.  Commonality \nSecond, a party seeking class certification must establish “that ‘there are questions \nof law or fact common to the class.’”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 349 (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2)).  In Wal-Mart, the Supreme Court clarified the commonality \nrequirement, explaining that “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the \nclass members ‘have suffered the same injury.’”  Id. at 349-50 (citation omitted).  More \nspecifically, “[t]heir claims must depend upon a common contention—for example, the \nassertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor.”  Id. at 350.  Further, \n“[t]hat common contention . . . must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide \nresolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id.  Elaborating on \nthis requirement, the Supreme Court explained that “[w]hat matters to class certification \n. . . is not the raising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but, rather the capacity of \n13 \n \n\na classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the \nlitigation.”  Id. (citation omitted).   \nPlaintiffs argue that the commonality requirement is met because Defendant’s \npolicies and practices in operating the state’s Waiver services program apply to the class \nas a whole and have contributed to the same harm of “unnecessary segregation” resulting \nfrom an overreliance on CRS facilities and the denial of individualized housing services.  \n(Doc. No. 37 at 18.)  The Plaintiffs identify the following “questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2), to establish commonality: \ni.  Whether the Defendants have failed to provide person-centered \nplanning and other individualized Waiver services in a system-wide \nuniform manner and whether such failure is a violation of Medicaid’s \nreasonable promptness requirement;  \n \nii.  Whether Plaintiffs are receiving written notice of adverse action and \nopportunity to challenge the failure to provide individualized housing \nservices and whether such failure is a violation of the Due Process \nClause of the United States Constitution and Plaintiffs’ Medicaid rights; \n \niii.  Whether the Defendants are violating the integration mandates of the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act by planning, administering, and operating \na residential services system that:  unnecessarily segregates Plaintiffs in \ncorporate foster care facilities and fails to provide informed choice of \nmore integrated alternatives; discriminates against the Plaintiffs by \nproviding residential services to them in settings that are not the most \nintegrated settings appropriate to their needs; and fails to provide the \nPlaintiffs with individualized housing Waiver services to allow them to \ntransition to and remain in the most integrated settings appropriate to \ntheir needs; and \n \niv.  Whether the Defendants have a comprehensive and effectively working \nplan for providing integrated residential services to the Plaintiffs. \n \n(Doc. No. 37 at 18-19.)  Plaintiffs argue that “commonality is not defeated by the \npresence of individual differences among class members” because the “putative class \n14 \n \n\nmembers share a common legal theory and challenge a common pattern and practice of \ndiscrimination.”  (Id. at 19.)  According to Plaintiffs, their rights to be free from needless \nsegregation and to receive Waiver services in a reasonably prompt manner “can only be \nproperly and fully vindicated in the context of a class action for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief.”  (Id. at 21.) \n  Defendant asserts that numerous differences among the proposed Class Members \ndefeat commonality.  Such differences include “their individual circumstances, whether \nthey have been injured, and the alleged cause of their injuries.”  (Doc. No. 45 at 15.)  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence of common questions of \nlaw or fact and emphasize that commonality is particularly important in classes certified \nunder Rule 23(b)(2).  With respect to all four common questions raised by the Plaintiffs, \nDefendant argues that each fails to satisfy commonality.  First, Defendant argues that “a \nviolation of Medicaid’s reasonable promptness requirement is not an injury capable of \nclasswide determination” because resolution of such a claim depends on the length of \ntime an individual has waited for services.  (Id. at 17.)  Second, Defendant argues that \nPlaintiffs have failed to provide evidence to show that all counties are failing to provide \nwritten notice as required by Defendant or that Defendant’s own policy or practice has \nresulted in the alleged denials of notice.  Third, with regard to Plaintiffs’ integration \nmandate claim, Defendant asserts that “Plaintiffs have no evidence that alleged \noverreliance on corporate foster care facilities has actually injured each putative class \nmember, as for some putative class members such a setting may be ‘the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs.’”  (Id. at 18.)  Defendant also notes that even if some \n15 \n \n\nproposed Class Members are not in the most integrated setting, there is no evidence to \nsuggest that this is a result of Defendant’s actions as opposed to other factors.  Fourth, \nDefendant asserts that Minnesota’s Olmstead Plan has been deemed sufficient by this \nCourt and reiterates that Plaintiffs have not tied the alleged injuries of the proposed Class \nMembers to any alleged deficiency in the Olmstead Plan.  In short, Defendant argues that \n“Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that each putative class member was \nharmed, that those allegedly harmed suffered the same injury, or that any such injury was \ncaused by the same generally applicable policy or action of Defendant such that the Court \ncan provide a remedy.”  (Id. at 19.)  Defendant emphasizes that individualized remedies \nconsistently defeat class-certification post-Wal-Mart.  Defendant also points out the \nindividual county-level determinations underlying Plaintiffs’ claims and assert that \n“Plaintiffs have not shown that some universally-applicable action of Defendant caused \nputative class members to suffer ‘the same injury’ such that determination of that actions’ \nlegality ‘will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in \none stroke.’”  (Id. at 21 (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 348-50).) \n  Plaintiffs argue that Wal-Mart is distinguishable because in this case, “the \nchallenge is directed to the public entity’s failure to plan, administer, and operate a \nresidential service system that allows persons with disabilities the choice and opportunity \nto live in integrated settings.”  (Doc. No. 51 at 8-9.)  Plaintiffs argue that a single \ninjunction could remedy this alleged failure for the Class as a whole.  Plaintiffs suggest \nthat their allegations focus not on individual county-level determinations but on \nDefendant’s overall management and direction of the Waiver programs.  Regarding \n16 \n \n\nreasonable promptness, Plaintiffs assert that the “lack of system-wide assurance to \nprovide the needed service that Plaintiffs allege is a central issue of Defendants’ \nliability.”  (Id. at 10.)  With respect to due process, Plaintiffs similarly contend that \nDefendant fails to ensure Wavier services recipients receive adequate notice relating to \nthe denial of individualized housing services available under the Waivers.  Finally, \nconcerning Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims, Plaintiffs point to an alleged “systemic \nfailure to provide proper direction and control over lead agencies” and emphasize \nDefendant’s responsibility for the State’s administration of the Waiver services program.  \nPlaintiffs also dispute Defendant’s reliance on Minnesota’s Olmstead Plan and argue that \nthe parties’ disagreement over the adequacy of the Olmstead Plan in fact supports that \nthere are common questions capable of Classwide resolution. \n  In Wal-Mart, the plaintiffs asserted Title VII employment discrimination claims \nbased on gender against Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 342-45.  The \nSupreme Court emphasized that “[t]he[] plaintiffs . . . [did] not allege that Wal-Mart has \nany express corporate policy against the advancement of women.”  Id. at 344.  Instead, \nthe plaintiffs alleged “that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination” \nbased on the company’s delegation of discretionary authority to local supervisors and an \nalleged “corporate culture” that resulted in biased employment decisions against women \nat Wal-Mart stores throughout the country.  Id. at 344-45, 352.  In evaluating \ncommonality, the Supreme Court explained that, “[i]n this case, proof of commonality \nnecessarily overlaps with respondents’ merits contention that Wal-Mart engages in a \npattern or practice of discrimination.  That is so because, in resolving an individual’s \n17 \n \n\nTitle VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is the reason for a particular employment \ndecision.”  Id. at 352 (footnote, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).  The \nSupreme Court noted that the plaintiffs in Wal-Mart sought “to sue about literally \nmillions of employment decisions at once.”  Id.  It concluded that, “[w]ithout some glue \nholding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say \nthat examination of all the class members’ claims for relief will produce a common \nanswer to the crucial question why was I disfavored.”  Id.  The Supreme Court gave two \nexamples of how commonality might be established in this context in an employment \ndiscrimination case—a discriminatory test administered by the employer or “[s]ignificant \nproof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination.”  Id. at 353 \n(citation omitted).   \nUnlike the plaintiffs in Wal-Mart, Plaintiffs here do not focus their claims on \nlocalized decisionmakers, so the Court does not need to identify evidence of specific \npolicies or practices to support the commonality of the classwide claims.6  \n                                                           \n6   To the extent evidence of such policies is needed to support certification, the Court \nnotes that the record includes examples of Defendant’s statewide policies affecting the \nprovision of individualized housing services under the Disability Waivers.  For example, \nDefendant issued the Person-Centered, Informed Choice and Transition Protocol in \nFebruary 2016, and this protocol is designed “to communicate expectations regarding \nperson-centered practices with its lead agency partners.”  (Doc. No. 47 (“Bartolic Aff.”) \n¶ 9, Ex. 2 at 1.)  The protocol includes, for example, an “Overarching Characteristic” that \n“Process results in the person living in the place of his or her own choice that matches his \nor her preferences, in the most integrated setting possible.”  (Id. at 8-9.)  These protocols \nand Defendant’s actions in enforcing them constitute a common policy or practice \napplicable to the statewide Waiver Services system that unites the classwide allegations \nagainst Defendant.   \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page) \n18 \n \n\nNotwithstanding possible differences in the county-level decisions made with respect to \nthe individual class members, those decisions are necessarily held together by the “glue” \nof the Defendant’s oversight authority and responsibility for administering the state’s \nDisability Waiver services system.  Defendant is the state agency responsible for \nensuring Minnesota’s compliance with the Medicaid Act in its provision of services.  See \n42 C.F.R. §§ 431.10(b), 431.10(e); Minn. Stat. §§ 256B.04, subd. 1; 256B.02, subd. 5.  In \naddition, as a public entity that receives federal funds, Defendant is obligated to comply \nwith the integration mandates of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n(“RA”) in administering the Disability Waivers.  See generally Murphy ex rel. Murphy v. \nMinn. Dep’t of Human Servs., Civ. No. 16-2623, 2017 WL 2198133, at *21 (D. Minn. \nMay 18, 2017).  Plaintiffs’ classwide claims directed at Defendant are thus dissimilar to \nthe classwide claims asserted against Wal-Mart.  Because Defendant has ultimate \nauthority and responsibility for the State’s Disability Waivers, Defendant cannot simply \nabdicate that responsibility by pointing to the actions of county-level decisionmakers.  \nSee Gray v. Golden Gate Nat’l Recreational Area, 279 F.R.D. 501, 519 (N.D. Cal. 2011), \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(Footnote Continued From Previous Page) \nIn addition, Defendant’s Lead Agency Review process also illustrates Defendant’s \nrole in overseeing the provision of Waiver Services statewide.  (Burke Aff. ¶ 5, Ex. 4 at \n8-9.)  Through this process, Defendant issues corrective actions and recommendations to \nlead agencies.  (See id. at 37-40.)  For example, during the Lead Agency Review \ncovering August 2015 to September 2016, Defendant recommended that 23 counties \n(62.2%) “[d]evelop service options for people wanting alternatives to foster care.”  (Id. at \n39.)  Whether Defendant’s practices in reviewing lead agencies effectively ensure the \nprovision of reasonably prompt individualized housing services and opportunities to \nreside in the most integrated setting are critical common questions underlying Plaintiffs’ \nclasswide claims. \n19 \n \n\nreconsideration granted in part, 866 F. Supp. 2d 1129 (“There is no dispute that overall \ngovernance of the GGNRA, including decisions affecting accessibility, is centrally \ncontrolled by the Park Superintendent. This is a very different situation than the \nnationwide, store-by-store, localized discretionary decision-making at issue in \nWal-Mart.”).  Thus, Wal-Mart is persuasive, but not dispositive regarding the Court’s \ncommonality analysis, below, evaluating whether each of Plaintiffs’ claims “depend upon \na common contention . . . that . . . is capable of classwide resolution.”  Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 350.   \n  First, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant has violated the Medicaid Act’s “reasonable \npromptness” requirement, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), by failing to ensure the timely \nprovision of individualized housing services available under the Disability Waivers.  The \nCourt previously concluded that Plaintiffs stated a claim under this provision because \nthey “adequately alleged that they are not being offered services in a reasonably prompt \nmanner based on arbitrary or nonexistent assessment criteria.”  Murphy ex rel. Murphy, \n2017 WL 2198133, at *16.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on guidance \nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggesting that “whether an \nindividual has a right to receive a certain service ‘is dependent on a finding that the \nindividual needs the service, based on appropriate assessment criteria that the State \ndevelops and applies fairly to all waiver enrollees.’”  Id. at *14-15 (citation omitted).  \nMedicaid regulations also require that states “[f]urnish Medicaid promptly to \nbeneficiaries without any delay caused by the agency’s administrative procedures.”  \n42 C.F.R. § 435.930(a).   \n20 \n \n\nPlaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim challenges Defendant’s statewide failure \nto appropriately oversee the provision of individualized housing services in all counties to \nensure that these services are “furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible \nindividuals.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8).  This challenge is common among all \nproposed class members and capable of resolution on a classwide basis because the \nCourt’s determination whether Defendant’s oversight of the program violates this \nprovision would resolve all of the individual class members’ claims “in one stroke.”  \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 350; see also Steward ex rel. Minor v. Janek, 315 \nF.R.D. 472, 481 (W.D. Tex. 2016) (identifying a question of law that would promote \nclasswide resolution of a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8)’s reasonable promptness \nprovision).  If the Court determines that Defendant’s management of the Disability \nWaivers statewide fails to ensure the reasonably prompt provision of individualized \nhousing services to individuals living in CRS facilities, the Court could remedy that \nsystemic challenge by requiring Defendant to establish appropriate criteria and \nprocedures for fairly providing available services to eligible individuals.  The individual \ndifferences of time that individuals may have been denied services do not defeat \ncommonality.  In fact, the fact that one Named Plaintiff has received some \nperson-centered planning while the others have not supports Plaintiffs’ overarching \ncontention that these services are being offered in an ad-hoc manner that is not \nreasonably prompt.  The Court concludes that this claim may properly be resolved on a \nclasswide basis.   \n21 \n \n\nSecond, Plaintiffs raise due process challenges under the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act.  As the Court noted in its previous \norder on Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, “[t]o state a procedural due process claim, a \nplaintiff must demonstrate:  (1) the existence of a constitutionally protected liberty or \nproperty interest; and (2) that the defendant deprived the plaintiff of that interest without \nconstitutionally adequate process.”  Murphy ex rel. Murphy, 2017 WL 2198133, at *17.  \nThe Court previously concluded that Plaintiffs, Disability Waiver recipients, had a \nconstitutionally protected interest in accessing individualized housing services.  Id. at \n*18.  This contention would plainly be applicable to the entire proposed class.  The Court \nalso determined “that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged inadequate procedural protections” \nbased on the three-factor test outlined in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).  See \nid. at *18-19.  Plaintiffs have also asserted a challenge to Defendant’s provision of notice \nunder the Medicaid Act’s fair hearing requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3).  Under \nthese requirements, Defendant is responsible for the statewide provision of adequate due \nprocess in connection with the provision of Medicaid services.   \nPlaintiffs’ due process claims are capable of Classwide resolution because the \nCourt can determine with respect to the class as a whole whether Defendant is fulfilling \nher statutory obligation to ensure that adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing is \nbeing afforded to Disability Waiver recipients throughout the state.  See Susan J. v. Riley, \n254 F.R.D. 439, 460 (M.D. Ala. 2008) (rejecting the argument that individualized \nanalysis precluded certification and noting that the relevant plaintiffs “seek to force the \nState to provide the notice and opportunity for a hearing to all applicants who are denied \n22 \n \n\neligibility, including all class members”).  It is not necessary for class certification to \nestablish that Defendant has caused any current failure on behalf of the counties to \ndeliver adequate notice.  Rather, if there is such a failure, the responsibility rests with \nDefendant as the administrator of the state’s Disability Waiver services program.7 \nThird, Plaintiffs allege violations of the integration mandates of the ADA and \nSection 504 of the RA.  Regulations implementing both the ADA and the RA include an \n“integration mandate” that requires states to “administer services, programs, and \nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals \nwith disabilities.”  See 28 C.F.R § 35.130(d); see also 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).  In Olmstead \nv. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court considered the ADA’s \nintegration mandate and held that “[u]njustified isolation . . . is properly regarded as \ndiscrimination based on disability.”  Id. at 597.  Under the ADA, “public entities must \n‘make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the \nmodifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,’ but can \navoid this obligation by ‘demonstrat[ing] that making the modifications would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.’”  Guggenberger v. \n                                                           \n7   The Court notes that questions regarding the adequacy of particular individual \nnotices that may have been received are not the types of questions capable of classwide \nresolution given the fact-specific inquiry needed to evaluate such questions and claims.  \nHowever, the Court finds that it can properly resolve Plaintiffs’ claims on a classwide \nbasis by answering the common question for all class members whether Defendant’s \npolicies and practices have failed to ensure the provision of adequate notice to individuals \nbeing denied individualized housing services available under the Waivers.   \n23 \n \n\nMinnesota, 198 F. Supp. 3d 973, 1023-24 (D. Minn. 2016) (quoting 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(7)).   \nThe Court previously determined that “Plaintiffs have adequately pled integration \nmandate claims under the ADA and the RA based on their allegations of being unduly \nsegregated in CRS facilities and not receiving Disability Waiver services ‘in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to [their] needs.’”  Murphy ex rel. Murphy, 2017 WL \n2198133, at *23 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) and citing 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d)).  Similar \nto their reasonable promptness claim, Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims focus on \nDefendant’s lack of oversight and failure to ensure the provision of available Disability \nWaiver services throughout the state.  As the Court previously noted in considering the \nplausibility of Plaintiffs’ claims, Plaintiffs assert that “[r]ather than require statewide \naccess to individualized housing services, Defendants provide impermissible discretion to \neach lead agency to choose whether to offer individualized housing services.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 27.)  According to Plaintiffs, “[t]his abdication of DHS’s responsibility to \nprovide and ensure choice prevents individuals receiving Disability Waiver services from \nreceiving an informed choice and opportunity to live in the most integrated setting.”  (Id.)  \nDetermining the validity of these contentions lodged against Defendant would resolve for \nall class members whether their right to receive services in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs has been protected.  See Kenneth R. ex rel. Tri-Cty. CAP, \nInc./GS, 293 F.R.D. at 267 (identifying as common questions capable of classwide \nresolution “whether there is a systemic deficiency in the availability of community-based \nservices, and whether that deficiency follows from the State’s policies and practices”).  \n24 \n \n\nThe possibility that not all class members would ultimately move out of a CRS facility—\nand even the possibility that a CRS facility is in fact the most integrated setting for some \nindividuals—does not defeat commonality.  Plaintiffs seek to avoid the common injury of \nunjustified or unnecessary segregation through a system that offers a choice and \nopportunity to transition to the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  These \nalleged injuries are thus capable of classwide resolution.   \nAs one court has noted in discussing post-Olmstead integration mandate cases, \n“[w]here a private action raises systemic issues, courts have uniformly granted class \ncertification to allow plaintiffs to pursue those claims, even after . . . Wal-Mart . . ., which \narguably tightened the standard for class certification.”  Thorpe v. District of Columbia, \n303 F.R.D. 120, 126 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation omitted); see also id. at 126 n.11 (collecting \ncases).  Specifically, in Lane v. Kitzhaber, 283 F.R.D. 587 (D. Or. 2012), an integration \nmandate case alleging systemic deficiencies in the state’s provision of integrated \nemployment opportunities, the court explained that “a class of disabled individuals \nseeking reasonable accommodation may be certified without the need for an \nindividualized assessment of each class member’s disability or the type of \naccommodation needed.”  Id. at 589-90, 594-95.  The Lane court explained:  \n[A]ll plaintiffs are qualified for, but not receiving the full benefit of, \nsupported employment services; all lack regular contact with non-disabled \npeers (other than paid staff); and all want to work, but are not working, in \nan integrated setting.  As a result, they and all similarly situated persons \nsuffer the same injury of unnecessary segregation in the employment \nsetting.  It is not necessary, as defendants contend, for plaintiffs to prove at \nthis stage that they and all putative class members are unnecessarily \nsegregated and would benefit from employment services. That is, in effect, \nthe answer to the common question and not the common question of \n25 \n \n\nwhether they are being denied supported employment services for which \nthey are qualified. \n \nId. at 598.  Plaintiffs assert similar claims here and have adequately established that these \nclaims are capable of classwide resolution. \nIn short, Plaintiffs have identified multiple “questions of law or fact common to \nthe class” that are capable of classwide resolution.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  \nTherefore, Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 23(a)(2). \nC.  Typicality \nThe third preliminary requirement for class certification is that “the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “This requirement is generally considered to be satisfied if the \nclaims or defenses of the representatives and the members of the class stem from a single \nevent or are based on the same legal or remedial theory.”  Paxton, 688 F.2d at 561-62 \n(quotation marks and citation omitted).  However, “[t]he presence of a common legal \ntheory does not establish typicality when proof of a violation requires individualized \ninquiry.”  Elizabeth M., 458 F.3d at 787.  Typicality and commonality “tend to merge” \nbecause “[b]oth serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular \ncircumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named \nplaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class \nmembers will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.”  Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 564 U.S. at 349, n.5 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157-58, \nn.13 (1982)). \n26 \n \n\nPlaintiffs argue that the typicality requirement is met because the Named \nPlaintiffs’ claims are based on the same conduct by Defendant and can be remedied in the \nsame manner as the claims of the entire proposed Class.  Plaintiffs emphasize that all \nproposed class members share the same “typical problem” of being “stuck in corporate \nfoster care.”  (Doc. No. 51 at 17.)  Plaintiffs also argue that the fact that some individuals \nmay be prevented from implementing individualized housing options does not bar class \ncertification.  Finally, they contend that individual differences in Waiver type or \ngeographic location do not defeat typicality or adequacy. \nDefendant contends that Plaintiffs fail to establish typicality because the Named \nPlaintiffs’ interests differ from those of the proposed Class.  For example, Defendant \nargues that Plaintiffs have not established that the proposed class members all wish to \nmove from their CRS facilities like the Named Plaintiffs.  Defendant also points out that \nthe three Named Plaintiffs reside in Hennepin County and that they do not represent all \ntypes of available waiver recipients. \nThe Court finds that the Named Plaintiffs’ claims “are typical of the claims . . . of \nthe class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  Specifically, Bottelson, Swanson, and Murphy all \nassert that they presently reside in CRS facilities and experience various levels of \nisolation and segregation from their communities in these settings.  (See Doc. No. 44 \n(“Bottelson Decl.”) ¶¶ 6, 10; Doc. No. 42 (“Swanson Decl.”) ¶¶ 4, 5-6; Doc. No. 43 \n(“Murphy Decl.”) ¶¶ 7-8, 10.)  In addition, like the proposed class, the Named Plaintiffs \nassert that they have been denied the choice and opportunity to access the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs by utilizing individualized housing services.  (Bottelson \n27 \n \n\nDecl. ¶¶ 8, 12-13; Swanson Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8-9; Murphy Decl. ¶¶ 14-16.)  Bottelson explains \nthat despite asking to move to her own apartment multiple times since 2013, “I have not \nbeen given more individualized or independent alternative options to consider.”  \n(Bottelson Decl. ¶ 8.)  Swanson has made similar requests but asserts that “[m]y case \nmanagers . . . have told me I am not ‘independent enough’ for such individualized \nhousing.”  (Swanson Decl. ¶ 5.)  Murphy’s co-guardian states that “[a]lthough I have \nasked several people at Hennepin County about accessing more individualized housing \noptions, [Murphy] remains stuck in a segregated setting.”  (Murphy Decl. ¶¶ 1, 14.)  The \nNamed Plaintiffs’ interests in this case are identical to those of the proposed class \nmembers as each seeks to require Defendant to implement the state’s Disability Waiver \nprograms in a manner that ensures access to available Disability Waiver services in a \nreasonably prompt manner, with adequate notice, and in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs.  \nAs the Court concluded with respect to commonality, individualized inquiries are \nnot necessary to determine Defendant’s liability for the alleged violations of federal law \nbecause Plaintiffs’ challenges focus on Defendant’s actions and inactions applied to the \nsystem as a whole.  Furthermore, the Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical even though \nproposed class members may be eligible for individualized housing services under \ndifferent Disability Waivers administered in different counties.  Cf. Susan J., 254 F.R.D. \nat 460 (rejecting the argument “that certification of a statewide class may be \ninappropriate because the [local county agency] may be doing a particularly bad job of \nserving people” and noting that “[t]his argument overlooks the fact that it is the State’s \n28 \n \n\nMedicaid plan that is required to comply with Federal Law”).  It is also no bar to \ncertification that some individuals in the proposed class may not want to move out of a \nCRS facility because the requested relief is aimed at providing opportunities to access \nmore integrated alternatives, and it is immaterial whether all proposed class members will \nultimately take advantage of those opportunities. \nBecause Plaintiffs’ claims stem from the same legal theory and seek the same \nlegal remedy as the proposed class, Plaintiffs satisfy Rule 23(a)(3). \nD.  Adequacy \nRule 23(a)(4) requires plaintiffs to establish that “the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).8  In \nevaluating this requirement, courts must “clearly inquire into whether the named \nrepresentatives (1) ‘have common interests with the members of the class [;]’ and \n(2) ‘will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.’”  In re \nTarget Corp., 847 F.3d at 613 (quoting Paxton, 688 F.2d at 562-63).  Furthermore, “the \ncourt must diligently aim to ‘uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the \nclass they seek to represent.’”  Id. (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. \n591, 625 (1997)). \nPlaintiffs assert that they are represented by competent counsel and “will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class in this action.”  (Doc. No. 37 at 24.)  \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to appoint as class counsel attorneys from the Minnesota \n                                                           \n8   Rule 23(g)(4) also provides that “[c]lass counsel must fairly and adequately \nrepresent the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(4).   \n29 \n \n\nDisability Law Center, a division of Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid and the law firm of \nAnthony Ostlund Baer & Louwagie, P.A.  The Named Plaintiffs also declare that their \ninterests are “common and coextensive” with the proposed class.  (Id.)  They contend that \n“[b]ecause all Class Members seek to receive individualized transition plans and an \nopportunity to implement those plans by moving to the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs, they will all benefit from the prospective injunctive relief in \nthis case.”  (Id. at 24-25.)  The Named Plaintiffs also attest that they will responsibly \nserve as class representatives in this matter.  (See Bottelson Decl. ¶ 14; Swanson Decl. \n¶ 10; Murphy Decl. ¶ 17.)  Defendant does not assert a particular challenge to the \ncompetency of proposed class counsel and makes the same arguments against adequacy \nas those made with respect to typicality.   \nThe Court finds that the Named Plaintiffs have met the requirements of \nRule 23(a)(4).  Consistent with the Court’s analysis of both the commonality and \ntypicality requirements, above, the Court finds that the Named Plaintiffs assert injuries \nthat are common to and typical of those alleged on behalf of the proposed class—\nunjustified isolation and segregation in CRS facilities and denial of available Disability \nWaiver services.  Thus, both the Named Plaintiffs and the proposed class members share \nthe common goals of obtaining Disability Waiver services in a reasonably prompt manner \nand pursuing appropriate integration into their communities.  The Court acknowledges \nthat the individualized housing services Plaintiffs seek may be drawn from a limited pool \nof available resources, suggesting a potential conflict of interest among those seeking to \naccess these services.  However, the Named Plaintiffs and the proposed class would all \n30 \n \n\nbenefit from the remedies they seek in the form of a more consistent and equitable \ndistribution of resources statewide.  Thus, to the extent there is any conflict of interest, \nthe Court determines that it is insufficient to preclude certification of this proposed class \nseeking systemic injunctive relief to improve Defendant’s oversight of the state’s \nDisability Waiver services system.  The Court also finds that counsel for the Named \nPlaintiffs are qualified to assist the Named Plaintiffs in serving as class representatives \nand vigorously advancing the goals of the class.  Along with detailing their qualifications \nto represent the class in declarations to the Court, (see Doc. Nos. 40, 41), counsel for the \nNamed Plaintiffs have also vigorously represented the interests of the Named Plaintiffs \nand the proposed class in the months since this litigation began.  See Första AP-Fonden \nv. St. Jude Med., Inc., 312 F.R.D. 511, 516 (D. Minn. 2015). \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have established adequacy under Rule 23(a)(4). \nIII.  Rule 23(b) \nAlong with meeting the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), a party seeking class \ncertification must also satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth under Rule 23(b).  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b).  In this case, Plaintiffs seek certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class.  \nUnder this provision, certification is proper “if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if . . . the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, \nso that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting \nthe class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n“[C]ohesiveness is the touchstone of a (b)(2) class, as a (b)(2) class ‘share[s] the \nmost traditional justification[ ] for class treatment,’ in that ‘the relief sought must \n31 \n \n\nperforce affect the entire class at once.’”  Ebert, 823 F.3d at 480 (quoting Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 361-62).  Since class members cannot opt out of a(b)(2) class and \nthere is no requirement for the court to provide notice, “the cohesiveness requirement of \nRule 23(b)(2) is more stringent than the predominance and superiority requirements for \nmaintaining a class action under Rule 23(b)(3).”  Id.  “Injuries remedied through (b)(2) \nactions are really group, as opposed to individual injuries. The members of a (b)(2) class \nare generally bound together through ‘preexisting or continuing legal relationships’ or by \nsome significant common trait such as race or gender.”  In re St. Jude Med., Inc., 425 \nF.3d at 1122 (quoting Holmes v. Cont’l Can Co., 706 F.2d 1144, 1155 n.8 (11th Cir. \n1983)). \nPlaintiffs argue that class certification is proper under Rule 23(b)(2) because \n“class-wide relief will address the two broad areas of Defendants’ illegal conduct,” \nincluding the failure to provide reasonably prompt waiver services with adequate due \nprocess and subjecting Plaintiffs to needless segregation.  (Doc. No. 37 at 26.)  By \naccessing individualized housing services, developing individualized transition plans, and \nhaving opportunities to implement these plans, Plaintiffs argue, “individuals would \nfinally be able to plan for, look for, move into, and live in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs.”  (Doc. No. 37 at 26-27.)  Plaintiffs argue that all class \nmembers would benefit from the requested injunctive and declaratory relief. \nDefendant argues that certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper where the \nplaintiffs seek individualized relief.  According to Defendant, Plaintiffs seek “highly \nindividualized relief” in the form of individualized person-centered planning, \n32 \n \n\nindividualized housing services, and opportunities to implement those individualized \nservices.  (Doc. No. 45 at 25.)  Defendant points out that “some class members have \nreceived person-centered planning—including Ms. Bottelson—and some may not have,” \nand “[s]ome are already in their most integrated setting, and Plaintiffs allege some are \nnot.”  (Id. at 26.)  Defendant argues that the Court could not issue an order in this case \nthat affects the proposed Class at the same time, rendering certification improper under \nRule 23(b)(2).  Finally, Defendant asserts that the relief Plaintiffs seek violates principles \nof federalism and the separation of powers. \nPlaintiffs contend that they do not ask the Court to impose individualized relief \nsuch as “deciding the support plan for each class member” or “issuing individualized \ninjunctions detailing the treatment needs of each class member, displacing Minnesota’s \nassessment and planning process, or mandating that Plaintiffs receiving housing of their \nchoice.”  (Doc. No. 51 at 18.)  Plaintiffs also dispute Defendant’s argument that their \nrequested relief violates federalism or the separation of powers. \nThe Court finds that the proposed class may be properly certified under \nRule 23(b)(2) because this case centers on Defendant’s conduct in administering the \nDisability Waivers statewide.  In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant fails to \nensure the reasonably prompt provision of individualized housing services, fails to ensure \nthat services are provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to individuals’ needs, \nand fails to ensure that Disability Waiver recipients receive adequate procedural due \nprocess protections.  As the Court has previously explained in a separate case, “the \nCommissioner has ultimate responsibility for the State’s provision of Waiver Services \n33 \n \n\nunder both federal Medicaid law and Minnesota statutes.”  Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. \n3d at 1034 (citing 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.10(b), 431.10(e), 435.903; Minn. Stat. §§ 256.01, \nsubd. 2(a); 256B.04, subd. 1; 256B.05, subd. 1).  Thus, the class comprises a cohesive \ngroup of similarly situated individuals receiving Disability Waivers and residing in CRS \nfacilities whose circumstances are impacted by Defendant’s actions and inactions with \nrespect to the class as a whole.   \nFurther, if Plaintiffs’ claims are ultimately successful, the Court finds “that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as \na whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The Court acknowledges that Plaintiffs seek \nindividualized services in order to obtain individualized housing options.  However, \nPlaintiffs do not seek individualized injunctive relief for each class member.  Rather, \nPlaintiffs seek final relief that would enable them to access individualized housing \nservices and integrated residential settings through improvements to Defendant’s \nadministration of the Disability Waivers.   \nFinally, the Court addresses Defendant’s arguments regarding federalism and the \nseparation of powers.  The Eighth Circuit has acknowledged the importance of carefully \nevaluating class certification and jurisdiction “before certifying a class seeking broad \ninjunctive relief against a state agency.”  Elizabeth M., 458 F.3d at 784.  The Court \nincorporates its previous analysis regarding the important federalism and separation of \npowers considerations at issue in this matter, see Murphy ex rel. Murphy, 2017 WL \n2198133, at *25-27, and determines that these considerations do not justify denying \ncertification of the proposed class. \n34 \n \n\nAs a result of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that this class is \nproperly certified under Rule 23(b)(2).   \nCONCLUSION \n  Resolving Plaintiffs’ claims in the context of a class action will fairly promote the \ninterests of the class and will ensure judicial economy.  In addition, because this matter \nseeks to reform Defendant’s statewide administration of Disability Waiver services to all \nindividuals over age 18 residing in CRS facilities, a class action will permit the parties to \nlitigate issues common to the class in an economical manner while avoiding duplicative \nlitigation.  The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2), and the Court certifies the proposed class. \nORDER \n  Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (Doc. No. [35]) is GRANTED. \n2.  The following class is certified pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure:  All individuals age 18 and older who are eligible for and have received \na Disability Waiver, live in a licensed Community Residential Setting, and have not been \ngiven the choice and opportunity to reside in the most integrated residential setting \nappropriate to their needs. \n3.  Having considered the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4), the Court appoints \nTenner Murphy, by his guardians Kay and Richard Murphy; Marrie Bottelson; and \nDionne Swanson as class representatives. \n35 \n \n\n4.  Having considered the requirements of Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, the Court appoints Sean B. Burke, Justin H. Perl, Joseph W. Anthony, \nSteven M. Pincus, and Peter J. McElligott as class counsel. \nDated:  September 29, 2017    s/Donovan W. Frank \n            DONOVAN W. FRANK \n            United States District Judge \n36 \n ",

Specifically, choosing where to live – a \nchoice most of us take for granted. But Plaintiffs, who are individuals with disabilities, \nhave been denied this most basic choice. The Minnesota Department of Human Services \n(“DHS”) has promised for many years to “help[] people move to more integrated settings, \nhomes that they choose,” (DHS Advertisement, ACCESS PRESS, September, 2015) but it \nhas failed to give Plaintiffs and hundreds of similarly situated individuals the opportunity \nto meet that goal. Defendants established and maintain a discriminatory residential \nservice system that funnels individuals with disabilities into segregated housing while \nrestricting their ability to move to more integrated settings of their own choice. \n \n1503-0404974-1681073.docx \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 2 of 38\n \nPlaintiffs in this class action lawsuit are individuals with disabilities who want to \nbe integrated into their communities, like people without disabilities, but have been \ndenied the opportunity due to the actions and inactions of Defendants. The Class consists \nof individuals who are receiving a Medicaid Home and Community Based Disability \nWaiver (“Disability Waiver”) and are living in a Community Residential Setting (“CRS”) \nfacility, but want to live elsewhere and be integrated into their community. Instead, \nDefendants have needlessly segregated the Individual Plaintiffs and Class Members \n(collectively referred to as the “Plaintiffs”) away from their family, friends, and the \ncommunities in which they wish to live.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n1.  Plaintiffs have various disabilities, including but not limited to \ndevelopmental, physical, and mental health disabilities, as well as brain injuries.   \n2.  Each Plaintiff receives a Disability Waiver to pay for services. The main \npurposes of the Disability Waiver are to enable Plaintiffs to interact with the larger \nnondisabled community and to allow them to live where they want and with whom they \nwant. \n3.  Defendants’ management of the Disability Waivers has failed to achieve \nthese purposes. Instead, Defendants have created, maintained, and over-relied on a \nresidential service system that limits individual autonomy, choice, and integration. This \nsystem violates the integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”) which requires Defendants to “administer services, programs, and activities in \n2 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 3 of 38\n \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n4.  Defendants’ overreliance on services provided in CRS facilities results in \nthe segregation of Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs demand that Defendants offer an informed choice \nand realistic opportunity to receive residential services in the most integrated setting. \n5.  Defendant DHS defines segregated settings as “congregate settings \npopulated exclusively or primarily with individuals with disabilities . . . [and] \ncharacterized by regimentation in daily activities [and] limits on individuals’ ability to \nengage freely in community activities.” Minnesota Olmstead Plan: Demographic \nAnalysis, Segregated Settings Counts, Targets and Timelines, September 20, 2014, p. 8. \n6.  Many of Defendants’ sanctioned CRS facilities are segregated settings \nbecause Plaintiffs are limited in who they can live and associate with. They are also \nlimited in where and how they spend their leisure time, how their days are structured, and \nwhat opportunities they are given to interact with people outside the CRS facility. CRS \nfacilities contain up to five persons, all with disabilities, living in a residence that is \nowned, leased, operated, and/or controlled by the same organization that provides the \nservices. Consequently, Defendants do not provide Plaintiffs with adequate individual \nchoices necessary to allow them to live in the most integrated setting. \n7.  In contrast to the CRS model, individualized housing uses Disability \nWaiver services, including person-centered planning, to design and implement a \ncustomized setting for the individual to live, work, and enjoy leisure time in the most \nintegrated setting. \n3 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 4 of 38\n \n8.  Person-centered planning is “an organized process of discovery and action \nmeant to improve a person’s quality of life . . . [designed to ensure people] the right and \nopportunity to . . . develop and maintain relationships; make choices about their daily \nlives; and achieve their personal goals.” Minnesota Olmstead Plan, August 10, 2015 p. \n33. \n9.  Person-centered planning, when facilitated by a trained person-centered \nplanner, enables individuals to develop comprehensive individualized transition plans.   \n10.  As part of their Disability Waiver services, Plaintiffs are entitled to hire a \ntrained person-centered planner. Plaintiffs need such services in order to develop a \ncomprehensive individualized transition plan to move to more integrated housing.  \n11.  Defendants’ actions and inactions have denied Plaintiffs the opportunity to \nfind trained person-centered planners, to receive services from a person-centered planner \nin a timely fashion, or to receive any such services in order to develop and implement \ncomprehensive individualized transition plans. \n12.  Even if Plaintiffs are eventually enabled to develop comprehensive \nindividualized transition plans, Defendants’ failure to reasonably modify its residential \nservice system prevents Plaintiffs from implementing their transition plans and living in \nthe most integrated setting. \n13.  Although Plaintiffs are capable of living in a more integrated setting, \nDefendants’ administration, operation, and oversight (or lack thereof) has led to a \npervasive overreliance on segregated CRS facilities. Defendants discriminate against \nPlaintiffs by failing to provide integrated individualized housing services that would \n4 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 5 of 38\n \nenable them to have the choice and realistic opportunity to live in the most integrated \nsetting. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, as enforced by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983; Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 and 12131 et seq., and implementing \nregulations; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and implementing regulations; \nand the Medicaid Act 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a et seq., and implementing regulations, as \nenforced by 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n15.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction over the claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, and has original jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1343(a)(3) and (4). \n16.  Venue is proper in the District of Minnesota pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1391(b), as the conduct alleged is occurring in this District. \nTHE PARTIES \nThe Individual Plaintiffs \n17.  Tenner Murphy is a 33-year-old resident of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \n18.  Kay and Richard Murphy are the parents and legal guardians of Tenner \nMurphy and are residents of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \n19.  Marrie Bottelson is a 42-year-old resident of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \n20.  Dionne Swanson is a 43-year old resident of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \n \n5 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 6 of 38\n \nThe Defendants \n21.  Defendant DHS is the statewide agency charged with overseeing and \nsetting policies for Minnesota’s Medicaid programs. This includes the Disability Waivers \nand residential services for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities, \ntraumatic brain injury, mental illness, and other disabilities. \n22.  DHS is a public entity subject to Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. DHS receives federal funds for the administration of its programs.    \n23.  Defendant Emily Johnson Piper is the Commissioner of DHS. She is \nresponsible for administering and managing the Disability Waiver programs. She also \noversees the licensing and monitoring of residential services providers, including those \nthat own and operate CRS facilities. Defendant Piper is sued in her official capacity. \nSTATEMENTS OF FACT \n24.  Defendants administer four community service waiver programs for \npersons with disabilities: the Developmental Disabilities (“DD”) Waiver, the Community \nAccess for Disability Inclusion (“CADI”) Waiver, the Community Alternative Care \n(“CAC”) Waiver, and the Brain Injury (“BI”) Waiver (collectively referred to as the \n“Disability Waivers”). Defendants submit these Disability Waivers to the Federal \nGovernment and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) approves \nthem.   \n25.  The Disability Waivers are funded by federal and state dollars, pursuant to \nSection 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. These Disability Waivers allow Defendants to \nprovide a variety of services with Medicaid funding, such as residential support services, \n6 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 7 of 38\n \nwithout having to meet certain Medicaid statutory requirements. The Disability Waivers \ncan fund a variety of residential services, including individualized housing services. \nServices under the Disability Waivers are public programs, services, and activities \ncovered by Title II of the ADA. \n26.  Defendants manage Disability Waiver services in a manner that \ndisproportionately provides residential services in segregated, rather than individualized \nand integrated, settings.  \n27.  Defendants direct and manage counties, which serve as lead agencies, for \npurposes of administering many health and social services programs, including Disability \nWaiver services. Rather than require statewide access to individualized housing services, \nDefendants provide impermissible discretion to each lead agency to choose whether to \noffer individualized housing services. Most counties do not offer individualized housing \nservices. This abdication of DHS’s responsibility to provide and ensure choice prevents \nindividuals receiving Disability Waiver services from receiving an informed choice and \nopportunity to live in the most integrated setting. \n28.  Defendants have failed to inform all persons receiving a Disability Waiver \nof individualized housing service options and have failed to explain how to access such \nservices. Defendants have also failed to provide transition planning and support for such \nservices. Defendants have further failed to provide notices of denial or information \nregarding due process rights in regards to requests for these services. \n29.  Plaintiff Tenner Murphy has severe physical and cognitive disabilities as a \nresult of a lifelong battle with degenerative brain cancer. \n7 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 8 of 38\n \na.  Despite his condition, he graduated from high school envisioning living a \ntypical adult life pursuing relationships, a job, activities and interests, and \nhis own place to live. \nb.  As his disability progressed during his twenties, he stayed in his parents’ \nhome where his family acted as his primary caretakers. \nc.  Mr. Murphy developed hobbies, such as archery, and had many \nnondisabled friends in the community. \nd.  In 2010, Mr. Murphy’s physical needs became more difficult to manage, \nand his parents made the difficult decision to look for an out-of-home \nplacement. \ne.  Mr. Murphy’s case manager at the time told Mr. Murphy and his family \nthat he could receive a Disability Waiver in order to move into a CRS \nfacility.   \nf.  When he moved into his CRS facility, Mr. Murphy was walking on a \nregular basis. But the CRS staff now make him use a wheelchair because \nthere is often not enough staff available or willing to assist him when he \nwants to walk. \ng.  On a typical day, Mr. Murphy spends most of his time alone, even though \nhe would prefer to interact with other people. He will often spend several \nhours sitting on the deck, the porch, or the dining room table by himself.   \nh.  Because of distance and staffing patterns at the CRS facility, he rarely goes \nto the archery range. He no longer follows his favorite television news \n8 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 9 of 38\n \nprograms because his preferred shows are broadcast at a time when house \nrules prohibit television watching. \ni.  Mr. Murphy has no control about how staff members are hired or trained \nand has no control of what housemates are moved into the facility. \nj.  The other residents in the CRS facility have difficulty communicating and \nMr. Murphy rarely speaks or interacts with them. Because he enjoys \nmeeting new people and conversing with others, Mr. Murphy wants to be \nable to choose his own roommates.   \nk.  Although Kay Murphy, Mr. Murphy’s mother and legal guardian, has asked \nseveral people at the lead agency about accessing more individualized \nhousing options, Mr. Murphy remains stuck in a segregated setting, where \nhis interactions are largely limited to other persons with disabilities and \npaid staff.  \nl.  Despite receiving no information from Defendants about Mr. Murphy’s \nright to live in his own home, Mr. Murphy’s family recently purchased a \nnew housing unit, with the hopes of having Mr. Murphy move into it with \nroommates of his choosing.   \nm. Despite this positive advancement, Mr. Murphy is still stuck in the CRS \nfacility because of Defendants’ failure to provide an informed choice of \nintegrated alternatives.

For the past several years, she has asked the different case managers she \nhas had to help her move into her own apartment with her current \nroommate and best friend, Dionne Swanson. Her case managers and county \nworkers, however, have told Ms. Bottelson that there are no other options \nfor her. \ne.  Because of staffing patterns in the facility, Ms. Bottelson is forced to go to \nbed at 7 or 8 p.m. because there is no other way for her to receive necessary \ncare. \nf.  Staffing patterns also dictate how much time Ms. Bottelson can spend in \nthe community.

To be as independent as possible, Ms. Bottelson would like to hire her own \nstaff and live in her own apartment. One of her goals is to continue building \nher art business, and she would like space in her own home to set up a \nsmall art studio to more easily work from home. \nh.  Ms. Bottelson would like to live with her best friend and current roommate, \nDionne Swanson. Together, they have often talked of finding an apartment \nor other small residence. She needs person-centered planning to help her \ndevelop an individualized moving plan and other individualized housing \nservices in order to make these goals a reality. \ni.  Ms. Bottelson’s previous case managers told her several times that \nindividualized housing is not a possibility for her, even though she lived in \nher own apartment for nearly ten years before moving into her current CRS.  \nj.  In 2013 Ms. Bottelson asked her previous case manager to help her find \nindividualized housing as an alternative to her CRS facility. She was told \nthat such housing was too hard to find, and has not been given alternative \noptions to consider.  \nk.

Medicaid is a healthcare and related services program jointly operated and \nfunded by the federal government and each participating state. Once a state chooses to \nparticipate, it must operate its program in compliance with federal statutory and \nregulatory requirements. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a. The State of Minnesota has chosen to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program. \n33.  Minnesota’s Disability Waiver services are Medicaid services that provide \na comprehensive, cost-effective, home and community-based package of services for \nindividuals with disabilities, such as Plaintiffs. They allow individuals to receive services \noutside of institutional settings such as nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities \nfor persons with developmental disabilities.   \n34.  Disability Waiver services include a wide array of services and supports, \nsuch as direct care staffing, vocational skills and employment assistance, environmental \nmodifications and other assistive technology, transitional and housing assistance, and \nother services designed to help people with disabilities live in his or her own home and \ninteract with the larger nondisabled community. \n35.  Medicaid requires the provision of services with reasonable promptness. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) and 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(a). \n36.  42 U.S.C. § 1983 entitles Plaintiffs to enforce provisions of Defendant \nDHS’s Medicaid Act obligations, including 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8). \n13 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 14 of 38\n \n37.  Constitutional Due Process requirements mandate that Defendants provide \nproper notice prior to adverse actions and access to fair hearings. Medicaid also requires \nthe provision of notice and due process requirements, including a fair hearing when \nservices are not provided with reasonable promptness. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 entitles Plaintiffs to enforce these requirements. \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act \n38.  The ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The Rehabilitation Act similarly prohibits \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities by entities that receive federal financial \nassistance. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n39.  In 1990, Congress enacted the ADA “to provide a clear and comprehensive \nnational mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). Among the specific issues the ADA addresses are \nactions that prevent persons with disabilities from “fully participat[ing] in all aspects of \nsociety” and “relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other \nopportunities.” Id. §§ 12101(a)(1), (5). \n40.  In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “historically, society has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, \nsuch forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious \nand pervasive social problem.” Id. § 12101(a)(2). \n14 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 15 of 38\n \n41.  Congress also found that “people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an \ninferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, \neconomically, and educationally; [and] the Nation’s proper goals regarding individuals \nwith disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals.” Id. §§ 12101(a)(6), (7). \n42.  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by \npublic entities. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. A “public entity” is any state or local government and \nany department, agency, or other instrumentality of a state or local government, and \ncovers all services, programs, and activities provided or made available by public entities, \nincluding through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements. See id. §§ 12131(1), \n12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130. Accordingly, Title II’s coverage extends to the state of \nMinnesota, Defendants’ agencies, and Defendants’ residential service system and \nDisability Waiver programs. \n43.  Congress directed the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing \nTitle II of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12134. \n44.  The Title II regulations require public entities to “administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). This is known as the \nintegration mandate. The Rehabilitation Act contains a similar requirement. Id. § \n41.51(d). \n15 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 16 of 38\n \n45.  The “most integrated setting” is one that “enables individuals with \ndisabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible . . . .” 28 \nC.F.R. § Pt. 35, App. A (2010). \n46.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), also prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. Section 504’s implementing regulations provide \nthat recipients of federal funds “shall administer programs and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.” 28 C.F.R. § \n41.51(d). \nOlmstead v. L.C. \n47.  The Supreme Court has held that Title II prohibits the unjustified \nsegregation of individuals with disabilities. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999). \n48.  The Supreme Court’s holding in Olmstead affirmed that segregation of \ndisabled persons is inconsistent with the interest of community integration and impedes \ncertain daily activities to which they are entitled to participate: “First, institutional \nplacement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates \nunwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of \nparticipating in community life.” Id. at 600. “Second, confinement in an institution \nseverely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, \nsocial contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and \ncultural enrichment.” Id. at 601. \n49.  Under Olmstead, public entities are required to provide community-based \nservices when (a) such services are appropriate, (b) the affected persons do not oppose \n16 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 17 of 38\n \ncommunity-based treatment, and (c) community-based services can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the entity and the needs of \nother persons with disabilities.  Id. at 607. \nHome and Community Based Services: Community Setting Rule \n50.  In January 2014, the CMS published a final administrative rule defining a \ncommunity setting for the purposes of Home and Community Based Services (“HCBS”). \n42 CFR § 441.301(c). \n51.  In order to comply with the rule, all persons receiving a Disability Waiver \nin Minnesota must receive services in a setting that, among other things, is: “selected by \nthe individual from among options, including non-disability purposed housing; integrated \nin and supports full access to the greater community; optimizes autonomy and \nindependence in making life choices; facilitates choice regarding services and who \nprovides them.” 42 CFR § 441.301(c)(4). \n52.  This rule is intended to “ensure that the setting chosen by the individual is \nintegrated in, and supports full access of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS to the \ngreater community, including opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive \nintegrated settings, engage in community life, control personal resources, and receive \nservices in the community to the same degree of access as individuals not receiving \nMedicaid HCBS.” 42 CFR § 441.301(c)(2)(i). \nThe Minnesota Olmstead Plan \n53.  Pursuant to a 2011 Stipulated Class Action Settlement Agreement arising \nout of a lawsuit filed in Minnesota Federal District Court, the State of Minnesota and \n17 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 18 of 38\n \nDefendant DHS agreed to develop and implement an Olmstead Plan. Defendants \nsubmitted their most recent draft on August 10, 2015. The Court approved the plan on \nSeptember 29, 2015. Corresponding “Work Plans” were approved by the Court on \nNovember 6, 2015.  \n54.  Neither the Olmstead Plan nor the Work Plans addresses CRS facilities or \nindividualized housing services. Nor do they describe how DHS plans to provide \nresidential services in more integrated settings for persons stuck in a CRS facility. \n55.  In its Orders approving the Olmstead plan and the Work Plans, the Court \nreserved jurisdiction over implementation of the plan and the Work Plans. Jensen v. \nMDSH, Order, 14-15, September 29, 2015; Jensen v. MDSH, Order, 3, November 3, \n2015. \n56.  In March, 2016, as part of the Olmstead Plan, Defendants released their \nPerson-Centered, Informed Choice and Transition Protocols (“Protocols”) as a guide for \nlead agencies. Defendants claim the Protocols are designed to communicate DHS’s \nexpectations to lead agencies regarding person-centered practices. \n57.  Although Defendants require lead agencies to implement the Protocols, \nthey have failed to directly inform persons in CRS facilities about person-centered \nplanning services and other individualized housing services that would allow them to \nmove to a more integrated setting.     \n58.  These expectations about person-centered principles and practices in the \nProtocols are purposefully broad, designed to apply to all populations who receive long-\nterm services from Defendants. They only provide generalized suggestions, rather than \n18 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 19 of 38\n \nenforceable requirements, for lead agencies to consider when someone receiving services \nis moving from one setting to another.  As such, the Protocols do not ensure Plaintiffs \naccess to a trained person-centered planner who is able to help develop a comprehensive \nindividualized moving plan.   \n59.  While Defendants claim the Protocols are useful to helping change general \nculture and practice within Defendants’ service system, they are not designed to help \nPlaintiffs move into the most integrated setting and therefore, they are not sufficient. \nThey fail to direct or provide any guidance as to how lead agencies and individuals with \ndisabilities can actually receive services in the most integrated setting.   \n60.  In earlier drafts of the Olmstead Plan, DHS identified some specific \nindividualized housing services, such as Individualized Housing Options (“IHO”), as \nassistance to help people move to and remain in the most integrated setting. In the current \nplan, however, Defendants have eliminated all references to IHO. The Protocols are \nsimilarly silent on how individuals are supposed to learn about, develop, plan for, move \ninto, and remain in individualized and integrated alternatives to segregated settings. \n61.  Nothing in the Protocols, the Olmstead Plan, or the Work Plans indicates \nhow DHS will reduce its overreliance on CRS facilities by providing appropriate services \nto people entitled to more integrated alternatives than CRS facilities, as required under \nthe integration mandates of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n62.  While Defendants have promised, in the Olmstead Plan, to move 5,547 \npeople into more integrated settings, there are very few details of how or when this will \n19 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 20 of 38\n \nhappen, where these persons will come from (including whether or not they will come \nfrom CRS settings), or how and if they will be informed of the purported options.   \n63.  Defendants lack a working plan with accurate data, details, and measurable \ngoals to:  \na.  Specifically address how to fix its residential service system that over-relies \non CRS facilities to the detriment of integrated alternatives such as \nindividualized housing services; and  \nb.  Ensure that Individual Plaintiffs and Class Members are receiving services \nin the most integrated settings. \nMINNESOTA’S RESIDENTIAL SERVICE SYSTEM  \nFOR PERSONS RECEIVING A DISABILITY WAIVER \n \n64.  As noted above, Minnesota’s Disability Waivers pay for residential services \nin a variety of settings, including CRS facilities. Defendants license CRS facilities \nthrough Minnesota Statute Chapter 245D. \n65.  As of July, 2016, there are approximately 3,457 actively licensed CRS \nfacilities, serving nearly 13,800 individual Disability Waiver recipients. \n66.  Defendants have known, since at least 2009, that individuals receiving \nDisability Waiver services need access to individualized housing as an alternative to CRS \nfacilities. In that year, the state legislature enacted a moratorium on the building of new \nCRS facilities. This moratorium has capped the total number of available CRS facility \nbeds statewide.  \n20 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 21 of 38\n \n67.  While Defendants currently approve some limited individualized \nalternatives for a small number of Disability Wavier recipients, they have failed to \nrecognize Plaintiffs’ individual choice and circumstances and have thus refused to ensure \nthe residential service system provides services in the most integrated setting. \nThe CRS Model \n68.  Before receiving Disability Waiver services, individuals must first go \nthrough an assessment process. If they qualify, the lead agency should offer the \nindividual Disability Waiver services as an alternative to services in an institution.  \n69.  Defendants require the lead agency to develop a support plan for the \nindividual that identifies his or her needs and the types of services necessary and \navailable to meet those needs. Defendants do not ensure, however, that individuals are \nreceiving services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. \n70.  Under the current system, Defendants approve the funding of Disability \nWaiver services in CRS facilities while failing to ensure that such a setting is the most \nintegrated setting appropriate for the individual. \n71.  If given a Disability Waiver, the individual is notified of available CRS \nfacilities where the Disability Waiver will pay for support services. Defendants, however, \ndo not provide information about more integrated alternatives to CRS facilities or \ninformation about how to access individualized housing services. \n72.  If no CRS openings are immediately available, the case manager may \ncontact CRS providers directly, speak with other case managers and lead agencies, or \n21 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 22 of 38\n \nsearch the CRS online database to determine when an open bed in a CRS facility may \nbecome available. \n73.  If an opening is located and the CRS operator is willing to accept the \nindividual, then he or she can move in. \n74.  Case managers rarely discuss integrated alternatives to CRS facilities. \nDefendants have failed to require case managers to inform individuals of such services or \nprovide individualized plans that could help Disability Waiver recipients choose, plan \nfor, and eventually move into individualized and integrated settings. \n75.  CRS facilities are inadequate for Plaintiffs because they do not enable them \nto access their communities and interact with nondisabled persons in the community to \nthe fullest extent possible as required by the integration mandates of the ADA and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n76.  Although many CRS residents, including Individual Plaintiffs, are told they \ncan go into the community, staffing patterns, CRS house rules, and other administrative \nrestrictions limit the scope and duration individuals can actually participate in everyday \ncommunity activities. \n77.  Many CRS residents have daily tasks done “for them,” even if they want to \nand are capable of doing tasks on their own. The lowered expectations and reduced skill-\nsets that CRS facilities engender pervade the public consciousness. This reinforces and \nperpetuates negative stereotypes about people with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities, mainly that they are unable and unfit to live in more integrated settings. \n22 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 23 of 38\n \n78.  Many CRS residents are frequently forced to spend their time secluded in \nCRS facilities, unable to participate in community life with their nondisabled peers. They \nhave little or no choice about whom to associate with, where or when to go into the \ncommunity, and how to structure their everyday schedule and lives. \n79.  This lack of interaction with the larger community can be harmful. For \nmany residents, an unchanging daily routine causes their social and independent living \nskills to atrophy, leading to an even lower likelihood that they will ever transition to \nliving and working in the community. It also leads to lower self-esteem and lowered \nexpectations of themselves, similar to the “learned helplessness” described in DAI v. \nPaterson, 653 F. Supp. 2d 184, 214 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (“When individuals are treated as if \nthey are helpless, the helplessness becomes a learned phenomenon.”) (internal quotations \nomitted). \nIntegrated Alternatives to CRS Facilities \n80.  Individualized housing services are both a process and a result. \nCollectively, the process of assisting a person to create an individualized residential \nservices plan and to obtain the services necessary to live in a more integrated setting \ncomplies with the concepts of a “community setting” as required by the CMS Settings \nrule and the most integrated setting as articulated in Olmstead v. L.C.  \n81.  Individuals who develop and live in individualized housing settings are \ngiven greater opportunities to interact and integrate themselves in the greater community, \nas they can, for example, have nondisabled roommates, set their own daily schedules and \n23 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 24 of 38\n \nsocial outings, hire and control their staffing and services, and develop networks of \nfriends without disabilities. \n82.  Individualized housing services help ensure individuals are living and \nworking in the most integrated setting. \n83.  Persons receiving individualized housing services experience greater \nopportunities to interact with neighbors, meet and develop relationships with persons \nwithout disabilities, and build or maintain basic living skills in a manner that often is not \npossible in CRS facilities. \n84.  Disability Waivers offer services that help individuals transition from less \nintegrated settings into homes of their own. These include, but are not limited to: \na.  The service of Consumer Training and Education and Family Training and \nCounseling, which allows individuals to hire trained person-centered \nplanners to help develop self-advocacy skills and create more \nindividualized service plans, including a personal housing transition plan \nthat will lay the foundation for a move into a more integrated setting; and \nb.  The service of Housing Access Coordination and Transitional Services \nwhich helps people with the logistics of moving. \n85.  Plaintiffs want access to these and other Disability Waiver services to help \nthem transition to more integrated settings, but Defendants fail to ensure individuals have \nnotice of, information regarding, or access to these services. Because these services are \nnever offered or provided, Plaintiffs have no means of appealing or otherwise challenging \nDHS’s actions. \n24 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 25 of 38\n \n86.  Defendants claim their Protocols require lead agencies to follow person-\ncentered practices when individuals with disabilities are moving from one setting to \nanother. Disability Waiver recipients, however, have no means of knowing about the \nProtocols or any mechanism to enforce them.   \n87.  Furthermore, Defendants’ Protocols only provide generalized and vague \nsuggestions regarding person-centered planning rather than requiring specific, \ncustomized, written, and enforceable personal housing transition plans necessary to help \nindividuals plan for, develop, and eventually move into integrated and individualized \nsettings. The Protocols also fail to ensure service recipients will be offered the \nopportunity to receive person-centered planning, transition, and individualized housing \nservices from trained providers. \n88.  DHS regulates all individualized housing services for individuals with \ndisabilities while primarily relying on individual counties and private service providers to \nprovide such services. Defendants have designed Protocols that fail to provide or require \npolicies, procedures, rules, or other regulations to direct counties to deliver individualized \nhousing services. \n89.  As a result of Defendants’ lack of individualized housing services \nmanagement, Plaintiffs are denied access to individualized housing services. \n90.  Because of Defendants’ lack of planning and oversight, there is a severe \nshortage of individualized housing providers in the state. \n91.  Defendants have failed to implement individualized housing services as \nalternatives to CRS, or to ensure that its current service planning system requires even the \n25 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 26 of 38\n \nconsideration of alternatives to CRS. Defendants has also failed to implement the \nintegrated residential goals of persons with disabilities, or to ensure there is a sufficient \ncapacity or planning for individualized housing services to allow persons with disabilities \nto find individualized housing and support to live in a setting more integrated than CRS \nfacilities. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n92.  Plaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure; the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nof the Constitution of the United States and the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) \nand 1396a(a)(3), as enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12101 and 12131 et seq. and implementing regulations; and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and implementing regulations.  \n93.  The Individual Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and other \nindividuals age 18 and older who are eligible for and have received a Disability Waiver, \nlive in a licensed CRS facility, and have not been given the choice and opportunity to \nreside in the most integrated residential setting appropriate to their needs. \n94.  The members in the Class are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable. \n95.  The Class is ascertainable, as all potential Class Members can be identified \nin Defendants’ current records of Medical Assistance and Disability Waiver recipients \nand CRS facility residents. \n96.  Plaintiffs estimate that there are at least 800 members of the Class. \n26 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 27 of 38\n \n97.  There are common issues of law relating to the Class that predominate, \nincluding, among other issues: \na.  Whether the Defendants are violating the Due Process Clause of the United \nStates Constitution and Plaintiffs’ Medicaid rights by failing to provide \nwritten notice of appeal rights when Individualized Housing services are \ndenied, including person-centered planning provided through the Disability \nWaivers and notice of appeal rights for such denial; \nb.  Whether the Defendants are violating the Plaintiffs’ Medicaid rights by \nfailing to provide timely access to person-centered planning; \nc.  Whether the Defendants are violating the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by \nplanning, administering, and operating a residential services system that: \ni.  Unnecessarily segregates Plaintiffs in CRS facilities and fails to \nprovide informed choice of more integrated alternatives; \nii.  Discriminates against the Plaintiffs by providing residential services \nto them in settings that are not the most integrated settings \nappropriate to their needs; and \niii.  Fails to provide the Plaintiffs with individualized housing services to \nallow them to transition to the most integrated settings appropriate to \ntheir needs. \n98.  There are common issues of fact relating to the Class that predominate, \nincluding, among other facts: \n27 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 28 of 38\n \na.  Whether the Plaintiffs are receiving notice of adverse action and \nopportunity to challenge the failure to provide individualized housing \nservices, including person-centered planning services; \nb.  Whether the Defendants have failed to provide person-centered planning \nservices to Plaintiffs with reasonable promptness; \nc.  Whether as a result of the Defendants’ actions and inactions in planning, \nadministering, and operating the residential service system for persons with \ndisabilities, Plaintiffs are provided services that enable them to live in the \nmost integrated residential setting appropriate to their needs; and \nd.  Whether the Defendants have a comprehensive and effective working plan \nfor providing integrated residential services to the Plaintiffs. \n99.  The Individual Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief individually \nand on behalf of the respective Class Members in order to access, utilize, and benefit \nfrom the Disability Waiver services for which they are eligible. The Individual Plaintiffs \nadequately and fairly represent the interest of all Class Members, will fully and \nvigorously prosecute this action, and are represented by attorneys experienced in class \naction litigation and disability law. \n100.  The Individual Plaintiffs’ injuries and claims are typical of those of the \nClass in that all the Class Members are unable to access and use individualized housing \nservices for the purpose of moving to the most integrated setting appropriate to their \nneeds. This harm to Class Members is a result of the Defendants’ failure to act properly \n28 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 29 of 38\n \nwith regard to planning, administering, and supporting their residential service system for \npersons with disabilities. \n101.  Individual Plaintiffs and Class Members have a common remedy: \nmodifications to Defendants’ residential service system to provide individuals with \nchoices and prevent needless segregation of individuals in segregated residential settings. \nCOUNT I \n (Asserted Against Commissioner Piper) \nFailure to Furnish Services with Reasonable Promptness in Violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) as Enforceable Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n102.  Plaintiffs re-allege the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth \nherein. \n103.  Minnesota voluntarily participates in the federal Medicaid program under \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., and as a condition of its participation in that program, must \nensure that services for eligible persons are provided in a reasonably prompt manner.  \n104.  The Medicaid program in Minnesota includes the provision of Disability \nWaiver services that Plaintiffs receive. \n105.  Federal law requires any state which has elected to participate in the \nMedicaid program under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., to provide all services to eligible \nindividuals with reasonable promptness. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); 42 C.F.R. § 435.930. \n106.  Defendant Piper has administered and continues to administer Disability \nWaiver services in a manner that denies Plaintiffs person-centered planning and other \nindividualized housing services offered through Disability Waivered services.  \n29 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 30 of 38\n \n107.  Specifically, Defendant Piper has failed to establish administrative \nprocedures that ensure individuals who are qualified for and requesting services to help \ntransition to a more integrated setting will actually receive those services. She has failed \nto direct counties and lead agencies to obtain, respond to, and act upon individual \nrequests to use Disability Waiver services in more integrated settings. Her actions and \ninactions have violated Plaintiffs’ rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) and its \nimplementing regulations and thus are enforceable as violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n108.  Defendant Piper’s acts and omissions violate the law and have caused and \ncontinue to cause Plaintiffs harm. Defendant Piper has denied Plaintiffs timely \nindividualized housing services without proper notice thereof, and they have thereby \nsustained injuries that include, but are not limited to, ongoing segregation from persons \nwithout disabilities. \n109.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys’ \nfees and costs resulting from the violation of Plaintiffs’ Medicaid rights, as enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nCOUNT II \n(Asserted Against Commissioner Piper) \nViolation of Due Process, Advance Notice, and Fair Hearing  \nas Enforceable Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n110.

Plaintiffs are Medicaid beneficiaries receiving a Disability Waiver who \nhave been denied access to individualized housing services, including person-centered \nplanning, due to Defendant Piper’s actions and inactions. \n112.  Defendant Piper has failed to provide Plaintiffs notice of adverse action and \nopportunity to challenge the failure to provide these individualized housing services.  \n113.  Defendant Piper has failed to require lead agencies to provide Plaintiffs \nnotice of adverse action and opportunity to challenge the failure to provide these \nindividualized housing services. \n114.  These failures have resulted in ongoing harm and Plaintiffs’ continued \ninability to receive individualized housing services.  \n115.  Defendant Piper’s conduct has caused Plaintiffs harm and has violated: \na.  Plaintiffs’ Due Process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the \nConstitution of the United States; and  \nb.  The advance notice and fair hearing requirements contained in the \nMedicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3), and its implementing regulations, \n42 C.F.R. §§ 431.200 to 431.250. \n116.  Defendant Piper’s conduct violates Plaintiffs’ rights and is redressable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n117.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and declaratory relief resulting \nfrom the violation of Plaintiffs’ Constitutional rights and injunctive relief, declaratory \nrelief, and attorneys’ fees and costs resulting from the violation of Medicaid rights, as \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n31 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 32 of 38\n \nCOUNT III \n(Asserted Against Commissioner Piper) \nViolation of Title II of  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act \n \n118.

Defendant Piper, acting in her official capacity, is responsible for the \noperation of DHS, which is a public entity within the meaning of the ADA. \n121.  Plaintiffs are qualified to receive Disability Waiver services, which are \npublic programs, services, and activities covered by Title II of the ADA. Plaintiffs are \ncapable of and want to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and \nDefendant Piper can reasonably accommodate their requests. \n122.  Defendant Piper is violating Title II of the ADA and its implementing \nregulations by failing to offer and provide services to Plaintiffs in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs.  \n123.  Defendant Piper is violating Title II of the ADA and its implementing \nregulations by unnecessarily segregating the Plaintiffs in CRS facilities that are not the \nmost integrated settings available to meet their needs. \n32 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 33   Filed 02/23/17   Page 33 of 38\n \n124.

No. 16-2623 (DWF/BRT) \nRichard Murphy; Marrie Bottelson; and   \nDionne Swanson; and on behalf of others \nsimilarly situated,   \n \nORDER ON PLAINTIFFS’  \n  Plaintiffs, \nMOTION TO COMPEL REGARDING \nv.  PLAINTIFFS’ THIRD SET OF \nREQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS  \nEmily Johnson Piper, in her capacity as \nCommissioner of the Minnesota \nDepartment of Human Services, \n      Defendant. \n \nJoseph W. Anthony, Esq., Peter McElligott, Esq., and Steven M. Pincus, Esq., Anthony \nOstlund Baer & Louwagie PA; and Justin H. Perl, Esq., Sean B. Burke, Esq., and \nChristen Leigh Chapman, Esq., Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, counsel for Plaintiffs. \n \nJanine Wetzel Kimble, Esq., and Scott H. Ikeda, Esq., Minnesota Attorney General’s \nOffice, counsel for Defendant. \n \n \nThis matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Discovery \nRegarding Plaintiffs’ Third Set of Requests for Documents (Doc. No. 119). The Court \nheld a hearing on the motion on November 16, 2017, at which the parties were \nrepresented by counsel.  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 governs discovery in federal court. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 26(b)(1). Discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, however, is not \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 148   Filed 11/20/17   Page 2 of 9\nwithout bounds even if relevance is shown. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2)(C) \nprovides: \nOn motion or on its own, the court must limit the frequency or extent of \ndiscovery otherwise allowed by these rules or by local rule if it determines \nthat:  \n \n(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can \nbe obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less \nburdensome, or less expensive; \n \n(ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the \ninformation by discovery in the action; or \n \n(iii) the proposed discovery is outside the scope permitted by Rule 26(b)(1).  \n \nRule 26(b)(1) provides that “[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged \nmatter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the \ncase, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in \ncontroversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the \nimportance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of \nthe proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  \nThe Court has reviewed each discovery request at issue and considered both the \nrelevance and proportionality of the discovery sought. Based on the Court’s \nconsideration, and the file, submissions, and proceedings herein, the Court makes the \nfollowing ruling.  \nORDER \n  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Discovery Regarding Plaintiffs’ Third Set of  \n2 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 148   Filed 11/20/17   Page 3 of 9\nRequests for Documents (Doc. No. 119) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN \nPART. Plaintiffs seek to compel the production of documents responsive to Request \nNos. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. As to all of those requests, Plaintiffs seek \nresponsive documents maintained by the Department of Human Services (“DHS”). As to \nRequest Nos. 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, and 25,1 Plaintiffs seek responsive documents also \nmaintained by “lead agencies,”2 arguing that those documents would be within DHS’s \n                                                           \n1   Initially, Plaintiffs’ identified only Request Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 22. At the hearing, \nhowever, they modified their position to include Request Nos. 24 and 25.  \n \n2   According to Plaintiffs’ definitions, lead agency means a Minnesota county or \ntribe as identified in Minn. Stat. § 256B.04(1) and (2). Section 256B.04 specifically \nstates: \nSubdivision 1. General. The state agency shall supervise the administration \nof medical assistance for eligible recipients by the county agencies \nhereunder.  \n. . . .  \nSubd. 2. Rulemaking authority. Make uniform rules, not inconsistent with \nlaw, for carrying out and enforcing the provisions hereof in an efficient, \neconomical, and impartial manner, and to the end that the medical \nassistance system may be administered uniformly throughout the state, \nhaving regard for varying costs of medical care in different parts of the state \nand the conditions in each case, and in all things to carry out the spirit and \npurpose of this program, which rules shall be furnished immediately to all \ncounty agencies, and shall be binding on such county agencies. \nMinn. Stat. § 256B.04(1) and (2). As Defendant correctly points out, this Court’s \nprevious order addressed the Defendant’s ability to “make a full, fair, and specific answer \nto an interrogatory” based on information within Defendant’s “knowledge and control,” \nnot the Defendant’s obligations to search for and retrieve third-party documents subject \nto a Rule 34 request for production. (Doc. No. 78, 8/21/17 Order at 13, 15.)  \n3 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 148   Filed 11/20/17   Page 4 of 9\ncontrol. Defendant argues that the lead agencies’ documents are not in Defendant’s \npossession, custody, or control.3 \na.  Documents Maintained by Defendant Responsive to Document Request \nNos. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 \n \nAs currently drafted—and without consideration of further limitation or \nnarrowing, or the application of the search terms allowed—the discovery requests at issue \n(Request Nos. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25) are overbroad and unduly burdensome. \nAlthough the requests seek documents about subjects that are relevant, the scope of the \nrequests are simply too broad and not proportional to the needs of the case. However, \napplication of the search terms (see Doc. No. 102, Order on Search Terms) sufficiently \nreduces both the breadth and burden of responding to Request Nos. 18, 19, 20, 22, and \n24, at least to the extent that the documents are maintained by Defendant.4 Accordingly, \nas to documents in the custody and possession of Defendant, the motion to compel is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Documents responsive to Request Nos. \n18, 19, 20, 22, and 24, identified (using the previously ordered search terms) must be \n                                                           \n3   The Court noted in its prior Order that “Defendant’s objections to document \nrequests do not satisfy Rule 34.” (Doc. No. 78, 8/21/17 Order (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. \n34(b)(2)(C) (“An objection must state whether any responsive materials are being \nwithheld on the basis of that objection. An objection to part of a request must specify the \npart and permit inspection of the rest.”).) Defendant’s responses to Plaintiffs’ third set of \ndocument requests are similarly deficient. Defendant is hereby on notice that failure to \nadhere to Rule 34’s specificity requirements in future responses may result in a finding of \nwaiver of the objections to the discovery requests. See Fischer v. Forrest, No. 14 Civ. \n1304 (PAE) (AJP), 2017 WL 128705, at *4–6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2017). \n \n4   Without the application of the previously ordered search terms these requests are \noverbroad and unduly burdensome and would be denied.  \n4 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 148   Filed 11/20/17   Page 5 of 9\nproduced. The Court will not revisit the decision on search terms for document requests \nthat were served prior to this Court’s decision on search terms for pending document \nrequests.5 Plaintiffs’ request to add new search terms for these requests is denied. First, \nPlaintiffs had every opportunity to include any search terms they believed were \napplicable to these requests prior to this Court’s order on search terms (or at the very least \nalert the Court and Defendant that these requests would require different search terms).6 \nSecond, the ordered search terms are adequate to identify relevant and proportional \ndiscovery for these requests. As to temporal scope, January 1, 2009 applies, except as to \nRequest No. 24, which seeks documents on or after July 13, 2017.  \nPlaintiffs’ motion to compel responses to Request No. 21 is DENIED as overly \nbroad and unduly burdensome. Request No. 21 appears to be drafted in response to the \nCourt’s order regarding Req. No. 1. The only difference between the two requests is the \n                                                           \n5   The parties were required to discuss a plan and protocol for any electronic \ndiscovery before November 28, 2016. (Doc. No. 25, Pretrial Scheduling Order 2.) \nRegrettably, whatever protocol the parties have in place is not working. Re-litigating \nsearch terms with every wave of discovery is not consistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. \nTherefore, the parties are hereby required to meet and confer and file a complete and \nworkable plan and protocol for any additional written discovery as set forth in this \nCourt’s Third Amended Scheduling Order.  \n \n6   On September 13, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their supplemental memorandum in \nsupport of their proposed search terms. (Doc. No. 80.) In their memorandum, Plaintiffs \nrepresented that “[t]he parties agree[d] that in order for Defendant to reasonably respond \nto Plaintiffs’ document requests, the Defendant should search the relevant Minnesota \nDepartment of Human Services (DHS) databases with specific search terms related to the \ndocuments requests.” (Doc. No. 80 at 1.) By the time of this September 13, 2017 filing, \nPlaintiffs had served their Third Set of Document Requests, including the requests at \nissue. On October 4, 2017, this Court issued an Order adopting Plaintiffs’ proposed \nterms. (Doc. No. 102.)  \n5 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 148   Filed 11/20/17   Page 6 of 9\ntemporal scope given. The new request seeks documents from January 1, 2009 to \nDecember 31, 2012. The Court, however, had already imposed a January 1, 2013 date for \nReq. No. 1. (Doc. No. 78, at 12.) \nPlaintiffs’ motion to compel responses to Request No. 23 is also DENIED as \noverly broad and unduly burdensome (i.e., “. . . Produce all documents Defendant \nreviewed or had the opportunity to review in these case files . . .”). To the extent \nPlaintiffs seek information about DHS’s lead agency reviews along these lines, it may be \nmore efficiently obtained through depositions. If documents are sought, a more narrowly \ntailored request must be made. \nPlaintiffs’ motion to compel responses to Request No. 25 is also DENIED as \noverly broad and unduly burdensome. Neither the application of the previously ordered \nsearch terms, nor the newly proposed search terms, cures the overbreadth or burden that \nresults from this request.

Moreover, this Court cannot find, based upon the record, that the \napplication of the ordered search terms would address the problem of overbreadth and \nburden as to the collection and review of lead agency documents.8 If Plaintiffs intend to \ndiscover documents from the lead agency files through written document requests to \nDefendant: (1) the document requests must be more narrowly tailored; and (2) Plaintiffs \nmust offer more support to establish that the documents requested are in Defendant’s \ncontrol. \n Accordingly, before new document requests are served, Plaintiffs must take a \nRule 30(b)(6) deposition of DHS for the purpose of obtaining DHS’s knowledge \nregarding documents and records (1) kept by DHS, or (2) kept by the lead agencies that \nrelate to DHS’s management and oversight responsibility over the statewide disability \nwaiver system and DHS’s “control” over such documents and records.9 The 30(b)(6) \ntopics must be particularized to address this objective and DHS must prepare its 30(b)(6) \ndesignee(s) “to the extent matters are reasonably available, whether from documents, past \n                                                           \n8   Defendant has provided evidence that some of the lead agencies’ documents are in \npaper form and thus would not be identified through search terms. (Doc. No. 127, Decl. \nof Jean Martin ¶ 5.) \n \n9   The Court will not detail how these topics might be drafted, but reminds the \nparties that particularity is required so that DHS may prepare its designated witness(es). \nTo the extent Plaintiffs are planning to show that DHS has control over documents \nresponsive to future document requests, Plaintiffs should seek evidence of control \nconsistent with Rule 34 jurisprudence. Further, nothing in this Order precludes Plaintiffs \nfrom including topics related to specific documents that DHS has within its possession, \ncustody, and control (i.e., specific documents pertaining to the Multi-County \nWorkgroup). Indeed, given Plaintiffs’ representation at the hearing that they were \nworking in the dark, topics directed to DHS’s record-keeping and document retention \nmay help tailor discovery going forward.  \n7 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 148   Filed 11/20/17   Page 8 of 9\nemployees, or other sources.” Great Am.

The document deposition does not \npreclude Plaintiffs from taking the 30(b)(6) deposition of DHS, which is the subject of \nthis Court’s Order, dated October 30, 2017 (Doc. No. 116).10 Nor does it preclude a \ndeposition of the individual(s) designated for the document deposition in their individual \ncapacity at a later date.  \nAfter the conclusion of these depositions, Plaintiffs will be in a better position to \nframe more targeted document requests and to support their position that Defendant has \ncontrol of responsive documents that are in the lead agencies’ custody or possession. \nTherefore, nothing in this Order precludes Plaintiffs from serving more targeted \ndocument requests after they have followed the above directives.11 An amended \nscheduling order will issue separately to include relevant modifications and extensions. \nThe parties should carefully review the Third Amended Scheduling Order.  \n                                                           \n10   Defendant’s appeal of this Order is pending.

No. 10.)  For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part \nthe motion. \n\nBACKGROUND \nThis case relates to an alleged denial of services under Minnesota’s Medicaid \nDisability Waivers and the resulting isolation and segregation of individuals with \ndisabilities who seek greater integration into their communities.  This case has been \ndesignated as related to Jensen v. Minnesota Department of Human Services, Civ. \nNo. 09-1775 (D. Minn.).  (Doc. No. 6.)  Mikkelson v. Johnson Piper, Civ. No. 15-3439 \n(D. Minn.) (formerly Guggenberger v. Minnesota), is also related to the Jensen case.  \n(See Order, Mikkelson v. Johnson Piper, Civ. No. 15-3439 (D. Minn. Aug. 31, 2015), \nDoc. No. 4.)  Many of the allegations, claims, and legal issues presented in this case are \nsimilar to those previously considered by the Court in its July 28, 2016 Order in \nMikkelson.  See Guggenberger v. Minnesota, 198 F. Supp. 3d 973 (D. Minn. 2016).  The \nCourt will analyze the allegations and arguments specific to this case below, but also \ndirects readers to Guggenberger for additional background on the relevant law \nunderlying Plaintiffs’ claims. \nI.  Minnesota’s Residential Service System Under Medicaid Disability Waivers \nMinnesota participates in the federal Medicaid program, a jointly-operated federal \nand state program that provides “healthcare and related services” to individuals with \ndisabilities.  (Doc. No. 33 (“Am. Compl.”) ¶ 32.)1  In particular, Minnesota offers \n                                                           \n1   Plaintiffs’ original Complaint was filed on August 3, 2016.  (Doc. No. 1.)  On \nSeptember 14, 2016, Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss presently pending before the \nCourt.  (Doc. No. 10.)  On January 20, 2017, the Court held a hearing on Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss.  (Doc. No. 29.)  On February 17, 2017, the parties filed a Stipulation \npermitting Plaintiffs to file an Amended Complaint.  (See Doc. No. 31.)  Pursuant to \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page) \n2 \n \n\nMedicaid services to individuals with disabilities in the form of Medicaid Home and \nCommunity Based Disability Waivers (“Disability Waivers”).2  (Id. at 2, ¶¶ 21, 25.)  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, states who participate in Medicaid must do so in accordance with \nfederal law.  (Id. ¶ 32.)   \nPlaintiffs allege that Disability Waivers in Minnesota “provide a comprehensive, \ncost-effective, home and community-based package of services,” including “direct care \nstaffing, vocational skills and employment assistance, environmental modifications and \nother assistive technology, transitional and housing assistance, and other services \ndesigned to help people with disabilities live in his or her own home and interact with the \nlarger nondisabled community.”  (Id. ¶¶ 33-34.)  Plaintiffs assert that “[t]he Disability \nWaivers can fund a variety of residential services, including individualized housing \nservices.”  (Id. ¶ 25.)  According to Plaintiffs, before individuals receive Disability \nWaiver services, they must be assessed and deemed qualified in order to be offered \n“Disability Waiver services as an alternative to services in an institution.”  (Id. ¶ 68.) \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(Footnote Continued From Previous Page) \nMagistrate Judge Becky R. Thorson’s February 22, 2017 Order Granting Plaintiffs Leave \nto File Amended Complaint, “Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint (Doc. \nNo. 10) . . . serves as Defendants’ response to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint.”  \n(Doc. No. 32.)  On February 23, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint.  (Doc. \nNo. 33 (“Am. Compl.”).) \n \n2   In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to four separate waiver programs \ncollectively as “Disability Waivers.”  (Id. ¶ 24.)  These programs include the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Waiver, the Community Access for Disability Inclusion \nWaiver, the Community Alternative Care Waiver, and the Brain Injury Waiver.  (Id.)   \n3 \n \n\nPlaintiffs allege that Disability Waivers may be used to fund residential services in \na number of different settings.  (Id. ¶ 64.)  One possible setting is a Community \nResidential Setting (“CRS”) facility. (Id. at 2, ¶ 64.)  Plaintiffs explain that “CRS \nfacilities contain up to five persons, all with disabilities, living in a residence that is \nowned, leased, operated, and/or controlled by the same organization that provides the \nservices.”  (Id. ¶ 6.)  Defendants oversee the licensure of CRS facilities pursuant to \nMinnesota Statute Chapter 245D.  (Id. ¶ 64.)  According to Plaintiffs, as of July 2016, \nnearly 13,800 Disability Waiver recipients in Minnesota resided in approximately 3,457 \nlicensed CRS facilities.  (Id. ¶ 65.)   \nPlaintiffs allege that an alternative model involving individualized housing \nservices exists under the Disability Waivers that would permit individuals to achieve \ngreater integration in the community.  (Id. ¶ 7; see also id. ¶¶ 80-83.)  According to \nPlaintiffs, “individualized housing uses Disability Waiver services, including \nperson-centered planning, to design and implement a customized setting for the \nindividual to live, work, and enjoy leisure time in the most integrated setting.”  (Id. ¶ 7.)  \nPlaintiffs identify examples of services offered under Disability Waivers “that help \nindividuals transition from less integrated settings into homes of their own.”  (Id. ¶ 84.)  \nFor example, Plaintiffs identify Consumer Training and Education and Family Training \nand Counseling “which allows individuals to hire trained person-centered planners to \nhelp develop self-advocacy skills and create more individualized service plans, including \na personal housing transition plan that will lay the foundation for a move into a more \n4 \n \n\nintegrated setting.”  (Id. ¶ 84(a).)  Plaintiffs also identify Housing Access Coordination \nand Transitional Services to assist with moving logistics.  (Id. ¶ 84(b).) \nPlaintiffs allege that DHS is the Minnesota state agency responsible for overseeing \nthe state’s provision of Medicaid, including “Disability Waivers and residential services \nfor persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities, traumatic brain injury, \nmental illness, and other disabilities.”  (Id. ¶ 21.)  Plaintiffs further allege that \nCommissioner Johnson Piper administers and manages the Disability Waivers along with \noverseeing residential service providers such as those who operate CRS facilities.  (Id. \n¶ 23.)   \nPlaintiffs assert that “Defendants direct and manage counties,” otherwise known \nas “lead agencies,” to administer Disability Waiver services throughout the state.  (Id. \n¶ 27.)  Lead agencies are involved in the initial assessment for Disability Waiver services \nand are required by Defendants “to develop a support plan for the individual that \nidentifies his or her needs and the types of services necessary and available to meet those \nneeds.”  (Id. ¶¶ 68-69.)  According to Plaintiffs, “DHS regulates all individualized \nhousing services for individuals with disabilities while primarily relying on individual \ncounties and private service providers to provide such services.”  (Id. ¶ 88.)  Plaintiffs \nassert that Defendants permit counties to exercise discretion over “whether to offer \nindividualized housing services.”  (Id. ¶ 27.)  According to Plaintiffs, most counties do \nnot offer such services.  (Id.) \n5 \n \n\nII.  The Named Plaintiffs  \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint is brought by three named Plaintiffs representing a \nputative class including “individuals who are receiving a [Disability Waiver] and are \nliving in a [CRS] facility, but want to live elsewhere and be integrated into their \ncommunity.”  (Id. at 2.)  Each named Plaintiff is an individual with one or more physical, \ndevelopmental, or cognitive disabilities who receives a Disability Waiver.  (Id. ¶¶ 1, 2, \n29, 30, 31.)   \nPlaintiff Tenner Murphy (“Murphy”) alleges he is “stuck in the CRS facility \nbecause of Defendants’ failure to provide an informed choice of integrated alternatives.”  \n(Id. ¶ 29(m).)  Murphy asserts that his living environment is a segregated setting and that \nhe primarily interacts with other individuals with disabilities and staff.  (Id. ¶ 29(k).)  \nMurphy alleges he typically “spends most of his time alone, even though he would prefer \nto interact with other people.”  (Id. ¶ 29(g).)  He asserts he is not able to control staff \nhiring or training and cannot decide who he will live with.  (Id. ¶ 29(i).)  He would prefer \nto select his own roommates.  (Id. ¶ 29(j).)  Murphy’s guardian “has asked several people \nat the lead agency about accessing more individualized housing options.”  (Id. ¶ 29(k).)  \nHowever, Murphy asserts that Defendants “have prevented [him] from choosing \nindividualized housing services, such as a live-in caregiver that he can hire and train to \nhelp him more fully interact with his community and be as integrated as possible.”  (Id. \n¶ 29(m).)   \nPlaintiff Marrie Bottelson (“Bottelson”) “has lived in a CRS facility for about \nthirteen years” and “would like to hire her own staff and live in her own apartment.”  (Id. \n6 \n \n\n¶¶ 30(c), 30(g).)  Bottelson contends that her ability to spend time in the community is \n“severely limited” due to staffing in her current residential setting.  (Id. ¶¶ 30(e), 30(f).)  \nSpecifically, Bottelson “does not get out into the community nearly as much as she would \nif she were able to create her own schedule.”  (Id.)  According to Bottelson, “[f]or the \npast several years, she has asked . . . different case managers . . . to help her move into \nher own apartment.”  (Id. ¶ 30(d).)  Bottelson alleges she has requested such help from \nher case managers to access individualized housing options since as early as 2013.  (Id. \n¶¶ 30(i), 30(j).)  She has been told by case managers “that individualized housing is not a \npossibility for her,” “that such housing was too hard to find,” and “that there are no other \noptions for her.”  (Id. ¶¶ 30(d), 30(i), 30(j).)  Bottelson alleges she “needs \nperson-centered planning to help her develop an individualized moving plan and other \nindividualized housing services” to achieve her goals relating to her preferred living \narrangement.  (Id. ¶ 30(h).)  She asserts that she met with a person-centered planner in \nJuly 2016 but “has not received all the necessary individualized housing services to help \nher find or develop alternatives to her current CRS facility.”  (Id. ¶ 30(k).) \nBottelson’s current roommate and best friend, Plaintiff Dionne Swanson \n(“Swanson”), also alleges a need for “person-centered planning services, and other \nindividualized housing services to help her create and execute a plan to live in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to her needs.”  (Id. ¶¶ 30(h), 31, 31(e).)  She has asked for \nsuch services “for a long time,” but “has not received them.”  (Id. ¶ 31(f).)  Swanson \nalleges she has been told by case managers that “she is not ‘independent enough’ for \nindividualized housing,” even though Defendants have no such criteria.  (Id. ¶ 31(b).)   \n7 \n \n\nAs noted above, Plaintiffs assert that they want access to services offered under \nthe Disability Waivers “to help them transition to more integrated settings.”  (Id. ¶ 85.)  \nDespite not receiving the requested individualized housing services described above, \neach Plaintiff alleges he or she “has not received a notice of denial or information \nregarding [their] due process rights in regards to [their] request for these services.”  (Id. \n¶ 29(n); see also id. ¶¶ 30(l), 31(f).) \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Claims \nNotwithstanding the alleged availability of individualized housing services that \nwould permit greater integration into the community, Plaintiffs state that “Defendants \nhave failed to inform all persons receiving a Disability Waiver of individualized housing \nservice options and have failed to explain how to access such services.”  (Id. ¶ 28.)  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs assert that “Defendants have . . . failed to provide transition planning \nand support for such services.”  (Id.)  Finally, Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants have \nfurther failed to provide notices of denial or information regarding due process rights in \nregards to requests for these services.”  (Id.)  These collective failures form the basis of \nPlaintiffs’ claims, outlined below. \nPlaintiffs assert that Defendants disproportionately rely on CRS facilities through \ntheir management of Disability Waiver services, leading Plaintiffs to reside in segregated \nsettings.  (Id. ¶ 4; see also id. ¶ 26.)  According to Plaintiffs, “Defendants’ administration, \noperation, and oversight (or lack thereof) has led to a pervasive overreliance on \nsegregated CRS facilities.”  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Plaintiffs allege that many CRS facilities are \nsegregated settings according to DHS’s own definition.  (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.)  Under this \n8 \n \n\ndefinition, a segregated setting is one “populated exclusively or primarily with \nindividuals with disabilities . . . [and] characterized by regimentation in daily activities \n[and] limits on individuals’ ability to engage freely in community activities.”  (Id. ¶ 5 \n(quoting Minnesota Olmstead Plan: Demographic Analysis, Segregated Settings Counts, \nTargets and Timelines, September 20, 2014, p. 8).)  Plaintiffs assert that many CRS \nfacilities sanctioned by Defendants meet this definition because they limit individual \nchoices regarding free time, daily schedules, interaction with individuals outside of the \nfacility, and who to live with.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  According to Plaintiffs, “staffing patterns, CRS \nhouse rules, and other administrative restrictions limit the scope and duration individuals \ncan actually participate in everyday community activities.”  (Id. ¶ 76.)  In addition, \nPlaintiffs allege, “[m]any CRS residents are frequently forced to spend their time \nsecluded in CRS facilities,” separated from their communities.  (Id. ¶ 78.)  Plaintiffs \nallege that “[t]his lack of interaction with the larger community can be harmful.”  (Id. \n¶ 79.)  In particular, Plaintiffs allege that “[f]or many residents, an unchanging daily \nroutine causes their social and independent living skills to atrophy, leading to an even \nlower likelihood that they will ever transition to living and working in the community.”  \n(Id.)  According to Plaintiffs, these circumstances “also lead[] to lower self-esteem and \nlowered expectations of themselves.”  (Id.) \nIn contrast with these settings, Plaintiffs allege that “[i]ndividuals who develop \nand live in individualized housing settings are given greater opportunities to interact and \nintegrate themselves in the greater community” based on increased flexibility in \nschedules, roommate choices, staff hiring, and social opportunities with non-disabled \n9 \n \n\nindividuals.  (Id. ¶ 81.)  In particular, Plaintiffs assert that “[p]ersons receiving \nindividualized housing services experience greater opportunities to interact with \nneighbors, meet and develop relationships with persons without disabilities, and build or \nmaintain basic living skills in a manner that often is not possible in CRS facilities.”  (Id. \n¶ 83.)   \nAccording to Plaintiffs, “Defendants have created, maintained, and over-relied on \na residential service system that limits individual autonomy, choice, and integration” in \nviolation of the integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).  \n(Id. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have failed “to reasonably modify its \nresidential service system” in a manner that would permit Plaintiffs to live in the most \nintegrated setting.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  According to Plaintiffs, “Defendants currently approve \nsome limited individualized alternatives for a small number of Disability Waiver \nrecipients.”  (Id. ¶ 67.)  However, Plaintiffs assert, “they have failed to recognize \nPlaintiffs’ individual choice and circumstances and have thus refused to ensure the \nresidential service system provides services in the most integrated setting.”  (Id.)  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs assert that “Defendants provide impermissible discretion to each lead \nagency” instead of “requir[ing] statewide access to individualized housing services.”  (Id. \n¶ 27.)  Plaintiffs also assert that Defendants “have failed to directly inform persons in \nCRS facilities about person-centered planning services and other individualized housing \nservices that would allow them to move to a more integrated setting.”  (Id. ¶ 57.)  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, they “are capable of and want to live in the most integrated \n10 \n \n\nsetting appropriate to their needs and Defendant Piper can reasonably accommodate their \nrequests.”  (Id. ¶ 121.) \nIn 2009, Plaintiffs allege, the number of CRS facility beds available statewide was \ncapped by a legislative moratorium on the development of any new CRS facilities.  (Id. \n¶ 66.)  Thus, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have been aware since as early as 2009 \n“that individuals receiving Disability Waiver services need access to individualized \nhousing as an alternative to CRS facilities.”  (Id.)  Plaintiffs assert that Disability Waiver \nrecipients receive information about available CRS facilities and case managers may take \nsteps to locate CRS facility openings if none are available.  (Id. ¶¶ 71-73.)  However, \nPlaintiffs allege, “[c]ase managers rarely discuss integrated alternatives to CRS \nfacilities.”  (Id. ¶ 74.)  Further, Defendants purportedly fail to inform Disability Waiver \nrecipients “about more integrated alternatives to CRS facilities or information about how \nto access individualized housing services” or require case managers to provide this \ninformation.  (Id. ¶¶ 71, 74.)  Plaintiffs also contend that “Defendants approve the \nfunding of Disability Waiver services in CRS facilities while failing to ensure that such a \nsetting is the most integrated setting appropriate for the individual.”  (Id. ¶ 70.)   \nPlaintiffs allege that they are entitled to use Disability Waiver services to hire a \nperson-centered planner “in order to develop a comprehensive individualized transition \nplan to move to more integrated housing.”  (Id. ¶ 10; see also ¶ 106.)  According to \nPlaintiffs, Commissioner Johnson Piper “has failed to establish administrative procedures \nthat ensure individuals who are qualified for and requesting services to help transition to \na more integrated setting will actually receive those services.”  (Id. ¶ 107.)  In particular, \n11 \n \n\nPlaintiffs assert, Commissioner Johnson Piper has not required counties “to obtain, \nrespond to, and act upon individual requests to use Disability Waiver services in more \nintegrated settings.”  (Id.)  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants “have denied [them] the \nopportunity to find trained person-centered planners, to receive services from a \nperson-centered planner in a timely fashion, or to receive any such services in order to \ndevelop and implement comprehensive individualized transition plans.”  (Id. ¶ 11.)  \nPlaintiffs assert that “Defendants fail to ensure individuals have notice of, information \nregarding, or access to” services available under the Disability Waivers to facilitate a \ntransition to a more integrated setting.  (Id. ¶¶ 84-85.)  Plaintiffs also allege that \nCommissioner Johnson Piper has not provided or required lead agencies to provide \n“notice of adverse action and opportunity to challenge the failure to provide . . . \nindividualized housing services.”  (Id. ¶ 112.)  According to Plaintiffs, “[b]ecause these \nservices are never offered or provided, Plaintiffs have no means of appealing or otherwise \nchallenging DHS’s actions.”  (Id. ¶ 85.) \nPlaintiffs describe measures undertaken by Defendants in the areas of \nperson-centered planning and integrated residential settings under Minnesota’s Olmstead \nPlan and Defendants’ Person-Centered, Informed Choice and Transition Protocols \n(“Protocols”).  (See id. ¶¶ 53-62.)  However, Plaintiffs assert that “[n]othing in the \nProtocols, the Olmstead Plan, or the [Olmstead] Work Plans indicates how DHS will \nreduce its overreliance on CRS facilities by providing appropriate services to people \nentitled to more integrated alternatives than CRS facilities.”  (Id. ¶ 61; see also id. ¶ 53.)  \nIn particular, Plaintiffs contend that the Protocols “only provide generalized suggestions, \n12 \n \n\nrather than enforceable requirements,” so they are insufficient to ensure Plaintiffs have \naccess to the individualized housing services they seek.  (Id. ¶¶ 58-59; see also id. ¶ 88.)  \nPlaintiffs also state that prior versions of the Olmstead Plan identified “specific \nindividualized housing services” referred to as Individualized Housing Options, but assert \nthat the current Olmstead Plan contains no such information.  (Id. ¶ 60.)   \nPlaintiffs further allege that “Defendants have promised . . . to move 5,547 people \ninto more integrated settings” in the Olmstead Plan, but fail to specify “how or when this \nwill happen, where these persons will come from (including whether or not they will \ncome from CRS settings), or how and if they will be informed of the purported options.”  \n(Id. ¶ 62.)  In short, Plaintiffs assert that “Defendants lack a working plan with accurate \ndata, details, and measurable goals to . . . fix its residential service system that over-relies \non CRS facilities to the detriment of integrated alternatives such as individualized \nhousing services . . . and . . . [e]nsure [Plaintiffs] are receiving services in the most \nintegrated settings.”  (Id. ¶ 63.) \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants’ lack of management, planning, and oversight \nrelating to individualized housing services has denied Plaintiffs access to such services \nand has resulted in “a severe shortage of individualized housing providers in the state.”  \n(Id. ¶¶ 89-90.)  According to Plaintiffs, “Defendants have failed to implement \nindividualized housing services as alternatives to CRS, or to ensure that its current \nservice planning system requires even the consideration of alternatives to CRS.”  (Id. \n¶ 91.)  Relatedly, Plaintiffs assert, Defendants have not “ensure[d] there is a sufficient \ncapacity or planning for individualized housing services to allow persons with disabilities \n13 \n \n\nto find individualized housing and support to live in a setting more integrated than CRS \nfacilities.”  (Id.) \nPlaintiffs assert the following claims against Commissioner Johnson Piper:  \n(1) failure to furnish Medicaid services with reasonable promptness under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(8), enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count I); (2) violation of Plaintiffs’ Due \nProcess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act’s advance notice \nand fair hearing requirements, enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count II); and \n(3) violation of Title II of the ADA (Count III).  (Id. ¶¶ 102-25.)  Plaintiffs assert the \nfollowing claim against all Defendants:  violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n(“RA”) (Count IV).  (Id. ¶¶ 126-32.) \nPlaintiffs assert their claims on behalf of themselves and a putative Class of \nsimilarly situated individuals.  (See id. ¶¶ 92-101.)  Plaintiffs assert that they and the \nClass “have a common remedy:  modifications to Defendants’ residential service system \nto provide individuals with choices and prevent needless segregation of individuals in \nsegregated residential settings.”  (Id. ¶ 101.)  Plaintiffs seek “an informed choice and \nrealistic opportunity to receive residential services in the most integrated setting.”  (Id. \n¶ 4.)  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy Defendants’ alleged \nviolations of the law, attorney fees and costs, and other relief deemed necessary to protect \nthe rights of Plaintiffs and the Class.  (See id. at Prayer for Relief ¶¶ 2-6.) \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that:  (1) Commissioner \nJohnson Piper is violating the Medicaid Act by not providing services with reasonable \npromptness and violating Plaintiffs’ Constitutional and Medicaid due process rights; and \n14 \n \n\n(2) Commissioner Johnson Piper is violating the ADA and Defendants are violating the \nRA by segregating Plaintiffs “while failing to provide them with individualized housing \nservices for which they are eligible.”  (Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶¶ 2-3.)   \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring Defendants to:  (1) “[p]romptly ensure \nevery Disability Waiver recipient living in a CRS facility receives notice about eligibility \nfor and access to individualized housing services, including person-centered planning;” \n(2) “[s]pecifically provide access and take prompt steps to make individualized housing \nservices, including person-centered planning, available to Plaintiffs in a reasonable \namount of time . . .”; and (3) “[t]ake such other steps as necessary to enable Plaintiffs to \nreceive residential services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs . . . .”  \n(Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4.)  Under items (2) and (3), above, Plaintiffs identify in detail \nthe proposed relief they seek to modify the state’s residential service system.  (Id. at \nPrayer for Relief ¶¶ 4(b)-4(c).)  Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims under \nRules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (See Doc. No. 10.)   \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Legal Standard \nA motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) challenges the \nCourt’s subject matter jurisdiction.  To survive a motion to dismiss for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, the party asserting jurisdiction has the burden of proving jurisdiction.  \nV S Ltd. P’ship v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 235 F.3d 1109, 1112 (8th Cir. 2000) \n(citation omitted).  “Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold requirement which must be \n15 \n \n\nassured in every federal case.”  Kronholm v. F.D.I.C., 915 F.2d 1171, 1174 (8th \nCir. 1990).  \nA motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may challenge a \nplaintiff’s complaint either on its face or on the factual truthfulness of its averments. \nOsborn v. United States, 918 F.2d 724, 729 n.6 (8th Cir. 1990) (citations omitted).  When \na defendant brings a facial challenge—a challenge that, even if truthful, the facts alleged \nin a claim are insufficient to establish jurisdiction—a court reviews the pleadings alone, \nand the non-moving party receives the same protections as it would defending against a \nmotion brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Id. (citation omitted).  In a factual challenge \nto jurisdiction, the court may consider matters outside the pleadings, and the non-moving \nparty does not benefit from the safeguards of Rule 12(b)(6).  Id. at 728-30 n.4 (citations \nomitted) (holding that on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenging subject-matter jurisdiction, \nthe court “has authority to consider matters outside the pleadings”).   \nIn deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court assumes all \nfacts in the complaint to be true and construes all reasonable inferences from those facts \nin the light most favorable to the complainant.  Morton v. Becker, 793 F.2d 185, 187 (8th \nCir. 1986).  In doing so, however, a court need not accept as true wholly conclusory \nallegations, Hanten v. Sch. Dist. of Riverview Gardens, 183 F.3d 799, 805 (8th \nCir. 1999), or legal conclusions drawn by the pleader from the facts alleged, Westcott v. \nCity of Omaha, 901 F.2d 1486, 1488 (8th Cir. 1990).  A court may consider the \ncomplaint, matters of public record, orders, materials embraced by the complaint, and \n16 \n \n\nexhibits attached to the complaint in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nPorous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp., 186 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir. 1999).   \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain “enough facts to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007).  Although a complaint need not contain “detailed factual allegations,” it must \ncontain facts with enough specificity “to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel.”  Id. at 555.  As the United States Supreme Court reiterated, “[t]hreadbare recitals \nof the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements,” will not \npass muster under Twombly.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  In sum, this standard “calls for enough fact[s] to raise a \nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the claim].”  Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 556. \nII.  Justiciability \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims are non-justiciable for two reasons.  First, \nDefendants assert that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims.  Second, with respect \nto Plaintiffs’ claim under the Medicaid Act’s reasonable promptness requirement, \nDefendants argue that this claim is not ripe for review. \nA.  Standing \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because they do not have a \nlegally-protected interest in the provision of dedicated, trained, person-centered planners \nand therefore they fail to allege an injury in fact.  Defendants also note that the Medicaid \nAct does not prohibit the provision of services in a congregate setting.  Because the \n17 \n \n\nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has not determined \nthat Plaintiffs’ residences are not home and community-based settings under applicable \nfederal regulations, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot establish an imminent injury.  \nIn addition, Defendants argue that because one of the plaintiffs did receive person-\ncentered-planning, she has no actual, concrete injury.  Finally, Defendants argue that \nPlaintiffs cannot demonstrate redressability because it is wholly speculative that the \nservices they seek will remedy the harm they allege.   \nPlaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that they have alleged a concrete injury—\nsegregation—which is caused by Defendants and which can be redressed by the \nrequested relief.  According to Plaintiffs, the relief they seek includes:  (1) reasonably \nprompt payment authorization and provision of services to develop individualized plans \nto move out of CRS facilities; and (2) reasonable modifications to the state’s residential \nservice system so that they will have an opportunity to implement these plans.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that Defendants’ arguments regarding standing ignore Plaintiffs’ fundamental \ninjury of segregation.   \n“[S]tanding is a jurisdictional prerequisite that must be resolved before reaching \nthe merits of a suit.”  City of Clarkson Valley v. Mineta, 495 F.3d 567, 569 (8th Cir. \n2007).  “The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing” \nstanding. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  The burden \ncorresponds with the degree of evidence required at the relevant stage of litigation.  Id.  \n“Where . . . a case is at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must ‘clearly . . . allege facts \ndemonstrating’ each element” of standing.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 \n18 \n \n\n(2016) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)).  However, at this stage, \n“general factual allegations of injury . . . may suffice.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see also \nIowa League of Cities v. E.P.A., 711 F.3d 844, 869 (8th Cir. 2013).  If a plaintiff lacks \nstanding, a district court has no subject matter jurisdiction over the matter and must \ndismiss the case.  Young Am. Corp. v. Affiliated Comp. Servs., Inc., 424 F.3d 840, 843 \n(8th Cir. 2005).   \nArticle III of the Constitution limits the power of the federal courts to deciding \nonly actual “cases” and “controversies.”  U.S. Const., art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  To establish \nconstitutional Article III standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate:  (1) an injury-in-fact; \n(2) a causal connection between that injury and the challenged conduct; and (3) the \nlikelihood that a favorable decision by the court will redress the alleged injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 560.  These constitutional requirements of standing limit federal courts to \ndeciding only cases where the plaintiffs can show a “personal injury fairly traceable to \nthe defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested \nrelief.”  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984).   \nThe injury-in-fact requirement requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that he has \nexperienced “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  With respect to statutory \nviolations, “Congress may ‘elevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, \nde facto injuries that were previously inadequate in law.’”  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at \n1549 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 578); see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at 578 (noting as an \n19 \n \n\nexample “injury to an individual’s personal interest in living in a racially integrated \ncommunity”).   \nWhere the plaintiff alleges a statutory violation, a concrete injury must still be \nestablished.  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1549.  However, the Supreme Court has \nexplained that, “[a]lthough tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize, . . . \nintangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.”  Id.  A procedural violation may also \nmeet the injury-in-fact requirement “‘so long as the procedures in question are designed \nto protect some threatened concrete interest of [the petitioner] that is the ultimate basis of \nhis standing.’”  Iowa League of Cities, 711 F.3d at 870-71 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n573 n.8).   \nA plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show that he “faces a threat of ongoing \nor future harm.”  Park v. Forest Serv. of the United States, 205 F.3d 1034, 1037 (8th \nCir. 2000).  “Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or \ncontroversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present \nadverse effects.”  O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974).  Likewise, a \nplaintiff’s speculation that a future injury may occur is not sufficient to warrant injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 497.  A plaintiff must show that the threat of injury is “real and immediate.”  \nId. at 496.   \nThe Supreme Court has explained that “[w]hen the suit is one challenging the \nlegality of government action or inaction” and “the plaintiff is himself an object of the \naction (or forgone action) at issue . . ., there is ordinarily little question that the action or \ninaction has caused him injury, and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action \n20 \n \n\nwill redress it.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. 561-62; see also Iowa League of Cities, 711 F.3d at 871.  \nHowever, establishing redressability requires the plaintiff to show that it is “more than \nmerely speculative that the relief requested would have any effect to redress the harm to \nthe plaintiff.”  Young Am. Corp., 424 F.3d at 845 (quoting Hall v. LHACO, Inc., 140 F.3d \n1190, 1196 (8th Cir. 1998)). \nThe primary injury Plaintiffs allege they are facing is segregation.  While perhaps \nnot tangible, this injury is indeed concrete and particular to Plaintiffs.  Through the ADA \nand the RA, Congress has elevated the segregation of individuals with disabilities “to the \nstatus of [a] legally cognizable injur[y].”  See Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1549 (quoting \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 578); see also Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1023-24 (providing \nan overview of relevant ADA and RA provisions).  In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs \nallege particular and personal examples of segregation.  For example, Murphy asserts he \n“spends most of his time alone,” despite wishing “to interact with other people.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 29(g).)  Bottelson asserts that she “does not get out into the community nearly \nas much as she would if she were able to create her own schedule.”  (Id. ¶ 30(f).)  \nSwanson alleges that she has been told “she is not ‘independent enough’ for \nindividualized housing,” and asserts a need for services so that she can “live in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to her needs.”  (Id. ¶¶ 31(b), 31(e).)  Plaintiffs also allege \nthat the injury of segregation can itself result in further harm for many individuals \nresiding in CRS facilities, including diminished “social and independent living skills,” \ndecreased likelihood of “living and working in the community” in the future, and “lower \nself-esteem and lowered expectations of themselves.”  (Id. ¶¶ 78-79.)  These allegations \n21 \n \n\nsufficiently establish an injury-in-fact to support Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA and \nthe RA. \nPlaintiffs’ concrete injury of segregation also supports standing to pursue their \nMedicaid Act and Due Process claims.  As further discussed below, the Medicaid Act’s \nreasonable promptness and fair hearing requirements create privately enforceable rights \nthat can be asserted in a § 1983 claim.  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint illustrates how the \nalleged statutory violations of these provisions and the alleged violations of Plaintiffs’ \nFourteenth Amendment Due Process rights correlate with the concrete injury they are \nfacing through their ongoing segregation.  In particular, Plaintiffs allege that they each \nreceive a Disability Waiver to fund certain services.  (Id. ¶ 2.)  Plaintiffs allege that the \nservices available under the Disability Waivers are “designed to help people with \ndisabilities live in his or her own home and interact with the larger nondisabled \ncommunity.”  (Id. ¶¶ 33-34.)  Plaintiffs also allege that specific Disability Waiver \nservices, described as “individualized housing services,” exist that would permit them “to \ndesign and implement a customized setting for [them] to live, work, and enjoy leisure \ntime in the most integrated setting.”  (Id. ¶¶ 7, 82.)  According to Plaintiffs, they are \npresently experiencing the concrete harm of segregation from their community because \nthey are not receiving these services in a reasonably prompt manner (or at all) and have \n22 \n \n\nnot received notice or information necessary to exercise their due process rights.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs have standing to pursue these claims.3 \nIn light of the Court’s conclusions regarding Plaintiffs’ injury-in-fact, the Court \nconcludes there is “little question” that Plaintiffs have adequately established causation \nand redressability at this stage.  Lujan, 504 U.S. 561-62; see also Iowa League of Cities, \n711 F.3d at 871.  Plaintiffs allege numerous actions and inactions undertaken by \nDefendants that are causally connected to Plaintiffs’ failure to receive individualized \nhousing services and their resulting segregation.  For example, Plaintiffs contend that \n“Defendants approve the funding of Disability Waiver services in CRS facilities while \nfailing to ensure that such a setting is the most integrated setting appropriate for the \nindividual.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 70.)  Plaintiffs also allege that Commissioner Johnson Piper \n“has failed to establish administrative procedures that ensure individuals who are \nqualified for and requesting services to help transition to a more integrated setting will \nactually receive those services.”  (Id. ¶ 107.)  Based on the detailed allegations in the \nAmended Complaint relating to Defendants’ role in overseeing the provision of \nDisability Waiver services throughout the state, Plaintiffs have established causation to \nsupport standing. \n                                                           \n3   The Court reaches this conclusion with respect to all named Plaintiffs, \nnotwithstanding the fact that Bottelson alleges receiving some person-centered-planning \nservices in the past.  (See id. ¶ 30(k).)  According to the Complaint, Bottelson has \nnonetheless “not received all the necessary individualized housing services to help her \nfind or develop alternatives to her current CRS facility.”  (Id.)  Thus, the Court concludes \nthat Bottelson has standing to challenge Defendants’ failure to ensure she has received all \nsuch services. \n23 \n \n\nAt the pleading stage, Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged that it is likely that \ntheir alleged injury will be redressed by the relief sought.  Plaintiffs request declaratory \nand injunctive relief tied to Defendants’ purported violations of the Medicaid Act, the \nFourteenth Amendment, the ADA, and the RA.  In particular, Plaintiffs request an \ninjunction that would require Defendants to provide prompt notice regarding the \navailability of individualized housing services to Disability Waiver recipients living in \nCRS facilities.  (Am. Compl. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4(a).)  Plaintiffs also seek an order \ndirecting Defendants to “provide access and take prompt steps to make individualized \nhousing services, including person-centered planning, available to Plaintiffs in a \nreasonable amount of time.”  (Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4(b).)  In addition, Plaintiffs \nrequest injunctive relief requiring Defendants to take the necessary steps “to enable \nPlaintiffs to receive residential services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \nneeds.”  (Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4(c).)  The Court is persuaded at this stage that these \nmeasures would likely redress Plaintiffs’ alleged harms.  To be sure, Plaintiffs must \nultimately provide evidence to support their allegations relating to the effectiveness of \nindividualized housing services in leading to greater integration in the community.  At \nthis stage, however, Plaintiffs’ factual allegations suffice to establish standing. \nIn sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately established standing.  \nWith respect to each claim, Plaintiffs allege particular, concrete harms to their \nlegally-protected interests which are caused by Defendants and likely to be redressed by \nthe requested relief.  In particular, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately \nestablished standing to pursue injunctive relief by alleging “ongoing . . . harm” and \n24 \n \n\n“continuing, present adverse effects” of Defendants’ prior conduct.  See Park, 205 F.3d at \n1037; O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 495-96. \nB.  Ripeness \nDefendants also question the justiciability of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint with \nrespect to Count I, Plaintiffs’ Medicaid Act’s reasonable promptness claim.  According to \nDefendants, this claim is not ripe because federal regulations relating to the provision of \nhome and community-based waiver services have established a transition period for \nstates to come into compliance with new regulations defining what constitutes a \ncommunity-based setting.  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim \nis not ripe because the state is in the process of implementing a transition plan to come \ninto compliance with these regulations, and the state does not need to establish \ncompliance until the transition period is over. \nPlaintiffs counter that their claims are ripe.  Plaintiffs assert that they have alleged \na direct injury, and the issues presented are fit for judicial review.  Plaintiffs argue that \nDefendants’ violations of the reasonable promptness provision result in actual ongoing \nharms and do not depend on contingent future events.  In addition, Plaintiffs suggest that \nDefendants have not articulated how further factual developments relating to the new \nfederal regulations will address Plaintiffs’ claims under the reasonable promptness \nprovision.  Plaintiffs contend that their harms will continue to exist even if the HHS \nSecretary determines that the settings in which they reside are “community-based” under \nthe 2014 rule.  \n25 \n \n\nAs with standing, the ripeness doctrine ensures that a court’s exercise of \njurisdiction meets both the constitutional requirements of Article III and prudential \nlimitations.  See Neb. Pub. Power Dist. v. MidAmerican Energy Co., 234 F.3d 1032, 1037 \n(8th Cir. 2000).  The Supreme Court has explained: \n[The ripeness doctrine’s] basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through \navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in \nabstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the \nagencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been \nformalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.  \nThe problem is best seen in a twofold aspect, requiring us to evaluate both \nthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties \nof withholding court consideration.   \n \nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967).   \nUnder the fitness factor, “[t]he case is more likely to be ripe if it poses a purely \nlegal question and is not contingent on future possibilities.”  Pub. Water Supply Dist. \nNo. 10 of Cass Cty. v. City of Peculiar, Mo., 345 F.3d 570, 573 (8th Cir. 2003); see also \nParrish v. Dayton, 761 F.3d 873, 875-76 (8th Cir. 2014).  Even if a dispute raises some \ncontingencies, however, a court may properly exercise review “where an issue is largely \nlegal in nature, may be resolved without further factual development, or where judicial \nresolution will largely settle the parties’ dispute.”  Neb. Pub. Power, 234 F.3d at 1038 \n(citations omitted).   \nUnder the hardship factor, a court may consider both financial harm and harm \ncaused by “uncertainty-induced behavior modification in the absence of judicial review.”  \nIowa League of Cities, 711 F.3d at 867.  The immediacy and directness of the harm is \nalso relevant.  See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 152.  The ripeness factors “are weighed on a \n26 \n \n\nsliding scale, but each must be satisfied ‘to at least a minimal degree.’”  Iowa League of \nCities, 711 F.3d at 867. \nThe Eighth Circuit has previously identified “the extent to which judicial \nintervention would interfere with administrative action” as a third relevant factor in the \nripeness inquiry.  Nat’l Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Connor, 323 F.3d 684, \n692-93 (8th Cir. 2003).  An assertion of ongoing agency action, however, will not always \nprevent the court’s exercise of jurisdiction.  See 13B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice & Procedure § 3532.6 (3d ed. Apr. 2017 Update) (“[A]ny agency attempt to \ndefeat review by the bare assertion that the agency position may some day change should \nbe summarily rejected.”).  In addition, “protracted inaction by state officials may itself be \na wrong, or at least defeat any claim that a federal court should await further state \ndevelopments.”  Id. § 3532.3; see also Groome Resources Ltd., L.L.C. v. Parish of \nJefferson, 234 F.3d 192, 199-200 (5th Cir. 2000).  Further, ripeness is not automatically \ndefeated by ongoing revision or implementation of an administrative agency’s regulatory \nplan, see Ohio Envtl. Council v. U.S. Dist. Court, S. Dist. of Oh., E. Div., 565 F.2d 393, \n397-98 (6th Cir. 1977), or by the possibility of future regulatory changes, see Am. \nPetroleum Inst. v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 906 F.2d 729, 739-40 (D.C. Cir. 1990). \nThe Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim is presently ripe \nfor review.  Under this claim, Plaintiffs present issues that are fit for judicial review, and \nthe Court is not persuaded that further factual developments will materially impact the \nCourt’s analysis of this claim.  Even if the CRS facilities in which Plaintiffs reside are \neventually determined not to run afoul of the home and community-based service \n27 \n \n\nregulations regarding congregate settings, Plaintiffs presently have a viable claim based \non Defendants’ failure to ensure prompt provision of individualized housing services \nunder the Disability Waivers.  Plaintiffs allege that Disability Waiver funds can be \nutilized “to design and implement a customized setting for the individual to live, work, \nand enjoy leisure time in the most integrated setting.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 7.)  Such a setting \nmay also include “homes of their own.”  (Id. ¶ 84.)   \nNotwithstanding the ultimate determination under new federal regulations \nregarding whether the CRS facilities in which Plaintiffs reside are determined to be \nproper settings in which Disability Waiver funding can be utilized, Plaintiffs assert that \nthese facilities are not the most integrated setting for them at this time.  (Id. ¶¶ 29(m), \n30(f), 31(e).)  The resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims, therefore, does not depend on further \nfactual developments relating to the new federal regulations.  In addition, as the Court \ndetailed above, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that they are presently facing direct, \nongoing harms based on Defendants’ alleged failure to provide reasonably prompt access \nto Disability Waiver services that could facilitate their transition to more integrated \nsettings.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that Defendants have implemented certain plans and \nprotocols in these areas, but allege that these measures are inadequate to remedy their \nalleged harms.  (See id. ¶¶ 53-63.)  Although Defendants are implementing a transition \nplan that may impact the Court’s evaluation of Plaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim, \nthe Court concludes this claim is ripe. \n28 \n \n\nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Claims \nA.  Count I:  Reasonable Promptness Under the Medicaid Act \nCount I of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint alleges a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nthrough failure to furnish services with reasonable promptness in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(8).  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim with respect to \nCount I. \nThe reasonable promptness requirement provides that “[a] State plan for medical \nassistance must . . . provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical \nassistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be \nfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(8).  Payment for home and community-based Disability Waiver services is \ndeemed “medical assistance” under the Medicaid Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1).  \nRegulations also require the state to establish time standards to determine an individual’s \neligibility for Medicaid in no more than ninety days and to “[f]urnish Medicaid promptly \nto beneficiaries without any delay caused by the agency’s administrative procedures.”  \nSee 42 C.F.R. § 435.912; id. § 435.930; see also Doe ex rel. Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709, \n717 (11th Cir. 1998); Boulet v. Cellucci, 107 F. Supp. 2d 61, 72-73 (D. Mass. 2000).   \nPlaintiffs assert their reasonable promptness claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \nBefore proceeding to Defendants’ particular challenges to Plaintiffs’ reasonable \npromptness claim, the Court incorporates and adopts its analysis and holding in \nGuggenberger and concludes that the reasonable promptness provision is privately \nenforceable under § 1983 for eligible individuals.  See Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at \n29 \n \n\n1006-07.  Plaintiffs, current Disability Waiver recipients, may privately enforce their \nright to reasonably prompt medical assistance via § 1983 in this case. \nDefendants raise numerous challenges to Plaintiffs’ claim alleging a violation of \nthe Medicaid Act’s reasonable promptness requirement.  First, Defendants assert that \nPlaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim is inadequately pled because Plaintiffs have \nfailed to allege facts regarding how long they have waited for services.  Defendants point \nto cases in which plaintiffs alleged waiting several years for waiver services.  Here, \nhowever, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have made no such factual allegations.  \nSecond, Defendants assert that waiver services are not an entitlement, and guidance from \nthe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) suggests states cannot be held \nresponsible for delays resulting from a lack of available providers.  Defendants also \nreference the five-year transition period for bringing state Medicaid plans into \ncompliance with the new federal regulations relating to home and community based \nservices and person-centered planning.  Third, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have \nfailed to allege that “individualized housing services” were requested by Plaintiffs or \nauthorized by counties.  Defendants assert that “[w]ithout more detailed allegations \nregarding determination of need and prior authorization,” Plaintiffs’ reasonable \npromptness claim fails.  (Doc. No. 24 at 5-6.)  Fourth, Defendants acknowledge that the \nMedicaid Act defines “medical assistance” to include payment or provision of services or \nboth, but argue that states need not provide all services. \nPlaintiffs argue that they have pled a viable reasonable promptness claim.  First, \nPlaintiffs argue that “Defendants’ inconsistent management of the [Disability Waiver \n30 \n \n\nprogram] . . . prevents Plaintiffs from being authorized for receiving these services, let \nalone in a timely manner (and sometimes at all).”  (Doc. No. 22 at 26.)  Plaintiffs contend \nthat they have adequately alleged that they made requests for services and have not \nreceived such services for varying periods of time or indefinitely.  Second, Plaintiffs \nargue that the reasonable promptness requirement applies to both payment for and \nprovision of services.  Third, Plaintiffs argue that there is no particular time frame \nrequired to state a reasonable promptness claim.  Plaintiffs also suggest that the deadline \nto comply with new federal regulations governing Disability Waivers does not make \nDefendants’ delay in this case reasonably prompt.  Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that the \nreasonable promptness provision applies to Disability Waiver services even if they are \nnot an absolute entitlement. \nThe Court again finds its prior analysis and reasoning in Guggenberger to be \ninstructive.  See generally Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1007-14.  The plaintiffs in \nGuggenberger asserted a § 1396a(a)(8) reasonable promptness claim based on being \nplaced on waiting lists for Disability Waiver services when funds were allegedly \navailable to provide them with services.  Id. at 1013.  The Court summarized relevant \ncaselaw pertinent to the reasonable promptness inquiry and identified multiple relevant \n“principles courts should consider when applying § 1396a(a)(8)’s requirement that \nmedical assistance ‘shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible \nindividuals’ in the context of Waiver Services.”  Id. at 1012.   \nFirst, “individuals who qualify for Waiver Services do not have an absolute \nentitlement to such services.”  Id.  As numerous courts have determined, some limits on \n31 \n \n\nthe allocation of Disability Waiver services may be appropriate and reasonable.  See id. \n(citing Bertrand v. Maram, 495 F.3d 452, 457 (7th Cir. 2007); Bryson v. Shumway, 308 \nF.3d 79, 86 (1st Cir. 2002); Susan J. v. Riley, 254 F.R.D. 439, 448 (M.D. Ala. 2008); \nMakin ex rel. Russell v. Hawaii, 114 F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1021-23 (D. Haw. 1999)).  At the \nsame time, “with respect to otherwise eligible individuals . . . for whom funding is \navailable, a state’s failure to fill available waiver slots or use funding appropriated for \nWaiver Services may violate the reasonable promptness requirement or at least raise \nquestions as to whether such a violation has occurred.”  Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d \nat 1012 (citing Bryson, 308 F.3d at 89; Lewis v. New Mexico Dep’t of Health, \n275 F. Supp. 2d 1319, 1345 (D.N.M. 2003); Boulet, 107 F. Supp. 2d at 78-89; Makin, \n114 F. Supp. 2d at 1028, 1031).  In particular, “[b]ecause Medicaid regulations require \nthe state to ‘[f]urnish Medicaid promptly to beneficiaries without any delay caused by the \nagency’s administrative procedures,’ see 42 C.F.R. § 435.930, a state’s mismanagement \nof allocated funding, which leads to an unreasonable delay in the provision of services, \nmay establish a violation of the reasonable promptness requirement.”  Guggenberger, \n198 F. Supp. 3d at 1012.  In Guggenberger, the Court determined under these principles \nthat the plaintiffs plausibly stated a reasonable promptness claim based on the state \ndefendants’ alleged mismanagement of available Waiver Services funding.  Id. at 1013. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs are not on waiting lists but rather are actually enrolled \nrecipients of a Disability Waiver.  Their reasonable promptness claim rests on the \nallegedly unwarranted delay in receiving access to certain services available under the \nDisability Waivers.  Along with the principles summarized above and discussed in \n32 \n \n\nGuggenberger, Defendants have identified relevant HHS Guidance that provides \nadditional principles to illuminate the Court’s analysis of this claim.  See U.S. Dep’t of \nHealth & Human Services, Olmstead Update No: 4, HCFA Update (Jan. 10, 2001) \n(“2001 HHS Guidance”), available at Doc. No. 13-1 at 36.  According to this guidance, \n“[a] State is obliged to provide all people enrolled in the waiver with the opportunity for \naccess to all needed services covered by the waiver and the Medicaid State plan.”  Id. \nat 5.  As with the placement of individuals onto Disability Waivers itself, however, states \nmay reasonably limit access to services available under a waiver.  Specifically, “[t]he \nState may impose reasonable and appropriate limits or utilization control procedures \nbased on the need that individuals have for services covered under the waiver.”  Id. at \n5-6.   \nThus, whether an individual has a right to receive a certain service “is dependent \non a finding that the individual needs the service, based on appropriate assessment \ncriteria that the State develops and applies fairly to all waiver enrollees.”  Id. at 6.  In \naddition, the HHS guidance acknowledges that states may be limited in their ability to \ntimely provide certain services based on constraints such as “supply of providers, or \nsimilar factors.”  Id.  While recognizing these limits, the 2001 HHS Guidance also notes \nthe following important principle:  “Once in the waiver, an enrolled individual enjoys \nprotection against arbitrary acts or inappropriate restrictions, and the State assumes an \nobligation to assure the individual’s health and welfare.”  Id.  Ultimately, “the question of \nreasonable promptness is a difficult one,” and many variables must be considered to \nevaluate whether a state is providing needed Disability Waiver services in a reasonably \n33 \n \n\nprompt manner.  See id. (noting variables including “[t]he urgency of an individual’s \nneed, the health and welfare concerns of the individual, the nature of the services \nrequired, the potential need to increase the supply of providers, [and] the availability of \nsimilar or alternative services”).   \nAt this stage, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have stated a viable reasonable \npromptness claim based on Defendants’ alleged failure to ensure reasonably prompt \naccess to the individualized housing services they seek.  Defendants acknowledge that the \nparticular services Plaintiffs identify in their Amended Complaint—Housing Access \nCoordination and Transition Services and Family Training and Counseling—are \navailable under the Disability Waivers.  (Doc. No. 12 at 4-5.)  Specifically, Defendants \nagree that “waiver services will cover the cost of a dedicated, professional \nperson-centered planner.”  (Doc. No. 12 at 12.)  However, Defendants simply assert that \nthey cannot be required to provide these services upon request.  In particular, Defendants \nargue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim because they have not alleged the particular \nlengths of time they have been waiting and have not alleged that they were authorized by \nlocal agencies to receive the requested services.   \nFirst, the Court disagrees that individuals must allege a particular length of delay \nto adequately state a violation of the reasonable promptness provision.  Here, Plaintiffs \nassert that they have made requests for services and yet remain “stuck” in their current \nliving arrangements.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 29(k), 29(m), 29(n), 30(d), 30(k), 30(l), 31(e), \n31(f).)  Murphy asserts his guardian “has asked several people at the lead agency about \naccessing more individualized housing options.”  (Id. ¶ 29(k).)  Bottelson has similarly \n34 \n \n\nmade requests of multiple case managers since at least 2013.  (Id. ¶¶ 30(i), 30(j).)  \nSwanson alleges she has asked for individualized housing services “for a long time” \nwithout receiving any.  (Id. ¶ 31(f).)  Plaintiffs also allege that “Defendants currently \napprove some limited individualized alternatives for a small number of Disability Waiver \nrecipients.”  (Id. ¶ 67.)  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ allegations of seemingly \narbitrary and inexplicable failures to adequately respond to requests for services \nadequately support a reasonable promptness claim. \nSecond, to the extent there remains any disagreement between the parties on this \nissue, the Court concludes that the reasonable promptness provision applies to both the \npayment for services and the provision of services themselves.  The Medicaid Act defines \n“medical assistance” as “payment of part or all of the cost of . . . care and services or the \ncare and services themselves, or both . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a).  The Court joins the \nnumerous other courts interpreting this statutory provision who have determined that \n“Congress intended to clarify that where the Medicaid Act refers to the provision of \nservices, a participating State is required to provide (or ensure the provision of) services, \nnot merely to pay for them.”  O.B. v. Norwood, 838 F.3d 837, 843 (7th Cir. 2016) \n(quoting A.H.R. v. Washington State Health Care Auth., 2016 WL 98513, at *12 (W.D. \nWash. Jan. 7, 2016)); see also Leonard v. Mackereth, 2014 WL 512456, at *6-7 (E.D. \nPenn. Feb. 10, 2014) (explaining how the legislative history underlying the amended \ndefinition of “medical assistance” supports this interpretation).  While numerous factors \nmust be evaluated to determine whether certain services are being provided in a \n35 \n \n\nreasonably prompt manner, the statutory language clearly covers both funding and \nservices. \nFinally, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ failure to allege prior authorization for \nindividualized housing services is not fatal to their claim.  Critically, Plaintiffs appear to \nagree that they have not been previously authorized for the services they seek.  However, \nthe Court concludes that this lack of authorization supports rather than undermines the \nsufficiency of Plaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim in this case.  Plaintiffs cannot \nallege facts to show that they have been previously authorized for individualized housing \nservices because their county case managers have failed to even offer such services as a \nviable alternative to their current placement in CRS facilities.  This failure, Plaintiffs \nallege, is due to Defendants’ lack of oversight to ensure that individualized housing \nservices are offered and ultimately authorized by counties statewide.  (See Am. Compl. \n¶ 107.)  Although states may limit the provision of Waiver Services to enrolled \nindividuals “based on appropriate assessment criteria” which are “applie[d] fairly to all \nwaiver enrollees,” a state may not engage in “arbitrary acts” and cannot impose \n“inappropriate restrictions” on the provision of services once an individual is enrolled in \na Disability Waiver.  See 2001 HHS Guidance.   \nAt this stage, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that they are not being offered \nservices in a reasonably prompt manner based on arbitrary or nonexistent assessment \ncriteria.  According to Plaintiffs, counties either fail to adequately assess their need for \nindividualized housing services or fail to even mention the availability of such services, \nresulting in an unreasonable delay in the provision of services covered under the \n36 \n \n\nDisability Waivers.  In light of the complex, fact-specific inquiry required to evaluate a \nreasonable promptness claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately stated a \nviable claim.  Thus, the Court denies Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nreasonable promptness claim.4 \nB.  Count II:  Due Process  \nIn Count II of their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege a violation of their due \nprocess rights under both the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the \nMedicaid Act’s fair hearing requirements.  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have failed to \nstate a claim for a violation of their due process rights.  Defendants specifically challenge \nthis claim under the Fourteenth Amendment and do not directly challenge Plaintiffs’ \nallegations relating to the Medicaid Act.  However, the Court will address this claim \nunder both sources below to evaluate whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim. \n1.  Fourteenth Amendment Due Process \nWith respect to Plaintiffs’ Due Process claim, Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs \ndo not have a legally protected interest in the services they seek.  According to \nDefendants, Plaintiffs claim they have been denied “individualized housing services,” but \n                                                           \n4   The Court also concludes that the transition period to come into compliance with \nnew federal regulations relating to Disability Waiver services does not require dismissal \nof Plaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim.  Defendants appear to be raising the CMS \nRegulations and the corresponding transition period as a defense to Plaintiffs’ reasonable \npromptness claim.  While such a defense may impact the Court’s ultimate analysis of \nPlaintiffs’ claims, the Court concludes this argument is premature.  Cf. Wagner v. Dept. \nof Health Servs., 2013 WL 3776327, at *7 (W.D. Wis. July 17, 2013) (“At best, this \nargument is premature.  At this stage, defendants cannot seek to dismiss the complaint for \nfailure to state a claim by invoking the specter of arguments that they may later raise in \ndefense or, at least, on a more complete record.”).   \n37 \n \n\nfail to define what this means.  Accordingly, Defendants argue, the Court cannot \ndetermine whether Plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement to these services to \nsupport their Due Process claim.  Further, Defendants assert that this Court has held that \nDisability Waiver services are not an entitlement.  Defendants also argue that Disability \nWaivers provide payment for services not the services themselves.  Second, Defendants \nargue that even if Plaintiffs have a protectable interest, they have an opportunity to appeal \nan adverse determination under Minnesota law.  Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs \nadmit that they receive notice during the MnCHOICES assessment process and because \nMinnesota law provides for an opportunity to be heard, their claim fails as a matter of \nlaw.  In addition, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs must exhaust available state remedies \nbefore asserting a § 1983 Due Process claim. \nPlaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that they have a legally protected property \ninterest in Disability Waiver services as enrolled Disability Waiver recipients based on \nfederal and state law governing Disability Waivers.  Plaintiffs note that Defendants admit \nthat several of the services Plaintiffs seek are covered under the Disability Waivers.  With \nrespect to available state remedies, Plaintiffs argue that the legal right to appeal under \nstate law is not sufficient to resolve their Due Process claim because Plaintiffs have not \nbeen given adequate notice outlining the reasons for the denial or services or how to \nchallenge these denials.  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have routinely failed to provide \nproper written notice in violation of their Due Process rights.  Plaintiffs also point to the \nCourt’s recent decision in Guggenberger to suggest that Defendants’ exhaustion \nargument does not preclude their Due Process claim. \n38 \n \n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the states from \n“depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV, § 1.  To state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate:  (1) the existence of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest; \nand (2) that the defendant deprived the plaintiff of that interest without constitutionally \nadequate process.  See Kroupa v. Nielsen, 731 F.3d 813, 818 (8th Cir. 2013); Schmidt v. \nDes Moines Pub. Schs., 655 F.3d 811, 817 (8th Cir. 2011).  The Court concludes \nPlaintiffs have adequately stated a claim for a violation of their procedural due process \nrights. \nFirst, Plaintiffs have a legally protected property interest in Disability Waiver \nservices as Disability Waiver recipients.  “To have a property interest in a benefit, a \nperson . . . must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.  He must have more than \na unilateral expectation of it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to \nit.”  Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).  Property interests \narise not from the Constitution itself, but from “existing rules or understandings that stem \nfrom an independent source such as state law—rules or understandings that secure certain \nbenefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.”  Id.   \nIn Guggenberger, this Court explained “that Waiver Services are not an absolute \nentitlement given the limited nature of the Waiver Services program.”  198 F. Supp. 3d at \n1020.  At the same time, however, the Court concluded that “state and federal statutes \ncreate a legitimate claim of entitlement to Waiver Services for eligible individuals who \nmeet the state’s priority criteria and for whom there is sufficient funding available.”  Id.  \n39 \n \n\nThus, the Court concluded that the plaintiffs in Guggenberger—eligible individuals on \nwaiting lists for Disability Waiver services—adequately established that they had a \nlegally protected property interest to support a due process claim by alleging that there \nwas funding available to provide them with services.  Id. \nHere, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have an even clearer entitlement to the \nservices they seek as they are already enrolled Disability Waiver recipients.  Under \nMinnesota law, “[t]he commissioner shall apply for the home and community-based \nwaivers in order to . . . promote the support of persons with disabilities in the most \nintegrated settings.”  Minn. Stat. § 256B.49, subd. 11(a)(1).  Services under the Disability \nWaivers “shall promote consumer choice, community inclusion, self-sufficiency, and \nself-determination.”  Id. § 256B.49, subd. 16(a).  The commissioner is directed to \n“simplify and improve access to home and community-based waivered services, to the \nextent possible, through the establishment of a common service menu that is available to \neligible recipients regardless of age, disability type, or waiver program.”  Id. § 256B.49, \nsubd. 16(b).   \nDisability Waiver recipients must be provided “case management services” which \nprovide assistance in accessing services.  Id. § 256B.49, subd. 13; see also id. \n§ 256B.092, subd. 1a.  For example, case management includes “assisting the recipient to \naccess services and assisting with appeals” as well as “coordinating, evaluating, and \nmonitoring of the services identified in the service plan.”  Id. § 256B.49, \nsubd.13(a)(4)-(5).  Case managers exercise “professional judgment” and may not \ndelegate their responsibility over certain aspects of their duties, including the “ongoing \n40 \n \n\nassessment and monitoring of the person’s needs and adequacy of the approved \ncoordinated service and support plan” and “adjustments to the coordinated service and \nsupport plan.”  Id. § 256B.49, subd. 13(b)(2)-(3).  In addition, Minnesota law requires \nCommissioner Johnson Piper to “take the necessary safeguards to protect the health and \nwelfare of individuals provided services under the waiver.”  Id. § 256B.49, subd. 19.   \nConsistent with these state law provisions, Plaintiffs allege that the Disability \nWaivers are designed to ensure access to a variety of services which enable individuals \nwith disabilities to be integrated into their communities.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 33-34.)  \nFurther, Plaintiffs allege that individualized housing services are available under the \nDisability Waivers.  (Id. ¶ 7, 25, 84.)  At this stage and in light of Plaintiffs’ allegations \nregarding the availability of the services they seek under the Disability Waivers, \nPlaintiffs have plausibly established that they have a “legitimate claim of entitlement to” \nindividualized housing services.  See Roth, 408 U.S. at 577. \nSecond, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that they have not received adequate \nprocedural protections.  “The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity \nto be heard ‘at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.’”  Mathews v. Eldridge, \n424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976) (quoting Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965)).  The \nopportunity to be heard must be coupled with “notice reasonably calculated, under all the \ncircumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them \nan opportunity to present their objections.”  Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., \n339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).  The requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard are \nnecessarily intertwined and dependent upon one another:  “Adequate notice is integral to \n41 \n \n\nthe due process right to a fair hearing, for the ‘right to be heard has little reality or worth \nunless one is informed.’”  Bliek v. Palmer, 102 F.3d 1472, 1475 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting \nMullane, 339 U.S. at 314). \nUltimately, the requirements of due process are flexible and depend upon the \nparticular situation involved and the interests at stake.  See Mathews, 424 U.S. at 334.  In \nevaluating the sufficiency of the available procedures, courts consider three factors:   \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, \nthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures \nused, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural \nsafeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the function \ninvolved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail. \n \nId. at 335. \nPlaintiffs allege they have received no notice or information about their due \nprocess rights in connection with the determinations by lead agencies to deny them \nindividualized housing services.  (See id. ¶¶ 29(n); 30(l); 31(f).)  In particular, Plaintiffs \nallege that Commissioner Johnson Piper has “failed to provide Plaintiffs notice of adverse \naction and opportunity to challenge the failure to provide these individualized housing \nservices” and has also failed to require lead agencies to do so.  (Id. ¶¶ 112-13.)  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, “[t]hese failures have resulted in ongoing harm and Plaintiffs’ \ncontinued inability to receive individualized housing services.”  (Id. ¶ 114.)   \nAt this stage, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged inadequate \nprocedural protections under the Mathews factors.  As in Guggenberger, “Plaintiffs have \na legitimate and important interest in the services they seek which would enable them to \n42 \n \n\nmore fully integrate into their communities and achieve independence in their lives like \nindividuals without disabilities.”  See 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1021.  Also like in \nGuggenberger, “the risk of erroneous deprivation is significant if individuals have no \nknowledge of the factual basis underlying the decision to [deny them services] and no \nmeaningful opportunity to challenge that decision.”  See id.  Finally, “the government \nwould not be unduly burdened by a requirement that Defendants ensure counties provide \na detailed notice explaining the reasons for [denying individualized housing services] and \nexplaining that such [denial] can be appealed under existing state administrative \nprocedures.”  See id.   \nThird, although exhaustion of state administrative remedies is required prior to \nasserting a § 1983 due process claim challenging the adequacy of postdeprivation \nprocedures, such exhaustion is not required when a plaintiff challenges predeprivation \nprocedures such as inadequate notice.  See Raymond v. Bd. of Regents, 847 F.3d 585, 590 \n(8th Cir. 2017) (“[I]t is not necessary for a litigant to have exhausted available \npostdeprivation remedies when the litigant contends that he was entitled to \npredeprivation process.” (quoting Keating v. Neb. Pub. Power Dist., 562 F.3d 923, 929 \n(8th Cir. 2009))).  Notwithstanding the availability of state appeal rights by which \nindividuals with disabilities can purportedly challenge improper service denials, see \nMinn. Stat. § 256.045, subd. 3, Plaintiffs here allege inadequate predeprivation process in \nthe form of specific notices that would facilitate a meaningful right to be heard.  See \nBliek, 102 F.3d at 1476 (“A plainly written, informative notice is imperative . . . to make \nthe hearing to which the plaintiffs are entitled meaningful.”).  Thus, Plaintiffs’ § 1983 \n43 \n \n\nclaim is not subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust state appeal rights.  The Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claim should proceed. \n2.  Medicaid Act Fair Hearing Requirement \nPlaintiffs’ § 1983 Due Process claim also rests on the Medicaid Act’s notice and \nhearing requirements outlined in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) and corresponding regulations.  \nDefendants have not raised specific arguments to challenge the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ \nclaim on this basis.  The Court will nonetheless address the Medicaid Act’s requirements \nas they support and reinforce Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claim. \nThe Medicaid Act requires state plans to “provide for granting an opportunity for a \nfair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance \n. . . is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3).  \nFurther, when “the agency denies an individual’s claim for eligibility, benefits or \nservices,” the agency must provide the beneficiary with written notice of the right to a \nhearing, the method of obtaining a hearing, and the right to represent oneself or use a \nrepresentative.  42 C.F.R. § 431.206.  Such notice must include “[a] statement of what \naction the agency . . . intends to take” along with “[a] clear statement of the specific \nreasons supporting the intended action.”  See id. § 431.210.  Plaintiffs assert a § 1983 \nclaim against Defendants based on their purported violation of these fair hearing and \nnotice requirements.   \nThe Court hereby adopts and incorporates its analysis and holding in \nGuggenberger that the Medicaid Act’s fair hearing requirements under § 1396a(a)(3) are \nenforceable in a § 1983 claim by “any individual whose claim for medical assistance . . . \n44 \n \n\nis denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3).  \nIn light of Plaintiffs’ allegations of being denied reasonably prompt access to \nindividualized housing services without adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard in \nconnection with such denials, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged \nviolations of their due process rights under the Medicaid Act’s fair hearing requirements.   \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged violations of their due process rights \nunder both the Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act’s fair hearing requirements.  \nThus, the Court denies Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on this basis. \nC.  Counts III & IV:  Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and \n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nCounts III and IV of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint allege violations of Title II of \nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and § 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  Defendants \nargue that Plaintiffs have failed to state viable claims under either provision.   \nFirst, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ RA claim must fail because Plaintiffs have \nnot pled that their disabilities were the sole impetus for adverse action against them.  \nSecond, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that they have been \ninstitutionalized or face a risk of institutionalization which Defendants argue is necessary \nto support an integration mandate claim.  Defendants also assert that Plaintiffs’ \nintegration mandate claims are inadequately pled under the Supreme Court’s Olmstead \ndecision because Plaintiffs have not alleged that the State’s treatment professionals have \ndetermined their placement is inappropriate or that their requested relief can be \nreasonably accommodated taking into account the State’s resources and the needs of \n45 \n \n\nother individuals with disabilities.  Third, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ requested \nrelief would impermissibly require a fundamental alternation to the state’s provision of \nDisability Waiver services.  Defendants assert that it is not clear precisely what Plaintiffs \nseek, but argue that if they are seeking the provision of person-centered planning, that is \nnot required by the ADA.  Defendants also suggest that if Plaintiffs are seeking funding \nto permit them to live wherever they choose, such relief would require a fundamental \nalteration to the state’s Medicaid program.5  Ultimately, Defendants argue, Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief is impermissible based on the face of the Complaint because Plaintiffs \nseek relief which would not give leeway to the State in administering its programs. \nPlaintiffs dispute each of Defendants’ arguments for dismissal.  First, Plaintiffs \ndeny that they need to allege disability as the sole impetus for Defendants’ conduct to \nstate a viable RA claim.  Second, Plaintiffs argue that they need not allege that they are \ninstitutionalized or at imminent risk of institutionalization to advance an integration \nmandate claim.  According to Plaintiffs, their integration mandate claims are adequately \npled in light of their allegations that they are living in a setting that is not the most \nintegrated setting for their needs.  Plaintiffs also argue that they have adequately alleged \nthat their requested accommodations are reasonable.  Third, Plaintiffs suggest that \nDefendants’ fundamental alteration defense is premature.  In particular, Plaintiffs argue \n                                                           \n5   Defendants also assert that if Plaintiffs are seeking funding to live wherever they \nwant, such relief would violate Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  The Court \ndoes not construe Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint to seek such relief and therefore need \nnot reach this argument. \n46 \n \n\nthat whether the requested relief will cost more or less than the existing services is a \nquestion that cannot be properly resolved at this stage.  \nTitle II of the ADA, applicable to public entities, provides that “no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \nFurther, an implementing regulation referred to as the “integration mandate” states:  “A \npublic entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(d).  The preamble to these regulations describes “the most integrated setting” as \n“a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to \nthe fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B, Subp. B., § 35.130.  In addition, \npublic entities must “make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures \nwhen the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,” \nbut can avoid this obligation by “demonstrat[ing] that making the modifications would \nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(7).   \nThe RA includes similar provisions, including its own “integration mandate.”  See \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United \nStates . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) \n47 \n \n\n(“Recipients shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.”).  Given the similarities \nbetween the ADA and § 504 of the RA, “cases interpreting either are applicable and \ninterchangeable.”  Gorman v. Bartch, 152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998) (citation \nomitted). \nIn Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court \nanalyzed the ADA’s integration mandate and its relationship to claims of discrimination \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  In the context of claims brought by two women who were \ninstitutionalized despite their treatment providers’ opinions that they could be \nappropriately treated in the community, the Court held that “[u]njustified isolation . . . is \nproperly regarded as discrimination based on disability.”  Id. at 593-94, 597.  A plurality \nof the Court explained: \nUnder Title II of the ADA, States are required to provide community-based \ntreatment for persons with mental disabilities when the State’s treatment \nprofessionals determine that such placement is appropriate, the affected \npersons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and \nthe needs of others with mental disabilities.  \n \nId. at 607.  Further, the court determined that a state may successfully assert a \nfundamental alteration defense to an integration mandate claim if it could demonstrate it \nhad “a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental \ndisabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable \npace . . . .”  Id. at 605-06.  While it is Plaintiffs’ burden to establish that their requested \nmodifications would be a reasonable remedy to Defendants’ alleged violations of the \n48 \n \n\nintegration mandate, Defendants bear the burden of establishing that the requested relief \nwould fundamentally alter its programs or services.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); see \nalso Gorman, 152 F.3d at 912 (describing the fundamental alteration argument as an \naffirmative defense). \nIn Guggenberger, this Court recently evaluated many of the specific arguments \nDefendants have raised as a basis to dismiss Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims.  First, the \nCourt determined “that the Rehabilitation Act’s ‘solely by reason of . . . disability’ \nrequirement need not be separately analyzed in cases alleging a violation of the \nintegration mandate because the alleged discrimination—undue isolation—stems from a \nfailure to satisfy an affirmative duty, regardless of discriminatory intent.”  Guggenberger, \n198 F. Supp. 3d at 1032.  The Court adopts its analysis and holding in Guggenberger on \nthis issue, id. at 1031-33, and concludes that the Plaintiffs’ failure to allege that their \ndisabilities were the sole impetus underlying Defendants’ alleged discrimination against \nthem does not undermine their RA claim.   \nIf Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in establishing a violation of the integration \nmandate based on Defendants’ implementation of the Disability Waiver programs, \nPlaintiffs will have established that they were subject to discrimination based on their \ndisabilities.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597.  It is immaterial to the Court’s analysis \nwhether such discrimination is considered to be “by reason of . . . disability” as required \nby the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, or “solely by reason of . . . disability” as required by the \nRA, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  Thus, Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims under the ADA and \nthe RA can be analyzed together. \n49 \n \n\nTurning to Defendants’ next argument for dismissal, Plaintiffs’ failure to plead a \nrisk of institutionalization, the Court again adopts its prior reasoning in Guggenberger.  \nAfter considering the language of the integration mandate, Congress’s extensive findings \nin enacting the ADA, the Olmstead Court’s rationale, persuasive Department of Justice \n(“DOJ”) authority interpreting the integration mandate, and analogous interpretations in \nrecent caselaw, the Court concluded that “‘[u]njustified isolation . . . is properly regarded \nas discrimination based on disability’ beyond the limited scope of institutionalization.”  \nSee Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1026-28 (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597).  \nThus, the Court concluded that the Guggenberger plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims \ncould proceed notwithstanding their failure to allege that they were presently \ninstitutionalized or at risk of institutionalization.  Id. at 1029-30.  The Court hereby \nincorporates its holding and analysis in Guggenberger on this issue, id. at 1026-30, and \ndetermines that Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims under the ADA and RA may \nproceed although Plaintiffs are residing in CRS facilities and have not alleged that they \nare at risk of institutionalization.6 \n                                                           \n6   Defendants appear to question the Court’s reliance in Guggenberger on the \nSeventh Circuit’s recent decision in Steimel v. Wernert, 823 F.3d 902, 910-14 (7th Cir. \n2016), because the plaintiffs in Steimel alleged that they faced a risk of \ninstitutionalization.  To the extent Guggenberger suggests otherwise, the Court \nacknowledges that the Steimel plaintiffs made such allegations.  However, the Seventh \nCircuit’s holding in Steimel indicates that it would have recognized a viable Olmstead \nclaim even in the absence of these allegations.  In particular, the Seventh Circuit \nexplained, “the integration mandate is implicated where the state’s policies have either \n(1) segregated persons with disabilities in their own homes, or (2) put them at serious risk \nof institutionalization.”  Id. at 914.  It also determined that the integration mandate “bars \nunjustified segregation of persons with disabilities, wherever it takes place.”  Id. at 911; \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page) \n50 \n \n\nDefendants also challenge Plaintiffs’ failure to plead that the state’s treatment \nprofessionals have determined that the individualized housing options they seek are \nappropriate to meet their needs.  The Court does not find this to be a material pleading \ndeficiency in this case.  As noted above, the Supreme Court in Olmstead explained that \nwhether community-based treatment for individuals with disabilities is required is based \nin part on whether “the State’s treatment professionals [have] determine[d] that such \nplacement is appropriate.”  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.  However, as one court \nrecently noted, “[t]he language in Olmstead concerning determinations by the state’s \ntreatment professionals appears to be based on the particular facts at hand and not \nfundamental to the Court’s holding.”  See Dunakin v. Quigley, 99 F. Supp. 3d 1297, 1318 \nn.8 (W.D. Wash. 2015).   \nLike their reasonable promptness claim, Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims rest \nin large part on Defendants’ failure to ensure that Plaintiffs are fairly offered and \nprovided individualized housing services.  Thus, Defendants’ alleged actions have \nprevented Plaintiffs from being evaluated for the services they seek, precluding an \nallegation that the state’s treatment professionals have determined that any alternate \nplacements are appropriate.  See id. at 1318-19 & n.8 (noting that the plaintiff “alleges \nthat he has been denied the evaluation necessary to determine whether [a community-\nbased] placement is appropriate” and concluding that the failure to include allegations \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(Footnote Continued From Previous Page) \nsee also Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1028 (discussing Steimel and identifying these \nholdings).  The Court once again concludes that Steimel supports a broad application of \nthe integration mandate even where no risk of institutionalization is alleged. \n51 \n \n\nrelating to a state treatment professional’s determination was not fatal to his ADA and \nRA claims).   \nPlaintiffs allege that an assessment process is required before individuals receive \nDisability Waiver services.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 68.)  According to Plaintiffs, “[i]f \n[individuals] qualify, the lead agency should offer the individual Disability Waiver \nservices as an alternative to services in an institution.”  (Id.)  Plaintiffs allege they are \npresently receiving Disability Waivers and residing in CRS facilities.  Although lead \nagencies are required to create plans for Disability Waiver recipients “that identif[y] his \nor her needs and the types of services necessary and available to meet those needs,” \nPlaintiffs allege that “Defendants do not ensure . . . that individuals are receiving services \nin the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.”  (Id. ¶ 69.)  Under the facts of \nthis case, therefore, Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims are adequately pled \nnotwithstanding their failure to allege facts relating to placement determinations by the \nstate’s treatment professionals.7   \n                                                           \n7   To be sure, the views of the state’s treatment professionals will ultimately be \nrelevant to determine whether Plaintiffs can appropriately be treated in more integrated \nsettings as they allege.  As noted in Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion in Olmstead, \n“it would be a tragic event . . . were the [ADA] to be interpreted so that States had some \nincentive, for fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of \nappropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.”  527 U.S. at \n610 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  As a result, “[t]he opinion of a responsible treating \nphysician in determining the appropriate conditions for treatment ought to be given the \ngreatest of deference.”  Id.  Where a plaintiff’s integration mandate claim is based in part \non the failure to be assessed, however, it would be unreasonable to dismiss such a claim \nfor failure to allege facts relating to the (nonexistent) determinations of the state’s \ntreatment professionals. \n52 \n \n\nPlaintiffs have adequately pled integration mandate claims under the ADA and the \nRA based on their allegations of being unduly segregated in CRS facilities and not \nreceiving Disability Waiver services “in the most integrated setting appropriate to [their] \nneeds.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).  Plaintiffs allege that they \nare individuals with disabilities entitled to protection under the ADA and the RA.  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 29, 30, 31, 119, 127.)  According to Plaintiffs, they are presently receiving \nDisability Waiver services in settings that segregate them from their communities.  (Id. \n¶¶ 2, 29(k), 30(f), 31(e).  Plaintiffs allege that alternative Disability Waiver services exist \n“that help individuals transition from less integrated settings into homes of their own.”  \n(Id. ¶¶ 84-85.)  However, Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants fail to ensure individuals \nhave notice of, information regarding, or access to these services.”  (Id. ¶ 85.)  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs allege that, “[r]ather than require statewide access to \nindividualized housing services, Defendants provide impermissible discretion to each \nlead agency to choose whether to offer individualized housing services.”  (Id. ¶ 27.)  As a \nresult, Plaintiffs assert, Disability Waiver recipients are prevented “from receiving an \ninformed choice and opportunity to live in the most integrated setting.”  (Id.)  In light of \nthese allegations and considering the Complaint as a whole, Plaintiffs plausibly assert \nviable integration mandate claims against Defendants in this case.  \nFinally, the Court considers the requirement that individuals with disabilities \nrequest only “reasonable modifications” and the affirmative defense available to states \nthat “the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or \nactivity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  These regulatory provisions underlie the Supreme \n53 \n \n\nCourt’s assertion in Olmstead that “[t]he State’s responsibility, once it provides \ncommunity-based treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is not boundless” and \nthe Supreme Court’s requirement that the requested placements “can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of \nothers with mental disabilities.”  527 U.S. at 603, 607.   \nAt this stage, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that they \nhave requested only reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the \nstate’s Disability Waiver services programs.  Importantly, Plaintiffs identify examples of \nthe specific services they seek to transition to more integrated settings, and they allege \nthat these services are already available under the Disability Waivers.  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 10, 84.)  Plaintiffs also assert that “Defendants currently approve some limited \nindividualized alternatives for a small number of Disability Waiver recipients.”  (Id. \n¶ 67.)  Plaintiffs also note that Defendants previously “identified some specific \nindividualized housing services, such as Individualized Housing Options (‘IHO’), as \nassistance to help people move into and remain in the most integrated setting” in draft \nversions of the state’s Olmstead Plan.  (Id. ¶ 60.)  In addition, Plaintiffs point out that \nDefendants have already committed in the Olmstead Plan to moving 5,547 individuals \ninto more integrated settings.  (Id. ¶ 62.)  In short, they allege that “Plaintiffs are capable \nof and want to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and Defendant \nPiper can reasonably accommodate their requests.”  (Id. ¶ 121.)   \nThe Court acknowledges that this case presents a closer question on the reasonable \nmodification inquiry than Guggenberger.  See 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1030.  Along with \n54 \n \n\nseeking access to existing services, Plaintiffs also note a “shortage of individualized \nhousing providers” and appear to potentially seek an increase in the actual capacity of \nproviders available.  (Id. ¶¶ 90-91.)  Whether such a modification would be a reasonable \nmodification and an appropriate remedy to Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claim will \nrequire careful scrutiny as this case proceeds.  At this stage, however, the Court declines \nto dismiss Plaintiffs’ integration mandate claims on this basis. \nFurther, as the Court concluded in Guggenberger, it would be premature to resolve \nDefendants’ fundamental alteration defense in their favor at the pleading stage.  See \nGuggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1030-31 (“Given Plaintiffs’ allegations and the \ncomplexity of the issues involved in Defendants’ administration of a statewide Waiver \nServices program, determining whether Plaintiffs’ request would constitute a \nfundamental alternation of Defendants’ programs is a fact-specific inquiry that the Court \ncannot presently resolve in Defendants’ favor.”); see also id. (collecting cases to support \nthis conclusion).   \nThe Court concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged integration mandate \nclaims under both the ADA and the RA, and the Court denies Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss these claims.8 \n                                                           \n8   Defendants cite caselaw to suggest that the ADA does not require the provision of \nparticular services or a certain level of services to be provided.  (See Doc. No.12 at 23-24 \n(citing Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 81-82 (2d Cir. 1998); M.K. ex rel. Mrs. K. v. Sergi, \n554 F. Supp. 2d 175, 198 (D. Conn. 2008)).)  The Court does not find these cases to be \npersuasive.  Pfrommer did not involve an integration mandate claim, and the court noted \nthat “plaintiff is in essence challenging the adequacy of his [Vocational Educational \nServices for Individuals with Disabilities] services, not illegal disability discrimination.”  \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page) \n55 \n \n\nIV.  Federalism and Separation of Powers \nAlong with challenging the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ claims, Defendants argue that \nPlaintiffs’ complaint seeks relief which is barred by principles of federalism and the \nseparation of powers.  According to Defendants, imposing the relief Plaintiffs seek would \ndeprive the state legislature of its discretion to allocation scarce funding resources.  \nDefendants also argue that the Plaintiffs seek relief which would deprive Defendants of \ndiscretion to administer resources according to its treatment and case management \nprofessionals’ expertise.  In addition, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs seek relief which \nwould require the Court to improperly oversee the day-to-day workings of the State’s \nDisability Waiver programs.  According to Defendants, “Plaintiffs appear to suggest a \nwholesale, Court-supervised redesign of Minnesota’s disability waiver services and \nhousing system.”  (Doc. No. 12 at 28.)  Defendants direct the Court to evaluate Plaintiffs’ \nactual Amended Complaint because Plaintiffs’ briefing ignores what they really seek.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(Footnote Continued From Previous Page) \nSee 148 F.3d at 82.  Although M.K. involved the integration mandate, the court followed \nPfrommer and explained that “plaintiffs here are attempting to invoke the \nanti-discrimination provisions of the ADA and the [RA] to challenge the adequacy of the \nservices provided by [the state agency], not illegal disability discrimination.”  See \n554 F. Supp. 2d at 198. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs are challenging illegal discrimination based on the state’s \nalleged failure to ensure they are served in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \nneeds.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597 (“Unjustified isolation, we hold, is properly \nregarded as discrimination based on disability.”).  Although states are not required to \n“provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities” under Olmstead, they \n“must adhere to the ADA’s nondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services \nthey in fact provide.”  See id. at 603 n.14.  In light of Plaintiffs’ allegations that they are \nbeing unduly segregated based on Defendants’ administration of the state’s Disability \nWaiver programs, the Court finds Pfrommer and M.K. to be distinguishable and \nunpersuasive with respect to this case.   \n56 \n \n\nAccording to Defendants, the Amended Complaint describes in detail the \nmicromanagement of the State’s Disability Waiver services program that Plaintiffs seek.  \nIn short, Defendants argue, Plaintiffs request unlimited services and an unlimited funding \nmandate which a federal Court cannot order.  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, federal courts may properly order and oversee the \nadministration of state programs as long as they do not dictate the precise course a state \nshould follow and leave it the state to develop the program.  Plaintiffs argue that the \nCourt can properly order that the state provide the Disability Waiver services deemed \nrequired under federal law.  Plaintiffs point out that principles of federalism and the \nseparation of powers are meant to protect individual liberty not to benefit state \ngovernments.  Plaintiffs argue that they properly ask the Court to hold Defendants \naccountable by requiring them to administer their state program as required by federal \nlaw.  Contrary to Defendants’ arguments, Plaintiffs contend that they are not asking the \nCourt to micromanage or oversee the day-to-day operation of the state’s Disability \nWaiver services program.   \nIn Olmstead, the Supreme Court emphasized that states do not have “boundless” \nobligations to provide community-based treatment to individuals with disabilities.  527 \nU.S. at 603.  Courts must ensure that they give sufficient “leeway” to states seeking “[t]o \nmaintain a range of facilities and to administer services with an even hand.”  Id. at 605.  \nIndeed, there are certain “federalism costs inherent in referring state decisions regarding \nthe administration of treatment programs and the allocation of resources to the reviewing \nauthority of the federal courts.”  Id. at 610 (Kennedy, J., concurring).   \n57 \n \n\nThe Supreme Court has also explained that “[f]ederalism concerns are heightened \nwhen . . . a federal court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.”  \nHorne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 448 (2009).  In crafting appropriate relief, courts must \n“give adequate consideration to the views of state . . . authorities” and “refrain[] from \ndictat[ing] precisely what course the State should follow.”  Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, \n362 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Notwithstanding these \nimportant limitations, however, “federal courts must vigilantly enforce federal law and \nmust not hesitate in awarding necessary relief.”  Horne, 557 U.S. at 450.   \nAs previously described, in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek declaratory \nrelief and injunctive relief directing Defendants to:  (1) “[p]romptly ensure every \nDisability Waiver recipient living in a CRS facility receives notice about eligibility for \nand access to individualized housing services, including person-centered planning;” \n(2) “[s]pecifically provide access and take prompt steps to make individualized housing \nservices, including person-centered planning, available to Plaintiffs in a reasonable \namount of time . . .”; and (3) “[t]ake such other steps as necessary to enable Plaintiffs to \nreceive residential services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs . . . .”  \n(Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4.)  These three requests directly parallel Plaintiffs’ claims \nrelating to Defendants’ alleged due process violations, violations of the Medicaid Act’s \nreasonable promptness requirement, and integration mandate violations under the ADA \nand the RA. \n58 \n \n\nIn challenging Plaintiffs’ requested relief, Defendants primarily take issue with the \ndetailed proposed relief Plaintiffs identify under items (2) and (3).  For example, under \nitem (2), Plaintiffs seek: \nAccess to person-centered planning services that ensure an individual \nreceives a comprehensive personal transition plan with enforceable \ntimelines, identifiable tasks, persons responsible for such tasks, descriptions \nof the integrated housing options from which to choose, and any other \ninformation necessary to facilitate a transition and subsequent life in the \nmost integrated setting.  \n \n(Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4(b).)  Under item (3), Plaintiffs identify the steps they request \nthe Court to order, “including, but not limited to” a list of multiple proposed \nmodifications to the state’s residential service system.9  (Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4(c).)  \n                                                           \n9   Specifically, the Amended Complaint identifies the following requested steps: \n \ni.  Administering and operating their residential service system in a manner which \nactively promotes individualized housing services; \nii.  Modifying their residential service system, making such changes as approved \nby the Court, that describe each of the activities that must be undertaken to \npermit timely access to available individualized housing services, including but \nnot limited to: \nA.  Changes to benefit programs that ensure an individual has adequate \nnotice of, access to, and support to enable a proper transition into the \nmost integrated setting for which they are eligible; \nB.  Changes to applicable service definitions and regulations; \nC.  Changes to policies and procedures and lead agency requirements \nregarding person-centered transition planning;  \nD.  Statewide planning related to the implementation of person-centered \ntransition plans; \nE.  Statewide planning and training, including the proper development of \ndirect service professionals, case managers, and lead agency staff to \nprovide individualized housing services and to support service \nrecipients in the most integrated setting; \nF.  Family and self-advocacy education regarding housing options for \nindividuals;  \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page) \n59 \n \n\nThe Court acknowledges that the requested relief Plaintiffs identify is both detailed and \nbroad.  However, the Court declines to conclude at this early stage that any such relief is \ncategorically precluded by federalism or separation of powers concerns.   \nFirst, the Plaintiffs do not appear to be seeking to improperly dictate local funding \npriorities or direct the state’s allocation of funds.  Plaintiffs allege that the services they \nseek are offered under the Disability Waivers, and they seek access to those services in a \nreasonably prompt amount of time so that they can transition to the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs.  To the extent Plaintiffs seek the creation of new \nservices or residential settings or the allocation of additional state funding, the Court can \nevaluate the propriety of such requests as this case proceeds.   \nSecond, at this stage, the Court does not construe the requested relief to require an \nunwarranted intrusion into state agency affairs.  As the Court determined in declining to \ndismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint in response to Defendants’ fundamental \nalteration defense, the Court again concludes that dismissal based on concerns over the \nscope of Plaintiffs’ requested relief would be premature.   \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(Footnote Continued From Previous Page) \nG.

Compl. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4(c).) \n60 \n \n\nIf the Court determines that Defendants are liable for the claims Plaintiffs have \nplausibly alleged in their Amended Complaint, the relief the Court ultimately imposes \ncan be properly tailored in light of constitutional limitations at a later stage.  Importantly, \nsuch relief can also be crafted based on recommendations from the state itself.  The Court \nis aware of the important limitations on its authority imposed by federalism and \nseparation of powers principles.  However, the Court concludes that these limitations do \nnot require dismissal of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. \nV.  Necessary Parties \nDefendants make two arguments relating to the proper parties in this case.  First, \nDefendants argue that the lead agencies (Minnesota tribes and counties) are necessary \nparties because they administer Disability Waivers and implement person-centered \nplanning practices in the State.  Because lead agencies are responsible for developing \nindividuals’ service plans, Defendants argue, the Court could not afford the relief the \nPlaintiffs seek in their absence.  Second, Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss \nDHS as a party because the claims against DHS are redundant of the claims against \nCommissioner Johnson Piper in her official capacity. \nPlaintiffs argue that the lead agencies are not necessary parties because the Court \ncould provide meaningful relief to Plaintiffs in their absence and Defendants have \nultimate responsibility for the Disability Waiver programs throughout the State.  \nPlaintiffs do not oppose dismissal of DHS as a party in light of the claims against \nCommissioner Johnson Piper in her official capacity. \n61 \n \n\nDefendants’ arguments with respect to lead agencies are substantially similar to \nthose presented in Guggenberger.  As a result, the Court concludes that Minnesota \ncounties and tribes are not necessary parties in accordance with its analysis and holdings \nin Guggenberger, which it adopts herein.  See Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1033-\n35.  Notwithstanding the individual counties’ role in coordinating the provision of \nDisability Waiver services, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that Defendants have oversight \nresponsibilities and authority such that the Court can afford complete relief in the \ncounties’ absence.  Further, Defendants have not established that the counties have any \ninterest in this litigation which would be practically impeded or impaired through their \nabsence.   \nThe Court also adopts its reasoning in Guggenberger regarding the duplicative RA \nclaims against DHS and Commissioner Johnson Piper in her official capacity.  See id. at \n1003-04 & n.12.  Thus, the Court shall dismiss DHS as a party to this lawsuit.  For all \npractical purposes, the claims against Commissioner Johnson Piper shall be treated as \nclaims against the state agency itself, and allegations in the Amended Complaint directed \nat either DHS or Commissioner Johnson Piper shall be deemed interchangeable.  See id. \nat 1004 n.12. \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to assert their claims based on \nbeing denied particular Disability Waiver services and being segregated from their \ncommunities.  Plaintiffs’ claim for denial of reasonably prompt provision of services \nunder the Medicaid Act is also ripe for review.  Further, the Court concludes that \n62 \n \n\nPlaintiffs have plausibly alleged claims for violations of the Medicaid Act’s reasonable \npromptness requirement, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); due process requirements under the \nFourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3); Title II of the \nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; and § 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).   \nIn light of the relief Plaintiffs seek to remedy Defendants’ alleged violations of \nlaw, the Court declines to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint based on federalism or \nseparation of powers principles.  Finally, Minnesota tribes and counties are not necessary \nparties because the Court can order meaningful relief in an action solely against \nCommissioner Johnson Piper.  However, the Court shall dismiss DHS as a party and \ngrants Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on this basis.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \notherwise denied. \nORDER \n  Based on the files, record, and proceedings herein, and for the reasons stated \nabove, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. [10]) is GRANTED IN PART \nand DENIED IN PART as follows: \na.  The motion is GRANTED to the extent it seeks dismissal of \nthe Minnesota Department of Human Services as a party.  The Minnesota \nDepartment of Human Services is thus DISMISSED as a party to this \naction. \nb.  The motion is DENIED in all other respects. \n63 \n \n\n2.  The Minnesota Department of Human Services is DISMISSED as a party \nto this action.  All claims against Commissioner Johnson Piper, Commissioner of the \nMinnesota Department of Human Services, in her official capacity shall proceed. \n \nDated:  May 18, 2017      s/Donovan W.

(Doc.  No.  10.)  For  the \nsupport standing;  reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and \n   denies in part the motion. \nrecipients established causation to support standing;    \n    \nrecipients  established  redressability  requirement  for \nstanding; \nBACKGROUND \n  \nrecipients’ reasonable promptness claim under Medicaid \nThis case relates to an alleged denial of services under \nAct was ripe for review; \nMinnesota’s  Medicaid  Disability  Waivers  and  the \n  \nresulting  isolation and  segregation  of  individuals  with \nrecipients stated reasonable promptness claim; and \ndisabilities  who  seek  greater  integration  into  their \n  \ncommunities. This case has been designated as related to \nrecipients stated procedural due process claim. \nJensen v. Minnesota Department of Human Services, Civ. \n  1 \n \n\n \nNo.  09–1775  (D.  Minn.).

(See Order, Mikkelson v. Johnson Piper, Civ. No.  According to Plaintiffs, as of July 2016, nearly 13,800 \n15–3439 (D. Minn. Aug. 31, 2015), Doc. No. 4.)

The Court will analyze the allegations and  Waivers that would permit individuals to achieve greater \narguments specific to this case below, but also directs  integration in the community. (Id. ¶ 7; see also id. ¶¶ \nreaders to Guggenberger for additional background on the  80–83.) According to Plaintiffs, “individualized housing \nrelevant law underlying Plaintiffs’ claims.  uses  Disability  Waiver  services,  including \n   person-centered  planning,  to  design  and  implement  a \n  customized setting for the individual to live, work, and \n  enjoy leisure time in the most integrated setting.” (Id. ¶ \n7.) Plaintiffs identify examples of services offered under \nDisability Waivers “that help individuals transition from \nI. Minnesota’s Residential Service System Under  less integrated settings into homes of their own.” (Id. ¶ \nMedicaid Disability Waivers  84.) For example, Plaintiffs identify Consumer Training \nMinnesota participates in the federal Medicaid program, a  and  Education  and  Family  Training  and  Counseling \njointly-operated federal and state program that provides  “which allows individuals to hire trained person-centered \n“healthcare  and  related  services”  to  individuals  with \nplanners to help develop self-advocacy skills and create \ndisabilities.

(Doc. No. 1.) On September 14, 2016, Defendants filed the \n  Motion to Dismiss presently pending before the Court. (Doc. No. 10.) On January 20, 2017, the Court held a hearing \non Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. No. 29.) On February 17, 2017, the parties filed a Stipulation permitting \nPlaintiffs to file an Amended Complaint. (See Doc. No. 31.) Pursuant to Magistrate Judge Becky R. Thorson’s \nFebruary 22, 2017 Order Granting Plaintiffs Leave to File Amended Complaint, “Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint (Doc. No. 10) ... serves as Defendants’ response to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint.” (Doc. \n  21 \n \n\n \nNo. 32.) On February 23, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint. (Doc. No. 33 (“Am. Compl.”).) \n \n2  In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to four separate waiver programs collectively as “Disability Waivers.” \n  (Id. ¶ 24.) These programs include the Developmental Disabilities Waiver, the Community Access for Disability \nInclusion Waiver, the Community Alternative Care Waiver, and the Brain Injury Waiver. (Id.) \n \n3  The Court reaches this conclusion with respect to all named Plaintiffs, notwithstanding the fact that Bottelson \n  alleges receiving some person-centered-planning services in the past. (See id. ¶ 30(k).) According to the Complaint, \nBottelson has nonetheless “not received all the necessary individualized housing services to help her find or develop \nalternatives to her current CRS facility.” (Id.) Thus, the Court concludes that Bottelson has standing to challenge \nDefendants’ failure to ensure she has received all such services. \n \n4  The Court also concludes that the transition period to come into compliance with new federal regulations relating to \n  Disability Waiver services does not require dismissal of Plaintiffs’ reasonable promptness claim. Defendants appear \nto be raising the CMS Regulations and the corresponding transition period as a defense to Plaintiffs’ reasonable \npromptness claim. While such a defense may impact the Court’s ultimate analysis of Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court \nconcludes this argument is premature. Cf. Wagner v. Dept. of Health Servs., 2013 WL 3776327, at *7 (W.D. Wis. July \n17, 2013) (“At best, this argument is premature. At this stage, defendants cannot seek to dismiss the complaint for \nfailure to state a claim by invoking the specter of arguments that they may later raise in defense or, at least, on a \nmore complete record.”). \n \n5  Defendants also assert that if Plaintiffs are seeking funding to live wherever they want, such relief would violate \n  Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. The Court does not construe Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint to seek such \nrelief and therefore need not reach this argument. \n \n6  Defendants appear to question the Court’s reliance in Guggenberger on the Seventh Circuit’s recent decision in \n  Steimel v. Wernert, 823 F.3d 902, 910–14 (7th Cir. 2016), because the plaintiffs in Steimel alleged that they faced a \nrisk of institutionalization. To the extent Guggenberger suggests otherwise, the Court acknowledges that the Steimel \nplaintiffs made such allegations. However, the Seventh Circuit’s holding in Steimel indicates that it would have \nrecognized a viable Olmstead claim even in the absence of these allegations. In particular, the Seventh Circuit \nexplained, “the integration mandate is implicated where the state’s policies have either (1) segregated persons with \ndisabilities in their own homes, or (2) put them at serious risk of institutionalization.” Id. at 914. It also determined \nthat the integration mandate “bars unjustified segregation of persons with disabilities, wherever it takes place.” Id. \nat 911; see also Guggenberger, 198 F.Supp.3d at 1028 (discussing Steimel and identifying these holdings). The Court \nonce again concludes that Steimel supports a broad application of the integration mandate even where no risk of \ninstitutionalization is alleged. \n \n7  To be sure, the views of the state’s treatment professionals will ultimately be relevant to determine whether \n  Plaintiffs can appropriately be treated in more integrated settings as they allege. As noted in Justice Kennedy’s \nconcurring opinion in Olmstead, “it would be a tragic event ... were the [ADA] to be interpreted so that States had \nsome incentive, for fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care \nand into settings with too little assistance and supervision.” 527 U.S. at 610, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (Kennedy, J., concurring). \n  22 \n \n\n \nAs a result, “[t]he opinion of a responsible treating physician in determining the appropriate conditions for \ntreatment ought to be given the greatest of deference.” Id. Where a plaintiff’s integration mandate claim is based in \npart on the failure to be assessed, however, it would be unreasonable to dismiss such a claim for failure to allege \nfacts relating to the (nonexistent) determinations of the state’s treatment professionals. \n \n8  Defendants cite caselaw to suggest that the ADA does not require the provision of particular services or a certain \n  level of services to be provided. (See Doc. No.12 at 23–24 (citing Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 81–82 (2d Cir. 1998); \nM.K. ex rel. Mrs. K. v. Sergi, 554 F.Supp.2d 175, 198 (D. Conn. 2008)).) The Court does not find these cases to be \npersuasive. Pfrommer did not involve an integration mandate claim, and the court noted that “plaintiff is in essence \nchallenging the adequacy of his [Vocational Educational Services for Individuals with Disabilities] services, not illegal \ndisability discrimination.” See 148 F.3d at 82. Although M.K. involved the integration mandate, the court followed \nPfrommer and explained that “plaintiffs here are attempting to invoke the anti-discrimination provisions of the ADA \nand the [RA] to challenge the adequacy of the services provided by [the state agency], not illegal disability \ndiscrimination.” See 554 F.Supp.2d at 198. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs are challenging illegal discrimination based on the state’s alleged failure to ensure they are \nserved in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597, 119 S.Ct. 2176 \n(“Unjustified isolation, we hold, is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.”). Although states are not \nrequired to “provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities” under Olmstead, they “must adhere to \nthe ADA’s nondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services they in fact provide.” See id. at 603 n.14. In \nlight of Plaintiffs’ allegations that they are being unduly segregated based on Defendants’ administration of the \nstate’s Disability Waiver programs, the Court finds Pfrommer and M.K. to be distinguishable and unpersuasive with \nrespect to this case. \n \n9  Specifically, the Amended Complaint identifies the following requested steps: \n \ni.  Administering  and  operating  their  residential  service  system  in  a  manner  which  actively  promotes \nindividualized housing services; \nii. Modifying their residential service system, making such changes as approved by the Court, that describe \neach of the activities that must be undertaken to permit timely access to available individualized housing \nservices, including but not limited to: \nA. Changes to benefit programs that ensure an individual has adequate notice of, access to, and support to \nenable a proper transition into the most integrated setting for which they are eligible; \nB. Changes to applicable service definitions and regulations; \nC. Changes to policies and procedures and lead agency requirements regarding person-centered transition \nplanning; \nD. Statewide planning related to the implementation of person-centered transition plans; \nE. Statewide planning and training, including the proper development of direct service professionals, case \nmanagers, and lead agency staff to provide individualized housing services and to support service recipients \nin the most integrated setting; \nF.

Infrastructure modifications such as changes to the statewide individualized housing networking process; \n  23 \n \n\n \nand \nH. Planning and interagency coordination to ensure that integrated alternatives to CRS facilities are available \nto those who want to live in the most integrated setting. \niii.

Specifically, choosing where to live – a \nchoice most of us take for granted. But Plaintiffs, who are individuals with disabilities, \nhave been denied this most basic choice. The Minnesota Department of Human Services \n(“DHS”) has promised for many years to “help[] people move to more integrated settings, \nhomes that they choose,” (DHS Advertisement, ACCESS PRESS, September, 2015) but it \nhas failed to give Plaintiffs and hundreds of similarly situated individuals the opportunity \nto meet that goal. Defendants established and maintain a discriminatory residential \nservice system that funnels individuals with disabilities into segregated housing while \nrestricting their ability to move to more integrated settings of their own choice. \n1503-0404974-1681073.docx \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 2 of 39\nPlaintiffs in this class action lawsuit are individuals with disabilities who want to \nbe integrated into their communities, like people without disabilities, but have been \ndenied the opportunity due to the actions and inactions of Defendants. The Class consists \nof individuals who are receiving a Medicaid Home and Community Based Disability \nWaiver (“Disability Waiver”) and are living in a Community Residential Setting (“CRS”) \nfacility, but want to live elsewhere and be integrated into their community. Instead, \nDefendants have needlessly segregated the Individual Plaintiffs and Class Members \n(collectively referred to as the “Plaintiffs”) away from their family, friends, and the \ncommunities in which they wish to live.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n1.  Plaintiffs have various disabilities, including but not limited to \ndevelopmental, physical, and mental health disabilities, as well as brain injuries.   \n2.  Each Plaintiff receives a Disability Waiver to pay for services. The main \npurposes of the Disability Waiver are to enable Plaintiffs to interact with the larger \nnondisabled community and to allow them to live where they want and with whom they \nwant. \n3.  Defendants’ management of the Disability Waivers has failed to achieve \nthese purposes. Instead, Defendants have created, maintained, and over-relied on a \nresidential service system that limits individual autonomy, choice, and integration. This \nsystem violates the integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”) which requires Defendants to “administer services, programs, and activities in \n2 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 3 of 39\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n4.  Defendants’ overreliance on services provided in CRS facilities results in \nthe segregation of Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs demand that Defendants offer an informed choice \nand realistic opportunity to receive residential services in the most integrated setting. \n5.  Defendant DHS defines segregated settings as “congregate settings \npopulated exclusively or primarily with individuals with disabilities . . . [and] \ncharacterized by regimentation in daily activities [and] limits on individuals’ ability to \nengage freely in community activities.” Minnesota Olmstead Plan: Demographic \nAnalysis, Segregated Settings Counts, Targets and Timelines, September 20, 2014, p. 8. \n6.  Many of Defendants’ sanctioned CRS facilities are segregated settings \nbecause Plaintiffs are limited in who they can live and associate with. They are also \nlimited in where and how they spend their leisure time, how their days are structured, and \nwhat opportunities they are given to interact with people outside the CRS facility. CRS \nfacilities contain up to five persons, all with disabilities, living in a residence that is \nowned, leased, operated, and/or controlled by the same organization that provides the \nservices. Consequently, Defendants do not provide Plaintiffs with adequate individual \nchoices necessary to allow them to live in the most integrated setting. \n7.  In contrast to the CRS model, individualized housing uses Disability \nWaiver services, including person-centered planning, to design and implement a \ncustomized setting for the individual to live, work, and enjoy leisure time in the most \nintegrated setting. \n3 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 4 of 39\n8.  Person-centered planning is “an organized process of discovery and action \nmeant to improve a person’s quality of life . . . [designed to ensure people] the right and \nopportunity to . . . develop and maintain relationships; make choices about their daily \nlives; and achieve their personal goals.” Minnesota Olmstead Plan, August 10, 2015 \np. 33. \n9.  Person-centered planning, when facilitated by a trained person-centered \nplanner, enables individuals to develop comprehensive individualized transition plans.   \n10.  As part of their Disability Waiver services, Plaintiffs are entitled to hire a \ntrained person-centered planner. Plaintiffs need such services in order to develop a \ncomprehensive individualized transition plan to move to more integrated housing.  \n11.  Defendants’ actions and inactions have denied Plaintiffs the opportunity to \nfind trained person-centered planners, to receive services from a person-centered planner \nin a timely fashion, or to receive any such services in order to develop and implement \ncomprehensive individualized transition plans. \n12.  Even if Plaintiffs are eventually enabled to develop comprehensive \nindividualized transition plans, Defendants’ failure to reasonably modify their residential \nservice system prevents Plaintiffs from implementing their transition plans and living in \nthe most integrated setting. \n13.  Although Plaintiffs are capable of living in a more integrated setting, \nDefendants’ administration, operation, and oversight (or lack thereof) has led to a \npervasive overreliance on segregated CRS facilities. Defendants discriminate against \nPlaintiffs by failing to provide integrated individualized housing services that would \n4 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 5 of 39\nenable them to have the choice and realistic opportunity to live in the most integrated \nsetting. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, as enforced by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983; Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 and 12131 et seq., and implementing \nregulations; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and implementing regulations; \nand the Medicaid Act 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a et seq., and implementing regulations, as \nenforced by 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n15.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction over the claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, and has original jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1343(a)(3) and (4). \n16.  Venue is proper in the District of Minnesota pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1391(b), as the conduct alleged is occurring in this District. \nTHE PARTIES \nThe Individual Plaintiffs \n17.  Jenna Gordon is a 24-year-old resident of Dakota County, Minnesota. \n18.  Marvin and Debra Gordon are the parents and legal guardians of Jenna \nGordon.  Marvin is a resident of Wright County, Minnesota, and Debra is a resident of \nHennepin County, Minnesota.   \n19.  Tenner Murphy is a 32-year-old resident of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \n5 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 6 of 39\n20.  Kay and Richard Murphy are the parents and legal guardians of Tenner \nMurphy and are residents of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \n21.  Marrie Bottelson is a 41-year-old resident of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \n22.  Dionne Swanson is a 43-year old resident of Hennepin County, Minnesota. \nThe Defendants \n23.  Defendant DHS is the statewide agency charged with overseeing and \nsetting policies for Minnesota’s Medicaid programs. This includes the Disability Waivers \nand residential services for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities, \ntraumatic brain injury, mental illness, and other disabilities. \n24.  DHS is a public entity subject to Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. DHS receives federal funds for the administration of its programs. \n25.  Defendant Emily Johnson Piper is the Commissioner of DHS. She is \nresponsible for administering and managing the Disability Waiver programs. She also \noversees the licensing and monitoring of residential services providers, including those \nthat own and operate CRS facilities. Defendant Piper is sued in her official capacity. \nSTATEMENTS OF FACT \n26.  Defendants administer four community service waiver programs for \npersons with disabilities: the Developmental Disabilities (“DD”) Waiver, the Community \nAccess for Disability Inclusion (“CADI”) Waiver, the Community Alternative Care \n(“CAC”) Waiver, and the Brain Injury (“BI”) Waiver (collectively referred to as the \n“Disability Waivers”). Defendants submit these Disability Waivers to the Federal \n6 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 7 of 39\nGovernment and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) approves \nthem.   \n27.  The Disability Waivers are funded by federal and state dollars, pursuant to \nSection 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. These Disability Waivers allow Defendants to \nprovide a variety of services with Medicaid funding, such as residential support services, \nwithout having to meet certain Medicaid statutory requirements. The Disability Waivers \ncan fund a variety of residential services, including individualized housing services.  \nServices under the Disability Waivers are public programs, services, and activities \ncovered by Title II of the ADA. \n28.  Defendants manage Disability Waiver services in a manner that \ndisproportionately provides residential services in segregated, rather than individualized \nand integrated, settings.  \n29.  Defendants direct and manage counties, which serve as lead agencies, for \npurposes of administering many health and social services programs, including Disability \nWaiver services. Rather than require statewide access to individualized housing services, \nDefendants provide impermissible discretion to each lead agency to choose whether to \noffer individualized housing services. Most counties do not offer individualized housing \nservices. This abdication of DHS’s responsibility to provide and ensure choice prevents \nindividuals receiving Disability Waiver services from receiving an informed choice and \nopportunity to live in the most integrated setting. \n30.  Defendants have failed to inform all persons receiving a Disability Waiver \nof individualized housing service options and have failed to explain how to access such \n7 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 8 of 39\nservices. Defendants have also failed to provide transition planning and support for such \nservices. Defendants have further failed to provide notices of denial or information \nregarding due process rights in regards to requests for these services. \n31.  Plaintiff Jenna Gordon has various developmental disabilities, including \nCoffin Siris Syndrome and Dandy Walker Syndrome that impede her cognitive \nfunctioning. \na.  Over the past six years, Ms. Gordon has lived in four different CRS \nfacilities. None of them have allowed her to live the most integrated life \npossible. \nb.  A common pattern for Ms. Gordon is a brief “honeymoon” period upon \nmoving into a CRS facility, but then a realization that living with three \nother people with disabilities creates unnecessary conflicts. In February \n2016, her former CRS facility kicked her out, and she was forced to move \nto a CRS facility specifically designed to serve people in crisis. \nc.  Neither Ms. Gordon nor her guardians consider her to be in crisis. She has \nsimply not been able to find a setting and services customized to her needs.   \nd.  Specifically, Ms. Gordon prefers her own personal space and the ability to \nbe alone. She wants her own small apartment so that she can clean and \norganize things just the way she likes them. \ne.  While she is not opposed to having roommates, she wants individualized \nhousing services so she can choose who she lives with and have control in \n8 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 9 of 39\nthe hiring and management of staff. The consistency of staffing is very \nimportant to Ms. Gordon’s ability to integrate into the community. \nf.  Ms. Gordon would also like to have more access to the community on a \nmore regular basis. Because of staffing patterns in her various CRS \nfacilities, she has had a very limited ability to engage and interact in public. \ng.  Ms. Gordon and her guardians have requested, but have not received, a \nperson-centered planner and other individualized housing services to enable \nher to plan for and transition into a more integrated setting.  \nh.  Since she was evicted from her previous CRS facility in February, 2016, \nher guardians have been asking providers to consider serving her in a home \nof her own. They have not been given information regarding her due \nprocess rights in regards to this request for these services. To this point, it is \nunclear when, if ever, Ms. Gordon will be allowed to live in a more \nintegrated setting. \n32.  Plaintiff Tenner Murphy has severe physical and cognitive disabilities as a \nresult of a lifelong battle with degenerative brain cancer. \na.  Despite his condition, he graduated from high school envisioning living a \ntypical adult life pursuing relationships, a job, activities and interests, and \nhis own place to live. \nb.  As his disability progressed during his twenties, he stayed in his parents’ \nhome where his family acted as his primary caretakers. \n9 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 10 of 39\nc.  Mr. Murphy developed hobbies, such as archery, and had many \nnondisabled friends in the community. \nd.  In 2010, Mr. Murphy’s physical needs became more difficult to manage, \nand his parents made the difficult decision to look for an out-of-home \nplacement. \ne.  Mr. Murphy’s case manager at the time told Mr. Murphy and his family \nthat he could receive a Disability Waiver in order to move into a CRS \nfacility.   \nf.  When he moved into his CRS facility, Mr. Murphy was walking on a \nregular basis. But the CRS staff now make him use a wheelchair because \nthere is often not enough staff available or willing to assist him when he \nwants to walk. \ng.  On a typical day, Mr. Murphy spends most of his time alone, even though \nhe would prefer to interact with other people. He will often spend several \nhours sitting on the deck, the porch, or the dining room table by himself.   \nh.  Because of distance and staffing patterns at the CRS facility, he rarely goes \nto the archery range. He no longer follows his favorite television news \nprograms because his preferred shows are broadcast at a time when house \nrules prohibit television watching. \ni.  Mr. Murphy has no control about how staff members are hired or trained \nand has no control of what housemates are moved into the facility. \n10 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 11 of 39\nj.  The other residents in the CRS facility have difficulty communicating and \nMr. Murphy rarely speaks or interacts with them. Because he enjoys \nmeeting new people and conversing with others, Mr. Murphy wants to be \nable to choose his own roommates.   \nk.  Although Kay Murphy, Mr. Murphy’s mother and legal guardian, has asked \nseveral people at the lead agency about accessing more individualized \nhousing options, Mr. Murphy remains stuck in a segregated setting, where \nhis interactions are largely limited to other persons with disabilities and \npaid staff.  \nl.  Despite receiving no information from Defendants about Mr. Murphy’s \nright to live in his own home, Mr. Murphy’s family recently purchased a \nnew housing unit, with the hopes of having Mr. Murphy move into it with \nroommates of his choosing.   \nm. Despite this positive advancement, Mr. Murphy is still stuck in the CRS \nfacility because of Defendants’ failure to provide an informed choice of \nintegrated alternatives. They have prevented Mr. Murphy from choosing \nindividualized housing services, such as a live-in caregiver that he can hire \nand train to help him more fully interact with his community and be as \nintegrated as possible. \nn.  Mr. Murphy has not received a notice of denial or information regarding his \ndue process rights in regards to his request for these services. \n11 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 12 of 39\n33.  Plaintiff Marrie Bottelson has cerebral palsy and other developmental \ndisabilities.  \na.  She uses a motorized wheelchair and needs personal assistance in order to \ndo basic daily tasks, such as getting dressed and eating.  \nb.  Despite her disabilities, she is a successful artist and a valued member of \nthe arts community in Minnesota. She is also her own guardian and prides \nherself in making independent decisions about her life.  \nc.  She has lived in a CRS facility for about thirteen years.  \nd.  For the past several years, she has asked the different case managers she \nhas had to help her move into her own apartment with her current \nroommate and best friend, Dionne Swanson. Her case managers and county \nworkers, however, have told Ms. Bottelson that there are no other options \nfor her. \ne.  Because of staffing patterns in the facility, Ms. Bottelson is forced to go to \nbed at 7 or 8 p.m. because there is no other way for her to receive necessary \ncare. \nf.  Staffing patterns also dictate how much time Ms. Bottelson can spend in \nthe community. Because of this, her interaction with the community is \nseverely limited, and she does not get out into the community nearly as \nmuch as she would if she were able to create her own schedule.  \ng.  To be as independent as possible, Ms. Bottelson would like to hire her own \nstaff and live in her own apartment. One of her goals is to continue building \n12 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 13 of 39\nher art business, and she would like space in her own home to set up a \nsmall art studio to more easily work from home. \nh.  Ms. Bottelson would like to live with her best friend and current roommate, \nDionne Swanson. Together, they have often talked of finding an apartment \nor other small residence. She needs person-centered planning to help her \ndevelop an individualized moving plan and other individualized housing \nservices in order to make these goals a reality. \ni.  Ms. Bottelson’s previous case managers told her several times that \nindividualized housing is not a possibility for her, even though she lived in \nher own apartment for nearly ten years before moving into her current CRS.  \nj.  In 2013 Ms. Bottelson asked her previous case manager to help her find \nindividualized housing as an alternative to her CRS facility. She was told \nthat such housing was too hard to find, and has not been given alternative \noptions to consider.  \nk.  Although she recently met with a person-centered planner in July, 2016, \nshe has not received all the necessary individualized housing services to \nhelp her find or develop alternatives to her current CRS facility. \nl.  Ms. Bottelson has not received a notice of denial or information regarding \nher due process rights in regards to her request for these services. \n34.  Plaintiff Dionne Swanson has cerebral palsy and other developmental \ndisabilities.  \n13 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 14 of 39\na.  She uses a motorized wheelchair and needs personal assistance in order to \ndo basic daily tasks, such as getting dressed and eating. \nb.  Ms. Swanson is her own guardian and has developed many independent \nskills over the years. Still, Ms. Swanson’s case managers have told her she \nis not “independent enough” for individualized housing. Defendants, \nhowever, do not impose such criteria for individualized housing.  \nc.  As her own guardian, Ms. Swanson wants to make basic decisions other \nadults are able to make, such as choosing what time to go to bed. Instead, \nfor staff convenience, she is often forced to go to bed at 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. \nd.  Ms. Swanson has had difficulty getting group home staff to provide care \nthat respects her wishes. \ne.  Ms. Swanson needs person-centered planning services, and other \nindividualized housing services to help her create and execute a plan to live \nin the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs. \nf.  Despite asking for person-centered planning and other individualized \nhousing services for a long time, Ms. Swanson has not received them.  She \nhas never received a notice of denial or information regarding her due \nprocess rights in regards to her request for these services. \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \nSection 1983 Medicaid and Constitutional Claims \n35.  Medicaid is a healthcare and related services program jointly operated and \nfunded by the federal government and each participating state. Once a state chooses to \n14 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 15 of 39\nparticipate, it must operate its program in compliance with federal statutory and \nregulatory requirements. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a. The State of Minnesota has chosen to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program. \n36.  Minnesota’s Disability Waiver services are Medicaid services that provide \na comprehensive, cost-effective, home and community-based package of services for \nindividuals with disabilities, such as Plaintiffs. They allow individuals to receive services \noutside of institutional settings such as nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities \nfor persons with developmental disabilities.   \n37.  Disability Waiver services include a wide array of services and supports, \nsuch as direct care staffing, vocational skills and employment assistance, environmental \nmodifications and other assistive technology, transitional and housing assistance, and \nother services designed to help people with disabilities live in his or her own home and \ninteract with the larger nondisabled community. \n38.  Medicaid requires the provision of services with reasonable promptness. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) and 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(a). \n39.  42 U.S.C. § 1983 entitles Plaintiffs to enforce provisions of Defendant \nDHS’s Medicaid Act obligations, including 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8). \n40.  Constitutional Due Process requirements mandate that Defendants provide \nproper notice prior to adverse actions and access to fair hearings. Medicaid also requires \nthe provision of notice and due process requirements, including a fair hearing when \nservices are not provided with reasonable promptness. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 entitles Plaintiffs to enforce these requirements. \n15 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 16 of 39\n \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act \n41.  The ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The Rehabilitation Act similarly prohibits \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities by entities that receive federal financial \nassistance. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n42.  In 1990, Congress enacted the ADA “to provide a clear and comprehensive \nnational mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). Among the specific issues the ADA addresses are \nactions that prevent persons with disabilities from “fully participat[ing] in all aspects of \nsociety” and “relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other \nopportunities.” Id. §§ 12101(a)(1), (5). \n43.  In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “historically, society has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, \nsuch forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious \nand pervasive social problem.” Id. § 12101(a)(2). \n44.  Congress also found that “people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an \ninferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, \neconomically, and educationally; [and] the Nation’s proper goals regarding individuals \n16 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 17 of 39\nwith disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals.” Id. §§ 12101(a)(6), (7). \n45.  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by \npublic entities. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. A “public entity” is any state or local government and \nany department, agency, or other instrumentality of a state or local government, and \ncovers all services, programs, and activities provided or made available by public entities, \nincluding through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements. See id. §§ 12131(1), \n12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130. Accordingly, Title II’s coverage extends to the state of \nMinnesota, Defendants’ agencies, and Defendants’ residential service system and \nDisability Waiver programs. \n46.  Congress directed the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing \nTitle II of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12134. \n47.  The Title II regulations require public entities to “administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). This is known as the \nintegration mandate. The Rehabilitation Act contains a similar requirement. Id. § \n41.51(d). \n48.  The “most integrated setting” is one that “enables individuals with \ndisabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible . . . .” 28 \nC.F.R. § Pt. 35, App. A (2010). \n49.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), also prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. Section 504’s implementing regulations provide \n17 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 18 of 39\nthat recipients of federal funds “shall administer programs and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.” 28 C.F.R. § \n41.51(d). \nOlmstead v. L.C. \n50.  The Supreme Court has held that Title II prohibits the unjustified \nsegregation of individuals with disabilities. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999). \n51.  The Supreme Court’s holding in Olmstead affirmed that segregation of \ndisabled persons is inconsistent with the interest of community integration and impedes \ncertain daily activities to which they are entitled to participate: “First, institutional \nplacement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates \nunwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of \nparticipating in community life.” Id. at 600. “Second, confinement in an institution \nseverely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, \nsocial contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and \ncultural enrichment.” Id. at 601. \n52.  Under Olmstead, public entities are required to provide community-based \nservices when (a) such services are appropriate, (b) the affected persons do not oppose \ncommunity-based treatment, and (c) community-based services can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the entity and the needs of \nother persons with disabilities.  Id. at 607. \nHome and Community Based Services: Community Setting Rule \n18 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 19 of 39\n53.  In January 2014, the CMS published a final administrative rule defining a \ncommunity setting for the purposes of Home and Community Based Services (“HCBS”). \n42 CFR § 441.301(c). \n54.  In order to comply with the rule, all persons receiving a Disability Waiver \nin Minnesota must receive services in a setting that, among other things, is: “selected by \nthe individual from among options, including non-disability purposed housing; integrated \nin and supports full access to the greater community; optimizes autonomy and \nindependence in making life choices; facilitates choice regarding services and who \nprovides them.” 42 CFR § 441.301(c)(4). \n55.  This rule is intended to “ensure that the setting chosen by the individual is \nintegrated in, and supports full access of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS to the \ngreater community, including opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive \nintegrated settings, engage in community life, control personal resources, and receive \nservices in the community to the same degree of access as individuals not receiving \nMedicaid HCBS.” 42 CFR § 441.301(c)(2)(i). \nThe Minnesota Olmstead Plan \n56.  Pursuant to a 2011 Stipulated Class Action Settlement Agreement arising \nout of a lawsuit filed in Minnesota Federal District Court, the State of Minnesota and \nDefendant DHS agreed to develop and implement an Olmstead Plan. Defendants \nsubmitted their most recent draft on August 10, 2015. The Court approved the plan on \nSeptember 29, 2015. Corresponding “Work Plans” were approved by the Court on \nNovember 6, 2015.  \n19 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 20 of 39\n57.  Neither the Olmstead Plan nor the Work Plans addresses CRS facilities or \nindividualized housing services. Nor do they describe how DHS plans to provide \nresidential services in more integrated settings for persons stuck in a CRS facility. \n58.  In its Orders approving the Olmstead plan and the Work Plans, the Court \nreserved jurisdiction over implementation of the plan and the Work Plans. Jensen v. \nMDSH, Order, 14-15, September 29, 2015; Jensen v. MDSH, Order, 3, November 3, \n2015. \n59.  In March, 2016, as part of the Olmstead Plan, Defendants released their \nPerson-Centered, Informed Choice and Transition Protocols (“Protocols”) as a guide for \nlead agencies. Defendants claim the Protocols are designed to communicate DHS’s \nexpectations to lead agencies regarding person-centered practices. \n60.  Although Defendants require lead agencies to implement the Protocols, \nthey have failed to directly inform persons in CRS facilities about person-centered \nplanning services and other individualized housing services that would allow them to \nmove to a more integrated setting.     \n61.  These expectations about person-centered principles and practices in the \nProtocols are purposefully broad, designed to apply to all populations who receive long-\nterm services from Defendants. They only provide generalized suggestions, rather than \nenforceable requirements, for lead agencies to consider when someone receiving services \nis moving from one setting to another.  As such, the Protocols do not ensure Plaintiffs \naccess to a trained person-centered planner who is able to help develop a comprehensive \nindividualized moving plan.   \n20 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 21 of 39\n62.  While Defendants claim the Protocols are useful to helping change general \nculture and practice within Defendants’ service system, they are not designed to help \nPlaintiffs move into the most integrated setting and therefore, they are not sufficient. \nThey fail to direct or provide any guidance as to how lead agencies and individuals with \ndisabilities can actually receive services in the most integrated setting.   \n63.  In earlier drafts of the Olmstead Plan, DHS identified some specific \nindividualized housing services, such as Individualized Housing Options (“IHO”), as \nassistance to help people move to and remain in the most integrated setting. In the current \nplan, however, Defendants have eliminated all references to IHO. The Protocols are \nsimilarly silent on how individuals are supposed to learn about, develop, plan for, move \ninto, and remain in individualized and integrated alternatives to segregated settings. \n64.  Nothing in the Protocols, the Olmstead Plan, or the Work Plans indicates \nhow DHS will reduce its overreliance on CRS facilities by providing appropriate services \nto people entitled to more integrated alternatives than CRS facilities, as required under \nthe integration mandates of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n65.  While Defendants have promised, in the Olmstead Plan, to move 5,547 \npeople into more integrated settings, there are very few details of how or when this will \nhappen, where these persons will come from (including whether or not they will come \nfrom CRS settings), or how and if they will be informed of the purported options.   \n66.  Defendants lack a working plan with accurate data, details, and measurable \ngoals to:  \n21 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 22 of 39\na.  specifically address how to fix its residential service system that over-relies \non CRS facilities to the detriment of integrated alternatives such as \nindividualized housing services; and  \nb.  ensure that Individual Plaintiffs and Class Members are receiving services \nin the most integrated settings. \nMINNESOTA’S RESIDENTIAL SERVICE SYSTEM  \nFOR PERSONS RECEIVING A DISABILITY WAIVER \n \n67.  As noted above, Minnesota’s Disability Waivers pay for residential services \nin a variety of settings, including CRS facilities. Defendants license CRS facilities \nthrough Minnesota Statute Chapter 245D. \n68.  As of July, 2016, there are approximately 3,457 actively licensed CRS \nfacilities, serving nearly 13,800 individual Disability Waiver recipients. \n69.  Defendants have known, since at least 2009, that individuals receiving \nDisability Waiver services need access to individualized housing as an alternative to CRS \nfacilities. In that year, the state legislature enacted a moratorium on the building of new \nCRS facilities. This moratorium has capped the total number of available CRS facility \nbeds statewide.  \n70.  While Defendants currently approve some limited individualized \nalternatives for a small number of Disability Waiver recipients, they have failed to \nrecognize Plaintiffs’ individual choice and circumstances and have thus refused to ensure \nthe residential service system provides services in the most integrated setting. \nThe CRS Model \n22 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 23 of 39\n71.  Before receiving Disability Waiver services, individuals must first go \nthrough an assessment process. If they qualify, the lead agency should offer the \nindividual Disability Waiver services as an alternative to services in an institution.  \n72.  Defendants require the lead agency to develop a support plan for the \nindividual that identifies his or her needs and the types of services necessary and \navailable to meet those needs. Defendants do not ensure, however, that individuals are \nreceiving services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. \n73.  Under the current system, Defendants approve the funding of Disability \nWaiver services in CRS facilities while failing to ensure that such a setting is the most \nintegrated setting appropriate for the individual. \n74.  If given a Disability Waiver, the individual is notified of available CRS \nfacilities where the Disability Waiver will pay for support services. Defendants, however, \ndo not provide information about more integrated alternatives to CRS facilities or \ninformation about how to access individualized housing services. \n75.  If no CRS openings are immediately available, the case manager may \ncontact CRS providers directly, speak with other case managers and lead agencies, or \nsearch the CRS online database to determine when an open bed in a CRS facility may \nbecome available. \n76.  If an opening is located and the CRS operator is willing to accept the \nindividual, then he or she can move in. \n77.  Case managers rarely discuss integrated alternatives to CRS facilities. \nDefendants have failed to require case managers to inform individuals of such services or \n23 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 24 of 39\nprovide individualized plans that could help Disability Waiver recipients choose, plan \nfor, and eventually move into individualized and integrated settings. \n78.  CRS facilities are inadequate for Plaintiffs because they do not enable them \nto access their communities and interact with nondisabled persons in the community to \nthe fullest extent possible as required by the integration mandates of the ADA and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n79.  Although many CRS residents, including Individual Plaintiffs, are told they \ncan go into the community, staffing patterns, CRS house rules, and other administrative \nrestrictions limit the scope and duration individuals can actually participate in everyday \ncommunity activities. \n80.  Many CRS residents have daily tasks done “for them,” even if they want to \nand are capable of doing tasks on their own. The lowered expectations and reduced skill-\nsets that CRS facilities engender pervade the public consciousness. This reinforces and \nperpetuates negative stereotypes about people with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities, mainly that they are unable and unfit to live in more integrated settings. \n81.  Many CRS residents are frequently forced to spend their time secluded in \nCRS facilities, unable to participate in community life with their nondisabled peers. They \nhave little or no choice about whom to associate with, where or when to go into the \ncommunity, and how to structure their everyday schedule and lives. \n82.  This lack of interaction with the larger community can be harmful. For \nmany residents, an unchanging daily routine causes their social and independent living \nskills to atrophy, leading to an even lower likelihood that they will ever transition to \n24 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 25 of 39\nliving and working in the community. It also leads to lower self-esteem and lowered \nexpectations of themselves, similar to the “learned helplessness” described in DAI v. \nPaterson, 653 F. Supp. 2d 184, 214 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (“When individuals are treated as if \nthey are helpless, the helplessness becomes a learned phenomenon.”) (internal quotations \nomitted). \nIntegrated Alternatives to CRS Facilities \n83.  Individualized housing services are both a process and a result. \nCollectively, the process of assisting a person to create an individualized residential \nservices plan and to obtain the services necessary to live in a more integrated setting \ncomplies with the concepts of a “community setting” as required by the CMS Settings \nrule and the most integrated setting as articulated in Olmstead v. L.C.  \n84.  Individuals who develop and live in individualized housing settings are \ngiven greater opportunities to interact and integrate themselves in the greater community, \nas they can, for example, have nondisabled roommates, set their own daily schedules and \nsocial outings, hire and control their staffing and services, and develop networks of \nfriends without disabilities. \n85.  Individualized housing services help ensure individuals are living and \nworking in the most integrated setting. \n86.  Persons receiving individualized housing services experience greater \nopportunities to interact with neighbors, meet and develop relationships with persons \nwithout disabilities, and build or maintain basic living skills in a manner that often is not \npossible in CRS facilities. \n25 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 26 of 39\n87.  Disability Waivers offer services that help individuals transition from less \nintegrated settings into homes of their own. These include, but are not limited to: \na.  the service of Consumer Training and Education and Family Training and \nCounseling, which allows individuals to hire trained person-centered \nplanners to help develop self-advocacy skills and create more \nindividualized service plans, including a personal housing transition plan \nthat will lay the foundation for a move into a more integrated setting; and \nb.  the service of Housing Access Coordination and Transitional Services \nwhich helps people with the logistics of moving. \n88.  Plaintiffs want access to these and other Disability Waiver services to help \nthem transition to more integrated settings, but Defendants fail to ensure individuals have \nnotice of, information regarding, or access to these services. Because these services are \nnever offered or provided, Plaintiffs have no means of appealing or otherwise challenging \nDHS’s actions. \n89.  Defendants claim their Protocols require lead agencies to follow person-\ncentered practices when individuals with disabilities are moving from one setting to \nanother. Disability Waiver recipients, however, have no means of knowing about the \nProtocols or any mechanism to enforce them.   \n90.  Furthermore, Defendants’ Protocols only provide generalized and vague \nsuggestions regarding person-centered planning rather than requiring specific, \ncustomized, written, and enforceable personal housing transition plans necessary to help \nindividuals plan for, develop, and eventually move into integrated and individualized \n26 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 27 of 39\nsettings. The Protocols also fail to ensure service recipients will be offered the \nopportunity to receive person-centered planning, transition, and individualized housing \nservices from trained providers. \n91.  DHS regulates all individualized housing services for individuals with \ndisabilities while primarily relying on individual counties and private service providers to \nprovide such services. Defendants have designed Protocols that fail to provide or require \npolicies, procedures, rules, or other regulations to direct counties to deliver individualized \nhousing services. \n92.  As a result of Defendants’ lack of individualized housing services \nmanagement, Plaintiffs are denied access to individualized housing services. \n93.  Because of Defendants’ lack of planning and oversight, there is a severe \nshortage of individualized housing providers in the state. \n94.  Defendants have failed to implement individualized housing services as \nalternatives to CRS, or to ensure that its current service planning system requires even the \nconsideration of alternatives to CRS. Defendants have also failed to implement the \nintegrated residential goals of persons with disabilities, or to ensure there is a sufficient \ncapacity or planning for individualized housing services to allow persons with disabilities \nto find individualized housing and support to live in a setting more integrated than CRS \nfacilities. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n95.  Plaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure; the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \n27 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 28 of 39\nof the Constitution of the United States and the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(8) \nand 1396a(a)(3), as enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12101 and 12131 et seq. and implementing regulations; and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and implementing regulations.  \n96.  The Individual Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and other \nindividuals age 18 and older who are eligible for and have received a Disability Waiver, \nlive in a licensed CRS facility, and have not been given the choice and opportunity to \nreside in the most integrated residential setting appropriate to their needs. \n97.  The members in the Class are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable. \n98.  The Class is ascertainable, as all potential Class Members can be identified \nin Defendants’ current records of Medical Assistance and Disability Waiver recipients \nand CRS facility residents. \n99.  Plaintiffs estimate that there are at least 800 members of the Class. \n100.  There are common issues of law relating to the Class that predominate, \nincluding, among other issues: \na.  whether the Defendants are violating the Due Process Clause of the United \nStates Constitution and Plaintiffs’ Medicaid rights by failing to provide \nwritten notice of appeal rights when Individualized Housing services are \ndenied, including person-centered planning provided through the Disability \nWaivers and notice of appeal rights for such denial; \n28 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 29 of 39\nb.  whether the Defendants are violating the Plaintiffs’ Medicaid rights by \nfailing to provide timely access to person-centered planning; \nc.  whether the Defendants are violating the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by \nplanning, administering, and operating a residential services system that: \ni.  unnecessarily segregates Plaintiffs in CRS facilities and fails to \nprovide informed choice of more integrated alternatives; \nii.  discriminates against the Plaintiffs by providing residential services \nto them in settings that are not the most integrated settings \nappropriate to their needs; and \niii.  fails to provide the Plaintiffs with individualized housing services to \nallow them to transition to the most integrated settings appropriate to \ntheir needs. \n101.  There are common issues of fact relating to the Class that predominate, \nincluding, among other facts: \na.  whether the Plaintiffs are receiving notice of adverse action and opportunity \nto challenge the failure to provide individualized housing services, \nincluding person-centered planning services; \nb.  whether the Defendants have failed to provide person-centered planning \nservices to Plaintiffs with reasonable promptness; \nc.  whether as a result of the Defendants’ actions and inactions in planning, \nadministering, and operating the residential service system for persons with \n29 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 30 of 39\ndisabilities, Plaintiffs are provided services that enable them to live in the \nmost integrated residential setting appropriate to their needs; and \nd.  whether the Defendants have a comprehensive and effective working plan \nfor providing integrated residential services to the Plaintiffs. \n102.  The Individual Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief individually \nand on behalf of the respective Class Members in order to access, utilize, and benefit \nfrom the Disability Waiver services for which they are eligible. The Individual Plaintiffs \nadequately and fairly represent the interest of all Class Members, will fully and \nvigorously prosecute this action, and are represented by attorneys experienced in class \naction litigation and disability law. \n103.  The Individual Plaintiffs’ injuries and claims are typical of those of the \nClass in that all the Class Members are unable to access and use individualized housing \nservices for the purpose of moving to the most integrated setting appropriate to their \nneeds. This harm to Class Members is a result of the Defendants’ failure to act properly \nwith regard to planning, administering, and supporting their residential service system for \npersons with disabilities. \n104.  Individual Plaintiffs and Class Members have a common remedy: \nmodifications to Defendants’ residential service system to provide individuals with \nchoices and prevent needless segregation of individuals in segregated residential settings. \nCOUNT I \n (Asserted Against Commissioner Piper) \nFailure to Furnish Services with Reasonable Promptness in Violation of \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) as Enforceable Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n30 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 31 of 39\n105.  Plaintiffs re-allege the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth \nherein. \n106.  Minnesota voluntarily participates in the federal Medicaid program under \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., and as a condition of its participation in that program, must \nensure that services for eligible persons are provided in a reasonably prompt manner.  \n107.  The Medicaid program in Minnesota includes the provision of Disability \nWaiver services that Plaintiffs receive. \n108.  Federal law requires any state which has elected to participate in the \nMedicaid program under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., to provide all services to eligible \nindividuals with reasonable promptness. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); 42 C.F.R. § 435.930. \n109.  Defendant Piper has administered and continues to administer Disability \nWaiver services in a manner that denies Plaintiffs person-centered planning and other \nindividualized housing services offered through Disability Waivered services.  \n110.  Specifically, Defendant Piper has failed to establish administrative \nprocedures that ensure individuals who are qualified for and requesting services to help \ntransition to a more integrated setting will actually receive those services. She has failed \nto direct counties and lead agencies to obtain, respond to, and act upon individual \nrequests to use Disability Waiver services in more integrated settings. Her actions and \ninactions have violated Plaintiffs’ rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) and its \nimplementing regulations and thus are enforceable as violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n111.  Defendant Piper’s acts and omissions violate the law and have caused and \ncontinue to cause Plaintiffs harm. Defendant Piper has denied Plaintiffs timely \n31 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 32 of 39\nindividualized housing services without proper notice thereof, and they have thereby \nsustained injuries that include, but are not limited to, ongoing segregation from persons \nwithout disabilities. \n112.

Plaintiffs re-allege the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth \nherein. \n114.  Plaintiffs are Medicaid beneficiaries receiving a Disability Waiver who \nhave been denied access to individualized housing services, including person-centered \nplanning, due to Defendant Piper’s actions and inactions. \n115.  Defendant Piper has failed to provide Plaintiffs notice of adverse action and \nopportunity to challenge the failure to provide these individualized housing services.  \n116.  Defendant Piper has failed to require lead agencies to provide Plaintiffs \nnotice of adverse action and opportunity to challenge the failure to provide these \nindividualized housing services. \n117.  These failures have resulted in ongoing harm and Plaintiffs’ continued \ninability to receive individualized housing services.  \n118.  Defendant Piper’s conduct has caused Plaintiffs harm and has violated: \n32 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 08/03/16   Page 33 of 39\na.

Defendant Piper’s conduct violates Plaintiffs’ rights and is redressable \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n120.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and declaratory relief resulting \nfrom the violation of Plaintiffs’ Constitutional rights and injunctive relief, declaratory \nrelief, and attorneys’ fees and costs resulting from the violation of Medicaid rights, as \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nCOUNT III \n(Asserted Against Commissioner Piper) \nViolation of Title II of  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act \n \n121.

No. 16-2623 (DWF/BRT) \nRichard Murphy; Marrie Bottelson; and   \nDionne Swanson; and on behalf of others \nsimilarly situated,   \n \nORDER ON PLAINTIFFS’  \n  Plaintiffs, \nMOTION PURSUANT TO  \nv.  RULE 37(B)(2)  \nEmily Johnson Piper, in her capacity as \nCommissioner of the Minnesota \nDepartment of Human Services, \n \n      Defendant. \n \nJoseph W. Anthony, Esq., Peter McElligott, Esq., and Steven M. Pincus, Esq., Anthony \nOstlund Baer & Louwagie PA; and Justin H. Perl, Esq., Christen Leigh Chapman, Esq., \nand Steven C.

No. 175). Plaintiffs assert Defendant’s supplemental response to Plaintiffs’ \nInterrogatory No. 6(c) is deficient. In particular, Plaintiffs seek sanctions because the \nresponse makes clear that Defendant is still withholding information she has in her \npossession, custody, and control, even after this Interrogatory has been fully litigated \nresulting in a Court order requiring Defendant to supplement her response in full. \nThrough this motion, Plaintiffs request the Court compel Defendant to fully and finally \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 2 of 17\ncomply with the Court’s prior order, pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable expenses and attorney’s \nfees in bringing this motion, and find Defendant’s failure to comply as contempt of court. \nThe Court held a hearing on the motion on February 8, 2018, at which the parties were \nrepresented by counsel.  \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Applicable Law  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 governs discovery in federal court. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 26(b)(1). Discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, however, is not \nwithout bounds even if relevance is shown. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2)(C) \nprovides: \nOn motion or on its own, the court must limit the frequency or extent of \ndiscovery otherwise allowed by these rules or by local rule if it determines \nthat:  \n \n(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can \nbe obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less \nburdensome, or less expensive; \n \n(ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the \ninformation by discovery in the action; or \n \n(iii) the proposed discovery is outside the scope permitted by Rule 26(b)(1).  \n \nRule 26(b)(1) provides that: \n[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is \nrelevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the \ncase, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the \namount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, \nthe parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the \nissues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery \noutweighs its likely benefit.  \n \n2 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 3 of 17\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). The Court has already determined that information responsive to \nInterrogatory 6(c) is both relevant and proportional to the needs of the case. At issue now \nbefore the Court is whether Defendant’s supplemental response is adequate. \nRule 33 explains that a party answering interrogatories “must furnish the \ninformation available to the party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(1)(B). Specifically—and \nimportantly— it must “provide information that is available to it and can be produced \nwithout undue labor and expense.” Lindholm v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, Civ. No. 3:15-CV-\n03003-RAL, 2016 WL 452315, at *5 (D.S.D. Feb. 5, 2016) (quoting Miller v. Pruneda, \n236 F.R.D. 277, 282 (N.D. W. Va. 2004)). However, an interrogatory may not demand \n“extensive investigations or . . . complex research.” Miller, 236 F.R.D. at 282 (citation \nomitted). An individual defendant named in her official capacity must answer \ninterrogatories directed at the government entity “using all reasonably obtainable \ninformation within [her] possession, custody or control, including records maintained by \n[the relevant government entity].” See Tyler v. Suffolk Cty., 256 F.R.D. 34, 37–38 (D. \nMass. 2009).  \n  In raising an objection to an interrogatory, the objecting party has the burden to \ndemonstrate “that the information sought is not reasonably available to it.” Lindholm, \n2016 WL 452315, at *5 (citing 8B Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 2174 (3d ed. 2010)). “If the answering party lacks necessary information to \nmake a full, fair and specific answer to an interrogatory, it should so state under oath and \nshould set forth in detail the efforts made to obtain the information.” Id. (quoting Essex \nBuilders Grp., Inc. v. Amerisure Ins., 230 F.R.D. 682, 685 (M.D. Fla. 2005)); see also \n3 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 4 of 17\nWright, supra, § 2177 & n.5 (“If a party is unable to give a complete answer to an \ninterrogatory, it should furnish any relevant information that is available.”).  \nII.  Interrogatory 6(c): Responses, Motion Practice, and Court Orders \n  Plaintiffs served Interrogatory No. 6 on Defendant on February 21, 2017. \nInterrogatory No. 6 states the following: \nINTERROGATORY NO. 6:  For each lead agency, identify: \n \na.  Current compliance with the Person-Centered, Informed Choice, \nand Transition Protocol, available at: http://mn.gov/dhs-\nstat/images/pcp_protocol.pdf; \n \nb.  The number of individuals who have moved from a corporate \nfoster care facility into an alternative to foster care; and \n \nc.  For each person identified in part b of this interrogatory, explain \nand describe in detail how the transition and move occurred.   \n \n(Doc. No. 70, Aff. of Sean Burke in Supp. of Mot. to Compel Disc. (“Burke Aff.”) ¶ 2, \nEx. A at 8.) Defendant responded and refused to answer the Interrogatory, stating the \nfollowing: \nOBJECTION:   Defendant objects to this Interrogatory because it is \noverbroad, unduly burdensome, seeks irrelevant information, and is vague \nspecifically as to time and with respect to the meaning of “compliance.” \nDefendant further objects to this Interrogatory to the extent it seeks \ninformation about individuals other than the Named Plaintiffs; specifically, \nthe Interrogatory seeks irrelevant information to the extent it seeks \ninformation about lead agencies other than Hennepin County, because \nHennepin County is the county of service for all Named Plaintiffs. \n \n(Burke Aff. ¶ 4, Ex. C at 17–18.) Thereafter, Defendant supplemented her response to \nInterrogatory No. 6, restating the objection above and stating the following answer: \nANSWER:   Subject to and without waiving the general objections above \nand these specific objections, Defendant states the following: \n4 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 5 of 17\n \n  As to (a),  . . . . \n \n  As to (b), in 2016, 704 individuals moved out of corporate foster \ncare into alternate living situations. \n \n  As to (c), Defendant does not have responsive information. \n \n(Burke Aff. ¶ 6, Ex. E at 9–10.) \n  As is quite obvious, Defendant’s initial response did not disclose that responsive \ninformation may be stored in “the various databases that are used by DHS in the \nadministration of Disability Waivers,” which include the Medicaid Management \nInformation System (“MMIS”), the Waiver Management System (“WMS”), the \nCustomer Relationship Management (“CRM”), the MAXIS, the Social Service \nInformation System (“SSIS”), the Rates Management System (“RMS”), MnCHOICES \nAssessment and Support Planning Databases, and Lead Agency Reviews (“LAR”). (Doc. \nNo. 182, Decl. of Alexandra Barolic ¶ 2.) Apparently, without looking at the databases \nnow at issue, Defendant simply stated that she “does not have responsive information.” \n(Burke Aff. ¶ 6, Ex. E at 10.)  \nOn July 31, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel with respect to this \nInterrogatory, among others. (Doc. No. 65.) Presumably, because Defendant claimed to \nhave no responsive information in its possession or control regarding to Interrogatory \n6(c), Plaintiffs’ motion focused on a need for more identifying data, and in particular \nasked for “the name and contact information of persons identified in response[] to \nInterrogator[y] 6[.]” (Doc. No. 68, Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Compel Disc. 20–24.) \nPlaintiffs explained their reasoning, stating: “These groups have transitioned out of \n5 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 6 of 17\ncorporate foster care and into some type of alternative. Plaintiffs believe their experiences \nare directly relevant to theories of liability and scope of possible relief. Plaintiffs want to \nsample this group of people to learn more information about how and why they were \nsuccessful in moving out, and whether they are now living in a more integrated setting.” \n(Id. at 22.) In opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion, Defendant did not call out Interrogatory \nNo. 6 specifically in her response. Instead, Defendant argued generally that (1) \ndocuments held by lead agencies were not in Defendant’s possession, custody, or control; \n(2) Defendant has no legal right to obtain individual case management documents from \nlead agencies; (3) individual case management documents about all disability waiver \nrecipients are not relevant and not proportional to the needs of the case; and (4) the \nidentifying information about non-named plaintiffs is not relevant. (Id. at 16–21.) \n  On August 21, 2017, the undersigned issued an Order on Plaintiffs’ motion. This \nCourt acknowledged that a party responding to interrogatories must respond in \naccordance with Rules 26 and 33, but was not required to obtain and review third-party \ndocuments pursuant to Rule 34 (i.e., regarding requests for production) in order to \ncompletely answer interrogatories. (Doc. No. 78, 8/21/17 Order at 13.) However, this \nCourt also stated: \n[W]hen answering interrogatories, a party does have an obligation to “make \nefforts to obtain the desired information.” See 8B Charles Alan Wright & \nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2163 (3d ed. 2010). \n“The party objecting to interrogatories bears the burden of showing that the \ninformation sought is not reasonably available to it.” Lindholm v. BMW, \nNo. 3:15-CV-03003-RAL, 2016 WL 452315, *5 (D.S.D. Feb. 5, 2016). “If \nthe answering party lacks necessary information to make a full, fair and \nspecific answer to an interrogatory, it should so state under oath and should \n6 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 7 of 17\nset forth in detail the efforts made to obtain the information.” Id. \n(quotations omitted).  \n \n(Id. at 13–14.) Specifically regarding Interrogatory No. 6(c), this Court ruled as follows: \n  As to Part c.—how the transition occurred with respect to the 704 \nindividuals—Defendant contends that she does not have responsive \ninformation. Defendant must, however, make efforts to obtain the desired \ninformation. If Defendant lacks necessary information to make a full, fair, \nand specific answer to an interrogatory, she must state so under oath and \nDefendant must also set forth in detail the efforts made to obtain the \ninformation. As to this interrogatory, an answer setting forth in detail the \nefforts made to obtain the information must include an explanation as to \nwhy records required to be maintained pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 431.17 do \nnot provide responsive information. Finally, if Defendant refers or relies on \nany documents for purposes of her answer, those documents must be \nproduced or disclosed pursuant to Document Request No. 4. \n \n(Id. at 16.) \n  Defendant appealed this Court’s Order to United States District Court Judge \nDonovan W. Frank. (Doc. No. 79.) Specifically, she sought reversal of the undersigned’s \nOrder, arguing that Defendant should not have to supplement interrogatories “by \nreviewing the complete case management records held by lead agencies.” (Id. at 1.) With \nrespect to her argument about Interrogatory 6(c) on appeal, Defendant stated the \nfollowing: “704 individuals were identified in part b. Defendant would have to review \nindividual case-management records of 704 Waiver recipients to answer this question.” \n(Id. at 3.) Thereafter, Defendant made a burdensome and proportionality argument, \nstating that answering “all of the at-issue interrogatories” on appeal “would require a \ngreat deal of time and resources.” (Id. at 4–5.) Defendant went on to argue that all \nindividual case management records held by lead agencies are not within the control or \nreasonably available to Defendant. (Id. at 8.) In Plaintiffs’ response to Defendant’s \n7 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 8 of 17\nappeal, they pointed out that “Defendant does not need to review every document in \nevery individual case management file,” but that “Defendant need only review, or ask \nlead agencies and/or case managers to review, portions of the case management files \nrelated to transition” to respond to Interrogatory No. 6(c). (Doc. No. 91 at 10.) \n  On November 22, 2017, United States District Judge Frank affirmed the \nundersigned’s August 21, 2017 Order. (Doc. No. 151.) In doing so, the Court noted that \nthe August Order did “not specify that Defendant[] must contact the 87 lead agencies to \nobtain information from case management files in order to answer each interrogatory,” \nbut instead “specifies that Defendant must make efforts to obtain information and state \nunder oath what efforts were undertaken if Defendant determines she is unable to answer \nthe questions posed with information that is available to her.” (Id. at 9.) Judge Frank \n“decline[d] to conclude that requiring Defendant to reach out to lead agencies to answer \ninterrogatories would in all circumstances be unreasonable or beyond the scope of what is \npermitted under the relevant discovery rules,” and stated that “[i]f Defendant determines \nthat information from lead agencies is not reasonably available to her, she must articulate \nwhy that is the case with respect to the particular information being requested.” (Id. at 9–\n10.) Judge Frank concluded that the discovery ordered—which would have included \nresponding to Interrogatory No. 6(c)—“is both relevant and proportional under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1).” (Id. at 10.)  \n  While Defendant’s appeal was pending—and in response to this Court’s August \nOrder requiring Defendant to supplement Interrogatory No. 6(c) by September 7th—\n8 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 9 of 17\nDefendant did supplement its response. Defendant restated her original objection to \nInterrogatory No. 6, and then stated the following with respect to Interrogatory No. 6(c): \nAs to (c), Defendant does not have responsive information. \nDefendant does not have responsive information to (c) because “details” \nabout how a transition and move occurred would be reflected in case \nmanagement records and is not data held by Defendant. \n \n  In order to obtain information responsive to this interrogatory, DHS \nin-house counsel worked with DSD leadership and staff in order to discover \nwhat records DHS had which might provide responsive information. DSD \nleadership and staff most familiar with the subject matter of transition \nplanning identified key staff members who would be likely to have \nresponsive information and those key staff people were then contacted to \ndetermine what information they had. For this interrogatory, DSD staff \ndetermined that the most responsive information DHS would be able to \nobtain would be in DHS’ MMIS database. MMIS is described on the DHS \nwebsite.[] However, as to (c), the MMIS database does not contain specific \ndetails about how a transition or move occurred. \n \n  As required by 42 CFR 431.17, DHS maintains the following \nrecords for waiver recipients: \n \n1.  Date of application . . . . \n2.  Date of and basis for disposition . . . . \n3.  Facts essential to the determination of initial and continuing \neligibility . . . . \n4.  Provision of medical assistance . . . . \n5.  Basis for discontinuing assistance . . . . \n6.  The disposition of income and eligibility verification information \nreceived under §§ 435.940 through 435.960 of this subchapter . . . . \n7.  Statistical, fiscal, and other records necessary for reporting and \naccountability as required by the Secretary . . . . \n \nCertain databases enable users to add notes, and in some cases to attach \nmiscellaneous documents, but Defendant cannot know whether responsive \ninformation would be retained in any of those notes or miscellaneous \ndocuments without reviewing all notes and all miscellaneous documents as \nto all Disability Waiver recipients in all databases. It would be \ndisproportionate to the needs of the case and unduly burdensome to review \nall of that information because thousands of individuals receive Disability \nWaivers. It is also unlikely such notes or miscellaneous documents would \n9 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 10 of 17\ncontain sufficient information to fully answer the interrogatories, even as to \nspecific individuals.  \n \n  DHS is not required to and does not maintain complete individual \ncase management files for compliance with 42 CFR 431.17. Case \nmanagement is handled at the lead agency level . . . . Complete individual \ncase management files containing details on the particular resources an \nindividual uses to transition from a corporate foster care facility[] to an \nalternative living arrangement are maintained only by lead agencies.  \n \n(Doc. No. 169, Def.’s Responses to Pls.’ First Set of Interrogatories (Third Supplement) \n8–11.)  \n  After a status conference with the undersigned on December 11, 2017 (Doc. \nNo. 159), and further confirmation by Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs indicated by letter dated \nDecember 29, 2017, that there was still a dispute as to Defendant’s response to \nInterrogatory 6(c). (Doc. No. 164.) Defendant filed a responsive letter on January 8, \n2018. (Doc. No. 167.) The Court then instructed Plaintiffs to file a formal motion on the \nissue by February 7, 2018, if not resolved through further meet and confer. (Doc. \nNo. 168.) On January 25, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the present motion with the Court. (Doc. \nNo. 175.) In Plaintiffs’ motion, they contend Defendant’s supplemental response shows \nshe is still withholding information she has in her possession, custody, and control \nresponsive to Interrogatory No. 6(c). Plaintiffs request the Court compel Defendant to \nfully comply with the Court’s prior Order, pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable expenses and \nattorney’s fees in bringing this motion, and find Defendant’s failure to comply as \ncontempt of court. \n   \n10 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 11 of 17\nIII.  Analysis \n  This Court finds that Defendant’s supplemental response to Interrogatory 6(c) is \nnot adequate. First, Defendant’s response is internally inconsistent. She states that “[a]s \nto (c), Defendant does not have responsive information.” (Doc. No. 169, Def.’s \nResponses to Pls.’ First Set of Interrogatories (Third Supplement) 8 (emphasis added).) \nDefendant then states, “Defendant does not have responsive information to (c) because \n‘details’ about how a transition and move occurred would be reflected in case \nmanagement records and is not data held by Defendant.” (Id. (emphasis added).) Yet, \nDefendant later states, “For this interrogatory, DSD staff determined that the most \nresponsive information DHS would be able to obtain would be in DHS’ MMIS \ndatabase.” (Id. at 9 (emphasis added).) Therefore, the data would be in one of \nDefendant’s databases and thus held by Defendant, contrary to her earlier statement; and \nif there, Defendant would have responsive information. \nSecond, when Defendant submitted papers in response to this motion, she included \ninformation that even more clearly showed that Defendant has responsive information \nthat was not included in her supplemental response. For example, Defendant submitted \nthe Declaration of Alexandra Bartolic, the Director of the Disability Services Division at \nthe Department of Human Services; she states she is “familiar with the various databases \nthat are used by DHS in the administration of Disability Waivers[.]” (Barolic Decl. ¶ 2.) \nOf those databases “that are used by DHS,” she says that the MnChoices Assessment and \nSupport Planning database, CRM database, the SSIS database, and the LAR database \n“could contain some information related to how a transition occurred for an individual \n11 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 12 of 17\nwho stopped residing in a Corporate Foster Care.” (Id. ¶ 4.) Defendant admittedly has \naccess to these databases (i.e., the databases she concedes would have the most \nresponsive information). She simply chose not to search them because she contends the \nsearch (1) would be too burdensome and (2) would not result in enough information to \ngive a “full” response to Interrogatory No. 6(c). \n Defendant had the full opportunity to argue burden when Interrogatory No. 61 \nwas previously being litigated and appealed. In fact, Defendant did raise a \nburden/proportionality argument to Judge Frank on appeal, and he overruled that \nobjection. (Doc. No. 151 at 9 (stating that “Defendant must make efforts to obtain \ninformation”).) Defendant states in her supplemental response, “Certain databases enable \nusers to add notes, and in some cases to attach miscellaneous documents, but Defendant \ncannot know whether responsive information would be retained in any of those notes or \nmiscellaneous documents without reviewing all notes and all miscellaneous documents as \nto all Disability Waiver recipients in all databases.” (Doc. No. 169, Def.’s Responses to \n                                                           \n1   Defendant contends that Plaintiffs’ prior motion to compel was focused only on \nInterrogatory 6(b), not 6(c). Although Plaintiffs did focus on obtaining identifying \ninformation in that motion, Plaintiffs did not limit their motion to Interrogatory 6(b).  \n(Doc. No. 68, Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Compel Disc. 20–24.) Instead, the \nreasoning provided by Plaintiffs for gaining information relative to Interrogatory 6 \nincluded that they wanted to “learn more information about how and why [the \nindividuals] were successful in moving out, and whether they are now living in a more \nintegrated setting.” (Id. at 22.) This is directly relevant to Interrogatory 6(c). Further, at \nthe hearing on that motion, it was made clear that 6(b) was a request seeking only “[t]he \nnumber of individuals.” (“Burke Aff.” ¶ 2, Ex. A at 8.) Even setting all of that aside, \nDefendant did not limit her opposition or her appeal to Interrogatory 6(b). In fact, her \nappeal included reference to Interrogatory 6(c). (Doc. No. 79 at 3.) \n \n12 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 13 of 17\nPls.’ First Set of Interrogatories (Third Supplement) 10.) While this may be true, \nDefendant has to look. The Court finds that the time that it will take to look for this \ninformation—information that Defendant concedes is available to her—is not overly \nburdensome and it is proportional to the needs of this case. See Lindholm, 2016 WL \n452315, at *5 (stating that the objecting party has the burden to demonstrate “that the \ninformation sought is not reasonably available to it”); see also Westinghouse Credit \nCorp. v. Mountain States Mining & Milling Co., 37 F.R.D. 348, 349 (D. Colo. 1965) \n(“The majority interpretation of Rule 33 requires that a corporation furnish such \ninformation as is available from the corporation itself or from sources under its \ncontrol.”); Am. Int’l Specialty Lines Ins. Co. v. NWI-I, Inc., 240 F.R.D. 401, 413 (N.D. \nIll. 2007) (“Rule 33 imposes a duty to provide full answers to interrogatories, including \nall the information within the responding party’s knowledge and control.”). \nDefendant further contends that she need not search the databases because she \nbelieves the information that she would receive from that search would be fragmented \nand would not allow for her to make a “full, fair, and specific” response to Interrogatory \n6(c). First, Defendant will not know for certain what information she has until she looks. \nAnd second, Defendant is misreading what “full, fair, and specific” means. It does not \nmean that if a party has some—but not complete—information on a topic, then they are \nunable to provide a “full, fair, and specific” response. Providing a “full, fair, and \nspecific” response means providing an answer that is complete with “all the information \nwithin the responding party’s knowledge and control.” Am. Int’l Specialty Lines Ins. Co., \n240 F.R.D. at 413; see also Wright, supra, § 2177 (“[I]nterrogatories should be answered \n13 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 14 of 17\ndirectly and without evasion in accordance with information that the answering party \npossesses after due inquiry.”)). And “[i]f a party is unable to give a complete answer to \nan interrogatory, it should furnish any relevant information that is available.” Id. § 2177 \n& n.5. Here, Defendant admittedly has databases available to her that likely contain the \nmost relevant information.  \nTherefore, Defendant has to look for the responsive information in the databases, \nand she has to supplement Interrogatory 6(c) with any responsive information. To the \nextent this information provides a lead to additional responsive information, those leads \nmust also be pursued in order to locate responsive information within Defendant’s \npossession and control. To be certain that Defendant complies with this Court’s Order \nand with what a complete response to Interrogatory No. 6(c) requires, Defendant must \ninclude in her supplemental response a chart that accounts for all 704 individuals, \nincludes what information was learned about the transition, and includes the source(s) of \nthe information. A sample chart is as follows: \nAssigned  Date of  Information known about   Source of  Source of Information \nnumber for  the  the Transition  Information  (Person or Persons) \nIndividuals  Transition  (Documents) \n1 – 704  \n1.    [provide narrative about what  [list data base searched,  [list persons who \nDefendant knows about how  and documents  provided information] \nthe transition and move  reviewed by Bates \noccurred]  number] \n2.

[insert paragraphs – explain  [list data base searched,  [list persons who \nand describe information you  and documents  provided information] \nknow about how the  reviewed by Bates \ntransition and move  number] \noccurred] \n704.    [insert paragraphs – explain  [list data base searched,  [list persons who \nand describe information you  and documents  provided information] \nknow about how the  reviewed by Bates \ntransition and move  number] \noccurred] \n \nAgain, if Defendant refers or relies on any documents for purposes of her answer, those \ndocuments must be produced or disclosed pursuant to Document Request No. 4. At this \nstage, Interrogatory No. 6(c) has been fully addressed and objections regarding the \nburden to respond to Interrogatory No. 6(c) have either been addressed previously or are \nnow hereby overruled.2  Defendant has thirty (30) days to supplement her response.3  \n                                                           \n2   The basic rules of discovery clearly required Defendant to disclose responsive \ninformation within its custody and control – or timely object when the response was due. \nSee Wright, supra, § 2177 (“[I]nterrogatories should be answered directly and without \nevasion in accordance with information that the answering party possesses after due \ninquiry.”). Defendant does not dispute that the interrogatory called for information within \nDHS’s control. The argument that more complete information was held by the lead \nagencies—which Defendant asserts was outside Defendant’s control—did not excuse \nDefendant from responding with what is indisputably in her possession and control. Nor \ndoes it allow a party to raise yet additional objections after production is compelled. See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 33 (b)(4) (“The grounds for objecting to an interrogatory must be stated \nwith specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the court, \nfor good cause, excuses the failure.”). As discussed above, Defendant had the opportunity \nto object (and did object generally) on burdensomeness grounds when Interrogatory \nNo. 6 was being litigated. However, up until now, Defendant was silent regarding any \nspecific burden that would flow from searching databases. Her failure to timely object on \nthe burden of searching databases—which are and were within Defendant’s control when \nDefendant submitted her first response and objections to Interrogatory No. 6—results in a \nwaiver of that specific objection.  \n \n3   Notably, Judge Frank “decline[d] to conclude that requiring Defendant to reach \nout to lead agencies to answer interrogatories would in all circumstances be unreasonable \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page) \n15 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 16 of 17\n  Finally, Plaintiffs also request further sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 37 in the form of finding Defendant in contempt and in the form of attorney’s \nfees and costs for Defendant’s failure to comply with Court orders and for necessitating \nthe filing of this motion. This Court has broad discretion in imposing discovery sanctions. \nGood Stewardship Christian Ctr. v. Empire Bank, 341 F.3d 794, 797–98 (8th Cir. 2003); \nsee also Nat’l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 642 (1976) \n(noting abuse of discretion standard). Although this Court finds Defendant’s reasons for \nnot searching its databases and for not providing a complete answer to Interrogatory 6(c) \nperplexing, especially in light of both its and Judge Frank’s prior orders, this Court will \nnot at this time award further sanctions. Conducting the database searches, reviewing the \ninformation, and supplementing Interrogatory No. 6(c) with what information Defendant \nhas that is responsive is what is required. If Defendant does not comply with this Court \nOrder, the Court reserves the right to impose the sanctions Plaintiffs have requested, \nfurther sanctions the Plaintiffs request, or other sanctions the Court finds fair and just. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ request for further sanctions is denied without prejudice.    \n   \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(Footnote Continued from Previous Page) \nor beyond the scope of what is permitted under the relevant discovery rules.” (Doc. \nNo. 151 at 9–10.) Nothing in this Order should be interpreted to mean that reaching out to \nlead agencies to answer interrogatories would be unreasonable or too burdensome. \nInstead, the Court limits the relief ordered here to that requested, which was for \nDefendant to search her databases for responsive information. \n16 \n \n\nCASE 0:16-cv-02623-DWF-LIB   Doc. 189   Filed 02/21/18   Page 17 of 17\nORDER \n  Based on the file, records, argument of counsel, and for all of the above reasons, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.

No. 495), and Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (Doc. No. 480).  For the \n\nreasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiffs’ motion, and \ndenies Defendant’s motion. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Factual Background \nThe Court previously detailed the background of this case in its May 18, 2017 \nMemorandum Opinion and Order (Doc. No. 54 (“May 2017 Order”)) and the Court only \nbriefly summarizes the facts here.1  In short, Plaintiffs are individuals with disabilities \nand Medicaid recipients who receive Home and Community Based Disability Waivers \n(“Disability Waivers”) from the State of Minnesota under the direction of Defendant Jodi \nHarpstead (“Defendant”), Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human \nServices (“DHS”).2  Plaintiffs reside, or did reside3, in Community Residential Setting \n(“CRS”) facilities, known as corporate adult foster care (“CFC”)4—and wish to access \n \n1  The Court directs readers to its May 2017 Order and otherwise assumes familiarity \nwith the facts and law elaborated therein.  See Murphy by Murphy v. Minn. Dep’t of \nHuman Servs., 260 F. Supp. 3d 1084 (D. Minn. 2017).  To the extent necessary, the Court \nsupplements the facts with new or different information obtained subsequent to \ndiscovery.  The Court’s analysis is based on the entire record before it; it is not limited to \nthe facts available at the time of its May 2017 Order.   \n \n2  Defendant delegates certain Disability Waiver operational functions to Minnesota \ncounties and tribal entities (henceforth, “Lead Agencies”).  (Doc. No. 578 (“Schmidt \nAff. 3”) ¶ 2, Doc. No. 578-1, Ex. 1 (“Bartolic Dep.”) at 3; see also Minn. Stat. § 256B.05, \nsubd. 1.) \n \n3  Two of the named plaintiffs who lived in CFC facilities when this Court granted \nclass certification subsequently moved out of CFC facilities.  (See Doc. No. 423 ¶ 6, \nEx. 5 at 230;  Doc. No. 494 ¶ 29, Ex. 28, Doc. No. 535 at 110-11.) \n \n4  CFC facilities are “licensed foster care setting[s] where the license holder does not  \n(Footnoted continued on next page.) \n2 \n\nvarious individualized housing services available under the Disability Waivers to pursue \nmore integrated housing options (“IHO”).5  Plaintiffs assert that CFC facilities isolate and \nsegregate them from their communities in violation of federal law.   \nPlaintiffs assert the following claims against Commissioner Jodi Harpstead in her \nofficial capacity:  (1) failure to furnish Medicaid services with reasonable promptness \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count I); (2) violation \nof Plaintiffs’ Due Process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid \nAct’s advance notice and fair hearing requirements, enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n(Count II); (3) violation of Title II of the ADA (Count III); and (4) violation of § 504 of \nthe RA (Count IV).  (Doc. No. 33 (“Am. Compl.”)  ¶¶ 1-32.) \n \n(Footnoted continued from previous page.) \nreside.”  (Doc. No. 503 (“Schmidt Aff. 1”) ¶ 3, Doc. No. 503-1, Ex. 2 at 253; see also \nMinn. Stat. § 245D.02, subd. 4a.)  Plaintiffs assert that CFC facilities typically contain \nfour or five unrelated Disability Waiver recipients who all receive similar services from \nthe same provider.  (See Schmidt Aff. 1 ¶ 4, Doc. No. 503-1, Ex. 3 (“Pl. Resp. to \nInterrog.”) at 263-64.)   \n \n5  Defendant claims that the term “IHO” is neither a Disability Waiver service or \nsetting classification, but a concept independently advanced by Plaintiffs which includes \na requirement that a Disability Waiver recipient rent or own their residence.  (Doc. \nNo. 482 (“Def. Memo.”) at 10, n.10.)  Plaintiffs contend that Defendant only recently \nabandoned the term after previously stating in a document related to their Olmstead Plan \nthat IHOs “help more persons with disabilities live in community setting[s] of their \nchoice.”  (Doc. No. 573 (“Pl. Opp.:) at 9, n.9.)  The Court adopts Plaintiffs’ definition of \nIHO:  residential settings that are not provider controlled, and are purchased, rented, or \nbuilt with the intention of providing a home for a specific individual who has chosen that \nspecific setting.  (Id. at 9.)  The Court observes that the definition of IHO does not itself \nrequire that a Disability Waiver recipient actually rent or own their residence as \nDefendant contends, but simply states what an IHO is. \n3 \n\nPlaintiffs assert their claims on behalf of themselves and a Class of similarly \nsituated individuals.  (See id. ¶¶ 92-101.)  Plaintiffs assert that they and the Class “have a \ncommon remedy: modifications to Defendant’s residential service system to provide \nindividuals with choices and prevent needless segregation of individuals in segregated \nresidential settings.”  (Id. ¶ 101.)  Plaintiffs seek “access to Waiver services that will \nallow them to plan, explore options, and ultimately move out of their CFC facilities and \ninto the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.”  (Doc. No. 499 (“Pl. Memo.”) \nat 3-4 (citing Pl. Resp. to Interrog. at 266-269).)  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to remedy Defendants’ alleged violations of the law, attorney fees and \ncosts, and other relief deemed necessary to protect the rights of Plaintiffs and the Class.  \n(See Am. Compl. at Prayer for Relief ¶¶ 2-6.) \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that:  (1) Defendant is violating \nthe Medicaid Act by not providing services with reasonable promptness and violating \nPlaintiffs’ Constitutional and Medicaid due process rights; and (2) Defendant is violating \nthe ADA and RA by segregating Plaintiffs “while failing to provide them with \nindividualized housing services for which they are eligible.”  (Id. at Prayer for \nRelief ¶¶ 2-3.)   \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring Defendant to:  (1) “[p]romptly ensure \nevery Disability Waiver recipient living in a CRS facility receives notice about eligibility \nfor and access to individualized housing services, including person-centered planning;” \n(2) “[s]pecifically provide access and take prompt steps to make individualized housing \nservices, including person-centered planning, available to Plaintiffs in a reasonable \n4 \n\namount of time . . .”; and (3) “[t]ake such other steps as necessary to enable Plaintiffs to \nreceive residential services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs . . .”  \n(Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 4.)  Under items (2) and (3), above, Plaintiffs identify in detail \nthe proposed relief they seek to modify the state’s residential service system.  (Id. \nat Prayer for Relief ¶¶ 4(b)-4(c).)   \nDefendant contends that of the 45,438 Disability Waiver recipients in 2018, only \n31% lived in CFC facilities, and only 1.3% of those living in CFC facilities are putative \nclass members.6  (Def. Memo. at 9, 48.)  Accordingly, she argues that she is not over-\nrelying on CFC facilities, nor do her policies prevent individuals from moving to their \npreferred setting.  She further contends that her policies and practices comply with \nfederal law, and to the extent any alleged harm has occurred, she may not be held liable \nin her official capacity.   \nII.  Procedural History \n  Plaintiffs filed an initial complaint against Defendant and Minnesota Department \nof Human Services (“DHS) (collectively, “Defendants”) on August 3, 2016.  (Doc. \nNo. 1.)  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint on September 14, \n2016.  (Doc. No. 10.)  On May 18, 2017, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to \n \n6    Defendant further alleges that the proportion of Disability Waiver recipients who \nlive in CFC facilities has continued to decline since 2015.  (See Def. Memo. at 9.) \n5 \n\ndismiss insofar as it sought dismissal of DHS as a party and denied the motion in all other \nrespects.7  (May 2017 Order.) \nPlaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on February 23, 2017.  (Am. Compl.)  On \nFebruary 27, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.  (Doc. No. 35.)  On \nSeptember 29, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, certifying \nthe following class:  “All individuals age 18 and older who are eligible for and have \nreceived a Disability Waiver, live in a licensed Community Residential Setting, and have \nnot been given the choice and opportunity to reside in the most integrated residential \nsetting appropriate to their needs.”  (Doc. No. 99 at 35.)   \nOn November 15, 2018, Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on \nCount II of their Amended Complaint, asking the Court to declare that Defendant’s \ncurrent notice policy for Disability Waiver recipients violates federal law.  (See  Pl. \nMemo.)  On the same day, Defendant also moved for summary judgment, asking the \nCourt to grant summary judgment in her favor on all of Plaintiffs’ claims.  (See Def. \nMemo.)  Also on November 15, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to decertify the class \n(Doc. No. 418), and both parties moved to exclude expert testimony (Doc. Nos. 468, \n488).  The Court held a hearing on the motions on January 25, 2019.  (Doc. No. 623.)  \n \n7    Plaintiffs alleged that the Minnesota Department of Human Services (“DHS”) also \nviolated § 504 of the RA (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 126-32); however, the Court found that the \nsame claim against both DHS and the Commissioner of DHS in her official capacity was \nduplicative.  (May 2017 Order at 2.)  Accordingly, the Court dismissed DHS as a party \non May 18, 2017.  (Id. at 63.) \n6 \n\nThe Court delayed ruling on the motions pending settlement discussions that ultimately \nproved unsuccessful.  (Doc. No. 636.)   \nOn July 26, 2019, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to decertify the class.  \n(Doc. No. 640 (“July 2019 Order”).)  On August 6, 2019, Defendants requested \npermission for leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the July 2019 Order.  \n(Doc. No. 642 (“Request”).)  The Court denied Defendant’s Request on August 14, 2019.  \n(Doc. No. 646.)   \nOn August 7, 2019, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to exclude the expert \ntestimony of John Patterson, and denied Defendant’s motion to exclude the expert \ntestimony of David Michael Mank, Ph.D., and Dennis F. Price.  (Doc. No. 644.)   \nThe Court now considers Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment (Doc. \nNo. 495) and Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (Doc. No. 480).  \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Legal Standard \n  Summary judgment is appropriate if the “movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  Courts must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the \nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Weitz Co., LLC v. Lloyd’s of London, 574 \nF.3d 885, 892 (8th Cir. 2009).  However, “[s]ummary judgment procedure is properly \nregarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the \nFederal Rules as a whole, which are designed ‘to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive \n7 \n\ndetermination of every action.’”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 (1986) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1).  \n  The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Enter. Bank v. Magna \nBank of Mo., 92 F.3d 743, 747 (8th Cir. 1996).  The nonmoving party must demonstrate \nthe existence of specific facts in the record that create a genuine issue for trial.  Krenik v. \nCty. of Le Sueur, 47 F.3d 953, 957 (8th Cir. 1995).  A party opposing a properly \nsupported motion for summary judgment “may not rest upon mere allegation or denials \nof his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986).  \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nPlaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on Count II of their Amended \nComplaint and ask the Court to declare that Defendant’s current notice policy for \nDisability Waiver recipients violates federal law.  (Pl. Memo. at 2.)  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant’s policy violates their due process rights under both the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the Medicaid Act’s fair hearing \nrequirements.   \nPlaintiffs argue that federal law requires Defendant to provide a legally sufficient \nwritten notice (“Notice of Action”) to Disability Waiver recipients when Defendant \ndenies access to Waiver Services or fails to act on a request for Waiver Services with \n8 \n\nreasonable promptness.8  (Id. at 13-16.)  Plaintiffs claim that while Defendant has a \nformal written policy that instructs Lead Agencies to send a Notice of Action Form “each \ntime [the case manager/planer] takes action in the support plan that denies, terminates, or \nreduces the person’s service,” the policy does not explain what constitutes an action that \ndenies, terminates, or reduces the person’s service, nor does it set forth any instructions \nthat must be sent if a request for services is not acted upon within a certain timeline or \nwith reasonable promptness.  (Schmidt Aff. 1 ¶ 7, Doc. No. 503-1, Ex. 6 (“Notice of \nAction Policy”) at 288.)  Plaintiffs contend that because “Defendant has not provided a \nclear and objective standard to the Lead Agencies that she is legally obligated to direct, \nthe denial process has been handled inconsistently and unlawfully throughout the State.”  \n(Pl. Memo. at 8.)   \nPlaintiffs argue that under Defendant’s current policy, Lead Agencies are only \nrequired to provide a Notice of Action when they have made a formal, final decision that \nthey will not authorize specific Disability Waiver services and that no Notice of Action is \nrequired while the Lead Agency purportedly attempts to assist Disability Waiver \nrecipients in some way with their request for services, regardless of how long their \nattempt lasts.  (See id. at 12.)  Citing Black’s Law Dictionary, Plaintiffs argue that every \ntime Lead Agencies deprive or withhold individualized housing services from a \nDisability Waiver recipient, or fail to act on a request in a reasonably prompt manner, the \nservices are effectively “denied” and Notice of Action is required.  (Id. at 15-16.)   \n \n8    A Notice of Action complies with the requirements set forth in 42 C.F.R. § \n431.210.  See 42 C.F.R. § 431.210 (detailing required content of notice). \n9 \n\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant’s amorphous policy leaves the decision of what \nconstitutes a “denial” entirely within the discretion of individual Lead Agencies, and that \nDefendant’s lack of guidance causes Lead Agencies to believe they are not required to \nprovide Notice of Action as long as they think that they are working on a Disability \nWaiver recipient’s case and believe that progress is being made.  (Id. at 18.)   \nPlaintiffs argue that the practical effect of Defendant’s policy is that Plaintiffs go \nmonths and sometimes years without services or explanatory notice of a denial in \nviolation of their federal rights.9  (Id. at 12-14; 19-29.)   \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to direct Defendant to issue a new policy that requires a \ntimely, written Notice of Action to be issued whenever a Lead Agency denies any \nindividualized housing services or fails to act on a request for individualized housing \nservices with reasonable promptness.  (Id. at 2.)   \nDefendant first contends that Plaintiffs’ claim for violation of the Medicaid Act \nmust be denied because the Medicaid Act contains no private right of action.10  (Doc. \nNo. 550 (“(Def. Opp.”) at 14-15.)  Defendant relies on Does v. Gillespie, 867 F.3d 1034 \n(8th Cir. 2017), to argue that “nothing short of an unambiguously conferred right will \n \n9  In relevant part, 42 C.F.R. § 431.206(c) requires that a Notice of Action be \nprovided at the time:  (1) an individual applies for Medicaid; and (2) the agency denies an \nindividual’s claim for eligibility, benefits or services; or denies a request for exemption \nfrom mandatory enrollment in an Alternative Benefit Plan; or takes other action, and \ndefined at § 431.201; or whenever a hearing is otherwise required in accordance with \n§ 431.220(a).  The parties dispute Defendant’s compliance with § 431.206(c)(2). \n \n10    Defendant incorporates the argument in her motion for summary judgment that \nthere is no private right of action under the reasonable promptness section of the \nMedicaid Act.  (Def. Opp. at 15; see also Def. Memo. at 30-31).) \n10 \n\nsupport a cause of action under § 1983,” and that the Medicaid Act is “phrased as a \ndirective to the federal agency charged with approving state Medicaid plans, not as a \nconferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries of the State’s decision to participate in \nMedicaid.”11  (Doc. No. 482 (“Def. Memo.”) at 31 (citing Does, 867 F.3d at 1040-41).)  \nDefendant further contends that Congress did not intend to create a private right “because \nother sections of the [Medicaid] Act provide mechanisms to enforce the State’s obligation \nunder § 23(A),”  and “statues with an ‘aggregate’ focus do not give rise to individual \nrights.”  (Id. (citing Does, 867 F.3d at 1041-42).)  \nDefendant next argues that even if the Medicaid Act was privately enforceable, \nher policies comply.  (Def. Opp. at 15.)  Defendant contends that the plain language of \nthe Medicaid Act requires only that an opportunity for a fair hearing must exist and that \nshe provides such an opportunity through routine notices about the right to appeal.12  (Id. \nat 1, 14-15.)   \n \n11  Does specifically addressed § 1396a(a)(23)(A), the “free choice provision,” of the \nMedicaid Act.  See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(A). \n \n12  Defendant contends that she provides notice about the opportunity for a fair \nhearing when a Disability Waiver recipient is initially assessed or reassessed for service \neligibility, and when an action is taken in the recipient’s support plan that denies, \nterminates, or reduces the recipient’s services.  (Def. Opp. at 5.)  She cites the following \nforms:  (1) DHS-1941-ENG, entitled  “Your Appeal Rights” which states that “if you \nhave applied for or are getting financial help, medical coverage or social services through \nthe county or state agency,” “you can appeal” if, among other things, “[t]he agency does \nnot act quickly enough and you think it has gone beyond the legal time limit to act,” \n“[t]he agency decides you cannot get help,” “[t]he agency providing you with assistance \nor services reduces or stops them,” “[t]he agency denies you a specific medical service,”  \n(Footnote continued on next page.)  \n \n \n11 \n\nDefendant contends that Plaintiffs misinterpret the notice requirements imposed  \nby § 431.206(c)(2) of the Medicaid Act by using an improper definition of “denial,” and \nfor failing to recognize that short of denial, Notice of Action is only available to \nindividuals who specifically ask for it.  (Id. at  15-20.)   \nDefendant disputes Plaintiffs’ definition of “denial” and contends that pursuant to \nthe Medicaid Act, “[Notice of Action] is triggered by an objectively verifiable, decisional \nevent: ‘[a]t the time the agency denies an individual’s claim for eligibility, benefits or \nservices.’”  (Id. at 17 (citing 42. C.F.R. § 431.206(c)(2)).)  Defendant argues that a \n“claim” for “medical assistance” requires an individual to “make[] application for \nassistance.”  (Id.)  Accordingly, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs rely on an “an \ninapposite, freestanding concept of ‘denial’ unconnected to a ‘claim,’” so no denial \nactually occurs when a simple request for services is deprived, withheld, or not acted \nupon in a reasonable amount of time.  (See id at 17-19.)   \nDefendant further contends that short of a denial, the plain language in 42 C.F.R. \n431.220(a)(1) triggers Notice of Action only upon specific request for a hearing by an \n \n(Footnote continued from previous page.) \nor “you disagree with these and other county or state agency actions;” (2) DHS-2727-\nEng, entitled “Long-Term Services and Supports Assessment and Program Information \nand Signature Sheet,” which asks whether the assessed person understands that they have \nthe right to appeal a decision that results in a denial, termination, or reduction in services; \n(3) DHS-6791B-ENG, entitled “Community Support Plan with the Coordinated Services \nand Supports Plan,” which includes the statement “[i]f you are dissatisfied with the \ncounty agency/tribe or managed care organization’s action, or feel they have failed to act \non [your] request for home and community based services, you have the right to appeal,” \nand sets forth appeal instructions; (4) DHS-6791D-ENG, entitled “Coordinate Services \nand Supports Plan Signature Sheet” which also includes appeal information.  (See Doc. \nNo. 553 (“Winter Decl.) ¶¶ 3-6, Exs. 2-5.) \n12 \n\nindividual who believes the agency has denied his or her claim for eligibility, covered \nbenefits or services, or has not acted upon the claim with reasonable promptness.  (Id. \nat 19-20 (citing 42 C.F.R. 431.220(a)(1)).)  Defendant argues that because Plaintiffs do \nnot complain of any rejection of, or failure to act upon, any application for a Disability \nWaiver service, Plaintiffs’ actual concern amounts to allegedly inadequate case manager \nperformance in response to a general request to explore moving, or external events \nallegedly inhibiting a request to move.  (Id. at 21-24.)   \nMoreover, Defendant contends that her policies already require notice of the right \nto challenge allegedly deficient case manager performance outside of the claim denial \ncontext so Disability Waiver recipients are not “left in limbo” as Plaintiffs contend.  (Id. \nat 25.)  Specifically, she contends that pursuant to Minn. R. 9525.0024, subp. 3, \nDisability Waiver recipients “must be informed—upon development of their required \nindividual service plan and at least annually thereafter—of their right to a conciliation \nconference under [Minn. Stat.] section  256.045.”  (Id. at 25.)   \nDefendant contends that because her policies comply with the Medicaid Act, any \nalleged procedural due process violation also fails.  (Id. at 27)  Moreover, Defendant \nargues that Plaintiffs do not have a property interest in any “individualized housing \nservice” not actually applied for, and that Plaintiffs do not identify any actual Disability \nWaiver service allegedly denied.  (Id. at 28)  She further contends that Plaintiffs do not \nhave a property interest in “a guarantee” that they will move in response to a request to \ndo so.  (Id. at 29.)  Notwithstanding, Defendant argues that the routine notice she \n13 \n\nprovides related to reasonable promptness and challenges to case manager performance \nsatisfies procedural due process.  (Id.) \nFinally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ requested injunction violates Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 65 as impossibly vague because Plaintiffs:  (1) do not identify which actual services \navailable under Defendant’s Waivers they believe qualify as “individualized housing \nservices,” leaving Defendant to guess whether a particular serviced allegedly denied is an \n“individualized housing service;” (2) do not explain how Defendant is to know when a \ncase manager’s assistance with an individual’s request for moving assistance is \nsufficiently delayed or deficient to constitute a deprivation or withhold; and (3) only \nrequest notice related to moves to “a more integrated setting” which is a highly \nindividualized determination.  (Id. at 33.)   \nThe Court first observes that it has already addressed Defendant’s argument that \nthe Medicaid Act does not provide a private right action.  (See May 2017 Order at 29.)  \nSpecifically, the Court concluded that the reasonable promptness and fair hearing \nprovisions are privately enforceable under § 1983 for eligible individuals.  (Id. at 22)  \nThe Court again incorporates and adopts its analysis and holding in Guggenberger v. \nMinnesota, 198 F. Supp. 3d 973, 1006-07, 1022 (D. Minn. 2016), and continues to find \nthat both §§ 1396a(a)(8) and 1396a(a)(3) are privately enforceable.13  Does does nothing \nto change the Court’s analysis.  As the Court previously stated, “[t]he enforceability of a \n \n13    As discussed in its May 2017 Order, many of the allegations and arguments \nspecific to the above entitled matter are similar to those previously considered by the \nCourt in Guggenberger.  See generally, Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d 973. \n14 \n\nparticular Medicaid Act must be independently assessed by the Court; the fact that one \nprovision fails to establish a private cause of action does not govern the enforceability of \na separate and distinct provision.”  Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d  at 1006.  Does \naddressed only § 23(A) of the Medicaid Act, the “freedom of choice” provision.  There, \nthe Eighth Circuit stated, “we see significant difficulties with the contention that § 23(a) \nunambiguously creates an enforceable federal right,” and ultimately concluded that it did \nnot.  Does, 867 F.3d at 1041, 1046.  Accordingly, Does has no impact on the Court’s \nholding that the “reasonable promptness” or “the fair hearing” provision of the Medicaid \nAct are privately enforceable.   \nThe Court next addresses Defendant’s interpretation of the Medicaid Act.  In \nshort, the Court finds Defendant’s narrow reading of the Medicaid Act overly restrictive.  \n42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(3) states, “[a] State plan for medical assistance must provide for \ngranting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose \nclaim for medical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable \npromptness.”  42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(3).  While Defendant contends that Notice of Action \nis trigged only when a specific application for eligibility, benefits, or services is denied, \nthis interpretation does not follow naturally from the plain language of the statute, nor \ndoes it comport with guidance from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services \n(“CMS”) which construes “claim” more broadly.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 86382-01, 86395.   \nCMS explains that a “‘claim’ in § 431.220(a)(1) . . . refers broadly to any claim by \nan applicant or beneficiary for Medicaid, whether such claim be for eligibility for \ncoverage in general, or for a particular benefit or service . . .”  81 Fed. Reg. 86382-01, \n15 \n\n86395.14  CMS also provides that “‘denial’ of a claim in § 431.220(a)(1) includes \nsituations in which the agency authorizes an amount, duration or scope of a service which \nis less than that requested by the beneficiary or provider.”  (Id.)  The CMS guidance does \nnot tie “claim” to a “specific application,” or to any specific service at all, nor does it \nlimit “denial” to simply rejecting an application.15 \nDefendant’s interpretation is also illogical; it presupposes that Disability Waiver \nrecipients know exactly what services are available and to specifically apply for them \nbefore due process requirements are triggered.  This “improperly places on the recipient \nthe burden of acquiring notice whereas due process directs [Defendant] to supply it.”  \nSchroeder v. Hegtsrom, 590 F. Supp. 121, 128 (D. Or. 1984) (citation omitted.)  Further, \nDefendant’s interpretation fails to comport with the purpose of the Medicaid Act to \n“provide medical benefits to those in greatest need.”  Hodson v. Bd. of Cty. Com’rs, \nHennepin Cty., 614 F.2d 601, 610 (8th Cir. 1980).  Contrary to Defendant’s assertions, \nthe Court finds that the practical effect of her interpretation is that Disability Waiver \n \n14  “Under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), an agency’s interpretation of its \nown regulations is ‘controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the \nregulation.’’’  Guggenberger v. Minnesota, 198 F. Supp. 3d 973, 1027 n.21 (D. Minn. \n2016).  The Court finds that the CMS guidance is neither erroneous nor inconsistent with \nits regulation. \n \n15  The CMS Medicare and Medicaid Statistical Supplement defines “claim” as “a \nrequest to a carrier, intermediary, Medicare Administrative Contractor, a State by a \nbeneficiary, or by a provider acting on behalf of a beneficiary for payment of benefits \nunder Medicare or Medicaid.”  (Winter Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. 30.)  Accordingly, this definition \nis not linked to a “specific application” either. \n16 \n\nrecipients could wait indefinitely for requested services, never receiving an explanation \non the status of the request, and without an opportunity to appeal.  \nThe Court finds that a denial under 42 C.F.R. § 431.206(c)(2) is not limited to \nrejection of an application for services; a denial also occurs—and a Notice of Action is \nrequired—when an agency does not authorize services that a beneficiary requests, and \nwhen an agency authorizes services but does not provide the type or amount of requested \nservices.  Pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 431.210, a notice required under § 431.206(c)(2) must \ncontain:  (1) a statement of what action the agency. . . intends to take and the effective \ndate of such action; (2) a clear statement of the specific reasons supporting the intended \naction; (3) the specific regulations that support, or the change in Federal or State law that \nrequires, the action; (4) an explanation of the individual’s right to request a local \nevidentiary hearing if one is available, or a State agency hearing; or in cases of an action \nbased on a change in state law, the circumstances under which a hearing will be granted; \nand (5) an explanation of the circumstances under which Medicaid is continued if a \nhearing is requested.  42 C.F.R. § 431.210.   \nThe Court has reviewed the forms that Defendant alleges satisfy the Medicaid Act \nfair hearing requirement.  While they do include several references to appeal, they lack \nthe components required pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 431.210.  Importantly, they fail to \noutline any reason for denial.  General information about appeal rights unrelated to a \nspecific request is insufficient.  See Daugherty v. Roob, Civ. No. 1:06-878, 2009 WL \n899771, at *7 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 31, 2009) (holding that explanatory documents and making \ncaseworkers available to answer questions “fail[ed] to address the due process \n17 \n\nrequirement that the applicable standard be set forth in . . . its denial notices.”).  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Defendant’s failure to provide proper notice violates the \nMedicaid Act’s notice and hearing requirements outlined in 42 C.F.R. § 431.210. \nAs the Court explained in its May 2017 Order, the Medicaid Act’s fair hearing \nrequirements “support and reinforce Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment Due Process \nClaim.”16  (May 2017 Order at 44.)  “The fundamental requirement of due process is the \nopportunity to be heard ‘at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.’” Mathews v. \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319 at 333 (quoting, in part, Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 \n(1965)).  The opportunity to be heard must be coupled with “notice reasonably \ncalculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of \nthe action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.”  Mullane v. Cent. \nHanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).  The requirements of notice and an \nopportunity to be heard are necessarily intertwined and dependent upon one another:  \n“Adequate notice is integral to the due process right to a fair hearing, for the ‘right to be \nheard has little reality or worth unless one is informed.’”  Bliek v. Palmer, 102 F.3d 1472, \n1475 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S. Ct. 652).  Accordingly, \nDefendant’s violation of the due process requirements under the Medicaid Act’s fair \nhearing requirements is coextensive with a procedural due process violation under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  See Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1022-23.  Both the \n \n16  The Court hereby adopts and incorporates its analysis and holding in its May 2017 \nOrder that the Medicaid Act’s fair hearing requirements are enforceable in a § 1983 claim \nby “any individual whose claim for medical assistance . . . is denied or is not acted upon \nwith reasonable promptness.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n18 \n\ntiming and content of Defendant’s routine notices fail to satisfy due process under the \nMedicaid Act, or under the Fourteenth Amendment.   \nWhile Defendant also contends that Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess claim fails because Plaintiffs do not have a protected property interest in a \n“guarantee[] that they will move in response to a request to do so,” (Def. Opp. at 29), the \nCourt finds that this interpretation of Plaintiffs’ requested relief misconstrues what they \nactually ask for.  (See Am. Compl. at 34-37.)  The Court has already concluded that \nPlaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the services they actually seek.  (May \n2017 Order at 40; see also Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp.3d at 1021 (“Plaintiffs have a \nlegitimate and important interest in the services they seek which would enable them to \nmore fully integrate into their communities and achieve independence in their lives like \nindividuals without disabilities.”).)  Nothing in discovery has altered the Court’s previous \nanalysis. \nFinally, the Court finds little merit in Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs’ \nrequested injunction violates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 as impossibly vague.  \nRule 65(d)(1) requires that every injunction must:  (1) state the reasons why it is issued; \n(2) state its terms specifically; and, (3) describe in reasonable detail—and not by referring \nto the complaint or other document—the act or acts restrained or required.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 65(d)(1).  Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief would enjoin Defendant to “issue a \nnew policy that requires that a timely, written Notice of Action form be issued whenever \na lead agency denies any individualized housing services or fails to act on a request for \nindividualized housing services with reasonable promptness.”  (Pl. Memo. at 2.)  The \n19 \n\nCourt finds Plaintiffs’ request is clear, straightforward, and consistent with how other \nstates operate their Medicaid appeal processes.  See, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 22 § 3181; \nArk. Code. Ann. § 20-77-121(b). \nNonetheless, the Court declines to grant an injunction at this time and encourages \nthe parties to confer and settle upon revisions to the policy that is sufficiently clear and \nmutually satisfactory.  To the extent the parties are unable to do so, the Court will require \nfurther evidence to determine the proper scope of the injunctive relief.   \nIn summary, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most \nfavorable to Defendant, the Court finds that Defendant’s policy violates Due Process \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act’s advance notice and fair \nhearing requirements, enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In lieu of issuing an injunction \nat this time, the Court encourages the parties to jointly settle upon revisions to the policy \nthat are mutually satisfactory.   \nB.  Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n1.  Standing and Mootness \nDefendant first argues that she is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs \nTenner Murphy, by his guardian Kay Murphy; (“Murphy”) Marrie Bottelson \n(“Bottelson”), and Dionne Swanson (“Swanson”) (collectively, “Named Plaintiffs”) lack \nstanding to bring their claims, and because Plaintiffs Murphy and Bottelson’s claims are \nmoot. \nSpecifically, Defendant contends that Named Plaintiffs have no evidence that any \nof the relief they request would remedy an injury they personally suffered, as opposed to \n20 \n\nallegedly affecting some unknown group of other people.  She argues that Plaintiffs \n“simply believe themselves to have ‘the status of being subject to a governmental \ninstitution that [i]s not organized or managed properly,’ which is insufficient for \nstanding.”  (Def. Memo. at 29 (citing Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 350 (1996)).)  She \nargues further that because Plaintiffs Murphy and Bottelson have moved to their desired \nsettings, their claims are moot.  (Id. at 29-30.) \nTo establish Constitutional Article III standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate:  \n(1) an injury-in-fact; (2) a causal connection between that injury and the challenged \nconduct; and (3) the likelihood that a favorable decision by the court will redress the \nalleged injury.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  These \nrequirements limit federal courts to deciding only cases where the plaintiffs can show a \n“personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely \nto be redressed by the requested relief.”  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984).  At \nthe summary judgment stage, plaintiffs “must ‘set’ forth’ by affidavit or other evidence \n‘specific facts’ which for the purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken as \ntrue.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  “While the proof required to establish standing increases \nas the suit proceeds, the standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking \njurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed.”  Davis v. Fed. \nElection Com’n, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008). \nWhen the Court found that Plaintiffs met the redressability requirement at the \npleading stage, the Court observed that “Plaintiffs must ultimately provide evidence to \nsupport their allegations relating to the effectiveness of individualized housing services in \n21 \n\nleading to greater integration in the community.”  (May 2017 Order at 24.)  The Court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have met their burden.  In addition to the expert reports and sworn \ntestimony of Plaintiffs’ experts Dr. David Mank and Dennis Price, Named Plaintiffs’ \nlived experiences indicate that effective individualized housing services leads to greater \ncommunity integration.  (See Doc. No. 310 (“Schmidt Aff. 2”) ¶ 5, 310-1, Ex. 4 (“Price \nReport”) at 57-75; Doc.  No. 498, Ex. 40 (“Dr. Mank Report”) at 23; Doc. No. 575 \n(“K. Murphy Decl.”) ¶¶ 7, 9-16, 19-21, 32-39); Doc. No. 576 (“Bottelson Decl.”) ¶¶ 8-\n13, 15-18, 21-23.)  Taking this evidence as true, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ continue \nto have proper standing.   \nDefendant also contends that Plaintiffs Murphy and Bottelson’s claims are moot \nbecause prospective injunctive relief is inappropriate when they have already moved to \ntheir desired settings and they cannot demonstrate that their claims are capable or \nrepetition.  (Def. Memo. at 30.)  The Court is unpersuaded.  First, this is a class action \ncertified under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  It is well-established that \n“mootness of the named plaintiff’s individual claim after a class has been duly certified \ndoes not render the action moot.”  U.S. Parole Com’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 \n(1980) (citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1980)).  The Supreme Court specifically \nstated that an Article III case or controversy “may exist . . . between a named defendant \nand a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff, even though the claim of \nthe named plaintiff has become moot.”  Sosna, 419 U.S. at 402.   \nHere, the record reflects that Plaintiffs Murphy and Bottelson did not move until \nafter the Class was certified, and that until they moved, their claims for systemic relief \n22 \n\nwere common to and typical of the members of the Class.  Notwithstanding, there is no \nevidence that Plaintiff Swanson’s claims are moot.  Accordingly, the Court declines to \ngrant Defendant’s motion for summary judgment on this basis.   \n2.    Reasonable Promptness (Count I) \nCount I of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nthrough failure to furnish services with reasonable promptness in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(8).  The reasonable promptness requirement provides that “[a] State plan for \nmedical assistance must . . . provide that all individuals wishing to make application for \nmedical assistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such \nassistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8).   \nPayment for home and community-based Disability Waiver services is deemed \n“medical assistance” under the Medicaid Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1).  Regulations \nalso require the State to establish time standards to determine an individual’s eligibility \nfor Medicaid in no more than ninety days and to “[f]urnish Medicaid promptly to \nbeneficiaries without any delay caused by the agency’s administrative procedures.”  See \n42 C.F.R. § 435.912; id. § 435.930; see also Doe ex rel. Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709, 717 \n(11th Cir. 1998); Boulet v. Cellucci, 107 F. Supp. 2d 61, 72-73 (D. Mass. 2000). \nDefendant first argues that she is entitled to summary judgment on Count I \nbecause there is no private right of action under the “reasonable promptness” provision in \nthe Medicaid Act.  (Def. Memo. at 30.)  For the reasons discussed in section I(A) above, \nthe Court has already held—and continues to hold—that the “reasonable promptness” \n23 \n\nprovision of the Medicaid Act is privately enforceable.  (See infra.)  Accordingly, the \nCourt declines to grant summary judgment on this basis.   \nDefendant next argues that even if there was a private right of action, Plaintiffs \ncannot meet the standard for official-capacity liability under § 1983 because any alleged \ninjury was inflicted solely by [her] employees or agents.  (Def. Memo. at 31.)   \nDefendant contends that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983 only \nwhen “execution of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.”  (Id. at 32 \n(citing Monell v. Dept’t. of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978)).)  \nDefendant argues that because Plaintiffs allege only that she has failed to require and \nensure that moving-related services are provided with reasonable promptness, and that \nthey otherwise have no evidence that Defendant knew of and condoned any alleged \ndeficiencies in the Disability Waiver service delivery, or that she has any policy \npreventing reasonably prompt service delivery, Plaintiffs’ official liability theory is \nforeclosed by Monell.  (Id. at 32.)  \n“To establish liability in an official-capacity suit under section 1983, a plaintiff \nmust show either that the official named in the suit took an action pursuant to an \nunconstitutional governmental policy, or that he or she possessed final authority over the \nsubject matter at issue and used that authority in an unconstitutional manner.”  Nix v. \nNorman, 879 F.2d 429, 433 (8th Cir. 1989) (internal citations omitted).  Here, Defendant \nhas “oversight authority and ultimate responsibility for administering the State’s \nMedicaid plan,” and “ultimate responsibility for the State’s provision of Waiver Services \nunder both federal Medicaid law and Minnesota statutes.”  Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. \n24 \n\n3d at 1034 (citing 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.10(b), 431.10(e), 435.903; Minn. Stat. §§ 256.01 \nsubd. 2(a); 256B.04, subd. 1; 256B.05, subd. 1).   \nDefendant contends that regardless of her final authority, she can cannot be held \nliable under § 1983 unless her policy was the “moving” force behind any alleged \nviolation.  (Doc. No. 609 (“Def. Reply”) at 5-6 (citing Burlison v. Springfield Pub. Sch., \n708 F. 3d 1034, 1041 (8th Cir. 2013).)  She contends that because “it is either undisputed \nor indisputable that Defendant requires waiver services to be provided both reasonably \nprompt services and multiple forms of notice,”  Plaintiffs’ claim that she “fails to ensure” \nthat her subordinates act accordingly cannot sustain an official-capacity claim.  (Id. at 6.)   \nAs discussed in section I(A) above, the Court finds that Defendant’s policy \nviolates federal law.  While the Court addressed the policy only with respect to the \nMedicaid Act’s fair hearing requirement, a similar analysis applies with respect to \nreasonable promptness.  Specifically, because the policy does not clearly define what \nconstitutes “denial,” the policy itself is potentially the moving force behind a failure to \nprovide Disability Waiver services with “reasonable promptness.”  Accordingly, the \nCourt finds that Defendant may be held liable in her official capacity. \n  Finally, Defendant argues that the Court should grant summary judgment in her \nfavor on Count I because Plaintiffs cannot prove that Disability Waiver services were not \nprovided with reasonable promptness.  (Def. Memo. at 32.)  Specifically, she contends \nthat:  (1) Plaintiff Bottelson admitted that she received all necessary services for her \nmove, her case manager responded to these requests reasonably promptly, and she has no \nevidence that any delay in moving was caused by Defendant’s administrative procedures; \n25 \n\n(2) Plaintiff Swanson never asked for a Disability Waiver service that was not provided \nquickly enough and has no evidence that her continued residence in a CFC is caused by \nDefendant’s administrative procedures; and, (3) Plaintiff Murphy has no evidence that \nany delay in moving was caused by Defendant’s administrative procedures, or that he \nfailed to receive any service quickly enough.  (Id.) \n  Plaintiffs refute these assertions and maintain that Defendant’s description of the \nfacts is “inaccurate, misleading, and ignores relevant pieces of the record.”  (Pl. Opp. \nat 36.)  Plaintiffs contend that Plaintiff Bottelson made clear that she was confused when \nshe responded to the question about whether she received all necessary services for her \nmove, and that she does not actually know if she received them.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs further \nallege that despite asking for services to help move as early as 2013, Plaintiff Bottelson \nwas unable to finalize her move until September 2018.  (Id.)  Similarly, Plaintiffs contend \nthat Plaintiff Swanson began asking to move in 2013 but remains in her CFC facility.  \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs also allege that Plaintiff Murphy did not receive any formal Disability \nWaiver service to help him move.  (Id.)  \n  As the Court previously recognized, “‘the question of reasonable promptness is a \ndifficult one,’ and many variables must be considered to evaluate whether a state is \nproviding needed Disability Waiver services in a reasonably prompt manner.”17  (May \n2017 Order at 33-34 (citing U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Services, Olmstead Update \n \n17    These variables include “[t]he urgency of an individual’s need, the health and \nwelfare concerns of the individual, the nature of the services required, the potential need \nto increase the supply of providers, [and] availability of similar or alternative services.”  \n(May 2017 Order at 34 (citing HHS Guidance at 6).) \n26 \n\nNo: 4, HCFA Update (Jan. 10, 2001) (“HHS Guidance”), available at Doc. No. 13-1 at \n36).)  Upon careful review of the record and consideration of each parties’ argument, the \nCourt finds that there are disputes over several key issues of material fact.  The Court \ncannot conclude as a matter of law whether Defendant’s Disability Waiver Services were \nprovided with reasonable promptness.  Accordingly, the Court declines to grant summary \njudgment on Count I of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. \n3.  Due Process (Count II) \nIn Count II of their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege a violation of their due  \nprocess rights under both the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the \nMedicaid Act’s fair hearing requirements.  As discussed above, the Court finds that \nDefendant’s policy violates Due Process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the \nMedicaid Act’s advance notice and fair hearing requirements, enforced under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983.18   \n4.  ADA & RA (Counts IV & V)) \nCounts III and IV of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint allege violations of Title II of \nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and § 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), respectively.  The \nCourt addresses Counts III and IV together, as the same analysis applies.  See Gorman v. \nBartch, 152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir.1998) (“The ADA . . . is [ ] similar in substance to the \n \n18  Because Defendant has final authority over the policy, and the policy is a moving \nforce behind federal due process violations, Defendant may be held liable in her official \ncapacity.  (See supra Section B(2).) \n27 \n\nRehabilitation Act, and cases interpreting either are applicable and interchangeable.” \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \nTitle II of the ADA, applicable to public entities, provides that “no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public \nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \nFurther, an implementing regulation referred to as the “integration mandate” states:  “A \npublic entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(d) (“Integration Mandate”).19  \nDefendant first argues that the Integration Mandate does not apply to individuals \nwho are not institutionalized or at risk of imminent institutionalization.  (Def. Memo. \nat 35-37.)  The Court again observes that it has already addressed this argument.  \nDefendant raises many of the same arguments that the Court previously considered and \nrejected.  In its May 2017 Order, the Court found that under Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. \nZimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), “[u]njustified isolation . . . is properly regarded as \ndiscrimination based on disability beyond the limited scope of institutionalization.”  (May \n \n19    The Rehabilitation Act includes similar provisions, including its own “integration \nmandate.”  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ”); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) \n(“Recipients shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.”).  \n28 \n\n2017 Order (citing Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d at 1026-28).)  The Court finds no \nreason to deviate from its prior holding.20 \nDefendant argues further that even if the Integration Mandate applied to \nintracommunity moves, it still does not require states to provide benefits ensuring \nhousing availability or moves to available housing.  (Def. Memo. at 37-40.)  She \ncontends that the plain language of the Integration Mandate requires only that a state \ncannot provide existing benefits in one setting but not another and that Olmstead \nexplicitly rejects “that the ADA imposes on the States a ‘standard of care’ for whatever \nmedical services they render, or that the ADA requires States to ‘provide a certain level \n \n20    The Court has thoughtfully considered the finding in Brown v. District of \nColumbia that plaintiffs did not have a valid Olmstead claim because “Olmstead drew the \nline between ‘institutions’ and ‘community settings’” and both group homes and private \nhomes were community settings.  928 F.3d 1070, 1087 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Recognizing \nthat the circuits are split on this issue, the Court respectfully disagrees with Brown on this \nissue.  The Court continues to agree with the Seventh Circuit’s analysis in Steimel v. \nWernet : \nOlmstead dealt only with the problem of unjustified institutional segregation.  Its \nrationale, however, reaches more broadly . . .  The Court had no occasion to \nconsider whether the same evils it had identified for institutional placements might \nexist in some settings outside of an institution.  This case presents that question: \nwhether isolation in the home for a person ‘who can handle and benefit from’ time \nout in the general community is also inconsistent with the integration mandate.  \nWe see no reason why the same analysis should not apply. \n823 F.3d 902, 910-11 (7th Cir. 2016).  The Seventh Circuit ultimately concluded the \nIntegration Mandate “bars unjustified segregation of persons with disabilities, wherever it \ntakes place.”  (Id.) \n29 \n\nof benefits to individuals with disabilities’” (Id. at 38 (citing Olmstead.)  She contends \nthat Plaintiffs require “a host of new programs, services, and benefit levels,” that are \nforeclosed by Olmstead and subsequent caselaw.  (Id. at 38-39.)   \nIn its May 2017 Order, the Court recognized that “[a]lthough states are not \nrequired to ‘provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities’ under \nOlmstead, they ‘must adhere to the ADA’s nondiscrimination requirement to the services \nthey in fact provide.’”  (May 2017 Order at 56 n. 8 (citing Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 \nn. 14).)  Other Courts have found that failing to provide existing services in a more \nintegrated setting is a violation of the ADA.  See, e.g., Steimel, 823 F.3d at 913 (finding \nthat a state violates the ADA when it refuses to provide an existing benefit to a disabled \nperson that would enable that individual to live in a more community-integrated setting); \nTownsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 517 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that “states could avoid \ncompliance with the ADA by characterizing services offered in one isolated location as a \nprogram distinct from the provision of the same services in an integrated location”). \nAfter a careful review of Plaintiffs’ requested relief, the Court finds that Plaintiffs \ndo not seek new services or a “certain level” of benefits.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief does not include the “requirement” that Plaintiffs actually move, but \nmodifications to Defendant’s current system that will increase their opportunity to move, \nwill, and access to Disability Waiver services if they do.  (See Doc. No. 291-1 at 61, 80-\n84, 155-159).)  “When a state’s policies discriminate against the disabled in violation of \nthe ADA, the ADA’s regulations mandate reasonable modifications to those policies in \norder to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, at least when such modification \n30 \n\nwould not fundamentally alter the nature of the services provided by the state.”  \nTownsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 517 (9th Cir. 2003).  As discussed below, the Court \ncannot conclude as a matter of law whether Plaintiffs’ requested modifications are \nreasonable; however, the request itself does not exceed the limits of the Integration \nMandate.21 \n  Defendant next argues that Plaintiffs ADA and RA claims fail because they cannot \nshow that their CFC facilities cause segregation.  (Def. Memo. at 40.)  Defendant \ncontends that the Integration Mandate should be construed narrowly and only relates to \nPlaintiffs’ opportunities to interact with non-disabled persons.  (Id. at 40 n.20.)  She \ncontends that while Plaintiffs may not like some things about their CFC facilities, they \nhave failed to show that anything unique about CFC facilities limits their ability to access \nthe community.22  (Id. at 40-41.)   \n  The Court first observes that Defendant’s narrow interpretation of the Integration \nMandate does not square with other statements she has made with respect to the \ndefinition of an integrated setting.  (See, e.g., Bartolic Dep. at 166 (stating that \n \n21    Defendant later argues that Plaintiffs’ request that she “ensure access” or provide \n“unlimited staffing” is an unlawful interpretation of the Integration Mandate.   (Def. \nMemo. at 43.)  This similarly misconstrues Plaintiffs’ requested relief.  Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief does not include “ensuring access” to IHOs or “unlimited staffing.”  The \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs’ request for modifications to Defendant’s existing Disability \nWaiver system fall within the scope of the Integration Mandate.   \n \n22    Defendant suggests that Named Plaintiffs’ integration-related complaints are \nactually just complaints over staff availability for community outings, TV-access, distaste \nfor housemates, and other aspects of CFC facilities they simply do not care for.  (Def. \nMemo. at 40 n.20.)   \n31 \n\ndetermining whether a setting is the most integrated is based on a number of factors, \nincluding whether a person has friendships and feels valued in the community); \nSchmidt Aff. 3 ¶ 35, Doc. No. 578-2, Ex. 34 at 171 (defining an integrated settings as \n“settings that provide people the opportunity to live, work and receive services in the \ngreater community,” that “offer access to community activities when and with whom the \nperson chooses,” and “offer people choices in daily life activities and encourage \ninteraction with people who do not have disabilities . . .”).)  Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Mank \nalso provides a broader definition of the Integration Mandate:  “[I]ntegration is about \nmaking informed and free choices about with whom one lives and about where and with \nwhom one spends their time,” and “means that an individual is a part of the community \nrather than simply in the community.”  (Dr. Mank Report at 11 (emphasis in original).)  \n  Even if the Court were to accept Defendant’s narrow interpretation of the \nIntegration Mandate, the Court finds that there are disputes over issues of material fact \nwith respect to whether CFC facilities actually enable individuals to interact with non-\ndisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.  (See, e.g., Dr. Mank Report at 15-16; K. \nMurphy Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9-16, 19-21, 32-39; Bottelson Decl. ¶¶ 8-13, 15-18, 21-23.)  While \nDefendant suggests that Plaintiffs’ complaints about CFC facilities do not relate to their \nability to interact with non-disabled persons, Plaintiffs’ evidence conveys isolation, \nlimited choice, and lesser quality of life in CFC facilities as compared to IHOs. \nAccordingly, disputes of material fact regarding the level of integration at CFC facilities \nprecludes summary judgment on this issue.   \n32 \n\n  Defendant next argues that Plaintiffs ADA and RA claims fail because Plaintiffs \ndo not have evidence that Defendant prevented them from moving, or from moving \nsooner.  (Def. Memo. at 41-43.)  She cites other reasons for why Named Plaintiffs failed \nto move or did not move sooner.  (Id.) \nThe Court is unpersuaded.  Plaintiffs need not show that Defendant was the “but-\nfor” cause of their failure to move, or from failing to move sooner.  Indeed, numerous \nissues outside of Defendant’s control ultimately impact Plaintiffs’ ability to move.  \nPlaintiffs need only show that Defendant’s conduct was a substantial cause in Plaintiffs’ \nability to move.  See Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 278 (2d Cir. 2003) \n(finding that “the existence of additional factors causing an injury does not necessarily \nnegate the fact that defendant’s wrong is also the legal cause of the injury”); see also \nM.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 730 (9th Cir. 2012) (finding that plaintiff was not required \nto show that a state regulation was “the exclusive cause of her injury”).   \nThe determination as to whether Defendant’s conduct is a substantial cause of \nPlaintiffs’ inability to obtain Disability Waiver services necessary to live in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs is a fact intensive inquiry.  Here, the record \nreflects multiple disputes of material fact, including Defendant’s policies and \nmanagement of the Disability Waiver program, that prevent the Court from concluding as \na matter of law whether or not Defendant’s conduct is a substantial cause.23  \n \n23  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that Defendant’s use of the MnCHOICES \nAssessment, the Person Center, Informed Choice and Transition Protocol, and the LAR \nprocess have been a substantial cause of Plaintiffs’ inability to receive services.  (Pl. Opp. \nat 54.)   \n33 \n\nSimilarly, Defendant argues that even if Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims are \ncognizable, Plaintiffs have failed to request a reasonable modification because they lack \nproof that the accommodations they request would cause Named Plaintiffs to move—or  \nto have moved sooner.  (Def. Memo. at 43.)  Accordingly, Defendant argues that \nPlaintiffs have failed to show that their request is necessary to avoid discrimination on the \nbasis of disability.  (Id. at 44.)   \nAgain, Plaintiffs need not show that their requested accommodation will overcome \nevery single barrier Plaintiffs face in moving.  See Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 279.  It is \nsufficient that Plaintiffs’ requested accommodation will lead only to an increased \nopportunity to move.  Id.; see also Brown, 928 F.3d 1082.  Notwithstanding, as discussed \nabove, there are disputes of material fact regarding whether Named Plaintiffs would have \nmoved, or would have moved sooner, if their request was implemented.  Accordingly, the \nCourt cannot grant summary judgment on these issues. \nDefendant next argues that the State’s Olmstead Plan (“Plan”) is a complete \ndefense to Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims.  (Def. Memo. at 44-46.)  Defendant contends \nthat it would be unjust for the Court to find that she may have discriminated against \nPlaintiffs by implementing a comprehensive and effective Plan that the Court helped to \ndevelop, and continues to oversee.  (Id. at 46.)  She also contends that it would be a \nfundamental alteration to the Integration Mandate.  (Id.).   \nIn Olmstead, the Supreme Court held that a state may successfully assert a \nfundamental alteration defense to an Integration Mandate if it could demonstrate that it \nhad “a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental \n34 \n\ndisabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace.”  \nOlmstead,  527 U.S at 605-606.  While it is Plaintiffs’ burden to establish that the \nmodifications they seek are reasonable, it is Defendant’s burden to establish whether any \nreasonable modifications fundamentally alter the nature of the services she provides.  See \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); see also Gorman, 152 F.3d at 912 (describing the fundamental \nalteration argument as an affirmative defense).   \nDefendant argues that her Plan is both comprehensive and effective because:  \n(1) the Court found that the Plan complies with Olmstead approved and approved it in \n2015; and (2) the Plan includes goals related to the relief Plaintiffs’ seek and she is \nmeeting or exceeding those goals.24  (Def. Memo. at 6-7, 45-46.)   \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendant’s plan is neither comprehensive nor effectively \nworking.  (Pl. Opp. at 57-59.)  Plaintiffs cite their expert’s report to contend that the Plan \nis not comprehensive because:  (1) Defendant fails to track individual moves from CFC \nfacilities to IHOs; and (2) the Plan fails to include concrete and reliable commitments to \nfill existing services gaps necessary to ensure that individuals can move to more \nintegrated IHO settings.  (Id. at 58 (citing Price Report at 26-39).)  Plaintiffs further \ncontend that because DHS employees are unfamiliar with aspects of the Plan, and \n \n24  Defendant cites “Transition Services Goal One” that targets moves “from \nsegregated to more integrated settings” and “Housing and Services Goal One” that targets \n“the number of people with disabilities who live in the most integrated housing of their \nchoice where they have a signed lease and receive financial support.”  (Def. Memo. \nat 44.)  Defendant states that she met 98% of the Housing Services “stretch” goal in 2017, \nand expected to meet 96% of the “stretch” goal in 2018.  (Id. at 7.)  She also states that \nher Transition Services Goals are on track.  (Id.) \n35 \n\nbecause “housing” was one of the top three service gaps identified by Lead Agencies in \n2017, there are questions as to whether the Plan is truly effective.  (Id. at 58-59.) \nTo the extent that Defendant argues it would be “unjust” for the Court to find that \nthe Plan the Court approved is no longer comprehensive or effective, the Court reiterates \nthat merely implementing an Olmstead Plan is not a bar to Plaintiffs’ claims, or any other \nfuture claims, that the Plan fails to provide a complete solution to the harms they assert.  \nSee, e.g., Guggenberger, 198 F. Supp. 3d  at 1031.  As only time and lived experience \ncan reveal, an Olmstead Plan at one point deemed comprehensive and effective may \nprove otherwise over time. \nNotwithstanding, the Court acknowledges and commends the progress that \nDefendant has made towards meeting the goals in its Plan.  While this is laudable, \nwhether Defendant’s Plan is sufficiently comprehensive or effectively working such that \nit serves as a total defense to Plaintiffs’ claims is a fact intensive inquiry that the Court \ncannot resolve as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs have raised questions of material fact over \nthe content and implementation of the Plan.  While Defendant disagrees with Plaintiffs’ \nexpert, and argues that her data should speak for itself, these are the very disputes that \npreclude summary judgment.   \nIn short, despite Defendant’s various arguments about the interpretation, \nrequirements, and exceptions to the Integration Mandate, the Court declines to grant \nsummary judgment in her favor on Counts IV or V.   \n36 \n\n5.  Permissibility of Requested Relief \nFinally, Defendant contends that the relief Plaintiffs seek is impermissible because \nit would not solve any integration issue, and even if it did, Plaintiffs cannot prove that \nany integration issue is widespread.  (Def. Memo. at 47-49.)  \nDefendant first argues that because only one of Plaintiffs’ experts opined that \nPlaintiffs’ requested relief would have some aggregate effect, and that both of their \nexperts conceded that a person may be segregated in any setting, the redesign of her \nDisability Waiver system that Plaintiffs propose would not solve any integration issue.  \n(Id.at 47.)  Plaintiffs again cite the Price Report and Defendant’s own statements to raise \nquestions of material fact with respect to whether their request for relief would remedy \ntheir perceived flaws and inefficiencies of Defendant’s services.  (Pl. Opp. at 61-62.)   \nAs set forth above, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law whether the relief \nPlaintiffs seeks is reasonable because there are disputes over whether Plaintiffs would \nhave moved, or would have moved sooner, if the modifications they seek to Defendant’s \nDisability Waiver system were implemented.  Whether or not Plaintiffs’ request is \npermissible is derivative of whether it is reasonable.  Accordingly, the same disputes over \nmaterial fact that preclude summary judgment on whether Plaintiffs’ requested relief is \nreasonable also preclude summary judgment on whether it is permissible. \nDefendant next argues that even if Plaintiffs’ relief could provide a remedy, \nPlaintiffs have no evidence that the State’s Disability Waiver Recipients do not live in the \nmost integrated setting on a widespread basis.  She argues that “a class seeking systemic \nrelief must show violations are ‘widespread enough to justify systemwide relief.’”  (Def. \n37 \n\nMemo. at 47 (citing Lewis, 518 U.S. at 359).)  She alleges that “there must be proof that \nthe law has been violated as to all persons subject to the challenged system, not just \ngeneral allegations some unknown persons may have been harmed.”  (Id. at 48.)  \nDefendant alleges that Plaintiff cannot meet this burden because after 18 months of \ndiscovery, Plaintiffs can only prove that 0.4% of the State’s Disability Waiver population \nand only 1.3% of the its CFC population are allegedly harmed by any alleged violation.  \n(See id. at 8-9, 47 (citing Lewis, 518 U.S. at 360).)  Accordingly, Defendant argues that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are meritless because they are little more than a “vague allegation that \nany nonzero error rate at a system level entitles a litigant to a wholesale redesign of that \nsystem.”  (Id. at 48.)  Defendant further contends that requiring such a wholesale redesign \nof her Disability Waiver System would render her system subject to “judicial takeover.”  \n(Id. at 49.)  \n  Despite Defendant’s reliance on Lewis, Plaintiffs argue that the Lewis decision \ndoes not stand for the proposition that there must be proof that the law has been violated \nas to all persons in a challenged system in order to obtain relief.  (Pl. Opp. at 63.)  \nPlaintiffs contend that if such a requirement did exist, it would mean that the numerosity \nrequirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) would require classes to contain every single person \nin the challenged system.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s position is \nincorrect and unsupported.  (Id.) \n  With respect to injury, the relevant inquiry before the Court is how many people \nmust suffer alleged harm to require systemwide relief?  Defendant argues that 1.3%, or \n192 individuals, of the 13,971 Disability Waiver recipients living in CFC facilities is not \n38 \n\nenough.  In Lewis, the United States Supreme Court concluded that “two instances [of \nalleged injury in a state’s entire population of prisoners] were a patently inadequate basis \nfor conclusion of systemwide violation and imposition of systemwide relief.”  Lewis, 518 \nU.S. at 359.  Indeed, the Supreme Court found that “granting a remedy beyond what was \nnecessary to provide relief to two individuals was improper.”  Id. at 360. \n  Here, there are purportedly nearly 192 human beings who have suffered alleged \nharm resulting from Defendant’s policies and practices.  While a systemwide remedy \nmay not be necessary to provide relief to two individuals, it surely is when it has the \npotential to improve the lives of at least 200 of the State’s most marginalized citizens.  \nThis finding is not one of “judicial takeover” but a recognition that a large number of \nactual people have allegedly suffered actual harm caused by Defendant.  A systemwide \nremedy is the only way to provide relief.  Accordingly, the Court declines to grant \nsummary judgment on this basis. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court grants in part and denies in part \nPlaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment.  The Court finds that Defendant’s \npolicy violates Due Process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid \nAct’s advance notice and fair hearing requirements, enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \nThis being said, the Court declines to issue an injunction at this time.  The Court \nencourages the parties to jointly establish revisions to the policy that are mutually \nsatisfactory. \n39 \n\nWith respect to Defendant’s motion, the Court finds that disputes over issues of \nmaterial fact preclude summary judgment.  Notwithstanding, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs continue to have standing, their claims are not moot, Defendant may be held \nliable in her official capacity, and Plaintiffs’ alleged injury is sufficiently widespread to \njustify widespread relief.  \nThe Court is mindful that the parties worked diligently to reach a settlement \nagreement prior to its rulings.  The Court hopes that the parties may now redouble their \nefforts, as continued litigation will do little to serve the interests of either party.  \nORDER \nAccordingly, based on the files, records, and proceedings herein, and for the \nreasons set forth above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. [495]) is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows: \na.  Defendant’s policy violates Due Process rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and the Medicaid Act’s advance notice and fair hearing requirements, \nenforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \nb.  In lieu of granting an injunction at this time, the Court encourages \nthe parties to jointly establish revisions to Defendant’s policy that are sufficiently \nclear and mutually agreeable. \n2.  Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. [480]) is DENIED.  \n \nDated:  September 27, 2019    /sDonovan W. Frank \n            DONOVAN W.
