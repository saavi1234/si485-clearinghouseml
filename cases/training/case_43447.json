    "summary": "<p>On June 28, 2022, four days after the U.S. Supreme Court decided <a href=\"../../../../case/43153/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Dobbs</em></a>, the North Dakota Attorney General certified two state laws that banned nearly all abortions. These laws, N.D.C.C. &sect; 12.1-31-12 and &sect; 14-02.1-04.2, were originally enacted by the state legislature in 2007 under House Bill 1466 (&ldquo;H.B. 1466&rdquo; or \"Abortion Ban\"). Believing that Dobbs satisfied H.B. 1466&rsquo;s trigger, the Attorney General declared that the ban would take effect one month later on July 28.</p>\r\n<p>In response, the Red River Women's Clinic, the only remaining abortion provider in North Dakota, and its medical director sought to block enforcement of the ban. Plaintiffs brought two claims in their July 6 complaint: First, Plaintiffs challenged the entirety of the abortion ban on state constitutional due progress grounds. Second Plaintiffs argued that the Attorney General did not have the legal authority to certify that Dobbs had triggered the effective date of North Dakota&rsquo;s abortion ban because the Supreme Court had not yet formally issued a certified judgment. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and were represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights and private counsel. The complaint was filed in the South Central Judicial District of North Carolina.</p>\r\n<p>Just a few weeks later, on July 27, 2022, Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick granted Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction, concluding that the Attorney General had prematurely attempted to execute the triggering language since the Supreme Court had not yet issued its judgment, as required by the Abortion Ban. That is, the Attorney General&rsquo;s certification was improper until the Supreme Court issued its certified judgment on July 26, 2022. The Court did not consider the merits of the state constitutional claims.</p>\r\n<p>On August 25, 2022, Judge Romanick then granted a preliminary injunction. In this decision, the Court made no findings toward the substantial probability of success on the merits, reserving such analysis for a motion on summary judgment or a trial. Instead, the Court based its decision to grant the preliminary injunction on the fact that if the Abortion Ban went into effect, it would cause irreparable harm to North Dakotans that outweighed any harm that delaying its enforcement would have on the state. Acknowledging that the clinic had set up a facility across the border in Minnesota in anticipation of being forced to shut down in North Dakota once the law took effect, Judge Romanick stated that the abortion ban would nevertheless &ldquo;implicate others, including physicians at regional hospitals if it were to go into effect.&rdquo; On September 23, Judge Romanick upheld the injunction, against the State's request to lift the stay.</p>\r\n<p>On October 11, 2022 the North Dakota Supreme Court ordered Judge Romanick to weigh the clinic's chances of success and reconsider his earlier decision. On November 1, Judge Romanick again upheld the ban, concluding that the ban likely violated the state constitution because the trigger law would fail even rational basis review as it is not rationally related to North Dakota's stated goal of protecting human life, given that it increases risks for pregnant people.</p>\r\n<p>Following this decision, the Attorney General argued that Judge Romanick improperly applied injunction standards and abused his discretion. Defendant also sought a supervisory writ&mdash;a supervisory writ is a purely discretionary procedural device used to correct errors and prevent injustices in unusual circumstances when no alternative would work&mdash;from the North Dakota Supreme Court. Plaintiffs argued that a supervisory writ would not be appropriate, because Defendant had not produced evidence to demonstrate an immediate risk of harm. On November 29, 2022, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the matter.</p>\r\n<p>On March 16, 2023, the North Dakota Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by Chief Justice Jensen, denied the Attorney General's requested relief and upheld the preliminary injunction. 988 N.W.2d 231. The Supreme Court agreed with Defendant that it would have had jurisdiction to overturn the temporary injunction if it thought the argument for overturning had merit. However, the Supreme Court did not think the argument had merit, and instead sided with Plaintiffs in deciding that preliminary enjoining the Abortion Ban (a) posed no irreparable harm, (b) posed no sufficient harm to interested parties, (c) was in the public interest, and (d) consistent with the North Dakota Constitution's guarantee of a fundamental right to abortion.</p>\r\n<p>The March 16 declaration of a fundamental right to abortion was significant, especially because no North Dakota court had decided this previously. To reach this conclusion, the North Dakota Supreme Court relied on other states' constitutions and court rulings, plus history and tradition. The decision was also significant because it meant abortion restrictions and bans would be subject to strict scrutiny, a more stringent standard than the deferential rational basis standard previously applied by Judge Romanick. Strict scrutiny is a standard that overturns most government policies interfering with constitutional rights. Therefore, the Supreme Court predicted, pending a future merits evidentiary record, that the Abortion Ban would not be able to pass strict scrutiny and would lose on the merits. Therefore, the North Dakota Supreme Court held that the preliminary injunction should stay in place.</p>\r\n<p>In April 2023, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum signed into law a near-total abortion ban. Senate Bill 2150 (&ldquo;S.B. 2150&rdquo;) replaced the state&rsquo;s trigger ban and outlined narrow exceptions, including cases of ectopic or molar pregnancy, cases where the life of the mother is endangered, and cases where a pregnancy that results from rape or incest is discovered in the first six weeks of pregnancy. In response, Plaintiffs requested leave to file an amended complaint on June 12, 2023, alleging that the new ban still violated the North Dakota Constitution. Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that S.B. 2150 violated due process, was void for vagueness, and violated their patients&rsquo; rights to life and safety. The court granted the motion, and the amended complaint was filed on August 15, 2023. Through the amended complaint, several physicians licensed in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On November 21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, seeking to prohibit enforcement of the abortion ban against physicians who exercised their good-faith medical judgment in performing an abortion to preserve a pregnant person's life or health. The statute contained an exception in the case of a physician's reasonable medical judgment.</p>\r\n<p>The next month, on December 20, a hearing was held before the trial court on Plaintiffs' motion, and, on January 23, 2024, Judge Romanick denied the motion. Noting that Plaintiffs' request was unusual, in that it requested the enjoinment of the statute only in certain circumstances, Judge Romanick found Plaintiffs had offered no legal authority that would grant the court authority to alter the abortion ban's exception from \"reasonable medical judgment\" to \"good faith medical judgment.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and a hearing was held on the motion on July 23, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>A trial had previously been scheduled for August 26-30, 2024. On July 29, 2024, Judge Romanick cancelled the trial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 12, 2024 Judge Romanick denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment and held not only was the ban unconstitutionally vague, the North Dakota constitution creates a fundamental right to access abortion before viability.</p>\r\n<p>Concerning the ban, Judge Romanick identified two parts of the statute that made it unconstitutionally vague. First, the medical exemption in the statute contained both objective and subjective elements: respectively, the abortion had be deemed necessary based on \"reasonable medical judgement\" and be &nbsp;\"intended to prevent death or a serious health risk to the pregnant female.\" Judge Romanick held that this made it impossible for a physician to know under which standard her conduct would be judged, thus violating due process rights. Secondly, the ban had an exception for rape or abuse, if the physician determined based on reasonable medical judgment that rape, abuse or incest had occurred. Judge Romanick held that physicians had no way to accurately determine whether such crimes had occurred and, again, would be forced to guess whether the exception applied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Next, Judge Romanick held article 1, section 1 of the state constitution guarantees individuals the fundamental rights to make medical judgments about their bodily integrity, health and autonomy, without government interference. This includes protecting a person's right to get a pre-viability abortion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of September 12, 2024, the case is ongoing.</p>",

Romanick \nNo. 20220260 \nJensen, Chief Justice. \n[¶1]  North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, on behalf of the State of \nNorth Dakota (“the State”), seeks a supervisory writ to vacate the district \ncourt’s  order  granting  a  preliminary  injunction  enjoining  enforcement  of \nN.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12. The injunction was granted in Access Indep. Health \nServs., Inc., et al. v. Drew H. Wrigley, et al., Burleigh Co. Court No. 2022-CV-\n01608. The State argues the district court abused its discretion in granting the \ninjunction because Access Independent Health Services, Inc., d/b/a Red River \nWomen’s Clinic (“RRWC”) and the other plaintiffs failed to prove (1) they have \na substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) they will suffer irreparable \ninjury, (3) there will be harm to other interested parties, and (4) the effect on \nthe public interest weighs in favor of granting a preliminary injunction. While \nthe regulation of abortion is within the authority of the legislature under the \nNorth Dakota Constitution, RRWC has demonstrated likely success on the \nmerits that there is a fundamental right to an abortion in the limited instances \nof  life-saving  and  health-preserving  circumstances,  and  the  statute  is  not \nnarrowly tailored to satisfy strict scrutiny. We grant the requested review, deny \nthe relief requested in the petition, and leave in place the order granting a \npreliminary injunction. \nI  \n[¶2]  RRWC filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction, seeking to enjoin enforcement of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 which reads \nas follows: \n1.   As used in this section: \na.   “Abortion”  means  the  use  or  prescription  of  any \nsubstance, device, instrument, medicine, or drug to \nintentionally terminate the pregnancy of an individual \nknown to be pregnant. The term does not include an \nact made with the intent to increase the probability of \na live birth; preserve the life or health of a child after \n1 \n \n\n \n \nlive birth; or remove a dead, unborn child who died as \na result of a spontaneous miscarriage, an accidental \ntrauma,  or  a  criminal  assault  upon  the  pregnant \nfemale or her unborn child. \nb.   “Physician” means an individual licensed to practice \nmedicine under chapter 43-17. \nc.  “Professional judgment” means a medical judgment \nthat would be made by a reasonably prudent physician \nwho  is  knowledgeable  about  the  case  and  the \ntreatment  possibilities  with  respect  to  the  medical \nconditions involved. \n2.   It is a class C felony for a person, other than the pregnant \nfemale upon whom the abortion was performed, to perform \nan abortion. \n3.   The following are affirmative defenses under this section: \na.   That  the  abortion  was  necessary  in  professional \njudgment and was intended to prevent the death of the \npregnant female. \nb.  That the abortion was to terminate a pregnancy that \nresulted  from  gross  sexual  imposition,  sexual \nimposition, sexual abuse of a ward, or incest, as those \noffenses are defined in chapter 12.1-20. \nc.   That the individual was acting within the scope of that \nindividual’s  regulated  profession  and  under  the \ndirection of or at the direction of a physician. \n[¶3]  The district court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order \nand  preliminary  injunction.  The  State  requested  this  Court  exercise \nsupervisory jurisdiction to grant a writ, requiring the district court vacate the \npreliminary injunction asserting, in part, that the district court had failed to \ndetermine whether RRWC had a substantial likelihood of success on the merits \nof its claim, a prerequisite to granting a preliminary injunction. This Court \ngranted the State’s request in part, directing the district court to determine \nRRWC’s substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its cause of action \nand thereafter reconsider whether a preliminary injunction was appropriate. \n[¶4]  The district court conducted further analysis on whether RRWC had a \nsubstantial  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  and  held  RRWC  had  a \nsubstantial likelihood of prevailing in the litigation. The court concluded that \n2 \n \n\n \n \ncontinuation of the preliminary injunction was  necessary. This Court now \nconsiders the State’s request for a supervisory writ to vacate the preliminary \ninjunction. \nII  \n[¶5]  RRWC  argues  this  Court  should  decline  to  exercise  its  supervisory \njurisdiction because this issue is not the sort of “extraordinary case” where the \nCourt’s intervention is necessary. This Court’s authority to issue a supervisory \nwrit is “purely discretionary.” State, ex rel. Harris v. Lee, 2010 ND 88, ¶ 6, 782 \nN.W.2d 626 (quoting State v. Paulson, 2001 ND 82, ¶ 6, 625 N.W.2d 528). This \nCourt will “determine whether to exercise supervisory jurisdiction on a case-\nby-case basis, considering the unique circumstances of each case.” Id. “Exercise \nof supervisory jurisdiction may be warranted when issues of vital concern \nregarding matters of important public interest are presented.” Id. It is entirely \nwithin this Court’s discretion to address the issues raised or to decline to \naddress the issues. \n[¶6]  Section 12.1-31-12, N.D.C.C., was enacted in 2007. The enactment of the \nstatute  included  recognition  of  existing  United  States  Supreme  Court \nprecedents limiting the authority of states to regulate abortion. The effective \ndate of the statute was tied to the issuance of a judgment by the United States \nSupreme Court restoring to the states the authority to regulate abortion. \n[¶7]  On June 24, 2022, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision \nin Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization holding that the federal \nconstitution does not protect a woman’s right to abortion. 142 S.Ct. 2228 \n(2022). The Supreme Court explicitly overruled Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 \n(1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 \nU.S. 833 (1992), and expressly restored to the states the authority to regulate \nabortion. Dobbs, 142 S.Ct. at 2279. The Supreme Court reasoned “[i]t is time \nto heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected \nrepresentatives.” Id. at 2243. And, “[t]he permissibility of abortion, and the \nlimitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our \ndemocracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.” Id. \n3 \n \n\n \n \n(quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 979 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and \ndissenting in part)). \n[¶8]  This petition presents an unusual situation well within the range of our \npast decisions exercising original jurisdiction to “rectify errors and prevent \ninjustice in extraordinary cases[.]” Harris, 2010 ND 88, ¶ 6. An order granting \na preliminary injunction is by definition “extraordinary.” Black Gold OilField \nServs., LLC v. City of Williston, 2016 ND 30, ¶ 12, 875 N.W.2d 515; Vorachek \nv. Citizens State Bank, 461 N.W.2d 580, 585 (N.D. 1990). \n[¶9]  On another occasion, we exercised our original jurisdiction to consider \nan interim district court order restraining and enjoining during the pendency \nof the action the governor and other state officials from acting pursuant to \ncertain statutes relating to the Bank of North Dakota. State ex rel. Lemke v. \nDist.  Ct.  of  Stutsman  Cnty.,  186  N.W.  381  (1921).  The  Attorney  General \npetitioned this Court for relief in the form of an appropriate writ. Id. at 382. \nThe Court vacated the district court’s restraining order pending review of the \ntrial court action in issuing the restraining order. Id. at 383. We said: \nWe do not find it necessary to refer to the matters set forth in the \nreturn filed by the district judge, for in our view of the case it is \ncontrolled  by  certain  legal  principles  applicable  to  undisputed \nfacts, or facts of which we must take judicial notice. In other words, \nwe deem the questions arising in this case to be merely questions \nof law. \nId. We exercised our supervisory jurisdiction and issued “a writ directing the \ndistrict court, and the judge thereof, to set aside the restraining order issued \nat the commencement of the action.” Id. at 388. \n[¶10] In another case, this Court exercised its original jurisdiction to restrain \na district court from issuing a preliminary injunction. State ex rel. Dorgan v. \nFisk, 107 N.W. 191 (N.D. 1906). The board of drain commissioners of Grand \nForks County had advertised for bids for construction of a drain. Id. at 191. \nObjecting landowners filed suit and procured an order to show cause why a \npreliminary injunction should not be issued enjoining the defendant from \nfurther  proceedings  regarding  the  drain.  Id.  The  Board  appeared  at  the \n4 \n \n\n \n \nscheduled  hearing  and  objected,  after  which  “the  court  stated  that  a \npreliminary  injunction  would  be  issued.”  Id.  An  interested  landowner \npetitioned this Court for a writ “commanding [the district judge] to desist from \nfurther proceeding in the injunctional action.” Id. Exercising our discretionary \noriginal jurisdiction to grant the writ and restrain the district court from \nissuing an injunction, we explained: \nThe  remedy  by  appeal  would  exist  if  the  injunction  be \ngranted. The mere fact that an appeal would lie is not enough. It \nmust be speedy and adequate. The granting of the writ to inferior \ncourts is seldom a matter of absolute right as the remedy by appeal \ngenerally exists, and whether the appeal is speedy or adequate is \na matter within the discretion of the appellate court, depending \nupon the particular facts of each case. The court cannot accurately \ndetermine when a trial in the case at bar would come on nor when \nthe appeal would reach this court if an appeal were necessary. \nInasmuch as the district court has exceeded its jurisdiction, a trial \nis unnecessary, and would be expensive and vexatious to each \nparty; and that the result of a trial and appeal could not under the \nmost favorable circumstances, be as speedy as a decision upon this \noriginal proceeding, we deem it a proper case for issuing a writ. \nThe  application  for  the  writ  is  made  to  hasten  a  public \nimprovement deemed to be of importance, at least to the petitioner \nand a large number of interested persons. There being a plain case \nof want of jurisdiction presented, and the appeal not being as \nspeedy or adequate as this proceeding, we are satisfied that the \npetitioner is entitled to this summary and extraordinary remedy. \nWe appreciate that this remedy should be cautiously granted. But, \nin view of the nature of the act that was enjoined, we have no doubt \nof the propriety and legality of assuming original jurisdiction. \nId. at 194. \n[¶11] The issue presented by this petition is an issue of vital concern regarding \na matter of important public interest. The extent to which a state legislature \nmay  regulate  abortions  has  been  the  subject  of  multiple  United  States \nSupreme Court decisions, decisions of this Court, and the underlying action \ncontends the legislature has exceeded its constitutional authority in regulating \n5 \n \n\n \n \nabortion. We choose to exercise our discretion to review whether the district \ncourt abused its discretion issuing a preliminary injunction. \nIII \n[¶12] The State challenges each of the required elements for the granting of a \npreliminary injunction. We have noted the following regarding the elements \nnecessary for a preliminary injunction: \nA  trial  court’s  discretion  to  grant  or  deny  a  preliminary \ninjunction  is  based  on  the  following  factors:  (1)  substantial \nprobability of succeeding on the merits; (2) irreparable injury; (3) \nharm  to  other  interested  parties;  and  (4)  effect  on  the  public \ninterest. Nodak Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ward County Farm Bureau, 2004 \nND 60, ¶ 24, 676 N.W.2d 752; Vorachek v. Citizens State Bank, 461 \nN.W.2d 580, 585 (N.D. 1990). The decision to grant or deny a \npreliminary injunction is within the discretion of a trial court, and \nits determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse \nof discretion. Nodak Mut., 2004 ND 60, ¶ 24, 676 N.W.2d 752. A \ntrial  court  abuses  its  discretion  if  it  acts  in  an  arbitrary, \nunreasonable, or unconscionable manner, its decision is not the \nproduct  of  a  rational  mental  process  leading  to  a  reasoned \ndetermination, or it misinterprets or misapplies the law. Id. \nEberts v. Billings Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 2005 ND 85, ¶ 8, 695 N.W.2d 691. \n“Generally, ‘a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy \nand should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the \nburden  of  persuasion.’”  Black  Gold  OilField,  2016  ND  30,  ¶  12  (quoting \nVorachek, at 585). \nIV \n[¶13] RRWC argues it has a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits \nin the underlying lawsuit because there is a fundamental right to receive \nabortion care under the North Dakota Constitution. RRWC’s complaint asserts \nthe statute is unconstitutional and provides that RRWC is challenging the \nentirety  of  the  statute,  but  also  asserts  challenges  on  behalf  of  various \nconstituencies, including women seeking abortions and practicing physicians. \n6 \n \n\n \n \n[¶14] An initial determination of whether there is a fundamental right to an \nabortion under the State Constitution is necessary because, if such a right \nexists within our Constitution, the statute is subject to strict scrutiny by this \nCourt. Hoff v. Berg, 1999 ND 115, ¶ 13, 595 N.W.2d 285. In contrast, if we \nconclude there is no fundamental right to abortion, the statute is subject to a \nreview by this Court as to whether the legislature had a rational basis for \nenactment. Id. \n[¶15] RRWC  argues  sections  1  and  12  of  article  I  of  the  North  Dakota \nConstitution provide for a fundamental right to abortion. These sections read \nas follows: \nSection 1. All individuals are by nature equally free and \nindependent and have certain inalienable rights, among which are \nthose  of  enjoying  and  defending  life  and  liberty;  acquiring, \npossessing and protecting property and reputation; pursuing and \nobtaining safety and happiness; and to keep and bear arms for the \ndefense of their person, family, property, and the state, and for \nlawful hunting, recreational, and other lawful purposes, which \nshall not be infringed. \n. . . .  \nSection 12. In criminal prosecutions in any court whatever, \nthe party accused shall have the right to a speedy and public trial; \nto  have  the  process  of  the  court  to  compel  the  attendance  of \nwitnesses in his behalf; and to appear and defend in person and \nwith counsel. No person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same \noffense, nor be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness \nagainst himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property without \ndue process of law. \nN.D. Const. art. I, §§ 1 and 12. \n[¶16] RRWC  argues  the  North  Dakota  Constitution  should  be  interpreted \nexpansively because the North Dakota Constitution “is a living, breathing, \nvital instrument, adaptable to the needs of the day, and was so intended by the \npeople when adopted.” State v. Norton, 255 N.W. 787, 792 (N.D. 1934). The \nState argues there is no constitutional right to an abortion under either section \n7 \n \n\n \n \nof article I of the North Dakota Constitution, citing to MKB Management Corp. \nv.  Burdick,  2014  ND  197,  855  N.W.2d  31  (VandeWalle,  Chief  Justice, \nconcurring). The State contends the inherent rights recognized under sections \n1 and 12, such as the fundamental right of parents to parent their child are \ndistinguishable from abortion because abortion, unlike the right to parent one’s \nown child, does not have longstanding roots in American culture. \n[¶17] This  Court  uses  the  following  framework  when  interpreting \nconstitutional provisions: \nIn interpreting constitutional provisions, we apply general \nprinciples of statutory construction. Thompson v. Jaeger, 2010 ND \n174, ¶ 7, 788 N.W.2d 586. Our overriding objective is to give effect \nto the intent and purpose of the people adopting the constitutional \nprovision. City of Bismarck v. Fettig, 1999 ND 193, ¶ 8, 601 N.W.2d \n247. The intent and purpose of constitutional provisions are to be \ndetermined, if possible, from the language itself. Thompson, at ¶ \n7. In construing constitutional provisions, we ascribe to the words \nthe meaning the framers understood the provisions to have when \nadopted. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Schs., 402 N.W.2d 897, 899 \n(N.D. 1987). We may consider contemporary legal practices and \nlaws  in  effect  when  the  people  adopted  the  constitutional \nprovisions. See State v. Orr, 375 N.W.2d 171, 177-78 (N.D. 1985) \n(interpreting right to counsel provision of state constitution in view \nof statutes in effect when constitution adopted); City of Bismarck \nv. Altevogt, 353 N.W.2d 760, 764-65 (N.D. 1984) (interpreting right \nto jury trial under state constitution in view of territorial statutes \ndefining right to jury trial). \nMKB Mgmt. Corp., 2014 ND 197, ¶ 25. “[T]he North Dakota Constitution must \nbe read in the light of history.” State v. Allesi, 216 N.W.2d 805, 817 (N.D. 1974). \n[¶18] Whether there  is a fundamental right to abortion within  the  North \nDakota Constitution was before this Court previously in MKB Management \nCorp. In MKB Management Corp., this Court could not reach a sufficient \nmajority to hold the underlying statute unconstitutional, the result RRWC is \nultimately seeking in this case. MKB Mgmt. Corp., 2014 ND 197, ¶ 1. See N.D. \nConst. art. VI, § 4 (“[This Court] shall not declare a legislative enactment \n8 \n \n\n \n \nunconstitutional unless at least four of the members of the court so decide.”). \nAdditionally,  this  Court  was  unable  to  determine  whether  there  is  a \nfundamental right to an abortion under the North Dakota Constitution. MKB \nMgmt. Corp., at ¶ 1 (VandeWalle, C.J., concurred, at ¶ 38 finding “our state \nconstitutional provisions were not intended to encompass a fundamental right \nto  abortion[.]”);  (Kapsner,  J.,  and  Maring,  J.,  writing  separately,  at  ¶  97 \nconcluding  “a  fundamental  right  to  choose  abortion  before  viability  exists \nunder a woman’s liberty interest in article [I], section 1 of the North Dakota \nconstitution  and  that  interest  is  protected  under  article  [I],  section  12.”); \n(Crothers, J., concurred, at ¶ 157 finding this case should not be decided under \nthe North Dakota Constitution); (Sandstrom, J., concurred, at ¶ 170 stating \n“[t]he  Chief  Justice  persuasively  argues  there  is  no  separate  state \nconstitutional right to an abortion.”). \n[¶19] Several  states  have  found  their  state  constitutions  provide  for  a \nfundamental right to abortion. The Minnesota Supreme Court recognized a \nfundamental right to abortion under a combination of sections and rights in \nthe Minnesota Constitution. Women of State of Minn. by Doe v. Gomez, 542 \nN.W.2d  17,  19  (Minn.  1995).  The  California  Supreme  Court  found  a \nfundamental right to abortion under California’s constitutional privacy clause. \nAm. Acad. of Pediatrics v. Lungren, 16 Cal.4th 307, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 \nP.2d 797, 819 (1997). The Alaska Supreme Court found a fundamental right to \nabortion within the right to privacy in the Alaska Constitution. Valley Hosp. \nAss’n, Inc. v. Mat-Su Coal. for Choice, 948 P.2d 963, 969 (Alaska 1997). The \nMontana Supreme Court found a fundamental right to an  abortion under \nMontana’s constitutional provision which explicitly guarantees its citizens the \nright of privacy. Armstrong v. State, 296 Mont. 361, 989 P.2d 364, 387 (1999). \nThe New Jersey Supreme Court found a fundamental right to abortion within \nthe “natural and unalienable rights” clause of the New Jersey Constitution. \nPlanned Parenthood of Cent. N.J. v. Farmer, 165 N.J. 609, 762 A.2d 620, 629 \n(2000).  The  Kansas  Supreme  Court  has  concluded  its  state  constitution \nprovides abortion rights. Hodes & Nauser, MDs, P.A. v. Schmidt, 309 Kan. 610, \n440 P.3d 461 (2019). Lastly, the Florida Supreme Court found a fundamental \n9 \n \n\n \n \nright to abortion within Florida’s constitutional right to privacy. Gainesville \nWoman Care, LLC v. State, 210 So.3d 1243, 1252 (Fla. 2017). \n[¶20] For the reasons set out below, we conclude RRWC has a substantial \nlikelihood in establishing there is a fundamental right for a woman to obtain \nan abortion in instances where it is necessary to preserve her life or health. We \nneed go no further here to determine whether there are fundamental rights \nbroader in scope. \n[¶21] “Our overriding objective is to give effect to the intent and purpose of the \npeople adopting the constitutional statement.” State v. Hagerty, 1998 ND 122, \n¶ 13, 580 N.W.2d 139 (quoting Comm’n on Med. Competency v. Racek, 527 \nN.W.2d  262,  266  (N.D.  1995)).  To  accomplish  this  we  must  construe  the \nconstitution in light of the contemporaneous history existing at and prior to \nthe adoption of the constitutional provision. City of West Fargo v. McAllister, \n2022 ND 94, ¶ 6, 974 N.W.2d 393. \n[¶22] North Dakota Constitution article I, section 1 was enacted in 1889 when \nNorth Dakota was admitted as a state to the Union. Section 1 provides, in part, \n“[a]ll individuals are by nature equally free and independent and have certain \ninalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and \nliberty;  acquiring,  possessing  and  protecting  property  and  reputation; \npursuing and obtaining safety and happiness[.]” N.D. Const. art. I, § 1. The \nNorth Dakota Constitution explicitly provides all citizens of North Dakota the \nright of enjoying and defending life and pursuing and obtaining safety. These \nrights  implicitly  include  the  right  to  obtain  an  abortion  to  preserve  the \nwoman’s life or health. \n[¶23] North Dakota’s history and traditions support this conclusion. North \nDakota has a long history of permitting women to obtain abortions to preserve \ntheir life or health. Prior to statehood, North Dakota, then part of the Dakota \nTerritory, criminalized abortions but explicitly provided an abortion was not a \ncriminal act if the treatment was done to preserve the life of the woman: \nEvery person who administers to any pregnant woman, or who \nprescribes for any such woman, or advises or procures any such \n10 \n \n\n \n \nwoman to take any medicine, drug or substance, or uses or employs \nany instrument, or other means whatever, with intent thereby to \nprocure  the  miscarriage  of  such  woman,  unless  the  same  is \nnecessary to preserve her life, is punishable by imprisonment in \nthe territorial prison not exceeding three years, or in a county jail \nnot exceeding one year. \nCompiled Laws of the Territory of Dakota, Penal Code, § 6538 (1887). The laws \nof the Dakota Territory read identically and provided the ability to receive a \nlife-preserving abortion in 1877 and 1883. \n[¶24] After  statehood,  North  Dakota  enacted  a  law  which  criminalized \nabortions but again explicitly provided an abortion would not be considered a \ncriminal act if the treatment was done to preserve the life of the woman, which \nread: \nEvery person who administers to any pregnant woman, or who \nprescribes for any such woman, or advises or procures any such \nwoman to take any medicine, drug or substance, or uses or employs \nany instrument or other means whatever, with intent thereby to \nprocure  the  miscarriage  of  such  woman,  unless  the  same  is \nnecessary to preserve her life, is punishable by imprisonment in \nthe penitentiary not less than one and not exceeding three years, \nor in a county jail not exceeding one year. \nN.D. Rev. Code § 7177 (1895). North Dakota’s legislature repeatedly reaffirmed \nthe criminal prohibitions in substantially the same form and always with the \nsame exception for abortions “necessary to preserve her life.” N.D. Rev. Code § \n7177 (1899); N.D. Rev. Code § 8912 (1905); N.D. Rev. Code § 9604 (1913); N.D. \nRev. Code § 12-2501 (1943); N.D.C.C. § 12-25-01 (1959); N.D.C.C. § 12.1-19-01 \n(1973).  North  Dakota  did  not  criminalize  life-preserving  abortions  until \nN.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 was enacted in 2007 and became eligible for enforcement \nin 2022. \n[¶25] Medical  journals  published  shortly  after  statehood  indicate  it  was \ncommon knowledge that an abortion could be performed to preserve the life or \nhealth of the woman. \n11 \n \n\n \n \nThere  are  not  infrequently  cases  in  which  an  abortion  is \nimperative: the mentally unfit who might become deranged; the \nwoman with a narrow brim or outlet because of which her life \nmight be in danger and a Cesar[e]an section is the only relief; the \nwoman who may bleed to death; the eclamptic; and those suffering \nfrom  dangerous  diseases.  This  class,  fortunately,  is  small  in \nnumber; and abortion is performed only after a deliberate and \ncareful  consultation  in  which  the  dangers  of  the  abortion  are \nweighed from every side. \nCriminal Abortions, 34 JOURNAL-LANCET 81, 82 (1914). Additionally, in the \njournal a doctor describes an abortion performed: “Mrs. T. first came under the \nwriter’s care for acute septic abortion. The uterus were emptied, and after a \nrather  continued  run  of  temperature  the  patient  made  a  symptomatic \nrecovery.”  A.C.  Stokes,  M.D.,  Diseases  of  the  Urinary  Tract  Produced  by \nDiseases of the Genital Tract in the Female, 34 JOURNAL-LANCET 593, 594 \n(1914).  North  Dakota  recognized  and  approved  abortions  performed  to \npreserve the life or health of the woman. \n[¶26] The State asserts abortion cannot be included as a fundamental right, \nbecause the inherent rights reserved to the people under sections 1 and 12, \nsuch  as  the  fundamental  right  of  parents  to  parent  their  child,  are \ndistinguishable from abortion because abortion, unlike the right to parent one’s \nown  child,  does  not  have  longstanding  roots  in  American  culture. This \nassertion is incorrect, as noted above, North Dakota has a longstanding history \nof allowing pregnant women to receive an abortion to preserve her life or \nhealth. The legislature enacted and reaffirmed laws which always provided an \nexception to preserve the life of the woman up and until 2007 when N.D.C.C. \n§ 12.1-31-12 was enacted as a trigger law. See N.D. Rev. Code § 7177 (1899); \nN.D. Rev. Code § 8912 (1905); N.D. Rev. Code § 9604 (1913); N.D. Rev. Code § \n12-2501  (1943);  N.D.C.C.  §  12-25-01  (1959);  N.D.C.C.  §  12.1-19-01  (1973); \nN.D.C.C. § 14-02.1-04 (1975). Like the right to parent one’s own child, the right \nto  receive  a  health  or  life-preserving  abortion  is  deeply  rooted  in  North \nDakota’s history and culture. \n12 \n \n\n \n \n[¶27] Fundamental rights are those which are deeply rooted in history and \ntradition and are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. State v. Baxter, 2015 \nND 107, ¶ 15, 863 N.W.2d 208. North Dakota’s history and traditions, as well \nas the plain language of its Constitution, establish that the right of a woman \nto receive an abortion to preserve her life or health was implicit in North \nDakota’s concept of ordered liberty before, during, and at the time of statehood. \nAfter review of North Dakota’s history and traditions, and the plain language \nof article I, section 1 of the North Dakota Constitution, it is clear the citizens \nof North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and \nobtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental \nright to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health. \nV \n[¶28] Because we hold the North Dakota Constitution provides a fundamental \nright to receive an abortion to preserve a pregnant woman’s life or health, the \nconstitutionality of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 must be analyzed under the strict \nscrutiny standard. A statute which restricts a fundamental right is subject to \nstrict scrutiny standard of review which will only be justified if it furthers a \ncompelling government interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. \nHoff, 1999 ND 115, ¶ 14. \n[¶29] The State argues it has a compelling interest in protecting women’s \nhealth  and  protecting  unborn  human  life.  RRWC  does  not  challenge  this \nassertion. We have previously held several interests compelling, including the \nState’s interest in establishing minimum standards of education for children, \ninterest in promoting grandparent visitation while protecting parents’ right to \nparent their child, interest in highway safety, and an interest in regulating the \npractice of law within its boundaries. Bismarck Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. State \nBy and Through N.D. Legislative Assembly, 511 N.W.2d 247, 259 (N.D. 1994); \nKulbacki v. Michael, 2014 ND 83, ¶ 9, 845 N.W.2d 625; Kobilanksy v. Liffrig, \n358 N.W.2d 781, 791 (N.D. 1984); State v. Niska, 380 N.W.2d 646, 650 (N.D. \n1986). The State has a compelling interest in protecting women’s health and \nprotecting unborn human life, as these interests are at least of the same \nimportance as compelling interests previously identified by this Court. \n13 \n \n\n \n \n[¶30] Nevertheless,  the  State  must  still  show  N.D.C.C.  §  12.1-31-12  is \nnecessary  to  achieve  the  compelling  state  interests.  While  we  note  the \nlegislature can regulate abortion, it must do so in a manner that is narrowly \ntailored to achieve the compelling interest. Hoff, 1999 ND 115, ¶ 13. On its \nface, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 unnecessarily restricts a woman’s access to an \nabortion  to  preserve  her  life  or  health.  Section  12.1-31-12,  N.D.C.C., \ncriminalizes abortions performed even if the abortion is to preserve the life or \nhealth of the woman. The statute requires a physician who performs a life-\npreserving abortion to face prosecution of a class C felony, and if prosecuted \nprove by a preponderance of the evidence the abortion was necessary to save \nthe life of the woman. This is not narrowly tailored to achieve the State’s \ninterests in women’s health and protecting unborn human life. \n[¶31] Moreover, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 provides an affirmative defense only if \nin the professional judgment of the physician the abortion was necessary to \nprevent the death of the female. A pregnant woman is unable to obtain an \nabortion in order to preserve her health, regardless of the potential health \nconsequences. Preserving the life or health of the woman necessarily includes \nproviding an abortion when necessary to prevent severe, life altering damage. \nThe United States District of Idaho explained the grave risks to health a \npregnant woman faces: \nPregnant women in Idaho routinely arrive at emergency rooms \nexperiencing severe complications. The patient might be spiking a \nfever,  experiencing  uterine  cramping  and  chills,  contractions, \nshortness  of  breath,  or  significant  vaginal  bleeding.  The  ER \nphysician  may  diagnose  her  with,  among  other  possibilities, \ntraumatic  placental  abruption,  preeclampsia,  or  a  preterm \npremature rupture of the membranes. In those situations, the \nphysician may be called upon to make complex, difficult decisions \nin a fast-moving, chaotic environment. She may conclude that the \nonly way to prevent serious harm to the patient or save her life is \nto terminate the pregnancy—a devastating result for the doctor \nand the patient. \n. . . .  \n14 \n \n\n \n \nYet if the physician does not perform the abortion, the pregnant \npatient  faces  grave  risks  to  her  health—such  as  severe  sepsis \nrequiring  limb  amputation,  uncontrollable  uterine  hemorrhage \nrequiring hysterectomy, kidney failure requiring lifelong dialysis, \nhypoxic brain injury, or even death. And this woman, if she lives, \npotentially  may  have  to  live  the  remainder  of  her  life  with \nsignificant disabilities and chronic medical conditions as a result \nof her pregnancy complication. All because Idaho law prohibited \nthe physician from performing the abortion. \n \nGranted, the Idaho statute offers the physician the cold comfort of \na narrow affirmative defense to avoid conviction. But only if she \nconvinces  a  jury  that,  in  her  good  faith  medical  judgment, \nperforming the abortion was “necessary to prevent the death of the \npregnant woman” can she possibly avoid conviction. Even then, \nthere is no certainty a jury will acquit. And the physician cannot \nenjoy the benefit of this affirmative defense if she performed the \nabortion merely to prevent serious harm to the patient, rather \nthan to save her life. \nUnited States v. Idaho, 2022 WL 3692618, 1 (D. Idaho 2022). (Federal district \ncourt analyzing the Idaho statute under the Emergency Medical Treatment & \nLabor Act preemption.) A law that on its face criminalizes a life-preserving \nabortion, infringes unnecessarily on a woman’s fundamental right to seek an \nabortion to preserve her life or health, at least in part, cannot withstand strict \nscrutiny. \n[¶32] The State asserts N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 is narrowly tailored because it \nprovides a “narrow” definition of abortion. Section 12.1-31-12 defines abortion \nas follows: \n“Abortion” means the use or prescription of any substance, device, \ninstrument,  medicine,  or  drug  to  intentionally  terminate  the \npregnancy of an individual known to be pregnant. The term does \nnot include an act made with the intent to increase the probability \nof a live birth; preserve the life or health of a child after live birth; \nor  remove  a  dead,  unborn  child  who  died  as  a  result  of  a \nspontaneous  miscarriage,  an  accidental  trauma,  or  a  criminal \nassault upon the pregnant female or her unborn child. \n15 \n \n\n \n \nN.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12(1)(a). This definition is not narrowly tailored to women’s \nhealth.  Notably,  the  definition  does  not  include  abortions  for  ectopic \npregnancies, which is a pregnancy where the fertilized egg “does not implant \nappropriately within the uterus” and is potentially lethal to the mother. 2 Am. \nLaw Med. Malp. § 13:6 (2022). Therefore, under the statutory construction of \nN.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12, an abortion to treat an ectopic pregnancy would be a \ncriminal act. As noted above, criminalizing life-preserving abortions is not \nnecessary to promote the State’s interests in women’s health and protecting \nunborn human life. \n[¶33] In  sum,  the  history  and  traditions  of  North  Dakota  support  the \nconclusion that there is a fundamental right to receive an abortion to preserve \nthe life or the health of the mother. Thus, in order to withstand constitutional \nscrutiny, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 must be necessary to promote a compelling \ninterest. As described above, the statute is not narrowly tailored to promote \nwomen’s health and protect unborn human life. Therefore, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-\n12 is unconstitutional, and RRWC has a substantial likelihood of succeeding \non the merits at least with respect to life or health preserving abortions. \nVI \n[¶34] The second factor relevant to granting a preliminary injunction is the \nirreparable injury a party will suffer in the absence of a preliminary injunction. \nAn  injury  is  irreparable  when  it  cannot  be  adequately \ncompensated  in  damages,  and  it  is  not  necessary  that  the \npecuniary damage be shown to be great. * * * Acts which result in \na serious change of, or are destructive to, the property affected \neither physically or in the character in which it has been held or \nenjoyed, * * * do an irreparable injury * * *. 43 C.J.S., Injunctions, \n§ 23, pp. 446, 447, 448. \nVorachek, 461 N.W.2d at 585 (quotations omitted) (quoting Viestenz v. Arthur \nTwp., 78 N.D. 1029, 54 N.W.2d 572, 578 (1952)). \n[¶35] RRWC argued if N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 is allowed to be enforced during \nthe pendency of this litigation, irreparable damage will likely result from the \n16 \n \n\n \n \npotentially life-saving or injury avoiding abortions that will not be performed \nat other healthcare facilities on an emergency basis. The irreparable injury to \nthe state is the irreversible loss of unborn human life. The death of unborn \nchildren and the potential death or injury of a pregnant woman are both tragic. \nWhile we may have found this factor neutral, under an abuse of discretion \nstandard we “will not reverse a district court’s decision merely because it is not \nthe one [we] would have made had it been [this Court] deciding the motion.” \nAnderson v. Baker, 2015 ND 269, ¶ 7, 871 N.W.2d 830. The district court did \nnot  abuse  its  discretion  in  determining  RRWC  would  suffer  a  greater \nirreparable injury than the State. \nVII \n[¶36] The third factor relevant to granting a preliminary injunction is the \nharm to other interested parties. RRWC argued if N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 is not \nenjoined, the women of North Dakota will face grave harm. The State argued \nthe citizens of North Dakota will face grave harm if N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 is \nenjoined, because the citizens of North Dakota have an interest in legislation \nbeing enforced. The district court found RRWC’s arguments more persuasive, \nfinding N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 has been lying dormant for almost 15 years and \nthe State failed to show how an additional delay would greatly harm any other \ninterested parties. The district court did not abuse its discretion determining \nthis factor weighed in RRWC’s favor because the district court did not act in an \narbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable manner in determining the lack of \nan injunction would cause harm to other interested parties. \nVIII \n[¶37] The final factor relevant to granting a preliminary injunction is the effect \non public interest. RRWC argued it is always in the public interest to protect \nconstitutional rights and abortion has been legal in North Dakota for 50 years. \nThe State argued that prior to Roe and Casey,  North  Dakota had a long \nstanding  history  of  prohibiting  abortions.  The  district  court  noted  both \narguments were valid; however, the purpose of preliminary injunctions is to \nmaintain the status quo during the pendency of litigation and at this time the \n17 \n \n\n \n \nstatus quo in North Dakota is not to restrict or limit abortions in the manner \nprovided for in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12. \n[¶38] “[T]he purpose of a temporary or preliminary injunction ‘is to maintain \nthe cause in status quo until a trial on the merits.’” State v. Holecek, 545 \nN.W.2d 800, 804 (N.D. 1996) (quoting Gunsch v. Gunsch, 69 N.W.2d 739, 745 \n(N.D. 1954)). Roe v. Wade, which found a constitutional right to an abortion \nwithin the  United States Constitution  was decided in 1973.  410 U.S. 113 \n(1973). From 1973 until June 2022 the right to obtain an abortion, with some \nrestrictions, has been present nationwide and in North  Dakota. After the \nDobbs decision overturned Roe, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 was not triggered before \nthe district court ordered the injunction. Therefore, the status quo in North \nDakota for 49 years has been to allow for abortion care. The district court \nproperly determined the status quo at this time is to generally allow abortion \ncare and thus to maintain that status quo until a trial on the merits is held, \nN.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 should be temporarily enjoined from enforcement. The \ndistrict court did not act in an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable \nmanner in determining the effect of the public interest weighs in favor of \ngranting a preliminary injunction. \nIX \n[¶39] The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining RRWC has \na  substantial  likelihood  of  succeeding  on  the  merits,  RRWC  will  suffer \nirreparable injury, failure to enjoin N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 will cause harm to \nother interested parties, and it is in the public interest to enjoin enforcement \nof N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12. The district court did not abuse its discretion in \ngranting the preliminary injunction. \nX \n[¶40] The North Dakota Constitution guarantees North Dakota citizens the \nright to enjoy and defend life and the right to pursue and obtain safety, which \nnecessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an \nabortion  to  preserve  her  life  or  her  health.  Thus,  strict  scrutiny  analysis \napplies, and RRWC has a substantial likelihood of demonstrating N.D.C.C. § \n18 \n \n\n \n \n12.1-31-12  is  not  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  a  compelling  government \ninterest, at least in the limited instances of life-saving and health-preserving \ncircumstances. The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the \npreliminary injunction. We deny the requested relief and leave the preliminary \ninjunction in place. \n[¶41] Jon J. Jensen, C.J.  \nDaniel J. Crothers  \nLisa Fair McEvers \nDaniel D. Narum, D.J. \nTufte, Justice, concurring. \n[¶42] I agree with the majority opinion, with the understanding that to reach \nthe result here, “life or health” need not be understood more broadly than its \napplication to the right of self-defense. Section 12.1-31-12, N.D.C.C., provides \nonly an affirmative defense and not an exception for abortion intended to save \na pregnant woman’s life. For that reason, there is a substantial probability it \nis unconstitutional in violation of the right of self-defense protected by N.D. \nConst. art. I, § 1. At this time we consider only the preliminary injunction, and \nwe  need  not  decide  the  constitutionally  necessary  scope  of  any  health \nexception. \n[¶43] The North Dakota Constitution guarantees the “inalienable right[ ] ... of \nenjoying and defending life and liberty.” N.D. Const. art. I, § 1. Commonly, an \nindividual exercises this right of self-defense by responding to a threat of \nimminent serious bodily injury or death with physical force. City of Jamestown \nv. Kastet, 2022 ND 40, ¶ 17, 970 N.W.2d 187; State v. Olander, 1998 ND 50, \n¶ 20, 575 N.W.2d 658. Where a pregnancy raises a similar threat of serious \nbodily  injury  or  death,  the  pregnant  woman  has  a  fundamental  right  to \npreserve her life and health with the aid of a physician. Our recognition of this \nfundamental right to preserve one’s life does not depend on resolving  the \ndisputed  point  of  pregnancy  at  which  there  are  two  lives  that  must  be \nconsidered. The State has a compelling interest in protecting unborn human \nlife, which RRWC does not dispute. Majority, at ¶ 29. We have long understood \n19 \n \n\n \n \nthat a woman has an inalienable right to employ deadly force against another \nperson when necessary to protect herself against death or serious bodily injury. \nState v. Leidholm, 334 N.W.2d 811, 820 (N.D. 1983); United States v. Leighton, \n3 Dakota 29, 13 N.W. 347, 348 (1882). Likewise, the State’s compelling interest \non behalf of an unborn child must yield to the pregnant woman’s right to abort \na pregnancy when necessary to preserve her life or health. \n[¶44] If there is merely evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about a \nself-defense claim, a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense \nand the State must prove the absence of self-defense as an element of the \noffense beyond a reasonable doubt. Kastet, 2022 ND 40, ¶ 17; Olander, 1998 \nND 50, ¶ 20; State v. Hazlett, 113 N.W. 374, 378 (N.D. 1907). Where an abortion \nis performed in situations that fall within the constitutional right of self-\ndefense,  section  12.1-31-12,  N.D.C.C.,  unconstitutionally  places  the \nevidentiary burden on the defendant to raise not merely a reasonable doubt, \nbut to prove an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. To that \nextent,  RRWC  has  demonstrated  a  substantial  probability  of  success  in \ndemonstrating N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 is unconstitutional in violation of N.D. \nConst. art. I, § 1. \n[¶45] We do not decide here what scope of health risks may give rise to abortion \nas medical self-defense. In the district court, the parties will have opportunity \nto present historical evidence illuminating the meaning of Article I, § 1, and to \nfurther develop their legal arguments. Before Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), \nrestrictive  abortion  laws  in  North  Dakota  and  nationwide  uniformly \nrecognized  exceptions  for  abortion  intended  to  save  the  woman’s  life.  See \nEugene Volokh, Medical Self-Defense, Prohibited Experimental Therapies, and \nPayment for Organs, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 1813, 1825 (2007) (“[T]he abortion-as-\nself-defense  right  is  largely  uncontroversial,  at  least  when  threats  to  the \nmother’s life, and not just to her psychological health, are involved: it was \naccepted even in Chief Justice Rehnquist’s Roe dissent, [and] it was recognized \nby all the restrictive abortion laws in effect when Roe was decided.”). \n[¶46] There may or may not be sufficient historical evidence to support a \nbroader  self-defense  or  other  fundamental  right  implicated  by  the  state’s \n20 \n \n\n \n \nabortion regulations. That question is not resolved here. Today our decision is \none  of  likely  success  on  the  merits  necessary  to  support  a  preliminary \ninjunction.  Before  final  resolution  of  the  claims,  the  parties  may  present \nhistorical evidence on the state constitution’s original meaning, both when \nadopted in 1889 and when amended in 1984. The court also may receive further \nlegal argument about the meaning of Article I, § 1, and any rights guaranteed \nby “necessary implication.” Black’s Law Dictionary 903 (11th ed. 2019); see also \nHenry Campbell Black, A Dictionary of Law 806 (1st ed. 1891) (“so strong a \nprobability of intention that an intention contrary . . . cannot be supposed”). I \nagree with Justice McEvers that Cooley’s treatise may well provide insight into \nwhat the people who drafted and adopted our declaration of fundamental \nrights meant by the words chosen and how they expected those words to be \ninterpreted by the courts. Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \nLimitations  Which  Rest  Upon  the  Legislative  Power  of  the  States  of  the \nAmerican Union 45-47, ch. IV & VII (5th ed. 1883). If the district court enters \na permanent injunction, it may have to address questions of severability and \nconsider any amendments to the statute enacted while this matter is pending. \nAlso unresolved here is how the district court and this Court ultimately assess \nthe narrow tailoring requirement where there are two compelling interests and \nit appears that the more narrowly tailored a statute is to protecting the life \nand health of pregnant women, the less narrowly tailored it is to the State’s \ninterest in protecting unborn life, and vice versa. \n[¶47] Jerod E. Tufte \nMcEvers, Justice, concurring specially. \n[¶48] I agree with the majority to exercise our discretion to review and deny \nthe  requested  relief  as  set  forth  in  the  majority  opinion,  upholding  the \ninjunction on narrow grounds. I write separately to explain how and why the \nrights protected under the North Dakota Constitution may be broader than \nthose protected under the United States Constitution. \n[¶49] The historical perspective leading to adopting our state constitution is \nhelpful  to  understand  the  difference  between  the  state  and  federal \n21 \n \n\n \n \nconstitutions. The prominent late nineteenth century American legal scholar \nThomas Cooley cautioned against mistaking a state constitution’s recognition \nof a right as being the source of its creation: \nIn considering State constitutions we must not commit the \nmistake of supposing that, because individual rights are guarded \nand protected by them, they must also be considered as owing their \norigin  to  them.  These  instruments  measure  the  powers  of  the \nrulers, but they do not measure the rights of the governed.  \nThomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest \nupon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union, *36 (2d ed. \n1871).  Professor  Cooley  explained  a  constitution  “grants  no  rights  to  the \npeople,” but instead is “[d]esigned for their protection in the enjoyment of the \nrights and powers which they possessed before the constitution was made.” Id. \n[¶50] Professor Cooley also described the difference between the Constitution \nof the United States and a state constitution: \nIt is to be borne in mind, however, that there is a broad \ndifference between the Constitution of the United States and the \nconstitutions  of  States  as  regards  the  powers  which  may  be \nexercised under them. The government of the United States is one \nof enumerated powers; the governments of the States are possessed \nof all general powers of legislation. When a law of Congress is \nassailed as void, we look in the national Constitution to see if the \ngrant of specified powers is broad enough to embrace it; but when \na State law is attacked on the same ground, it is presumably valid \nin any case, and this presumption is a conclusive one, unless in the \nConstitution of the United States or of the State we are able to \ndiscover that it is prohibited. We look in the Constitution of the \nUnited  States  for  grants  of  legislative  power,  but  in  the \nconstitution of the State to ascertain if any limitations have been \nimposed  upon  the  complete  power  with  which  the  legislative \ndepartment  of  the  State  was  vested  in  its  creation.  .  .  .  That \ninstrument has been aptly termed a legislative act by the people \nthemselves  in  their  sovereign  capacity,  and  is  therefore  the \nparamount law. Its object is not to grant legislative power, but to \nconfine  and  restrain  it.  Without  constitutional  limitations,  the \n22 \n \n\n \n \npower  to  make  law  would  be  absolute.  These  limitations  are \ncreated  and  imposed  by  express  words,  or  arise  by  necessary \nimplication. . . . The executive can do no legislative act, nor the \nlegislature any executive act, and neither can exercise judicial \nauthority. \nIt does not follow, however, that in every case the courts, \nbefore they set aside a law as invalid, must be able to find in the \nconstitution some specific inhibition which has been disregarded, \nor some express command which has been disobeyed. \nCooley, supra, at *173-74 (italics in original; underlining added). \n[¶51] Professor Cooley described certain rights as “fundamental,” specifically \nnoting “that all men are by nature free and independent, and have certain \ninalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and \nliberty,  acquiring,  possessing,  and  protecting  property,  and  pursuing  and \nobtaining  safety  and  happiness.”  Cooley,  supra,  at  *35.  Likely,  it  is  no \ncoincidence  that  N.D.  Const.  art.  I,  §  1  identifies  all  of  the  natural  and \ninalienable rights identified by Professor Cooley with the same language he \nused  (except  one  word  I  discuss  below).  Professor  Cooley  addressed  our \nconstitutional drafters on July 17, 1889, in Bismarck. See Official Report of the \nProceedings  and  Debates  of  the  First  Constitutional  Convention  of  North \nDakota, 65-67 (1889).  He told them they were setting out “guiding landmarks” \nthat will exist “probably for all time.” Id. at 65. He cautioned them “that times \nchange,” and he advised them not to “legislate too much.” Id. at 66-67. He said \n“[t]ake care to put proper restrictions” on the legislature, “but at the same time \nleave what properly belongs to the field of legislation” to future legislatures.  \nId. at 67. \n[¶52] Before he spoke to the constitutional convention, Professor Cooley wrote \nin  Constitutional  Limitations  it  “is  the  peculiar  province  of  the  judicial \ndepartment,” as opposed to the legislature, “to adjudicate upon, and protect, \nthe rights and interests of individual citizens, and to that end to construe and \napply  the  laws.”  Cooley,  supra,  at  *90.  Shortly  before  the  constitutional \nconvention, the United States Supreme Court also discussed the duty of the \n23 \n \n\n \n \njudiciary in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635 (1886), explaining courts \nmust be “watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any \nstealthy encroachment thereon.” Courts, it explained, must liberally construe \nprovisions protecting fundamental rights: \n[C]onstitutional provisions for the security of person and property \nshould  be  liberally  construed.  A  close  and  literal  construction \ndeprives  them  of  half  their  efficacy,  and  leads  to  gradual \ndepreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in \nsubstance. \nId. Based on this legal precedent, we can assume the drafters understood \ncourts would construe broadly descriptions protecting life, liberty, and security \nof a person liberally. They nonetheless chose at the outset to enshrine broad \nguarantees of freedom in N.D. Const. art. I, § 1. \n[¶53] Although the drafters of our constitution adopted the words Professor \nCooley used, one has since changed. On November 6, 1984, the people of this \nState approved an initiated measure that changed the word “men” in N.D. \nConst. art. I, § 1 to the word “individuals.” See MKB Mgmt. Corp. v. Burdick, \n2014 ND 197, ¶¶ 88-89, 855 N.W.2d 31 (opinion of Kapsner, J.) (discussing the \namendment). The people clarified in writing what the drafters omitted—that \nwomen are born with the same natural and inalienable rights as men. N.D. \nConst. art. I, § 1. \n[¶54] We view the question before us through this lens. Our reading of the \nConstitution requires a recognition that the drafters did not set out to delineate \nin Article I, § 1 the specific rights it protects and to exclude others. Rather, the \nlimitations  placed  on  the  legislature  in  Article  I,  §  1  arise  by  necessary \nimplication. By its nature, the Constitution was meant to “define the limits” of \nthe State’s exercise of power “so as to protect individual rights, and shield them \nagainst the assumption of arbitrary power.”  Cooley, supra, at *3. The rights \nmentioned in Article I, § 1 are “among” those “certain inalienable rights” that \n“all individuals” possess “by nature.” Id. For example, the Constitution does \nnot specifically identify a number of fundamental rights, and yet this Court \nhas recognized the same. See Hoff v. Berg, 1999 ND 115, ¶¶ 8-18, 595 N.W.2d \n24 \n \n\n \n \n285 (stating parents have a fundamental right to parent their children); State \nex rel. Schuetzle v. Vogel, 537 N.W.2d 358, 360-64 (N.D. 1995) (recognizing \nliberty interest to refuse unwanted medical treatment); Johnson v. Elkin, 263 \nN.W.2d 123, 129-30 (N.D. 1978) (identifying liberty right to engage in ordinary \noccupation without state regulation). \n[¶55] While I agree, and have signed with the majority, I write separately to \nrecognize analysis of the state constitution will not always parallel analysis of \nthe federal constitution. See State v. Kordonowy, 2015 ND 197, ¶ 14, 867 \nN.W.2d 690 (“A state may grant greater protections than the United States \nConstitution through its own constitution”); see also Riemers v. Eslinger, 2010 \nND 76, ¶ 18, 781 N.W.2d 632 (same); State v. Nordquist, 309 N.W.2d 109, 113 \n(N.D. 1981) (same); State v. Matthews, 216 N.W.2d 90, 99 (N.D. 1974) (same). \nIn addition, while we have only narrowly considered the fundamental right to \nan  abortion  “at  least  in  the  limited  instances  of  life-saving  and  health \npreserving  circumstances,”  Majority,  at  ¶  40,  the  district  court  is  free  to \nconsider whether additional fundamental rights are implicated by the statute \nunder  N.D.  Const.  art.  I,  §  1,  or  any  other  constitutional  provision.  For \nexample, while the parties have not addressed N.D. Const. art. I, § 25, which \nprovides comprehensive constitutional rights for victims of crimes, the rights \nfound therein may be implicated nonetheless by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12. \n[¶56] Daniel J. Crothers  \nLisa Fair McEvers \nDaniel D. Narum, D.J. \n[¶57] Justice Gerald W. VandeWalle was not a member of the Court when this \nopinion was considered and did not participate in the decision.

Less than six weeks after the North Dakota Supreme Court recognized that the state \nConstitution protects “a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve [a patient’s] life or her \nhealth,” Wrigley v. Romanick, 2023 ND 50, ¶ 27, 988 N.W.2d 231, 242, the Legislative Assembly \nenacted  yet  another  extreme,  total  abortion  ban  that  flagrantly  violates  this  constitutional \nguarantee. Senate Bill 2150 (“S.B. 2150” or the “Amended Abortion Ban”)1 prevents pregnant \npeople from accessing necessary, time-sensitive healthcare and threatens their lives, health, and \nfertility.  Openly  flouting  the  Supreme  Court’s  recent  decision  in  this  case,  the  Legislative \nAssembly drafted language for medical exceptions that is incomprehensible to physicians and \nincompatible with the Supreme Court’s holding. \n3.  Pregnant North Dakotans have a fundamental right to access life- and health-\npreserving care in their home state. Wrigley v. Romanick, 2023 ND 50, ¶ 27, 988 N.W.2d at 242. \nThe Amended Abortion Ban, like the laws that it replaced, prevents them from doing so. While \nthe Amended Abortion Ban has an exception for “health,” the exception is too narrow to allow \npregnant people to access care in situations where their health is at risk. For example, the exception \nprohibits abortions to treat the most common underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the \nUnited States—mental health conditions—despite the long history and tradition of recognizing \nthat abortion care may be necessary to preserve a person’s mental health. See id. at ¶ 23. Moreover, \nthe Amended Abortion Ban has no exception to allow abortions for patients with pregnancies \n \n1 A copy of Senate Bill 2150 is attached as Exhibit A. This action challenges only section 1 of S.B. \n2150, which creates a new section within title 12.1 of the North Dakota Century Code. \n  2 \n\n \nwhere the fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy and sustain life after birth, even though \ncontinuing the pregnancy carries additional risks for the pregnant person or for another fetus in a \nmultifetal pregnancy.2 As a result, pregnant North Dakotans carrying such pregnancies must leave \nthe state and bear additional financial and logistical costs if they choose to access abortion care. \nFor people who are unable to travel out of state, the Amended Abortion Ban forces them to \ncontinue the pregnancy and assume unnecessary risks to their lives, health, and future fertility.  \n4.  The Amended Abortion Ban fails to provide a discernible standard for when \nphysicians may legally provide abortion care. In particular, the health exception does not allow \nphysicians to rely on their own good faith medical determinations about the proper treatment for \ntheir patients. Instead, it holds them to a vague standard with both objective and subjective \nelements that is impossible to apply to real-world medical scenarios. Because the standards for \nwhen it is legal to provide abortion care are so unclear, physicians who provide abortions are at \nrisk of arbitrary or discriminatory prosecution if law enforcement questions their medical decisions \nafter the fact. Due process demands greater clarity in a criminal statute than the Amended Abortion \nBan provides. \n5.  Furthermore, because of the legal uncertainty that it creates for physicians, the \nAmended Abortion Ban threatens to reduce the healthcare available to all people in the state, \nregardless of their pregnancy desires or outcomes. Pregnancy carries health risks in any situation, \nand these risks are higher when healthcare is unavailable. Indeed, most pregnancy-related deaths \n \n2 Plaintiffs here challenge the prohibition of abortion as applied to pregnancies where, due to a \nfetal condition or diagnosis, there is little to no chance of the fetus surviving the pregnancy and \nsustaining life after birth, or where a fetal condition poses risks to a pregnant person’s health. \nPlaintiffs do not seek an exception for other fetal genetic conditions. \n  3 \n\n \nmay be preventable if patients receive necessary care and treatment.3 But in states with restrictive \nabortion laws, physicians are fleeing to avoid the legal risk of practicing in a hostile state, forcing \nhospitals to stop providing obstetrical care.4 \n6.  Patients have a right to access health-preserving abortion care, and physicians must \nbe  able  to  provide  that  care  without  risking  their  liberty  and  a  prison  sentence.  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully ask this Court to find the criminal prohibition of abortion in the Amended Abortion \nBan void for vagueness and to issue any and all declaratory or injunctive relief necessary to protect \nthe health and lives of pregnant North Dakotans. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to N.D. Const. art. VI, § 8 and N.D. Cent. Code \n§ 27-05-06. \n8.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by N.D. Cent. \nCode §§ 32-06-02, 32-23-01 and by the general equitable powers of this Court. \n \n3 See generally Susanna Trost et al., Pregnancy-Related Deaths: Data from Maternal Mortality \nReview Committees in 36 US States, 2017-2019, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(2022), https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/docs/pdf/Pregnancy-Related-\nDeaths-Data-MMRCs-2017-2019-H.pdf (noting that maternal mortality review committees in 36 \nstates found that 84% of pregnancy-related deaths were preventable). \n4 See, e.g., Bonner General Health, Press Release 3/17/2023: Discontinuation of Labor & Delivery \nServices  at  Bonner  General  Hospital,  https://bonnergeneral.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2023/03/Bonner-General-Health-Press-Release-Closure-of-LD-3.17.2023.pdf \n(announcing the end of labor and delivery services and noting that “[h]ighly respected, talented \nphysicians are leaving.

Venue is appropriate under N.D. Cent. Code § 28-04-05 because Plaintiff Ana \nTobiasz practices in Burleigh County, and Defendants Drew H. Wrigley and Julie Lawyer are \nlocated in Burleigh County. \nPARTIES \nI.  Plaintiffs \n10.  Plaintiff Red River Women’s Clinic has been in operation since 1998. Until August \n2022, the Clinic operated in Fargo, North Dakota. The Clinic now provides abortions and other \nreproductive healthcare in Moorhead, Minnesota. The Clinic brings claims on behalf of itself and \nits patients. \n11.  The Clinic’s mission is to provide high-quality affordable abortion care and family \nplanning services to its patients. The Clinic’s physicians and staff are deeply committed to \nproviding abortion care and to ensuring that pregnant people have access to comprehensive \nreproductive  healthcare.  The  Clinic  provides  a  range  of  services,  including  abortions, \ncontraception, pregnancy testing, and sexually transmitted infection testing. The majority of the \nClinic’s patients are from North Dakota; for example, in 2021, when Red River Women’s Clinic \nwas the sole abortion clinic in North Dakota, approximately 73% of people who received abortions \nin the state were North Dakota residents.5 \n12.  Patients seek abortion care at Red River Women’s Clinic for a variety of reasons, \nincluding to preserve their lives and health. For example, “[s]ome patients have pregnancy-related \nhealth conditions, such as severe preeclampsia or anemia, which they believe would make it unsafe \nfor them to continue the pregnancy.” Decl. of Tammi Kromenaker (Dkt. #7), ¶ 11. “Other patients \n \n5 See ND Induced Termination of Pregnancy Data 2021, North Dakota Health & Human \nServices, 4 (2021), \nhttps://www.hhs.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/DOH%20Legacy/Vital/ITOP%202021.pdf. \n  5 \n\n \nwho [have] sought care at the Clinic have had health conditions unrelated to their pregnancies, \nsuch as back pain requiring surgery, but could not receive treatment for those conditions while \nthey were pregnant.” Id.  \n13.  Plaintiff Kathryn Eggleston, M.D., is a physician licensed to practice medicine in \nNorth Dakota and is the Medical Director of Red River Women’s Clinic. Dr. Eggleston has \nprovided abortion care at the Clinic since 2004 and has served as the Clinic’s Medical Director \nsince 2008. As Medical Director, Dr. Eggleston oversees the provision of all medical care at the \nClinic and provides both medication and surgical abortions to the Clinic’s patients. Dr. Eggleston \nbrings claims on behalf of herself and her patients. \n14.  Plaintiff Ana Tobiasz, M.D., is a maternal-fetal medicine physician licensed to \npractice medicine in North Dakota. Dr. Tobiasz practices in Bismarck. She is a Clinical Assistant \nProfessor in the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences’ Department \nof  Obstetrics  &  Gynecology,  and  vice-chair  of  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and \nGynecologists (“ACOG”) North Dakota section. As one of only five maternal-fetal medicine \nspecialists  in  the  state,  Dr.  Tobiasz  regularly  provides  care  for  patients  with  complicated \npregnancies, including patients with health conditions that are a contraindication to pregnancy and \npatients who receive a diagnosis of a fetal condition where the fetus is unlikely to survive the \npregnancy and sustain life after birth.6 Dr. Tobiasz also treats patients experiencing medical \ncomplications for whom inducing labor or terminating the pregnancy is the standard of care. When \nappropriate based on a patient’s health circumstances and personal beliefs, her practice includes \n \n6 Because North Dakota law has prohibited physicians from providing abortions based on a fetal \ngenetic condition since 2013, none of the Plaintiffs provide this care to patients in North Dakota \nwho receive a fetal diagnosis. See N.D. Cent. Code § 14-02.1-04.1 (repealed by S.B. 2150). \n  6 \n\n \ncounseling patients about termination of pregnancy and providing referrals for abortion. Dr. \nTobiasz brings claims on behalf of herself and her patients. \n15.  Plaintiff Erica Hofland, M.D., is a physician licensed to practice medicine in North \nDakota. She practices obstetrics and gynecology and has been providing obstetric care, including \ndelivery care, for the past ten years in Dickinson. Dr. Hofland serves as the vice-chair of the ACOG \nNorth Dakota section. Dr. Hofland treats patients for whom an abortion is health-preserving care, \nincluding patients who receive a diagnosis of a fetal condition where the fetus is unlikely to survive \nthe  pregnancy  and  sustain  life  after  birth.  She  also  treats  patients  experiencing  medical \nemergencies and complications for whom inducing labor or terminating the pregnancy is the \nstandard of care. Dr. Hofland brings claims on behalf of herself and her patients.  \n16.  Plaintiff Collette Lessard, M.D., is a physician licensed to practice medicine in \nNorth Dakota. She practices obstetrics and gynecology in Grand Forks and has been providing \nobstetric care, including miscarriage care and delivery care, for nearly ten years. She is a Clinical \nAssistant Professor at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine, and serves on the board \nof the North and South Dakota Perinatal Quality Collaborative and the North Dakota Society of \nObstetrics and Gynecology. Dr. Lessard treats patients for whom an abortion is health-preserving \ncare, including patients who receive a diagnosis of a fetal condition where the fetus is unlikely to \nsurvive the pregnancy and sustain life after birth. She also treats patients experiencing medical \nemergencies and complications for whom inducing labor or terminating the pregnancy is the \nstandard of care. Dr. Lessard brings claims on behalf of herself and her patients. \n17.  Plaintiff Brendan Boe, M.D., Pharm.D., is a physician licensed to practice medicine \nin North Dakota. He practices obstetrics and gynecology in Grand Forks. Dr. Boe treats patients \nfor whom an abortion is health-preserving care, including patients who receive a diagnosis of a \n  7 \n\n \nfetal condition where the fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy and sustain life after birth. He \nalso treats patients experiencing medical emergencies and complications for whom inducing labor \nor terminating the pregnancy is the standard of care. Dr. Boe brings claims on behalf of himself \nand his patients. \nII.  Defendants \n18.  Defendant Drew. H. Wrigley is the State’s Attorney General. The Attorney General \nmust “[a]ppear and defend all actions against any state officer,” and “advise the several state’s \nattorneys in matters relating to the duties of their office.” N.D. Cent. Code § 54-12-01. The \nAttorney General is also “authorized to institute and prosecute all cases in which the state is a \nparty, whenever in their judgment it would be for the best interests of the state so to do.” N.D. \nCent. Code § 54-12-02. He is sued in his official capacity. \n19.  Defendant Kimberlee Jo Hegvik is the State’s Attorney for Cass County. The \nState’s Attorney’s office is charged with prosecuting all public offenses on behalf of the State of \nNorth Dakota. N.D. Cent. Code § 11-16-01(1). She is sued in her official capacity. \n20.  Defendant Julie Lawyer is the State’s Attorney for Burleigh County. The State’s \nAttorney’s office is charged with prosecuting all public offenses on behalf of the State of North \nDakota. N.D. Cent. Code § 11-16-01(1). She is sued in her official capacity. \n21.  Defendant Amanda Engelstad is the State’s Attorney for Stark County.

Cent. Code § 11-16-01(1). She is sued in her official capacity. \n  8 \n\n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Amended Abortion Ban Prohibits Providing Abortions With Three Extremely \nNarrow Exceptions. \n23.  North Dakota’s “Trigger Ban,” N.D. Cent. Code § 12.1-31-12, banned abortion for \nany reason, with no exceptions. See Complaint (Dkt. #2), ¶¶ 29-30. The Trigger Ban  was \npreliminarily enjoined in an order of this Court. Order on Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (Dkt. #95). \n \n24.  On March 16, 2023, the North Dakota Supreme Court unanimously denied the \nAttorney General’s request to vacate the preliminary injunction of the Trigger Ban. See Judgment \n(Dkt. #118). The Supreme Court explained that, “[a]fter review of North Dakota’s history and \ntraditions, and the plain language of article I, section 1 of the North Dakota Constitution, it is clear \nthe citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain \nsafety, which necessarily includes [that] a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an \nabortion to preserve her life or her health.” Wrigley v. Romanick, 2023 ND 50, ¶ 27. \n25.  S.B. 2150 is a new, total abortion ban which repeals the Trigger Ban and several \nother duplicative, overlapping bans. Like the Trigger Ban, the Amended Abortion Ban makes it a \nclass C felony to perform an abortion. See S.B. 2150, § 1. A class C felony carries a maximum of \nfive years of imprisonment, a fine of $10,000, or both. See N.D. Cent. Code § 12.1-32-01.4. \n26.  As originally introduced in January 2023, S.B. 2150 would have amended the \nTrigger Ban without permitting abortions for health reasons unless the patient was experiencing a \nmedical emergency.7 But after the North Dakota Supreme Court issued its decision in this case, \nthe legislature, operating on a deadline, made certain changes to S.B. 2150. The legislature did not \nhold a public hearing on these amendments or give healthcare providers an opportunity to publicly \n \n7 See S.B. 5150, 68th Leg. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (N.D. Jan. 6, 2023), \nhttps://ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/documents/23-0137-05000.pdf.  \n  9 \n\n \ntestify to the practicalities of the standards in the bill. In modifying the law, the legislature moved \nthe Amended Abortion Ban to a new section of the Century Code, added the definition of “serious \nhealth risk” to the statute, and modified the first exception in the ban to allow physicians to provide \nabortions when a “serious health risk” is present. S.B. 2150, § 1. \n27.  The Amended Abortion Ban threatens to reduce healthcare access for all pregnant \nNorth Dakotans. Already, 19% of pregnant North Dakotans lack reliable access to prenatal care, \nand, as of 2020, North Dakota had the sixth highest proportion of people living in a maternity care \ndesert—counties without obstetric providers and facilities—of any state in the country.8 In other \nstates with restrictive abortion laws, physicians are leaving in record numbers, saying that they do \nnot want to prosecuted “simply for saving someone’s life”9 and “cannot continue to practice in a \nplace where I do not feel safe.”10 \n28.  During the floor debates on S.B. 2150, legislators correctly asserted that the law \n“does not comply with the North Dakota Supreme Court ruling”11 and urged their colleagues to \n \n8 North Dakota is the #6 State with the Most People Living in Maternal Health Care Deserts, \nSTACKER (Oct. 29, 2021), https://stacker.com/north-dakota/north-dakota-6-state-most-people-\nliving-maternal-health-care-deserts (using 2020 Census population data to calculate what \npercentage of a state’s population lives in “maternity care desert” based on March of Dimes’ \ndefinition).

Governor Doug Burgum signed the Amended Abortion Ban on April 24, 2023. It \nwent into effect that same day.14 \n30.  “Abortion” as used in the Amended Abortion Ban is defined as: \nthe act of using, selling, or prescribing any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other \nsubstance, device, or means with the intent to terminate the clinically diagnosable \npregnancy of a woman, including the elimination of one or more unborn children \nin a multifetal pregnancy, with knowledge the termination by those means will with \nreasonable  likelihood  cause  the  death  of  the  unborn  child.  The  use,  sale, \nprescription, or means is not an abortion if done with the intent to: \na.  Remove a dead unborn child caused by spontaneous abortion; \nb.  Treat a woman for an ectopic pregnancy; or \nc.  Treat a woman for a molar pregnancy. \n \nS.B. 2150, § 1.15 \n \n \n12 Second Reading and Roll Call on S.B. 2150 Before the H., 68th Leg.

Cent. Code § 14-02.1-02 (amended and reenacted by S.B. \n2150, § 3).  \n  11 \n\n \n31.  The Amended Abortion Ban provides three exceptions: (1) in cases of death or \nserious health risks (the “Serious Health Risk Exception”); (2) in sexual violence cases up to six \nweeks of pregnancy (the “Sex Offenses Exception”); and (3) for third parties acting under \nphysician supervision (the “Third Party Exception”). Id. \n32.  First, the Amended Abortion Ban has a Serious Health Risk Exception under which \nthe ban does not apply to “[a]n abortion deemed necessary based on reasonable medical judgment \nwhich was intended to prevent the death or a serious health risk to the pregnant female.” Id. \n“Serious health risk” is defined as:  \na  condition  that,  in  reasonable  medical  judgment,  complicates  the  medical \ncondition of the pregnant woman so that it necessitates an abortion to prevent \nsubstantial physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including any \npsychological or emotional condition. The term may not be based on a claim or \ndiagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct that will result in her death or in \nsubstantial physical impairment of a major bodily function.  \n \nId. § 1(5). “Reasonable medical judgment” is defined as “a medical judgment that would be made \nby a reasonably prudent physician who is knowledgeable about the case and the treatment \npossibilities with respect to the medical conditions involved.” Id. § 1(4). The bill does not define \n“major bodily function” aside from noting that it does not include any psychological or emotional \nconditions. \n33.  Second,  the  Amended  Abortion  Ban  has  an  extremely  narrow  Sex  Offenses \nException under which the ban does not apply to “[a]n abortion to terminate a pregnancy that based \non reasonable medical judgment resulted from gross sexual imposition, sexual imposition, sexual \nabuse of a ward, or incest, as those offenses are defined in chapter 12.1-20, if the probable \ngestational age of the unborn child is six weeks or less.” Id. § 1.  \n34.  Third, the Amended Abortion Ban has a Third-Party Exception under which the \nban does not apply to “[a]n individual assisting in performing an abortion if the individual was \n  12 \n\n \nacting within the scope of that individual’s regulated profession, was under the direction of or at \nthe direction of a physician, and did not know the physician was performing an abortion in \nviolation of this chapter.” Id. \nB.  The Amended Abortion Ban Is Unconstitutionally Vague. \n35.  Due process requires that a statute provide fair notice of what conduct is prohibited \nso that “persons of common intelligence” do not have to “guess at its meaning and differ as to its \napplication.” Peters-Riemers v. Riemers, 2001 ND 62, ¶ 20, 624 N.W.2d 83, 89 (internal citations \nomitted). In the context of abortion specifically, exceptions to abortion bans are unconstitutionally \nvague if “physicians cannot know the standard under which their conduct will ultimately be \njudged.” Women’s Med. Pro. Corp. v. Voinovich, 130 F.3d 187, 205 (6th Cir. 1997).  \n36.  The Amended Abortion Ban fails to provide adequate notice of when abortion is \npermitted or when it is prohibited. The use of vague, confusing, non-medical terminology in the \nexceptions  invites conflicting  interpretations of the law  and leaves physicians  who provide \nabortion care vulnerable to arbitrary prosecution.  \n37.  The Serious Health Risk Exception states that it applies to “[a]n abortion deemed \nnecessary based on reasonable medical judgment which was intended to prevent death or a serious \nhealth risk.” S.B. 2150, § 1. But nowhere does the statute explain who must “deem” that the \nabortion is necessary, or how a physician would know what the “reasonable medical judgment” of \na “reasonably prudent physician” in a particular circumstance would dictate.  \n38.  Further compounding the confusion, the exception combines both an objective \nstandard—“reasonable medical judgment” as determined by a “reasonably prudent physician”—\nand a subjective standard—“intended to prevent the death or a serious health risk” to the patient. \nIn other cases involving exceptions to abortion bans, courts have concluded that the combination \n  13 \n\n \nof an objective “reasonable medical judgment” and subjective “good faith” standard in this way \n“contains no scienter requirement. Therefore, a physician may act in good faith and yet still be \nheld criminally and civilly liable if, after the fact, other physicians determine that the physician’s \nmedical judgment was not reasonable.” Voinovich, 130 F.3d at 204.  \n39.  The concern that other physicians may second-guess one’s judgment is particularly \nheightened in the context of abortion care, because “[t]he determination of whether a medical \nemergency or necessity exists . . . is fraught with uncertainty and susceptible to being subsequently \ndisputed by others. . . . In an area as controversial as abortion, . . . where there is such disagreement, \nit is unlikely that the prosecution could not find a physician willing to testify that the physician did \nnot  act  reasonably.” Id.  at  205. For that reason, abortion bans which lack a clear scienter \nrequirement are “little more than ‘a trap for those who act in good faith.’” Colautti v. Franklin, \n439  U.S.  379,  395  (1979)  (quoting  United  States  v.  Ragen,  314  U.S.  513,  524  (1942)). \n“[I]mpos[ing] criminal liability without a mental culpability requirement” in this way renders an \nabortion ban unconstitutionally vague. Voinovich, 130 F.3d at 203-04. \n40.  The narrow Sex Offenses Exception is similarly confusing.16 Physicians are not \njudges or prosecutors, yet the Sex Offenses Exception requires them to determine, “based on \nreasonable medical judgment,” whether specific crimes have occurred and whether those crimes \n \n16 Because the Sex Offenses Exception limits care to the first six weeks of pregnancy, very few \nsurvivors of sexual violence would be able to access such care. Many people do not know that they \nare pregnant within the first six weeks of pregnancy, which may be only two weeks after a person’s \nfirst missed period. Lauren J. Ralph et al., Home pregnancy test use and timing of pregnancy \nconfirmation  among  people  seeking  health  care,  107  Contraception  10  (Mar.  2022), \nhttps://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(21)00438-8/fulltext.  For  survivors  of \nrape, studies estimate that about a third of rape victims do not discover they are pregnant until the \nsecond  trimester  (around  fourteen  weeks  of  pregnancy)—several  weeks  after  the  six-week \ndeadline  imposed  by  the  Amended  Abortion  Ban.  Melisa  M.  Holmes  et  al.,  Rape-Related \nPregnancy: Estimates and Descriptive Characteristics from a National Sample of Women, 175 \nAm. J. Obstetrics & Gynecology 320 (1996).  \n  14 \n\n \nresulted in a pregnancy before they can provide abortion care to survivors of sexual violence. But \nit is not clear how a “reasonably prudent physician” would discern whether a patient’s pregnancy \nresulted from “gross sexual imposition,” “sexual imposition,” “sexual abuse of a ward,” or \n“incest.” Indeed, the elements of these crimes, as defined in chapter 12.1-20, include evidence that \na physician would have no way of knowing, such as whether a perpetrator acted with knowledge \nor “reasonable cause to believe that the victim is unaware that a sexual act is being committed \nupon him or her,” or whether the perpetrator compelled the victim “to submit to force or by threat \nof imminent death” or “by any threat or coercion that would render a person reasonably incapable \nof  resisting.”  N.D.  Cent.  Code  §§  12.1-20-03  to  -04.  Physicians  do  not  have  resources  to \ninvestigate crimes, and even the most well-resourced police departments and prosecutors’ offices, \nworking in conjunction, may require more than a few weeks to determine whether they have \nsufficient evidence to support one of the enumerated crimes.

The Amended Abortion Ban Violates the Rights of Pregnant Patients by Denying \nThem Health-Preserving Care. \ni.  The Serious Health Risk Exception Chills the Provision of Care in Many \nSituations Where A Patient’s Physical Health is At Risk. \n42.  “North Dakota has a long history of permitting women to obtain abortions to \npreserve their life or health.” Wrigley v. Romanick, 2023 ND 50, ¶ 23. As the Supreme Court \nrecently noted, “[m]edical journals published shortly after statehood indicate it was common \nknowledge that an abortion could be performed to preserve the life or health of the woman.” Id. at \n¶ 25. As one medical journal from that time explained,  \n[t]here are not infrequently cases in which an abortion is imperative: the mentally \nunfit who might become deranged; the woman with a narrow brim or outlet because \nof which her life might be in danger and a Cesarean section is the only relief; the \nwoman who may bleed to death; the eclamptic; and those suffering from dangerous \ndiseases.  \nId. (quoting Criminal Abortions, 34 Journal-Lancet 81, 82 (1914) (emphasis added)). Then, as \nnow, medical professionals recognized that abortion is necessary healthcare.  \n43.  The Serious Health Risk Exception infringes on the inalienable rights of patients \nby chilling providers from offering health-preserving abortion care and thus making that care \nunavailable to patients. Vague exceptions to abortion bans which permit care only when an \nunknown person deems that care “necessary” discourage physicians from providing abortion care \nin situations where a patient’s life or health is at risk but where the risk cannot be easily quantified. \nSee United States v. Idaho, 623 F.Supp.3d 1096, 1104 (D. Idaho 2022) (finding, in discussing an \nIdaho abortion ban, that “[d]espite the risks [various] conditions present, it is not always possible \n  16 \n\n \nfor a physician to know whether treatment for any particular condition, at any particular moment \nin time, is ‘necessary to prevent the death’ of the pregnant patient…”), reconsideration denied, \nNo. 1:22-CV-00329-BLW, 2023 WL 3284977 (D. Idaho May 4, 2023).18 Similarly, under the \nAmended Abortion Ban, even if a physician and patient agree that an abortion is necessary to \npreserve the patient’s health, due to the ambiguity in the Serious Health Risk Exception, physicians \nwill be reluctant to provide that care, and patients may not be able to obtain an abortion. \n44.  Many medical conditions pose a significant, but uncertain, risk to a person’s health \nduring pregnancy for which obtaining an abortion would be health-preserving care. Being pregnant \ncan cause or exacerbate a chronic condition. For example, preexisting heart disease can put a \npregnant patient at significant risks for health complications.19 Cardiovascular conditions are \namong the leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. and are the leading cause of \npregnancy-related death for Black women.20 For many patients, heart conditions which may have \ncaused little or no symptoms prior to pregnancy can become a threat to their health due to the \nsignificant physiological changes that happen during pregnancy, such as increase in blood volume, \n \n18 See also Lisa H.

Similarly, certain cancers requiring radiation, chemotherapy, or major surgery; \ndiabetes; renal diseases; certain cardiac, autoimmune, respiratory, or endocrine diseases; certain \ncases of hyperemesis gravidarum; and certain psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder, major \ndepressive  disorder,  anxiety  disorders,  and  psychotic  disorders  can  all  be  exacerbated  by \npregnancy, depending on the circumstances.  \n46.  Pregnancy may also prevent patients from accessing treatment for chronic or \nserious conditions if that treatment is unsafe while pregnant. As an example, some breast cancer \npatients may not be able to begin or continue treatment while pregnant—and about 40% of \npregnant cancer patients have breast cancer.23 “[M]any targeted systemic therapies for breast \ncancer are explicitly contraindicated in pregnancy, which leaves traditional chemotherapy as the \nonly option for many pregnant patients.”24 In the first trimester, chemotherapy may not be \nappropriate or safe for the embryo or fetus, potentially creating major malformations or fetal loss.25 \n \n21 See Iftikhar & Biswas, supra note 19.  \n22 Id.  \n23 Nicole T.

Many medications used to treat other chronic conditions, such as high cholesterol \nor panic disorders, may not be safe to take during pregnancy because they may pose a risk to a \ndeveloping embryo or fetus.27 For patients who take those drugs who become pregnant, they must \ndecide either to continue taking a necessary medication and risk harm to the embryo or fetus, stop \ntaking the drug and risk harm to themselves, or terminate the pregnancy. \n48.  For patients with heart disease, cancer, high cholesterol, or any number of chronic \nor serious conditions, a patient and her physician may believe that an abortion is necessary to \npreserve the patient’s health. But because of the Amended Abortion Ban’s chilling effect, even \npatients with serious and potentially life-threatening medical conditions may be unable to obtain \nan abortion in North Dakota. \n49.  Moreover, the Serious Health Risk Exception denies patients autonomy over their \nhealthcare decisions. Patients, not physicians, decide whether and to what extent to tolerate \nmedical risks. Physicians inform patients of the risks of obtaining, deferring, or declining medical \ncare. The patient can choose to seek a second (or third or fourth) opinion if they like.

Such  interference  is  contrary  to  the  appropriate  exercise  of \nprofessional judgment that medical professionals need to exercise to protect patients’ well-being. \nThe AMA recently updated its Principles of Medical Ethics to clarify that in the context of \nabortion, “physicians must have latitude to act in accord with their best professional judgment” \nand be “expressly permitt[ed]…to perform abortions in keeping with good medical practice.”28 \nThe AMA also states that, “[l]ike all health care decisions, a decision to terminate a pregnancy \nshould be made privately within the relationship of trust between patient and physician in keeping \nwith the patient’s unique values and needs and the physician’s best professional judgment.”29  \nii.

Mental health is the most frequent underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths in \nthe United States.39 Indeed, approximately 23% of pregnancy-related deaths are associated with \nmental health conditions, including deaths caused by suicide and substance use disorder.40   \n55.  Patients who have previously experienced perinatal mental health conditions are at \nhigher risk of experiencing those same conditions in a subsequent pregnancy.41 For example, \npatients with a history of postpartum depression have a 20-25% risk of having another depressive \nepisode  with  a  future  pregnancy.42  Likewise,  patients  who  have  experienced  postpartum \npsychosis—a serious condition that can be life-threatening—have a greater than 50% risk of \nexperiencing a recurrence in a future pregnancy.43 Given the high risk of recurrence of these \ndisorders, people with a history of serious perinatal mental health conditions may determine that \nit is necessary to terminate a pregnancy to preserve their mental health.  \n56.  Additionally, some medications used to treat common psychiatric conditions may \ncause serious congenital malformations in the fetus, yet are necessary for maintaining the pregnant \nperson’s mental health.44 For example, lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder, is associated \n \n39 Trost, supra note 3.  \n40 See id. \n41 “Perinatal” refers to the period immediately before and after birth.

Physicians have described the harm that abortion bans cause to patients with \nunderlying mental health conditions for whom providing an abortion would preserve their mental \nhealth. For example, one physician described treating a patient who had to travel out of state for \nabortion care, a preventable hardship that undermined her psychological and economic safety: \n[The patient] traveled on an airplane for the first time ever, . . . using her whole \npaycheck to buy tickets, rent a hotel. . . . She was raped two months ago. Each \nepisode of morning sickness causes [post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms] so \nintense she tried to take her life yesterday. If abortion was legal in her home state, \nseveral things would be different 1) she could have accessed an abortion more \npromptly 2) perhaps therefore she wouldn’t have had an escalation of PTSD such \nthat she tried to kill herself, [and] 3) she’d have more money in her bank account, \n \n45 Carrie Armstrong, ACOG Guidelines on Psychiatric Medicine Use During Pregnancy and \nLactation, 78 Am.

I fear she won’t \nhave money to return and get her abortion. I fear she could kill herself first.”51 \n58.  In recent legal challenges to restrictive abortion bans, physicians have explained \nthe need to allow for abortion care to preserve a patient’s mental health and the severe risks for \npatients when abortion care is not available. For example, in one case, a physician testified that \nshe had a patient who experienced “debilitating postpartum psychosis” after the birth of a child. \nThe  physician  described  the  patient’s  symptoms  as  “excruciating”  and  noted  the  “strong \nassociation between postpartum psychosis and maternal suicide.” After the patient’s condition had \nimproved, she unintentionally became pregnant again. Her physician testified,  \nShe was gravely concerned about either stopping her medication during pregnancy \nand experiencing a worsening of her bipolar disorder, or continuing her medication \nand exposing the fetus to serious teratogenic risks. But even more than that, she \nwas  terrified  at  the  thought  of  experiencing  postpartum  psychosis  again  and \npotentially hurting her child or herself. This patient told me repeatedly that she felt \nsuch overwhelming distress at the thought of continuing the pregnancy that she \nwould rather die than go on.52  \n \n \n49 Grossman et al., supra note 4, at 12. \n50 Id. \n51 Id. \n52 Aff. of Samantha Meltzer-Brody, M.D. ¶¶ 40-41, SisterSong Women of Color Reprod.

Pregnant North Dakotans have a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve \ntheir mental health. See Wrigley v. Romanick, 2023 ND 50, ¶ 25 (listing “the mentally unfit who \nmight become deranged” among conditions where abortion is medically necessary care) (quoting \nCriminal Abortions, 34 Journal-Lancet 81, 82 (1914)). And the state of North Dakota has an \ninterest in preventing patient suicide. State ex rel. Schuetzle v. Vogel, 537 N.W.2d 358, 360 (N.D. \n1995). That interest is subordinate to a patient’s own right to bodily autonomy. Id. With the \nAmended Abortion Ban, the government is failing to fulfill its duty to the state and people of North \nDakota  by  disregarding  the  state  interest  in  reducing  patient  suicide  while  simultaneously \noverriding individual patients’ bodily autonomy. \niii. The  Amended  Abortion  Ban  Prohibits  Abortion  Even  When  Ending  the \nPregnancy Would Preserve the Health of the Pregnant Person and When \nThere is Little to No Possibility of Fetal Survival. \n \n60.  The Amended Abortion Ban has no exception to allow patients to end pregnancies \nwhere there is little to no possibility of fetal survival, even though certain fetal conditions or \ndiagnoses may place the pregnant person’s health at risk. There are many conditions where the \nfetus either will not survive to birth or likely will not survive more than a few hours or days after \nbirth, including neural tube defects (including anencephaly); certain trisomies (the presence of an \nextra chromosome) like trisomy 13 and 18; triploidy (the presence of an extra set of chromosomes); \ncertain gastric and cardiac conditions in the fetus; and Potter Syndrome (where the fetus does not \n \n53 See, e.g., Aff. of Dr. Sharon Liner ¶ 11, Preterm-Cleveland v.

Patients with such pregnancies may choose abortion, which is \nmedically safer and preserves the patients’ health, rather than carrying the pregnancy to term and \nbirthing a baby that will not survive. \n61.  Carrying a pregnancy to term and experiencing childbirth come with higher risks \nfor morbidity and mortality than having an abortion. The mortality rate associated with childbirth \nin the United States is approximately 14 times higher than that associated with abortion.54 And \nstudies have demonstrated that banning abortion would increase maternal mortality.55  \n62.  Many of the most dangerous pregnancy complications, such as pregnancy-induced \nhypertension and placental abnormalities, arise later in pregnancy. See Decl. of Mark Nichols (Dkt. \n#8), ¶ 15. And “[a]lmost half of vaginal and caesarean deliveries are associated with at least one \nmedical complication, including hemorrhage, infection, injury to pelvic and abdominal organs and \nmuscles, and creation of scar tissue.” Id. at ¶16. Early termination of the pregnancy reduces the \npatient’s risk of experiencing these serious complications or conditions.  \n63.  Some fetal conditions pose particularly acute risks to the pregnant person. For \nexample, mirror syndrome is an emergent complication of pregnancy where both the pregnant \n \n54 Elizabeth G.

Terminating the pregnancy resolves the risk \nto the patient.56 \n64.  Likewise, terminating a pregnancy due to a fetal condition or diagnosis may be \nparticularly important in multifetal pregnancies. In multifetal pregnancies, a fetal condition in one \nor more of the fetuses can lead to an emergent condition where selective abortion (sometimes \ncalled selective “fetal reduction” or “fetal termination”) is necessary to give the pregnant person \nand the remaining fetus(es) the best chance of survival.57 For example, “in some cases (e.g. \ncomplications of monochorionic twins) failure to perform [fetal reduction] could result in the loss \nof both twins.”58  \n65.  North Dakotans have publicly testified about the importance of allowing pregnant \npeople to make their own determinations about abortion in cases where a fetus is unlikely to \nsurvive or sustain life after birth. Rebecca Matthews testified against S.B. 2150 and shared the \nstory of her third pregnancy from over 15 years ago. Rebecca was pregnant with identical twin \ngirls who shared a placenta and had a rare condition called twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. In \n2007, she traveled out of state and was contemplating whether to terminate one twin to save the \nother. Rebecca described this time as a “living hell,” “spent in prayer” accompanied by her two \nchildren. She described how she “learned to lean on [her] Maternal Fetal Medicine doctor and \n \n56 See Caroline Ruth Mathias et al., The diagnostic conundrum of maternal mirror syndrome \nprogressing to pre-eclampsia, 23 Case Reps. in Women’s Health e00122 (Jul. 2019), \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6542765/. \n57 Practice Bulletin 231: Multifetal Gestations Twins Triplet and Higher-Order Multifetal \nPregnancies, Am.

And while she was grateful that she could “navigate all the options available” to her, \nshe eventually lost both twins and delivered them stillborn.59 \n66.  Another North Dakotan, Mandy Dendy, discovered halfway through her  first \npregnancy that the fetus had no kidneys—a condition called Potter Syndrome, for which there are \nno treatments. Mandy and her husband had to decide whether to “carry a child that was given no \nchance of survival . . . or terminate the pregnancy.” Hoping her son would survive, she decided to \ncarry her pregnancy to term. Just in case, she arranged for a priest to baptize her son in the delivery \nroom, and for a funeral and burial. Around week thirty-seven of pregnancy, she delivered her son. \nWithin hours of birth, he died. Mandy has experienced this twice; during her fifth pregnancy, she \nagain learned that her fetus had Potter Syndrome and again chose to carry the pregnancy to term. \nHighlighting the importance of having a choice, she said, “we don’t regret the choices we made in \ncarrying our sons to term despite both of them dying within hours of their births. Having a choice \nin a situation where you have such little control is important.”60   \n67.

(finding, in a case involving a \nsimilar law, that “[w]hen the potential life is found to have a diagnosable genetic defect that is \nincompatible with life, the Court could find that the [law] is beyond a reasonable doubt, not related \nto a legitimate government interest”).  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim for Relief \n(Due Process/Void for Vagueness) \n69.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 68 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n70.  The  Amended  Abortion  Ban’s  vague  language  violates  the  North  Dakota \nConstitution’s guarantee that a person will not be deprived of their fundamental rights without due \nprocess of law, as guaranteed by N.D. Const., art. I, § 12. “A statute which either forbids or requires \nthe doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at \nits meaning and differ as to its application violates . . . due process of law.” In Int. of D.D., 2018 \nND 201, ¶ 7, 916 N.W.2d 765, 768 (N.D. 2018) (quoting Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. \n385 (1926)).  \n71.  The Amended Abortion Ban does not provide notice of whether, when, or how its \nexceptions apply in a variety of situations common in pregnancy, because it: (1) fails to use clear \nand unambiguous language to describe each of the exceptions; (2) describes the exceptions in \ncontradictory and impossible to apply ways by forcing physicians to guess at what a “reasonably \nprudent physician” would do (in the case of the Serious Health Risk Exception) or to determine \nwhether a crime has been committed (in the case of the Sex Offenses Exception); and (3) in the \n  31 \n\n \ncase of the Serious Health Exception, improperly combines an objective and subjective standard. \nAs a result of these defects, providers may be prosecuted under the Amended Abortion Ban even \nif they act in good faith based on their best medical judgment and the standard of care. \nSecond Claim for Relief \n(Right to Life and Safety – Right to Health-Preserving Care) \n72.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 71 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n73.  The North  Dakota Constitution  guarantees all  people the inalienable right of \n“enjoying and defending life and liberty” and “pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.” N.D. \nConst. art. I, § 1. “These rights implicitly include the right to obtain an abortion to preserve the \nwoman’s life or health.” Wrigley v. Romanick, 2023 ND 50, ¶ 22. The due process language in art. \nI, § 12 of the Constitution “protects and insures the use and enjoyment of the rights declared” by \nart. I, § 1. State v. Cromwell, 72 N.D. 565, 575, 9 N.W.2d 914, 919 (1943). \n74.  While “the legislature can regulate abortion, it must do so in a manner that is \nnarrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest.” Wrigley v. Romanick, 2023 ND 50, ¶ 30. \n75.  The Amended Abortion Ban unconstitutionally deprives Plaintiffs’ patients of their \nright to life and safety under art. I, § 1 and art. I, § 12 of the Constitution of the State of North \nDakota by chilling the provision of abortion care and by making abortions unavailable to pregnant \nNorth Dakotans who experience risks to their mental rather than physical health, even when the \nNorth Dakota Supreme Court has cited to the long history of recognizing that abortion may be \nnecessary to preserve a pregnant person’s mental health. Furthermore, the Amended Abortion Ban \nmust fail because there is no legitimate government interest in forcing pregnant people to assume \n  32 \n\n \nadditional health risks where the fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy and sustain life after \nbirth. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n76. Issue a judgment that the Amended Abortion Ban violates the Constitution of the State \nof North Dakota and is void for vagueness and of no effect;  \n77. Issue a judgment against Defendants granting appropriate declaratory relief to clarify \nthe scope of the exceptions to the Amended Abortion Ban consistent with the North \nDakota Constitution; \n78. Issue a judgment that the Amended Abortion Ban, as applied to pregnant people with \nmental health conditions and people carrying pregnancies where the fetus is unlikely \nto  survive  the  pregnancy  and  sustain  life  after  birth,  violates  the  North  Dakota \nConstitution; \n79. Issue permanent injunctive relief that restrains Defendants, their agents, servants, \nemployees,  attorneys,  and  any  persons  in  active  concert  or  participation  with \nDefendants, from enforcing the Amended Abortion Ban or instituting disciplinary \nactions related to  alleged violations of the  Amended Abortion  Ban in  a manner \nviolating the Court’s judgment; and \n80.

Parental consent or judicial authorization for abortion of unmarried minor - \nStatement of intent.\nThe legislative assembly intends to encourage unmarried pregnant minors to seek the advice and \ncounsel of their parents when faced with the difficult decision of whether or not to bear a child, to foster \nparental involvement in the making of that decision when parental involvement is in the best interests of \nthe minor and to do so in a manner that does not unduly burden the right to seek an abortion.\n1. NoA person may not knowingly perform an abortion upon a pregnant woman under the age of \neighteen years unless:\na. The attending physician has secured the written consent of the minor woman and both \nparents, if living, or the surviving parent if one parent is deceased, or the custodial parent \nif the parents are separated or divorced, or the legal guardian or guardians if the minor is \nsubject to guardianship;\n\nS.

A court may change the venue of proceedings \nunder this section to another county only upon finding that a transfer is required in the best \ninterests of the minor. All applications in accordance with this section must be heard by a \njuvenile judge or referee within forty-eight hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of receipt \nof the application. The juvenile judge or referee shall find by clear and convincing evidence:\na.

If the minor is not sufficiently mature and well informed to choose intelligently among the \nalternatives without the advice and counsel of her parents or guardian, whether or not it \nwould be in the best interests of the minor to notify her parents or guardian of the \nproceedings and call in the parents or guardian to advise and counsel the minor and aid \nthe court in making its determination and to assist the minor in making her decision.\nc. If the minor is not sufficiently mature and well informed to choose intelligently among the \nalternatives and it is found not to be in the best interests of the minor to notify and call in \nher parents or guardian for advice and counsel, whether an abortion or some other \nalternative would be in the best interests of the minor.\n3.

Following the hearing and the court's inquiry of the minor, the court shall issue one of the \nfollowing orders:\na. If the minor is sufficiently mature and well informed concerning the alternatives and \nwithout the need for further information, advice, or counseling, the court shall issue an \norder authorizing a competent physician to perform the abortion procedure on the minor.\nb. If the minor is not sufficiently mature and well informed, the court may:\n(1) Issue an order to provide the minor with any necessary information to assist her in \nher decision if the minor is mature enough to make the decision but not well \ninformed enough to do so.\n(2) Issue an order to notify the minor's parents or guardian of the pendency of the \nproceedings and calling for their attendance at a reconvening of the hearing in order \n\nS.

The minor or next friend may appeal the determination of the juvenile court directly to the state \nsupreme court. In the event of such an appeal, any and all orders of the juvenile court must be \nautomatically stayed pending determination of the issues on appeal. Any appeal taken \npursuant to this section by anyone other than the minor or next friend must be taken within \nforty-eight hours of the determination of the juvenile court by the filing of written notice with the \njuvenile court and a written application in the supreme court. Failure to file notice and \napplication within the prescribed time results in a forfeiture of the right to appeal and render \nthe juvenile court order or orders effective for all intents and purposes.\n7. Upon receipt of written notice of appeal, the juvenile court shall immediately cause to be \ntransmitted to the supreme court the record of proceedings had in the juvenile court.\n8. An application for appeal pursuant to this section must be treated as an expedited appeal by \nthe supreme court and must be set down for hearing within four days of receipt of the \napplication, excluding Saturdays and Sundays.\n9. The hearing, inquiry, and determination of the supreme court must be limited to a \ndetermination of the sufficiency of the inquiry and information considered by the juvenile court \nand whether or not the order or orders of the juvenile court accord with the information \nconsidered with respect to the maturity and information available to the minor and the best \ninterests of the minor as determined by the juvenile court. The determination of the juvenile \ncourt may not be overturned unless found to be clearly erroneous.\n10. After hearing the matter the supreme court shall issue its decision within twenty-four hours.\n11.

Plaintiffs Access Independent Health Services, Inc., doing business as Red River \nWomen’s Clinic (the “Clinic”), and Kathryn Eggleston, M.D., by and through their undersigned \nattorneys, bring this complaint against the above-named defendants, their employees, agents, and \nsuccessors in office, and in support thereof allege the following:  \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n2.  This is a civil rights action challenging certain provisions of North Dakota Century \nCode Section 12.1-31-12 (the “Abortion Ban” or the “Statute”), under the Constitution and laws \nof the State of North Dakota. A copy of the Statute is attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n3.  The Abortion Ban was enacted by the legislature and signed by the Governor during \nthe 2007 legislative session as House Bill 1466 (“H.B. 1466”), and will take effect 30 days after \nthe Attorney General, a Defendant in this case, certifies to the North Dakota legislative council the \n \n \n\nissuance of the judgment in a case from the United States Supreme Court “which, in whole or in \npart, restores to the states authority to prohibit abortion.”1  \n4.  On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392, 2022 WL 2276808 (U.S. June 24, 2022) (“Dobbs”), \nwhich overruled Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. \nv. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). \n5.  That  same  day,  North  Dakota  Governor  Doug  Burgum  issued  a  statement \nproclaiming that the Governor’s office “will now work diligently with the North Dakota Attorney \nGeneral’s Office to fulfill our constitutional duty by carrying out the 2007 legislation that is \ntriggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade.”2 \n6.  On June 28, 2022, Attorney General Wrigley wrote to the legislative council that \n“the preconditions for enforcement of [the Abortion Ban] have been satisfied, and this provision \nshall be given its full effect on July 28, 2022, the thirtieth day after the date of this certification \nletter.”3 \n7.  The Abortion Ban violates the rights of the Clinic, its patients, and Dr. Eggleston \nbecause it prohibits all abortions with only narrow exceptions and violates the rights of patients \n \n1 The effective date of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12 was amended by House Bill 1546 (“H.B. 1546”), \nenacted and signed during the 2019 legislative session. \n2 Press Release, North Dakota Office of the Governor, Burgum Releases Statement on U.S. \nSupreme Court Opinion That Returns Abortion Issue to the States (June 24, 2022), \nhttps://www.governor.nd.gov/news/burgum-releases-statement-us-supreme-court-opinion-\nreturns-abortion-issue-states. \n3 Letter from Drew H. Wrigley, Attorney General of the State of North Dakota, to John \nBjornson, Director of the North Dakota Legislative Council (June 28, 2022), \nhttps://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/sites/ag/files/documents/MediaAttachments/John%20Bjornson-\nLegislativeCouncil.pdf.  \n  2 \n \n\nseeking abortions. Further, Attorney General Wrigley’s certification is premature, as, to date, the \nSupreme Court has not issued its judgment in Dobbs. \n8.  Plaintiffs  therefore  urgently  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  barring \nDefendants and their agents from enforcing the Abortion Ban and allowing Plaintiffs to continue \nto provide abortion care in North Dakota. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to N.D. Const. Art. VI, § 8 and N.D.C.C. § 27-\n05-06. \n10.  Plaintiff’s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by N.D.C.C. \n§§ 32-06-02, 32-23-01 and by the general equitable powers of this Court. \n11.  Venue is appropriate under N.D.C.C. § 28-04-05 because Defendant Drew H. \nWrigley is located in Burleigh County. \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Red River Women’s Clinic, located in Fargo, North Dakota, has been in \noperation since 1998. The Clinic provides reproductive healthcare services to women, including \nabortions. The Clinic brings claims on behalf of itself and its patients. \n13.  Plaintiff Kathryn Eggleston, M.D., is a physician licensed to practice medicine in \nNorth Dakota. Dr. Eggleston is the Clinic’s medical director. She provides both medication and \nsurgical abortions to the Clinic’s patients. Dr. Eggleston brings claims on behalf of herself and her \npatients. \n14.  Defendant Drew. H. Wrigley is the State’s Attorney General. The Attorney General \nis charged with certifying to the North Dakota legislative council “the issuance of the judgment in \nany decision of the U.S. Supreme Court which, in whole or in part, restores to the states authority \nto prohibit abortion,” thereby triggering the effective date of the Abortion Ban. H.B. 1546, 66th \n  3 \n \n\nLeg. Assemb., Reg. Sess. § 2 (N.D. 2019). The Attorney General must “[a]ppear and defend all \nactions against any state officer,” and “advise the several state’s attorneys in matters relating to \nthe duties of their office.” N.D.C.C. §§ 54-12-01. He is sued in his official capacity. \n15.  Defendant Birch P. Burdick is the State Attorney for Cass County, where the Clinic \nis located. The State Attorney’s office is charged with prosecuting all public offenses on behalf of \nthe State of North Dakota. N.D.C.C. § 11-16-01(1). He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Red River Women’s Clinic \n16.  Plaintiff Red River Women’s Clinic, located in Fargo, is the only abortion clinic in \nthe State of North Dakota. \n17.  The Clinic provides abortions and offers other reproductive healthcare services, \nincluding  contraception,  pregnancy  testing,  and  sexually-transmitted  infection  testing  to  its \npatients.  \n18.  The Clinic serves patients who reside throughout North Dakota, as well as patients \nwho travel to the Clinic from neighboring states. \n19.  The Clinic performs both surgical and medication abortions approximately one day \nper week.  \n20.  The Clinic’s primary mission is to provide safe, accessible abortion care to patients. \nIf the Abortion Ban goes into effect, the Clinic will not be able to continue operating in North \nDakota. \n   \n  4 \n \n\nB.  Abortion Safety and Care \n21.  Abortion is a common medical procedure. Approximately 1 in 4 women will have \nabortions in their lifetimes.4 An estimated 18% of all pregnancies, excluding miscarriages, end in \nabortion.5 \n22.  Abortion is also one of the safest medical procedures in the United States, and major \ncomplications from abortion are rare. Research on abortion safety shows that very few abortion \npatients—approximately 0.2%—experience a complication that requires hospitalization.6 In 2018, \nthe most recent year for which abortion mortality was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control \n(“CDC”), only two deaths were related to legal abortion.7 By contrast, in 2019, the most recent \nyear for which pregnancy-related mortality was reviewed by the CDC, 754 deaths were related to \npregnancy and childbirth.8 \n23.  Carrying a pregnancy to term and childbirth carry much higher risks of both \nmorbidity and mortality than does obtaining an abortion. The mortality rate associated with \n \n4 Rachel K.

As of 2020, the most recent period for which data is available, approximately 19% \nof women in North Dakota were living in “maternal healthcare deserts,” meaning they lack reliable \naccess to prenatal care.11 This absence of essential care puts these patients at even higher risk for \nserious complications due to pregnancy, including an elevated risk of death. \n25.  Access to safe and legal abortion benefits the health and well-being of women and \ntheir families. Research shows that access to abortion has been important to facilitating women’s \nequal participation in society and in the economic and social life of the nation.12 \n26.  Patients seek abortion care for a number of reasons. The majority of patients seen \nat the Clinic already have children and do not feel that they can adequately parent and support an \nadditional child. Some patients seek abortion care because they believe that having a child will \n \n9 Increasing Access to Abortion, AM. COLL.

The Clinic also serves women seeking \nabortion care because they are experiencing domestic violence, homelessness, and/or risky or \nnonviable pregnancies, or because they are survivors of rape.   \n27.  Patients who seek and are denied access to an abortion experience worse outcomes \nthan those who are able to receive abortions. For example, a recent study found that just six months \nafter  being  denied  an  abortion,  “women  had  more  than  three  times  greater  odds  of  being \nunemployed than women who were able to access an abortion.”13  In the long term, being denied \na sought-after abortion, “resulted in an almost fourfold increase in odds that a woman’s household \nincome was below the Federal Poverty Level, and a greater likelihood of reporting not being able \nto cover basic living needs.”14 According to yet another study, compared to women who obtained \nan abortion, women who were denied an abortion experienced significant financial distress later \nin life, exhibiting a 78% increase in past-due debt and an 81% increase in public records related to \nbankruptcies, evictions, and court judgments.15 \n28.  People also seek abortions for a range of health concerns that may not be considered \n“life-threatening.” For example, some patients seek abortion care because they have an existing \nhealth condition, which may be complicated or exacerbated by a pregnancy. \n \n \n \n13 Diane G. Foster et al., Socioeconomic Outcomes of Women who Receive and Women who are \nDenied Wanted Abortions in the United States, 108 AMER. J. PUB. HEALTH 407, 412-413 (2018). \n14 Id.  \n15 Sarah Miller, Laura R. Wherry & Diana Greene Foster, The Economic Consequences of Being \nDenied an Abortion 4, (Nat’l Bureau of Econ. Rsch., Working Paper No. 26662, 2020). \n  7 \n \n\nC.  The Abortion Ban \n29.  Plaintiffs challenge the entirety of the Abortion Ban, which makes it a Class C \nfelony for a physician to perform an abortion within the state, but permits the physician to raise \naffirmative defenses for abortions performed in order to save the life of the patient or in cases of \npregnancies resulting from rape or incest. H.B. 1546 provides a contingent effective date for the \nAbortion Ban.  \n30. The Abortion Ban, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12, provides:  \n1.  As used in this section: \na.  “Abortion” means the use or prescription of any substance, device, \ninstrument, medicine, or drug to intentionally terminate the pregnancy \nof an individual known to be pregnant. The term does not include an \nact made with the intent to increase the probability of a live birth; \npreserve the life or health of a child after live birth; or remove a dead, \nunborn child who died as a result of a spontaneous miscarriage, an \naccidental trauma, or a criminal assault upon the pregnant female or \nher unborn child. \nb.  “Physician” means an individual licensed to practice medicine under \nchapter 43-17. \nc.  “Professional judgment” means a medical judgment that would be \nmade by a reasonably prudent physician who is knowledgeable about \nthe case and the treatment possibilities with respect to the medical \nconditions involved. \n2.  It is a class C felony for a person, other than the pregnant female upon \nwhom the abortion was performed, to perform an abortion. \n3.  The following are affirmative defenses under this section: \na.  That the abortion was necessary in professional judgment and was \nintended to prevent the death of the pregnant female. \nb.  That the abortion was to terminate a pregnancy that resulted from \ngross sexual imposition, sexual imposition, sexual abuse of a ward, or \nincest, as those offenses are defined in chapter 12.1-20. \nc.  That the individual was acting within the scope of that individual's \nregulated profession and under the direction of or at the direction of a \nphysician. \n  8 \n \n\n31.  Section 2 of H.B. 1546, which amended H.B. 1466, § 2, provides for the effective \ndate of the Abortion Ban:  \nThis Act becomes effective on the thirtieth day after:  \n1.  The adoption of an amendment to the United States Constitution \nwhich, in whole or in part, restores to the states the authority to \nprohibit abortion; or  \n2.  The attorney general certifies to the legislative council the issuance \nof the judgment in any decision of the United States Supreme \nCourt which, in whole or in part, restores to the states authority to \nprohibit abortion. \n32.  Nothing in the Abortion Ban, therefore, allows the Attorney General to certify to \nthe legislative council—and thus trigger the effective date of the ban—that the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas issued an opinion finding that states may prohibit abortion; rather, H.B. 1546 clearly only \nauthorizes the Attorney General to certify “the issuance of the judgment” in such a decision. \nH.B. 1546, § 2 (emphasis added). \n33.  Enforcement of the Abortion Ban falls to the State’s Attorneys, who are elected \ncounty officials representing the state in all prosecutions for public offenses. N.D.C.C. § 11-16-\n01.  \n34.  Plaintiffs are engaged in a course of conduct that is proscribed by the Abortion Ban, \nand therefore face an imminent threat of enforcement upon its effective date. But for the Abortion \nBan, Plaintiffs would continue to provide abortion services to patients in North Dakota. \nD.  The United States Supreme Court’s Recent Abortion Decision \n35.  On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392, 2022 WL 2276808 (U.S. June 24, 2022), which \noverruled Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. \nCasey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). \n  9 \n \n\n36.  Although the opinion in Dobbs has been released, the U.S. Supreme Court has not \nyet issued its judgment in that case, and it has not issued a certified copy of the judgment to the \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  \n37.  H.B. 1546 only permits the Attorney General to certify “the issuance of the \njudgment” in a case which would allow the Abortion Ban to go into effect, H.B. 1546, § 2, which, \nto date, has not occurred. Ignoring the clear legislative limitation on his role in determining the \nAbortion Ban’s effective date, on June 28, 2022, Attorney General Wrigley purported to certify to \nthe legislative council that the Abortion Ban would become effective on July 28, 2022. \nE.  Dobbs and the Effective Date of the Abortion Ban \n38.  The procedure by which the U.S. Supreme Court releases its opinions and issues its \njudgments to lower courts is defined by the Supreme Court Rules. These rules distinguish between \nthe date when an opinion is released, which is also when the judgment is entered on the docket, \nand the date when the formal judgment is issued to a lower court. \n39.  Under  the  Supreme  Court  Rules,  “[o]pinions  of  the  Court  will  be  released \nimmediately upon their announcement from the bench.” SUP. CT. R. 41. On the day that the opinion \nis released, “[t]he Clerk enters the Court’s judgment” on the docket. See Stephen M. Shapiro, et \nal., SUPREME COURT PRACTICE § 15.8 (10th ed. 2013). \n40.  However, while the judgment is entered onto the docket on that day, the formal \njudgment or mandate does not issue to the lower court on the same day that the opinion is released. \nSupreme Court Rule 45 provides that the mandate (to a state court) or certified copy of the \njudgment (to a lower federal court) does not issue to a lower court until at least 25 days later, after \nthe period of time to petition for rehearing has expired. See SUP. CT. R. 45.2 (providing that, in a \ncase on review from state court, the mandate issues “25 days after entry of the judgment”); Shapiro, \nSUPREME COURT PRACTICE § 15.8 (explaining that certified copy of the judgment in a case on \n  10 \n \n\nreview from a lower federal court issues 25 days after the entry of the judgment on the docket); \nsee also SUP. CT. R. 45.3 (discussing applicability of provisions of SUP. CT. R. 45.2 to judgment \nin a case on review from a lower federal court). The mandate or judgment will not issue sooner \nthan 25 days after entry of the judgment “unless the Court or a Justice shortens . . . the time, or \nunless the parties stipulate that it issue sooner.” SUP. CT. R. 45.2. Additionally, “[t]he filing of a \npetition for rehearing stays the mandate until disposition of the petition.” Id. \n41.  The U.S. Supreme Court’s docketing of cases likewise reflects that the Supreme \nCourt’s judgments are not issued on the same day that the opinion is released and the judgment is \nentered on the docket. For example, in Ramirez v. Collier, No. 21-5592 (U.S. 2022), a case decided \nearlier this term, the opinion was released (and the judgment entered on the docket) on March 24, \n2022. However, the case docket shows that the judgment was issued on April 25, 2022—32 days \nlater.16 Likewise, in Hughes v. Northwestern University, No. 19-1401 (U.S. 2022), the Supreme \nCourt docket shows that the judgment was entered on January 24, 2022 but not “issued” until \nFebruary 25, 2022—again, 32 days after the opinion was released.17 \n42.  Similarly here, the Supreme Court docket for Dobbs shows that the judgment has \nbeen entered but does not yet state “JUDGMENT ISSUED.”18 Because the Dobbs decision was \nreleased on June 24, 2022, under Rule 44.1, the parties have until July 19, 2022—25 days after \n \n16 See Ramirez v. Collier, 595 U.S. __, 142 S.Ct. 1264 (2022); docket for Case No. 21-5592, \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21-\n5592.html.  \n17 See Hughes v. Northwestern University, 595 U.S. _, 142 S.Ct. 737 (2022); docket for Case No. \n19-1401, https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/ \npublic/19-1401.html. \n18 See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, No. 19-1392, 2022 WL 2276808 (U.S. June 24, 2022); \ndocket for Case No. 19-1392, https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/ \ndocketfiles/html/public/19-1392.html. \n  11 \n \n\nentry of the judgment—to petition for rehearing, meaning that the Supreme Court will not issue \nits judgment until that date at the earliest. \n43.  H.B. 1546 limits the Attorney General’s role in setting the effective date for the \nAbortion Ban and only authorizes him to act when the Supreme Court has issued a judgment in a \ncase which “restores to the states authority to prohibit abortion.”  H.B. 1546, § 2. Because the \nSupreme Court has yet to issue such a judgment, the Attorney General’s premature certification is \nwithout legal effect. \nF.  Plaintiffs and Their Patients Will Be Irreparably Harmed by the Abortion Ban. \n44.  The Abortion Ban will entirely ban abortions in North Dakota, except in extremely \nnarrow circumstances. Given that abortions are the principal service that the Clinic provides, the \nAbortion Ban will force the Clinic—the only abortion provider in North Dakota—to cease \noperations in the state. The Abortion Ban and the Clinic’s closure will have a devastating impact \non the health, well-being, and economic prospects of women in North Dakota. \na.  Impact on Patient Access to Abortion \n45.  The Abortion Ban prohibits all abortions in North Dakota, except in cases where \nan abortion is intended to prevent the death of a patient or performed to terminate pregnancies \nresulting from sexual assault and/or incest.  \n46.  The Abortion Ban therefore prevents patients  from obtaining abortions when \nnecessary to avoid serious physical health risks associated with pregnancy that, while significant, \nare not as likely to be fatal. The Abortion Ban also prevents patients from obtaining abortions in \ncases where a patient has determined that an abortion is necessary for their emotional or social \nwell-being, such as to allow the patient to care for existing children or other dependents, or to \nenable them to pursue or complete their education.  \n  12 \n \n\n47.  The  Abortion  Ban’s  threat  of  criminal  liability  may  deter  physicians  from \nperforming abortions even in cases where it is necessary to save a patient’s life or where the \npregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest. Physicians will only have an affirmative defense \nunder the Statute, requiring them to affirmatively prove that they performed the abortion with the \nintention of saving the patient’s life or to terminate a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. \nThere is thus still risk of criminal liability for those physicians who perform those abortions which \nthe Statute would permit. This risk of a felony prosecution and conviction may chill physicians \nfrom providing any abortion care at all, even in cases where a patient’s life is at risk or where the \npatient is seeking to terminate a pregnancy resulting from sexual assault or incest.  \n48.  By outlawing abortion in North Dakota except in the narrowest of circumstances, \nthe Abortion Ban will necessarily force Plaintiffs to stop providing abortions in the state, leaving \npatients with no access to an abortion clinic in North Dakota. Patients seeking abortion care will \nbe forced to travel out of state to access this essential healthcare procedure.  \nb.  Impact of Restricted Abortion on Patient Health, Safety, and Well-Being \n49.  The Abortion Ban deprives patients of the ability to control decisions about their \nfamilies and their health and thereby impairs their liberty interests under the North Dakota \nConstitution. \n50.  One study predicted that if abortions were banned nationwide in the U.S., “the \nannual number of pregnancy-related deaths would increase by 21% overall.”19 This staggering \n \n19 Amanda Jean Stevenson, Study Shows An Abortion Ban May Lead to a 21% Increase in \nPregnancy-Related  Deaths,  COL.  ARTS  &  SCI.  MAG.  (Sept.  22,  2021), \nhttps://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2021/09/22/study-shows-abortion-ban-may-lead-21-\nincrease-pregnancy-related-deaths. \n  13 \n \n\nstatistic illustrates the enormous risk that the women of North Dakota will bear—risk that will \nsometimes be the difference between life and death—if the Abortion Ban goes into effect.20 \n51.  Abortion  legislation  that  relies  on  its  enforcement  by  prosecuting  healthcare \nproviders results in a lack of access to medically necessary care, obstructs the physician-patient \nrelationship, and chills providers from speaking candidly to patients about their medical options. \nFor instance, in the wake of Texas Senate Bill 8, an abortion law that provides for civil liability \nfor medical providers that provide abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, health care providers \nare  “holding  back  when  they  need  to  outline  medical  options  for  their  pregnant  patients, \nparticularly in the cases of those with high-risk pregnancies.”21 \n52.  Thus, the Abortion Ban creates significant and unjustifiable public health risks by \nforcing pregnant women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. It jeopardizes women’s health \nand safety by denying them access to a safe medical procedure that, if performed, would enable \nthem to avoid the much greater health risks associated with pregnancy and birth. \n \n20 Compare Safety of Aspiration Abortion Performed by Nurse Practitioners, Certified Nurse \nMidwives, and Physician Assistants Under a California Legal Waiver, 103(3) AM.

The Abortion Ban will also prevent women from exercising control over their \neconomic and social lives. Research shows that women denied access to abortion and forced to \ncarry pregnancies to term are four times more likely to live below the federal poverty level.22 \nAlthough men may also be economically affected by having a new child, parenthood widens the \npay gap between men and women, significantly decreasing women’s average lifetime earnings.23 \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim for Relief  \n(Right to Terminate a Pregnancy) \n54.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 53 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n55.

The Abortion Ban reflects an animus towards abortion, physicians who perform \nabortions, and women who obtain abortions. Its sole purpose is to eliminate access to abortion in \nNorth Dakota. \n58.  By denying access to abortion care, the Abortion Ban deprives patients of the ability \nto control their reproductive decisions, impairs their liberty interests, and threatens their safety. It \nrestricts patients’ healthcare decisions by preventing them from being able to access abortion care \nand forcing them to remain pregnant against their will. It therefore creates a significant and \nunjustifiable public health crisis by forcing pregnant people to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, \nand it prevents Plaintiffs’ patients from exercising control over their economic and social lives. \n59.  The Abortion Ban also deprives Plaintiffs’ patients of their personal autonomy and \nself-determination, as well as interfering with Plaintiffs’ ability to make decisions about their \nfamilial relationships. \n60.  Further, the Abortion Ban relies on the targeting and prosecution of healthcare \nproviders for its enforcement. This mechanism operates as a total ban because it puts providers at \nrisk of a felony conviction, chilling physicians from providing care even in situations where the \nabortion may be medically necessary to save the patient’s life or forcing them to allow a patient’s \nsituation to worsen until they are at death’s door. The Abortion Ban will thus cause unneeded and \npreventable death and serious injury. \n61.  The Abortion Ban therefore directly infringes on Plaintiffs’ patients’ rights to life, \nsafety, and happiness, which Article I guarantees to all people, by threatening their lives, economic \nsecurity, and mental health. \n  16 \n \n\nSecond Claim for Relief \n(Declaratory Judgment) \n62.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 61 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n63.  The North Dakota Declaratory Judgment Act, N.D.C.C. § 32-23-01 et seq., allows \n“[a]ny person” who is “affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise, [to] have \ndetermined  any  question  of  construction  or  validity  arising  under  the  instrument,  statute, \nordinance, contract, or franchise and may obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal \nrelations thereunder.” N.D.C.C. § 32-23-02. “The provisions authorizing declaratory relief are \nremedial and are to be construed and administered liberally to afford relief from uncertainty about \nrights, status, and other legal relations.” City of Harwood v. City of Reiles Acres, 2015 ND 33, ¶ \n11, 859 N.W.2d 13 (citing N.D.C.C. § 32-23-12).  \n64.  Under H.B. 1546, the Attorney General lacks authority to certify to the legislative \ncouncil that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health \nOrganization, Case No. 19-1392, has “restore[d] to the states authority to prohibit abortion,” as \nrequired to trigger the effective date of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-12, because the Supreme Court has not \nissued its judgment in Dobbs.  \n65.  Plaintiffs  seek  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  Attorney  General’s  purported \ncertification is without legal force or effect. Because the condition precedent to the effective date \nof the Abortion Ban has not been met, the Attorney General does not have the legal authority to \ncertify the effective date of the Statute, and the Abortion Ban remains unenforceable. \n  17 \n \n\n66.  Plaintiffs further affirmatively plead and allege that they have sued Defendants in \ntheir official capacities, state officials are necessary parties to this suit, and governmental immunity \ndoes not apply. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n67. Issue a declaratory judgment that the contingent effective date of the Abortion Ban cannot \nbe triggered until the United States Supreme Court issues a judgment in Dobbs v. Jackson \nWomen’s Health Organization, Case No. 19-1392; \n68. Issue a declaratory judgment that the Abortion Ban violates the Constitution of the State \nof North Dakota and is void and of no effect;  \n69. Issue permanent injunctive relief, without bond, restraining Defendants, their employees, \nagents, and successors in office from triggering the effective date of the Abortion Ban until \nthe Supreme Court has issued its judgment in Dobbs;  \n70. Issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, later to be made permanent, \nrestraining Defendants, their employees, agents, successors, and anyone acting in concert \nwith them from enforcing the Abortion Ban; and \n71.

Eggleston,  M.D.,  (““RRWC”  or  “Plaintiffs”),  filed  a  motion  for  a  temporary \ninjunction  in  the  above  matter  to  stop  the  enforcement  of North  Dakota  Century  Code  §  12.1-31- \n12,  currently  set to  take  effect  on  July  28,  2022.

RRWC  filed  a  reply  brief countering  Wrigley’s  arguments  on  July  22,  2022.  Docket  No. \n65. \nBACKGROUND \n({2]  The  issue currently before the  Court  is whether a temporary  restraining order is appropriate \nto  halt  N.D.C.C.  §  12.1-31-12  from  taking  effect  on  July  28,  2022.  North  Dakota  Century  Code  § \n12.1-31-12  defines  the  crime  and  affirmative  defenses  of abortion.  This  statute  was  enacted  by  the\nLegislature  in  2007,  while  Roe  v.  Wade,  410  U.S.  113  (1973)  and  Planned  Parenthood  of \nSoutheastern  Pennsylvania  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833  (1992),  were  still  in  effect.  Because  §  12.1-31- \n12  would  have  been  unconstitutional  under  these  cases  at  the  time  it  was  enacted,  the  Legislature \nplaced a triggering provision into  the statute to allow it to take affect should the conditions outlined \nbe  met.  The  triggering  language  included  with the  statute  in 2007  was “This  Act  becomes effective \non the  date  the  legislative  council  approves  by  motion  the  recommendation  of the  attorney  general \nto  the  legislative  council  that  it  is  reasonably  probable  that  this  Act  would  be  upheld  as \nconstitutional.”  However,  in  2019,  the  Legislature  amended  the  trigger  language  to: \n[T]his  Act  become  effective  on  the  thirtieth  day  after: \n1.  The  adoption  of  an  amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution \nwhich,  in  whole  or  in  part,  restores  to  the  states  the  authority  to \nprohibit  abortion;  or \n2.  The  attorney  general  certifies  to  the  legislative  council  the  issuance \nof the judgment  in  any  decision  of the  United  States  Supreme  Court \nwhich,  in  whole  or  in part,  restores  to  the  states  authority  to  prohibit \nabortion{.] \n[{3]  All  parties  agree  the  current  issue  is  whether  the  second  provision  of the  trigger  language \nof  §  12.1-31-12  was  properly  initiated  and  implemented  in  this  case.  The  following  facts  are \nundisputed  between  the  parties.  First,  in  Dobbs  v.  Jackson  Women’s  Health  Organization,  the \nUnited  States  Supreme  Court  overruled  Roe  and  Planned  Parenthood  of  Southeastern \nPennsylvania,  restoring to  the  states authority  to  prohibit  abortion.  142  S.Ct.  2228  (2022).  Second, \nthe  United  States  Supreme  Court  issued  its  opinion  in  Dobbs  on  June  24,  2022,  and  on  July  26, \n2022,  issued  its  Judgment.  And,  lastly,  Wrigley,  acting in  his  role  as  the  attorney  general,  certified \nto  the North  Dakota  legislative  council  that  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  issued  a judgment  in \na decision that  restored  to  the  states  the  authority  to  prohibit  abortion on  June  28,  2022.\nANALYSIS \n[14]  North  Dakota  Rules  of Civil  Procedure  Rule  65(a)  allows  the  Court  the  ability  to  grant  a \ntemporary  restraining  order  until  it  makes  a  final  decision  on  the  appropriateness  of  issuing  a \npreliminary  injunction  in  the  matter.  The  purpose  of the  temporary  restraining  order  is  to  prevent \nirreparable  injury.  /d.  At  this  time,  RRWC  has  filed  a  motion  for  injunctive  relief and  Wrigley  has \nanswered.  However,  no  hearing  has  been  held  on  the  issue  and  Court  has  only  had  all  of the  briefs \nbefore it  for  less  than  one  week.  At  this  time,  the  Court  is  not able  to  make  its  final  decision  on  the \nappropriateness  of issuing  a preliminary  injunction  before  §  12.1-31-12  is  set  to  take  effect  on  July \n28,  2022.  Therefore,  the  Court  will  consider  whether  a  temporary  restraining  order  is  instead \nappropriate  until  it  can  rule  on  the  motion  for preliminary  injunction. \n[15]  RRWC  argues  a  temporary  restraining  order  is  appropriate  because  Wrigley  failed  to \nproperly  follow  the  procedure  outlined  in  the  trigger  language  of  §  12.1-31-12;  specifically, \nRRWC  argues  Wrigley  prematurely  issued  its  certification  to  the  Legislature  because  the  United \nStates  Supreme Court had  yet to  issue  its certified judgment  of Dobbs.  Conversely,  Wrigley  argues \na  temporary  restraining  order  is  inappropriate  because  he  followed  the  procedure  of  the  trigger \nlanguage,  and  even  if he  did  not,  the  Court  cannot  retroactively  restrain  him  from  issuing  such  a \ncertification. \n([{6]  As  outlined  above,  the  triggering  language  of§   12.1-31-12  states:  “The  attorney  general \ncertifies  to  the  legislative  council  the  issuance  of  the  judgment  in  any  decision  of  the  United \nStates  Supreme  Court  which,  in  whole  or  in  part,  restores  to  the  states  authority  to  prohibit \nabortion.”  (emphasis  added).  The  meaning,  and  therefore,  the  timing  of  the  “issuance  of  the \njudgment”  language,  is  the  only  dispute  between  the  parties  in  regard  to  the  triggering  language. \nWWRC  argues  the  judgment  of the  Supreme  Court  isn’t  issued  until  25  days  after  the  Supreme\nCourt  publishes  its  opinion  when  the  mandate  is  issued,  which  includes  a  certified  copy  of  the \nSupreme  Court’s  Judgment.  See  Sup.  Ct.  R.  45.  Wrigley  argues  the judgment  is  issued  on  the  date \nthe  opinion  is  signed. \n{{7]  The  Court  is  not  persuaded  by  Wrigley’s  argument  and  instead  agrees  with  the  logic  of the \nWWRC.  After the Supreme Court publishes its  opinion  on a  case,  the parties have 25  days  in which \nto  seek a petition for rehearing on the matter.  See  Sup.  Ct.  R.  44.  Although exceedingly  rare, during \nthe  time  for  a  petition  for  rehearing,  the  Supreme  Court  could  alter  or  amended  its  original \njudgment  and  decisions,  thereby  rendering  the  original  opinion  moot.  Without  the  formal \ncertification  of the  Supreme  Court’s  opinion,  the  lower courts  cannot  be  guaranteed  of the  finality \nof the  Supreme  Court’s  decision.  Therefore,  this  Court  finds  the  language  contained  to  trigger  § \n12.1-31-12  requires  the  formal  issuance  of the  Supreme  Court’s judgment through the certification \nand mandate. \n[78]  Additionally,  this  Court  finds  the  Legislature’s  altering  of the  triggering  language  between \nthe  original  language  implemented  in  2007  and  the  language  currently  in  place,  persuasive.  Under \nthe  original  language,  all  that  was  required  was  for  the  attorney  general  to  recommend  to  the \nlegislative  council  that  §  12.1-31-12  would  be  upheld  as  constitutional.  However,  in  2019,  the \nLegislature  saw  fit  to  amend  the  language  and  implement  a  more  restrictive  process  to  trigger  the \nstatute.  Wrigley’s  certification  prior  to  the  Supreme  Court’s  certified  judgment  would  have  been \nproper under the triggering  language  in 2007,  but  the  Court  is  not persuaded that  such action meets \nthe  heightened  procedural  requirements  adopted  in  2019. \n({9]  The  Court  finds  in  certifying  the  Legislative  Counsel  on  June  28,  2022,  Wrigley \nprematurely  attempted  to  execute  the  triggering  language  of §  12.1-31-12.  Such  certification  was\nimproper  until  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  issued  its  certified  judgment  on  July  26,  2022. \nTherefore  the  Court  finds  a  temporary  restraining  order  appropriate  at  this  time. \nORDER \n{{10]  The  Court  hereby  GRANTS  WWRC’s  motion  for  a  temporary  restraining  order, \nprohibiting  North  Dakota  Century  Code  §  12.1-31-12  from  taking  effect  until  attorney  general \nfollows  the  provisions  outline  in  the  triggering  language  or  until  future  order  of the  Court. \nDated  this  27th  day  of July,  2022. \nBY  TH \n Bruce  Romanick,  Presi ding  Judge \nSouth  Central  Judicial  District.\n\n############# Old Text on 20240828 ###############\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Burdick,  in  his  e\nofficial  capacity  as  the  State  Attorney \ne\nfor  Cass  County, \nN\nDefendants. \n  \n({1]  The  Plaintiffs,  Access  Independent  Health  Services,  Inc.,  d/b/a  Red  River  Women’s  Clinic \nand  Kathryn  L.  Eggleston,  M.D.,  (““RRWC”  or  “Plaintiffs”),  filed  a  motion  for  a  temporary \nrestraining  order  and  preliminary  injunction  in  the  above  matter  to  stop  the  enforcement  of North \nDakota  Century  Code  §  12.1-31-12,  currently  set  to  take  effect  on  July  28,  2022.  Docket  No.  5. \nThe  Defendants,  Drew  Wrigley  and  Birch  Burdick,  (“Wrigley”  or  “the  State”),  filed  a  response \nopposing  RRWC’s  motion.  Docket  No.  63.  RRWC  filed  a  reply  brief  countering  Wrigley’s \narguments  on  July  22,  2022.  Docket No.  65.  On  July  27,  2022,  the  Court  granted  RRWC’s  motion \nfor  a  temporary  restraining  order.  A  motion  hearing  for  the  preliminary  junction  was  held  on \nAugust  19,  2022. \nBACKGROUND \n[{2]  RRWC  filed  the  above  suit to prevent  Wrigley  from enforcing North  Dakota Century Code \n§  12.1-31-12,  (“the  statute”),  The  statute  defines  the  crime,  and  affirmative  defenses,  of abortion. \n1\nThis  statute  was  enacted  by  the  Legislature  in  2007,  while  Roe  v.  Wade,  410  U.S.  113  (1973)  and \nPlanned  Parenthood  of Southeastern  Pennsylvania  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833  (1992),  were  still  in \neffect.  Because  §  12.1-31-12  would have  been unconstitutional  under these  cases  at the time  it was \nenacted,  the  Legislature  placed  a  triggering  provision  into  the  statute  to  allow  it  to  take  affect \nshould  the  conditions  outlined  be  met.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  in  Dobbs  v.  Jackson \nWomen's  Health  Organization,  overruled  Roe  and  Casey,  and  restored  to  the  states  authority  to \nprohibit  abortion.  142  S.Ct.  2228  (2022). \n[13]  | Previously,  the  Court  addressed  whether  a  temporary  restraining  order  was  appropriate  in \nthe  above  case.  Under  the  circumstances  as  they  existed  at  the  time,  the  Court  granted  RRWC’s \nrequest  for a  temporary  restraining  order,  halting  the  enforcement  of the  statute.  The  current  issue \nbefore  the  Court  is  whether  to  extend  the  temporary  restraining  order  into  a  formal  preliminary \nInjunction. \nLEGAL  ANALYSIS \n{§4]  North  Dakota  Century  Code  section  32-06-02  outlines  the  situations  where  the  Court  can \nissue  an  injunction,  including:  “When,  during  the  litigation,  it  shall  appear  that  the  defendant  is \ndoing or threatening,  or  is  about to  do,  or  is  procuring  or  suffering,  some  act  to  be  done  in violation \nof  the  plaintiff's  rights  respecting  the  subject  of  the  action  and  tending  to  render  the  judgment \nineffectual[.]”  Before  deciding  whether  to  grant  a  preliminary  injunction,  a  trial  court  must \nconsider  four  factors:  “(1)  substantial  probability  of  succeeding  on  the  merits;  (2)  irreparable \ninjury;  (3)  harm  to  other  interested  parties;  and  (4)  effect  on  the  public  interest.”  Nodak Mut.  Ins. \nCo.  v.  Ward County  Farm  Bureau,  2004  ND  60,  §  24,  676  N.W.2d  752. \n[{5]  | The  party  seeking  the  preliminary  injunction  has  the  burden  of establishing  the  necessity \nof the  injunction.  Vorachek  v.  Citizens  State  Bank  of Lankin,  461  N.W.2d  580,  385  (N.D.  1990).\n“The  most  important  prerequisite  for  the  issuance  of a  preliminary  injunction  is  a  demonstration \nthat,  if the  preliminary  injunction  is  not  granted,  the  applicant  is  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm \nbefore  a  decision  on  the  merits  can  be  rendered.”  Jd.  Additionally,  “the  purpose  of a  temporary  or \npreliminary  injunction  ‘is  to  maintain  the  cause  in  status  quo  until  a  trial  on  the  merits.’” a  State  v. \nHolecek,  545  N.W.2d  800,  804  (N.D.  1996)  (quoting  Gunsch  y,  Gunsch,  69  N.W.2d  739,  7456 \n(N.D.  1954)).  The  ultimate  “decision  to  grant  or  deny  a  preliminary  injunction  is  within  the \ndiscretion  of the  trial  court[.]”  Fargo  Women’s  Health  Organization,  Inc.  v.  Lambs  of Christ,  488 \nN.W.2d  401,  406  (N.D.  1992). \n[{6]  |  In  assessing  whether  to  grant  RRWC’s  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction,  the  Court  will \nconsider  each  of  the  four  factors,  outlined  in  Nodak  Mut.  Ins.  Co.,  individually  and  then  weigh \nthem  collectively.  The  Court  will  note,  that  at  the  hearing  held  on  August  19,  2022,  to  address \nwhether the  Court  should  grant  RRWC’s  motion  for preliminary injunction,  neither party provided \nany  evidence  to  the  Court;  rather,  all  parties  relied  solely  on  arguments.  Because  the  Court did  not \nreceive  any  evidence  at the hearing, the Court is  left with the two  declarations,  (“the declarations”), \nfiled  by  RRWC  in  support  of its  motion  in  which  to  base  any  of its  factual  findings.  Docket  Nos. \n7,  8.  The  declarations  were  submitted  by  Tammi  Kromenaker,  the  Director  of  the  Red  River \nWomen’s  Clinic,  and  Dr.  Mark  Nichols.  /d.  The  Court  would  also  note  that  in  addition  to  not \nsubmitting  any  affidavits  or  providing  any  evidence,  the  State  failed  to  counter  or  object  to  any \nfactual  statements  made  by  RRWC  through  its  declarations. \n1.  Substantial  Probability  of Succeeding  on  the  Merits \n({7]  The  central  question  in  the  above  case  is  one  of  a  purely  legal  matter,  that  is,  the \nconstitutionality  of  §  12.1-31-12.  Although  both  parties  spend  substantial  time  arguing  the  first\nprong,  the  underlying  issue  before  the  Court  has  no  questions  of  facts;  the  determination  of  the \nsubstantial  probability  of succeeding  on  the  merits  would  essentially have  the  Court  determine  the \nfinal  validity  of the  parties’  claims.  As  such,  the  Court  makes  no  findings  towards  the  substantial \nprobability  of  succeeding  on  the  merits  prong  and  instead,  reserves  such  analysis  for  the  proper \ntime,  on  a  motion  for  summary judgment  or trial. \n2.  Irreparable  Injury \n[8]  RRWC  argues  in  support  of a  preliminary  injunction  that  if  §  12.1-31-12  takes  effect,  the \nClinic  will  have  to  close,  women  will  be  denied  access  to  abortions  in  North  Dakota,  patients  will \nsuffer  because  they  may  face  irreversible  and  potentially  devastating  health  consequences,  and \npatients  may  suffer  economic  consequences.  In  support  of  its  arguments,  RRWC  cites  to  Dr. \nNichols  Declaration. \n[79]  RRWC  also  argues: \nThe  availability  of  abortion  care  in  neighboring  states  does  not  relieve  North \nDakota  of its  obligations  to  safeguard  its  citizens’  constitutional  rights.  Indeed,  in \nother  cases  involving  abortion  restrictions,  courts  have  held  that  “the  proper \nformulation  of the  undue  burden  analysis  focuses  solely  on  the  effects  within  the \nregulating state”  because  “a  state  cannot  lean  on  its  sovereign  neighbors  to  provide \nprotection  of  its  citizens’  federal  constitutional  rights.”  Jackson  Women’s  Health \nOrg.  v.  Currier,  760  F.3d  448,  457  (5th  Cire.  2014)  (emphasis  added). \n[§10]  However,  the  Court  is  not  persuaded  by  this  argument.  At  this  time,  this  Court,  nor  the \nNorth  Dakota  Supreme  Court,  has  not  declared  a  right  to  abortion  under  the  North  Dakota \nConstitution.  Additionally,  as  outlined by  RRWC’s  own quoting of Jackson  Women’s Health  Org., \nstates  cannot  rely  on  other  states  to  protect federal  constitutional  rights.  After  Dobbs,  and  the \noverturning  of Roe  and  Casey,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  made  it  clear  that  United  States \nConstitution  does  not  include  a  right  to  an  abortion.\n[{11]  The  State  argues  it  will  suffer  irreparable  injury  if the  Court  grants  RRWC’s  motion  for  a \npreliminary  injunction  because  when  the  State  is  prohibited  from  enacting  statutes  enacted  by  the \npeople,  irreparable  injury  occurs.  The  State  also  argues  that  it  has  a  legitimate  interest  in  human \nlife  at  all  stages  of development,  and  that  if the  statute  is  not  enacted,  it  will  result  in  irreversible \nloss  of unborn  children. \n[12]  As  stated  above,  the  State  provided  no  evidence  to  the  Court,  through  testimony  or  sworn \nstatements,  of any  impact  a  preliminary  injunction  would  have  on  the  State  or  its  citizens.  At  this \ntime,  all  that  is  before  the  Court  is  conclusory  statements  by  the  State  and  RRWC’s  two \ndeclarations.  Dr.  Nichols’s  declaration  outlines  the  various  risks  which  can  occur  during \npregnancies,  specifically,  high  risk  pregnancies.  He  lays  out  the  heightened  chances  of \ncomplications  and  necessary  medical  intervention  when  a  pregnancy  progresses  rather  than \nterminated  through  an  abortion.  Additionally,  although  the  Court  recognizes  that  the  State,  and  its \ncitizens,  have  an  interest  in  having  statutes  and  legislature  enacted,  the  Court  would  be  remiss  if it \ndid  not  acknowledge  the  fact  that  the  statute  was  enacted  in  2007.  The  citizens  have  waited  15 \nyears  to  have  the  statute  enacted,  in  light  of  this  length  of  time,  any  additional  delay  in  the \nenactment  of  the  statute  would  be  minimal.  Therefore,  any  interest  the  State  may  have  in \neffectuating  the  statute,  at  this  time,  is  less  than  the  injuries  caused  to  RRWC. \n3.  Harm  to  Other  Interested Parties \n[713]  RRWC  argues  that  the  harm  of the  statue  taking  effect  would  be  significant,  reiterating  its \narguments  above,  and  that  the  defendants  would  not  be  injured  because  a  preliminary  injunction \nmerely  preserves  the  status  quo.  For  the  third  and  fourth  factor,  Wrigley  combines  his  arguments \ninto  one.  He  argues  that  the  people  of North  Dakota  have  made  it  clear,  through  the  legislative\nprocess,  that  they  support  and  believe  that  the  provisions  in  §  12.1-31-12  are  appropriate. \n[qi4]  The  Court  finds  RRWC’s  arguments  more  persuasive.  Once  again,  the  State  fails  to \nprovide any evidence of any harm  to  other interested parties.  Rather,  the State rests on  the argument \nthat  the  harm  comes  from  simply not  allowing  the  statute  to  be  enacted.  However,  as  stated  above, \nthe  statute  has  been  lying  dormant  for  approximately  15  years  before  it  was  allowed  to  take  affect \nwith the repeal of Roe  and  Casey.  The  State has offered no evidence  on how delaying the  enactment \nof the  statute  during  the  pendency of this  litigation  implicates  any additional  harm than has  already \nbeen  in  place  for  the  last  15  years.  Whereas,  RRWC  outlines  real  and  tangible  harm  to  others  if \nthe  statute  goes  into  effect  during  this  litigation. \n4.  Effect  on  the  Public  Interest \n{{15]  In  arguing  that  the  public  has  an  interest  in  granting  the  preliminary  injunction  RRWC \nstates  that  the  public  always  has  an  interest  in  protecting  constitutional  rights.  Although  the  Court \nagree  with  the  public  having  an  interest  in  protecting  the  constitutional  rights  of citizens,  at  this \ntime,  the  determination  of whether  the  North  Dakota  Constitution  includes a  right  to  abortion  has \nyet  to  be  made.  RRWC  also  argues  that  without  a  preliminary  injunction,  patients  who  are  denied \nthe  ability  to  have  an  abortion  will  cause  poverty  and  financial  distress  to  patients  and  the  public \nhas  an  interest  in preventing this.  Lastly,  RRWC  argues  that the  statute  will  undermine  the public’s \ntrust  in  law  enforcement;  that  is,  law  enforcement  will  be  called  to  deprive  the  citizens  of North \nDakota  a  fundamental  right  before  the  courts  decide  the  constitutionality  of the  statute. \n[{16]  As  stated  above,  Wrigley  combined  his  arguments  for  the  last  two  prongs  and  stands  on \nthe  argument that the  people  have  made  it clear  of their  intent to  prohibit  abortion,  except  ina very \nlimited  number  of circumstances,  throughout  the  history  of North  Dakota. \n6\n({17]  Essentially,  for  this  last  prong,  both  parties  argue  the  longstanding  tradition  of  either \npermitting  or  penalizing  abortions  in  North  Dakota.  RRWC  argues  that  there  has  been  a \nlongstanding  tradition  of  allowing  abortions  because  for  the  last  50  years,  Roe  and  Casey  have \ncontrolled  and  allowed  for  women’s  rights  to  choose  whether to  seek  abortions.  Whereas  Wrigley \nargues  that  the  longstanding  tradition  should  not  be  limited  to  the  last  50  years,  but  rather,  should \nbe  analyzed  from  the  perspective  of  North  Dakota  from  its  statehood.  The  Court  can  see  the \nvalidity  of  both  parties’  arguments.  However,  as  stated  above,  the  purpose  of  preliminary \ninjunctions  is  to  maintain  the  status  quo  during  the  pendency  of the  litigation  and  prevent  harm. \nAt  this  time,  the  status  quo  in  North  Dakota  is  not  to  restrict  or  limit  abortions  as  outlined  in  § \n12.1-31-12. \n[418]  Lastly,  although  not  necessarily  a  part  of  any  of  the  four  factors  under  the  Court's \nconsideration,  the  Court  will  address  the  fact  that  RRWC  has  relocated  into  Minnesota.  RRWC \nwas  the  only  abortion  clinic  operating  in the  state  of North  Dakota.  Although  the  enactment of the \nstatute  would  have  impacted  RRWC  and  its  operation  greatly,  RRWC  is  not  the  only  entity  or \nindividual  which  would  be  affected.  The  statute  would  implicate  others,  including  physicians  at \nregional  hospitals  if it  were  to  go  into  effect.  Therefore,  even  without  RRWC’s  operation  in North \nDakota,  the  Court’s  determination  of a  preliminary  injunction  is  still  pertinent  and  appropriate. \nCONCLUSION \n[119]  For  the  foregoing  reasons: \n[§20]  RRWC’s  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  is  GRANTED.  The  enactment  and \nenforcement  of N.D.C.C.  §  12.1-31-12  shall  be  suspended  until  final  disposition  of the  above  case \nor  further  order  of the  Court.\nDated  this ZS | day  of August,  2022. \nBY  THE  COURT: \n@xe—_S \n \nBruce  Romanick,  Presiding  Judge \nSouth  Central  Judicial  District \n\n############# Old Text on 20240828 ###############\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
