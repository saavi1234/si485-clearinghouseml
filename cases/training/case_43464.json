New deadlines for Defendant to serve its papers in opposition to the motion for class certification and any supporting expert reports, and for Plaintiffs to serve their reply papers in further support of the motion for class certification and any supporting expert reports, will be set at the same time that the schedule for Defendant's post-class certification motion discovery is finalized. A telephonic status conference is scheduled for Wednesday, March 30, 2022 at 2:00 p.m. (EDT) before Magistrate Judge Krause so that the Court can (1) resolve the expert discovery issue raised in ECF Nos. 205 and 206; (2) engage with the parties in a preliminary discussion regarding post-class certification motion discovery; and (3) schedule a conference for completion of discussions regarding post-class certification motion discovery.

Plaintiffs' letter motion for an extension is GRANTED, and the schedule proposed by Plaintiffs will be so-ordered and docketed separately. This long-running case has involved substantial document productions from both sides -- Defendant's document productions continued through last month, and additional data productions are forthcoming in March. While Defendant's interest in concluding discovery is understandable, the additional time requested by Plaintiffs here is more than reasonable in light of the complexity of the case, the prior discovery extensions, and the number of tasks remaining to be completed. Ultimately, there is a modest difference in the parties' positions on the appropriate length of the extension, and Plaintiffs clearly have heeded the Court's directions by reducing the original six-month extension request to a 4.5 month request. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' proposed schedule will be adopted. The parties should not expect to receive any further discovery extensions. (HEREBY ORDERED by Magistrate Judge Andrew E.

The Court granted the requests to seal made in Doc. Nos. 274, 276, and 278. The redacted documents filed on the public docket will remain the publicly-filed versions of Plaintiffs' pre-motion letter, Plaintiffs' opposition to Defendant's pre-motion letter, and Rule 56.1 Statement, respectively. The unredacted versions of those documents will remain under seal. The Court heard argument from the parties concerning their requests to move for summary judgment. In light of the discussion on the record, the parties shall file by September 2, 2022 a letter advising the Court whether they still intend to move for summary judgment. In the event any motions for summary judgment are made, the moving papers shall be served by October 3, 2022; opposition thereto shall be served by November 3, 2022; reply shall be served by November 15, 2022; and all motion papers shall be filed on the reply date, November 15, 2022. The Court set the matter down for a non-jury trial to begin on January 17, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. The case must therefore be trial ready for that date. All parties and counsel shall appear on that date and time in Courtroom 520 of the courthouse located at 300 Quarropas Street, White Plains, New York 10601. The Court directed the parties to meet and confer and file, in strict accordance with the Court's Individual Practices, the joint pretrial order required under Rule 6(A) by October 3, 2022. By November 3, 2022, the parties shall file Rule 6(B) and 6(C) proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law as a single document: Plaintiffs shall prepare the proposed document addressing their claims for relief at issue, serve same on Defendant, and Defendant shall state any opposition thereto by placing the opposing finding of fact or conclusion of law immediately below the fact or conclusion to which there is objection, supported by applicable citation; and Defendant shall set forth any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law addressing their defenses at issue at the end of that document, serve same on Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs shall state any opposition thereto by placing the opposing finding of fact or conclusion of law immediately below the fact or conclusion to which there is objection, supported by applicable citation. By November 15, 2022, the parties shall submit to the Court in accordance with Rule 6(D) the affidavits constituting the direct testimony of each trial witness except for expert witnesses, as well as the other materials contemplated by the rule. Direct testimony of experts will be live and not by affidavit. By September 12, 2022, Defendant shall write a one-page letter to the Court advising whether they consent to the entry of an order referring the parties to settlement conferences with Magistrate Judge Krause. See Transcript.The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to terminate the letter-motions pending at Doc. Nos. 273, 274, 275, 276, and 278. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Philip M. Halpern on 8/29/2022) (tg) (Entered: 08/29/2022)"

Based upon the foregoing, Defendant's objections to the Report are overruled, and the Court adopts the Report in its entirety, except with the modifications noted below to the recommended class definitions. The Court certifies the following three classes: o All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft, aside from Lyfts Access Regions or NYC, who require WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft's transportation services (the Non-Access Region Class) (represented by Lowell and WDOMI and asserting claims under the ADA) o All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft in New York State aside from NYC who require WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyfts transportation services (the New York State Other Than NYC Class) (represented by Lowell asserting claims under the ADA and NYSHRL and WDOMI asserting claims under the ADA); and o All residents of or visitors to Westchester County who require WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft's transportation services (the Westchester Class) represented by Lowell asserting claims under the ADA and NYSHRL and WDOMI asserting claims under the ADA). Excluded from the classes are people who (1) have downloaded the Lyft app; (2) have brought separate litigation against Lyft for its failure to serve people with disabilities; and/or (3) are residents of Ohio State University or the University of Texas at Austin who do not leave those campuses. The Court appoints Finkelstein, Blankinship, Frei-Pearson & Garber, LLP, Morgan & Morgan, P.C., and Michael Hellman of ADA compliance specialists as class counsel. A status conference has been scheduled for April 5, 2023 at 12:30 p.m. to be held by telephone to discuss the filing of revised pretrial submissions. At the time of the scheduled conference, all parties shall call the following number: (888) 398-2342; access code 3456831. For the sake of clarity on the electronic docket, the Court grants the request to maintain under seal the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that were filed on December 7, 2022.

    "summary": "<p>On August 17, 2017, an individual from White Plains, New York who uses a motorized scooter to travel filed this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Represented by private counsel and the Westchester Independent Living Center, the plaintiff sued Lyft, Inc., alleging a failure to provide accessible service to people with mobility disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 12181), the New York State Human Rights Law (N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 290) (&ldquo;NYSHRL&rdquo;), and the New York City Human Rights Law (N.Y.C. Admin. Code &sect; 8-101) (&ldquo;NYCHRL&rdquo;). The case was assigned to District Judge Nelson Stephen Rom&aacute;n.</p>\r\n<p>Under Title III of the ADA, a private entity primarily engaged in the business of transporting people may not discriminate from use of its services on the basis of disability. Additionally, under section 12184(b)(2)(A), covered entities must provide reasonable modifications to their services that would enable persons with disabilities to enjoy those services. In her initial complaint, the plaintiff alleged that Lyft was a public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA, that Lyft provided worse service to individuals with mobility disabilities than to individuals without disabilities, and that Lyft failed to make reasonable modifications that would have made the service equally reliable for the disabled and non-disabled alike. The plaintiffs also alleged that Lyft violated the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL under similar theories, along with a claim that Lyft&rsquo;s policies resulted in a detrimental disparate impact on people with mobility disabilities in violation of a separate provision of the NYCHRL.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff sought certification to represent a nationwide class of similarly situated persons protected by the ADA&mdash;including all residents and visitors of all cities and regions serviced by Lyft&mdash;as well as two subclasses of similarly situated individuals protected by the NYSHRL and NYCHRL respectively. The plaintiff sought declaratory relief defining Lyft as a public accommodation within the definitions of the above statutes and that Lyft&rsquo;s policies violate said statutes. She also sought injunctive relief to force Lyft to remediate their service into compliance with the ADA and New York statutes, as well as compensatory damages and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>On December 6, 2017 the individual plaintiff amended her complaint to add the non-profit organization Westchester Disabled on the Move, Inc. (WDOMI) as a plaintiff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lyft filed a motion to dismiss on January 24, 2018 (docketed on March 30, 2018) on the basis of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Lyft argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the claim because they had not signed up for a Lyft account, and that Lyft&rsquo;s terms of service included an arbitration agreement and a class action waiver, which, Lyft argued, should prevent the plaintiffs from recovering under the principles of direct benefits estoppel. Lyft also argued that the plaintiffs failed to allege a concrete and particularized injury and actual or imminent harm. Lyft also took issue with WDOMI&rsquo;s associational and organizational standing. Furthermore, Lyft further argued that, if the court retained jurisdiction, the plaintiffs failed to state a claim because Lyft was a technology company rather than in the transportation business and the remedy sought&mdash;that Lyft be required to purchase or lease wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs)&mdash;was not required under the ADA or New York statutes. Finally, Lyft argued the class claims should be dismissed because membership in the classes was dependent on a &ldquo;purely subjective criterion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2018, the plaintiffs filed their response to the motion to dismiss, arguing that individuals were not required to engage in &ldquo;futile gestures&rdquo; to allege concrete injury under the ADA. The plaintiffs also submitted declarations from individuals with disabilities who were associated with the lawsuit indicating their desire to use Lyft&rsquo;s services and their perceptions of the shortcomings of Lyft&rsquo;s services that prevented them from signing up.</p>\r\n<p>On April 5, 2018, the National Council on Independent Living requested the court&rsquo;s leave to file an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs, which Judge Rom&aacute;n granted on April 17. &nbsp;The brief largely bolstered the plaintiffs&rsquo; argument that downloading the Lyft app would be a futile gesture and therefore not required to obtain standing under the ADA. The brief also argued that Lyft is in fact a transportation company under the definition of the ADA.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Rom&aacute;n entered his opinion and order concerning Lyft&rsquo;s motion to dismiss on November 29, 2018, granting in part and denying in part. He denied the motion with respect to the individual plaintiff, agreeing that the ADA does not require parties to engage in futile gestures where they know they can&rsquo;t use a service because of their disability. The individual plaintiff&rsquo;s allegation that she had notice that Lyft&rsquo;s service had accessibility issues was sufficient to survive the motion to dismiss. Judge Rom&aacute;n further agreed that the individual&rsquo;s injury was fairly traceable to Lyft and that the court would be able to redress the injury. <em>Lowell v. Lyft, Inc.</em>, 352 F. Supp. 3d 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)</p>\r\n<p>Judge Rom&aacute;n granted Lyft&rsquo;s motion to dismiss the NYCHRL and NYSHRL claims for lack of standing with respect to plaintiff WDOMI, agreeing with Lyft that WDOMI did not have associational standing because the amended complaint requested compensatory damages, which would require the participation of the organization&rsquo;s members. Judge Rom&aacute;n also held that WDOMI lacked organizational standing, disagreeing with WDOMI that it suffered a concrete injury due to Lyft&rsquo;s policy because it was forced to divert resources to advocate for its members i.e., bring this lawsuit. The court held that litigation costs alone are not sufficient to allege a concrete injury, and dismissed the amended complaint with regard to WDOMI because it failed to allege separate harms. <em>Lowell v. Lyft, Inc.</em>, 352 F. Supp. 3d 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)</p>\r\n<p>Judge Rom&aacute;n further denied Lyft&rsquo;s motion with regard to enforcement of the arbitration clause. He held that direct benefits estoppel did not apply because the plaintiffs were not attempting to benefit from Lyft&rsquo;s terms of service&mdash;indeed their entire claim was that they were unable to benefit from Lyft&rsquo;s services due to discrimination. <em>Lowell v. Lyft, Inc.</em>, 352 F. Supp. 3d 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)</p>\r\n<p>Regarding Lyft&rsquo;s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Judge Rom&aacute;n granted the motion with respect to the plaintiffs&rsquo; NYCHRL claim but denied it with respect to their ADA and NYSHRL claims. Judge Rom&aacute;n held that the NYCHRL claims could not advance because Lyft did in fact offer accessible services within the city, and longer wait times did not give rise to a violation of the statute. In denying the motion with regard to the ADA and NYCHRL claims, which are analyzed under the same standards, Judge Rom&aacute;n disagreed with Lyft&rsquo;s characterization that the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint asked the court to order Lyft to provide WAV service. Instead, he held that the plaintiffs merely requested that the court enjoin Lyft from further violations of the ADA and NYCHRL, which was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>Lowell v. Lyft, Inc.</em>, 352 F. Supp. 3d 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)</p>\r\n<p>Following the court&rsquo;s ruling, Lyft filed its answer to the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint on January 15, 2019, denying almost all allegations and raising 15 affirmative defenses in total, essentially disputing that Lyft was a transportation company as defined by the ADA and alleging that the modifications sought by the plaintiffs were unreasonable and so not required by the ADA. The case then proceeded to discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2019, the plaintiffs withdrew their demand for a jury trial. On April 3, 2020, the case was reassigned to District Judge Phillip M. Halpern.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 15, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the court&rsquo;s ruling on Lyft&rsquo;s 2018 motion to dismiss because, according to the plaintiffs, the Second Circuit had examined and explicitly overruled the court&rsquo;s ruling regarding the individual plaintiff&rsquo;s NYCHRL claim (but not the WDOMI claim). Lyft did not oppose the motion, and on November 1, 2021 the court reinstated the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim under the NYCHRL due to the Second Circuit&rsquo;s ruling.</p>\r\n<p>On March 30, 2022, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the United Spinal Association, and the National Council for Independent Living submitted requests to file amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims, which the court granted the next day. The Association of Programs for Rural Independent Living, and the African-American Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities submitted amicus requests on April 6 and April 12 respectively, each granted the following day.</p>\r\n<p>Between January 2019 and August 2022, the parties filed numerous motions to seal discovery containing Lyft&rsquo;s proprietary information and motions to compel discovery. Notably, on May 10, 2022, Lyft moved for the court&rsquo;s permission to file a Daubert motion to exclude expert testimony offered by the plaintiffs in conjunction with their motion to certify the class. One of Lyft&rsquo;s main arguments against class certification was that the plaintiffs could not satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements because their proposed modifications wouldn&rsquo;t provide equal benefits to the whole class. Lyft argued that the testimony of an expert would be required to prove these elements, and it sought to challenge the expert&rsquo;s qualifications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lyft&rsquo;s motion was referred to Magistrate Judge Andrew E. Krause for report and recommendation, which he returned on July 5, 2022. Judge Krause denied Lyft&rsquo;s motion, holding that it went to the merits of the plaintiffs&rsquo; underlying claim and was more appropriately raised at the motion in limine stage of the litigation. The plaintiffs did suggest modifications in their motion to certify the class, but Judge Krause pointed out that in certifying a class, the court is not ruling on whether a reasonable modification exists. Rather, the question is whether the alleged injury the class has in common could be resolved with a single injunction. 2022 WL 17585670.</p>\r\n<p>While plaintiffs originally submitted their motion to certify the class on May 3, 2022, they formally moved to certify the class on August 26, 2022 after the court resolved several motions to seal. The plaintiff sought to certify the following classes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft aside from Lyft&rsquo;s Access Regions who required WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who were denied equal access to Lyft&rsquo;s transportation services under the ADA (the &ldquo;Non-Access Region Class&rdquo;);</li>\r\n<li>All residents of or visitors to the Access Regions Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, or San Francisco who required WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who were denied equal access to Lyft&rsquo;s transportation services under the ADA (the &ldquo;Access Regions Other Than NYC Class&rdquo;);</li>\r\n<li>All residents of or visitors to New York City who required WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who were denied equal access to Lyft&rsquo;s transportation services under the ADA, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL (the &ldquo;NYC Class&rdquo;);</li>\r\n<li>All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft in New York State aside from New York City who required WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who were denied equal access to Lyft&rsquo;s transportation services under the ADA and NYSHRL (the &ldquo;New York State Other Than NYC Class&rdquo;);</li>\r\n<li>All residents of or visitors to Westchester County who required WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who were denied equal access to Lyft&rsquo;s transportation services under the ADA and NYSHRL (the &ldquo;Westchester Class&rdquo;).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2022, Judge Halpern scheduled a bench trial for January 17, 2023 and set a September 2, 2022 deadline for the parties to file letters informing the court whether they intended to move for summary judgment in advance of trial. The parties filed a letter on September 2, 2022 jointly agreeing to forgo pre-trial summary judgment briefing, and the case proceeded into the pre-trial phase.</p>\r\n<p>The court held a pretrial conference on November 8, 2022 and subsequently ordered the parties to submit a new proposed pretrial order and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. In response, the parties submitted a letter on November 21, 2022, &nbsp;in which they agreed that the plaintiffs would withdraw the fifth claim of their complaint, which was for declaratory relief. The parties also indicated that they were unable to agree on which issues to present for trial. Lyft subsequently filed a motion requesting leave to file separate proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the court summarily denied on December 2, 2022, directing the parties to continue working to agree on simplified filings.</p>\r\n<p>On December 13, 2022, the court held another pretrial conference in which Judge Halpern adjourned the January 17, 2023 trial without rescheduling because the parties could not come to an agreement on a proposed joint pretrial order. The court gave the parties a new deadline of January 13, 2023 to file their proposed joint pretrial order and a January 20, 2023 deadline to file a brief outlining their disagreements over the burdens of proof for each claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 2022, Magistrate Judge Krause filed a recommendation that the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to certify classes be granted in part and denied in part. Judge Krause recommended the court certify the plaintiffs&rsquo; proposed &ldquo;Non-Access Region Class,&rdquo; the &ldquo;New York State Other Than NYC Class,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Westchester Class&rdquo; as defined above. He recommended that the court not certify the &ldquo;NYC Class&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Access Regions Other Than NYC Class&rdquo; on the grounds that the proposed class representatives for those groups lacked standing to pursue the claim. Specifically, those plaintiffs did not allege &nbsp;sufficiently concrete facts to support the claim that they had actual knowledge that downloading the Lyft app to try to receive service would be a &ldquo;futile gesture,&rdquo; which is the doctrine that originally conferred standing to the named plaintiff. Excluded from these classes were people who had downloaded the Lyft app (because of arbitration agreements and class waivers), who had filed separate lawsuits over WAV access, or who attended Ohio State University or the University of Texas at Austin and did not leave campus (because Lyft contractually provides service on those campuses). 2022 WL 19406561.</p>\r\n<p>To certify a class, plaintiffs must satisfy the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They must show that &ldquo;(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.&rdquo; If the Rule 23(a) prerequisites have been satisfied, then class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is appropriate when &ldquo;the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Judge Krause&rsquo; recommendation found that these elements were satisfied for the three remaining plaintiffs. Plaintiffs proved the numerosity requirement with statistics showing that 2.3 percent of the people living in the areas that would be covered by the class categories use wheelchairs and 36 percent of Americans have used rideshare services. Plaintiffs estimated that the Westchester Class alone would contain more than 6,000 members, which is well above the District&rsquo;s numerosity threshold of 40 class members. Commonality and typicality were satisfied because the putative class&rsquo;s alleged injury arose out of Lyft&rsquo;s uniform policies of not offering WAV access on its app. Judge Krause indicated that Lyft&rsquo;s challenge to these elements of class certification actually amounted to either challenges to plaintiffs&rsquo; standing or the merits of the underlying claim. Because Rule 23(a) was satisfied, Judge Krause further found that the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs could be provided to all members of each class, as required by Rule 23(b)(2). 2022 WL 19406561.</p>\r\n<p>Lyft subsequently filed an objection to Judge Krause&rsquo;s report, again arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they didn&rsquo;t identify when they intended to use the app, contravening the injury in fact prong of Article III standing. It also argued that the plaintiffs failed the numerosity and ascertainability requirements for class actions because they could not identify specific individuals who would benefit from the ruling. Several disabilities-rights organizations filed an amicus curiae brief in response to Lyft&rsquo;s objection on February 23, 2023. The brief, filed by Paralyzed Veterans &nbsp;of &nbsp;America, the United Spinal Association, the National Council on Independent Living, and Association of Programs for Rural Independent Living, argued that plaintiffs only need to indicate they intend to use the service when possible in order to satisfy the injury prong of standing, and that Lyft&rsquo;s argument regarding numerosity and ascertainability were irrelevant because the injunctive relief sought could equally apply to 700 people or 7,000 people.</p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2023, Judge Halpern issued an opinion that largely adopted Judge Krause&rsquo;s recommendation, with the additional holding that WDOMI did not have standing to assert the NYSHRL claims, as Judge Rom&aacute;n had ruled earlier in the case. The court rejected each of Lyft&rsquo;s objections to Judge Krause&rsquo;s recommendation, with substantial analysis of the Article III injury in fact requirement, holding that the named plaintiff&rsquo;s testimony and declarations sufficiently established her intention to use Lyft&rsquo;s service if and when the app allows WAV access in her region. 2023 WL 2622925.</p>\r\n<p>After the March 24, 2023 class-certification, the parties continued to confer about their proposed joint pretrial order and prepared for trial. On October 2, 2023, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed counts III and IV of their complaint&mdash;the counts pertaining to the NYCHRL&mdash;because the court had declined to certify the class of New York City plaintiffs. The new proposed joint pretrial order deadline was set to November 13, 2023, with an evidentiary hearing scheduled for December 12, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>On February 9, 2024, Judge Halpern issued an order scheduling a bench trial for July 8, 2024. On July 8, 2024, the bench trial began. The trial concluded on July 11, and the parties submitted post-trial briefs as ordered by Judge Halpern by July 26.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2024, Judge Halpern issued a decision in the case, finding for the defendant with prejudice. The judge found that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently proved that their requested accommodations would be effective or reasonable, saying that there was not sufficient evidence to find that the removal of the toggle would actually work to have more WAV availability and that there would be a sufficient 'organic' supply of WAVs. The judge was not convinced by the plaintiffs' second proposed modification either, finding that plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence that asking all drivers on Lyft's platform if they own a WAV would meaningfully increase the supply of WAVs; he argued that the second modification amounted to a 'trial and error' solution that was not sufficient as a reasonable modification under the ADA. Since the other modifications hinge on the first two, he dismissed them out of hand and found for the defendants.</p>",

ECF CASE \n \nLYFT, INC.,  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nDefendant. \n \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nPlaintiff Harriet Lowell (“Plaintiff”), by and through her undersigned attorneys, on behalf \nof themselves and on behalf of all others similarly situated, hereby make the following \nallegations against Defendant Lyft, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Lyft”), with personal knowledge as to \nher own actions, and upon information and belief as to those of others: \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  This actions seeks to redress Defendant’s ongoing discrimination against disabled \nindividuals, particularly people who require the use of wheelchairs or other assistive devices for \nmobility.   \n2.  Transportation access is a central civil rights issue for people with disabilities.  In \n1978 in Denver, the lack of accessible transportation led a group of wheelchair users to block \nbusses with their own bodies to protest the buses’ inaccessibility.  That protest grew to a national \nmovement and, in 1990, led to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), with \n   \n{00286654  }\n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 2 of 28\n \nits guarantee of full participation in all aspects of society, working to end the historical isolation \nand segregation of people with disabilities.   \n3.  In passing the ADA, Congress embraced a national mandate to eliminate \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities, including discrimination in travel services.  As a \nHouse Committee report on the bill that would become the ADA aptly stated:  “Transportation is \nthe linchpin which enables people with disabilities to be integrated and mainstreamed into \nsociety.”  Without reliable transportation options, people cannot maintain employment, obtain \nhealthcare, visit friends and family, or otherwise be full and regular participants in civil life.   \n4.  However, as new technologies and innovations are creating a watershed change in \ntransportation services across the United States, some of the emerging leaders in the public \nconveyance and transportation industry, including Defendant, are implementing pervasive and \nsystematic policies of discrimination against disabled individuals.  With these new transportation \nservices rapidly supplanting traditional public conveyances, such discriminatory policies threaten \na return to the isolation and segregation that the disability rights movement has fought to \novercome. \n5.  Defendant is one of the most prominent companies in the revolutionary and \ndisruptive new smartphone application-based ridesharing transportation industry, which provides \nnew freedom of travel for many people throughout the United States, including in New York \nCity and Westchester County.  Lyft and similar companies are now a significant part of the \nnational transportation system and are positioning themselves to be an indispensable part of the \ntransportation systems of the future. \n6.  Lyft, like other ridesharing transportation companies, uses an electronic ride-\nhailing application, available for use on smartphones, to allow users of this application to \n  2 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 3 of 28\n \nsummon drivers to their location, designate a destination, and make payments electronically.  \nThis provides millions of riders with the highly convenient ability to arrange cheap, door-to-door \ntransportation with just a few minutes’ notice. \n7.  Defendant has secured its prominent position in the ridesharing market by \nrepresenting to consumers that it will provide consumers with a ride from a friendly driver within \nminutes.  As a result, Lyft generates billions of dollars in revenue annually. \n8.  Were it to be reliably accessible to people who use wheelchairs and other assistive \ndevices, Lyft’s transportation service could have life-changing effects for such individuals, \nimproving their ability to work, study, participate in community life, and generally to live more \nindependently. \n9.  However, the reality is that Lyft’s promises of accommodation are only available \nto able-bodied consumers.  As a large-scale public accommodation, Lyft has demonstrated a total \ndisregard for the needs of people with disabilities in the provision of its transportation services, \nand has persistently and systematically failed to ensure that these services are available to \ndisabled individuals. \n10.  As a result, disabled individuals are routinely denied accommodations in \ntransportation on the basis of their disabilities.  As a provider of public conveyances and public \naccommodations, Lyft’s ongoing policies and practices thus deny equal service to disabled \nindividuals in violation of federal, state, and local laws. \n11.  This suit is brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n12181, et seq., the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law § 290, et seq., \n(“NYSHRL”), and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq., \n(“NYCHRL”). \n  3 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 4 of 28\n \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Harriet Lowell is a citizen of New York residing in White Plains, New \nYork.   \n13.  Plaintiff has a mobility disability that substantially limits the major life activity of \nwalking.  Plaintiff typically uses a motorized scooter to travel.  In order for Plaintiff to travel by \ncar or van, the vehicle must be equipped with a ramp or lift to accommodate her scooter.  \nPlaintiff is a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. \n14.  Plaintiff would like to use Lyft’s transportation services, both in Westchester \nCounty and in her trips to and from New York City.  However, Plaintiff has been deterred from \nusing Lyft’s transportation services because she is aware that Lyft discriminates against people \nwith mobility disabilities in its transportation services. \n15.  Plaintiff plans to and will attempt to use Lyft’s ride-hailing application and Lyft’s \nprograms, services, facilities, and accommodations in the future, should those programs, \nservices, and facilities, and accommodations become wheelchair accessible. \n16.  Plaintiff presently fears that she will encounter the mobility-related barriers and \nunequal services which exist within Lyft’s transportation system. \n17.  Plaintiff continues to desire to utilize Lyft’s ride-hailing application and \ntransportation services, but will continue to be deterred until the violations detailed herein are \nremoved. \n18.  Defendant Lyft, Inc. is a foreign corporation, organized and existing under the \nlaws of the State of Delaware, with its principal place of business located in San Francisco, \nCalifornia.  It is a ridesharing transportation company, providing transportation services, public \nconveyance, and public accommodation to customers in the United States, including New York.  \nIt has thousands of customers in New York and elsewhere, and billions of dollars in revenues. \n  4 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 5 of 28\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Title III of the \nADA.  Plaintiff also seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and compensatory damages \npursuant to the NYSHRL and NYCHRL.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction under the \nprovisions of the ADA pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 and 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and supplemental \njurisdiction over Plaintiff’s remaining claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, because those claims \nare related to Plaintiff’s federal claims and rise out of a common nucleus of operative facts.  \n20.  This Court has diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1) because \nthe parties to this action are citizens of different states. \n21.  Venue is appropriate in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), because \nPlaintiff resides in this District, and were denied equal service in this District on the basis of her \ndisabilities.  Defendant is also liable for systemically denying accommodation in transportation \nto disabled individuals throughout this District; Defendant maintains significant business \ncontacts within this District; and Defendant engaged in the unlawful conduct alleged in this \nComplaint within this District. \n22.  Following the commencement of this action, a copy of this Complaint will be \nserved on both the New York City Commission for Human Rights and the Office of the \nCorporation Counsel of the City of New York, thereby satisfying the notice requirements of the \nNew York City Administrative Code. \nBACKGROUND FACTS \n23.  Millions of people in the United States depend on a wheelchair or other assistive \ndevices for day-to-day tasks and mobility.  In New York City alone, as of 2014, more than \n500,000 non-institutionalized residents have a mobility-related disability.  Hundreds of \n  5 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 6 of 28\n \nthousands of people with disabilities, moreover, visit New York City, Westchester County, and \nother regions across the country serviced by Lyft each year.  \n24.  Plaintiff relies on compliance by public accommodations, including transportation \nservices, with local, state, and federal disability accessibility requirements, in order to gain equal \naccess to all services as people without disabilities. \n25.  In or about 2012, Defendant launched its ride-hailing application to connect riders \nand drivers to provide public conveyance and transportation services across urban and suburban \nareas across the United States.  Lyft began offering its public conveyance services in New York \nCity on or about July 25, 2014, and presently offers its services in Westchester County, as well. \n26.  By using Lyft’s ride-hailing application, a customer can remotely hail a nearby \nLyft vehicle, select a destination to which he or she wishes to be driven, and have all payments \nfor this conveyance electronically processed. \n27.  However, since its inception and throughout its operation in New York City, \nWestchester County, and in hundreds of other regions throughout the United States, Lyft has \nremained a relatively unregulated public transportation entity. \n28.  For instance, unlike New York’s traditional Yellow and Green Boro Taxi cabs, as \nwell as “For-Hire” Livery Vehicles, Lyft’s drivers and public conveyance operations remain \nlargely beyond the purview of the Taxi and Limousine Commission’s (“TLC”) rules and \nregulations with respect to accessibility for disabled individuals. \n29.  While Lyft requires that its New York City drivers be registered with the TLC, it \nis not subject to the TLC’s 2014 agreement to enact regulations so as to render 50% of all \ntaxicabs operating in New York City accessible to individuals requiring the use of a wheelchair \n  6 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 7 of 28\n \nby 2020.1  Instead, Lyft continues to operate without any regulatory requirement that it purchase, \nconvert, or provide accessible vehicles to the public. \n30.  Lyft provides a valuable transportation alternative to millions of individuals \nthroughout the United States, allowing people to more easily travel to work, social events, \ncommunity engagements, appointments, and other destinations, yet Lyft pervasively and \nsystematically excludes people with mobility disabilities from these same benefits of its \nconvenient transportation. \n31.  Lyft and its fellow application-based ride-sharing transportation companies are \nquickly supplanting traditional taxi companies and becoming the public’s primary option for on-\ndemand transportation services. \n32.  Lyft’s quarterly ridership more than doubled between the fourth quarter of 2015, \nwhen it logged 21.1 million rides, to the fourth quarter of 2016, when it logged 52.6 million \nrides. \n33.  Conversely, traditional taxicab ridership has declined.  In New York City alone, \nthe average number of yellow cab rides decreased by over 120,000 rides per day between \nNovember 2010 and November 2016.  \n34.  As ridesharing companies, like Lyft, grow, it could be an especially crucial \ntransportation option for people with disabilities because other transportation options also have \nsignificant barriers to access.  For example, the New York City subway system is largely \nunusable by people with disabilities, as almost 80% of its stations are inaccessible for anyone \n                                                           \n1 This agreement was reached as part of a settlement in a federal class action:  The Taxis For All \nCampaign, et al. v. New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, et al., No. 11-237, ECF No. \n220-1 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). \n  7 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 8 of 28\n \nwho cannot use stairs.  And even if the subways were completely accessible, the system does not \nextend to many New York City neighborhoods the way that Lyft does. \n35.  New York City’s bus system is even more limited, particularly after major service \ncuts that have occurred over the past decade, and is an agonizingly slow and largely inefficient \nmeans of travel overall. \n36.  New York City’s paratransit system has been widely criticized as ineffective, and \nit provides users with a dramatically more limited level of service than is available to riders who \nare able to reliably use subways and buses. \n37.  On-demand transportation services, such as Lyft, can fill the significant \ntransportation gaps for riders with disabilities, if providers operate these services in a non-\ndiscriminatory way. \n38.  However, Lyft does not operate its services in a non-discriminatory way. \n39.  In Westchester County and many other cities and regions where Lyft provides its \ntransportation service, Lyft does not make wheelchair-accessible vehicles available at all. \n40.  People with mobility disabilities must toggle on the “Access Mode” function in \nthe Lyft smartphone application to attempt to be matched with a wheelchair-accessible vehicle. \n41.  In the numerous cities and regions where Lyft does not make any wheelchair-\naccessible vehicles available, including Westchester County, customers with Access Mode \nenabled who attempt to use the Lyft smartphone application to hail a ride are simply sent a text \nmessage with information on other transportation services in the area.  As Lyft itself \nacknowledges on its website, “Many of [these] accessible vehicle dispatches must be booked at \nleast 24 hours in advance,” and that “it may take several weeks to complete the enrollment \n  8 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 9 of 28\n \nprocess before being able to book a ride” with such vendors thereby defeating the primary \nbenefits of Lyft’s service, e.g. convenience and the ability to hail a ride on short notice.2  \n42.  Even in cities and regions where Lyft does make some wheelchair-accessible \nvehicles available, such vehicles typically make up only an extremely small portion of Lyft’s \nvehicle fleet.  Thus, customers with Access Mode enabled routinely experience significantly \nlonger wait times to be matched with a wheelchair-accessible vehicle.  \n43.  Lyft exercises very significant, comprehensive, and detailed control over its \ntransportation services and drivers. \n44.  Lyft decides who may provide its transportation services.  Individuals who wish \nto drive as part of the Lyft transportation service undergo a screening process and must be at \nleast 21 years of age, complete various forms, undergo a driving record check, undergo a check \nfor registered sex offender status, undergo a seven-year criminal background check, complete an \nin-person interview with a current Lyft driver, and present their driver’s license (which they must \nhave had for more than 1 year), vehicle registration, and proof of driver’s insurance.  In addition, \nbefore a driver may use a vehicle to provide Lyft services in New York City, the driver must \nobtain a TLC commercial license. \n45.  Lyft exercises exclusive control over termination of Lyft drivers.  Lyft routinely \nterminates drivers for any of several reasons, including for poor customer satisfaction ratings or \ndiscriminatorily refusing to provide service to customers. \n46.  Lyft controls which trip requests it transmits to each of its drivers. \n                                                           \n2 See Lyft.com, “Accessible Vehicle Dispatch,” available at  \nhttps://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/213584508-Accessible-vehicle-dispatch (last visited Aug. \n11, 2017). \n  9 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 10 of 28\n \n47.  Lyft requires all drivers to provide it with information about the make, model, and \nage of the vehicle that they will drive while providing Lyft transportation. \n48.  Lyft sets standards for which vehicles can be driven to provide Lyft \ntransportation. \n49.  Lyft also sets standards for which vehicles can be driven for various classes of \nLyft transportation services, such as Lyft, Lyft Plus, and Lyft Premier. \n50.  Lyft prohibits its drivers from discriminating against people based on race, \nreligion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex, marital status, gender identity, age, or \nany other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law. \n51.  Lyft instructs drivers that they should consistently accept a high share of the trip \nrequests that they receive through Lyft’s app. \n52.  Lyft prohibits drivers from accepting street hails from potential passengers. \n53.  Lyft encourages drivers to provide personal information to their respective \nprofiles, as available through the Lyft smartphone application, including information such as the \ndriver’s hometown and music preferences. \n54.  In addition, Lyft issues training and directives concerning other requirements to \nLyft drivers. \n55.  Lyft closely monitors its drivers. \n56.  Lyft records numerous details about the rides that its drivers provide, including \nthe pickup location, time of pickup, drop off location, time of drop off, distance traveled, route \ntaken, trip duration, and customer’s identity for each trip. \n57.  Furthermore, Lyft also monitors its drivers’ performance by asking customers for \nwritten feedback and a 1 to 5 “star” rating for each ride to be provided after every trip via the \n  10 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 11 of 28\n \nLyft smartphone application.  Lyft likewise allows its drivers to rate and provide feedback on \ncustomers.  \n58.  Lyft regularly terminates or suspends Lyft drivers whose average customer rating \nfalls below a certain threshold. \n59.  In addition, Lyft maintains commercial liability policies for each driver to cover \nclaims concerning incidents that occur while drivers are providing Lyft transportation services. \n60.  Lyft tightly controls payments for its transportation services. \n61.  Lyft likewise controls who may use Lyft’s transportation services. \n62.  Lyft makes its services available only to members of the public who have a credit \ncard and a smartphone capable of running one of Lyft’s applications, who create a Lyft account, \nand who request a ride through Lyft’s smartphone application, or to individuals traveling with \nthese Lyft customers or in vehicles ordered by these Lyft customers. \n63.  Customers do not pay Lyft’s drivers directly. \n64.  Lyft automatically charges a customer’s credit card after the rider arrives that the \ndesired destination. \n65.  Customers can also provide gratuities to drivers through the Lyft application. \n66.  Lyft has exclusive control over the fares that customers pay and the compensation \nthat its drivers receive.  \n67.  Fares for Lyft’s transportation services are based on the duration and distance of \neach trip and other factors such as demand at the time and place of the ride, as determined by \nLyft. \n68.  Lyft keeps a percentage of each fare. \n  11 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 12 of 28\n \n69.  Thus, Lyft compensates its drivers based on the duration and distance of the trips \nthat they provide to riders.  Payments are not transferred directly from customers to drivers; \nrather, Lyft collects and holds customer payments, deducts fees, and then later transfers money \nto drivers. \n70.  Customers who dispute the fare for a particular trip must contact Lyft customer \nservice representatives to request an adjustment to their fares. \n71.  Lyft encourages its drivers to provide feedback, in the form of a rating of one to \nfive “stars,” for riders. \n72.  Thus, Lyft closely monitors and controls interactions between its drivers and \ncustomers. \n73.  Across the United States, in approximately 300 cities and regions, Lyft provides \ntransportation services totaling approximately 18.7 million rides per month through its fleet of \nvehicles. \n74.  This massive transportation service allows members of the public to quickly and \nefficiently obtain a ride through Lyft. \n75.  Customers choose which class of Lyft service they want.  Customers can choose, \nfor instance, Lyft services that provide luxury vehicles, standard vehicles, and large vehicles.  In \nmany cities, customers can choose to use an option that will carpool passengers with other riders \nheading in the same direction for a reduced fare. \n76.  Customers select the class of Lyft service they want, and then request a vehicle. \n77.  Lyft’s application matches the rider with a nearby driver who is providing \ntransportation service with the requested class of vehicle.  For example, a customer who requests \na Lyft Plus service will be matched with a driver operating a six-seater vehicle. \n  12 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 13 of 28\n \n78.  After the Lyft application matches the rider and the driver, the driver picks up the \nrider and transports the rider to the rider’s desired destination. \n79.  While Lyft offers a range of services and classes of vehicles, the overwhelming \nmajority of the vehicles in its fleet are not wheelchair accessible. \n80.  By denying disabled individuals accommodation in the form of accessible \nvehicles, Lyft also denies disabled individuals who require such accommodations the ability and \nright to utilize and enjoy the attractive features that have made Lyft’s services so popular and \ndesired.  These services are not available with taxicab services. \n81.  These features include the ability to pay for a ride without using cash or \npresenting a credit card because Lyft charges the customer’s previously-entered credit card \ninstantly when the vehicle reaches the rider’s destination. \n82.  Another key Lyft feature is the ability to call for a ride from anywhere in New \nYork City and throughout Westchester County without having to identify a particular company \nthat serves the neighborhood where the customer is presently located.  Taxi companies and \nneighborhood livery services often serve only limited geographical areas, but Lyft is available \nthroughout New York City and Westchester County, as well as in hundreds of other cities across \nthe United States. \n83.  Lyft offers door-to-door service across New York City and Westchester County, \nas well as in hundreds of other cities across the United States, and has precise locator technology.  \nThis is unlike taxi services, which typically must be hailed on major thoroughfares, or livery \nvehicles, which typically must be called via telephone with an address specified. \n  13 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 14 of 28\n \n84.  Lyft vehicles typically are higher-end vehicles than those used as medallion taxis \nor livery vehicles, giving the rider the feeling of traveling in an exclusive, safe, and private \nvehicle rather than a typical taxicab. \n85.  When Lyft fails to provide full and equal service to disabled individuals who \nrequire wheelchair-accessible vehicles, these individuals experience numerous harms. \n86.  At times, because of delays or a total lack of wheelchair-accessible vehicle \navailability, disabled individuals must arrange alternate transportation that is sometimes more \ncostly and significantly less convenient. \n87.  People who use wheelchairs also face the denigrating experience of being denied \na basic service that is available to all other paying customers. \n88.  Even when a wheelchair-accessible vehicle is technically available, because so \nfew exist there are typically frequent and lengthy delays.  Thus, people who require such \nvehicles and use Lyft’s services are harmed because they must contend with missed \nappointments, being late for events, and other stress and inconvenience related to these delays. \n89.  By denying equal service to riders needing wheelchair-accessible vehicles, Lyft \ncauses real harm by interfering with their ability to work, attend school, shop for groceries, \nreceive medical care, enjoy entertainment and cultural events, maintain family and social ties, \nand otherwise participate fully in civil life.  \n90.  Due to distances between destinations and the severe limitations of public \ntransportation and paratransit, many persons with disabilities must use private transportation \nservices to travel from one place to another.  Such alternative transportation may be more costly, \nless convenient and/or less comfortable. \n  14 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 15 of 28\n \n91.  When people do not have ready access to transportation, they suffer significant \nsocial isolation and seclusion as well as other harms. \n92.  Plaintiff was given notice that Lyft has very few wheelchair-accessible vehicles in \nits service, and that people who need such vehicles often cannot get service from a Lyft vehicle \nat all, or frequently have wait times far longer than people who do not need such vehicles.   \n93.  Plaintiff is aware of the ongoing discrimination by Lyft against people with \ndisabilities because she has heard from friends and acquaintances who have mobility disabilities \nand have witnessed Lyft’s failure to provide equivalent, non-discriminatory service.  For \nexample, when Plaintiff’s friend in White Plains tried to order an accessible Lyft, he was told \nthat none were available and received a text message from Lyft advising him to obtain alternate \nmethods of transit.  Plaintiff’s friend recounted this experience to Plaintiff thereafter. \n94.  Because Lyft does not provide equal service to people with disabilities who need \nwheelchair-accessible vehicles, such as Plaintiff, she has been deterred from trying to access \nLyft’s transportation services, knowing that the attempt would be futile. \n95.  Plaintiff commutes from White Plains, New York, to New York City and back \napproximately twice each month, including monthly healthcare visits.  Plaintiff would like to \ntravel to and from New York City more often, but is presently limited by inadequate \ntransportation options available to her as Westchester County’s paratransit service does not \nextend to New York City and New York City’s subways and public transportation options are \nlargely inaccessible to her.  Currently, she is only able to travel to, from, and throughout New \nYork City when her husband is available to drive her in his wheelchair-accessible van.   \n  15 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 16 of 28\n \n96.  When Plaintiff’s husband is unavailable to driver her, her ability to travel is \nsignificantly reduced.  When her husband was undergoing surgery in New York City, she was \nunable to visit him. \n97.  If Plaintiff had reliable access to Lyft’s transportation services, she would like to \ntravel to, from, and around New York City more often. \n98.  Within White Plains and Westchester County, Plaintiff is also limited in her \nmobility.  Due to local paratransit’s limited availability and long wait times, she is often unable \nto travel to locations within the region.   \n99.  As with many scooters and motorized wheelchairs, Plaintiff’s scooter is not \nwaterproof, and its battery can easily short circuit in the rain.  Her assistive device is also not \ndesigned for travel over snow or dirt-covered surfaces, where it can skid, sink, or otherwise \neasily get stuck.  Due to her chair not being waterproof or easy to operate in the snow, Plaintiff is \noften unable to travel even relatively short distances when it is raining or snowing. \n100.  If Plaintiff had reliable access to Lyft’s transportation services, she would like to \ntravel to locations within Westchester County more often, including at times when inclement \nweather currently prevents her from traveling even relatively short distances in her motorized \nwheelchair. \n101.  Plaintiff has not signed up for an account with Lyft. \n102.  Plaintiff is aware that Lyft provides affordable, efficient, and convenient \ntransportation services to individuals who do not use wheelchairs, and she would use Lyft if \nequal services and benefits were available to her and other individuals with mobility disabilities \nwho require wheelchair accessible vehicles.  \n  16 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 17 of 28\n \n103.  The harm to Plaintiff is on-going as Lyft continues to employ an inherently \ndiscriminatory business model that denies disabled passengers, such as Plaintiff, services by \nrefusing to equip its vehicles in a manner to as to make them accessible. \n104.  As such, absent Court intervention, Plaintiff will continue to suffer from Lyft’s \ndiscriminatory practices indefinitely. \n105.  Because Lyft closely controls, monitors, supervises, and manages its drivers and \nvehicle fleet, Lyft is capable of adopting the policy changes and taking the steps necessary to \nensure that its fleet provides equal access to riders who require wheelchair accessible vehicles. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n106.  Plaintiff brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief on her own behalf, \nand on behalf of all persons similarly situated, including all residents in and visitors to all cities \nand regions serviced by Defendant with mobility disabilities who have been and are currently \nbeing discriminated against by Defendant’s actions and omissions as alleged herein. \n107.  Plaintiff also brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief on her own \nbehalf and on behalf of a subclass consisting of all persons similarly situated and all residents in \nand visitors to all cities and regions located in New York State serviced by Defendant with \nmobility disabilities who have been and are currently being discriminated against by Defendant’s \nactions and omissions as alleged herein.  (“New York State Subclass”) \n108.  Plaintiff also brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief on her own \nbehalf and on behalf of a subclass consisting of all persons similarly situated and all residents in \nand visitors to New York City with mobility disabilities who have been and are currently being \ndiscriminated against by Defendant’s actions and omissions as alleged herein.  (“New York City \nSubclass”) \n  17 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 18 of 28\n \n109.  The class Plaintiff seeks to represent consists of all people with mobility \ndisabilities who are residents in or visitors to any and all cities and regions serviced by Lyft who \nrequire wheelchair accessible vehicles for vehicular transportation, and who want to, but have \nbeen deterred from, signing up for Lyft’s transportation network because it does not provide \nequal service to people who require wheelchair accessible vehicles. \n110.  The New York State Subclass Plaintiff seeks to represent consists of all people \nwith mobility disabilities who are residents in or visitors to any and all cities and regions located \nin New York State serviced by Lyft who require wheelchair accessible vehicles for vehicular \ntransportation, and who want to but have been deterred from signing up for Lyft’s transportation \nnetwork because it does not provide equal service to people who require wheelchair accessible \nvehicles. \n111.  The New York City Subclass Plaintiff seeks to represent consists of all people \nwith mobility disabilities who are residents in or visitors to New York City who require \nwheelchair accessible vehicles for vehicular transportation, and who want to but have been \ndeterred from signing up for Lyft’s transportation network because it does not provide equal \nservice to people who require wheelchair accessible vehicles. \n112.  The persons in the class and subclasses are so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers of the class is impracticable and the disposition of their claims in a class action is a \nbenefit to the parties and the Court. \n113.  There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact \ninvolved affecting the parties to be represented, in that Plaintiff’s members and individuals in the \nclass and subclasses will continue to be denied access to Lyft’s transportation service because of \nits lack of accessible riders. \n  18 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 19 of 28\n \n114.  Common questions of law and fact predominate, including the question of \nwhether Defendant’s failure to provide accessible vehicles discriminates against individuals with \nmobility disabilities in violation of the ADA, NYSHRL, and/or NYCHRL. \n115.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical and are not in conflict with the interests of the class \nor subclass as a whole.  Defendant’s course of conduct and violation of the law as alleged herein \nhas caused Plaintiff and the class and subclass members to be deprived of their rights under the \nADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL.  Therefore, all class members and subclass members will suffer \nthe same or similar injuries for the purpose of the injunctive and declaratory relief sought.  \nPlaintiff’s claims are thereby representative of an co-extensive with the claims of the class and \nsubclasses.  Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the class. \n116.  The attorneys representing the class are well qualified and experienced in class \naction litigation.  Counsel are qualified to fully prosecute this litigation on behalf of Plaintiff and \nthe class and subclasses, and possess adequate resources to see this matter through to resolution. \n117.  Defendant has acted and failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the class \nas a whole, thereby making appropriate finale declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I – DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION \nOF TITLE III OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILTIES ACT \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff And The Nationwide Class) \n118.  Plaintiff repeats, realleges, and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n119.  Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full \nand equal enjoyment of specified public transportation services provided by private entities \n  19 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 20 of 28\n \nprimarily engaged in the business of transporting people and whose operations affect commerce.  \n42 U.S.C. § 12184. \n120.  Plaintiff and members of the nationwide class are all persons with disabilities, i.e., \nphysical impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities.  42 U.S.C. § \n12102(1)(A). \n121.  Defendant is an entity primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. \n122.  Defendant provides specified public transportation services within the meaning of \nthe term under Title III of the ADA on a regular and continuing basis. \n123.  Defendant’s operations affect interstate commerce, including by providing \ntransportation across state lines from New York to New Jersey and vice versa. \n124.  Title III of the ADA also prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the \nfull and equal enjoyment of services provided by places of public accommodations.  42 U.S.C. § \n12182.  Public accommodations, under the ADA, explicitly include travel services.  42 U.S.C. § \n12181(7)(f) \n125.  Defendant operates a public accommodation subject to Title III’s non-\ndiscrimination requirements.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12181, 12182. \n126.  Defendant operates a “travel service” as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12181. \n127.  Defendant operates a “demand responsive system” as defined by 42 U.S.C. § \n12181(3). \n128.  Through its ongoing policies and procedures, the opportunities that Lyft offers \npeople with mobility disabilities to participate in or benefit from it services, advantages, and \naccommodations are not equal to the opportunities that Lyft provides to other individuals.  49 \nU.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii). \n  20 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 21 of 28\n \n129.  By failing to make wheelchair accessible vehicles adequately available through its \ntransportation services, Defendant denies individual who use motorized and other non-folding \nwheelchairs, including Plaintiff and class members, full and equal enjoyment of Defendant’s \nservices in violation of Title III of the ADA. \n130.  By forcing users of motorized and other non-folding wheelchairs to wait \nsignificantly longer to obtain rides from wheelchair-accessible vehicles than other users wait to \nobtain rides through its transportation services, Defendant denies such individuals, including \nPlaintiff and class members, full and equal enjoyment of Defendant’s services in violation of \nTitle III of the ADA. \n131.  By failing to make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and \nprocedures to make wheelchair accessible vehicles available with equivalent reliability and \nsimilar wait times as inaccessible vehicles, Defendant denies users of motorized and other non-\nfolding wheelchairs, including Plaintiff and class members, full and equal enjoyment of \nDefendant’s transportation service in violation of Title III of the ADA. \n132.  Plaintiff and members of the nationwide class have been injured by Defendant’s \nunlawful conduct in violation of Title III of the ADA. \n133.  Defendant’s conduct constitutes an ongoing and continuing violation of the ADA \nand, unless restrained from doing so, Defendant will continue to violate the ADA.  Said conduct \nhas injured Plaintiff and members of the nationwide class, and, unless enjoined, will continue to \ninflict injuries for which Plaintiff and class members have no adequate remedy at law. \nCOUNT II – DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION IN  \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK STATE HUMAN RIGHTS LAW \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff And The New York State Subclass) \n134.  Plaintiff repeats, realleges, and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n  21 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 22 of 28\n \n135.  The NYSHRL provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for \nany person being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent or employee of \nany place of public accommodation . . . [b]ecause of the . . . disability . . . of any person, directly \nor indirectly to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person any of the accommodations, \nadvantages, facilities or privileges thereof.”  N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(a).  \n136.  Plaintiff and all members of the New York State subclass are all “persons,” as \ndefined under N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(1), with “disabilities,” as defined under N.Y. Exec. Law § \n292(21).   \n137.  The term “place of public accommodation” encompasses “all public conveyances \noperated on land or water or in the air.”  N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(9). \n138.  Defendant is an “owner” or “proprietor” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n139.  Defendant also acts as a “manager” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n140.  Defendant is a “person” within N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(1). \n141.  Through its pervasive operations in providing on-demand transportation services \nto the general public and to residents and visitors of cities and regions throughout New York \nState, Defendant provides public conveyances to the public as defined in N.Y. Exec. Law § 292 \n(9). \n142.  Defendant’s deliberate failure to equip its vehicles and/or to require its drivers to \noperate accessible vehicles for the benefit of persons with disabilities requesting its services is an \nunlawful and prohibited discriminatory practice. \n143.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the NYSHRL, \nPlaintiff and members of the New York State Subclass have been injured as set forth herein. \n  22 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 23 of 28\n \nCOUNT III – DENIAL OF FULL AND EQUAL ENJOYMENT IN  \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK CITY HUMAN RIGHTS LAW \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff And The New York City Subclass) \n144.  Plaintiff repeats, realleges, and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n145.  The NYCHRL provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for \nany person who is the owner, franchisor, franchisee, lessor, lessee, proprietor, manager, \nsuperintendent, agent or employee of any place or provider of public accommodation . . . \n[b]ecause of any person’s actual or perceived . . . disability . . . directly or indirectly . . . [t]o \nrefuse, withhold from or deny to such person the full and equal enjoyment, on equal terms and \nconditions, of any of the accommodations, advantages, services, facilities or privileges of the \nplace or provider of public accommodation.”  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(4)(a).  The \nNYCHRL further prohibits any form of communication that services are not fully and equally \navailable on account of disability. \n146.  Plaintiff and all members of the New York City subclass are all “persons,” as \ndefined under N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(1), with “disabilities,” as defined under N.Y.C. \nAdmin. Code § 8-102(16)(a).   \n147.  The term “place or provider of public accommodation” encompasses “providers, \nwhether licensed or unlicensed, of goods, services, facilities, accommodations, advantages or \nprivileges of any kind, and places whether licensed or unlicensed, where goods services, \nfacilities, accommodations, advantages or privileges of any kind are extended, offered, sold or \notherwise made available.”  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(9). \n148.  Transportation services that are provided to the public, including Lyft, constitute a \nservice, accommodation, advantage, or privilege that is offered to the general public within the \nmeaning of N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(9). \n  23 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 24 of 28\n \n149.  Defendant is an “owner” or “proprietor” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n150.  Defendant also acts as a “manager” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n151.  Defendant is a “person” within N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(1). \n152.  The services, accommodations, advantages, and privileges that Defendant makes \navailable to the general public are such that Defendant, in its role as the Lyft transportation \nsystem’s owner, proprietor, and/or manager, violates N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(4)(a). \n153.  Defendant’s violations of the NYCHRL are particularly grave in light of the \nuniquely remedial purpose behind the NYCHRL, which provides that each section must be \n“construed liberally for the accomplishment of the uniquely broad and remedial purposes \nthereof, regardless of whether federal or New York state civil and human rights laws, including \nthose laws with provisions worded comparably to provisions of this title, have been so \nconstrued.”  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-130. \n154.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the NYCHRL, \nPlaintiff and members of the New York City Subclass have been injured as set forth herein. \nCOUNT IV – DISPARATE IMPACT IN  \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK CITY HUMAN RIGHTS LAW \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff And The New York City Subclass) \n155.  Plaintiff repeats, realleges, and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n156.  Defendant’s conduct also violates N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(17), which states \nthat “an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . is established . . . [when a plaintiff] demonstrates \nthat a policy or practice of a covered entity or group of policies or practices of a covered entity \nresults in a disparate impact to the detriment of any group protected by the provisions of this \nchapter.” \n  24 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 25 of 28\n \n157.  By failing to operate its transportation service so that it is readily accessible and \nusable by people who use wheelchairs when viewed in its entirety, Defendant has demonstrated a \npolicy or practice that has a disproportionately negative impact on Plaintiff and members of the \nproposed class, each of whom qualifies as a member of a protected group under the provisions of \nthe NYCHRL. \n158.  In particular, as described herein, Lyft’s use of a separate Access Mode for its \nsmartphone application ensures that customers who require wheelchair accessible vehicles are \neither denied service from Lyft altogether, and instead directed to other, less-convenient \nproviders, or are subjected to significantly longer wait times given the lack of wheelchair \naccessible vehicles in Lyft’s own fleet. \n159.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the NYCHRL, \nPlaintiff and members of the New York City Subclass have been injured as set forth herein. \nCOUNT V – DECLARATORY RELIEF \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff And Nationwide Class) \n160.  Plaintiff repeats, realleges, and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n161.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the Parties in that \nPlaintiff contends, and is informed and believes that Defendant denies, that Defendant has \ndiscriminated against the class by failing to adopt policies and procedures that would provide \npeople with mobility disabilities who require wheelchair accessible vehicles with full and equal \nenjoyment, on equal terms and conditions, of the services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \naccommodations of Lyft’s transportation services. \n162.  Defendant fails to comply with applicable laws, including but not limited to the \nADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. \n  25 \n{00286654  }\n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251   Document 1   Filed 08/17/17   Page 26 of 28\n \n163.

HALPERN, U.S.D.J. \n  Currently before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  ECF No. 282.1  \nPlaintiffs, who assert claims of disability discrimination based on the alleged failure of \nDefendant Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft” or “Defendant”) to provide wheelchair accessible vehicle (“WAV”) \nservices, seek certification of five different injunctive relief classes pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Lyft opposes the motion on the grounds that: (i) all of the \nproposed class representatives lack standing; (ii) the classes as defined include individuals who \nlack standing; and (iii) Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a) or Rule 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  ECF No. 295 (“Def.’s Opp.”).2 \n \n  1 ECF No. 338 is the public version of Plaintiffs’ moving brief, and ECF No. 284 is an \nunredacted version of the brief filed under seal.  Certain information in the public version is \nredacted because the information comes from documents and other discovery material that have \nbeen designated by the parties as confidential pursuant to the amended stipulated protective order \nfiled in this action.  See ECF No. 67. \n  2 ECF No. 295 is the public version of Lyft’s opposition brief, and ECF No. 296 is an \nunredacted version of the opposition brief filed under seal. \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 2 of 49\n  For the reasons that follow, I respectfully recommend that Plaintiffs’ motion for class \ncertification be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. \nBACKGROUND3 \n  Plaintiff Harriet Lowell resides in White Plains, New York and typically uses a motorized \nscooter to travel.  ECF No. 20 (“Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 12-13.  Plaintiff Westchester Disabled on the \nMove, Inc. (“WDOMI”) is a non-profit organization based in Yonkers, New York that operates \nas an independent living center for, and is run largely by, individuals with disabilities.  Id. ¶¶ 18-\n19.  Among other things, WDOMI’s mission “is to empower people with disabilities to control \ntheir own lives, advocate for civil rights and a society free of barriers to people with disabilities,” \nand “ensure[ ] that people with mobility disabilities are able to effectively use the transportation \nservices they require.”  Id. ¶¶ 20-21. \nLyft is a ridesharing transportation company that offers services through a ride-hailing \napplication (“app”).  Id. ¶¶ 24, 32.  By using the app, a customer “can remotely hail a nearby \nLyft vehicle, select a destination to which he or she wishes to be driven, and have all payments \nfor this conveyance electronically processed.”  Id. ¶ 33.  Plaintiffs allege that Lyft discriminates \nagainst individuals with mobility disabilities.  They allege that “[i]n Westchester County and \nmany other cities and regions where Lyft provides its transportation service, Lyft does not make \n[WAVs] available at all.”  Id. ¶ 46.  As an initial step, individuals with mobility disabilities \n“must toggle on the ‘Access Mode’ function in the Lyft smartphone [app] to attempt to be \n \n3 “When considering a motion for class certification, courts accept the allegations in the \ncomplaint as true.  And a court may consider material outside the pleadings in determining the \nappropriateness of class certification.”  Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., Inc. v. SUNY Purchase, \n331 F.R.D. 279, 284 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“WILC”) (quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, the \nfacts set forth here are taken from Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint (ECF No. 20) and evidence \nsubmitted by both parties in connection with this motion. \n2 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 3 of 49\nmatched with a [WAV].”  Id. ¶ 47.  Even then, however, “[i]n the numerous cities and regions \nwhere Lyft does not make any [WAVs] available, including Westchester County”—areas that \nPlaintiffs refer to in their motion papers as the “Non-Access Regions”—“customers with Access \nMode enabled who attempt to use the Lyft smartphone [app] to hail a ride are simply sent a text \nmessage with information on other transportation services in the area.”  Id. ¶ 48.  Indeed, in over \n96 percent of Lyft’s service regions, Lyft precludes WAV service “on both the driver- and rider-\nside.”  ECF No. 285 (“Frei-Pearson Decl.”) Ex. 11 (“Pls.’ Expert Report”) at 29.  “Drivers in \nnon-Access Regions are prevented from identifying as WAVs on Lyft’s app, and riders do not \nhave the option of selecting a WAV ride in non-Access Regions.”  Id. at 29.  This “categorical \npreclusion” means that “even when a Lyft WAV driver is available, . . . the vehicle would not be \nable to identify as such on the platform, nor would a user requiring a WAV be able to request a \nride from that WAV driver.”  Id. at 29-30.  In areas where some number of WAVs are available \nfor hailing through the Lyft app—areas that Plaintiffs refer to in their motion papers as the \n“Access Regions”—users with mobility disabilities who toggle to the Access Mode function in \nthe app can be matched with a WAV, but they allegedly experience “significantly longer wait \ntimes” than users seeking rides in other types of vehicles.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 47, 49.  \nLowell was “aware of the ongoing discrimination by Lyft against people with disabilities \nbecause she has heard from friends and acquaintances who have mobility disabilities and have \nwitnessed Lyft’s failure to provide equivalent, non-discriminatory service.”  Id. ¶ 100; see ECF \nNo. 290 (“Lowell Decl.”) ¶ 8 (“I have been informed of Lyft’s widespread discriminatory \npractices directly from other mobility-impaired individuals who have personally experienced \ndiscrimination.”).  A friend from White Plains told Lowell that he tried to order an accessible \nLyft, was informed that none were available, and received a text message from Lyft telling him \n3 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 4 of 49\nto obtain alternate methods of transit.  Am. Compl. ¶ 100.  Plaintiffs allege that “[b]ecause Lyft \ndoes not provide equal service to people with disabilities who need [WAVs], such as Plaintiff \nLowell, she has been deterred from trying to access Lyft’s transportation services, knowing that \nthe attempt would be futile.”  Id. ¶ 101.   \n  Constituents of WDOMI were also aware of Lyft’s failure to provide WAV service \nthrough their disability rights advocacy and contact with other disability rights advocates in the \ncommunity, as well as via news articles and WDOMI “Action Alerts.”  ECF No. 287 (“Non-\nPublic Frei-Pearson Decl.”) Ex. 2 at 2-10 (Declarations of Ed Sperling, Jesse Sahagun, and John \nStrothenke).4  They all assert that they have been deterred from trying to use Lyft’s \ntransportation services because they knew that it would be futile for them to attempt to do so.  Id. \nPlaintiffs allege that Lyft’s conduct violates Title III of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12184; the New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”), N.Y. \nExec. Law §§ 290-97; and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”), N.Y. City \nAdmin. Code §§ 8-101-31. \n  At the time the Amended Complaint was filed, Lowell and WDOMI sought to serve as \nclass representatives of three putative classes—a nationwide class of “all residents in and visitors \nto all cities and regions serviced by [Lyft] with mobility disabilities who have been and are \ncurrently being discriminated against by [Lyft’s] actions and omissions as alleged,” Am. Compl. \n¶ 113; a “New York State Subclass” of “all residents in and visitors to all cities and regions \nlocated in New York State serviced by [Lyft] with mobility disabilities who have been and are \ncurrently being discriminated against by [Lyft’s] actions and omissions as alleged,” id. ¶ 114; \n \n4 Although the Sperling, Sahagun, and Strothenke declarations were filed entirely under \nseal as part of Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, these particular declarations already have \nbeen filed on the public docket.  See ECF Nos. 35, 37, and 38. \n4 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 5 of 49\nand a “New York City Subclass” of “all residents in and visitors to New York City with mobility \ndisabilities who have been and are currently being discriminated against by [Lyft’s] actions and \nomissions as alleged,” id. ¶ 115.  Over the course of the litigation, Plaintiffs have come to \nidentify what they describe as “three regional variations” in how Lyft offers, or does not offer, \nWAV service: (1) the Non-Access Regions, which encompass over 96 percent of the regions \nwhere Lyft operates and where Lyft allegedly does not offer WAV service at all; (2) the Access \nRegions other than New York City, which include eight metropolitan regions where local \nregulations require or incentivize Lyft to provide some WAV service, but where service to those \nwith mobility disabilities allegedly is still deficient; and (3) New York City (“NYC”), where \nlocal regulations have required Lyft to make many of the alterations that Plaintiffs seek in the \nother Access Regions, but where those with mobility disabilities allegedly still cannot get equal \nservice from Lyft.  See ECF No. 338 (“Pl.’s Revised Mem.”) at 2-3. \n  Consequently, as part of the motion for class certification, and without further amending \nthe complaint, Plaintiffs seek to add two new class representatives, Pauline Scudieri and Kenneth \nBurr, and refine the definitions of the putative classes.  At this point, Plaintiffs seek certification \nof five separate classes, with Lowell and WDOMI as the class representatives for three of the \nclasses, and Scudieri and Burr each as the representative for one of the other two classes.  \nPlaintiffs’ proposed classes are defined as follows:  \n•  All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft, \naside from Lyft’s Access Regions or NYC, who require WAVs for \nvehicular transportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \ntransportation services (the “Non-Access Region Class,” which is \nrepresented by Lowell and WDOMI and asserts claims under the \nADA); \n \n•  All residents of or visitors to the Access Regions—Boston, Chicago, \nDallas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, or San \nFrancisco—who require WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who \n5 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 6 of 49\nare denied equal access to Lyft’s transportation services (the “Access \nRegions Other Than NYC Class,” which is represented by Scudieri \nand asserts claims under the ADA); \n \n•  All residents of or visitors to NYC who require WAVs for vehicular \ntransportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \ntransportation services (the “NYC Class,” which is represented by \nBurr and asserts claims under the ADA, the NYSHRL, and the \nNYCHRL); \n \n•  All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft in \nNew York State aside from NYC who require WAVs for vehicular \ntransportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \ntransportation services (the “New York State Other Than NYC Class,” \nwhich is represented by Lowell and WDOMI and asserts claims under \nthe ADA and NYSHRL); and  \n \n•  All residents of or visitors to Westchester County who require WAVs \nfor vehicular transportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \ntransportation services (the “Westchester Class,” which is represented \nby Lowell and WDOMI and asserts claims under the ADA and \nNYSHRL). \n \nPl.’s Revised Mem. at 3.5  The proposed class definitions exclude (i) people who have \ndownloaded the Lyft app; (ii) people who have brought separate litigation against Lyft for its \nfailure to serve people with disabilities; and (iii) residents of Ohio State University and the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin who do not leave those campuses.  Id. at 3-4.6   \n \n5 In a passing mention on the final page of their 55-page moving brief, Plaintiffs assert \nthat should the Court determine that Scudieri and/or Burr are not proper class representatives, \nthen Lowell and WDOMI have standing to represent all five classes.  Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 55; \nsee also ECF No. 298 (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 8-11.  At best, this argument is presented as an \nafterthought—indeed, it is noteworthy that Plaintiffs’ own summary of the putative classes and \nclass representatives, which is reproduced here, does not refer to Lowell or WDOMI as class \nrepresentatives for the Access Regions Other Than NYC Class or the NYC Class.  Issues of \nstanding for all of the proposed class representatives are addressed in Section I, infra. \n \n  6 People who have downloaded the Lyft app are excluded from all class definitions \nbecause when users download the app, they must accept Lyft’s terms of service, which require \nthem to submit any disputes with Lyft to arbitration and to forego participation in any class \naction litigation.  See ECF No. 295-3 (“Yasay Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-5, 9 & Ex. A.  With respect to the \nuniversity campuses, Plaintiffs explain that while the head of Lyft’s National WAV team \n6 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 7 of 49\nDISCUSSION \nI.  Standing \nAs an initial matter, Lyft contends that it is not necessary to reach the question of class \ncertification pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because named \nPlaintiffs Lowell and WDOMI, as well as newly-named class representatives Scudieri and Burr, \nlack standing, and the class definitions include individuals who lack standing.  Def.’s Opp. at 22-\n38.  Lyft therefore maintains that the matter should be dismissed because the Court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ claims.  See SM Kids, LLC v. Google LLC, 963 F.3d \n206, 211 (2d Cir. 2020) (“Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution limits the subject-matter \njurisdiction of the federal courts to ‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies.’  The standing doctrine, which \nemerges from Article III, is designed ‘to ensure that federal courts do not exceed their authority \nas it has been traditionally understood.’”) (citation omitted) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 \nU.S. 330, 338 (2016)).  This is the second time that the Court has been called upon to address the \nissue of standing.  Lyft previously moved to dismiss the action on this basis, and that motion was \ndenied in a decision issued by the Honorable Nelson S. Román.  Lowell v. Lyft, Inc., 352 F. \nSupp. 3d 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); ECF No. 49.  Judge Román determined that at the motion to \ndismiss stage of the litigation, the Amended Complaint contained sufficient allegations to \n \ntestified that Lyft provides WAV services on these two university campuses, Plaintiffs do not \nhave sufficient information about such services to know whether or how individuals in those \nareas would fit within the proposed class structures in this action.  As a result, individuals who \nare residents of these two university campuses and who do not leave those campuses are \nexcluded from the classes.  Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 4 n.4.  Plaintiffs do not specify why people \nwho have filed other lawsuits are excluded from all of the classes, but the Court sees no reason to \ndisturb Plaintiffs’ additional self-imposed limitation. \n7 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 8 of 49\nestablish Lowell’s standing, and that the allegations were adequate for WDOMI to satisfy the \nelements for associational standing to pursue its ADA claim.7  Id. at 256-59. \n  “It is . . . important not to collapse the standing inquiry into the class certification inquiry.  \nCourts in this District have long made clear that the Article III standing determination should \nprecede that of class certification.”  Fort Worth Emps.’ Ret. Fund v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., \n862 F. Supp. 2d 322, 333 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quotation marks omitted); see Hyland v. Navient \nCorp., 48 F.4th 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2022) (“Before considering whether the District Court properly \ncertified the class under Rule 23(b)(2), we address the threshold issue of standing.”), petition for \ncert. filed sub nom. Yeatman v. Hyland (U.S. Dec. 20, 2022) (No. 22-566).  Therefore, the Court \nmust first address standing before considering whether the proposed classes satisfy the \nrequirements of Rule 23. \n  A.  Legal Standards \n  “[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.”  Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  First, the plaintiff “must have suffered an \n‘injury in fact’—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Id. (cleaned up).  \nSecond, “there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—\nthe injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of \nthe independent action of some third party not before the court.”  Id. (cleaned up).  Third, “it \nmust be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \n \n7 Judge Román determined, however, that WDOMI “cannot satisfy all of the elements for \norganizational standing and cannot satisfy all of the elements for associational standing \nspecifically for its NYCHRL and NYSHRL claims.”  Lowell, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 259. \n8 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 9 of 49\ndecision.”  Id. at 561 (cleaned up).  In the class action context, “[s]tanding is satisfied so long as \nat least one named plaintiff can demonstrate the requisite injury.”  Hyland, 48 F.4th at 117.   \n  “Although the Article III standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking \njurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed, the standing issue may \nbe raised by a party, or by a court on its own initiative, at any stage in the litigation, even after \ntrial and the entry of judgment.”  Carter v. HealthPort Techs., LLC, 822 F.3d 47, 56 (2d Cir. \n2016) (cleaned up).  “At each such stage, the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden \nof establishing the elements of Article III standing; but the stage at which, and the manner in \nwhich, the issue is raised affect (a) the obligation of the plaintiff to respond, (b) the manner in \nwhich the district court considers the challenge, and (c) the standard of review applicable to the \ndistrict court’s decision.”  Id. (cleaned up).  Each element of Article III standing “must be \nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, \ni.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  \nId.  “Thus, the showing that must be made in order to withstand a dismissal for lack of standing \nincreases as the suit proceeds.”  Id.   \nHad this standing challenge been raised in the context of a motion for summary \njudgment, the standard for the Court to apply would have been clear—at the summary judgment \nstage, “the plaintiff can no longer rest on . . . mere allegations, but must set forth by affidavit or \nother evidence specific facts, which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken \nto be true.”  Id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561) (cleaned up).  The present posture is more \nambiguous—discovery is complete, the present motion for class certification has been filed, and \ntrial has not yet commenced, but neither party has filed a motion for summary judgment.  \nHelpfully, both parties have proceeded as though a summary judgment-type standard for \n9 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 10 of 49\nevaluating standing should apply, with Plaintiffs relying on multiple affidavits in support of their \nstanding arguments.  On balance, this approach is appropriate, particularly inasmuch as the issue \nof standing already was considered at the motion to dismiss stage.  Accordingly, the Court will \nlook beyond the pleadings in its assessment of standing in connection with this class certification \nmotion, and will require that Plaintiffs set forth evidence—and not mere allegations—in support \nof standing.   \n  B.  Lowell’s Standing \n    1.  Injury in Fact—Non-Access Regions \n“Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against the disabled in the full and equal \nenjoyment of public accommodations, 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a), and public transportation services, \n§ 12184(a).”  Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., 545 U.S. 119, 128 (2005).  Under the terms \nof the ADA, injunctive relief is available “to any person who is being subjected to discrimination \non the basis of disability in violation of [Title III].”  42 U.S.C. §§ 12188(a)(1)-(2).  To \ndemonstrate injury in fact, a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief must ordinarily “establish a real \nand immediate threat” of having his or her rights violated in the future.  City of Los Angeles v. \nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983); accord Kreisler v. Second Ave. Diner Corp., 731 F.3d 184, 187 \n(2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam).  But in the context of the ADA, if a plaintiff knows that accessibility \nbarriers exist, the plaintiff need not establish that he or she would have otherwise actually or \nimminently visited and/or patronized a place with such barriers, because the ADA does not \n“require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice \nthat a person or organization covered by [Title III of the ADA] does not intend to comply with its \nprovisions.”  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1); Lowell, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 255; see also Int’l Brotherhood \nof Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 363, 365-66 (1977) (establishing the futile gesture \n10 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 11 of 49\ndoctrine in the context of Title VII).  Thus, “to have standing to sue under Title III of the ADA, a \nplaintiff must simply allege that he or she has become aware of discriminatory conditions \nexisting at a public accommodation, and is thereby deterred from visiting or patronizing that \naccommodation.”  Equal Rts. Ctr. v. Uber Techs., Inc., 525 F. Supp. 3d 62, 76 (D.D.C. 2021) \n(cleaned up). \n  Lowell has satisfied this requirement with respect to her claims regarding the availability \nof WAV service via the Lyft app in the Non-Access Regions, where the Lyft app completely \nprohibits users from requesting rides in WAVs.  Judge Román determined that requiring Lowell \nto download the Lyft app to attempt to procure WAV service would amount to a futile gesture, \nbecause Lowell sufficiently alleged that she had actual knowledge that it would not be possible \nto obtain a ride on a WAV using the Lyft app in areas where Lyft provides users with no ability \nwhatsoever to access WAV service.  See Lowell, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 256.  And multiple courts \nhave concluded, in cases involving ADA claims against Uber—a direct competitor of Lyft’s in \nthe ride-hailing app business—“that knowledge of the inaccessibility of Uber’s service is \nsufficient to demonstrate injury under the ADA, regardless of whether the plaintiff has actually \ndownloaded the Uber app.”  Equal Rts. Ctr., 525 F. Supp. 3d at 76 (collecting cases); see also id. \n(reaching the same conclusion); Namisnak v. Uber Techs., Inc., 971 F.3d 1088, 1093 (9th Cir. \n2020) (plaintiffs did not have to download and use the Uber app in order to establish standing \nwhere Uber did not offer WAV service in the geographic region in question (the city of New \nOrleans)); Ramos v. Uber Techs., Inc., No. SA-14-CA-502-XR, 2015 WL 758087, at *7 (W.D. \nTex. Feb. 20, 2015) (“Just like a plaintiff who uses a wheelchair need not engage in the ‘futile \ngesture’ of attempting to enter an inaccessible building, an ADA plaintiff need not request \nservices as long as they have actual notice that they would be denied services or treated in a \n11 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 12 of 49\ndiscriminatory manner and they are being deterred from attempting to obtain the services by such \nknowledge.”).  This Court agrees.  Lowell need not have downloaded and used the Lyft app in \norder to demonstrate an actual injury for her claims regarding the Non-Access Regions—Lowell \nhas demonstrated actual knowledge of the unavailability of WAV service through the Lyft app in \nthose areas, and downloading the Lyft app merely to confirm this lack of access would have been \na futile gesture.8   \nIn connection with the motion for class certification, Lowell submitted a declaration that \naddresses her actual knowledge regarding the unavailability of WAVs via the Lyft app in the \nNon-Access Regions.  Specifically, Lowell states that she has “known for a long time that Lyft \ndoes not provide services for mobility-impaired individuals who require wheelchairs or \nmotorized scooters,” and that she has “been informed of Lyft’s widespread discriminatory \npractices directly from other mobility-impaired individuals who have personally experienced \ndiscrimination.”  Lowell Decl. ¶ 8.  Lowell asserts that “it is common knowledge among people \nwith disabilities that Lyft does not offer wheelchair-accessible vehicles in the vast majority of the \ncountry, . . . .”  Id. ¶ 9.  According to Lowell, she has “attended multiple public meetings where \npeople with disabilities and advocates discussed Lyft’s failure to offer wheelchair-accessible \nvehicles”; further, she “assisted the city of White Plains in its efforts to ensure that taxicabs in \nWhite Plains are accessible,” and “[a]s part of that process, [she] spoke to numerous other \n \n  8 A rule that would require an individual to download the app in order to establish \nstanding for an ADA violation would amount to a Catch-22, because to download the app, the \nuser would have to accept Lyft’s terms of service, which require the user to relinquish his or her \nright to litigate any potential ADA claim in court.  See footnote 6, supra; Yasay Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9 & \nEx. A.  “This set of circumstances not only makes little practical sense, but it is also manifestly \ninconsistent with Congress’s express intent to allow plaintiffs to challenge public \naccommodations that are not in compliance with the ADA even if such plaintiffs did not \npersonally encounter the discriminatory barriers themselves.”  Equal Rts. Ctr., 525 F. Supp. 3d at \n79 n.7 (emphasis in original) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1)). \n12 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 13 of 49\nmobility-impaired individuals concerning their experiences.”  Id.  Lowell specifically added that \nshe “particularly remember[s] hearing from a young wheelchair user in White Plains who \nrecounted his embarrassment when his friends were able to take Lyft home at the end of the \nnight out and he had to wait until his mother arrived to pick him up in her wheelchair-accessible \nvehicle.”  Id. ¶ 12; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 100.  This evidence is sufficient to establish Lowell’s \nactual knowledge of the unavailability of WAV vehicles via the Lyft app in those areas where \nthe app prohibits users from hailing WAV vehicles.  Establishing actual knowledge of \naccessibility barriers may be more nuanced and complicated in situations where the allegation is \nthat some level of service is provided but that service is not adequate.  But in the context of the \nNon-Access Regions, where WAV services are completely unavailable—or, analogously, where \na building is completely inaccessible to individuals who require a wheelchair—establishing \nactual knowledge of the barriers to access is more straightforward.  Through the evidence \nsubmitted in her declaration, Lowell has satisfied her obligation to show actual knowledge of \naccess barriers with respect to unavailability of WAV service via the Lyft app in the Non-Access \nRegions. \n  Lyft contends that Lowell has not suffered an injury in fact as to all Non-Access Regions \noutside of her home in White Plains “because she has not raised a reasonable inference that she \nintends to visit those locations.”  Def.’s Opp. at 26.  This Court rejects this challenge to the scope \nof Lowell’s standing.  In Hernandez v. AutoZone, Inc., 323 F.R.D. 496 (E.D.N.Y. 2018), the \nplaintiff filed a putative class action claiming ADA violations at AutoZone stores nationwide due \nto “centralized maintenance policies” that were “inadequate to detect and remedy accessibility \nbarriers in [AutoZone’s] parking lots and walkways.”  Id. at 498.  There, the court rejected the \ndefendant’s argument that the plaintiff “lack[ed] standing because he has visited only the \n13 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 14 of 49\nBrooklyn AutoZone store and not the other AutoZone locations mentioned in his Complaint.”  \nId. at 501.  As the court explained,  \nThis argument confuses class standing with individual standing.  “In a \nputative class action, a plaintiff has class standing if he [or she] plausibly \nalleges (1) that he [or she] personally has suffered some actual injury as a \nresult of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant, and (2) that such \nconduct implicates the same set of concerns as the conduct alleged to have \ncaused injury to other members of the putative class by the same \ndefendants.”  A named plaintiff does not require individual standing to \nbring each class member’s claim in order to establish class standing. \n \nId. at 501 (cleaned up) (quoting NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund v. Goldman Sachs & Co., \n693 F.3d 145, 162 (2d Cir. 2012)).  The court in Hernandez held that the plaintiff had class \nstanding because (1) “he has faced access barriers as a result of AutoZone’s alleged failure to \ndetect and remedy them”; and (2) “access barriers encountered by other class members at other \nAutoZone locations implicate the same set of concerns as the ones Hernandez encountered: \nwhether AutoZone’s centralized policies are adequate to detect and remedy violations of the \nADA.”  Id. (cleaned up). \n  Similarly, here, the question is not whether Lowell intends to travel to other Non-Access \nRegions around the country where she would want to—and not be able to—use the Lyft app to \nrequest a WAV, i.e., where she would have to engage in the same “futile gesture” of trying to get \nWAV service through the Lyft app.  Rather, the question is whether the “access barriers \nencountered by other class members” in other Non-Access Regions “implicate the same set of \nconcerns” as the access barriers encountered by Lowell in Westchester County, New York—\nnamely, that WAV service is not provided by Lyft at all.  The evidence put forward by Plaintiffs \nat this stage demonstrates that Lowell has met this burden, because throughout the Non-Access \nRegions, the Lyft app has the exact same restrictions with respect to WAV service.  Pls.’ Expert \nReport at 29-30.   \n14 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 15 of 49\n  Lyft also argues that “even as to her home in White Plains or Westchester County, \nLowell does not have standing because her ‘some day’ intentions to use the Lyft app are \ninsufficient to establish ‘actual or imminent injury’ necessary for injunctive relief.”  Def.’s Opp. \nat 27 (citing Harty v. W. Point Realty Inc., 28 F.4th 435 (2d Cir. 2022) and Calcano v. Swarovski \nN. Am. Ltd., 36 F.4th 68 (2d Cir. 2022)).  But the case law cited by Lyft is inapposite.  In Harty, \nthe disabled plaintiff asserted claims for damages based on the alleged failure of a hotel website \nto comply with the ADA, which he alleged infringed on his right to travel free from \ndiscrimination.  The panel decision explained that the plaintiff, who nowhere alleged in his \ncomplaint that he was using the hotel’s website to arrange for future travel, lacked standing to \nbring a lawsuit seeking damages.  28 F.4th at 443.  Notably, the Harty court did not discuss the \napplicably of the futile gesture doctrine to the standing analysis regarding the use of this website.  \nAnd in any event, as addressed further below, Lowell’s affidavit explains that she would use Lyft \nfor transportation if the app made it possible for her to access WAVs in Westchester County.  It \nis difficult to see how Lowell could do more than this to demonstrate that she would make use of \nLyft’s services if the known barriers to access that currently deter her from attempting to use the \nLyft app were to be removed.   \n  In Calcano, visually impaired plaintiffs asserted claims for injunctive relief under the \nADA based on the failure of certain retail stores to offer Braille gift cards.  In deciding that the \nplaintiffs lacked standing, the Second Circuit relied on the plaintiffs’ failure to plausibly allege \nan intent to return to the retail stores in question as fatal to their ability to demonstrate that they \nhad suffered an injury in fact.  36 F.4th at 75-76.  Calcano focuses on whether the plaintiffs \ndemonstrated an “intent to return” to a physical location, but again does not substantively \naddress how the futile gesture doctrine impacts the standing analysis.  See 36 F.4th at 74 n.4 \n15 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 16 of 49\n(majority opinion noted without further discussion that “deterrence constitutes an injury under \nthe ADA” and that the ADA’s remedy provision does not require a person to engage in a futile \ngesture, quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1)); id. at 80 (concurring opinion noted that the majority \n“seems to agree” with Congress’s recognition in the ADA that people with disabilities should not \nbe required to engage in futile gestures, but “its reasoning today suggests otherwise”).  It would \nbe incongruous to hold here that Plaintiffs were somehow required to evidence an “intent to \nreturn” to the Lyft app prior to the removal of access barriers after having demonstrated that they \nknew it would be a futile gesture to use the app in the Non-Access Regions to attempt to arrange \nfor WAV transportation.  As for Lowell’s intentions if such barriers were to be removed, she has \nmade sufficiently clear that she would use Lyft’s services. \n  In this case, since it would have been a “futile gesture” for Lowell to have downloaded \nand tried to use the Lyft app in the first instance, it is manifest that she never “visited” the app \nand thus could not have an intent to return to it.  Rather, the risk of imminent future harm to \nLowell is based on the continued lack of WAV service available on Lyft’s app in the Non-\nAccess Regions and that any attempt to download and use the app remains a futile gesture.  \nMoreover, Lowell has expressed an intention to use the Lyft app once it offers WAV service in \nWestchester County.  See, e.g., Lowell Decl. ¶¶ 10 (“I would use Lyft for transportation in \nWestchester County but cannot do so as Lyft does not offer WAV service in Westchester \nCounty.”); 15 (“I would like to travel to New York City more often but, unfortunately, I am \nlimited by inadequate transportation options because Westchester County’s ParaTransit service \ndoes not extend to New York City, public transportation options between Westchester and New \nYork City are largely inaccessible, and private taxicabs are significantly more expensive than \n16 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 17 of 49\nLyft.”); 23 (“If Lyft were ADA-compliant and provided reliable access to me and my motorized \nscooter, I would be eager to use its services.”). \nFor all of these reasons, Lowell has established that she has suffered an injury in fact \nsufficient to satisfy the first element of standing as to her claims regarding the Non-Access \nRegions.   \n    2.  Injury in Fact—Access Regions \n  To the extent Plaintiffs contend that Lowell has standing to pursue claims regarding the \nAccess Regions, including NYC, they have failed to demonstrate that Lowell has standing as to \nthese claims.  Plaintiffs have offered scant arguments in support of this proposition in their \nextensive briefing, see footnote 5, supra, and notably, even in Lowell’s own declaration in \nsupport of Plaintiffs’ class certification motion, she does not request to serve as a class \nrepresentative for the Access Regions or NYC classes, see Lowell Decl. ¶¶ 25, 30.  Ultimately, \nthe Hernandez analysis makes clear that Lowell does not have class standing for purposes of the \nAccess Regions and NYC.  Lowell has come forward with sufficient evidence of her knowledge \nof access barriers in areas like her hometown of White Plains, where the Lyft app does not allow \nfor any access whatsoever to WAV vehicles.  In contrast, the only statement she makes regarding \naccess barriers in any of the Access Regions is that “it is common knowledge among people with \ndisabilities that Lyft . . . provides insufficient and unequal accessible services in the few regions \nwhere it does offer WAVs.”  Id. ¶ 9.  This conclusory assertion is not enough—it does not \nsuggest that Lowell has any particular knowledge about the specific access barriers in any of the \nAccess Regions where at least some level of WAV service is available through the Lyft app.   \n  It is clear from the parties’ submissions that the barriers allegedly encountered by \npotential members of the Access Regions and NYC classes do not implicate the same set of \n17 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 18 of 49\nconcerns as those about which Lowell has knowledge.  See Hernandez, 323 F.R.D. at 501.  \nRather, Lyft app users in the Access Regions allegedly have other challenges—such as knowing \nhow to activate Access Mode in the app, see Pls.’ Expert Report at 43-45—and there is nothing \nin Lowell’s affidavit or anywhere else in the record to indicate that Lowell has personal \nexperience or knowledge gained from others about the access barriers that distinctly apply in the \nAccess Regions or in NYC.  Moreover, despite Plaintiffs’ contention that Lowell has standing to \nrepresent the Access Regions and NYC because standing is assessed as of the time the action \nwas filed, when Lyft “did not offer WAVs in many of the Access Regions . . . and Lyft’s WAV \nservice in NYC . . . [was] but a shadow of its current service,” see Pls.’ Reply at 8, Lowell still \nhas to demonstrate that she has actual knowledge of the deficiencies in Lyft’s WAV service that \nshe is challenging with respect to the Access Regions and NYC in order to establish her standing \nto represent those classes.  Because Lowell has failed to show the requisite actual knowledge, \nshe cannot satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement for standing to represent the Access Regions \nand NYC classes.  \n    3.  Traceability and Redressability \n  Lowell satisfies the traceability requirement for standing—there can be no genuine \ndispute that the alleged injury of not being able to access WAVs via the Lyft app in the Non-\nAccess Regions is caused by Lyft’s decisions as to how to design and deploy the app.  Indeed, \nprudently, Lyft does not attempt argue that Lowell cannot satisfy the traceability requirement. \n  Lyft does, however, maintain that Lowell lacks standing because she “cannot show that \nher injury is redressable anywhere, including in White Plains, New York.”  Def.’s Opp. at 27-28.  \nThis argument is unavailing.  To satisfy the element of redressability, “it must be likely, as \nopposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan, \n18 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 19 of 49\n504 U.S. at 561 (quotation marks omitted).  At least certain elements of the injunctive relief that \nPlaintiffs seek—for example, removing the categorical block of WAVs on the Lyft platform in \nthe Non-Access Regions to enable users to access WAVs via the app, see Pls.’ Expert Report at \n6, 66-67—would be redressed if there were to be a favorable decision in this litigation as to that \nissue.  See Namisnak, 971 F.3d at 1094 (“Uber drivers cannot offer uberWAV services without \nUber first making that option available . . . [a]nd an injunction would redress that injury by \nrequiring Uber to offer access to its services.”).  Whether such relief is required by law is the \nmerits question in this lawsuit, but the redressability element of standing does not require \nPlaintiffs to demonstrate that they will succeed on the merits.  See Civ. Rts. Educ. & Enf’t Ctr. v. \nHosp. Props. Tr., 867 F.3d 1093, 1102 (9th Cir. 2017) (“The Named Plaintiffs have requested \nthat the court fashion an injunction mandating that the HPT hotels comply with the ADA.  If the \nNamed Plaintiffs were to prevail and receive their requested relief, then their injuries would be \nredressed.  They have therefore satisfied the redressability requirement, whether or not they are \ncorrect on the merits.”).  Accordingly, Lowell has satisfied the redressability requirement as to \nher claims regarding the Non-Access Regions. \n* * * * * * * * * * \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have established that Lowell has standing to pursue claims regarding \nthe Non-Access Regions, but Plaintiffs have failed to establish that Lowell has standing to \npursue claims regarding any of the Access Regions, including NYC.   \n  C.  WDOMI’s Standing \nJudge Román previously found that WDOMI had alleged facts sufficient to support \nassociational standing to pursue its ADA claim, Lowell, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 256-59; at this stage, \nLyft again argues that WDOMI lacks associational standing.  “An organization has associational \n19 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 20 of 49\nstanding if it can show that (1) its members would have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the \ninterests it seeks to protect relate to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the asserted claim \nnor the requested relief require the participation of individual members of the lawsuit.”  Hunt v. \nWash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).    \n  Lyft contends that WDOMI fails to satisfy the first element of associational standing \nbecause it lacks both members and indicia of membership.  Def.’s Opp. at 28-29.  “Where an \nassociation is not a traditional voluntary membership organization, its constituents must \nnevertheless possess sufficient ‘indicia of membership.’”  Mental Hygiene Legal Serv. v. Cuomo, \n609 F. App’x 693, 695 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order) (quoting Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344).  While \nPlaintiffs concede that WDOMI is not a traditional voluntary membership organization, there are \nnumerous examples of courts finding that independent living centers such as WDOMI have \nassociational standing to represent people with disabilities.  In Bronx Independent Living \nServices v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority, No. 16-cv-5023 (ER), 2021 WL 1177740 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2021), the court determined that “an independent living center that provides \nservices and advocacy for persons with disabilities [where] disabled individuals make up more \nthan half of its leadership and staff” had associational standing.  Id. at *12.  In WILC, the court \nfound associational standing for an organization where 80 percent of the board members and 65 \npercent of the staff of the independent living center in question had a disability, i.e., it was \n“staffed, directed, and driven by the individuals with disabilities that it seeks to serve.”  331 \nF.R.D. at 297.  And in Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled v. Bloomberg, 290 \nF.R.D. 409 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“BCID”), the court decided that the Center for the Independence of \nthe Disabled had associational standing where over half of its board members and over 70 \npercent of its staff were persons with disabilities, i.e., it was “a service provider managed and \n20 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 21 of 49\ndirected by persons with disabilities for the purpose of serving persons with disabilities.”  Id. at \n416-17 (cleaned up).   \n  Here, WDOMI’s by-laws state that it was formed “to promote independence, equality and \ndignity in employment, housing, educational endeavors, social and recreational opportunities, \ntransportation and all other areas of life for persons who have a disability.”  ECF No. 295-25 \n(Jonas Decl. Ex. 20) at 2 (Section 3.1) (emphasis added).  The by-laws also state that “[n]ot less \nthan 51% of the Board shall consist of persons with disabilities.”  Id. at 5 (Section 5.5).  \nAccording to WDOMI’s former Executive Director, Melvyn R. Tanzman, “WDOMI is run and \ngoverned by individuals with disabilities,” and “[a] significant percentage of WDOMI’s \nmembers, staff, and constituents have mobility impairments.  Many of these individuals require \nwheelchairs or motorized scooters to maneuver.”  ECF No. 300-7 (“Tanzman Decl.”) ¶¶ 2-3; see \nalso ECF No. 300-6 (“Tanzman Depo.”) at 67:8-21 (50 percent to 75 percent of WDOMI staff \nwere individuals with disabilities).  Based on the foregoing, this Court concludes that WDOMI \nhas sufficient “indicia of membership” for purposes of associational standing. \n  WDOMI also satisfies the requirement “that some particular member of the organization \nwould have had standing to bring the suit individually.”  N.Y. Civ. Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. \nTransit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 294 (2d Cir. 2012).  Plaintiffs provide the declarations of several \nWDOMI constituents which establish those individuals’ standing to sue in their own right.  See \nNon-Public Frei-Pearson Decl. Ex. 2 at 2-10 (Declarations of Ed Sperling, Jesse Sahagun, and \nJohn Strothenke).  Each of these declarations demonstrates actual knowledge that it would be a \nfutile gesture to download and try to use Lyft’s app in the Non-Access Regions since Lyft fails to \noffer WAV service in those regions.  See Sperling Decl. ¶¶ 7-8 (“I learned of Lyft’s failure to \nprovide [WAVs] by virtue of my own disability rights advocacy and through other advocates in \n21 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 22 of 49\nthe community.  I particularly recall preparing for a trip to Albany, where my fellow advocates \nand I travel[led] to meet with and educate New York State legislators.  Prior to our trip, we \ndiscussed the particular issues that we intended to raise with the legislators, at which time I \nlearned of [sic] that Lyft does not offer [WAVs] in New York or throughout the country.”); \nSahagun Decl. ¶ 7 (“I first learned about Lyft’s lack of wheelchair accessibility when I went on \nthe internet to look for accessible methods of transportation, and came across several news \narticles concerning Lyft’s discrimination against wheelchair users nationwide.  I also spoke to \nWDOMI’s staff about Lyft’s failure to provide accessible services in the region and about the \nlack of accessible vehicles available in general.”); Strothenke Decl. ¶¶ 8-9 (“As a WDOMI \nconstituent, I regularly participate in WDOMI’s work to educate legislators about the need for \nlegislation to require Lyft to be accessible.  I have also read WDOMI’s Action Alerts concerning \nLyft’s inaccessibility.  In conversations with other mobility-impaired friends and advocates, I \nhave heard many unfortunate stories about wheelchair users’ failed attempts to use Lyft’s \nservices.”).   \n  Lyft challenges these declarations as deficient because they predate WDOMI’s deposition \nand the modified class definitions, Def.’s Opp. at 29 n.10, but it is not clear why this should \nmatter, at least with respect to the Non-Access Regions, where Lyft allegedly has consistently \nfailed to provide WAV service throughout the course of the litigation.  As to Plaintiffs’ claims \nregarding the Non-Access Regions, the declarations suffice to establish WDOMI’s standing.   \n  WDOMI also has sufficiently demonstrated that the interests it seeks to protect in this \nlitigation relate to the organization’s purpose.  As noted above, WDOMI’s by-laws state that it \nwas formed, among other reasons, “to promote independence, equality and dignity in . . . \ntransportation . . . for persons who have a disability.”  Jonas Decl. Ex. 20 at 2 (Section 3.1); see \n22 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 23 of 49\nalso Tanzman Decl. ¶ 4 (“WDOMI’s mission is to empower people with disabilities to control \ntheir own lives; advocate for civil rights and a barrier[-]free society; encourage people with \ndisabilities to participate in the political process; educate government, business, and other \nentities, and society as a whole to understand, accept, and accommodate people with disabilities; \nand create an environment that inspires self-respect.”).  The Second Circuit has noted that the \n“germaneness” requirement for standing is not demanding, and that a court need only decide \nwhether the action would “reasonably tend to further the general interests that individual \nmembers sought to vindicate in joining the association and whether the lawsuit bears a \nreasonable connection to the association’s knowledge and experience.”  Bldg. & Constr. Trades \nCouncil of Buffalo v. Downtown Dev., Inc., 448 F.3d 138, 148-49 (2d Cir. 2006).  Although Lyft \nargues that “there is little to no evidence on which this Court could conclude that WDOMI’s \nConsumers care about Access mode on the Lyft app,” Def.’s Opp. at 30, the case law does not \nrequire such a narrow reading of germaneness, Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council of Buffalo, 448 \nF.3d at 149 (“We think it significant that the Hunt Court used the word ‘germane,’ rather than \nthe phrase ‘at the core of,’ or ‘central to,’ or some word or phrase indicating the need for a closer \nnexus between the interests sought to be protected by the suit in question and the organization’s \ndominant purpose.”).  WDOMI’s current Executive Director, Maria Samuels, stated in her \ndeclaration that “[a]s an organization dedicated to independence and equal rights for individuals \nwith disabilities, providing adequate access to transportation services such as Lyft is very \nimportant to WDOMI’s mission.”  ECF No. 291 ¶ 13.  Moreover, Tanzman testified at his \ndeposition that WDOMI’s decision to serve as a Plaintiff in this litigation was “based upon the \nreal-life experiences and complaints of our consumer members.”  Tanzman Depo. at 86:10-17.  \nWDOMI has thus demonstrated that this litigation is germane to its purpose. \n23 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 24 of 49\n  WDOMI also satisfies the third and final requirement for associational standing—that \nneither the asserted claims nor the requested relief require the participation of individual \nmembers of the lawsuit—because “where the organization seeks a purely legal ruling without \nrequesting that the federal court award individualized relief to its members, the Hunt test may be \nsatisfied.”  Bano v. Union Carbide Corp., 361 F.3d 696, 714 (2d Cir. 2004).  Here, WDOMI \nseeks only injunctive relief on a class-wide basis; none of the relief sought would require \nindividualized proof. \n  Finally, Lyft argues—without providing any legal basis for the assertion—that WDOMI \n“does not have standing to represent anyone outside of Westchester County.”  Def.’s Opp. at 30.  \nBut as addressed above in the Court’s analysis of Lowell’s standing, the appropriate question is \nwhether the “access barriers encountered by other class members” throughout the Non-Access \nRegions “implicate the same set of concerns” as those encountered by WDOMI in Westchester \nCounty, namely, that WAV service is not provided by Lyft at all in those regions.  See \nHernandez, 323 F.R.D. at 501.  The fact that WDOMI is a non-profit organization does not \nchange the analysis.  Because the accessibility concerns are the same, WDOMI has established \nthat it has standing to assert class claims seeking injunctive relief in the Non-Access Regions as a \nwhole.   \nAs with Lowell, however, to the extent Plaintiffs contend that WDOMI has standing to \npursue claims regarding the Access Regions, including, NYC, those arguments fail.9  The actual \nknowledge of access barriers articulated in the declarations of certain WDOMI constituents \naddresses their knowledge about areas where the Lyft app does not allow for any WAV access at \n \n9 The references in the briefing to WDOMI’s standing to pursue claims in the Access \nRegions, including NYC, are even more sparse than the limited discussion regarding Lowell’s \npurported standing to pursue such claims.  See Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 55; Pls.’ Reply at 8-11. \n24 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 25 of 49\nall, but does not suggest any actual knowledge about the facts and circumstances of access \nbarriers in any of the Access Regions.10  See Non-Public Frei-Pearson Decl. Ex. 2 at 2-10.  The \naccess barriers encountered by WDOMI in Westchester County do not implicate the same set of \nconcerns as those encountered by putative class members in the Access Regions.  Accordingly, \nWDOMI does not have class standing to pursue claims against Lyft pertaining to the Access \nRegions, including NYC. \n* * * * * * * * * * \nFor all of these reasons, Plaintiffs have established that WDOMI has standing to pursue \nclaims regarding the Non-Access Regions, but Plaintiffs have failed to establish that WDOMI \nhas standing to pursue claims regarding any of the Access Regions, including NYC.11   \nD.  Standing of Proposed Class Representatives  \nPauline Scudieri and Kenneth Burr \n  Plaintiffs propose to have Scudieri serve as the class representative for the “Access \nRegions Other Than NYC Class,” and to have Burr serve as the class representative for the \n“NYC Class.”  Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 3.  Even though neither Scudieri nor Burr has downloaded \nthe Lyft app, Plaintiffs maintain that they each have standing since they knew of deficiencies in \nLyft’s WAV service.  Plaintiffs contend that it would have been a futile gesture for Scudieri and \nBurr to download the Lyft app to explore the extent of service in the relevant Access Regions, \nmuch as it would have been a futile gesture for Lowell to download the app to confirm the total \n \n10 In this context, the fact that the declarations in question were prepared before Plaintiffs \nproposed the revised class definitions is significant, because those declarations did not account \nfor the distinctions among the various potential classes—distinctions that Plaintiffs themselves \nthought were significant enough to merit proposing that the potential classes be separated in this \nfashion. \n  11 WDOMI satisfies the requirements of traceability and redressability for the same \nreasons as Lowell.  See Section I.B.3, supra. \n25 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 26 of 49\nunavailability of WAV service via the Lyft app in the Non-Access Regions.  Pls.’ Reply at 11-\n12.  But an individual can only rely on the futile gesture doctrine if he or she demonstrates actual \nknowledge of the relevant barriers to access, such that there would have been no functional \npurpose served by taking further steps to obtain that knowledge directly.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n12188(a)(1).  Neither Scudieri nor Burr has come forward with sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that they had the requisite degree of knowledge here.   \n  As an initial matter, Lyft asserts that the fact that Scudieri and Burr did not download the \nLyft app to personally assess the degree of WAV service provided through the Lyft app in the \nAccess Regions is determinative of the standing inquiry for these proposed class representatives.  \nSee Access Living of Metro. Chicago v. Uber Techs., Inc., 958 F.3d 604, 614-15 (7th Cir. 2020); \nNamisnak, 971 F.3d at 1093 (drawing a “dispositive distinction” for purposes of the futile \ngesture doctrine between areas where Uber offered some degree of WAV service and areas \nwhere it offered no WAV service at all); but see Equal Rts. Ctr., 525 F. Supp. 3d at 77-79 \n(disagreeing with the Access Living analysis, and concluding that individual demonstrated actual \nknowledge of access barriers regarding UberWAV service in Washington D.C. even though she \nhad not downloaded the Uber app).  This argument presents only an abstract question in this \nlitigation, and the Court need not resolve it for purposes of this motion.  Even if the Court were \nto assume—consistent with the holding in Equal Rights Center—that downloading the Lyft app \nis not necessarily required to establish an injury in fact in an Access Region, it would still be \nnecessary for Scudieri and Burr to show that they had the relevant actual knowledge regarding \naccessibility barriers without having downloaded the app, and they both have failed to \ndemonstrate such actual knowledge regarding the WAV services available through the Lyft app \nin the Access Regions.   \n26 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 27 of 49\n  In Equal Rights Center, the declaration from Equal Rights Center (“ERC”) member Heidi \nCase “attest[ed] to her knowledge of Uber’s inaccessibility based on her ‘active engagement on \naccessibility issues’ in the transportation sector, and the fact that she has had ‘regular \nconversations (at least once a month) with people specifically about the accessibility’ of Uber’s \nservices.”  525 F. Supp. 3d at 75.  Case “aver[red] that, before the instant lawsuit was filed, she \nlearned that ‘ERC’s tests confirmed that accessible taxis hailed through Uber routinely were \nunavailable or took a very long time to arrive (if at all) and that such rides also were more \nexpensive than Uber-branded rides.’”  Id.  Regarding her knowledge of Uber’s WAV service, \n“UberWAV,” Case “aver[red] that she heard from ‘countless friends and contacts’ who had \nattempted to use UberWAV that either no wheelchair accessible vehicles were available or that, \nafter connecting to a driver, they had to wait extended periods of time before the driver \nultimately cancelled or failed to show up”; and “‘[o]n multiple occasions,’ Case was allegedly \npresent while someone attempted to call an UberWAV, which permitted her to ‘witness[ ] first-\nhand [UberWAV’s] inaccessibility’ and to see how the app frequently reflected that no \nUberWAVs were available in the area, or how, ‘even when a connection is made to an \nUberWAV, that car does not reliably respond in [a] timely fashion.’”  Id.      \n  Neither the declarations submitted by Scudieri and Burr in support of the motion for class \ncertification nor their deposition testimony contain anything approaching this level of detail \nabout their knowledge regarding Lyft service in any Access Region.12  In her declaration, \nScudieri, who lives in a suburb of Dallas, Texas, states, in conclusory fashion, that “Lyft refuses \n \n  12 At her deposition, Scudieri was questioned with respect to an earlier declaration that \nshe had signed in December 2021, see ECF No. 300-8 (“Scudieri Depo.”) at 46:18-22 (marking \nthe declaration for identification as Exhibit 59), but that declaration has not been provided to the \nCourt.  \n27 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 28 of 49\nto provide equal access to its transportation services to myself and other individuals with \ndisabilities in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, and San \nFrancisco (collectively, the ‘Access Regions’),” and that “Lyft’s deficient WAV service is well \nknown among members of the disabled community.”  ECF No. 292 (“Scudieri Decl.”) ¶¶ 5-6.  \nAt her deposition, when asked about wheelchair accessible transportation options in Dallas such \nas public transit, paratransit, and taxis, Scudieri testified that she did not know whether any such \noptions were available, adding, “I do not [know] because I have never had a need to – or never \nknew that somebody – that there was a Lyft or another service like that available to me in Dallas.  \nI am not in Dallas proper to have a need like that.”  Scudieri Depo. at 24:5-25:8.  She later added \nthat she had never downloaded the Lyft app and did not know anyone who had, id. at 42:6-10,13 \nand with respect to whether she had ever had a conversation with anyone about their experiences \nwith Lyft, she stated that “in fact it doesn’t come up in conversation, and I very likely have \nchatted with individuals that have used the service, but it just doesn’t come up in conversation.”  \nId. at 80:1-11; see id. at 62:14-63:10 (same); see also id. at 52:6-13 (she does not know anyone \nwho has tried to request a Lyft WAV in Dallas).  Scudieri also testified that “outside of \ncommunications with counsel,” she did not have an independent basis for knowing about the \nservice levels for Lyft’s Access Mode in any of the Access Regions.  Id. at 67:20-69:10.  This \nevidence does not suffice to establish that Scudieri has actual knowledge about WAV service \navailable through the Lyft app in Dallas, or in any of the Access Regions.  See Ramos, 2015 WL \n \n  13 Scudieri also testified that Lyft does not “advertise that they have wheelchair \naccessible vehicles” available through the Lyft app in Dallas.  Scudieri Depo. at 13:12-19.  Even \nthough Lyft’s purported lack of advertising is one of the alleged deficiencies targeted by \nPlaintiffs’ requested relief in connection with both the Non-Access and Access Regions, see Pls.’ \nRevised Mem. at 24, Scudieri’s knowledge about this aspect of Lyft’s operations does not \nestablish any actual knowledge on her part about the degree of WAV service available through \nthe Lyft app in Dallas. \n28 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 29 of 49\n758087, at * 2 (court originally determined that allegations based upon “information and belief” \nwere insufficient to demonstrate actual notice; only upon filing of detailed affidavits by plaintiffs \ndid court conclude that they had actual notice of Uber’s and Lyft’s non-compliance with the \nADA).14 \n  Burr’s declaration in support of the motion for class certification similarly lacks the \nspecificity required to establish that he has actual knowledge of the performance of the Lyft app \nwith respect to WAVs in NYC.  He states in conclusory fashion that “Lyft refuses to provide \nequal access to its transportation services to myself and other individuals with disabilities in New \nYork City and nationwide,” and that “Lyft’s deficient WAV service has been well known among \nmembers of the disabled community, including myself.”  ECF No. 293 (“Burr Decl.”) ¶ 5.  \nWhile he also states that “[o]ver the past several years, I have seen numerous news articles and \nnews reports about Lyft and its inhumane treatment when it comes to not providing accessible \n \n  14 In Ramos, to demonstrate that the futile gesture doctrine should be applied to them, the \nthree plaintiffs, who all required WAVs for transportation, each filed an affidavit to evidence \ntheir actual knowledge of Uber’s and Lyft’s failures to provide WAV services.  Plaintiff Ramos’ \naffidavit stated that he knew that Uber and Lyft “had made the decision to deny service to \nmobility-impaired Texans because their refusal to provide service to the disabled had been \nreported in the news and had been a topic of conversation among mobility-impaired customers \nwho relied on private transportation to go to the doctor or attend to other personal tasks.”  \nRamos, 2015 WL 758087, at *8.  Ramos also attached an article to his affidavit about the lack of \nWAV services and stated that he had “examined the apps used for securing rides, and neither \nprovide[d] a method to identify a mobility-impaired customer or to request an accommodating \nvehicle.”  Id.  Plaintiffs Posadas’ and Williams’ affidavits, which were similar to one another, \nstated that they knew that Uber and Lyft “had made the decision to deny service to mobility-\nimpaired Texans because their refusal to provide service to the disabled had been reported in the \nnews, had been a topic of conversation among mobility-impaired customers who relied on \nprivate transportation, and the issue was discussed ‘in advance of public hearings for the City of \nHouston that was considering an ordinance that would allow Uber and Lyft and companies like \nthem to operate legally.’”  Id.  Like Ramos, they stated that they had “examined the apps used \nand neither provided a method to identify a mobility-impaired customer or to request an \naccommodating vehicle.”  Id.  The court concluded that the plaintiffs had “demonstrated that \nthey had actual notice at the time they filed suit sufficient to invoke the futile gestures doctrine.”  \nId. at *9.  \n29 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 30 of 49\ntransportation to people with disabilities,” id. ¶ 7, Burr provides no detail with respect to any \nspecific deficiencies in the WAV service that Lyft provides in NYC.15  He does no more than \nmake the general conclusory statement that the “WAV service that Lyft provides in New York \nCity is entirely inadequate when compared to its services for able-bodied riders.”  Id. ¶  8.   \n  At his deposition, Burr again stated, “[I]f Lyft were available, because I’ve never \ndownloaded the app, I’ve never used it because I’ve heard . . . from the news articles and the \nnews reports that Lyft in New York City does not provide enough . . .  you know, you have \nWAV service, but it could be better.”  ECF No. 300-9 (“Burr Depo.”) at 18:15-21; see also id. at \n19:20-20:1 (“I currently don’t have access to the app.  I’ve never downloaded it because I have \nheard of, through news reports and articles, the inhumane treatment of disabled customers when \nit comes to people with disabilities.  And so I was – I’ve been highly discouraged from using \nand/or downloading the app.”), 34:21-35:2 (“I saw from various articles that there were a lot of \nnegative experiences, so, you know, I had thought about using Lyft [in NYC] just to see if there \nwas a difference [from Uber], but then after . . . seeing . . . articles – I decided not to.”).  When \nasked whether he had ever spoken with anyone about their experience using Lyft’s Access Mode \nin NYC, Burr testified that he had not.  Id. at 35:16-19.  Burr’s declarations and deposition \ntestimony lack the level of specificity required to demonstrate that he has actual knowledge of \ndeficiencies in Lyft’s WAV service in NYC sufficient to satisfy the futile gesture doctrine and \nestablish standing.   \n* * * * * * * * * * \n \n15 Burr made similar statements in another declaration that he wrote and signed a month \nearlier.  See Non-Public Frei-Pearson Decl. Ex. 2 at 11-14, ¶¶ 6-7. \n30 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 31 of 49\nIn sum, with respect to the Access Regions, including NYC, where Lyft provides some \nlevel of access to WAV service through its app, satisfying the futile gesture doctrine for standing \nrequires proof of actual knowledge of the particular access barriers being challenged in those \nareas.  Because Scudieri and Burr failed to provide such proof, they have failed to establish that \nthey have standing to pursue claims on behalf of the “Access Regions Other Than NYC Class” \nand the “NYC Class,” respectively.  \n  E.  Additional Standing Challenges \n  Lyft argues at length that the case should not be permitted to proceed because at least \nsome of the members of the purported classes, as defined, lack standing.  See Def.’s Opp. at 33-\n38.  But as previously stated, in the class action context, “[s]tanding is satisfied so long as at least \none named plaintiff can demonstrate the requisite injury.”  Hyland, 48 F.4th at 117; see Kendall \nv. Emps. Ret. Plan of Avon Prod., 561 F.3d 112, 118 (2d Cir. 2009) (“In a class action, once \nstanding is established for a named plaintiff, standing is established for the entire class.”); Comer \nv. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 788 (2d Cir. 1994) (in the context of a class action, “only one named \nplaintiff need have standing with respect to each claim”).  Lyft relies on language from Denney \nv. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253 (2d Cir. 2006), for the proposition that “no class may be \ncertified that contains members lacking Article III standing.”  Id. at 264; see Def’s Opp. at 34.  \nThe Second Circuit, however, has recently addressed and rejected this same interpretation of \nDenney: \nSome may interpret a single sentence in Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, \n443 F.3d 253 (2d Cir. 2006), as suggesting that all class members must \nhave standing for the class to proceed.  See id. at 264 (“[N]o class may be \ncertified that contains members lacking Article III standing.”).  But \nDenney was decided before the Supreme Court in [Frank v.] Gaos[, 139 S. \nCt. 1041 (2019)] clarified the minimal requirement for standing in class \nactions.  And, in any event, we acknowledged in Denney that “[o]nce it is \nascertained that there is a named plaintiff with the requisite standing, [ ] \n31 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 32 of 49\nthere is no requirement that the members of the class also proffer such \nevidence.”  Id. at 263-64 (quotation marks omitted); see also 1 Newberg \nand Rubenstein on Class Actions § 2:3 (noting that, “[w]hile [Denney] did \ncontain that sentence, it was embedded in a paragraph that also stated, ... \n[in an explanatory parenthetical] that: ‘[P]assive members need not make \nany individual showing of standing, because the standing issue focuses on \nwhether the plaintiff is properly before the court, not whether represented \nparties or absent class members are properly before the court.’ ”). \n \nHyland, 48 F.4th at 118 n.1.16  There is no requirement that Plaintiffs establish the standing of all \nmembers of each class in order for their proposed classes to be certified.  Lyft’s detailed \narguments concerning the standing of certain putative class members based on their deposition \ntestimony are therefore irrelevant.  \nFinally, Lyft briefly contends that because Plaintiffs’ proposed class definitions expressly \nrefer to individuals who are “denied equal access to Lyft’s transportation services,” the class \ndefinitions are “premised on a legal duty that does not exist,” and therefore no one can have \nstanding to sue Lyft on this ground.  Def.’s Opp. at 33 (citing Noel v. N.Y.C. Taxi & Limousine \nComm’n, 687 F.3d 63, 73 (2d Cir. 2012)).  First, the questions of whether the ADA requires Lyft \nto provide “equal access”—or whether a remedy could be fashioned in favor of Plaintiffs here \nwithout expressly providing “equal access”—are merits issues that are not appropriate for \nresolution at this stage.  To the extent Lyft is suggesting that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the \nredressability requirement for standing because “equal access” is not available as a remedy, this \nCourt rejects that argument because, as set forth in Section I.B.3, supra, Plaintiffs have \nestablished that at least certain aspects of their claims are redressable.  Second, to the extent Lyft \nrelies on the Second Circuit decision in Noel in support of this point, Lyft appears to interpret the \n \n16 To be clear, the parties did not fail to address the Hyland decision in their briefing on \nthis motion—Hyland was issued on September 7, 2022, a short time after the briefing here was \ncompleted on August 26, 2022.   \n32 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 33 of 49\nrelief sought by Plaintiffs too narrowly.  In Noel, the panel noted that “Title III [of the ADA] \nexpressly exempts taxi providers from purchasing or leasing ‘accessible automobiles.’”  687 F.3d \nat 73 (quoting 49 C.F.R. § 37.29(b)).  But Plaintiffs are not demanding that Lyft purchase or \nlease WAVs.  See Pls.’ Reply at 13; Lowell, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 260 (“[A]s Plaintiffs \nacknowledge, the Amended Complaint does not include a specific request that Defendant be \nrequired to provide WAVs but does request that the Defendant be required to ‘develop and \nimplement a remedial plan to ensure full and equal access to its services.’”); see also O’Hanlon \nv. Uber Techs., Inc., No. 19-cv-00675, 2021 WL 2415073, at *8 (W.D. Pa. June 14, 2021) \n(“[T]he inclusion of a particularized exemption balancing competing considerations under the \nADA—i.e., by providing that transportation service enterprises not be statutorily obligated by \nenactment of Title III to purchase or lease new accessible fleet vehicles—cannot reasonably be \nread to negate the over-arching goals and mandate of Section 12184: that a private entity electing \nto primarily engage in the business of transporting people fully include those with disabilities \nand provide reasonable accommodations in furtherance of that objective.”).  In short, the \nproposed class definitions—and the remedies sought by Plaintiffs for Lyft’s allegedly unlawful \npractices—cannot be interpreted as narrowly as Lyft might prefer, and Lyft’s limited argument \nthat the classes lack standing on this basis is unavailing. \n* * * * * * * * * * \nAccordingly, because this Court has determined that Lowell and WDOMI have standing \nas to their claims regarding the Non-Access Regions, the classes they seek to represent—the \nNon-Access Region Class, the New York State Other Than NYC Class, and the Westchester \nClass, all of which consist entirely of Non-Access Regions—have standing, and this Court will \nproceed to consider whether those putative classes should be certified. \n33 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 34 of 49\nBecause this Court has determined that Scudieri, Burr, Lowell, and WDOMI do not have \nstanding as to their claims regarding the Access Regions Other Than NYC Class and the NYC \nClass, there is no standing to pursue claims on behalf of those putative classes, and this Court \ntherefore respectfully recommends that claims as to those putative classes be dismissed. \nII.  Class Certification \n  A.  Legal Standard \n  Certification of a class requires satisfaction of the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Specifically, Plaintiffs must show that “(1) the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 \nU.S. 338, 345 (2011) (quotation marks omitted).  If the Rule 23(a) prerequisites have been \nsatisfied, Plaintiffs must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed class is \n“maintainable” by meeting at least one of the requirements set forth in Rule 23(b) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 287; see Dukes, 564 U.S. at 345.  “Where a \nputative class seeks certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), [Plaintiffs] must show that ‘the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.’”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 287. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)).  “The key to the (b)(2) \nclass is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that \nthe conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class \nmembers or as to none of them.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (quotation marks omitted).  Stated \n34 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 35 of 49\ndifferently, “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would \nprovide relief to each member of the class.”  Id.  “Civil rights cases against parties charged with \nunlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples of what (b)(2) is meant to capture.”  Id. \nat 361 (cleaned up). \n  “The plaintiff carries the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that \neach of the requirements of Rule 23 is met.”  Buffington v. Progressive Advanced Ins. Co., 342 \nF.R.D. 66, 70 (S.D.N.Y. 2022).  “The Court’s determination involves a ‘rigorous analysis,’ to \nensure actual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23.”  Id.  “Such an analysis will frequently \nentail overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim because the class determination \ngenerally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising \nthe plaintiff’s cause of action.”  Id. (cleaned up).  “Merit based inquiries, at the class certification \nstage, however, are permitted only to the extent that they are relevant to determining whether the \nRule 23 prerequisites are satisfied.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted). \nB.  Application of Legal Standard \n  In light of the Court’s standing analysis, the Court considers only the proposed Non-\nAccess Region Class, the proposed New York State Other Than NYC Class, and the proposed \nWestchester Class for certification.   \n  Plaintiffs allege that Lyft is in violation of Title III of the ADA, which prohibits \ndiscrimination “on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of specified public \ntransportation services provided by a private entity that is primarily engaged in the business of \ntransporting people and whose operations affect commerce.”  42 U.S.C. § 12184(a); see Am. \nCompl. ¶ 126.  Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that “[b]y failing to make reasonable modifications to \nits policies, practices, and procedures to make [WAVs] available with equivalent reliability and \n35 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 36 of 49\nsimilar wait times as inaccessible vehicles, Defendant denies users of motorized and other non-\nfolding wheelchairs, including Plaintiff . . . Lowell, WDOMI members, and class members, full \nand equal enjoyment of Defendant’s transportation service in violation of Title III of the ADA.”  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 138; see 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(A) (discrimination includes the failure to “make \nreasonable modifications consistent with those required under section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this \ntitle”17).  In their motion for class certification, Plaintiffs argue that “[w]ithin each class, Lyft’s \ndiscriminatory policies and procedures are identical, and Plaintiffs have proposed uniform and \nreasonable modifications to remedy that discrimination that equally benefit all class members.”  \nPls.’ Revised Mem. at 4.  Each class must separately satisfy the requirements of Rule 23 in order \nto be certified.  \n    1.  The Rule 23(a) Factors \n      a.  Numerosity \n  The numerosity requirement is satisfied if the Court determines that “the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Courts in this \nCircuit presume that this requirement is met when there are 40 or more members of the putative \nclass.  Consol. Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995).  But “where \n \n  17 Section 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) states that discrimination “on the basis of disability in the \nfull and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \naccommodations of any place of public accommodation” includes  \na failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or \nprocedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to \nindividuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making \nsuch modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.   \n42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). \n36 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 37 of 49\nthe putative class seeks injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), as opposed to \nmonetary relief under Rule 23(b)(3)[,] the Second Circuit has relaxed the numerosity \nrequirement.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 288 (cleaned up).  “[A] plaintiff need not establish the \nprecise number of class members so long as the plaintiff reasonably estimates that the number is \nsubstantial, and relies on reasonable inferences drawn from the available facts.”  Wedra v. Cree, \nInc., No. 19-cv-3162 (VB), 2022 WL 2116760, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 2022) (cleaned up); see \nAlexander A. ex rel. Barr v. Novello, 210 F.R.D. 27, 33 (E.D.N.Y. 2002) (“A class action may \nproceed upon estimates as to the size of the proposed class, and courts may make common sense \nassumptions to support a finding of numerosity.” (cleaned up)).   \n  Plaintiffs offer statistical information to support a finding of numerosity as to each of the \nproposed classes.  Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 31-34.  They start with the statistic, taken from U.S. \nCensus Bureau data, that 2.3 percent of adults over the age of 18 use a wheelchair.  Id. at 31 & \nn.68.  Plaintiffs also cite the statistic that approximately 36 percent of American adults have used \na ridesharing service.  Id. at 32 & n.71.18  With respect to the proposed Westchester Class, using \nU.S. Census Bureau data regarding the adult population in Westchester County, as well as the \nassumptions that 2.3 percent of that population uses a wheelchair and 36 percent of adults have \nused a ridesharing service, Plaintiffs estimate a total of 6,269 putative class members.  Id. at 31-\n32.19  With respect to the New York State Other Than NYC Class, using U.S. Census Bureau \n \n  18 The study cited by Plaintiffs, which was conducted in fall 2018, found that “36% of \nU.S. adults say they have ever used a ride-hailing service such as Uber or Lyft.”  Jingjing Jiang, \nMore Americans are using ride-hailing apps, Pew Research Center (Jan. 4, 2019), available at \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/04/more-americans-are-using-ride-hailing-apps/ \n(last visited Dec. 21, 2022). \n \n  19 Plaintiffs cite U.S. Census Bureau webpages from 2019, but when these pages were \naccessed in December 2022, the data on the pages appeared to be from 2021.  Thus, there are \nsome differences between the data on the referenced webpages and the figures used by Plaintiffs \n37 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 38 of 49\ndata regarding the adult population of New York State outside of New York City, as well as the \nassumptions that 2.3 percent of that population uses a wheelchair and 36 percent of adults have \nused a ridesharing service, Plaintiffs estimate a total of 72,993 putative class members.  Id. at 33.  \nLastly, with respect to the Non-Access Region Class, using U.S. Census Bureau data regarding \nthe adult population of the relevant areas, as well as the assumptions that 2.3 percent of that \npopulation uses a wheelchair and 36 percent of adults have used a ridesharing service, Plaintiffs \nestimate a total of 1,970,078 putative class members.  Id. at 34.  Notably, even if these data \nassumptions are each overstated by a factor of ten—in other words, if only 3.6 percent of adults \nuse a ridesharing service, and if only 0.23 percent of the adult population uses a wheelchair—\neach of the classes would still have more than 40 members. \n  “Courts within this Circuit have frequently relied on reasonable inferences based on \nstatistical data to establish numerosity.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 288-89; see also, e.g., Hernandez, \n323 F.R.D. at 502 (“Hernandez relies on data from publicly available sources to argue that more \nthan 40 people have or will visit AutoZone stores. . . . The Court may take judicial notice of the \nforegoing sources of data, which together show that there are enough class members to satisfy \nthe numerosity requirement for class certification.”); BCID, 290 F.R.D. at 418 (“Relying on the \n2008 American Community Survey from the United States Census Bureau . . . plaintiffs estimate \nthat there are roughly 900,000 people with disabilities in New York City . . ., a number clearly \nrendering joinder impracticable.”).   \n \nin their briefing.  But in each instance, the relevant population figures are larger than the \nnumbers cited by Plaintiffs, which only strengthens Plaintiffs’ numerosity arguments.  \nAccordingly, the Court will rely on the numbers referenced in Plaintiffs’ briefing, as the \ndifferences are not material to either the Court’s analysis or its conclusion regarding this issue.   \n38 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 39 of 49\nMoreover, in addition to the statistical data, Plaintiffs provide declarations of putative \nclass members that bolster their contention that the classes they seek to have certified are \nsufficiently numerous.  See Non-Public Frei-Pearson Decl. Exs. 2, 4-7.  Additionally, the amicus \nbriefs filed by the National Council on Independent Living, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and \nthe United Spinal Association, ECF Nos. 223-225, support the finding that the various classes \nare sufficiently numerous.  Each of these national organizations has members and/or represents \nentities with members numbering in the tens of thousands nationwide, and each has enough \nmembers in each of the relevant regions to satisfy the requirement of numerosity with respect to \neach of the classes sought to be certified.  Id. \nLyft raises various objections to these declarations, as well as to the deposition testimony \nof some of the declarants; in particular, Lyft maintains that the declarations and testimony fail to \ndemonstrate a concrete injury.  Def.’s Opp. at 40-43.  But the Rule 23(a) numerosity analysis is \ndistinct from standing, and these arguments challenging numerosity are the same as its \narguments challenging the standing of putative class members, which this Court has already \nrejected.  Compare Def.’s Opp. at 40-43 with Def.’s Opp. at 33-38; see also BCID, 290 F.R.D. at \n418 (in finding that the plaintiffs had established numerosity, the court noted that “[i]n \ncontending otherwise, defendants largely rehash their arguments about standing . . ., rejected \nabove”). \nIn sum, the Court finds that each of the classes satisfies the requirement of numerosity.20 \n \n  20 Lyft has provided evidence that approximately 35 out of 175 putative class members \nfor whom Lyft was given cell phone numbers and/or email addresses have downloaded the Lyft \napp and thereby agreed to its terms of service, including the requirement that their legal claims \nbe submitted to arbitration.  See Yasay Decl. ¶¶ 9-13 & Ex. A.  There is no question that such \nindividuals cannot be included in any of the classes.  Nevertheless, this percentage of \ndisqualified class members is not so substantial as to preclude a finding that Plaintiffs have \nsatisfied the numerosity requirement for each of the proposed classes. \n39 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 40 of 49\n      b.  Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires a showing that “there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “Commonality does not mean that all issues must be identical \nas to each member, but it does require that plaintiffs identify some unifying thread among the \nmembers’ claims that warrants class treatment.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 291 (cleaned up).  \n“Generally, courts have liberally construed the commonality requirement to mandate a minimum \nof one issue common to all class members.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  “Consideration of \nthis requirement obligates a district court to determine whether plaintiffs have ‘suffered the same \ninjury.’”  Id. at 292 (quotation marks omitted).  Class members’ claims “must depend upon a \ncommon contention,” and “[t]hat common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it \nis capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will \nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Dukes, \n564 U.S. at 350.  “What matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions—\neven in droves—but rather, the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common answers \napt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Id. (emphasis in original) (cleaned up).  “This test \npresents a low hurdle.”  Buffington, 342 F.R.D. at 71 (quotation marks omitted).  \n  Here, with respect to the three Non-Access Region classes, Plaintiffs maintain that the \nclaims of each of the putative classes raise common questions as to whether Lyft has policies or \npractices uniformly applicable to each of those classes that prevent class members from \naccessing WAV services, and whether these allegedly discriminatory policies or practices can be \nremedied by reasonable modifications that are common to each class.  The answers to those \nquestions will drive the resolution of the litigation, as any proposed reasonable modification \napplicable to a given class that would allow class members to access WAV services would \n40 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 41 of 49\nbenefit each class in its entirety.  Where, as here, “the plaintiff class seeks to enjoin a practice or \npolicy, rather than individualized relief, commonality is assumed.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 292 \n(cleaned up).   \n  With respect to the three Non-Access Region classes, Plaintiffs assert that “Lyft has a \nuniform, centralized policy and practice of affirmatively and categorically precluding WAV \nservice in all non-Access Regions (which are over 96% of Lyft’s service regions).”  Pls.’ \nRevised Mem. at 44.  More specifically, Plaintiffs state that “[d]rivers in non-Access Regions are \nprevented from identifying as WAVs on Lyft’s app, and riders do not have the option of \nselecting a WAV ride in non-Access Regions.”  Id.  Therefore, “even when a Lyft WAV driver is \navailable in a non-Access Region (which Lyft’s data shows is often the case), the driver would \nnot be able to identify as such on the platform, nor would a user requiring a WAV be able to \nrequest a ride from that WAV driver.”  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that “[g]iven Lyft’s general policy of \ndiscrimination here, all Non-Access Regions class members suffer from Lyft’s systemic policy, \nwhich thereby satisfies commonality.”  Id.  This Court agrees.  Plaintiffs here challenge policies \nand practices that Lyft implements on class-wide bases with respect to each of the putative \nclasses, and propose injunctive relief tailored to the respective classes.  This is sufficient to \nsatisfy the requirement of commonality.  See, e.g., WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 292. \n  By focusing its response on the question of whether reasonable modifications can be \nimplemented to provide relief to Plaintiffs, Lyft misses the mark for purposes of the \ncommonality requirement.  See Def.’s Opp. at 44-49.  Whether or not appropriate and effective \nreasonable modifications can be put in place goes to the merits of Plaintiffs’ ADA claim, not the \n41 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 42 of 49\nresolution of Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  See ECF No. 264 (“D&O”) at 5.21  The \nissue for the Court at the class certification stage is not whether the reasonable modifications that \nPlaintiffs propose Lyft could make to accommodate their disabilities are viable, but whether the \nquestion of what constitutes viable reasonable modifications can be resolved on a class-wide \nbasis.  See Houser v. Pritzker, 28 F. Supp. 3d 222, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).  For each of the three \nputative classes Plaintiffs have met this threshold. \n      c.  Typicality \n  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical \nof the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “Typicality is satisfied if each \nclass member’s claim arises from the same course of events, and each class member makes \nsimilar legal arguments to prove the defendant’s liability.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 293 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  Moreover, “like commonality . . . typicality may be assumed where the nature \nof the relief sought is injunctive and declaratory.”  Id. (cleaned up).  Here, Plaintiffs allege that \nwith respect to each of the putative classes, Lyft imposed uniform discriminatory policies with \nrespect to its WAV services.  Again, Lyft focuses on the merits of the reasonable modifications \nproposed by each of the putative classes—“the effectiveness and cost of the modifications in \neach location”—to argue lack of typicality.  Def.’s Opp. at 49-50.  But this does not diminish the \nfact that the ADA claim of each putative class arises from the same course of allegedly \ndiscriminatory conduct engaged in by Lyft with respect to the failure to provide WAV services, \nand that each putative class makes uniform arguments regarding the reasonable modifications \nthat Lyft could implement to make its services accessible.  “Where, as here, the alleged injuries \n \n  21 As noted above, 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(A) states that discrimination includes the \nfailure to “make reasonable modifications consistent with those required under section \n12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title.” \n42 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 43 of 49\nderive from a unitary course of conduct by a single system, typicality is generally found.”  BCID, \n290 F.R.D. at 419 (quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, with respect to each of the putative \nclasses, Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement. \n      d.  Adequacy \n  Under Rule 23(a)(4), the Court “must examine whether the named plaintiff's interests are \nantagonistic to those of the other proposed members of the class.”  Buffington, 342 F.R.D. at 72 \n(cleaned up).  “A class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and \nsuffer the same injury as the class members.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 298 (quotation marks \nomitted).  “The adequacy inquiry is twofold: the proposed class representative must have an \ninterest in vigorously pursuing the claims of the class, and must have no interests antagonistic to \nthe interests of other class members.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  “In addition, to establish \nadequacy, class counsel must be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the \nlitigation.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted). \n  Lyft’s argument with respect to adequacy is based on the suggestion that differences in \nthe potential level of WAV services that could be provided between Access and Non-Access \nRegions if Plaintiffs’ proposed reasonable modifications were adopted give rise to conflicting \ninterests between the class representatives and putative class members.  Def.’s Opp. at 50-52.  \nThis argument speaks once again to the merits of the proposed modifications and whether they \nare reasonable, as well as whether they will be effective; moreover, in light of the Court’s \nrecommendation regarding the lack of standing of Scudieri, Burr, Lowell, and WDOMI with \nrespect to the Access Regions and NYC classes, any possible conflict between the Access \nRegion and Non-Access Region classes is moot.   \n43 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 44 of 49\n  Lowell and WDOMI are adequate class representatives for the Non-Access Region Class, \nthe New York State Other Than NYC Class, and the Westchester Class.  Lowell is an individual \nwith disabilities who requires WAVs to travel, and WDOMI is an entity with a mission of \nadvocating for people with disabilities.  Lowell and WDOMI have actively engaged in \ndiscovery.  Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 49-50.  As Plaintiffs note, “each Class seeks slightly different \nrelief.  However, the relief sought does not conflict.  All relief sought would force Lyft to \nprovide WAV service everywhere it operates and would benefit all class members.”  Pls.’ Reply \nat 25 (emphasis in original).  The class representatives here have an interest in vigorously \npursuing the claims of the class; they seek the same relief as the class members they seek to \nrepresent; and they do not have interests that are antagonistic to the class members.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have demonstrated the adequacy of Lowell and WDOMI to serve as class \nrepresentatives for the three remaining classes at issue. \n  There has been no challenge the adequacy of class counsel, and this Court finds that \nFinkelstein, Blankinship, Frei-Pearson & Garber, LLP, Morgan & Morgan, P.C., and Michael \nHellman—all of whom are qualified and experienced and have proven themselves capable of \nconducting this litigation—are adequate class counsel for this matter.   \n    2.  Ascertainability \n  “[A] class is ascertainable if it is defined using objective criteria that establish a \nmembership with definite boundaries.”  In re Petrobras Secs., 862 F.3d 250, 257 (2d Cir. 2017).  \nAs a threshold matter, however, “[i]t is not clear that the ascertainability requirement applies to \nRule 23(b)(2) class actions[,] as notice is not obligatory and the relief sought is injunctive rather \nthan compensatory.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 299 (cleaned up).  At a minimum “[i]n Rule 23(b)(2) \ncases, where the relief sought does not include class-wide monetary damages, the ascertainability \n44 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 45 of 49\nrequirement is less stringent than in cases certified under Rule 23(b)(3).”  Robinson v. N.Y.C. \nTransit Auth., No. 19-cv-01404 (AT) (BCM), 2020 WL 5884055, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, \n2020), adopted by 2020 WL 5814189 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2020).  “Both the Second Circuit and \nnumerous district courts in the circuit have approved of class definitions without precise \nascertainability under Rule 23(b)(2).”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  “It would be illogical to \nrequire precise ascertainability in a suit that seeks no class damages.”  Id. (cleaned up).   \n  Although Lyft makes a passing reference to the requirement of ascertainability, see Def.’s \nOpp. at 33 n.13, the only challenges it makes to the class definitions relate to the issue of \nstanding, see Def.’s Opp. at 33-38, and those challenges have been rejected for the reasons \nexplained above.  In any event, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the ascertainability \nrequirement.  Each of the proposed classes is defined using objective criteria—specifically, that \nan individual requires a WAV for vehicular transportation, resides in or visits the geographic \narea specific to the class, and is denied access to Lyft’s services.  See Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 3.  \nTo the extent that the classes might include future members, this “does not pose an obstacle to \ncertification.”  WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 299 (quotation marks omitted).  In sum, Plaintiffs’ class \ndefinitions meet the “less stringent” standard for ascertainability applicable to this case. \n* * * * * * * * * * \n  In sum, Plaintiffs have carried their burden with respect to all four requirements of Rule \n23(a) and the ascertainability requirement. \n    3.  The Rule 23(b)(2) Standard  \n  Rule 23(b)(2) provides that “[a] class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied \nand if . . . the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \nto the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \n45 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 46 of 49\nrespecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “The key to the (b)(2) class is the \nindivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct \nis such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to \nnone of them.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (quotation marks omitted). \n  The parties dispute whether uniform injunctive relief could be provided as to each of the \nproposed classes.  Plaintiffs contend that “[i]njunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate \nbecause [Lyft] has acted on grounds generally applicable to each of the classes, and because such \nrelief would apply to and benefit each of the respective classes as a whole.”  Pls.’ Revised Mem. \nat 54.  In response, Lyft states that “Plaintiffs have given this Court no basis on which it could \nconclude that the Court could fashion some form of injunction that would benefit all members of \nPlaintiffs’ proposed classes,” pointing out that this Court noted in a prior decision that Plaintiffs \ndo not cite their expert’s opinions in discussing the issue of whether they satisfy the requirements \nof Rule 23(b)(2).  Def.’s Opp. at 53; see D&O at 7.  But this Court’s prior decision went on to \nsay that  \n[a]s one district court aptly stated in addressing a motion for certification \nof a Rule 23(b)(2) class in a case involving claims of racial discrimination,  \n \n[i]n the event that the Court determines that the challenged hiring \nprocedures had a disparate impact on minority applicants, there are \na number of injunctive and declaratory remedies that the Court \ncould order that would apply equally to all class members. . . . At \nthis stage in the litigation, it is not necessary to speculate about the \nprecise contours of such relief.  All that matters is that the Court \nhas the equitable power and the practical ability to fashion some \nform of injunctive or declaratory relief that would apply to all \nmembers of the proposed (b)(2) class.  \n \nHouser, 28 F. Supp. 3d at 249 (emphasis added).   \n \nD&O at 7. \n46 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 47 of 49\n  Here, too, the issue on Plaintiffs’ class certification motion is whether the Court “has the \nequitable power and the practical ability to fashion some form of injunctive or declaratory relief \nthat would apply to all members” of Plaintiffs’ proposed Rule 23(b)(2) classes—not what the \nspecifics of that relief would be.  Plaintiffs challenge uniform policies that Lyft follows in each \nof the different regions covered by each of the proposed classes and seek the implementation of \nproposed reasonable modifications tailored to each of those uniform policies.  “[A] plaintiff class \nseeking classwide structural relief that would clearly redound to the benefits of each class \nmember is the paradigmatic Rule 23(b)(2) class action.”  Shepard v. Rhea, No. 12-cv-7220 \n(RLE), 2014 WL 5801415, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 7, 2014) (quotation marks omitted).  This is \nprecisely the situation presented in this matter. \n  The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) with \nrespect to each of their proposed classes.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully recommend that Plaintiffs’ motion for class \ncertification (ECF No. 282) be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.   \n  I respectfully recommend that Your Honor certify three proposed classes:22 \n•  All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft, \naside from Lyft’s Access Regions or NYC, who require WAVs for \nvehicular transportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \ntransportation services (the Non-Access Region Class) (represented by \nLowell and WDOMI and asserting claims under the ADA); \n \n•  All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft in \nNew York State aside from NYC who require WAVs for vehicular \ntransportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \n \n  22 Because the Court “is not bound by the class definition proposed in the complaint, and \nis empowered to carve out an appropriate class,” WILC, 331 F.R.D. at 301 (quotation marks \nomitted), the Court adopts the class definitions, including the class representatives, as set forth in \nPlaintiffs’ moving brief, see Pls.’ Revised Mem. at 3. \n47 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 340   Filed 12/22/22   Page 48 of 49\ntransportation services (the New York State Other Than NYC Class) \n(represented by Lowell and WDOMI and asserting claims under the \nADA and NYSHRL); and  \n \n•  All residents of or visitors to Westchester County who require WAVs \nfor vehicular transportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \ntransportation services (the Westchester Class) (represented by Lowell \nand WDOMI and asserting claims under the ADA and NYSHRL). \n \nExcluded from the classes are people who (1) have downloaded the Lyft app; (2) have brought \nseparate litigation against Lyft for its failure to serve people with disabilities; and/or (3) are \nresidents of Ohio State University or the University of Texas at Austin who do not leave those \ncampuses.   \nNOTICE \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(l) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe parties shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file \nwritten objections.

ROMAN, United States District Judge \nPlaintiffs Harriet Lowell and Westchester Disabled on the Move, Inc. (\"WDOMI\"), on \nbehalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, bring this putative class action against \nDefendant Lyft, Inc. in their amended complaint filed on December 6, 2017 (\"Amended \nComplaint,\" ECF No. 20).  Plaintiffs assert claims under Title III of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12184; New York State Human Rights Law \n(\"NYSHRL\"), N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 290 - 97; and New York City Human Rights Law \n(\"NYCHRL\"), N. Y. City Admin. Code § § 8-101  31. 1 Presently before the Court is \nDefendant's  Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure Rules 12(b )(1) and 12(b )(6) (\"Defendant's Motion,\" ECF No. 31 ).  For the following \nreasons, Defendant's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \n1 Plaintiffs also submitted a motion for the appointment of interim lead counsel, but on March 23, 2018, \nPlaintiffs withdrew this request without prejudice (ECF No. 30). \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 2 of 24\nBACKGROUND \nI.  Factual Background \nThe following facts are derived from the Amended Complaint and the documents \nappended thereto, and are assumed to be true for the purposes of this motion. \nPlaintiff Lowell resides in White Plains, New York and typically uses a motorized \n,r,r \nscooter to travel.  (Am. Compl.  12 - 13.)  To assist her in travel throughout Westchester \nCounty and in her bi-monthly trips to New York City, Plaintiff Lowell would like to use \n,r,r \nDefendant's transportation services.  (Id.  14, 102.)  PlaintiffWDOMI is a Yonkers, New York \nnonprofit, run largely by individuals with disabilities, and operates as an independent living \n,r,r \ncenter for individuals with disabilities. (Id.  18 - 19.)  WDOMI's mission includes the \n\"empower[ing] people with disabilities to control their own lives, advoca[ting] for civil rights \nand a society free of barriers to people with disabilities\" and \"ensuring that people with mobility \n,r,r \ndisabilities are able to effectively use the transportation services they require.\"  (Id.  20 - 21.) \nMembers of WDOMI \"have been and will be injured\" as a result of Defendant's actions, \n,r \ndescribed below.  (Id.  22.) \nBy downloading Defendant's ride-hailing application, a customer can remotely hail a \nnearby vehicle, select her destination, and pay through a payment method saved in the \n,r \napplication.  (Id.  33.)  Defendant operates both in White Plains and in Westchester County. (Id. \n,r,r \n24, 29.)  Unlike New York's Boro Taxi services, or \"for hire\" livery services, Defendant is \nnot subject to the Taxi and Limousine Commission's (\"TLC\") rules and regulations of \n,r \naccessibility for disabled individuals.  (Id.  35.)  While Defendant requires that its New York \nCity drivers register with the TLC, Defendant is not subject to the TLC's 2014 agreement to \n2 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 3 of 24\n,r \nmake fifty percent of all taxis operating in New York City wheelchair accessible by 2020.  (Id. \n36.) \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant \"pervasively and systematically\" excludes people with \n,r \nmobility disabilities from its convenient transportation services. (Id.  38.)  To support this \nallegation, Plaintiffs note that Defendant does not make wheelchair accessible vehicles \n(\"WAV  s\") available in Westchester County; individuals who attempt to hail wheelchair \naccessible rides in that county receive a text message with alternative transportation services. \n,r,r \n(Id.  46, 48.)  In areas where WAV  s are available, users with mobility disabilities must toggle \nto the \"Access Mode\" function in Defendant's smartphone application to be matched with a \n,r,r \nWAV, and those individuals often experience long wait times.  (Id.  47, 49.)  While there are \ntransportation alternatives to the service offered by Defendant, none are replacements for \nDefendant's services.  New York City's subway is largely impossible for people with disabilities \n,r,r \nto use and its bus system is limited and \"largely inefficient.\" (Id.  41 - 42.)  Taxicabs do not \noffer the same convenience provided by Defendant's service, which includes the ability to pay \nwithout using cash or presenting a credit card to the driver.2 (Id. ,r,r 87 - 88.)  Trips around \nWestchester County are difficult for Plaintiff Lowell because there is limited local paratransit. \n(Id. ,I 105.) \nPlaintiff Lowell learned of Defendant's ongoing discrimination from \"friends and \nacquaintances who have mobility disabilities and have witnessed [Defendant]'s failure to provide \n,r \nequivalent, non-discriminatory service.\"  (Id.  100.)  A friend from White Plains told Plaintiff \nhe tried to order an accessible Lyft, was informed that none were available, and received a text \n2 New York City taxicabs now offer the Curb application, which enables users to hail and pay for a taxi \nfrom their smartphones, much like the service offered by Defendant.  Curb: The Taxi App, \nhttps://mobileapp.gocurb.com/ (last visited Nov. 21, 2018). \n3 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 4 of 24\nmessage from Defendant telling him to obtain an alternate method of transit.  (Id.)  Because \nDefendant does not provide WAV  s, Plaintiff Lowell and members of the putative class have \nbeen deterred from downloading Defendant's application or trying to access Defendant's \nservices as any attempt would be futile even though access to Defendant's services would \nimprove their lives.  (Id. ,i,r 101, 116.)  If Plaintiff Lowell had equal access to Defendant's \nservices, she would be able to travel about Westchester County more often.  (Id. ,i 105.) \nAdditionally, Plaintiff Lowell would be able to visit New York City on a more frequent basis. \n(Id. ,i 104.)  Currently, she goes to and from New York City approximately twice a month and, \nbecause she cannot use Defendant's services, she must rely on her husband to transport her in \ntheir WAV.  (Id. ,r 102.) \nDue to Defendant's failure to provide equal, accessible transportation, Plaintiffs cannot \nbenefit from Defendant's services.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant's actions are in violation of \nthe ADA, NYSHRL and NYCHRL.  Plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief under the \nADA and compensatory damages in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief under the \nNYSHRL and NYCHRL.  Specifically, Plaintiffs request that the Court require Defendant to \ndevelop and implement a remedial plan to ensure full and equal access to its services. \nDefendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint due to lack of standing, the \nexistence of an arbitration agreement in Defendant's terms of Service, and Plaintiffs' failure to \nstate a claim. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nWhen a court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate a case, it should \ndismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b) (1 ).  Nike, Inc. v. \nAlready, LLC, 663 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 2011 ).  \"A plaintiff asserting subject matter jurisdiction \n4 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 5 of 24\nhas the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it exists.\" Morrison v. Nat'! \nAust!. Bank Ltd., 547 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Makarova v.  United States, 201 F.3d \n110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000)).  In assessing whether there is subject matter jurisdiction, the Court \nmust accept as true all material facts alleged in the complaint, Conyers v. Rossides, 558 F.3d \n137, 143 (2d Cir. 2009), but \"the court may resolve [any] disputed jurisdictional fact issues by \nreferring to evidence outside of the pleadings.\" Zappia Middle E. Const. Co. v. Emirate ofA  bu \nDhabi, 215 F.3d 247, 253 (2d Cir. 2000).  Lack of standing may be grounds for dismissal under \nRule 12(b)(l). See Buonasera v. Honest Co., 208 F. Supp. 3d 555, 560 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must plead \"enough facts to state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.\" Bell At!. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A \nclaim is facially plausible when the factual content pleaded allows a court \"to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \"While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, \nthey must be supported by factual allegations.\" Id. at 679.  A complaint must supply \"factual \nallegations sufficient 'to raise a right to relief above the speculative level' \"to move beyond a \nmotion to dismiss. ATS] Commc 'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  In deciding a motion to dismiss, a court must take all \nmaterial factual allegations as true and draw reasonable inferences in the non-moving party's \nfavor. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  However, the court is\" 'not bound to accept as true a legal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation,' \" or to credit \"mere conclusory statements\" or \n\"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action.\" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n555). \n5 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 6 of 24\nFurther, a court is generally confined to the facts alleged in the complaint for the \npurposes of considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to 12(b)(6). Cartee Indus. v. Sum Holding \nL.P., 949 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. 1991).  A court may, however, consider documents attached to the \ncomplaint, statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, matters of \nwhich judicial notice may be taken, public records, and documents that the plaintiff either \npossessed or knew about, and relied upon, in bringing the suit. See Kleinman v. Elan Corp., 706 \nF.3d 145, 152 (2d Cir. 2013). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Standing \nThe Court must first address whether Plaintiffs have standing to bring their Amended \nComplaint before dete1mining whether Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim for relief.  See \nBuonasera v. Honest Co., 208 F. Supp. 3d 555,560 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (noting that comis should \nconsider jurisdictional issues such as standing first in a motion to dismiss analysis).  A1iicle III \nrequires federal comis to adjudicate actual cases and controversies.  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. \nTo ensure that there is a case or controversy, the Supreme Comi has held that paiiies before \nfederal courts must have standing to bring their claims.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 560 (1992).  A plaintiff has standing if she has suffered \"(1) an injury that is (2) 'fairly \ntraceable to a defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct' and that is (3) 'likely to be redressed by \nthe requested relief.'\" Id. 560-61 (quotingA!lenv. Wright, 468U.S. 737,751 (1984)).  Forthe \npurposes of standing, an injury must be an injury in fact, meaning \"an invasion of a legally \n6 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 7 of 24\nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and patiicularized ... and (b) actual or imminent, not \n'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.'\" Id. at 560 (citations and quotation marks omitted). \nWhere, as here, standing is challenged at the pleadings stage, a court must \"accept as true \nall material allegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the \ncomplaining patiy.\"  United States v.  Vazquez,  145 F.3d 74, 81 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \"To survive the motion to dismiss, the pleadings must only 'allege facts that \naffirmatively and plausibly suggest that [Plaintiffs have] standing to sue.' \"Boelter v. Hearst \nCommc'n, Inc., 192 F. Supp. 3d 427,437 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (quotingAmidax Trading Grp. v. \nS. WIF. T., 671 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2011)).  A plaintiffs \"standing allegations need not be \ncrafted with precise detail.\"  Baur v.  Veneman, 352 F.3d 625, 631 (2d Cir. 2003). \nWhen a claim arises from a civil rights statute, such as the ADA, comis must exercise \nspecial care in conducting a standing analysis.  \"The Supreme Court has instructed courts to take \na broad view of constitutional standing in civil rights cases, especially where, as under the ADA, \n'complaints by private persons are the primary method of obtaining compliance with the Act.' \" \nFiedler v.  Ocean Prop., Ltd., 683 F. Supp. 2d 57, 65 (D. Me. 2010) (quoting Trafficante v. \nMetro. Life Ins., Co., 409 U.S. 205,209 (1972)); see also Harty v. Spring Valley Marketplace \nLLC, No. 15-CV-8190(NSR), 2017 WL 108062, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2017); Baker v. NY \nState Dep't ofE nvtl. Conservation, No. 10-CV-1016 (GLS)(RFT), 2012 WL 2374699, at *2 \n(N.D.N.Y. June 22, 2012). \nA.  Plaintiff Lowell \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff Lowell lacks standing to bring this action because she \nfailed to identify a concrete injury as she did not sign up for Defendant's application or otherwise \nattempt to obtain a ride from Defendant.  (Def.'s Mot. p. 12.)  To plausibly demonstrate the first \n7 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 8 of 24\nelement of standing, injury, an individual with a disability is not required to \"engage in a futile \ngesture if such person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this subchapter \ndoes not intend to comply with its provisions.\"  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(l).  This Circuit has not \nsettled upon a clear definition of\"actual notice.\"3  Kreisler v. Second Ave. Diner Corp., No. 10-\nCV-7592(RJS), 2011 WL 4686500, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2011).  The majority of cases suggest \nthat \"actual knowledge\" under the futile gesture analysis comes from the plaintiff personally \nwitnessing the alleged accessibility issue. See Pickem v. Holiday Quality Foods, Inc., 293 F.3d \n1133 (9th Cir. 2002); Perdum v. Forest City Ratner Cos., 174 F. Supp. 3d 706, 715 (E.D.N.Y. \n2016); Shariffv. Radamar Meat Corp., No. 1 l-CV-6369(NGG)(RML), 2014 WL 1311563, at *2 \n(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2014); Small v. Gen. Nutrition Cos., 388 F. Supp. 2d 83, 88 - 89 (E.D.N.Y. \n2005). \nIn cases where a plaintiff did not personally observe the accessibility issue in the \nbuilding, comis have generally held that the plaintiff lacked standing.  The Eighth Circuit has \nheld that one plaintiff had standing because he entered the relevant building and observed the \nfacility before bringing the lawsuit and that other plaintiffs who did not enter or observe the \nfacility did not have standing.  Steger v. Franco, Inc., 228 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir. 2000).  A New \nYork comi held that a list of ADA violations prepared after the inspection of a building was not \nsufficient to establish actual knowledge.  Access 4 All, Inc. v.  Trump Int 'l Hotel and Tower \nCondo., 458 F. Supp. 2d 160, 174-75 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).  Similarly, a Florida court held that \n3 Actual notice is also referred to in case law as \"actual knowledge.\" See, e.g., Perdum v. Forest City \nRatner Cos., 174 F. Supp. 3d 706, 714-15 (E.D.N.Y. 2016); Shariffv. Radamar Meat Corp., No. ll-CV-\n6369(NGG)(RML), 2014 WL 1311563, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2014); Access 4 All, Inc. v. Trump Int'! Hotel and \nTower Condo., 458 F. Supp. 2d 160. 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). \n8 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 9 of 24\nknowledge of accessibility conditions at a building derived from a website was not actual \nknowledge.  Resnick v. Magical Cruise Co., Ltd., 148 F. Supp. 2d 1298 (M.D. Fla. 2001). \nThe case before the Court is distinct from the cases discussed above in that Plaintiffs' \nclaims are not about access to a building, but access to transpmiation facilitated through a digital \napplication.  \"Congress clearly contemplated that 'service establishments' include providers of \nservices which do not require a person to physically enter an actual physical structure.\" Nat'! \nFed'n oft he Blind of Cal. v.  Uber Tech., Inc., 103 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1083 (N.D. Cal. 2015) \n(quoting Carparts Distrib. Ctr., Inc. v. Auto. Wholesaler's Ass'n ofN  ew England, Inc., 37 F.3d \n12, 13 (1st Cir. 1994)).  Unlike accessibility conditions in a building, an individual cannot \npersonally observe the objectionable conditions in Defendant's service without downloading the \napplication, requesting a ride, and being refused.  This would require Plaintiffs to engage in a \nfutile gesture, as they had actual knowledge that Lyft did not offer sufficient accessible \ntranspmiation for those with mobility disabilities.  Plaintiffs plausibly allege that they had actual \nknowledge of the accessibility issues with Defendant's service.  Contrary to the Defendant's \nstatement that Plaintiff Lowell's knowledge of Defendant's accessibility issues was based on a \nconversation with one person, the Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff Lowell had heard \nfrom multiple people that requesting a ride through Defendant's application was futile for \nindividuals in need of WAV  s.  (Compl. ,i 100) (Def.'s Mot. p. 12.)  Accordingly, taking a broad \nview of constitutional standing and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff \nLowell, as required at the motion to dismiss stage, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009), \nPlaintiff Lowell plausibly claimed an injury for the purposes of standing. \nPlaintiffs' Amended Complaint also plausibly establishes the second and third elements \nof standing with respect to Plaintiff Lowell.  Her injury, not having equal access to Defendant's \n9 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 10 of 24\nservices, is fairly traceable to Defendant and the Court would likely be able to redress this injury \nby requiring Defendant to comply with accessibility laws.  (Compl. p. 28); See Reed v. 1-800 \nFlowers.com, 327 F. Supp. 3d 539, 550 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (citing cases stating that courts may \nrequire defendants to comply with the ADA). \nBecause Plaintiff Lowell meets each of the requirements for standing, Defendant's \nmotion to dismiss Plaintiff Lowell's claim for lack of standing is denied. \nB.  Plaintiff WDOMI \nAccording to Defendant, Plaintiff WDOMI lacks associational or organizational standing \nto file this action.  (Def.' s Mot. pp. 13 - 18.) \nl.  Associational Standing \nAn organization has associational standing if it can show that (1) its members would have \nstanding to sue in their own right; (2) the interests it seeks to protect relate to the organization's \npurpose; and (3) neither the asserted claim nor the requested relief require the participation of \nindividual members of the lawsuit.  Hunt v.  Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm 'n, 432 U.S. 333, \n343 (1977). \nPlaintiffs' Amended Complaint establishes the first element; its members would have \nstanding to sue in their own right.  Members of Plaintiff WDOMI, like Plaintiff Lowell, \"rely on \ncompliance by public accommodations, including transportation services, with local, state, and \nfederal [accessibility] disability laws\" and have been deterred from using Defendant's \n,r,r \ntransportation services because of Defendant's failure to comply with these laws.  (Comp 1.  31, \n116, 120 & 127.)  Requiring Defendant to comply with accessibility laws would redress this \ninjury.  (Id. p. 28); See Reedv. 1-800-Flowers.com, 327 F. Supp. 3d 539,550 (E.D.N.Y. 2018). \nThus, because the Amended Complaint contains sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that \n10 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 11 of 24\nmembers of Plaintiff WDOMI suffered an concrete and particularized injury, fairly traceable to \nDefendant's conduct and able to be redressed by the Comi, the Court is satisfied that they \nWDOMI members would independently have standing. \nPlaintiff WDOMI easily satisfies the second element of associational standing.  The \ninterests it seeks to protect through this lawsuit, equal and accessible access to transp01iation \npublic accommodations, fall squarely within its purpose.  \"A key component of WDOMI's \nmission is ensuring that people with mobility disabilities are able to effectively use the \ntransportation services they require.\"  (Compl. ,i 21.) \nHowever, PlaintiffWDOMI does not establish the third element for its NYSHRL and \nNYCHRL claims; it fails to plausibly show that neither Plaintiff WDOMI' s claim nor the relief \nrequested requires the participation ofWDOMI's members.  \"[W]here the organization seeks a \npurely legal ruling without requesting that the federal comi award individualized relief to its \nmembers, the Hunt test may be satisfied.\"  Bano v.  Union Carbide Corp., 361 F.3d 696, 714 (2d \nCir. 2004).  In Hunt, the Supreme Court found that neither the interstate commerce claim nor the \nrequests for declaratory or injunctive relief required individualized proof and held that both \nclaims were properly resolved \"in a group context.\" Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344.  Here, unlike the \nPlaintiffs in Hunt, Plaintiffs request compensatory damages in addition to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief for their NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims.  (Compl. ,i 25.)  A request for \ncompensatory damages, such as the request in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, requires the \nparticipation of a group's individual members.  Irish Lesbian and Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d \n638,651 (2d Cir. 1998). \n11 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 12 of 24\nAccordingly, Plaintiff WDOMI does not have associational standing for its NYSHRL and \nNYCHRL claims because it fails to satisfy the third prong of the associational standing analysis \nfor those claims. \n2.  Organizational Standing \nTo have organizational standing, an organization must establish that there is (1) an \nimminent injury \"to itself as an organization (rather than to its members) that is 'distinct and \npalpable' \"; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions; and (3) the court can \nredress the injury.  Centro de la Comunidad Hispana de Locust Valley v.  Town of Oyster Bay, \n868 F.3d 104, 109 (2d Cir. 2017).  For organizational standing, an organization is \"just another \nperson-albeit a legal person-seeking to vindicate a right.\"  NY. Civil Liberties Union v. NY. \nCity Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286,294 (2d Cir. 2012). \nHere, Plaintiff WDOMI fails to satisfy the first element, an injury to itself as an \norganization.  Plaintiff WDOMI states that it is injured because it must divert resources to \nadvocate \"for its constituents who are harmed by Lyft's discriminatory policies and practices.\" \n,r \n(Compl.  22.)  This injury is not distinct from the matter before the Court.  Rather, Plaintiff \nWDOMI's stated injury results from WDOMI's efforts to pursue this very lawsuit.  In Havens \nRealty Corp. v. Coleman, the Supreme Court held that \"concrete and demonstrable injury to an \norganization's activities-with the consequent drain on the organization's resources-constitutes \nfar more than simply a setback to the organization's abstract social interests\" and that such an \ninjury could be sufficient to establish organizational standing.  455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982). \nHowever, lower courts disagree about how broadly Havens should be applied. \nThe circuit courts are split on whether litigation expenses alone is an injury sufficient to \nsupport organizational standing.  See Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Wash. v.  Trump, \n12 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 13 of 24\n276 F. Supp. 3d 174, 192 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).  Some circuit courts hold that the expenditure of \nresources for litigation is insufficient to confer standing.  People for the Ethical Treatment of \nAnimals v.  US. Dept. ofA  gric., 797 F.3d 1087, 1093 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\"[A]n organization's \ndiversion of resources to litigation or to investigation in anticipation of litigation is considered a \n'self-inflicted' budgetary choice that cannot qualify as an injury in fact for purposes of \nstanding.\"); Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 767 F.3d 247,285 (3d Cir. 2014) (holding that \norganizations do not satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of standing by \"making expenditures \nsolely for the purpose of litigation\").  Other circuit courts adopt a broader interpretation of \nHavens and hold that diversion of resources from core organizational activities to litigation \nchallenging a defendant's conduct is a sufficient injury for organizational standing so long as the \ninjury is concrete.  See N.A.A.C.P. v. City ofK  yle, 626 F.3d 233,239 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding \nthat an organization's alleged injury, examining developments in local zoning ordinances, was \n\"simply a setback to the organization's abstract social interests\" and not a diversion ofresources \nsufficient to show a concrete injury); Ragin v. Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co., 6 F.3d 898, 905 \n(2d Cir. 1993).  In Ragin, an organization challenged the use of only white models in \nadvertisements for housing and alleged that it sustained an injury because the defendant's actions \nforced the organization to identify and counteract the defendant's advertising practices.  Ragin, 6 \nF .3d at 901.  The Second Circuit agreed and held that the organization had an injury sufficient to \nsupp01i organizational standing.  Id. at 905. \nAfter Ragin, some courts in this Circuit have found standing where a defendant's conduct \ninterferes with or otherwise burdens an organization's ability to pursue its usual activities.  See \nCentro de la Comunidad Hispana de Locust Valley, 868 F.3d at 110; N. Y Civil Liberties Union, \n684 F.3d at 295.  Other courts have extended Havens further and held that an organization has \n13 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 14 of 24\nstanding when it is forced to \"expend resources to prevent some adverse or harmful consequence \non a well-defined and particularized class of individuals.\"  See Olsen v. Stark Homes, Inc., 759 \nF.3d 140, 158 (2d Cir. 2014); Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Wash., 276 F. Supp. 3d at \n190 (holding that the organization, interested in protecting citizens' rights to be informed of \ngovernment activity, did not have standing because it made the choice to challenge the \ndefendant's actions and was not attempting to prevent or reverse adverse effects).  In Olsen, \nLong Island Housing Services (\"LIHS\"), along with other plaintiffs, claimed that the defendant \ndiscriminated against individuals based on their disabilities in violation of the Fair Housing Act. \nOlsen, 759 F.3d at 143.  To determine whether the defendant's actions were discriminatory in \nviolation of the Fair Housing Act, LIHS sent testers to the defendant's facility.  Id. at 143 - 44. \nLIHS then submitted administrative complaints, based on information from the testers, to the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. Id. at 144.  These complaints were submitted \nbefore the plaintiffs commenced their suit against the defendant in federal court.  Id.  The court \nheld that LIHS' s allegations that it expended resources by sending testers to the defendant was a \nconcrete and particularized injury.  Id. at 158. \nHere, Plaintiff WDOMI fails to plausibly allege that it sustained an injury sufficient to \nsupport organizational standing.  Unlike LIHS in Olsen, PlaintiffWDOMI does not allege that \nDefendant's conduct caused it to expend any resources separate from this litigation or that it was \n·otherwise impeded in its ability to pursue its mission.  There is no indication in the Amended \nComplaint that Defendant WDOMI conducted any sort of investigation or otherwise expended \nresources because of Defendant's conduct at issue before this action.  Plaintiff WDOMI claims \nthat it suffered injury \"in the form of diversion of [its] resources and frustration of its mission,\" \nbut this allegation is conclusory and unsupported by any facts in the Amended Complaint. \n14 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 15 of 24\n(Compl. ,i 22.)  The Amended Complaint does not include any facts, beyond the aforementioned \nconclusory allegation, to plausibly support that Defendant's conduct interfered WDOMI's ability \nto pursue its mission or that it was forced to divert resources to prevent an adverse consequence, \nlike LIHS in Olsen.  Thus, PlaintiffWDOMI fails to establish an injury to itself as an \norganization, the first element of organizational standing. \nThus, because Plaintiff WDOMI cannot satisfy all of the elements for organizational \nstanding and cannot satisfy all of the elements for associational standing specifically for its \nNYCHRL and NYSHRL claims, WDOMI only has standing to pursue its ADA claim. \nII.  Enforcement of Arbitration Clause \nDefendant next argues that the arbitration waiver in its terms of Service (\"TOS\") applies \nto Plaintiffs' claims under the direct benefits estoppel doctrine, even though Plaintiffs did not \nsign up for Defendant's application or agree to the TOS.  (Def.'s Mot. p. 8.)  Defendant's TOS \n\"explicitly states that the claims subject to arbitration include claims alleging discrimination and \nclaims under the ADA.\" (Id. p. 9.)  Non-signatories can be bound to arbitration agreements under \nfive distinct theories: \"(1) incorporation by reference; (2) assumption; (3) agency; (4) veil \npiercing/alter ego; and (5) estoppel.\" Am. Bureau ofS hipping v.  Tencara Shipyard S.P.A., 170 \nF.3d 349, 352 (2d Cir. 1999).  Defendant moves to dismiss under the estoppel theory, which \nstates, \"A party is estopped from denying its obligation to arbitrate when it receives a \n'direct benefit' from a contract containing an arbitration clause.\" Am. Bureau ofS hipping, 170 \nF.3d at 353.4  Benefits may be direct, meaning coming directly from the agreement, or they may \n4 Defendant cites to Robinson Brog Leinwand Greene Genovese & Gluck P. C. v. John M  O 'Quinn & \nAssociates, L.L.P., which describes the doctrine as follows: \"When a non-signatory plaintiff seeks the benefits ofa \ncontract that contains an arbitration provision, it is estopped from 'denying its obligation to arbitrate.' \" 523 F. \nApp'x 761,763 (2d Cir. 2013); (Def.'s Mot. p. 9.) However, the majority of Second Circuit opinions, as well as \nopinions from other circuit courts, describe the requisite benefit under this doctrine as something that the plaintiff \nhas already received, not something she seeks.  Compare Hirsch v. Citibank, NA., 542 F. App'x 35, 37 (2d Cir. \n2013); AICO Int'!, E.C. v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 98 F. App'x 44, 46 (2d Cir. 2004); Spechtv. Netscape Commc'ns \n15 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 16 of 24\nbe indirect in that the non-signatory \"exploits the contractual relation of parties to the agreement, \nbut does not ... [assume] the agreement itself.\"  Boroditskiy v. European Specialties LLC, 314 F. \nSupp. 3d 487,495 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting MAG Portfolio Consultant, GMBH v. Merlin \nBiomed Grp. LLC, 268 F.3d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 2001)). \nHowever, Plaintiffs here have not received a benefit from Defendant's TOS; that is the \nwhole problem.  Plaintiffs' entire claim is that they are unable to benefit from Defendant's \n,r,r \nservices due to Defendant's failure to accommodate their disabilities. (Compl.  103, 107 & \n109.)  It seems supremely unjust to hold individuals to an arbitration clause buried in the \nverbiage of a terms of service of agreement for a service that they did not sign up for, \nparticularly when those individuals have not received any benefits from the agreement, direct or \nindirect.  Courts have upheld arbitration agreements in terms of service contracts because the \nplaintiffs were presented with the opportunity to review the terms in the form of a hyperlink \nbefore signing up for the service.  See Bassett v. Elec. Arts Inc., 13-CV-4208(MKB)(SMG), 2015 \nWL 1298644, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2015); Fteja v. Facebook, Inc., 841 F. Supp. 2d 829, 839 \n40 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).  Unlike the plaintiffs in those cases, Plaintiffs here did not sign up for \nDefendant's service and do not allege that they were ever presented with the TOS to review. \nRequiring Plaintiffs to arbitrate under the TOS would hold them to an arbitration clause in an \nagreement they neither signed up for nor benefited from, and therefore direct benefits estoppel \ndoes not apply. \nCorp., 206 F.3d 17, 39 (2d Cir. 2002); MAG Portfolio Consultant, GMBH v. Merlin Biomed Grp. LLC, 268 F.3d 58, \n61 (2d Cir. 2001); Am. Bureau ofS hipping v. Tencara Shipyard S.P.A., 170 F.3d 349, 353 (2d Cir. 1999); Ried v. \nDoe Run Res. C01p., 701 F.3d 840,846 (8th Cir. 2012); Pacific Unidata Ltd. v. Avon Prod. Inc., 107 F. App'x 754, \n755 (9th Cir. 2004); Bridas S.A.P.I.C. v. Turkmenistan, 345 F.3d 347, 361-62 (5th Cir. 2003); Int'! Paper Co. v. \nSchwabedissen Maschinen & Anlagen GMBH, 206 F.3d 411,418 (4th Cir. 2000), with Robinson Brog Leinwand \nGreene Genovese & Gluck P.C., 523 F. App'x at 763; World Omni Fin. C01p. v. Ace Capital Re Inc., 64 F. App'x \n809, 812 (2d Cir. 2003). Because the majority of Second Circuit opinions support the latter definition and have not \nbeen overruled, the Court will proceed under that definition. \n16 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 17 of 24\nBecause Plaintiffs have not agreed to Defendant's TOS and are not otherwise estopped \nfrom avoiding the arbitration agreement in the TOS, the Court will analyze whether Plaintiffs \nplausibly establish violations under the ADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. \nIII.  Plaintiffs' Civil Rights Claims \nA.  Title III ADA \nAccording to Defendant, Plaintiffs fail to state a plausible claim for relief because \"the \nonly relief they seek-that the Court order Lyft to provide WAV  s-is not available as a matter of \nlaw.\"  (Def.'s Mot. p. 20.)  However, as Plaintiffs acknowledge, the Amended Complaint does \nnot include a specific request that Defendant be required to provide WAV  s but does request that \nthe Defendant be required to \"develop and implement a remedial plan to ensure full and equal \naccess to its services.\"  (Compl. p. 28) (Pls.' Opp'n pp. 17 - 18.) \nWhether the Court has the authority to require Defendant to provide WAV  s is irrelevant \nat this stage.  On a motion to dismiss, the Court must only determine whether Plaintiffs stated a \nclaim for relief that is plausible on its face and is obligated to draw all reasonable inferences in \nPlaintiffs' favor.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The Amended Complaint contains \nnumerous factual allegations surrounding Defendant's failure to provide WAV  s.  However, \nPlaintiffs' request for relief is not that the Court require Defendant to provide WAV  s but that the \nCourt (1) declare that Defendant's policies and practices violate the ADA; (2) enjoin Defendant \nfrom further violations of the ADA; and (3) require that Defendant develop and implement a \nplan to ensure equal access to its services.  (Compl. p. 28.)  Drawing all reasonable inferences is \nPlaintiffs' favor, the Court interprets the allegations surrounding Defendant's deficient WAV \nofferings as supp01i for Plaintiffs' claim that Defendant violates the ADA by discriminating \nagainst people with mobility disabilities and not as a request for relief.  A request for injunctive \n17 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 18 of 24\nreliefrequiring compliance with the ADA, such as Plaintiffs' request for relief, is sufficient to \nwithstand a motion to dismiss.  See Reedv. 1-800-Flowers.com, 327 F. Supp. 3d 539, 550-51 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2018).  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' have requested a form ofrelief \nwhich can be granted. \nDefendant does not raise other grounds to dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint under \nRule 12(b)(6).  Assuming Defendant also moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' ADA claim for failure to \nplausibly allege each of the elements of the claim, the Court would still deny the motion to \ndismiss.  Under Title III of the ADA, \"[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis \nof disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \nadvantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, \nleases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\"  42 U.S.C. § 12182(a).  To \nstate a claim for relief under Title III, a plaintiff must allege that (1) she is disabled within the \nmeaning of the ADA; (2) the defendants own, lease, or operate a place of public accommodation; \nand (3) the defendants discriminated against her by denying her a full and equal opportunity to \nenjoy the defendant's services.  Rosa v. 600 Broadway Partners, LLC, 175 F. Supp. 3d 191, 198 \n- 99 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citing Camarillo v. Carrots Corp., 518 F.3d 153, 156 (2d Cir. 2008)). \nPlaintiffs satisfy each element of an ADA claim based on the face of the Amended \nComplaint.  First, they meet the first element of an ADA claim by plausibly alleging that they are \n,r \nindividuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA.  (Compl.  127.)  Plaintiffs also \nsatisfy the second element for the purposes of this motion to dismiss, that Defendant operates a \npublic accommodation.  Defendant disputes that it is a public accommodation in the business of \ntransportation and a covered entity under Title III of the ADA, but Defendant aclmowledges that \nPlaintiffs allege it is a transportation company and that the Court is required to accept Plaintiffs' \n18 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 19 of 24\nallegations as true for the purpose of the motion to dismiss.  (Def.'s Mot. p. 2); See \n42 U.S.C. § 12181(7).  The Amended Complaint states that Defendant operates a public \naccommodation.  (Compl., 132.)  If Plaintiffs' statements on the face of the Amended \nComplaint were not sufficient, the Court would still be unable to grant Defendant's motion to \ndismiss on the issue of whether Defendant is a public accommodation.  It is premature to decide \nthe question of whether a defendant is a public accommodation at the motion to dismiss phase. \nNat'! Fed'n oft he Blind of Cal. v.  Uber Tech., Inc., 103 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1083 (N.D. Cal. 2015) \n( denying the defendant's motion to dismiss because more factual development was required to \ndetermine whether the defendant, Uber, was a public accommodation under the ADA); see \nRamos v.  Uber Tech., Inc., No. 14-CA-502(XR), 2015 WL 758087, at *6 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 20, \n2015) (denying the defendant's motion to dismiss and holding that the plaintiffs had not failed to \nprove that Lyft and Uber offer public accommodations under the ADA).  Therefore, the Court \nwill consider Defendant to be a covered entity under Title III of the ADA for the purposes of this \nmotion and finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the second prong of the ADA analysis. \nFinally, Plaintiffs state a facially plausible claim that Defendant discriminated against \nPlaintiffs by denying them a full and equal opp01iunity to enjoy Defendant's services based on \ntheir disabilities.  In Lincoln Cercpac v. Health and Hospital Corp., the court granted the \ndefendant's motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs failed to allege that there was a service they \nwere being denied or that they were being denied equal access to a service.  977 F. Supp. 274, \n280 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).  Unlike the plaintiffs in Lincoln Cercpac, Plaintiffs in this case allege that \nDefendant is denying them equal access to a service, specifically Defendant's transp01iation \nservices, because of their disabilities.  (Compl. ,, 109- 10, 136, 137.) \n19 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 20 of 24\nThus, Plaintiffs' ADA claim survives Defendant's motion to dismiss, assuming \nDefendant also argues that Plaintiffs failed to plead a plausible ADA claim, because the \nAmended Complaint contains sufficient facts to plausibly support each element of that claim. \nB.  NYSHRL \nClaims under the NYSHRL are analyzed using the same standards that apply to the ADA. \nKemp v. Metro-North R.R., 316 F. App'x 25, 26 (2d Cir. 2009).  Accordingly, the three element \ntest articulated in the Court's ADA analysis applies here.  See Rosa, 175 F. Supp. 3d at 198 - 99. \nAs stated supra, for the purposes of this motion, there is no dispute that Plaintiffs are disabled \nwithin the meaning of the ADA or that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Defendant is a \npublic accommodation.  Additionally, the Amended Complaint contains sufficient facts to \nplausibly support Plaintiffs' claim that Defendant discriminated against them by denying them a \n,r,r \nfull and equal opportunity to enjoy its ridesharing services.  (Compl.  109 - 10, 136, 137.) \n\"Defendant denies individual [sic] who use motorized and other non-folding wheelchairs, \nincluding Plaintiff Lowell [and] WDOMI members ... full and equal enjoyment of Defendant's \n,r \nservices.\"  (Id.  137.) \nBecause Plaintiffs have stated a facially plausible claim for each of the required elements, \nDefendant's motion to dismiss the NYSHRL claim is denied. \nC.  NYCHRL \nComis \"must analyze NYCHRL claims separately and independently from any federal \nand state law claims\" and must construe NYCHRL provisions broadly and in favor of the \nplaintiff.  Mihalikv. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013). \n20 \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 49   Filed 11/29/18   Page 21 of 24\nIn Snowden v. Trustees of Columbia University, the Second Circuit held that the district court \nproperly dismissed a plaintiffs NYCHRL claim after conducting a separate analysis and \nfocusing on the \"broad and remedial\" aspects of the NYCHRL.  612 F. App'x 7, 10 (2d Cir. \n2015). \nUnder NYCHRL, it is unlawful for any owner of a place or provider of public \naccommodation to deny an individual full and equal enjoyment, on equal terms and conditions, \nof accommodations or services based on an individual's disability.  N.Y. City Admin Code§§ 8-\n107(4).  Unlike in Westchester County, Defendant offers WAV  s in New York City.5 (Compl. ,r,r \n46-49).  The issue is, according to Plaintiffs, that there are long wait times for WAV  s in New \nYork City for those individuals requiring WAV  s because Defendant does not provide enough \nsuch vehicles.  (Id. ,r 49.)  There is no case law to indicate that extended wait times for a public \naccommodation is a NYCHRL violation.  While it is a NYCHRL violation to entirely exclude a \nperson with a disability from accessing a public accommodation, see All Island Airport Serv., \nInc. v. NY State Div. ofH  uman Rights, 127 A.D.3d 967,968 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015), that is not \nthe situation before the Court.  Defendant offers, albeit in a small number, WAV  s in New York \nCity.  Analyzing Plaintiffs' NYCHRL claims separately, and construing the provisions broadly, \nthe Court finds that Plaintiffs failed to state a facially plausible claim under the NYCHRL \nbecause they did not plausibly allege a NYCHRL violation. \n5 By enabling access mode in the Lyft application, users seeking rides in New York City have the option to \nhail a WAY.

(“WDOMI”) \n(collectively “Plaintiffs”), by and through their undersigned attorneys, on behalf of themselves \nand on behalf of all others similarly situated, hereby make the following allegations against \nDefendant Lyft, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Lyft”), with personal knowledge as to their own actions, \nand upon information and belief as to those of others: \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  This actions seeks to redress Defendant’s ongoing discrimination against disabled \nindividuals, particularly people who require the use of wheelchairs or other assistive devices for \nmobility.   \n2.  Transportation access is a central civil rights issue for people with disabilities.  In \n1978 in Denver, the lack of accessible transportation led a group of wheelchair users to block \nbusses with their own bodies to protest the buses’ inaccessibility.  That protest grew to a national \nmovement and, in 1990, led to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), with \n{00289358  }   \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 2 of 29\n \nits guarantee of full participation in all aspects of society, working to end the historical isolation \nand segregation of people with disabilities.   \n3.  In passing the ADA, Congress embraced a national mandate to eliminate \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities, including discrimination in travel services.  As a \nHouse Committee report on the bill that would become the ADA aptly stated:  “Transportation is \nthe linchpin which enables people with disabilities to be integrated and mainstreamed into \nsociety.”  Without reliable transportation options, people cannot maintain employment, obtain \nhealthcare, visit friends and family, or otherwise be full and regular participants in civil life.   \n4.  However, as new technologies and innovations are creating a watershed change in \ntransportation services across the United States, some of the emerging leaders in the public \nconveyance and transportation industry, including Defendant, are implementing pervasive and \nsystematic policies of discrimination against disabled individuals.  With these new transportation \nservices rapidly supplanting traditional public conveyances, such discriminatory policies threaten \na return to the isolation and segregation that the disability rights movement has fought to \novercome. \n5.  Defendant is one of the most prominent companies in the revolutionary and \ndisruptive new smartphone application-based ridesharing transportation industry, which provides \nnew freedom of travel for many people throughout the United States, including in New York \nCity and Westchester County.  Lyft and similar companies are now a significant part of the \nnational transportation system and are positioning themselves to be an indispensable part of the \ntransportation systems of the future. \n6.  Lyft, like other ridesharing transportation companies, uses an electronic ride-\nhailing application, available for use on smartphones, to allow users of this application to \n{00289358  }  2 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 3 of 29\n \nsummon drivers to their location, designate a destination, and make payments electronically.  \nThis provides millions of riders with the highly convenient ability to arrange cheap, door-to-door \ntransportation with just a few minutes’ notice. \n7.  Defendant has secured its prominent position in the ridesharing market by \nrepresenting to consumers that it will provide consumers with a ride from a friendly driver within \nminutes.  As a result, Lyft generates billions of dollars in revenue annually. \n8.  Were it to be reliably accessible to people who use wheelchairs and other assistive \ndevices, Lyft’s transportation service could have life-changing effects for such individuals, \nimproving their ability to work, study, participate in community life, and generally to live more \nindependently. \n9.  However, the reality is that Lyft’s promises of accommodation are only available \nto able-bodied consumers.  As a large-scale public accommodation, Lyft has demonstrated a total \ndisregard for the needs of people with disabilities in the provision of its transportation services, \nand has persistently and systematically failed to ensure that these services are available to \ndisabled individuals. \n10.  As a result, disabled individuals are routinely denied accommodations in \ntransportation on the basis of their disabilities.  As a provider of public conveyances and public \naccommodations, Lyft’s ongoing policies and practices thus deny equal service to disabled \nindividuals in violation of federal, state, and local laws. \n11.  This suit is brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n12181, et seq., the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law § 290, et seq., \n(“NYSHRL”), and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq., \n(“NYCHRL”). \n{00289358  }  3 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 4 of 29\n \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Harriet Lowell is a citizen of New York residing in White Plains, New \nYork.   \n13.  Plaintiff Lowell has a mobility disability that substantially limits the major life \nactivity of walking.  Plaintiff typically uses a motorized scooter to travel.  In order for Plaintiff to \ntravel by car or van, the vehicle must be equipped with a ramp or lift to accommodate her \nscooter.  Plaintiff is a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA, NYSHRL, and \nNYCHRL. \n14.  Plaintiff Lowell would like to use Lyft’s transportation services, both in \nWestchester County and in her trips to and from New York City.  However, Plaintiff has been \ndeterred from using Lyft’s transportation services because she is aware that Lyft discriminates \nagainst people with mobility disabilities in its transportation services. \n15.  Plaintiff Lowell plans to and will attempt to use Lyft’s ride-hailing application \nand Lyft’s programs, services, facilities, and accommodations in the future, should those \nprograms, services, and facilities, and accommodations become wheelchair accessible. \n16.  Plaintiff Lowell presently fears that she will encounter the mobility-related \nbarriers and unequal services which exist within Lyft’s transportation system. \n17.  Plaintiff Lowell continues to desire to utilize Lyft’s ride-hailing application and \ntransportation services, but will continue to be deterred until the violations detailed herein are \nremoved. \n18.  Plaintiff Westchester Disabled on the Move, Inc. is a non-profit community based \norganization headquartered in Yonkers, New York.  Within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 796f-4, \nWDOMI operates as an independent living center, a consumer-controlled, community-based, \n{00289358  }  4 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 5 of 29\n \ncross-disability, nonresidential private nonprofit agency, designed and operated within a local \ncommunity by individuals with disabilities and providing an array of independent living services.   \n19.  WDOMI is an organization that is run and governed by people with disabilities, in \naccordance with 29 U.S.C. §§ 796f-4(c)(2) and (6).  The majority of WDOMI’s board members \nand staff are persons with disabilities, including mobility-related disabilities. \n20.  WDOMI’s mission, in compliance with 29 U.S.C. § 796f-4(b)(1), is to empower \npeople with disabilities to control their own lives, advocate for civil rights and a society free of \nbarriers to people with disabilities, encourage people with disabilities to become politically and \nsocially active, educate government entities, businesses, other organizations, and society as a \nwhole to understand, accept and accommodate people with disabilities, and generally create and \nenvironment for people with disabilities that inspires self-respect. \n21.  A key component of WDOMI’s mission is ensuring that people with mobility \ndisabilities are able to effectively use the transportation services they require.  To this end, \nWDOMI has expended time and resources on advocacy work to improve access, including \ntransportation options, for disabled residents of Westchester County. \n22.  WDOMI itself has been injured as a direct result of Defendant’s actions and \nomissions as discussed herein.  WDOMI’s interests are adversely affected because it must \nexpend resources advocating for its constituents who are harmed by Lyft’s discriminatory \npolicies and practices.  WDOMI has suffered injury in the form of diversion of these resources \nand frustration of its mission. \n23.  In addition, one or more members of WDOMI have been and will be injured as a \ndirect result of Defendant’s discriminatory policies and practices and would have standing to sue \nin their own right.  WDOMI can bring this action on behalf of its members because the interests \n{00289358  }  5 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 6 of 29\n \nat stake are germane to WDOMI’s purpose and neither the claims it asserts, nor the relief it \nrequests, require the participation of individual members in this lawsuit. \n24.  Defendant Lyft, Inc. is a foreign corporation, organized and existing under the \nlaws of the State of Delaware, with its principal place of business located in San Francisco, \nCalifornia.  It is a ridesharing transportation company, providing transportation services, public \nconveyance, and public accommodation to customers in the United States, including New York.  \nIt has thousands of customers in New York and elsewhere, and billions of dollars in revenues. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n25.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Title III of the \nADA.  Plaintiffs also seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and compensatory damages \npursuant to the NYSHRL and NYCHRL.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction under the \nprovisions of the ADA pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 and 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and supplemental \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ remaining claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, because those claims \nare related to Plaintiffs’ federal claims and rise out of a common nucleus of operative facts.  \n26.  This Court has diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1) because \nthe parties to this action are citizens of different states. \n27.  Venue is appropriate in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), because \nPlaintiffs reside in this District, and were denied equal service in this District on the basis of their \ndisabilities.  Defendant is also liable for systemically denying accommodation in transportation \nto disabled individuals throughout this District; Defendant maintains significant business \ncontacts within this District; and Defendant engaged in the unlawful conduct alleged in this \nComplaint within this District. \n28.  Following the commencement of this action, a copy of this Complaint will be \nserved on both the New York City Commission for Human Rights and the Office of the \n{00289358  }  6 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 7 of 29\n \nCorporation Counsel of the City of New York, thereby satisfying the notice requirements of the \nNew York City Administrative Code. \nBACKGROUND FACTS \n29.  Millions of people in the United States depend on a wheelchair or other assistive \ndevices for day-to-day tasks and mobility.  In New York City alone, as of 2014, more than \n500,000 non-institutionalized residents have a mobility-related disability.  Hundreds of \nthousands of people with disabilities, moreover, visit New York City, Westchester County, and \nother regions across the country serviced by Lyft each year.  \n30.  Plaintiff Lowell relies on compliance by public accommodations, including \ntransportation services, with local, state, and federal disability accessibility requirements, in \norder to gain equal access to all services as people without disabilities. \n31.  Plaintiff WDOMI’s members rely on compliance by public accommodations, \nincluding transportation services, with local, state, and federal disability laws’ requirements to be \naccessible, in order to gain equal access to all services as people without disabilities. \n32.  In or about 2012, Defendant launched its ride-hailing application to connect riders \nand drivers to provide public conveyance and transportation services across urban and suburban \nareas across the United States.  Lyft began offering its public conveyance services in New York \nCity on or about July 25, 2014, and presently offers its services in Westchester County, as well. \n33.  By using Lyft’s ride-hailing application, a customer can remotely hail a nearby \nLyft vehicle, select a destination to which he or she wishes to be driven, and have all payments \nfor this conveyance electronically processed. \n34.  However, since its inception and throughout its operation in New York City, \nWestchester County, and in hundreds of other regions throughout the United States, Lyft has \nremained a relatively unregulated public transportation entity. \n{00289358  }  7 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 8 of 29\n \n35.  For instance, unlike New York’s traditional Yellow and Green Boro Taxi cabs, as \nwell as “For-Hire” Livery Vehicles, Lyft’s drivers and public conveyance operations remain \nlargely beyond the purview of the Taxi and Limousine Commission’s (“TLC”) rules and \nregulations with respect to accessibility for disabled individuals. \n36.  While Lyft requires that its New York City drivers be registered with the TLC, it \nis not subject to the TLC’s 2014 agreement to enact regulations so as to render 50% of all \ntaxicabs operating in New York City accessible to individuals requiring the use of a wheelchair \nby 2020.1  Instead, Lyft continues to operate without any regulatory requirement that it purchase, \nconvert, or provide accessible vehicles to the public. \n37.  Lyft provides a valuable transportation alternative to millions of individuals \nthroughout the United States, allowing people to more easily travel to work, social events, \ncommunity engagements, appointments, and other destinations, yet Lyft pervasively and \nsystematically excludes people with mobility disabilities from these same benefits of its \nconvenient transportation. \n38.  Lyft and its fellow application-based ride-sharing transportation companies are \nquickly supplanting traditional taxi companies and becoming the public’s primary option for on-\ndemand transportation services. \n39.  Lyft’s quarterly ridership more than doubled between the fourth quarter of 2015, \nwhen it logged 21.1 million rides, to the fourth quarter of 2016, when it logged 52.6 million \nrides. \n                                                            \n1 This agreement was reached as part of a settlement in a federal class action:  The Taxis For All \nCampaign, et al. v. New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, et al., No. 11-237, ECF No. \n220-1 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). \n{00289358  }  8 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 9 of 29\n \n40.  Conversely, traditional taxicab ridership has declined.  In New York City alone, \nthe average number of yellow cab rides decreased by over 120,000 rides per day between \nNovember 2010 and November 2016.  \n41.  As ridesharing companies, like Lyft, grow, it could be an especially crucial \ntransportation option for people with disabilities because other transportation options also have \nsignificant barriers to access.  For example, the New York City subway system is largely \nunusable by people with disabilities, as almost 80% of its stations are inaccessible for anyone \nwho cannot use stairs.  And even if the subways were completely accessible, the system does not \nextend to many New York City neighborhoods the way that Lyft does. \n42.  New York City’s bus system is even more limited, particularly after major service \ncuts that have occurred over the past decade, and is an agonizingly slow and largely inefficient \nmeans of travel overall. \n43.  New York City’s paratransit system has been widely criticized as ineffective, and \nit provides users with a dramatically more limited level of service than is available to riders who \nare able to reliably use subways and buses. \n44.  On-demand transportation services, such as Lyft, can fill the significant \ntransportation gaps for riders with disabilities, if providers operate these services in a non-\ndiscriminatory way. \n45.  However, Lyft does not operate its services in a non-discriminatory way. \n46.  In Westchester County and many other cities and regions where Lyft provides its \ntransportation service, Lyft does not make wheelchair-accessible vehicles available at all. \n47.  People with mobility disabilities must toggle on the “Access Mode” function in \nthe Lyft smartphone application to attempt to be matched with a wheelchair-accessible vehicle. \n{00289358  }  9 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 10 of 29\n \n48.  In the numerous cities and regions where Lyft does not make any wheelchair-\naccessible vehicles available, including Westchester County, customers with Access Mode \nenabled who attempt to use the Lyft smartphone application to hail a ride are simply sent a text \nmessage with information on other transportation services in the area.  As Lyft itself \nacknowledges on its website, “Many of [these] accessible vehicle dispatches must be booked at \nleast 24 hours in advance,” and that “it may take several weeks to complete the enrollment \nprocess before being able to book a ride” with such vendors thereby defeating the primary \nbenefits of Lyft’s service, e.g. convenience and the ability to hail a ride on short notice.2  \n49.  Even in cities and regions where Lyft does make some wheelchair-accessible \nvehicles available, such vehicles typically make up only an extremely small portion of Lyft’s \nvehicle fleet.  Thus, customers with Access Mode enabled routinely experience significantly \nlonger wait times to be matched with a wheelchair-accessible vehicle.  \n50.  Lyft exercises very significant, comprehensive, and detailed control over its \ntransportation services and drivers. \n51.  Lyft decides who may provide its transportation services.  Individuals who wish \nto drive as part of the Lyft transportation service undergo a screening process and must be at \nleast 21 years of age, complete various forms, undergo a driving record check, undergo a check \nfor registered sex offender status, undergo a seven-year criminal background check, complete an \nin-person interview with a current Lyft driver, and present their driver’s license (which they must \nhave had for more than 1 year), vehicle registration, and proof of driver’s insurance.  In addition, \n                                                            \n2 See Lyft.com, “Accessible Vehicle Dispatch,” available at  \nhttps://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/213584508-Accessible-vehicle-dispatch (last visited Aug. \n11, 2017). \n{00289358  }  10 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 11 of 29\n \nbefore a driver may use a vehicle to provide Lyft services in New York City, the driver must \nobtain a TLC commercial license. \n52.  Lyft exercises exclusive control over termination of Lyft drivers.  Lyft routinely \nterminates drivers for any of several reasons, including for poor customer satisfaction ratings or \ndiscriminatorily refusing to provide service to customers. \n53.  Lyft controls which trip requests it transmits to each of its drivers. \n54.  Lyft requires all drivers to provide it with information about the make, model, and \nage of the vehicle that they will drive while providing Lyft transportation. \n55.  Lyft sets standards for which vehicles can be driven to provide Lyft \ntransportation. \n56.  Lyft also sets standards for which vehicles can be driven for various classes of \nLyft transportation services, such as Lyft, Lyft Plus, and Lyft Premier. \n57.  Lyft prohibits its drivers from discriminating against people based on race, \nreligion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex, marital status, gender identity, age, or \nany other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law. \n58.  Lyft instructs drivers that they should consistently accept a high share of the trip \nrequests that they receive through Lyft’s app. \n59.  Lyft prohibits drivers from accepting street hails from potential passengers. \n60.  Lyft encourages drivers to provide personal information to their respective \nprofiles, as available through the Lyft smartphone application, including information such as the \ndriver’s hometown and music preferences. \n61.  In addition, Lyft issues training and directives concerning other requirements to \nLyft drivers. \n{00289358  }  11 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 12 of 29\n \n62.  Lyft closely monitors its drivers. \n63.  Lyft records numerous details about the rides that its drivers provide, including \nthe pickup location, time of pickup, drop off location, time of drop off, distance traveled, route \ntaken, trip duration, and customer’s identity for each trip. \n64.  Furthermore, Lyft also monitors its drivers’ performance by asking customers for \nwritten feedback and a 1 to 5 “star” rating for each ride to be provided after every trip via the \nLyft smartphone application.  Lyft likewise allows its drivers to rate and provide feedback on \ncustomers.  \n65.  Lyft regularly terminates or suspends Lyft drivers whose average customer rating \nfalls below a certain threshold. \n66.  In addition, Lyft maintains commercial liability policies for each driver to cover \nclaims concerning incidents that occur while drivers are providing Lyft transportation services. \n67.  Lyft tightly controls payments for its transportation services. \n68.  Lyft likewise controls who may use Lyft’s transportation services. \n69.  Lyft makes its services available only to members of the public who have a credit \ncard and a smartphone capable of running one of Lyft’s applications, who create a Lyft account, \nand who request a ride through Lyft’s smartphone application, or to individuals traveling with \nthese Lyft customers or in vehicles ordered by these Lyft customers. \n70.  Customers do not pay Lyft’s drivers directly. \n71.  Lyft automatically charges a customer’s credit card after the rider arrives that the \ndesired destination. \n72.  Customers can also provide gratuities to drivers through the Lyft application. \n{00289358  }  12 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 13 of 29\n \n73.  Lyft has exclusive control over the fares that customers pay and the compensation \nthat its drivers receive.  \n74.  Fares for Lyft’s transportation services are based on the duration and distance of \neach trip and other factors such as demand at the time and place of the ride, as determined by \nLyft. \n75.  Lyft keeps a percentage of each fare. \n76.  Thus, Lyft compensates its drivers based on the duration and distance of the trips \nthat they provide to riders.  Payments are not transferred directly from customers to drivers; \nrather, Lyft collects and holds customer payments, deducts fees, and then later transfers money \nto drivers. \n77.  Customers who dispute the fare for a particular trip must contact Lyft customer \nservice representatives to request an adjustment to their fares. \n78.  Lyft encourages its drivers to provide feedback, in the form of a rating of one to \nfive “stars,” for riders. \n79.  Thus, Lyft closely monitors and controls interactions between its drivers and \ncustomers. \n80.  Across the United States, in approximately 300 cities and regions, Lyft provides \ntransportation services totaling approximately 18.7 million rides per month through its fleet of \nvehicles. \n81.  This massive transportation service allows members of the public to quickly and \nefficiently obtain a ride through Lyft. \n82.  Customers choose which class of Lyft service they want.  Customers can choose, \nfor instance, Lyft services that provide luxury vehicles, standard vehicles, and large vehicles.  In \n{00289358  }  13 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 14 of 29\n \nmany cities, customers can choose to use an option that will carpool passengers with other riders \nheading in the same direction for a reduced fare. \n83.  Customers select the class of Lyft service they want, and then request a vehicle. \n84.  Lyft’s application matches the rider with a nearby driver who is providing \ntransportation service with the requested class of vehicle.  For example, a customer who requests \na Lyft Plus service will be matched with a driver operating a six-seater vehicle. \n85.  After the Lyft application matches the rider and the driver, the driver picks up the \nrider and transports the rider to the rider’s desired destination. \n86.  While Lyft offers a range of services and classes of vehicles, the overwhelming \nmajority of the vehicles in its fleet are not wheelchair accessible. \n87.  By denying disabled individuals accommodation in the form of accessible \nvehicles, Lyft also denies disabled individuals who require such accommodations the ability and \nright to utilize and enjoy the attractive features that have made Lyft’s services so popular and \ndesired.  These services are not available with taxicab services. \n88.  These features include the ability to pay for a ride without using cash or \npresenting a credit card because Lyft charges the customer’s previously-entered credit card \ninstantly when the vehicle reaches the rider’s destination. \n89.  Another key Lyft feature is the ability to call for a ride from anywhere in New \nYork City and throughout Westchester County without having to identify a particular company \nthat serves the neighborhood where the customer is presently located.  Taxi companies and \nneighborhood livery services often serve only limited geographical areas, but Lyft is available \nthroughout New York City and Westchester County, as well as in hundreds of other cities across \nthe United States. \n{00289358  }  14 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 15 of 29\n \n90.  Lyft offers door-to-door service across New York City and Westchester County, \nas well as in hundreds of other cities across the United States, and has precise locator technology.  \nThis is unlike taxi services, which typically must be hailed on major thoroughfares, or livery \nvehicles, which typically must be called via telephone with an address specified. \n91.  Lyft vehicles typically are higher-end vehicles than those used as medallion taxis \nor livery vehicles, giving the rider the feeling of traveling in an exclusive, safe, and private \nvehicle rather than a typical taxicab. \n92.  When Lyft fails to provide full and equal service to disabled individuals who \nrequire wheelchair-accessible vehicles, these individuals experience numerous harms. \n93.  At times, because of delays or a total lack of wheelchair-accessible vehicle \navailability, disabled individuals must arrange alternate transportation that is sometimes more \ncostly and significantly less convenient. \n94.  People who use wheelchairs also face the denigrating experience of being denied \na basic service that is available to all other paying customers. \n95.  Even when a wheelchair-accessible vehicle is technically available, because so \nfew exist there are typically frequent and lengthy delays.  Thus, people who require such \nvehicles and use Lyft’s services are harmed because they must contend with missed \nappointments, being late for events, and other stress and inconvenience related to these delays. \n96.  By denying equal service to riders needing wheelchair-accessible vehicles, Lyft \ncauses real harm by interfering with their ability to work, attend school, shop for groceries, \nreceive medical care, enjoy entertainment and cultural events, maintain family and social ties, \nand otherwise participate fully in civil life.  \n{00289358  }  15 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 16 of 29\n \n97.  Due to distances between destinations and the severe limitations of public \ntransportation and paratransit, many persons with disabilities must use private transportation \nservices to travel from one place to another.  Such alternative transportation may be more costly, \nless convenient and/or less comfortable. \n98.  When people do not have ready access to transportation, they suffer significant \nsocial isolation and seclusion as well as other harms. \n99.  Plaintiff Lowell was given notice that Lyft has very few wheelchair-accessible \nvehicles in its service, and that people who need such vehicles often cannot get service from a \nLyft vehicle at all, or frequently have wait times far longer than people who do not need such \nvehicles.   \n100.  Plaintiff Lowell is aware of the ongoing discrimination by Lyft against people \nwith disabilities because she has heard from friends and acquaintances who have mobility \ndisabilities and have witnessed Lyft’s failure to provide equivalent, non-discriminatory service.  \nFor example, when Plaintiff Lowell’s friend in White Plains tried to order an accessible Lyft, he \nwas told that none were available and received a text message from Lyft advising him to obtain \nalternate methods of transit.  Plaintiff Lowell’s friend recounted this experience to Plaintiff \nthereafter. \n101.  Because Lyft does not provide equal service to people with disabilities who need \nwheelchair-accessible vehicles, such as Plaintiff Lowell, she has been deterred from trying to \naccess Lyft’s transportation services, knowing that the attempt would be futile. \n102.  Plaintiff Lowell commutes from White Plains, New York, to New York City and \nback approximately twice each month, including monthly healthcare visits.  Plaintiff Lowell \nwould like to travel to and from New York City more often, but is presently limited by \n{00289358  }  16 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 17 of 29\n \ninadequate transportation options available to her as Westchester County’s paratransit service \ndoes not extend to New York City and New York City’s subways and public transportation \noptions are largely inaccessible to her.  Currently, she is only able to travel to, from, and \nthroughout New York City when her husband is available to drive her in his wheelchair-\naccessible van.   \n103.  When Plaintiff Lowell’s husband is unavailable to drive her, her ability to travel is \nsignificantly reduced.  When her husband was undergoing surgery in New York City, she was \nunable to visit him. \n104.  If Plaintiff Lowell had reliable access to Lyft’s transportation services, she would \nlike to travel to, from, and around New York City more often. \n105.  Within White Plains and Westchester County, Plaintiff Lowell is also limited in \nher mobility.  Due to local paratransit’s limited availability and long wait times, she is often \nunable to travel to locations within the region.   \n106.  As with many scooters and motorized wheelchairs, Plaintiff Lowell’s scooter is \nnot waterproof, and its battery can easily short circuit in the rain.  Her assistive device is also not \ndesigned for travel over snow or dirt-covered surfaces, where it can skid, sink, or otherwise \neasily get stuck.  Due to her chair not being waterproof or easy to operate in the snow, Plaintiff \nLowell is often unable to travel even relatively short distances when it is raining or snowing. \n107.  If Plaintiff Lowell had reliable access to Lyft’s transportation services, she would \nlike to travel to locations within Westchester County more often, including at times when \ninclement weather currently prevents her from traveling even relatively short distances in her \nmotorized wheelchair. \n108.  Plaintiff Lowell has not signed up for an account with Lyft. \n{00289358  }  17 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 18 of 29\n \n109.  Plaintiff Lowell is aware that Lyft provides affordable, efficient, and convenient \ntransportation services to individuals who do not use wheelchairs, and she would use Lyft if \nequal services and benefits were available to her and other individuals with mobility disabilities \nwho require wheelchair accessible vehicles.  \n110.  The harm to Plaintiff Lowell is on-going as Lyft continues to employ an \ninherently discriminatory business model that denies disabled passengers, such as Plaintiff, \nservices by refusing to equip its vehicles in a manner to as to make them accessible. \n111.  As such, absent Court intervention, Plaintiff Lowell will continue to suffer from \nLyft’s discriminatory practices indefinitely. \n112.  Because Lyft closely controls, monitors, supervises, and manages its drivers and \nvehicle fleet, Lyft is capable of adopting the policy changes and taking the steps necessary to \nensure that its fleet provides equal access to riders who require wheelchair accessible vehicles. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n113.  Plaintiffs bring this action for injunctive and declaratory relief on their own \nbehalf, on behalf of WDOMI’s members, and on behalf of all persons similarly situated, \nincluding all residents in and visitors to all cities and regions serviced by Defendant with \nmobility disabilities who have been and are currently being discriminated against by Defendant’s \nactions and omissions as alleged herein. \n114.  Plaintiff Lowell also brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief on her \nown behalf and on behalf of a subclass consisting of all persons similarly situated and all \nresidents in and visitors to all cities and regions located in New York State serviced by \nDefendant with mobility disabilities who have been and are currently being discriminated against \nby Defendant’s actions and omissions as alleged herein.  (“New York State Subclass”) \n{00289358  }  18 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 19 of 29\n \n115.  Plaintiff Lowell also brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief on her \nown behalf and on behalf of a subclass consisting of all persons similarly situated and all \nresidents in and visitors to New York City with mobility disabilities who have been and are \ncurrently being discriminated against by Defendant’s actions and omissions as alleged herein.  \n(“New York City Subclass”) \n116.  The class Plaintiffs seek to represent consists of all people with mobility \ndisabilities who are residents in or visitors to any and all cities and regions serviced by Lyft who \nrequire wheelchair accessible vehicles for vehicular transportation, and who want to, but have \nbeen deterred from, signing up for Lyft’s transportation network because it does not provide \nequal service to people who require wheelchair accessible vehicles. \n117.  The New York State Subclass Plaintiff Lowell seeks to represent consists of all \npeople with mobility disabilities who are residents in or visitors to any and all cities and regions \nlocated in New York State serviced by Lyft who require wheelchair accessible vehicles for \nvehicular transportation, and who want to but have been deterred from signing up for Lyft’s \ntransportation network because it does not provide equal service to people who require \nwheelchair accessible vehicles. \n118.  The New York City Subclass Plaintiff Lowell seeks to represent consists of all \npeople with mobility disabilities who are residents in or visitors to New York City who require \nwheelchair accessible vehicles for vehicular transportation, and who want to but have been \ndeterred from signing up for Lyft’s transportation network because it does not provide equal \nservice to people who require wheelchair accessible vehicles. \n{00289358  }  19 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 20 of 29\n \n119.  The persons in the class and subclasses are so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers of the class is impracticable and the disposition of their claims in a class action is a \nbenefit to the parties and the Court. \n120.  There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact \ninvolved affecting the parties to be represented, in that Plaintiff WDOMI’s members and \nindividuals in the class and subclasses will continue to be denied access to Lyft’s transportation \nservice because of its lack of accessible riders. \n121.  Common questions of law and fact predominate, including the question of \nwhether Defendant’s failure to provide accessible vehicles discriminates against individuals with \nmobility disabilities in violation of the ADA, NYSHRL, and/or NYCHRL. \n122.  Plaintiffs’ claims, and the claims of WDOMI’s members, are typical and are not \nin conflict with the interests of the class or subclass as a whole.  Defendant’s course of conduct \nand violation of the law as alleged herein has caused Plaintiffs and the class and subclass \nmembers to be deprived of their rights under the ADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL.  Therefore, all \nclass members and subclass members will suffer the same or similar injuries for the purpose of \nthe injunctive and declaratory relief sought.  Plaintiffs’ claims are thereby representative of an \nco-extensive with the claims of the class and subclasses.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nrepresent and protect the interests of the class. \n123.  The attorneys representing the class are well qualified and experienced in class \naction litigation.  Counsel are qualified to fully prosecute this litigation on behalf of Plaintiffs \nand the class and subclasses, and possess adequate resources to see this matter through to \nresolution. \n{00289358  }  20 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 21 of 29\n \n124.  Defendant has acted and failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the class \nas a whole, thereby making appropriate finale declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I – DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION \nOF TITLE III OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILTIES ACT \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff And The Nationwide Class) \n125.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n126.  Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full \nand equal enjoyment of specified public transportation services provided by private entities \nprimarily engaged in the business of transporting people and whose operations affect commerce.  \n42 U.S.C. § 12184. \n127.  Plaintiff Lowell, members of WDOMI, and members of the nationwide class are \nall persons with disabilities, i.e., physical impairments that substantially limit one or more major \nlife activities.  42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). \n128.  Defendant is an entity primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. \n129.  Defendant provides specified public transportation services within the meaning of \nthe term under Title III of the ADA on a regular and continuing basis. \n130.  Defendant’s operations affect interstate commerce, including by providing \ntransportation across state lines from New York to New Jersey and vice versa. \n131.  Title III of the ADA also prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the \nfull and equal enjoyment of services provided by places of public accommodations.  42 U.S.C. § \n12182.  Public accommodations, under the ADA, explicitly include travel services.  42 U.S.C. § \n12181(7)(f) \n{00289358  }  21 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 22 of 29\n \n132.  Defendant operates a public accommodation subject to Title III’s non-\ndiscrimination requirements.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12181, 12182. \n133.  Defendant operates a “travel service” as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12181. \n134.  Defendant operates a “demand responsive system” as defined by 42 U.S.C. § \n12181(3). \n135.  Through its ongoing policies and procedures, the opportunities that Lyft offers \npeople with mobility disabilities to participate in or benefit from it services, advantages, and \naccommodations are not equal to the opportunities that Lyft provides to other individuals.  49 \nU.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii). \n136.  By failing to make wheelchair accessible vehicles adequately available through its \ntransportation services, Defendant denies individual who use motorized and other non-folding \nwheelchairs, including Plaintiff Lowell, WDOMI members, and class members, full and equal \nenjoyment of Defendant’s services in violation of Title III of the ADA. \n137.  By forcing users of motorized and other non-folding wheelchairs to wait \nsignificantly longer to obtain rides from wheelchair-accessible vehicles than other users wait to \nobtain rides through its transportation services, Defendant denies such individuals, including \nPlaintiff Lowell, WDOMI members, and class members, full and equal enjoyment of \nDefendant’s services in violation of Title III of the ADA. \n138.  By failing to make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and \nprocedures to make wheelchair accessible vehicles available with equivalent reliability and \nsimilar wait times as inaccessible vehicles, Defendant denies users of motorized and other non-\nfolding wheelchairs, including Plaintiff Plaintiff Lowell, WDOMI members, and class members, \n{00289358  }  22 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 23 of 29\n \nfull and equal enjoyment of Defendant’s transportation service in violation of Title III of the \nADA. \n139.  Plaintiffs, WDOMI members, and members of the nationwide class have been \ninjured by Defendant’s unlawful conduct in violation of Title III of the ADA. \n140.  Defendant’s conduct constitutes an ongoing and continuing violation of the ADA \nand, unless restrained from doing so, Defendant will continue to violate the ADA.  Said conduct \nhas injured Plaintiff and members of the nationwide class, and, unless enjoined, will continue to \ninflict injuries for which Plaintiff and class members have no adequate remedy at law. \nCOUNT II – DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION IN  \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK STATE HUMAN RIGHTS LAW \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff Lowell And The New York State Subclass) \n141.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n142.  The NYSHRL provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for \nany person being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent or employee of \nany place of public accommodation . . . [b]ecause of the . . . disability . . . of any person, directly \nor indirectly to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person any of the accommodations, \nadvantages, facilities or privileges thereof.”  N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(a).  \n143.  Plaintiff Lowell and all members of the New York State subclass are all \n“persons,” as defined under N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(1), with “disabilities,” as defined under N.Y. \nExec. Law § 292(21).   \n144.  The term “place of public accommodation” encompasses “all public conveyances \noperated on land or water or in the air.”  N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(9). \n145.  Defendant is an “owner” or “proprietor” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n146.  Defendant also acts as a “manager” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n{00289358  }  23 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 24 of 29\n \n147.  Defendant is a “person” within N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(1). \n148.  Through its pervasive operations in providing on-demand transportation services \nto the general public and to residents and visitors of cities and regions throughout New York \nState, Defendant provides public conveyances to the public as defined in N.Y. Exec. Law § 292 \n(9). \n149.  Defendant’s deliberate failure to equip its vehicles and/or to require its drivers to \noperate accessible vehicles for the benefit of persons with disabilities requesting its services is an \nunlawful and prohibited discriminatory practice. \n150.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the NYSHRL, \nPlaintiff and members of the New York State Subclass have been injured as set forth herein. \nCOUNT III – DENIAL OF FULL AND EQUAL ENJOYMENT IN  \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK CITY HUMAN RIGHTS LAW \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff Lowell And The New York City Subclass) \n151.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n152.  The NYCHRL provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for \nany person who is the owner, franchisor, franchisee, lessor, lessee, proprietor, manager, \nsuperintendent, agent or employee of any place or provider of public accommodation . . . \n[b]ecause of any person’s actual or perceived . . . disability . . . directly or indirectly . . . [t]o \nrefuse, withhold from or deny to such person the full and equal enjoyment, on equal terms and \nconditions, of any of the accommodations, advantages, services, facilities or privileges of the \nplace or provider of public accommodation.”  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(4)(a).  The \nNYCHRL further prohibits any form of communication that services are not fully and equally \navailable on account of disability. \n{00289358  }  24 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 25 of 29\n \n153.  Plaintiff Lowell and all members of the New York City subclass are all “persons,” \nas defined under N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(1), with “disabilities,” as defined under N.Y.C. \nAdmin. Code § 8-102(16)(a).   \n154.  The term “place or provider of public accommodation” encompasses “providers, \nwhether licensed or unlicensed, of goods, services, facilities, accommodations, advantages or \nprivileges of any kind, and places whether licensed or unlicensed, where goods services, \nfacilities, accommodations, advantages or privileges of any kind are extended, offered, sold or \notherwise made available.”  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(9). \n155.  Transportation services that are provided to the public, including Lyft, constitute a \nservice, accommodation, advantage, or privilege that is offered to the general public within the \nmeaning of N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(9). \n156.  Defendant is an “owner” or “proprietor” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n157.  Defendant also acts as a “manager” of Lyft’s transportation services. \n158.  Defendant is a “person” within N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(1). \n159.  The services, accommodations, advantages, and privileges that Defendant makes \navailable to the general public are such that Defendant, in its role as the Lyft transportation \nsystem’s owner, proprietor, and/or manager, violates N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(4)(a). \n160.  Defendant’s violations of the NYCHRL are particularly grave in light of the \nuniquely remedial purpose behind the NYCHRL, which provides that each section must be \n“construed liberally for the accomplishment of the uniquely broad and remedial purposes \nthereof, regardless of whether federal or New York state civil and human rights laws, including \nthose laws with provisions worded comparably to provisions of this title, have been so \nconstrued.”  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-130. \n{00289358  }  25 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 26 of 29\n \n161.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the NYCHRL, \nPlaintiff Lowell and members of the New York City Subclass have been injured as set forth \nherein. \nCOUNT IV – DISPARATE IMPACT IN  \nVIOLATION OF THE NEW YORK CITY HUMAN RIGHTS LAW \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiff Lowell And The New York City Subclass) \n162.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n163.  Defendant’s conduct also violates N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(17), which states \nthat “an unlawful discriminatory practice . . . is established . . . [when a plaintiff] demonstrates \nthat a policy or practice of a covered entity or group of policies or practices of a covered entity \nresults in a disparate impact to the detriment of any group protected by the provisions of this \nchapter.” \n164.  By failing to operate its transportation service so that it is readily accessible and \nusable by people who use wheelchairs when viewed in its entirety, Defendant has demonstrated a \npolicy or practice that has a disproportionately negative impact on Plaintiff Lowell and members \nof the proposed class, each of whom qualifies as a member of a protected group under the \nprovisions of the NYCHRL. \n165.  In particular, as described herein, Lyft’s use of a separate Access Mode for its \nsmartphone application ensures that customers who require wheelchair accessible vehicles are \neither denied service from Lyft altogether, and instead directed to other, less-convenient \nproviders, or are subjected to significantly longer wait times given the lack of wheelchair \naccessible vehicles in Lyft’s own fleet. \n{00289358  }  26 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-NSR-LMS   Document 20   Filed 12/06/17   Page 27 of 29\n \n166.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s violations of the NYCHRL, \nPlaintiff Lowell and members of the New York City Subclass have been injured as set forth \nherein. \nCOUNT V – DECLARATORY RELIEF \n(On Behalf Of Plaintiffs And Nationwide Class) \n167.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n168.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the Parties in that \nPlaintiffs contend, and are informed and believe that Defendant denies, that Defendant has \ndiscriminated against the class by failing to adopt policies and procedures that would provide \npeople with mobility disabilities who require wheelchair accessible vehicles with full and equal \nenjoyment, on equal terms and conditions, of the services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \naccommodations of Lyft’s transportation services. \n169.  Defendant fails to comply with applicable laws, including but not limited to the \nADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. \n170.

HALPERN, United States District Judge: \nBefore the Court is Magistrate Judge Andrew E. Krause’s December 22, 2022 Report and \nRecommendation (“Report”) recommending that the Court grant in part and deny in part the \nmotion for class certification filed by Harriet Lowell (“Lowell”) and Westchester Disabled on the \nMove, Inc. (“WDOMI,” and together, “Plaintiffs”), and certify three proposed classes.1 (Doc. 340, \n“R&R”).  \nObjections to the Report, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 72(b), were due on January 5, 2023. On December 23, 2022, Lyft, Inc. (“Defendant”) \nsought, and the Court granted, an extension of time to file objections. (Docs. 341, 342). Defendant \nfiled its objections on January 19, 2023 (Doc. 350, “Obj.”) and, after an additional extension was \ngranted, Plaintiff’s response thereto was filed on February 16, 2023 (Doc. 358, “Resp.”; see also \nDocs. 359-361).2 The Court also permitted the filing of a brief by Amici Curiae, Association of \n \n1 By Order dated January 25, 2019, Judge Nelson S. Román—to whom this case was assigned prior to its \nreassignment to this Court on April 3, 2020—referred this case to the assigned Magistrate Judge for general \npretrial purposes. (Doc. 55). On March 14, 2022, this Court entered an Amended Order referring the class \ncertification motion specifically to Magistrate Judge Krause. (Doc. 200). \n \n2 Plaintiff filed a request to seal in connection with its response to Defendant’s objections. (Doc. 357). The \nCourt grants the request such that the redacted documents filed on the public docket (Docs. 358, 359) will \nremain the publicly-filed versions and the unredacted versions (Docs. 360, 361) will remain under seal. \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 2 of 25\nPrograms for Rural Independent Living, the National Council on Independent Living, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, and United Spinal Association, which was filed on February 23, 2023. (Doc. \n362).  \nThe Court, in reviewing a magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, “may accept, \nreject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate \njudge.” 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). Parties may object to a report and recommendation “[w]ithin \nfourteen days after being served with a copy . . . .” Id. “A party that objects to a report and \nrecommendation must point out the specific portions of the report and recommendation to which \nthey object.” J.P.T. Auto., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 659 F. Supp. 2d 350, 352 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2009). If a party timely objects to the findings or recommendations of the magistrate \njudge, the court must “make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified \nproposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.” United States v. Male Juvenile \n(95-CR-1074), 121 F.3d 34, 38 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)). If a party fails to \nobject to a particular portion of a report and recommendation, further review thereof is generally \nprecluded. Clemmons v. Lee, No. 13-CV-04969, 2022 WL 255737, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2022) \n(citing Mario v. P & C Food Mkts., Inc., 313 F.3d 758, 766 (2d Cir. 2002)). The district court “may \nadopt those portions of the report to which no ‘specific, written objection’ is made, as long as the \nfactual and legal bases supporting the findings and conclusions set forth in those sections are not \nclearly erroneous or contrary to law.” Id. (internal citation omitted).  \nANALYSIS \nDefendant  challenges  Magistrate  Judge  Krause’s  findings  and  recommendations \nconcerning Plaintiffs’ standing as to their claims regarding the Non-Access Regions3 and the Rule \n \n3 Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Report. \n2 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 3 of 25\n23 requirements for class certification, urging this Court to reject the Report and enter judgment \nin its favor based on Plaintiffs’ failure to establish Article III standing. Underscoring each of \nDefendant’s  specific  objections,  as  framed  by  Defendant,  are  two  alleged  general  errors \npermeating the Report: (1) “accepting the false equivalence” proffered by Plaintiffs between \naccess to a feature in the app with access to transportation (Obj. at 3-5); and (2) presuming that the \nact of discrimination in this case is the failure to provide WAV service (Obj. at 5-7). The Court \ndisagrees with each of Defendant’s depictions of the Report.  \nAs to the first issue, Magistrate Judge Krause did not conflate access to the app with access \nto transportation. He simply recognized that drivers cannot offer WAV services without Defendant \nfirst making that option available in the Non-Access Regions. Whether the categorical preclusion, \nbecause of Defendant’s policies, practices, and procedures, of WAV service in Non-Access \nRegions violates the ADA goes to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claim and is simply an inappropriate \ninquiry on this motion for class certification.  \nAs to the second issue, Magistrate Judge Krause clearly identified Plaintiffs’ allegations of \ndiscrimination, quoting from the operative pleading: “violation of Title III of the ADA, which \nprohibits discrimination ‘on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of specified \npublic transportation services provided by a private entity that is primarily engaged in the business \nof transporting people and whose operations affect commerce’ . . . [and] that ‘[b]y failing to make \nreasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and procedures to make [WAVs] available with \nequivalent reliability and similar wait times as inaccessible vehicles, Defendant denies users of \nmotorized and other non-folding wheelchairs, including Plaintiff . . . Lowell, WDOMI members, \nand class members, full and equal enjoyment of Defendant’s transportation service in violation of \nTitle III of the ADA.’” (R&R 35-36 (quoting Am. Compl. ¶¶ 126, 138)). This accurate depiction \n3 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 4 of 25\nof the case did not constitute error and is certainly not—as Defendant suggests—a lone failure to \nprovide WAV service. \nThe Court considers those two claimed errors to the extent Defendant has raised them as \ninfecting the more specific challenged findings and recommendations in the Report. Each of the \nspecific objections raised by Defendant is addressed below. \nI.  Standing \nDefendant objects to Magistrate Judge Krause’s legal analysis and ultimate conclusion \nconcerning Plaintiffs’ constitutional standing to maintain this action, arguing that Plaintiffs failed \nto satisfy the injury in fact and redressability requirements of standing. Caselaw interpreting \nArticle III of the United States Constitution, as Magistrate Judge Krause correctly explained, \nrequires a plaintiff to satisfy three elements to establish standing. (R&R at 8 (citing Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). “First, the plaintiff must have suffered an ‘injury in \nfact’—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \n‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal citations \nomitted) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)). Second, the plaintiff must \nshow “a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of . . . .” Id. at 560 \n(citing Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976)). Third, it must be likely \nthat a favorable judicial decision will redress the injury. Id. at 561.  Defendant’s objection concerns \nthe first and third elements: the existence of an injury in fact and redressability. \nA.  Injury in Fact \nThe Second Circuit, “[i]n the ADA context, [has] held that a plaintiff seeking injunctive \nrelief has suffered an injury in fact when: ‘(1) the plaintiff alleged past injury under the ADA; (2) \nit was reasonable to infer that the discriminatory treatment would continue; and (3) it was \n4 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 5 of 25\nreasonable  to  infer,  based  on  the  past  frequency  of  plaintiff’s  visits  and  the  proximity  of \ndefendants’  [businesses]  to  plaintiff’s  home,  that  plaintiff  intended  to  return  to  the  subject \nlocation.” Calcano v. Swarovski N. Am. Ltd., 36 F.4th 68, 74 (2d Cir. 2022) (quoting Kreisler v. \nSecond Ave. Diner Corp., 731 F.3d 184, 187-88 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing Camarillo v. Carrols Corp., \n518 F.3d 153, 158 (2d Cir. 2008))).  \n“Courts in the Second Circuit have expanded upon the first and third elements of this \n[injury in fact] test.” Castillo v. John Gore Org., Inc., No. 19-CV-00388, 2019 WL 6033088, at \n*3 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2019). With respect to the first element, “[t]he Second Circuit has been \nunambiguous that . . . ‘deterrence’ can constitute a past injury.” (Obj. at 23 (citing Kreisler, 731 \nF.3d at 188)). “Thus, if a plaintiff has not ‘personally encounter[ed]’ a barrier to access, she has \nnonetheless suffered an injury if she had ‘actual knowledge of the barrier complained of and has \nbeen deterred from visiting the public accommodation because of that barrier.’” Castillo, 2019 WL \n6033088, at *3 (quoting Perdum v. Forest City Ratner Cos., 174 F. Supp. 3d 706, 714-15 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2016), aff’d, 677 F. App’x 2 (2d Cir. 2017)).4  \nThe third element of the injury in fact test—which is the subject of Defendant’s objection— \nis that it must be “reasonable to infer . . . that plaintiff intended to return to the subject location.” \nCalcano, 36 F.4th at 74. Courts in this Circuit have linked the third element—intent to return—to \nthe constitutional requirement that an injury in fact be imminent, rather than conjectural or \n \n4 This test, sometimes referred to as the “deterrence effect” doctrine, has also been linked in the ADA \ncontext to the text of the statute itself, which states that a person with a disability does not need “to engage \nin a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this subchapter \ndoes not intend to comply with its provisions.” 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1). Indeed, at the motion to dismiss \nstage in this case, Judge Román applied the deterrence effect test to Plaintiffs’ allegations, invoking the \n“futile gesture” language of the statute to govern analysis of the injury in fact requirement of constitutional \nstanding. See Lowell v. Lyft, Inc., 352 F. Supp. 3d 248, 255 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). Putting aside whether the \ndeterrence effect doctrine and ADA text are synonymous, interchangeable, or distinct, the result remains \nthe same under either articulation. \n5 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 6 of 25\nhypothetical. Castillo, 2019 WL 6033088, at *4 (citing Feltzin v. Stone Equities, LLC, No. 16-CV-\n06457, 2018 WL 1115135, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2018), adopted by, 2018 WL 1114682 \n(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2018)); see, e.g., Calcano, 36 F.4th at 74-75 (“[T]he focus of the third factor—\ni.e., intent to return based on past visits and proximity—is to ensure that ‘the risk of harm is \nsufficiently  imminent  and  substantial’  to  establish  standing.”  (quoting  TransUnion  LLC  v. \nRamirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2210 (2021))); Harty v. W. Point Realty, Inc., 28 F.4th 435, 443 (2d Cir. \n2022). \nThe Second Circuit, in 2013, considered in Kreisler whether the plaintiff had standing to \npursue an ADA case against a diner where a wheelchair bound plaintiff never attempted to enter \nthe diner because the seven to eight-inch step deterred him from attempting to enter. 731 F.3d 184, \n188. The Circuit drew from its prior decision in Camarillo, 518 F.3d 153, and “adopt[ed] the Ninth \nCircuit’s ruling in Pickern” to hold that “deterrence constitutes an injury under the ADA.” \nKreisler, 731 F.3d at 188 (citing Pickern v. Holiday Quality Foods Inc., 293 F.3d 1133, 1137-38 \n(9th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he fact that the wheelchair-inaccessible entrance deterred [the plaintiff] from \naccessing the Diner established a concrete and particularized injury; [the plaintiff] need not attempt \nto overcome an obvious barrier.”)). The Ninth Circuit, in Pickern, had held that “in stating that he \nis currently deterred from attempting to gain access to the [defendant’s] store, [the plaintiff] has \nstated sufficient facts to show concrete, particularized injury.” Pickern, 293 F.3d at 1137-38.  \nBy “adopt[ing] the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in Pickern,” Kreisler may have created some \nuncertainty, because in Pickern, in addition to holding that deterrence can satisfy the past injury \nelement, the court also held that: \n[A] plaintiff who is threatened with harm in the future because of \nexisting or imminently threatened non-compliance with the ADA \nsuffers “imminent injury.” [Plaintiff] has visited [defendant’s] store \nin the past and states that he has actual knowledge of the barriers to \n6 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 7 of 25\naccess at that store. [Plaintiff] also states that he prefers to shop at \n[defendant’s] markets and that he would shop at the [defendant’s] \nmarket if it were accessible. This is sufficient to establish actual or \nimminent injury for purposes of standing.”  \n \nPickern, 293 F.3d at 1138. The Second Circuit in Kreisler, however, appears only to have adopted \nPickern to the extent its holding bore on the first element—past injury—but not to the extent that \nPickern can be read to endorse the deterrence effect doctrine as a substitute for the third element—\nintent to return. \nIt appears that since Pickern, the Ninth Circuit’s ADA jurisprudence in this area has \nevolved concerning deterrence and future injury: “[A] plaintiff must establish a sufficient future \ninjury  by  alleging  that  they  are  either  currently  deterred  from  visiting  the  place  of  public \naccommodation because of a barrier, or that they were previously deterred and that they intend to \nreturn to the place of public accommodation, where they are likely to reencounter the barrier.” \nLanger v. Kiser, 57 F.4th 1085, 1094 (9th Cir. 2023) (internal citations omitted). Clearly, in the \nNinth Circuit, the deterrence effect of a barrier is one way to establish a future injury.  \nThe Second Circuit’s jurisprudence since Kreisler has evolved as well, maintaining its \ntether to the “intent to return” element of the injury in fact requirement.  Calcano, 36 F.4th at 75 \n(“[I]ntent to return is neither new nor is it an additional requirement—it is how our Court has \ndetermined whether a plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of future injury for injunctive \nrelief.”); see also Harty v. Greenwich Hosp. Grp., LLC, 536 F. App’x 154, 155 n.1 (2d Cir. 2013) \n(“Assuming, arguendo, that under Kreisler, [plaintiff] does not need to demonstrate an intention \nto return to the Hampton Inn in Stamford, Connecticut, but rather must allege that he is deterred \nfrom staying there, his complaint and affidavit must still give rise to ‘a reasonable inference that \nhe would frequent [the Inn] were the violation remedied.’” (quoting Kreisler, 731 F.3d at 188)). \nThe Second Circuit in Calcano further elaborated on the intent to return element, explaining that \n7 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 8 of 25\n“the central inquiry is . . . if, ‘examined under the “totality of all relevant facts,”’ the plaintiff \nplausibly alleges ‘a real and immediate threat of future injury.” 36 F.4th at 75.  \nDefendant, citing to the 2022 Calcano and Harty decisions, argues that Magistrate Judge \nKrause “disregarded recent Second Circuit authority in favor of a D.C. district court opinion to \nhold that ‘in the context of the ADA . . . the plaintiff need not establish that he or she would have \notherwise actually or imminently visited and/or patronized a place with [access] barriers,’ but \ninstead, ‘a plaintiff must simply allege that he or she has become aware of discriminatory \nconditions existing at a public accommodation, and is thereby deterred from visiting or patronizing \nthat accommodation.’” (Obj. at 23 (citing R&R at 11 (quoting Equal Rts. Ctr. v. Uber Techs., Inc., \n525 F. Supp. 3d 62, 76 (D.D.C. 2021)))). The gravamen of Defendant’s objection is that Plaintiffs \nfailed to demonstrate a “plausible intent” to use Defendant’s service in the future, thereby failing \nto establish that the risk of harm is sufficiently imminent and substantial so as “to ‘pursue forward-\nlooking, injunctive relief.’” (Id. (quoting Calcano, 36 F.4th at 72)). \nDefendant’s objection concerning injury in fact thus concerns the third element of the test: \nwhether Plaintiffs have established “sufficient facts to show a plausible intention” to return to the \noffending location or, in this case, to use Defendant’s service. A plaintiff cannot merely “plead[ ] \nthe magic words that [she] intends to return” but must instead establish “a real and immediate \nthreat of future injury.” Calcano, 36 F.4th at 75; see also Tavarez-Vargas v. Annie’s Publishing, \nLLC, No. 21-CV-09862, 2023 WL 2499966, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2023) (“other courts in this \ndistrict have concluded that the Second Circuit’s recent decision in Calcano ‘raised the bar \nappreciably for adequately pleading standing to seek injunctive relief in ADA cases’” (quoting \n8 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 9 of 25\nLoadholt v. Dungarees, Inc., No. 22-CV-04699, 2023 WL 2024792, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, \n2023))).5 \nWhether Magistrate Judge Krause substituted the deterrence effect doctrine for plausible \nproof of intent to return, as Defendant argues, is a red herring. Notwithstanding the comment that \n“a plaintiff must simply allege that he or she has become aware of discriminatory conditions \nexisting at a public accommodation, and is thereby deterred from visiting or patronizing that \naccommodation” to establish standing (R&R at 11), Magistrate Judge Krause actually utilized both \nthe Ninth Circuit’s approach in Pickern (and the District Court for the District of Columbia in \nEqual Rts. Ctr. v. Uber Techs., Inc.), as well as the Second Circuit’s approach in Kreisler, Harty, \nand Calcano when he analyzed Plaintiff’s evidence concerning Lowell’s “intent to return.”  (R&R \nat 16-17) (“Moreover, Lowell has expressed an intention to use the Lyft app once it offers WAV \nservice in Westchester County.” (quoting Doc. 290, “Lowell Decl.”))).  \nMagistrate Judge Krause correctly noted that “since it would have been a ‘futile gesture’ \nfor Lowell to have downloaded and tried to use the Lyft app in the first instance, it is manifest that \nshe never ‘visited’ the app and thus could not have an intent to return to it. Rather, the risk of \nimminent future harm to Lowell is based on the continued lack of WAV service available on Lyft’s \napp in the Non-Access Regions.” (R&R at 16). That statement did not, as Defendant suggests, \nconvert this case into a case about its app. Neither Magistrate Judge Krause nor this Court \nconstrues Plaintiffs’ claims to concern unequal access to an app, but rather that Defendant failed \n \n5 A named plaintiff, at the class certification stage, must prove standing by a preponderance of the evidence. \nCalvo v. City of New York, No. 14-CV-07246, 2017 WL 4231431, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2017); see also \nCarter v. HealthPort Techs., LLC, 822 F.3d 47, 56 (2d Cir. 2016) (“‘[E]ach element must be supported in \nthe same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and \ndegree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.’ . . . Thus, the showing that must be \nmade in order to withstand a dismissal for lack of standing increases as the suit proceeds.” (quoting Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561)). \n9 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 10 of 25\nto make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and procedures that are necessary to \nafford on-demand WAV service.  \nThe Court, in considering the future injury element, is constrained to analogize the caselaw \nconcerning “intent to return based on past visits and proximity” to the instant scenario. Clearly, \nthe facts of this case do not line up with the extant Second Circuit caselaw because this case does \nnot concern a plaintiff’s “return” to a building, or a restaurant, or a hotel, or a website. Here, rather, \nthe Court must examine whether Plaintiffs “plausibly allege[ ] a real and immediate threat of future \ninjury,” Calcano, 36 F.4th at 75, as it relates to their use of Defendant’s transportation services. \nThe Court’s inquiry, in other words, is whether Plaintiffs have shown that it is more likely than \nnot, based upon the evidence in the record, that they, who were previously deterred from using \nDefendant’s transportation services, intend to use Defendant’s services in the future, should \nDefendant’s alleged policies, practices, and procedures be remedied.

Golden China of Red Wing, Inc., 987 F.3d 1205, \n1209 (8th Cir. 2021) (“In the ADA context, plaintiffs need not engage in the ‘futile gesture’ of visiting a \nbuilding containing known barriers that the owner has no intention of remedying, but they must at least \nprove knowledge of the barriers and that they would visit the building in the imminent future but for those \nbarriers.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Mosley v.

Plaintiffs offered Lowell’s declaration and \ntestimony to establish her intention to use Defendant’s transportation services in the future, should \nWAV service be made available in Westchester County. Based upon its own review, this Court \nfinds that Lowell established “sufficient facts to show a plausible intention” to use Defendant’s \ntransportation service in the future so as to satisfy the third element of the injury in fact requirement \nof standing. (Lowell Decl. ¶ 10 (“I would use Lyft for transportation in Westchester County but \ncannot do so as Lyft does not offer WAV service in Westchester County.”); ¶ 15 (“I would like to \ntravel to New York City more often but, unfortunately, I am limited by inadequate transportation \noptions because Westchester County’s ParaTransit service does not extend to New York City, \npublic transportation options between Westchester and New York City are largely inaccessible, \nand private taxicabs are significantly more expensive than Lyft.”); ¶ 16 (“I would have used Lyft’s \nservices to visit my husband in the hospital but for my knowledge that Lyft does not offer services \nto mobility-impaired individuals.”); ¶ 18 (“If I had reliable access to Lyft’s transportation services, \nI would travel to, from, and around New York City more often.”);  ¶ 23 (“If Lyft were ADA-\ncompliant and provided reliable access to me and my motorized scooter, I would be eager to use \nits services.”); Doc. 301-5, “Lowell Tr.” at 111:2-7 (“I would use [Lyft] . . . if I went into the City \nand I had no reason to bring my husband. I would use it locally.”); 111:19-112:1 (“I might visit a \nfriend. I might go to a museum or some other event like that. Things we don’t have here. I might \nwant to go to the park.”); 138:6-8 (“I would love to use Lyft. It would be great to use it in White \n11 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 12 of 25\nPlains. It would be extremely helpful, you know.”); 149:1-15 (“I would like to be able to go to \nappointments. I would like to be able to go to disability events, which are in the area in \nWestchester. I would like to visit my best friend in the City. I would like to go to a medical \nappointment on my own. I would like to go out to dinner with somebody in the City or a concert, \nyou know, or any number of events. I would like to be able to use Lyft in an emergency for myself \nor my husband or a friend or someone close to me. I would like that freedom for the same reason \nthere is Lyft, for the same reason there are services like taxis.”)).  \nContrary  to  Defendant’s  objections,  these  facts  are  sufficient  to  demonstrate,  by  a \npreponderance of the evidence, Lowell’s plausible intention to imminently use Defendant’s \ntransportation service in the future should its policies, practices, and procedures be modified. \nDefendant argues that Lowell’s stated intention to use Lyft in the future is “implausible given her \nadmissions that she has never used a WAV taxi, or even Uber WAV, in any location, including \nNew York City.” (Obj. at 24-25). Defendant is essentially arguing that Lowell’s sworn statements \nare not credible in light of her past conduct. The Court need not determine whether Lowell’s past \npractices are a predictor of future conduct. At this juncture in the case, Lowell’s testimony that she \nwould  use  Defendant’s  services  if  its  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  were  modified  is \nsufficient. \nDefendant also challenges WDOMI’s standing based upon the same predicate argument. \nPlaintiffs submitted, as Defendant acknowledges, declarations of WDOMI’s members who seek \nto  use  Defendant’s  transportation  services  in  the  future.  (See,  e.g.,  Doc.  287-2  at  2,  4  (“I \noccasionally use ParaTransit and traditional taxi services to travel. These services require that I \nschedule rides hours or even a full day in advance, and prevent me from spontaneous travel. . . . If \nLyft was ADA-compliant and was to accommodate me and my motorized wheelchair, I would be \n12 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 13 of 25\neager to use its services.”); id. at 6 (“Access to Lyft would undoubtedly facilitate my travel around \nthe Tri-State Area. There are many instances when I would use Lyft if it were to provide accessible \nservices. For example, I enjoy going to dinner, movies, and concerts with my friends. We often go \nout in Westchester, New York City, and Hoboken, NJ. Because there are virtually no affordable, \nreliable, and accessible transportation services available, it is very difficult for me to travel to and \nfrom such destinations.”)). This Court finds, for substantially the same reasons as it did with \nLowell, that WDOMI has sufficiently demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, its \nconstituents’ plausible intention to use Defendant’s transportation service in the future. \nAccordingly, the Court adopts Magistrate Judge Krause’s finding that Plaintiffs have \nestablished an injury in fact. \nB.  Redressability \nMagistrate Judge Krause concluded that Plaintiffs established redressability upon a finding \nthat “[a]t least certain elements of the injunctive relief that Plaintiffs seek–for example, removing \nthe categorical block of WAVs on the Lyft platform in the Non-Access Regions . . . would be \nredressed if there were a favorable decision in this litigation.” (R&R at 19). Defendant objects to \nthis conclusion, arguing that “Plaintiffs rely on speculation, not evidence, to claim that changes to \nLyft’s App would result in WAV rides.” 7 (Obj. at 12). Defendant’s objection misses the mark. \nThe issue is not whether the design of Defendant’s app is the cause of Plaintiff’s injury. Rather, \nPlaintiffs’ contention is that they are injured “because Lyft prohibits any WAV service through \nthe App in the Non-Access Regions.” (Resp. at 14).  \n \n7 Defendant, in a footnote, objects to Magistrate Judge Krause’s July 5, 2022 decision denying its request \nto file a Daubert motion to exclude Plaintiffs’ expert’s opinions for the purposes of class certification. (Obj. \nat 14 n.3). This Court rejects any such objection to that decision as untimely under Rule 72(a).  \n13 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 14 of 25\nDefendant’s  drivers  cannot  offer  WAV  services  without  Defendant  first  revising  its \npolicies, practices, and procedures to make that option available in the Non-Access Regions. (See \nid. n.6 (citing Doc. 287-14 at 118:12-15 (transcript of Defendant’s designated Rule 30(b)(6) \nwitness, testifying that WAV drivers cannot appear as WAVs in non-Access Regions); id. at 120:1-\n6 (“Q: So in other regions of the country, where Lyft drivers have WAV-accessible vehicles, there \nis no way for that information to be made known to drivers -- to passengers who would require a \nWAV vehicle? A: That is correct.”); Doc. 287-8 at 242:22-25 (transcript of Defendant’s designated \nRule 30(b)(6) witness, testifying as follows: “Q: In all the markets where Lyft operates that are not \naccess markets, Lyft does not provide rides for people who require WAV[s]? A: I guess that’s \ncorrect, yes.”))).  \n“That  another  cause  may  exist  for  Plaintiffs’  alleged  injuries—the  possibility  that \n[Defendant’s] drivers will not drive [WAVs]—does not change that conclusion.” Namisnak v. \nUber Techs., Inc., 971 F.3d 1088, 1094 (9th Cir. 2020). In other words, and as the Report \nconcluded, at least some of the specific relief requested by Plaintiffs would be redressed by a \nfavorable  decision  herein,  and  therefore,  the  Court  adopts  Magistrate  Judge  Krause’s \nrecommendation  that  Plaintiffs  have  established  redressability.  Plaintiffs  have  therefore \nestablished Article III standing and Defendant’s request to enter judgment in its favor for lack of \nstanding is denied. \nII.  Class Definitions \nThe Court, having determined that Magistrate Judge Krause correctly found that Plaintiffs \nhave constitutional standing to maintain this action, rejects Defendant’s contention that the Report \nrecommends certification of classes that include individuals who lack constitutional standing. \nBecause the Court has found that Plaintiffs established standing, “that is enough to confer standing \n14 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 15 of 25\non the entire class.” Hyland v. Navient Corp., 48 F.4th 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2022) (citing Amador v. \nAndrews, 655 F.3d 89, 99 (2d Cir. 2011)). Indeed, there is no requirement that Plaintiffs establish \nthe standing of all members of each proposed class to be certified. See id. at 117-18; Denney v. \nDeutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 263-64 (2d Cir. 2006).8 Defendant specifically argues that the \nclass definitions are overbroad in that they embrace putative members with no connection to \nDefendant such that they have not been injured by Defendant and may never use Defendant’s \nservices in the future. (Obj. at 17-18). That a class member has not yet been injured by Defendant \ndoes not mean the class definition is too broad or that it includes class members without standing. \nThe class definitions here limit membership to those “who are denied equal access to Lyft’s \ntransportation services” meaning, those who are injured by Defendant’s alleged noncompliance \nwith the ADA. This limitation necessarily restricts the proposed classes to only those members \nwho have standing against Defendant through the denial of equal access. \nAlthough modification of the recommended class definitions is not warranted for the \nreasons raised by Defendant, the Court will and does modify the second and third class definitions \nto clarify that WDOMI does not assert claims under the NYSHRL, as Judge Román previously \ndetermined that WDOMI “cannot satisfy all of the elements for organizational standing and cannot \nsatisfy all of the elements for associational standing specifically for its . . . NYSHRL claims.” \nLowell, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 259. \n \n \n \n \n8 The Court rejects Defendant’s characterization of the Report’s analysis of Hyland’s impact on Denney. \n(Obj. at 17-18). Magistrate Judge Krause did not suggest that Hyland overruled Denney. (See R&R at 31-\n32).    \n15 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 16 of 25\nIII.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \nDefendant  objects  to  Magistrate  Judge  Krause’s  findings  concerning  each  of  the \nrequirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), including the implied requirement of \nascertainability, and 23(b)(2). The Court considers each in turn. \nA.  Numerosity \nMagistrate Judge Krause concluded that Plaintiffs satisfied the numerosity requirement of \nRule 23(a) because: (i) statistical data led to a reasonable inference that the number of class \nmembers were substantial; and (ii) declarations of putative class members and amici support a \nfinding of numerosity. (R&R at 37-39). Defendant argues that Magistrate Judge Krause erred in \nthese findings because he “accepted the general statistical data and faulty declarations from \nPlaintiffs to meet their burden in establishing the class size.” (Obj. at 21). Defendant’s objections \nfail to call into question either of these bases for Magistrate Judge Krause’s determination.  \nPlaintiffs need only establish that there are 40 or more members of the putative class for \nthe Court to presume numerosity has been met. Consol. Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d \n473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995). The statistical data from the U.S. Census Bureau relied on by Magistrate \nJudge Krause further establishes that numerosity is met. “Courts within this Circuit have frequently \nrelied on reasonable inferences based on statistical data to establish numerosity.” Westchester \nIndep. Living Ctr., Inc. v. SUNY Purchase, 331 F.R.D. 279, 288-89 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Judge \nFurman, for example, relied on Census Bureau data in Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of the Disabled v. \nBloomberg to “estimate that there are roughly 900,000 people with disabilities in New York City” \nand therefore establish numerosity. 290 F.R.D. 409, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). The data permissibly \nrelied on by Magistrate Judge Krause here shows that the number of class members in each \nproposed class exceeds the threshold amount of 40 more than a hundred times over. Defendant’s \n16 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 17 of 25\nobjection that the statistical estimates of the classes size are overinclusive and therefore speculative \nfails because the proposed classes, even if overinclusive, are not so to the point of defeating \nnumerosity. \nFor the estimates to be so inaccurate that numerosity is not met by the statistics, more than \n99% of the people included in them would have to be excluded. There is no plausible explanation \nfor how the estimates could be so skewed. If class action plaintiffs could use only statistical \nevidence that establishes numerosity by more than a factor of one hundred, they would never be \nable to use statistical evidence and, in any event, there is no requirement that numerosity be \nestablished to a precise number. See Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993) (Courts \ndo not require “evidence of exact class size or identity of class members to satisfy the numerosity \nrequirement.”). The statistical data here establishes to a near certainty that there are more than 40 \nmembers in each proposed class. No more is required. \nIn any event, Plaintiffs submitted hundreds of declarations from putative class members, \nwhich alone would establish a class size sufficient for joinder to be impracticable and numerosity \ntherefore met. Defendant’s objection to the declarations—i.e., that some putative class members \nhave not demonstrated concrete injury—is inapposite for two reasons identified by Magistrate \nJudge Krause: (i) “th[e] percentage of disqualified class members is not so substantial as to \npreclude a finding that Plaintiffs have satisfied the numerosity requirement for each of the \nproposed classes” (R&R at 39 n.20); and (ii) Defendant conflates this argument with their standing \nargument, rejected above (id. at 39).9 \n \n9 The Court notes that Judge Alsup’s decision in Indep. Living Res. Ctr. San Francisco v. Lyft, Inc., No. 19-\nCV-01438, 2020 WL 6802410 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2020), which denied class certification because \nnumerosity was lacking is distinguishable from this case for the simple reason that here, Plaintiffs provided \nsignificantly more than 40 declarations whereas there, plaintiffs had only submitted 25. \n17 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 18 of 25\nAccordingly, the Court adopts Magistrate Krause’s recommendation that Plaintiffs have \nestablished numerosity. \nB.  Commonality \nMagistrate Judge Krause concluded that Plaintiffs satisfied the commonality requirement \nof Rule 23(a) because Plaintiffs “challenge policies and practices that Lyft implements on class-\nwide bases with respect to each of the putative classes, and propose injunctive relief tailored to the \nrespective classes.” (R&R at 41). Magistrate Judge Krause noted that “[w]here, as here, ‘the \nplaintiff class seeks to enjoin a practice or policy, rather than individualized relief, commonality \nis assumed.’” (Id. (quoting Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., 331 F.R.D. at 292)). Defendant objects \nto  this  conclusion,  relying  principally  on  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  and  argues  that \nMagistrate Judge Krause erred by not conducting “a ‘rigorous analysis’ of the elements of \nPlaintiffs’ reasonable modification claim to determine whether a common issue will in fact drive \nthe resolution of their case.” (Obj. at 13 (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 \n(2011))). \nThe instant case is readily distinguishable from Dukes. There, plaintiffs—complaining of \nsex-based pay and promotion disparities—sought to certify a nationwide class of approximately \n1.5 million female Wal-Mart employees without pointing to any nationwide policies or practices \nthat would furnish the “glue holding together” the millions of individual employment decisions \nthat plaintiffs wished to put at issue. Dukes, 564 U.S. at 352. “The only corporate policy” that the \nplaintiffs in Dukes were able to establish was “Wal-Mart’s ‘policy’ of allowing discretion by local \nsupervisors over employment matters.” Id. at 355 (emphasis in the original). Plaintiffs here, in \nstark contrast with Dukes, have established that they were unable to utilize Defendant’s services \nbecause “Lyft has a uniform centralized policy and practice of affirmatively and categorically \n18 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 19 of 25\nprecluding WAV service in all Non-Access Regions.” (R&R at 41 (citing Pls.’ Revised Mem. at \n44)). \nThe present case is, rather, analogous to Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., where Judge Seibel \ncertified  a  class  of  students  and  visitors  with  mobility  disabilities  and  held  that  plaintiffs \nestablished commonality where “the core issue presented is whether Defendants engaged in a \ngeneral course of conduct of not providing accessible paths of travel throughout the campus, \nthereby denying people with mobility disabilities meaningful access.” 331 F.R.D at 293. Plaintiffs \nhere similarly present the core issue of whether Defendant “implements a uniform policy of \npreventing WAV service in the Non-Access Regions.” (Resp. at 19). The answer to this question \n“will resolve all of the class claims.” Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., 331 F.R.D. at 293. \nAccordingly, the Court adopts Magistrate Judge Krause’s recommendation that Plaintiffs \nhave established commonality. \nC.  Typicality \nMagistrate Judge Krause concluded that Plaintiffs satisfied the typicality requirement of \nRule 23(a) because “the ADA claim of each putative class arises from the same course of allegedly \ndiscriminatory  conduct”  and  “each  putative  class  makes  uniform  arguments  regarding  the \nreasonable modifications that Lyft could implement to make its services accessible.” (R&R at 42). \nDefendant argues that Magistrate Judge Krause erred by failing to determine “whether ‘each class \nmember’s  claim’  actually  arises  from  ‘the  same  course  of  events.’”  (Obj.  at  15  (quoting \nWestchester Indep. Living Ctr., 331 F.R.D. at 293)). Defendant further argues that Magistrate \nJudge Krause “compounded his error by presuming that requiring Lyft to modify its App would \nlead to a uniform outcome.” (Id.). \n19 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 20 of 25\nMagistrate  Judge  Krause  did,  contrary  to  Defendant’s  contentions,  determine  that \nPlaintiffs’ claims arose “from a unitary course of conduct by a single system” before concluding \nthat Plaintiffs satisfied the typicality requirement. (R&R at 43). Plaintiffs contend that Defendant \n“uniformly refuses to provide WAV service” in all Non-Access Regions. (Resp. at 20). Defendant \nargues that “the ADA does not require Lyft to provide WAV service.” (Obj. at 15). There is no \ndispute, however, that Defendant engages in the unitary course of conduct of refusing WAV \nservice in Non-Access Regions. (Resp. at 14, n.6; R&R at 41). Establishing the existence of such \na “unitary policy is sufficient for typicality.” Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., 331 F.R.D. at 294. \nThe question of whether Defendant’s categorical preclusion of WAV service in Non-Access \nRegions violated the ADA goes to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claim and is not relevant to the class \ncertification  determination  presently  before  the  Court.  Furthermore,  the  fact  that  Plaintiffs’ \nproposed modifications may impact class members differently, as Defendant suggests, has no \nbearing on the typicality determination. (Obj. at 15-16). Plaintiffs, rather, need only “establish a \ngeneral policy or course of conduct that was responsible for the barriers” faced by class members \nin order to establish typicality. Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., 331 F.R.D. at 294. That standard \nhas been amply satisfied here. \nAccordingly, the Court adopts Magistrate Judge Krause’s recommendation that Plaintiffs \nhave established typicality. \nD.  Adequacy \nDefendant objects to Magistrate Judge Krause’s determination that Lowell and WDOMI \nare adequate class representatives. The Report concluded they are adequate because they “have an \ninterest in vigorously pursuing the claims of the class; they seek the same relief as the class \nmembers they seek to represent; and they do not have interests that are antagonistic to the class \n20 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 21 of 25\nmembers.” (R&R at 44).10  The Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy requirement “serves to uncover conflicts \nof interest between named parties and the class[es] they seek to represent. A class representative \nmust be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class \nmembers.” Buffington v. Progressive Advanced Ins. Co., 342 F.R.D. 66, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2022) \n(internal quotation removed). \nDefendant argues that the named Plaintiffs have a “conflict” with putative class members \nin Non-Access Regions because they demand “equality” with Lyft’s “Standard Mode.” (Obj. at \n22). Defendant’s argument misconstrues Plaintiffs’ theory of the case to manufacture a conflict \nwhere none exists. This case is not about the app, it is about Defendant’s policies, practices, and \nprocedures concerning transportation services. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s policies with \nrespect to WAV services are discriminatory in all Non-Access Regions and, in all such regions, \nthe named Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes seek the same relief: “for Lyft to implement \nreasonable modifications that will rectify its discriminatory WAV policies.” (Resp. at 22). That \nthe availability of WAV rides—as well as non-WAV rides—may vary between different regions \nis irrelevant to adequacy. That issue, as Magistrate Krause noted, “speaks once again to the merits \nof the proposed modifications and whether they are reasonable.” (R&R at 43).  \nAccordingly, the Court adopts Magistrate Krause’s recommendation that Plaintiffs have \nestablished adequacy. \nE.  Ascertainability \nMagistrate Judge Krause correctly explained that, as a legal matter, “[b]oth the Second \nCircuit and numerous district courts in the circuit have approved of class definitions without \n \n10 Defendant does not challenge the recommendation to appoint Finkelstein, Blankinship, Frei-Pearson & \nGarber, LLP, Morgan & Morgan, P.C., and Michael Hellman of ADA compliance specialists as the class \ncounsel. The Court, accordingly, adopts that recommendation as well. \n21 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 22 of 25\nprecise ascertainability under Rule 23(b)(2) . . . [because] [i]t would be illogical to require precise \nascertainability in a suit that seeks no class damages.” (R&R at 45 (quoting Robinson v. N.Y.C. \nTransit Auth., No. 19-CV-01404, 2020 WL 5884055, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2020), adopted by \n2020 WL 5814189 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2020))).  Magistrate Judge Krause found that, in any event, \nPlaintiffs satisfied any implied ascertainability requirement because each of the proposed classes \nis  defined  using  objective  criteria.  Defendant  does  not  address  the  legal  issue  of  whether \nascertainability is required for a Rule 23(b)(2) class and only argues in passing that ascertainability \nis not met because defining a class by reference to “denial of equal access” to members is not an \nobjective criterion. \nDefendant relies entirely on the Indep. Living Res. Ctr. San Francisco case for its objection \nto ascertainability. 2020 WL 6802410 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2020). Ascertainability, however, was \nnot at issue in that case. See id. at *2 (noting that “[o]ur court of appeals has additionally held that \nthere is no explicit requirement in Rule 23 that a proposed class be ascertainable.” (citing True \nHealth Chiropractic, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 896 F.3d 923, 929 (9th Cir. 2018))). Rather, that \ndecision focused on the numerosity requirement, which the Court here has already determined has \nbeen met.  \nMoreover, decisions from this District have found criteria similar to the “denied equal \naccess” definition to be sufficiently objective for ascertainability purposes, especially in light of \nthe relaxed requirements for Rule 23(b)(2) classes. See, e.g. Westchester Indep. Living Ctr., 331 \nF.R.D. at 299 (“the class is defined using objective criteria – whether the person has a mobility \ndisability and whether the person has used or will use a pedestrian right-of-way on the campus – \nand thus the class is sufficiently ascertainable.”).  \n22 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 23 of 25\nAccordingly, the Court adopts Magistrate Krause’s recommendation that, to the extent \nrequired for a Rule 23(b)(2) class, Plaintiffs have established ascertainability. \nF.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nMagistrate Judge Krause concluded that Plaintiffs met the Rule 23(b)(2) standard because \n“Plaintiffs challenge uniform policies that Lyft follows in each of the difference regions covered \nby each of the proposed classes and seek the implementation of proposed reasonable modifications \ntailored to each of those uniform policies.” (R&R at 47). Defendant argues that Magistrate Judge \nKrause erred in reaching this conclusion because “Plaintiffs failed to prove the availability of a \nuniform remedy.” (Obj. at 7-8). Defendant further argues that Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden \nunder Rule 23(b)(2) because “there is no evidence based on which this Court could conclude that \nall putative class members would thereby benefit from an injunction ordering the redesign of \nLyft’s App.” (Id. at 11). \nRule 23(b)(2) “does not require that ‘the relief to each member of the class be identical, \nonly that it be beneficial.’” Barrows v. Becerra, 24 F.4th 116, 132 (2d Cir. 2022) (quoting Sykes \nv. Mel S. Harris & Assocs. LLC, 780 F.3d 70, 97 (2d Cir. 2015)). Plaintiffs propose “enjoining \nLyft from prohibiting WAV service in all Non-Access Regions.” (Resp. at 24). Such injunctive \nrelief would be beneficial to all class members as each would have the ability to hail a WAV using \nLyft. See Barrows, 24 F.4th at 132 (holding that Plaintiffs satisfied Rule 23(b)(2) where the \nproposed injunctive relief would provide class members with “the ability to appeal the denial of \nPart A coverage when they are reclassified from an inpatient to an outpatient receiving observation \ncare”). The injunctive relief requested here is sufficient for the purposes of Rule 23(b)(2). Id.  \nAccordingly, the Court adopts Magistrate Krause’s recommendation that Plaintiffs have \nsatisfied the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) with respect to each of their proposed classes.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 24 of 25\nCONCLUSION \nBased upon the foregoing, Defendant’s objections to the Report are overruled, and the \nCourt  adopts  the  Report  in  its  entirety,  except  with  the  modifications  noted  below  to  the \nrecommended class definitions.  \nThe Court certifies the following three classes: \no  All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft, aside from Lyft’s \nAccess Regions or NYC, who require WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who are denied \nequal access to Lyft’s transportation services (the Non-Access Region Class) (represented by \nLowell and WDOMI and asserting claims under the ADA) \no  All residents of or visitors to any and all regions serviced by Lyft in New York \nState aside from NYC who require WAVs for vehicular transportation, and who are denied equal \naccess to Lyft’s transportation services (the New York State Other Than NYC Class) (represented \nby Lowell asserting claims under the ADA and NYSHRL and WDOMI asserting claims under the \nADA); and \no  All residents of or visitors to Westchester County who require WAVs for vehicular \ntransportation, and who are denied equal access to Lyft’s transportation services (the Westchester \nClass) represented by Lowell asserting claims under the ADA and NYSHRL and WDOMI \nasserting claims under the ADA). \nExcluded from the classes are people who (1) have downloaded the Lyft app; (2) have \nbrought separate litigation against Lyft for its failure to serve people with disabilities; and/or (3) \nare residents of Ohio State University or the University of Texas at Austin who do not leave those \ncampuses. \n24 \n \n\nCase 7:17-cv-06251-PMH-AEK   Document 365   Filed 03/24/23   Page 25 of 25\nThe Court appoints Finkelstein, Blankinship, Frei-Pearson & Garber, LLP, Morgan & \nMorgan, P.C., and Michael Hellman of ADA compliance specialists as class counsel. \nA status conference has been scheduled for April 5, 2023 at 12:30 p.m. to be held by \ntelephone to discuss the filing of revised pretrial submissions.
