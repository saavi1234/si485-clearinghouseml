    "summary": "<p>This is a state court case challenging an abortion restriction in the state of Alaska. SB 24 (the \"Parental Consent Act\" or \"PCA\") enacted on May 2, 1997, prohibited any unemancipated or unmarried woman under 17 years of age from having an abortion unless she first obtained the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian or a court order authorizing the procedure. Anybody providing an abortion on a minor in non-compliance with this consent requirement would be subject to criminal and civil liability.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs&mdash;Planned Parenthood of Alaska and two obstetrician-gynecologists, on behalf of themselves and their patients, and ten anonymous pregnant minors who may seek future abortion services without complying with the law&mdash;filed suit in the Superior Court of Alaska, Third Judicial District at Anchorage on July 25, 1997. Represented by attorneys from the Alaska Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the predecessor to the Center for Reproductive Rights, plaintiffs filed suit against the State of Alaska, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs brought three counts of relief under the Alaska Constitution. Count I alleged that the PCA unlawfully infringed upon a minor&rsquo;s right to reproductive choice under the state Constitution&rsquo;s right to privacy, which Alaska Courts had interpreted as conferring broader privacy protection than afforded under the U.S. Constitution. Count II alleged that the PCA violated the equal protection and inherent rights clauses of the state Constitution by unjustly discriminating among &nbsp;&ldquo;suspect and arbitrary classifications,&rdquo; including but not limited to, between minors in urban and rural areas, between minors who seek abortion services and other services, and between people who are married and emancipated and who are not. Count III alleged violations of the due process clause of the state Constitution because the PCA is not substantially related to any lawful, valid purpose, and Count IV alleged violations of plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional civil rights because the law imposed substantial restrictions on the constitutional rights of young women despite the constitutional provision that &ldquo;[n]o person is to be denied the enjoyment of any civil or political right because of sex&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Later, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. On February 25, 1998, the superior court granted that motion on equal protection grounds because the PCA required consent or judicial authorization for pregnant minors who chose abortion, but not for those who chose to continue their pregnancy. Addressing the issue about minor&rsquo;s right to privacy, Superior Court Judge Sen K. Tan relied on the Alaska Constitution&rsquo;s guarantee of privacy, the Alaska Supreme Court&rsquo;s case law interpreting that right, and relevant cases from other states to determine that privacy is a fundamental individual right encompassing a pregnant woman&rsquo;s reproductive choices that coextensively applies to minors and adults. Judge Tan acknowledged differences may exist between a minor&rsquo;s and adult&rsquo;s capacity to make mature reproductive choices. However, he reasoned that those differences did not dilute the fundamental quality of a minor&rsquo;s constitutional right but instead may vindicate the state&rsquo;s interest in controlling the circumstances under which minors can exercise their privacy right without supervision. Because the PCA&rsquo;s stated purposes and supporting findings did not establish a compelling state interest, the trial court found no need to resolve open issues in requiring consent and granted summary judgment to plaintiffs. On October 5, 1998, the superior court granted final judgment, consistent with its summary judgment opinion, and awarded attorney's fees.</p>\r\n<p>The defendant&nbsp;appealed the case to the Alaska Supreme Court. It rendered an opinion on November 16, 2001 that affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the district court. Writing for the majority, Justice Alexander O. Bryner concluded that the superior court erred in declining to hear evidence on the state&rsquo;s compelling interests in enforcing its parental consent statute and on whether the statute was narrowly tailored to promote such interests. The Alaska Supreme Court adopted the superior court&rsquo;s approach positing a constitutional right of privacy that extends fully to all Alaskans but may be limited for compelling reasons, rather than the state&rsquo;s approach positing a privacy right limited to adults only, therefore requiring no demonstrated compelling reasons to restrict the privacy rights of minors. 35 P.3d 30.</p>\r\n<p>In the same opinion, Justice Bryner also addressed whether equal protection bars the state from enforcing parental consent or judicial authorization requirements because of impermissible discrimination among different classes of similarly situated minors, those who elect to have abortions and those who elect to carry to term. He first laid out Alaska&rsquo;s equal protection standard, a flexible, &ldquo;three-step sliding-scale test.&rdquo; First, the nature of the right must be established. Second, the court examines the importance of the state purpose served. Finally, the court considers whether the particular means the state selects to further its purpose. For a more fundamental right, the state must prove a compelling interest under the second step and demonstrate that no less restrictive alternative measures exist to accomplish its purpose under the third step. Justice Bryner noted that the trial court failed to probe the second step&mdash;whether the state had shown a compelling interest&mdash;and therefore also failed to analyze thoroughly under the third step whether the parental consent and judicial authorization requirements achieved the state&rsquo;s interests by the least restrictive means. The case was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. 35 P.3d 30.</p>\r\n<p>Upon remand, Judge Tan held a bench trial from January 6 to January 24, 2003. His October 13, 2003 opinion answered a narrow question: whether the PCA could selectively burden the exercise of the privacy right by requiring pregnant minors under age 17 to obtain parental or judicial consent before getting an abortion. The State asserted interests in &ldquo;protecting minors from their own immaturity; protecting the health of minors; preserving the integrity of the family, including protecting the rights of parents; preserving the rights to a civil action; and, promoting the social benefits of reducing teenage high risk sexual activity.&rdquo; Judge Tan analyzed whether the PCA was narrowly tailored to serve each interest. First, he concluded the PCA was not the least restrictive means to protect minors from their own immaturity because it arbitrarily treated the decision to terminate a pregnancy differently from the decision to carry to term, though both decisions required the same level of maturity. Second, the PCA also did not further the state interest of protecting the health of minors because the act only burdened one set of medical risks&mdash;those associated with abortions&mdash;and not the generally higher risks associated with pregnancy or childbirth. Third, Judge Tan identified that the State could not have a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of the family, including protecting the rights of parents to raise their children, that would justify intrusion into every family and the pregnancy choice of every minor woman, because that in &ldquo;highly functional&rdquo; families, the PCA would be &ldquo;irrelevant and redundant&rdquo; but in &ldquo;highly dysfunctional&rdquo; families, such as in circumstances involving parental abuse, the PCA could be detrimental to to the minor. Fourth, Judge Tan found the PCA did not further rights to a civil action because the State failed to show that people experienced difficulties suing doctors for malpractice for abortions, and noted that the legislature could create new causes of actions or extend statutes of limitation instead. Finally, Judge Tan addressed the final interest in promoting the social benefits of reducing teenage high-risk sexual activity. He found that while the State had a compelling interest in protecting the health and safety of minors, it only had an &ldquo;important&rdquo; interest in reducing their sexual activities. Judge Tan concluded the PCA was not an appropriately tailored means, because (1) evidence in other states with parental involvement laws showed teenagers did not learn about the law until after they became pregnant, (2) other directly tailored means could achieve the same goals, and (3) the number of abortions dropped in states with similar laws but could have been influenced by other factors such as traveling out-of-state for abortions or the general national reduction in teen pregnancy rates. Finally, the judicial authorization requirement infringed on a minor&rsquo;s right to privacy and treated pregnant minors within Alaska differently depending on many variables, such as where they lived. Travel could be detrimental to the minor both socially (missing school) and physically (delaying the abortion). Ultimately, Judge Tan concluded the PCA failed to further compelling state interests using the least restrictive means. 2003 WL 25446126.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Tan entered judgment on January 7, 2004 declaring the PCA unconstitutional under Alaska Constitution Article I, sections 1 and 22, and permanently enjoining the State of Alaska, its officers, agents, servants, and employees from implementing or enforcing the act.</p>\r\n<p>Defendant appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court again. On November 2, 2007, writing for the majority, Justice Dana A. Fabe held that the State failed to establish that parental consent was necessary to achieve its compelling interests. Though she agreed that the State had legitimate interests in &ldquo;protecting minors from their own immaturity&rdquo; and &ldquo;aiding parents in fulfilling their parental responsibilities,&rdquo; she found the PCA did not advance those interests using the least restrictive means because parental notification, rather than parental consent, could successfully avoid the constitutionally suspect &ldquo;veto power&rdquo; that a parent could exercise over their minor child&rsquo;s right to choose. The judicial authorization alternative also failed to lessen the restrictiveness or intrusiveness of the parental consent requirement, compared to the alternative of parental notification. The Court affirmed the Superior Court&rsquo;s decision striking down the PCA. 171 P.3d 577.</p>\r\n<p>The defendant's&nbsp;motion for rehearing was denied on December 14, 2007. This case is now closed.</p>",

Planned Parenthood of Alaska, 35 P.3d 30 (2001)   \n \n \nIn 1997 the Alaska Legislature passed S.B. 24, an act that  Having determined that the Alaska Constitution’s privacy \nprohibits  doctors  from  performing  abortions  on  clause protects minors and adults alike, the superior court \nunemancipated  women  under  seventeen  years  of  age  decided that the act requiring parental consent or judicial \nwithout parental consent or judicial authorization1 and that  authorization could withstand constitutional scrutiny on \nsubjects  doctors  to  criminal  penalties  for  knowingly  privacy grounds only if the state established that it had a \nperforming  abortions  on  minors  without  the  required  compelling interest in requiring consent and that no less \nconsent or authorization.2 The act’s consent requirement  restrictive means of achieving that interest existed.

DISCUSSION \n    \nBefore reaching the equal protection issue, however, the \ncourt addressed the issue of a minor’s right to privacy. \nA. Standard of Review \nRelying on the Alaska Constitution’s express guarantee of \n We will affirm a grant of summary judgment only when, \nprivacy,8 this court’s case law interpreting that right, and \nconstruing all disputed inferences of fact in favor of the \nrelevant  cases  from  states  interpreting  similar \nnon-moving  party,  we  find  that  there  are  no  genuine \nconstitutional provisions, the superior court determined \nissues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to \nthat privacy is a fundamental individual right, that this \njudgment as a matter of law.9 In deciding questions of \nright  encompasses  a  pregnant  woman’s  reproductive \nlaw, “[o]ur duty is to adopt the rule of law that is most \nchoices,  and  that  it  applies  to  minors  and  adults \npersuasive in light of precedent, reason, and policy.”10 \nco-extensively,  regardless  of  age.  While  recognizing \n  \nobvious distinctions between a minor’s and an adult’s \n \ncapacity to make mature reproductive choices, the court \n \nreasoned  that  such  differences  do  not  dilute  the \nfundamental quality of a minor’s constitutional right to \nprivacy, but relate instead to the state’s countervailing  B.

In contrast, Justice Souter, separately \nconcurring, accepted without question “the power of a State’s highest court to construe its domestic statute and to \napply a demanding standard when ruling on its facial constitutionality.” 530 U.S. at 79, 120 S.Ct. 2054. \n \n22  505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). \n \n \n23  See id. at 894, 898, 112 S.Ct. 2791. \n \n \n24  Id. at 894, 112 S.Ct. 2791. \n \n \n25  948 P.2d 963 (Alaska 1997). \n \n \n26  Ravin v.

Alaska State–Operated School System, \n  536 P.2d 793 (Alaska 1975). The constitutional clause at issue there was article VII, section 1, which requires the \nlegislature to “establish and maintain a system of local public schools open to all children of the State.” Because this \nprovision explicitly assigns the legislature specific, ongoing duties that are legislative in nature—establishing and \nmaintaining a system of local schools—we declined to construe the word “open” as requiring a specific legislative \ncourse of action-the building of schools in all Alaska villages. Hootch, 536 P.2d at 804. Here, by contrast, the \nlegislative implementation language of article I, section 22, is far less specific; the provision’s substantive language \ndirectly grants to Alaska citizens, not to the legislature, a personal, broad-based right against governmental \nintrusion; and the role of interpreting this kind of constitutional grant is quintessentially judicial in nature. \n \n56  See, e.g., Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979). In Bellotti, the Court identified three \n  reasons supporting the conclusion that the constitutional rights of children in the abortion context cannot be \nequated with those of adults: “the peculiar vulnerability of children; their inability to make critical decisions in an \ninformed, mature manner; and the importance of the parental role in child rearing.” Id. at 634, 99 S.Ct. 3035 \n(plurality opinion). \n \n57  See, e.g., In re D.D.S., 869 P.2d 160, 163 (Alaska 1994) (determining that an evidentiary privilege protecting alcohol \n  treatment records does not apply in CINA proceedings); M.O.W. v.

PURPOSE; FINDINGS. (a) It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this Act to further the important \nand compelling state interests of \n(1) protecting minors against their own immaturity; \n(2) fostering the family structure and preserving it as a viable social unit; \n(3) protecting the rights of parents to rear children who are members of their household; and \n21 \n \n\nState v. Planned Parenthood of Alaska, 35 P.3d 30 (2001)   \n \n \n(4) protecting the health of minor women. \n(b) The legislature finds that \n(1) immature minors often lack the ability to make fully informed choices that take account of both \nimmediate and long-range consequences; \n(2) the physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of abortion are serious and can be lasting \nparticularly when the patient is immature; \n(3) the capacity to become pregnant and the capacity for mature judgment concerning the wisdom of an \nabortion are not necessarily related; \n(4) parents ordinarily possess information essential to a physician’s or surgeon’s best medical judgment \nconcerning the child; \n(5) parents who are aware that their minor daughter has had an abortion may better ensure that the \ndaughter receives adequate medical attention after the abortion; \n(6) parental consultation is usually desirable and in the best interest of the minor; and \n(7) parental involvement legislation enacted in other states has shown to have a significant effect in reducing \nabortion, birth, and pregnancy rates among minors. \nCh. 14, § 1, SLA 1997. \n \n84  See American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren, 16 Cal.4th 307, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d 797 (1997); In re T.W., \n  551 So.2d 1186 (Fla.1989). \n \n85  AS 25.20.025(a) provides: \n \n(a) Except as prohibited under AS 18.16.010(a)(3), \n(1) a minor who is living apart from the minor’s parents or legal guardian and who is managing the minor’s own \nfinancial affairs, regardless of the source or extent of income, may give consent for medical and dental services for \nthe minor; \n(2) a minor may give consent for medical and dental services if the parent or legal guardian of the minor cannot be \ncontacted or, if contacted, is unwilling either to grant or withhold consent; however, where the parent or legal \nguardian cannot be contacted or, if contacted, is unwilling either to grant or to withhold consent, the provider of \nmedical or dental services shall counsel the minor keeping in mind not only the valid interests of the minor but also \nthe valid interests of the parent or guardian and the family unit as best the provider presumes them; \n(3) a minor who is the parent of a child may give consent to medical and dental services for the minor or the child; \n(4) a minor may give consent for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of pregnancy, and for diagnosis and treatment \nof venereal disease; \n(5) the parent or guardian of the minor is relieved of all financial obligation to the provider of the service under this \nsection. \n22 \n \n\nState v. Planned Parenthood of Alaska, 35 P.3d 30 (2001)   \n \n \n \n86  For example, Planned Parenthood contends that the act’s judicial authorization requirement would functionally \n  create geographical classifications by imposing insurmountable burdens on pregnant minors who live in remote \nareas of the state that lack readily accessible judicial and legal services. It also contends that the act impermissibly \ndistinguishes between minors who are seventeen years of age and those who are younger and between minors who \nare married or emancipated and those who are not. \n \n87  See, e.g., Newton v. Magill, 872 P.2d 1213, 1215 (Alaska 1994). \n \n \n88  The state alternatively argues that pregnant minors who choose abortion and those who choose to give birth are \n  not similarly situated. Since we conclude that a remand is necessary on the issues of compelling state interest and \nleast restrictive alternative, we need not address this argument here. We note, however, that the question whether \nthese two subsets of pregnant minors are similarly situated may not readily lend itself to disposition as a matter of \nlaw. In our view, the question may require the resolution of disputed issues of fact. Accordingly, the parties should \nbe allowed to address this issue at the evidentiary hearing on remand. \n \n89  667 P.2d 1184 (Alaska 1983). \n \n \n90  Id. at 1193 (quoting Isakson v. Rickey, 550 P.2d 359, 362 (Alaska 1976) (other citations omitted)). \n \n \n91  Id. (emphasis added). \n \n \n92  See, e.g., Gilbert v. State, 526 P.2d 1131, 1134–36 (Alaska 1974). If the court’s inquiry had revealed no compelling \n  governmental interests, of course, then the court would have needed to go no further: the lack of a compelling state \ninterest would have doomed the act under either the privacy or equal protection analyses. \n \n93  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v. Attorney General, 424 Mass. 586, 677 N.E.2d 101, 106 n. 10 \n  (1997) (“The differences between an adult and a minor; between married, widowed, or divorced pregnant minors \nand an unmarried pregnant minor; and between the special considerations applicable to an abortion as opposed to \nsome other intrusive medical procedure justify the special treatment that [the statute] accords to an unmarried \npregnant minor who seeks to terminate her pregnancy.”); see also, e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren, \n16 Cal.4th 307, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d 797, 865 (Mosk, J., dissenting) (“[The legislature] could reasonably, and \nneutrally, determine, as a matter of policy, that in the case of an unemancipated minor who is pregnant and intends \nto bear a child the public health interest in allowing her to obtain medical care for herself and her fetus is overriding, \nregardless of parental approval and whether or not the unemancipated minor is mature.”). \n \n94  See, e.g., Ch. 14 § 1(b)(2), (7), SLA 1997. \n23 \n \n\nState v.

American Academy of Pediatrics, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d at 827 (existence of numerous statutes allowing \n  minors to obtain medical care without parental consent is “fundamentally inconsistent” with contention that statute \nrequiring a minor’s parental consent to abortion “is necessary to protect the health of such minor or to support the \nparent-child relationship”); see also AS 25.20.025(a)(4) (except as access to abortion is limited by the parental \nconsent  or  judicial  authorization  act,  a  “minor  may  give  consent  for  diagnosis,  prevention  or treatment  of \npregnancy, and for diagnosis and treatment of venereal disease”); AS 25.20.025(a)(1) (allowing independent minors \nto give consent for all medical services except abortion). \n \n97  Cf.

Magill, 872 P.2d 1213, 1215 (Alaska 1994). \n \n \n100  Notably, none of the three state supreme court cases that have invalidated provisions similar to Alaska’s has \n  declined to decide whether the state had a compelling interest that justified burdening the privacy rights of a minor. \nIn American Academy of Pediatrics, the Supreme Court of California struck down a similar provision without squarely \ndeciding the equal protection issue, relying solely on privacy grounds to conclude that the state had failed to provide \n“adequate justification for the statute’s intrusion on a pregnant minor’s right to privacy under the California \nConstitution.” 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d at 831. In Planned Parenthood of Central N.J., 762 A.2d at 631–39, and In \nre T.W., 551 So.2d 1186, 1192–93 (Fla.1989), the Supreme Court of New Jersey and Supreme Court of Florida struck \nsimilar statutes on grounds of equal protection, but only after each court initially determined that the statutes \nviolated the privacy rights of pregnant minors, because the states lacked a compelling interest to require parental \nconsent. \n \n101  Valley Hosp. Ass’n v. Mat–Su Coalition for Choice, 948 P.2d 963, 972 (Alaska 1997). \n \n \n102  In Breese v. Smith, 501 P.2d 159 (Alaska 1972), we noted a trend in cases involving conflicts between school \n  appearance codes and the personal rights of students of rejecting mere conjectural justifications for the codes and \nrequiring instead empirical studies or other forms of “ ‘hard facts.’ ” Id. at 172 & n. 57. We also note that the \nSupreme Court of California in American Academy of Pediatrics based its ruling that a parental consent statute \nviolated a minor’s state constitutional right to privacy on “overwhelming evidence” introduced at trial, including the \ntestimony of expert witnesses “with training and experience in the fields of health care, adolescent development, \n24 \n \n\nState v. Planned Parenthood of Alaska, 35 P.3d 30 (2001)   \n \n \nand the application of judicial bypass procedures in other states.” 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d at 806, 828. The \ntestimony-unavailable here-covered a wide range of subjects, “including the relative medical and psychological risks \nposed to pregnant minors by abortion and childbirth, the general maturity of minors seeking abortion, the existing \nguidelines and practices with regard to the counseling provided to minors seeking abortion, and the general efficacy \n(or lack thereof) of the judicial bypass process in other jurisdictions.” Id. at 806. In Planned Parenthood of Central \nN.J., no trial or evidentiary hearing was held because “the parties agreed that the matter should be heard ‘solely on \nbriefs and certifications.’ ” 762 A.2d at 625. The court relied heavily on the evidence submitted by certification. See \nid. at 632–38. Here, by contrast, the parties did not stipulate to a body of evidence for the court to consider in \ndeciding the issues presented.

INTRODUCTION \nThe plaintiffs Planned Parenthood of Alaska, et al. filed this \nlawsuit  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  the  Alaska  Parental \nConsent  Act,  Alaska  Statute  18.16.010  et  seq.   This  court  granted \nsummary  judgment,  ruling  that  the  act  was  unconstitutional.   The \nState appealed and the Supreme Court remanded the case to this court \nfor an evidentiary hearing.  State v. Planned Parenthood of Alaska, \n35 P.3d 30, 46 (Alaska 2001). \nIt is important to understand the issue presented on remand by \nthe Alaska Supreme Court.  The issue is not whether it is beneficial \nfor loving and caring parents to assist and counsel their children \nthrough difficult situations.  The answer to this question is always, \n“Yes.”  Further,  the  Act  does  not  prohibit  parents  from  fulfilling \ntheir parental responsibilities.  Rather, the narrow question in view \nof  the  Supreme  Court’s  determination  that  privacy  is  a  fundamental \nconstitutional  right,  is  whether  it  is  permissible  to  selectively \nburden the exercise of the privacy right by requiring women under age \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 2 of 29\n17  to  seek  parental  or  judicial  consent  before  obtaining  an \nabortion.   \nUnder the Alaska Constitution, minors have the same fundamental \nright to privacy over their reproductive choice as adult women. Id.\nat 40.  Therefore, this court must evaluate whether the State has a \ncompelling  interest  in  enforcing  the  parental  consent  statute  and \nwhether  the  statute  is  properly  tailored  to  promote  the  State's \ninterest by the least restrictive means possible. Id. at 32.  \nIn accordance with the Supreme Court’s instruction to conduct an \nevidentiary  hearing,  this  court  has  accumulated  and  considered  a \nsubstantial  body  of  evidence,  and  applied  the  well-defined  equal \nprotection standard articulated by the Supreme Court to the facts.  \nHaving  evaluated  the  evidence,  these  are  the  court’s  “Findings  of \nFact and Conclusions of Law.”  \n  \n   \nII.     FINDINGS OF FACT \nA.     Introduction \nThe State asserts several state interests.  Those identified in \nthe  Statement  of  Legislative  Purpose  are:   (1)  protecting  minors \nagainst their own immaturity; (2) fostering the family structure and \npreserving it as a viable social unit; (3) protecting the rights of \nparents to rear children who are members of their household; and (4) \nprotecting the health of minor women.  Ch. 14, §1, SLA 1997.   \nIn  addition  to  the  stated  legislative  purposes,  the  State \ncontends that the legislation will:  (1) protect the health of minor \nwomen  by  protecting  them  from  their  immature  decision  making;  (2) \nprotect  the  health  of  minors  by  ensuring  minors  make  informed  and \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 3 of 29\nintelligent choices about their abortion providers; (3) protect \nthe  health  of  minors  by  ensuring  minors  give  informed  consent  to \nabortions; (4) protect the health of minors by ensuring minors give \ncomplete  and  accurate  medical  histories;  (5)  protect  the  health  of \nminors by ensuring minors receive adequate post-abortion support and \nobservation;  (6)  protect  the  health  of  minors  by  protecting  minor \nfemales  from  physical  and  sexual  assault;  (7)  protect  the \nconstitutional rights of parents; (8) preserve the integrity of the \nfamily  as  a  viable  social  unit;  (9)  preserve  the  rights  of  minors \nand/or parents to pursue a civil action; and, (10) promote the social \nbenefits of reducing teenage high risk sexual activity. \nMany  of  the  interests  that  the  State  asserted  at  trial  are \ninterrelated, as they combine a means to achieving an interest with \nthe interest itself.  For instance, the State argues that there is an \ninterest  in  obtaining  accurate  and  complete  medical  histories,  but \nalso argues that complete and accurate medical histories are a means \nto  achieving  the  end  of  protecting  the  physical,  emotional  and \npsychological  health  of  minors.   To  the  extent  that  some  interests \nare  related  and  dependent,  they  have  been  combined  into  a  single \ncategory where appropriate.  \nAccordingly,  this  court  will  discuss  the  following  State’s \ninterests:  protecting  minors  from  their  own  immaturity;  protecting \nthe  health  of  minors;  preserving  the  integrity  of  the  family, \nincluding protecting the rights of parents; preserving the rights to \na  civil  action;  and,  promoting  the  social  benefits  of  reducing \nteenage high risk sexual activity. Lastly, the court will address the \nburdens imposed by the judicial bypass procedure.  \nWithin each category of claimed state interest, this court has \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 4 of 29\nmade  findings  and  conclusions  relating  to:  (i)  the  nature  and \nimportance  of  the  interest;  and  (ii)  whether  the  Act  appropriately \nfurthers the interest.   \nB.     Protecting minors from their own immaturity \ni. The Nature and Importance of the Interest \n  \nThis  court  finds  that  the  State  has  a  compelling  interest  in \nprotecting minors from their own immaturity in making some decisions, \nbased on the following findings: \n1.     In general, minors are less mature than adults and less \nlikely to make decisions that take into account both short-term and \nlong-term consequences. \n2.      Adolescence  is  a  period  when  a  person’s  emotional  and \nintellectual abilities fluctuate.  Minors tend to be more impulsive, \nmore  accepting  of  risk,  and  more  self-centered.  Brain  mapping \ntechnology  shows  that  the  brains  of  adolescents  are  undergoing \nchanges.  \n3. The capacity to become pregnant and the capacity to make \n              \nmature decisions are not necessarily related. \n4. Placing a minor in a position to make adult decisions puts \n              \nthem under stress.  In general, the younger the minor, the greater \nthe stress.  \n5.     Although a rare occurrence, minors as young as 10 can get \npregnant.   An  unplanned  pregnancy  is  a  stressful  event  for  women.  \nDecisions relating to an unplanned pregnancy will require the minor \nto make decisions that will have long-term consequences.  \n6.      A  minor  is  less  able  to  evaluate  the  emotional, \nfinancial,  and  educational  or  vocational  impacts  associated  with \npregnancy  or  abortion,  as  well  as  the  impacts  on  her  relationship \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 5 of 29\nwith her family and the impregnating male.  \n7.     The immaturity of minors is a cause of unplanned teenage \npregnancy.   Teenage  pregnancy  and  teenage  parents  contribute  to \nseveral social problems.   \n8.     The maturity of a person is individualized, but generally \nthe  younger  the  minor,  the  less  equipped  the  minor  is  to  make \nimportant decisions. \n9.     Minors under age 17 are not equally mature or immature.  \nFor  minors  age  10  or  11,  protecting  the  child  from  their  own \nimmaturity  can  be  a  compelling  state  interest.   As  the  minor \napproaches the age of majority, the State interest is no longer as \ncompelling but is still an important state interest.   \nii. Does the Act Appropriately Further the Compelling \nState Interest?  \n  \nHaving found that protecting children from their immaturity is a \ncompelling state interest, this court must next address whether the \nParental  Consent  Act  serves  the  State  interest  and  is  the  least \nrestrictive alternative to meet that end. \n     10.      The  Act  applies  to  all  unmarried,  unemancipated  minor \nwomen  under  the  age  of  17.  It  does  not  apply  to  emancipated  or \nmarried women under age 17.  \n    11.     No persuasive evidence was presented to suggest that a \nmaterial distinction exists between the maturity of 15, 16, 17, or \n18-year olds.  Furthermore, it is difficult to generalize about 11, \n12, and 13-year olds because there is very little conclusive evidence \nin the lower age ranges addressing the pregnancy/abortion question or \nother  medical  decisions.  Younger  minors  are  less  likely  to  get \npregnant.   Younger  minors  are  more  likely  to  voluntarily  involve  a \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 6 of 29\nparent.    \n     12.      Generalizations  about  how  an  age  group  makes  decisions \nare  not  necessarily  an  accurate  predictor  about  how  individuals \nwithin that age group will make a specific decision. Decision-making \ncapability is domain specific.  The pregnancy decision-making process \nis unique.  The generalizations that minors are more impulsive, less \nfuture  oriented,  and  more  emotional  in  their  decision-making  are \nbased  on  research  and  common  experience  not  specifically  targeted \ntoward the pregnancy/abortion decision.   \n     13.      All  pregnant  minors  make  a  decision  as  to  their \npregnancy.   Some  minors  make  affirmative  decisions:  to  carry  the \npregnancy to term; to seek prenatal care; to involve their families \nor friends; or, to have an abortion.  Other minors passively address \nthe issues that surround pregnancy: not evaluating the options; not \nseeking prenatal care; and not involving parents and friends. \n    14.     A minor’s pregnancy will reach a stage where it becomes \nimpossible for her to hide the fact that she is pregnant; although, \nin very rare instances, a woman may be able to hide signs of being \npregnant until delivery, or until it is either medically unsafe or \ntoo late to get a legal abortion.   \n    15.     There is no qualitative difference between the maturity \nnecessary  to  decide  to  carry  a  pregnancy  to  term  and  the  maturity \nnecessary  to  decide  to  have  an  abortion.   The  evidence  does  not \nsupport any difference between the maturity levels necessary to make \neither decision.  Some support exists for the proposition that minors \nwho  act  passively  regarding  their  pregnancy  are  less  mature  than \nthose who respond affirmatively.   \n16.  The development of brain mapping technology is in its early \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 7 of 29\nstages  and  no  evidence  exists  that  this  technology  has  been \napplied to the pregnancy decision.  The scientific community has not \ndrawn any definite conclusions about how the still-developing brain \nof a minor affects the pregnancy/abortion decision.  \n17.      The  assistance  of  a  conscientious  and  caring  parent \nwould be an asset to a minor making a pregnancy decision.  A minor \nwith a healthy parent-child relationship will more likely involve the \nparent in important decisions.  Younger minors are also more likely \nto voluntarily involve parents in a pregnancy decision.  \n18.      Not  all  parents  are  conscientious  and  caring  or  even \nable  to  help  a  child  in  making  important  decisions.   Dysfunctional \nfamilies exist in our society, including parents who are addicted to \ndrugs and alcohol and minors who are the victims of physical, sexual, \nand emotional abuse. \n19.     Minors who do not voluntarily involve their parents in \ntheir decision to get an abortion tend to demonstrate traits such as \nbeing  future-oriented,  having  greater  sense  of  self,  having  some \ndegree  of  financial  independence,  and  being  able  to  navigate  the \nhealth care system and a judicial bypass system.  These traits may be \nconsidered to be evidence of maturity. \n20.     The decision to carry the pregnancy to term has as much, \nif  not  more,  long-term  effects  on  the  life  of  the  minor  than  the \ndecision  to  have  an  abortion.   To  the  extent  that  minors  are  less \nmature  than  adults,  they  are  less  able  to  consider  the  long-term \neffects and demands of motherhood.     \n21.      The  Act  treats  the  decision  to  have  an  abortion \ndifferently than the decision to carry the pregnancy to term because \nit only requires parental consent to have an abortion. \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 8 of 29\niii. Conclusion \nBased  on  the  preceding  findings  of  fact,  this  court  concludes \nthat  the  Alaska  Parental  Consent  Act  is  not  the  least  restrictive \nalternative  to  further  the  compelling  state  interest  of  protecting \nminors from their own immaturity.   \nPassing  the  parental  consent  law  to  protect  minors  from  their \nown  immaturity  arbitrarily  treats  the  decision  to  terminate  a \npregnancy  differently  than  the  decision  to  carry  to  term.   The \nmaturity level necessary to make either decision is the same, and the \nParental Consent Act is under-inclusive.  If a minor is too immature \nto  evaluate  her  pregnancy  choices,  then  she  is  too  immature \nregardless of what decision she makes.   \nFurthermore, the Act is over-inclusive in making a distinction \nbetween the maturity level of 15 and 16-year olds, and the maturity \nlevel  of  17-year  olds.   As  evidenced  by  the  judicial  bypass \nprovision,  the  legislature  acknowledges  that  some  minors  may  be \nmature enough to make a pregnancy decision.  In states with judicial \nbypass procedures, judges approve nearly all of the petitions because \n[1]  \nthe minors are mature enough to make their own decision.   \nAlthough this court finds that protecting minors from their own \nimmaturity  in  making  important  decisions  is  a  compelling  state \ninterest,  the  Parental  Consent  Act  is  not  narrowly  tailored  to \nachieve that interest.    \nC. Protecting the health of minors \n  \ni. The Nature and Importance of the Interest  \n      \na. The  Physical,  Emotional  and  Psychological \n              \nHealth of Minors \n  \nThis  court  finds  that  the  State  has  a  compelling  interest  in \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 9 of 29\nprotecting the physical, emotional, and psychological health of \nminors, based on the following findings:  \n22.  Physical  risks  associated  with  abortions  are  numerous. \nPreexisting maternal health conditions can complicate the procedure.  \nShort-term physical risks associated with abortion include: bleeding, \ninfections,  damage  to  internal  organs,  retained  products  of \nconception, anesthesia related complications, and death.    \n23.      Long-term  physical  risks  associated  with  abortion \ninclude risks in subsequent pregnancies of pre-term babies, low birth \nweight  babies,  placenta  previa,  sterility  or  loss  of  fertility.  \nOther associated risks include an increased risk of breast cancer, an \nincreased risk of death by homicide, and an increased risk of death \nby  accident.   It  is  difficult  to  generalize  the  long-term  risks \n[2]  \nassociated with abortion because of intervening factors.   \n     24.      Similarly,  it  is  difficult  to  generalize  the  emotional \nand  psychological  risks  of  abortions.  Physiological  and  emotional \nrisks  of  abortion  include:  depression,  post-traumatic  stress, \nsuicidal ideation, increased risk of suicide, psychiatric admissions, \nand substance abuse.   \n    25.     Physical risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth \nare  numerous.   Preexisting  maternal  health  conditions  such  as \ndiabetes, seizure disorders, bleeding disorders, hypertension, heart \ndisease,  and  asthma,  can  complicate  pregnancy.   Also, complications \ncan  arise  during  pregnancy  including:  gestational  diabetes, \npregnancy-induced  hypertension,  over-distension  of  the  uterus, \npostpartum hemorrhage, and respiratory conditions.  It  is difficult \nto generalize the physical risks of pregnancy and childbirth because \nthe risks are numerous and are influenced by preexisting and post-\nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 10 of 29\npregnancy health conditions. \n    26.     For the same reason, it is difficult to generalize the \nemotional  and  psychological  risks  associated  with  pregnancy  and \nchildbirth.   Women  who  carry  a  pregnancy  to  term  are  at  risk  of \npsychiatric  illness  such  as  postpartum  depression.  A  full-term \npregnancy  is  also  associated  with  depression.   The  emotional  and \npsychological risks from an unwanted pregnancy are higher than for a \ndesired pregnancy.  Forcing a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to \nterm may have negative emotional and psychological consequences. The \nchildren of unwanted pregnancies are at high risk for abuse, neglect, \nmental illness, and deprivation of the quality of life  \n     27.      Having  parental  involvement  may  or  may  not  be \nbeneficial.  Many minors tend to inaccurately predict their parents’\nreaction to stressful news.  Many parents are supportive, loving, and \nhelpful  to  minor  children  in  stressful  situations.   On  the  other \nhand, there are parents who are not supportive and who are abusive, \nand a minor’s fear of telling her parents about a pregnancy is often \nlegitimate.   \n28.  Forcing  a  minor  to  consult  someone  who  is  abusive  or  not \nsupportive may have negative consequences.  Forcing a minor to carry \na  pregnancy  to  term  against  her  wishes  may  have  negative \nconsequences.   Forcing  a  minor  to  go  through  the  judicial  bypass \nsystem may have negative emotional consequences because it may cause \nher to feel as though she does not have control over the decision, \ncompromise her privacy, and/or stigmatize her decision.  \n29.      The  need  for  post-abortion  or  post-operative  care  is \ndirectly related to the State’s interest of caring for the physical \nhealth of the minors.  It is important that patients follow abortion \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 11 of 29\npost-procedure  instructions  and  monitor  themselves  for \ncomplications.  This applies both to abortion and for other invasive \nmedical procedures.   \n30.      When  patients  delay  seeking  care  for  complications \nfollowing  an  invasive  medical  procedure,  it  could  result  in \nhospitalization  and/or  could  be  life-threatening.   This \ngeneralization applies to abortion.   \n31.     Minors who do not tell their parents about the abortion \nand then experience complications may delay seeking medical care and \nmay try to hide complications from the abortion.  Delays in seeking \ntreatment  may  increase  the  severity  of  the  complications, \nparticularly  in  the  case  of  infection  and  bleeding.   These \ncomplications  can  have  serious  long-term  consequences  including \nsterilization and possibly death.      \n32.      The  risk  of  post-abortion  complications  is  relatively \nsmall.   Of  the  minors  who  will  choose  to  have  an  abortion  without \nvoluntarily  informing  their  parents,  very  few  will  suffer  post-\nabortion  complications.   Of  those,  even  fewer  will  neglect  to  seek \nprompt medical treatment for the complications.     \n                    b.     Informed Consent \n This  court  finds  that  the  State  has  a  compelling  interest  in \nensuring  that  doctors  obtain  informed  consent  from  their  minor \npatients  contemplating  pregnancy-related  decisions,  based  on  the \nfollowing findings: \n33.     The parties presented extensive evidence on the topic of \ninformed consent.   Regarding  informed  consent,  all  invasive  medical \nprocedures,  including  abortion,  carry  some  level  of  risk.   Doctors \nexplain the risks of procedures during the informed consent process. \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 12 of 29\nThe  patient  needs  to  understand  these  risks  in  order  to  give \ninformed consent to the procedure.   \n34.      The  medical  community  generally  regards  abortion  as  a \nvery  safe  procedure.   The  risks  to  the  health  of  the  minor  are \nsignificantly  less  for  abortion  than  they  are  for  carrying  the \npregnancy to term and giving birth.  \n35.     Doctors do not inform their patients of every risk that \ncould  possibly  be  associated  with  a  procedure.   They  select  those \nrisks  that  are  significant  enough  to  warrant  consideration.   This \npractice is a commonly accepted exercise of professional judgment.   \n36.     Both sides presented extensive evidence on the risks or \nlack  thereof  of  abortion.   This  court  concludes  that  it  is  not \ncapable  of  quantifying  the  risks  of  the  abortion  procedure.  \nFurthermore,  this  court  concludes  professional  judgment  and \nprofessional  ethics  of  medical  doctors  should  govern  which  risks \nshould be discussed.  In reality there are many potential risks, and \nit is not appropriate to discuss the entire litany of possibilities.  \nIt is for the doctors and not this court to prioritize the risks for \nindividual patients and discuss those that are medically warranted.\n[3]  \n  \n     37.      The  Alaskan  doctors  who  testified  in  this  case  were \nsubjected to extensive cross-examination on the subject of what risks \nthey  do  or  do  not  disclose  to  patients.   This  court  is  satisfied \nthese  doctors  reasonably  exercise  their  professional  judgment  and \nprofessional ethics in obtaining informed consent. \n38.     The skill and competency of the abortion provider may be \na risk factor in any abortion procedure.   \n39.    Specialized training is not required to perform abortions; \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 13 of 29\nany  medical  doctor  may  perform  an  abortion.   Hospitals  and \ndoctors are not required to report abortion complications.   \n40.  No  evidence  suggests  that  doctors  performing  abortions  in \nAlaska do not meet or exceed all medical requirements or are in any \nway  incompetent.  Thus,  in  Alaska,  patients  would  be  unable  to \nmeaningfully  differentiate  between  the  qualifications  of  abortion \nproviders.   \n                    c.     Obtaining Medical History \n This  court  finds  that  the  State  does  not  have  a  compelling \ninterest  in  receiving  complete  and  accurate  medical  histories  from \nminors who wish to obtain abortions, based on the following findings: \n41.      Doctors,  or  their  staff,  take  a  medical  history  of  a \npatient before performing an abortion. Indeed, doctors take a medical \nhistory from all patients they treat.   \n42.     It is common for patients of every age to give inaccurate \nor incomplete medical information relating to their medical history. \nDoctors do not rely solely on a medical history to obtain important \ninformation.   \n43.  Doctors  who  perform  abortions  review  medical  histories  for \nspecific information that relates to the abortion procedure.  Doctors \nalso  conduct  tests,  review  medical  records,  and  speak  to  the \npatient’s treating physician to discover this information.   \n44.     Many of the conditions that would increase the risk of an \nabortion  also  pose  an  increased  risk  if  the  patient  carried  the \npregnancy  to  term.   For  example,  doctors  who  perform  abortions  are \nconcerned  about  a  history  of  bleeding  disorders.   Doctors  are  also \nconcerned  about  bleeding  disorders  when  performing  an  amniocentesis\nor c-section or delivering the child.     \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 14 of 29\n45.     The medical doctors agree that more information about the \npatient  may  be  helpful.   At  times,  parents  may  be  helpful  in \nassisting  a  minor  with  providing  a  full  medical  history.   However, \nthere is no evidence that the failure to obtain complete and accurate \nmedical histories has substantially increased the risks of abortions \nor pregnancy-related care.   \n  \n                d.     Sexual Abuse \n This  court  finds  that  the  State  has  a  compelling  interest  in \nprotecting minors from sexual abuse, based on the following finding: \n46.      Physical  abuse  and  sexual  assault  are  related  to  the \nhealth  and  safety  of  minors.   Some  minors  have  older  partners  who \nhave committed statutory rape.   \nii.  Does  the  Act  further  the  interests  involved  in \nprotecting the health of minors? \n  \na. The Physical, Emotional and Psychological Health of \n  \nMinors \n  \nHaving  found  that  protecting  the  health  of  minors  is  a \ncompelling state interest, this court must next address whether the \nParental  Consent  Act  serves  that  interest  in  the  least  restrictive \nmeans possible.  This court concludes that it does not, based on the \nfollowing findings: \n     47.      In  addressing  physical  risks,  abortion  is  a  low  risk \nprocedure  in  comparison  to  pregnancy  and  childbirth.   The  physical \nrisks from abortion may be compared to other invasive procedures used \nto treat STD’s or administer prenatal care such as cone biopsy and \namniocentesis.  Full-term pregnancy and childbirth present a greater \nrisk to the health of the mother than abortion, particularly if the \nabortion  is  performed  early  in  the  pregnancy.   The  risks  to  the \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 15 of 29\nmother increase as the period of gestation increases.  \n    48.     There are medical conditions that place the mother’s life \nand the fetus’ viability at risk.  This court considered evidence by \nthe  doctors  regarding  what  is  a  medical  emergency  and  found  a \ndifference of opinion regarding what level of risks must be present \nbefore  an  emergency  arises.   This  court  finds  that  a  medical \nemergency is a question of judgment by medical professionals and not \nsubject to precise definition.   \n    49.     The Alaska Parental Consent Act allows doctors to perform \nabortions on minors without parental consent or judicial approval if \nthe  situation  is  a  “medical  emergency,”  which  is  defined  as  a \ncondition  that  “so  complicates  the  medical  condition  of  a  pregnant \nminor  that  (1)  an  immediate  abortion  of  the  minor’s  pregnancy  is \nnecessary to avert the minor’s death; or (2) a delay in providing an \nabortion  will  create  serious  risk  of  substantial  and  irreversible \nimpairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant minor.”  See \nsection 18.16.010(g).   \n    50.     A minor cannot, however, consent to an abortion to avoid \n[4]\na “medical emergency.”   Under the Act, the minor must wait until \nthe  situation  becomes  a  “medical  emergency,”  a  delay  that  will \nincrease the health risks of the abortion.  In other words, a minor \ncan make the decision to put her own life at risk without parental \nconsent, but the same minor cannot choose to avoid putting her life \nat risk by electing an abortion without parental consent.   \n    51.     It is difficult to measure the long-term emotional and \npsychological effects of pregnancy and abortion.  First, there is no \nway to separate the effect of the unwanted pregnancy from the effect \nof the abortion, making it difficult to say that the abortion was the \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 16 of 29\nevent that caused any existing emotional and psychological problems.  \nSecond, it is difficult to study the long-term effects of any single \nevent  because  there  are  so  many  intervening  events  in  a  person’s \nlife.   \n     52.      The  evidence  does  not  prove  that  there  is  a  causal \nrelationship between abortion and emotional problems.  Women who have \nunwanted  pregnancies  experience  a  number  of  complex  emotional \nreactions,  regardless  of  whether  they  decide  to  terminate  the \npregnancy.  Most of these responses are considered clinically normal \nresponses  and  not  psychiatric  illnesses.   The predominant  emotional \nresponse  experienced  by  minors  after  an  abortion  is  a  sense  of \nrelief.   \n    53.     Because it is undetermined how an abortion or a pregnancy \nwill adversely impact the emotional or mental health of a minor, it \nis difficult to assess whether the Alaska Parental Consent Act would \nhave a positive, negative, or nonexistent impact on the emotional and \npsychological health of the minor.   \n     54.   The  Act  is  not  narrowly  tailored  toward  ensuring  minors \nreceive  post-procedure  care.   The  Act  allows  for  a  judicial  bypass \nprocedure.  Once a judicial bypass is completed, there is no further \nmonitoring by a judicial officer.  A parent could be of assistance to \nthe  minor  if  the  parent  was  notified  about  the  abortion  after  the \nfact.   \n     55.      Parents  are  not  required  to  consent  to  other  medical \nprocedures posing risks of complications that may become serious if \nnot treated expeditiously.   \n56. The Act does not require that a minor have parental consent \nto receive prenatal care, nor does it require parental notification \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 17 of 29\nof a positive pregnancy test to ensure that the minor receives \nadequate prenatal care.  Prenatal care can be crucial to monitoring \npregnancy  complications  and  protecting  the  health  of  the  mother \nduring the pregnancy.  Delay in seeking prenatal care could increase \nthe risk to the minor if the mother has any number of preexisting \nmedical conditions.  These risks may manifest themselves during the \ntime when the pregnancy is not obvious. \n               b.     Informed Consent   \nHaving found that ensuring doctors obtain informed consent is a \ncompelling state interest, this court must next address whether the \nAct  serves  the  interest  in  the  least  restrictive  means  possible.  \nThis court finds that it does not, based on the following: \n     57.      The  evidence  does  not  show  that  the  Act  will  promote \ninformed consent.  Parental consent, or in the alternative, having a \njudicial bypass procedure, will not foster informed consent.  It will \nremove  the  right  of  the  patient  to  consent  and  place  that  consent \nwith a third party.  The interest at issue here is related to the \ninterest  expressed  in  the  immaturity  of  some  minors.   For  those \nminors  deemed  “immature,”  having  an  adult  consent  may  facilitate \ninformed consent to make sure that the child understands the risks.  \nThe  evidence  supports  that  doctors,  as  adults,  perform  that \nfunction.   \n    58.     Doctors are able to obtain informed consent from minors \nfor  other  invasive  procedures  related  to  pregnancy  including \namniocentesis and STD treatment.  Other statutes provide that minors \nare  the  decision-makers  who  provide  informed  consent  for  other \nmedical procedures.  See AS § 25.20.025 and AS § 08.65.140.   \n     59.      Regarding  informed  selection  of  a  medical  provider,  an \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 18 of 29\nabortion may not be performed unless “the abortion is performed by a \nphysician or surgeon licensed by the State Medical Board.”  See AS §\n18.16.010.   The  State  could  directly  address  the  qualifications  of \nabortion providers to meet their concern.   \n               c.     Medical Histories \nHaving found that the State does not have a compelling interest \nin  receiving  complete  and  accurate  medical  histories,  no  further \ndiscussion  is  necessary  as  a  less  than  compelling  interest  is \ninsufficient to burden a fundamental constitutional right. \n               d.     Sexual Abuse \nHaving  found  that  the  State  has  a  compelling  interest  in \nprotecting  minors  from  sexual  abuse,  this  court  must  next  address \nwhether  the  Act  achieves  this  end  in  the  least  restrictive  means \npossible.  This court finds that it does not, based on the following \nfindings: \n60.      There  is  direct  legislation  requiring  health  care \nproviders  to  report  abuse.   Many  victims  of  sexual  abuse  have \nintercourse not resulting in a pregnancy.  \n     61.      Furthermore,  minor  women  impregnated  by  adult  sexual \npartners are more likely to carry their pregnancy to term.   \n     62.      The  State  does  not  require  parental  consent  for \ncontraception or pregnancy tests.   \n    63.     The Act is over-inclusive.  Many minors are impregnated \nby legal consensual sex with partners their own age, yet these minors \nare included in the Act.   \niii. Conclusion \nMany  medically  invasive  procedures  related  to  reproductive \nhealth  can  be  consented  to  by  a  minor.   A  minor  who  is  not \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 19 of 29\nemancipated, but who is living apart from his or her parent may \ngive consent for medical and dental services. AS § 25.20.025 (a)(1).  \nA minor who is the parent of a child may give consent to medical or \ndental  procedures  for  the  minor  or  the  child.   AS  §  25.20.025(a)\n(3).    A  minor  may  give  consent  for  the  diagnosis,  prevention  or \ntreatment of pregnancy, and for diagnosis and treatment of venereal \ndisease.  AS § 25.20.025(a)(4).  A pregnant minor who is sixteen or \nolder can consent to have a delivery by a midwife.  AS § 08.65.140\n(17).  \nWith  regard  to  protecting  the  physical,  emotional,  and \npsychological  risks  of  minors,  the  Parental  Consent  Act  is  under-\ninclusive.  Again, the Act only burdens one set of medical risks, the \nrisks associated with abortions.  The Act does not burden other sets \nof medical risks, among them the risks associated with pregnancy and \nchildbirth.   The  risks  to  the  health  of  the  mother  that  are \nassociated  with  pregnancy  and  childbirth  are  higher  than  the  risks \nassociated with abortion.  If the purpose of the Act is to protect \nthe  health  of  pregnant  minors,  it  is  incongruous  to  burden  the \ndecision to choose the safer procedure, but allow minors to choose \nthe more dangerous course without parental consent. \nRegarding informed consent to a medical procedure and protecting \nminors from sexual abuse, the Act is not the least restrictive means \nof achieving those compelling state interests.  \nD.      Preserving  the  integrity  of  the  family,  including \nprotecting the rights of parents to raise their children \n  \ni. The Nature and Importance of the Interest \n  \n     This court finds that the State does have many interests, some \nof them compelling, in fostering and protecting the family structure, \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 20 of 29\nbased on the following findings: \n64.      In  asserting  a  compelling  interest  of  fostering  and \nprotecting the family structure, the State did not specify what they \nmean by “family structure.”  The term “family structure” is broad.  \n65.  In Alaska, other than the intact nuclear family, there are \nmany divorced families, single parent families, and minors raised by \nsurrogate parents who do not have legal guardianship.  There are also \nextended  family  structures  and  clans  that  are  part  of  Alaskan \ncultures.  These family structures are all different.   \n66.     Related to the interest of the family structure is the \ninterest  of  parents  to  raise  their  children,  including  assisting \nminors to make decisions. Again, this interest is difficult to define \nand  categorize.   As  discussed,  different  people  have  diverse  ideas \nabout  the  family  structure  and  the  parental  role.   There  is  no \nquestion, however, that the role is very different in the life of a \nvery young child than it is for minors of childbearing age.  When the \nchild is younger, the State’s interest is surely more compelling, and \nas the minor moves toward adulthood the role changes, and although \nthe  parental  role  is  still  very  important,  it  may  no  longer  be \ncompelling.   This  interest  and  dynamic  was  fully  explored  in  the \nsection dealing with the maturity of minor women to make decisions.   \nii.  Does  the  Act  Appropriately  Further  the  State \nInterest? \n  \n     Having identified a broad interest, looking at the specific Act, \nthe State has an important interest in preserving the integrity of \nthe  family  and  the  parental  role;  nevertheless,  the  following \nfindings are made in relation to the means-to-end fit: \n    67.     In a highly functional family with children living in a \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 21 of 29\nsupportive  environment,  with  open  communications  with  parents,  the \nparents  and  the  child  would  consult  on  all  important  matters \nincluding  pregnancy  and  abortion.   In  such  a  family,  the  Parental \nConsent Act would be irrelevant and redundant.   \n     68.      On  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  there  are  highly \ndysfunctional families, where the child has, in effect, no adequate \nparent, perhaps because of the parent’s alcoholism, drug addiction, \nor  emotional  disability.   In  such  circumstances,  the  parent  may  be \nabusive to the minor.  In such a situation, the Parental Consent Act \nwould not promote the purpose of improving “the parental role” and \nmay be detrimental to the minor.   \n    69.     There are also families in the middle, where the law may \nencourage  a  child  to  seek  parental  advice,  and  where  a  child  may \nmisjudge a parent's reaction.  In those instances where the reaction \nis  positive,  the  Parental  Consent  Act  may  foster  a  parent-child \nrelationship.  In certain instances, where the reaction is negative, \nthe  Parental  Consent  Act  may  adversely  impact  the  parent-child \nrelationship. \n     70.      The  evidence  does  not  support  the  conclusion  that \nparental consent would improve the family structure or the parental \nrole in the least restrictive way possible. \niii. Conclusion \nThe  family  structure  is  diverse.   Many  variables  influence \nfamily dynamics.  Fostering and preserving a healthy family structure \nis obviously important, but it is effectuated in very different ways \nin  different  families.    The  State  does  not  have  a  “compelling \ninterest,”  which  would  justify  intrusion  into  every  family  and  the \npregnancy  choice  of  every  minor  woman.   The  Parental  Consent  Act \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 22 of 29\nwould  only  peripherally  further  preservation  of  the  family \nstructure and parental role, and then only in certain families.    \n          E.     Protecting the rights to a civil action \ni. The Nature of the Interests \n     This court finds that protecting rights to a civil action is a \ncompelling State interest.   \nii. Does the Act Appropriately Further the Interest? \n  \n      Having  found  that  preserving  rights  to  civil  actions  is  a \ncompelling  State  interest,  this  court  must  next  ask  whether  the \nParental Consent Act furthers this interest in the least restrictive \nmeans possible.  This court finds that the statute does not further \nthe interest, based on the following: \n    71.     The State did not show that people have a difficult time \nsuing doctors for malpractice for abortion procedures.   \n    72.     The legislature can create causes of action and extend \nstatutes of limitation as necessary. No evidence supports the notion \nthat the Parental Consent Act will further the interest of protecting \nthe right to bring a civil cause of action. \niii. Conclusion \nThe Parental Consent Act does not further the rights to a civil \naction.    \nF. Promoting the social benefits of reducing teenage high-\nrisk sexual activity \n  \ni. The Nature of the Interest \n  \nThis  court  finds  that  regulating  sexual  behavior  is  an \nimportant, not compelling, interest and separate from the compelling \nstate interest of protecting the health and safety of minors.  This \nis based on the following finding: \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 23 of 29\n    73.     Reducing sexual activities of minors may have benefits, \nby  reducing  the  social  and  societal  costs  of  pregnancies,  births, \nabortions, and STD exposure.   \nii. Does the Act Appropriately Further the Interest? \n  \n     Having found that the State does not have a compelling interest \nin  promoting  the  social  benefits  of  reducing  teenage  sexual \nactivities, this court does not need to reach the question of whether \nthe Act furthers this end in the least restrictive means possible.  \nNonetheless, this court makes the following findings with respect to \nthe means-end fit of this important interest: \n     74.      The  evidence  suggests  that  teens  in  other  states  with \nparental involvement laws did not know about the law until after they \nbecame pregnant.  The evidence does not show that the Act will reduce \nincidents of unprotected teenage sex or have an affect on the teen \npregnancy rate or the rate of STD exposure or infection. \n    75.     There are other means available to the State that would \nbe  more  directly  tailored  toward  achieving  these  goals.   The  State \ncould address these problems with laws or funding to educate male and \nfemale minors about safe sex and birth control.   \n     76.      The  evidence  does  show  that  the  number  of  abortions \ndropped  in  the  states  with  parental  consent  or  notification  laws \nafter the enactment of the law.  There is evidence that some minors \nin  these  states  traveled  to  states  without  parental  notification \nlaws.  It is difficult to determine whether the teen abortion rate \ndropped  for  minors  from  states  with  parental  involvement  laws,  or \nwhether  the  teen  abortion  rate  dropped  inside  the  borders  of  the \nstates with parental involvement laws.   \n    77.     There is evidence that teen pregnancy rates dropped after \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 24 of 29\nthe enactment of parental involvement laws in other states.  However, \nthe  drop  in  the  teen  pregnancy  rates  in  states  with  parental \ninvolvement is consistent with a national trend in the reduction of \nteen  pregnancy  rates.   The  causal  connection  has  not  been \nestablished. \niii. Conclusion \nThe interests involved are not compelling and the Act does not \nfurther the interest by the least restrictive alternative.    \nG.              Judicial Bypass  \nThe  Alaska  Parental  Consent  Act  contains  a  judicial  bypass \nprocedure  as  an  alternative  to  parental  consent.   This  court  finds \nthat the judicial bypass mechanism infringes upon a minor’s right to \nprivacy and treats pregnant teens within Alaska differently, without \nany  corresponding  benefits  to  the  governmental  interests  discussed \nabove, based on the following:     \n     78.      Minors  in  Alaska  who  decide  to  have  an  abortion  face \nobstacles  to  obtaining  that  abortion.   These  obstacles  may,  among \nothers,  be  cultural,  emotional,  financial,  or  geographical.  \nAdditionally, the evidence does show that a minor living in a village \nin  the  Alaskan  Bush  faces  more  onerous  obstacles  to  obtaining  an \nabortion than a minor living in a city such as Anchorage.  \n    79.     If a minor desires an abortion and she decides not to \nspeak to her parents, or if the parents decline to consent, she will \nneed approval from a Superior Court Judge.  \n80.      These  minors  they  will  need  to  negotiate  the  judicial \nbypass  procedure.  It  is  likely  that  non-governmental  organizations \nsuch  as  Planned  Parenthood  will  assist  her  to  overcome  the \nobstacles.   She  will  need  to  file  the  petition  and  decide  if  she \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 25 of 29\nneeds the assistance of a court-appointed attorney to help her \nthrough  the  court  process.   A  few  days  later,  she  will  have  a \njudicial bypass hearing.  She will need to discuss her decision to \nhave  an  abortion  with  a  Superior  Court  Judge.   The  hearing  will \nlikely  take  about  15  minutes.   Experience  from  other  states  shows \nthat these applications are rarely denied.  The minor will then go to \na clinic to have her abortion. \n     81.      The  procedures  for  judicial  bypass  are  more  readily \naccessible  in  Alaska's  population  centers  such  as  Anchorage, \nFairbanks, and Juneau.    \n    82.     It will be more difficult for a minor in a Bush community \nto obtain a bypass.  She will have a more difficult time accessing \nthe judicial bypass forms, accessing the court system, accessing her \nattorney, and participating in the judicial bypass hearing.  The Act \ndoes allow a minor to participate by phone.  However, the minor will \nneed to find a private phone connection.  Minors in the Bush already \nface  logistical  obstacles  to  obtaining  an  abortion.   The  judicial \nbypass system will increase these problems, delay the abortion, and \nincrease the probability that the minor may not be able to receive a \nsafe and legal abortion.  \n     83.      A  minor  from  the  Bush  will  have  to  travel  to  a  major \npopulation center to get an abortion, pay for the abortion, and keep \nher  choice  private.   Throughout  the  process,  she  may  have  to  miss \nschool.  Some public school districts may have a specific attendance \npolicy that allows a minor to miss class to attend a judicial bypass \nprocedure and get an abortion.  However, she will need to disclose \nher decision to someone in the school administration or get a court \norder  that  gives  her  permission  to  miss  school.   Most  likely,  the \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 26 of 29\nhealth  care  professionals,  court  personnel,  OPA  attorney,  Superior \nCourt  Judge,  and  school  administration  officials  will  keep  the \nminor’s  decision  ‘confidential.’   However,  the  judicial  bypass \nprocedure will infringe on the minor’s privacy, as she will have to \nreveal  her  decision  to  numerous  strangers.   In  smaller  communities \nwithin  Alaska,  it  will  be  very  difficult  to  keep  the  decision \nprivate.     \n    84.     In some situations, the judicial bypass procedure may be \ndetrimental to the physical health of the minor.  The judicial bypass \nprocedure will cause some delay in obtaining an abortion.  The amount \nof delay will vary depending on the individual circumstance of each \nminor.   Generally, it would cause more delay for minors living in \nthe  Bush.   The  thought  of  going  to  court  and  discussing  their \ndecision  with  strangers  may  unnerve  some  minors  and  because  of \ncultural  differences,  may  have  a  greater  impact  on  a  minor  in  the \nBush.  This  may  cause  the  minor  to  delay  initiating  the  judicial \nbypass procedure.  Depending on the length of the delay, it may be \nmedically significant.  \n85.     The mechanics of the judicial bypass procedure may also \ncause some minors not to seek an abortion.   \n86.      The  experiences  of  other  states  such  as  Massachusetts, \nMinnesota, and Texas indicate that for those minors able to negotiate \nthe  system,  the  vast  majority  obtain  judicial  consent.   In  many \ninstances, the procedure is pro forma. \n  \nIII.     EVAUALTION OF THE EVIDENCE \nA large body of evidence was presented, most of it scientific \nand technical, in the form of expert opinions.  Lay witnesses with \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 27 of 29\nexpertise in particular fields also appeared before this court.  \n      While  much  of  the  testimony  was  helpful  in  understanding  the \ndispute, no one witness or opinion was dispositive of the issue.  It \nis interesting to note that many of the same experts have testified \nin  other  jurisdictions  where  the  parental  consent  issue  has  been \nlitigated.   \n      As  a  general  matter,  the  witnesses  are  all  credible,  to  the \nextent  that  they  all  believed  in  the  opinions  they  presented.  \nUnfortunately,  on  both  sides,  the  opinions  were  uniformly \npoliticized.  What was striking was the bias many of the witnesses \nhave  for  either  the  pro-life  or  pro-choice  position.   This  bias, \nreflected in many of the opinions presented, affected the weight that \n[5]\nshould be given to a particular opinion.   Lastly, there are many \nopinions expressed by the many well-qualified experts.  Indeed, this \ncourt has not in any other case come across such an all-star roster \nof learned witnesses.  Even so, the parties had experts to counter \neach  opposing  opinion.   In  many  instances,  the  subject  matter  is \ncomplex and the variables many; the best conclusion this court can \ncome up with is that the opinions on either side are inconclusive.   \n     In weighing the evidence, this court placed greater weight \non the testimony of qualified experts who have conducted independent \nresearch,  or  qualified  experts  who  by  training  and  experience  have \n[6]\nformed  opinions  based  on  personal  knowledge.    Next  are  the  lay \n[7]\nexperts that have some basis for their opinions.   Lastly, of least \nweight are the personal experiences of witnesses that weigh in on one \n[8]\nside or the other.   These witnesses recount an event that happened \nin  the  past,  and  from  the  specific  experience,  have  attempted  to \nextrapolate a specific event into a general occurrence.  \nhttp://www.alaskabar.org/opinions/ACF6455.htm 1/18/2007\n\nPlanned Parenthood Page 28 of 29\n  \nIV.     CONCLUSION \nApplying  the  standard  set  forth  by  the  Alaska  Supreme  Court, \nthis  court  concludes  that  the  Alaska  Parental  Consent  Act  and \nJudicial  Authorization  Act  fails  to  further  compelling  state \ninterests, using the least restrictive means.   \nTherefore, under State v. Planned Parenthood of Alaska, 35 P.3d \n30  (Alaska  2001),  the  Alaska  Parental  Consent  Act  and  Judicial \nAuthorization Act is unconstitutional. \n  \nDated October 13, 2003. \n  \n   \n                    __________________________  \n                            SEN K.

On May 2, 1997, HCS CSSB 24(Fin) (\"SB 24\" or \"’the\n17\nAct’’) was enacted. A true and authentic copy of SB 24 is\n18\nattached hereto as Exhibit A. The effective date of the act is\n19\nJuly 31, 1997. In pertinent part, this law prevents any\n2O\nunmarried woman under 17 years of age from having an abortion in\n21\nAlaska unless she has obtained the consent of a parent, guardian\n22\nor custodian or a court order authorizing this procedure. Any\n23\nperson who performs an abortion on a minor who has not complied .\n24\nwith these consent procedures is subject to criminal and civil\n25\nliability.\n26\n27\n28 03011\n\n1\n2. The Act requires that the minor seek consent or\n2\njudicial approval even if she is mature enough to make an\n3\ninformed decision, even if she will suffer physical abuse if she\n4\nwere to confer with a parent, even if she is pregnant as a\n5\nresult of incest, and even if the pregnancy poses athreat to\n6\nher health. No similar requirement is imposed where a minor\n7\nseeks contraceptive, prenatal care or testing, or even when she\nundergoes a cesarean section. Indeed, for more than twenty\nyears, no parental consent requirement has been enforced for\nminors needing abortions. With passage of SB 24, that has\nchanged.\n3. SB 24 will unlawfully interfere with a young woman’s\nfundamental right of reproductive choice. This law will prevent\nmany minors from obtaining safe abortions and force them into\ncontinuing their pregnancies to term even when this decision is\nadverse to their best interests. SB 24 will delay or impede\nothers from obtaining an abortion to the detriment of their\nhealth. Moreover, SB 24 discriminates against young women\nneeding abortions.\n4. The State of Alaska cannot show a compelling state\ninterest to justify enactment of this new law.\n5. SB 24 therefore violates the Alaska Constitution’s\nright to privacy, Art. i, sec. 22, its guarantee of equal\nprotection under the laws, Art. !, sec. i, its guarantee of due\nprocess under Art. i, sec. 7, its guarantee of equal rights,\n030I’’\n\n1\nopportunities and protection under Art. I, sec. i, and its\n2\nguarantee of freedom from discrimination based on sex, Art. i,\n3\nSecs. 1 and 3.\n4\n6. This Court has jurisdiction under AS 22.10.020. Venue\n5\nis appropriate in the Superior Court, Third Judicial District,\n6\nat Anchorage.\n7\nPARTIES\n8\n7. Plaintiff Planned Parenthood of Alaska, Inc. (\"PPA\")\n9\nis a non-profit corporation duly organized in accordance with\ni0\nthe laws of the State of Alaska and has its principal place of\nii\nbusiness in Anchorage, Alaska. PPA operates clinics in\n12\nAnchorage, Sitka, and Soldotna, where it provides services to\n13\nmore than 3500 patients per year, including young women under\n14\nthe age of seventeen. Included among services PPA provides to\n15\nits clients are family planning, pregnancy testing and\n16\ncounseling and referral on pregnancy options, including prenatal\n17\ncare, abortion and adoption. PPA also provides educational\n18\nservices to adolescents in schools and other institutional\n19\nsettings. PPA is a public interest litigant. It sues on its own\n2O\nbehalf and that of its patients.\n21\nS. Plaintiff Dr. Jan Whitefield is a physician licensed to\n22\npractice medicine in the State of Alaska. Dr. Whitefield is\n23\nboard-certified in obstetrics and gynecology and is the medical\n24\ndirector of Alaska Women’s Health Services in Anchorage. Dr.\n25\nWhitefield and other physicians at that facility perform\n26\n27\n28\n03013\n\n1\napproximately 1200 first trimester abortions per year; of these\napproximately five percent are provided to young women under the\n3\nage of seventeen. For fear of being abused, thrown from the\n4\nhome, or prevented from having abortions, some of these minor\n5\npatients who need abortions cannot seek consent as now required\n6\nunder SB 24. These patienti’ include unemancipated minors who\n7\nare mature enough to make an independent decision about abortion\nand minors whose best interests would be served by an abortion.\nBefore proceeding with these services, Dr. Whitefield provides\nhis patients with counseling on pregnancy options, and performs\nabortions on those patients whom he believes have made an\ninformed decision regarding their pregnancy. Under the new law,\nDr. Whitefield may be both criminally and civilly liable should\nhe provide abortion services to a minor who has not obtained\nappropriate consent or a court order approving the abortion. Dr.\nWhitefield is a public interest litigant who sues on behalf of\nhimself and his patients.\n9. Plaintiff Dr. Robert Klem is a physician licensed to\npractice medicine in the State of Alaska. Dr. Klem is the chief\nof obstetrics/gynecology at the Sitka Community Hospital and is\na family practitioner at the Sitka Medical Center. Dr. Klem\nprovides medical abortions to women in Sitka through seven weeks\nof pregnancy measured from the woman’s last menstrual period\n(LMP). Dr. Klem’s patients include unmarried and pregnant women\nunder the age of seventeen. For fear of being abused, thrown\n03014\n\n1\nfrom the home, or prevented from having an abortion, some of\n2\nthese minor patients who need abortions cannot seek consent as\n5\nnow required under SB 24. These patients include unemancipated\n4\nminors who are mature enough to make an independent decision\n5\nabout abortion and minors whose best interests would be Served\n6\nby an abortion. Before proc4’eding with these services, Dr. Klem\n7\nprovides his patients with counseling on pregnancy options, and\n8\nperforms abortions on those patients whom he believes have made\n9\nan informed decision regarding their pregnancy. Under the new\ni0\nlaw, Dr. Klem may be both criminally and civilly liable should\nii\nhe provide abortion services to a minor who has not obtained\n12\nappropriate consent or a judicial order approving the abortion.\nDr. Klem is a public interest litigant who sues on behalf of\n14\nhimself and his patients.\nI0. Plaintiff JANE DOES I-X are anonymous minor and\npregnant woman who may in the future seek abortion services\n17\nwithout complying with the consent or judicial bypass provisions\n18\nmandated under the new law. The rights and interests of\n19\nPlaintiffs Jane Does I-X with respect to autonomous reproductive\n2O\ndecisionmaking and access to safe, legal abortions may be\n21\nrepresented by the other named plaintiffs in this case.\nii. Defendant, the State of Alaska, represented by the\nAttorney General through the Department of Law, is charged with\nprosecuting physicians and others who provide abortion services\nin violation of the act. The State Medical Board is the agency\n03015\n\n1\ncharged with adopting procedures, regulations and standards to\nimplement AS 18.16.010, except for the forms for the complaint\n3\nand notice of appeal and court rules which are to be drafted by\n4\nthe Alaska Supreme Court under SB 24.\n5\nSUM~LARY OF SB 24\n6\n12. SB 24 prohibits p~sicians from providing abortion\n7\nservices to \"’an unmarried, unemancipated minor under 17 years\n8\nof age\" unless: (a) the minor’s parent, custodian or guardian\n9\nhas consented in writing to the abortion, (b) a court issues an\ni0\norder authorizing the minor to consent to the abortion without\nii\nconsent of the minor’s parent, guardian or custodian, and the\n12\nminor consents to the abortion, or (c) a court, by not acting,\n13\nconstructively authorizes the minor to consent to the abortion\n14\nwithout consent of her parent, guardian or custodian and the\n15\nminor consents.\n16\n13. Violations of the Act give rise to civil and criminal\n17\npenalties. SB 24 provides that any person who knowingly\n18\nprovides an abortion in violation of the consent or judicial\n19\nbypass provisions is subject to prosecution for a Class C\n2O\nfelony, punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment and a fine up\n21\nto $i000 and may be civilly liable to the minor, her parents,\n22\nguardian or custodian for compensatory and punitive damages.\n23\n14. The Act provides no exceptions to its mandates.\n24\nRather, SB 24 only makes available affirmative defenses to\n25\nprosecution or a civil action. Even then, the defenses are\n26\n27\n28\n03016\n\n1\nlimited. SB 24 provides for affirmative defenses where (a) the\n2\nminor gave the provider false, misleading or incorrect\n3\ninformation about the minor’s age, marital status or\n4\nemancipation and the provider did not have reasonable cause to\n5\nbelieve the minor was under 17, unemancipated and unmarried, or\n6\n(b) compliance was not possible because, in the good faith\n7\nclinical judgment of the physician, an immediate abortion was\n8\nnecessary to avert the minor’s death or to prevent a \"’serious\n9\nrisk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major\ni0\nbodily function\"    Under SB 24, a physician is subject to\nIi\npenalty even if provided misleading information as to the\n12\nconsent of the parent, guardian or custodian, or if the\n13\npregnancy presents a serious risk of substantial, but temporary,\n14\ncompromise of the minor’s physical health. In these\n15\ncircumstances, the Act does not provide a defense.\n16\n15. Under SB 24, to avoid the consent requirements, a\n17\nminor must proceed to court. She must file a complaint in\n18\nsuperior court alleging either that (a) she is \"’sufficiently\n19\nmature and well enough informed to decide intelligently whether\n2O\nto have an abortion without parental, guardian or custodial\n21\nconsent\", (b) a parent, guardian or custodian physically,\n22\nsexually or emotionally abused the minor or that the consent of\n23\nsuch person is \"’otherwise not in the minor’s best interest,\"\n24\nor both. The Court must strictly construe the minor’s petition\n25\nand consider only the grounds alleged in the petition. The\n26\n27\n28 030i7\n\n1\ncourt must accordingly deny the petition if the minor fails to\n2\nprove the asserted basis even if shows she is entitled to\n3\njudicial authorization.\n4\n16. Under SB 24, failure of the superior court to hold a\n5\nhearing within the fifth business day of the minor’s filing the\n6\ncomplaint constitutes a con@tructive order authorizing the\n7\ncomplainant to consent to the abortion.\n8\n17. SB 24 permits a complainant to request that the\n9\nhearing be held telephonically. However, the Act does not\ni0\nrequire the Court to accommodate the minor at the hearing,\nii\nwhether in person or telephonically.\n12\n18. Should the superior court hold the hearing, the minor\n13\nmust Prove her allegations by clear and convincing evidence. If\n14\nafter a hearing the court dismisses the complaint, the minor may\n15\nappeal to the Supreme Court. The minor must file a brief within\n16\nfour days of the notice of appeal being docketed. The Supreme\n17\nCourt must hold a hearing within five days after the appeal is\n18\ndocketed. Failure of that court to enter judgment within five\n19\ndays of docketing of the appeal constitutes a constructive order\n2O\nof the court authorizing the minor to obtain an abortion.\n21\n19. SB 24 states the court may not notify the parents,\n22\nguardian or custodian that a complainant is pregnant and seeks\n23\nan abortion and that judicial proceedings are to be done in a\n24\nmanner to preserve the anonymity of the complainant. The Act\n25\nalso states that the complaint and all other records pertaining\n26\n27\n28\n03018\n\n1\nto the action are to be kept confidential and are not public\n2\nrecords.\n3\n20. If a minor alleges abuse as a ground for judicial\n4\nauthorization, or during the bypass hearing evidence is\n5\nintroduced indicating that the minor has been subjected to\nabuse, the superior court mi~ order a preliminary investigation\n7\nto determine whether the minor is a child in need of aid (CINA)\n8\nunder A.S. 47.10.010, et seq. If the investigation results in a\n9\nCINA petition being filed, the minor’s parents must receive\nI0\nnotice of the CINA proceedings under A.S. 47.10.030(b).\nii\n21. SB 24 also.requires the court to appoint an attorney\n12\nif the complainant has not retained counsel. However, this\n13\nright to appointed counsel does not arise until after the minor\n14\nfiles her petition alleging the basis for the requested relief.\n15\n22. SB 24 was enacted over the veto of the Governor and\n16\ndespite an opinion letter from the Attorney General that the act\n17\nis \"’vulnerable to a successful challenge under the United\n18\nStates Constitution and will likely be determined\n19\nunconstitutional under the Alaska Constitution\"    A true and\n2O\nauthentic copy of this April 24, 1997 Attorney General opinion\n21\nletter is attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n22\n23. SB 24 repeals, in part, former AS 18.16.010(a) (3) which\n23\ncontained a parental consent requirement for minors seeking\n24\nabortions. That provision, however, has not been enforced since\n25\n1976 because the Department of Law opined repeatedly that the\n26\n27\n28\n03019\n\nI\nstatute was constitutionally infirm. As a result, the law has\n2\nnot been enforced since 1976.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n24. Women in Alaska, including minors, seek abortions for\n5\na variety of physical health, psychological, familial, economic\nand personal reasons.\n7\n25. In Alaska and throughout the United States, in the\n8\nmajority of cases, one or both of the minor’s parents know she\n9\nis obtaining an abortion. The younger the minor, the more\ni0\nlikely she is to involve a parent.\nii\n26. When minors do not involve a parent in deciding\n12\nwhether to have an abortion, they generally have compelling\n15\nreasons. Forced notice can lead to a number of serious adverse\n14\nconsequences, including, but not limited to, physical violence\n15\nagainst the minor, physical violence against other family\n16\nmembers, forced pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood (when the\n17\nparent prevents the minor from terminating the pregnancy), or\n18\nother types of parental retribution against the minor, such as\n19\nexpulsion from the home or other punishment.\n2O\n27. Minors who cannot involve a-parent in the decision\n21\nwhether to continue or terminate their pregnancies will take\n22\nextreme action to avoid parental involvement, including, but not\n23\nlimited to, suicide, obtaining illegal abortions, self-inducing\n24\nabortions, or carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. Each of\n25\nthese alternatives seriously risks a minor’s life and health.\n26\n27\n28\nI0\n\n1\nSome minors will travel to a jurisdiction where parental\n2\ninvolvement is not required, thus necessitating long travel\n3\nbefore and after surgery.\n4\n28. Minors tend to seek abortions later in pregnancy than\n5\nadult women for a number of reasons, including the increased\n6\nirregularity of their menstrual cycles, making it harder to\n7\ndetect their pregnancy, a greater likelihood of denying their\n8\npregnancies, and added difficulties in amassing.funds and\n9\narranging travel to obtain an abortion.\ni0\n29. Abortion at any stage of pregnancy is considered one\nii\nof the safest medical procedures. However, delay in the\n12\nperformance of an abortion increases the health risk that women\n13\nface in connection with the procedure. While the risks\n14\nassociated with abortion increase with gestational age, the\n15\nrisks of childbirth are twice the risk of an abortion after\n16\ntwelve weeks. At no time before 21 weeks do the risks of\n17\nabortio~ exceed those incurred with childbirth.\n18\n30. Abortions become more expensive the later in pregnancy\n19\nthey are performed, and there are fewer providers available to\n2O\nprovide the service later in pregnancy. In Southeast Alaska,\n21\nabor{ion services are not available after seven weeks of\n22\npregnancy. Alaskan women who seek an abortion after 14 weeks\n23\nLMP have limited options and often must travel outside the\n24\nstate.\n25\n26\n2~\n28\nii\n\n1\n31. The farther a woman has to travel to obtain an\n2\nabortion, the less likely she is to obtain one. Travel imposes\n3\nburdens such as increased cost and time on women seeking\n4\nabortions.\n5\n32. A requirement that all minors consult a parent,\n6\nguardian or custodian will ~rm minors. Some, if forced to\n7\nconsult a parent, will suffer harm inciuding abuse, eviction\n8\nfrom the home, or forced parenthood. In other instances, the\n9\nparent or other adult who may consent will be unavailable,\ni0\nleading to delay in the minor obtaining care, to the detriment\nii\nof her health.\n12\n33. The mandated parental consent requirements will not\n13\nfoster family structure. When a fundamental conflict exists\n14\nbetween a parent and a minor child, affording parents a veto\n15\npower over the minor’s fundamental right to reproductive choice\n16\nwill not remedy an already troubled relationship.\n17\n34. The mandated consent requirement also will not protect\n18\nthe health of minor women. Most minors seeking abortion\n19\nservices are sufficiently mature to provide informed consent in\n2O\nconsultation with their physician. In those limited\n21\ncircumstances where minors are unable to consult with their\n22\nparents on their medical needs, minors in consultation with\n23\ntheir physicians, other family members and other counseling\n24\nresources are able to best address the decision of whether to\n25\ncontinue or terminate the pregnancy. Physicians will not provide\n26\n28\n12\n03022\n\n1\nabortion services to those minors who cannot make such an\ninformed decision.\n35. For those minors who cannot obtain parental, guardian\nor custodial consent, the judicial bypass provisions does not\n5\nprovide an adequate substitute. The reasons include, but are not\n6\nlimited to, the following:\n7\n(a) Minors forced to pursue a judicial bypass will be\n8\ndelayed in obtaining care, asthey struggle to determine how to\n9\npursue a bypass, await a time when they can travel to court\ni0\nundetected by a parent or guardian, and pursue the bypass.\nii\n(b) The problems presented by.the bypass will be\n12\nparticularly great for minors in rural areas. They will face\nincreased hurdles attempting to travel to court and to do so\n14\nwithout detection from a parent or guardian. Should they get to\n15\ncourt, they risk being seen by a family friend or acquaintance,\n16\nand thus losing confidentiality. A telephonic hearing does not\n17\ncure these problems since a minor still must find access to a\n18\nprivate line, outside the home, during court hours.\n19\n(c) For all minors, the delay created by the bypass\nwill come at the expense of their health. The delay also will\nmake the abortion more expensive and less available. For some\nminors, the delay inherent in the bypass will prevent them from\nbeing able to obtain an abortion in Alaska. For still others,\neven attempting the bypass will be impossible, leaving the minor\nlittle choice but to continue the pregnancy to term.\n03023\n\n1\n(d) The specific bypass procedure under SB 24 burdens\nminors seeking abortions. The act’s strict pleading\n3\nrequirements.will infringe on a minor’s right of reproductive\n4\nchoice, by causing the court to deny some minors bypasses to\n5\nwhich they would be entitled but for these strictures.\n(e) The standard of proof required by the Act will\n7\nimpermissibly restrict minors’ access to abortion.\n8\n(f) The Act burdens the minor’s right to\n9\nconfidentiality for the grounds set forth above and by\ni0\npermitting the court to trigger a CINA investigation under AS\nIi\n47.10. et seq. when, in the course of a bypass, the minor\n12\ndiscloses abuse.\n13\n(g) A requirement of a judicial bypass will not\n14\nfurther the minors’ health or otherwise serve a state interest.\n15\n(h) By its express language, the Act does not allow\n16\nthe court to address whether the abortion is in the best\n17\ninterest of the minor.\n18\n(i) The Act precludes the court from providing\n19\nsubstitute consent for an abortion procedure for a minor whom\n2O\nthe court finds is insufficiently mature to make this decision\n21\nif the Court concludes that the minor’s best interest is served\n22\nby obtaining parental consent.\n25\n36. SB 24 will impair a minor’s exercise of her right of\n24\nreproductive choice by deterring physicians from providing\n25\nabortion services. Physicians will be chilled from providing\n26\n27\n03024\n28\n14\n\ncare for reasons including but not limited to the act’s failure\nto provide a life and health exception to civil or criminal\n3\nprosecution, the act’s limited and vague definition of medical\n4\nemergency, and the act’s failure to include as a defense fraud\n5\nor misrepresentation as to the provision of parental consent.\n6\n37. The inadequacie~ of the judicial bypass provision will\n7\nresult in some minors being forced to leave the State to obtain\n8\nan abortion. These young women will face not only prohibitive\n9\nexpenses, but possibly substantial risks to their health from\ni0\nundue delay in access to these medical services. Ot~er minors\nii\nmay simply.forego seeking an abortion rather than comply with\n12\nthe consent or judicial bypass provisions of the act and carry\n13\nan unwanted pregnancy to term. Others may resort to self-help\n14\nor inadequately trained persons to seek to terminate their\n15\npregnancies.\n16\n38. SB 24 will immediately and irreparably harm some\n17\npregnant minors by denying them the opportunity to obtain timely\n18\nand safe abortions. These young women will suffer the\n19\nirreparable harm of forced parenthood.\n2O\n39. For some minors in need of abortion services, SB 24\n21\nwill pose an insurmountable barrier because they do not want or\n22\ncannot obtain parental or guardian consent, they are fearful of\n23\nthe judicial bypass procedure, they cannot satisfy those\n24\nrequirements in a timely fashion, or they cannot locate\n25\n26\n27\n28\n15\n03025.\n\nphysicians to perform abortions due to provider reluctance to\ncontinue to provide abortion services.\n40. SB 24 subjects minors choosing to terminate their\npregnancies to unique burdens. Under Alaska law, unemancipated\nminors under the age of seventeen can obtain other medical\nservices and exercise other ~rivileges and rights, including the\nright to carry a pregnancy to term, without being required to\nobtain parental consent or satisfy a judicial bypass provision.\nMinors choosing to carry a pregnancy can obtain prenatal\nservices, invasive testing and even cesarean sections without\nparental consent or court order. Minors also may obtain\ntreatment for venereal disease, among other services, without\nparental consent.\nCOUNT I -- CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY\n41. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set\nforth in pars. 1-40 above.\n42. SB 24 unlawfully infringes upon a minor’s right to\nreproductive choice under the Alaska Constitution’s right to\nprivacy, article i, sec. 22. That constitutional section is\ninterpreted by the Alaska Courts to provide privacy protection\ngreater than that afforded under the U.S. Constitution.\nCOUNT II -- EQUAL PROTECTION\n43. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations\nset forth in pars. 1-42 above.\n03026\n\ni\n44. SB 24 violates the equal protection and inherent\nrights clause of Art. i, Sec. i, of the Alaska Constitution by\n3\nunjustly discriminating among suspect and arbitrary\n4\nclassifications, including but not limited to, between those\n5\nminors who reside in rural areas and those who reside in urban\n6\nareas, between those minors who reside in areas with ready\n7\naccess to the courts and those who do not, between those minors\n8\nwho seek abortion services and those who seek to carry their\n9\npregnancies to term, between those minors who seek abortion\ni0\nservices and those minors who seek other services, between those\nii\npersons under age 17 and those persons who are older, and\n12\nbetween those persons who are married and emancipated and those\n13\npersons who are not. SB 24 also discriminates against young\n14\nwomen based on their residency, marital status, pregnancy,\n15\nmedical needs and sex.\n16\nCOUNT III -- DUE PROCESS\n17\n45. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations\n18\nset forth in pars. 1-44 above.\n19\n46. SB 24 violates the due process clause of Art. i, sec.\n2O\n7 of the Alaska Constitution denies substantive due process\n21\nbecause this law is not substantially related to any lawful,\n22\nvalid purpose and it is unconstitutionally vague.\n23\nCOUNT IV -- VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL CIVIL RIGHTS\n24\n47. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations\n25\nset forth in paragraphs 1-46 above.\n26\n28\n17\n\n48. SB 24 violates the civil rights of plaintiffs\nprotected by the Alaska Constitution, Article I, section 3,\nwhich provides, in relevant part, that \"-[n]o person is to be\ndenied the enjoyment of any civil or political right because of\nsex ’’ by imposing substantial restrictions on the\nconstitutional rights of young women.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWherefore, plaintiffs pray for the following relief:\ni. That the Court issue a judgment declaring that SB 24 is\nunlawful and void under the Alaska Constitution;\n2. That the Court issue an injunction permanently restraining\nthe State of Alaska and its agencies and instrumentalities from\nimplementing or enforcing this act;\n3. That the Court declare plaintiffs are public interest\nlitigants;\n4. That the Court award plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs;\nand\n5. That the Court award plaintiffs such other relief as it deems\njust.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court\nenter judgment in their favor on the claims made and for the\nrelief requested in this complaint.\nIIIII\n03028\n\n1\nDated this ~ ~ day of July, 1997.\n3\nATTORNEYS    FOR PLAINTIFFS\n4\n5\nJ~yce E.
