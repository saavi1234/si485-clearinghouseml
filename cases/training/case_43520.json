    "summary": "<p>On November 20, 2019, the Community Success Initiative, Justice Served N.C., and the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP filed suit against the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, the North Carolina Board of Elections (\"N.C. Board of Elections\"), and other relevant state officials in North Carolina's Wake County Superior Court, challenging a requirement that people with previous felony convictions complete probation or post-release supervision and pay all court fines and fees to be eligible to vote. On November 20, 2019, Wash Away Unemployment NC and six individuals with previous felony convictions seeking to vote in North Carolina joined as plaintiffs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>North Carolina's felony disenfranchisement statute N.C.G.S. &sect; 13-1 provided that people convicted of a felony will not have their right to vote restored until they have been unconditionally discharged. In practice, this meant that people convicted of felonies who completed their prison sentence or were never sentenced to prison were unable to vote until the completion of their post-supervision release, probation period, or the payment of all fines and fees associated with their sentence. Plaintiffs alleged that these requirements infringed the North Carolina Constitution's Free Elections clause, Equal Protection clause, Freedom of Speech and Assembly clauses, and ban on property qualifications.</p>\r\n<p>Community Success Initiative, Justice Served N.C., and Wash Away Employment N.C. are non-partisan, non-profit organizations that assist formerly incarcerated people with reintegrating into society. These organizations diverted resources to educating and assisting their clients with registering to vote under North Carolina's felony-based disenfranchisement law. The North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP is also a non-partisan, non-profit organization that works to improve the political, social, educational, and economic status of minority groups. As part of this mission, the NAACP registers African American and people of color voters, the North Carolina NAACP diverted resources to education about and assisting potential voters in North Carolina understand the state's felony-based disenfranchisement laws. The six individual plaintiffs were North Carolinians convicted of felonies who served their incarceration time but remained unable to vote due to post-release supervision and probation. But for the felony-based disenfranchisement laws, these individual plaintiffs would have participated in North Carolina elections. Defendants, sued in their official capacities, include Timothy K. Moore, Speaker of the N.C. House of Representatives, Philip E. Berger, President Pro Tempore of the N.C. Senate, Damon Circosta, Chair of the N.C. State Board of Elections, Stella Anderson, Secretary of the N.C. State Board of Elections, Ken Raymon, Jeff Carmon III, and David C. Black, members of the N.C. State Board of Elections, and the N.C. State Board of Elections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative a preliminary injunction on May 11, 2020. On September 4, 2020, after amicus briefs from numerous civil rights organizations and other states, the majority of the three-judge panel consisting of Superior Court Judges Lisa C. Bell, Keith O. Gregory, and John M. Dunlow granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the application of the statute to people convicted of felonies on probation who were unable to register due to outstanding monetary obligations. Thereafter, the N.C. Board of Elections permitted people convicted of felonies to register if their probation had been extended for no reason other than failure to pay monetary obligations. Then, on August 27, 2021, the three-judge panel amended the preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from denying voter registration to any convicted felon on community supervision (probation, post-release supervision, or parole).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Defendants filed a motion for stay and appeal of the amended preliminary injunction on August 21, 2021. Then, on September 3, 2021, in response to the amended PI, the Defendants filed a petition for writ of supersedeas, writ of certiorari, and motion for temporary stay in the North Carolina Court of Appeals. In effect, Defendants sought to prevent the trial court's decisions in the case from taking effect and instead to delay any change to the felony disenfranchisement law until after the Court of Appeals and/or the N.C. Supreme Court reviewed the case. Defendants argued that the amended preliminary injunction impermissibly changed election law before a decision on the merits of the case and on the eve of an election. On the same day, the N.C. Court of Appeals granted the stay of the amended injunction. The N.C. Supreme Court upheld the stay on September 10, 2021, but only prospectively so that people convicted of felonies who registered under the amended injunction before the stay were allowed to remain registered and vote.</p>\r\n<p>On March 28, 2022, after a bench trial before the three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court, Judges Bell and Gregory issued a final judgment and order with Judge Dunlow dissenting. The Court held that the denial of franchise to convicted felons on parole, post-release supervision, or probation violates the N.C Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, Free Elections Clause, and fails strict scrutiny as &sect; 13-1 does not advance even an important government interest much less a compelling one. The Court permanently enjoined Defendants from preventing a person convicted of a felony from registering to vote due to probation, post-release supervision, or parole.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 26, 2022, the N.C. Court of Appeals, in response to the defendants August and September appeals, issued an order staying the trial court's March 2022 judgment and left in place the original September 2020 injunction that allowed people convicted of felonies who remained on probation solely because they had not paid all their outstanding fines to register for the May 17 and June 26 primary elections. After these primaries, the full March 2022 trial court judgment took effect. As of October 7, 2022, the trial court's judgment is in effect and pending a decision on the merits in the N.C. Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>",

In this litigation, Plaintiffs seek \na declaration that N.C.G.S. § 13-1, the North Carolina statute providing for the \nrestoration of rights of citizenship—which includes the right to vote—for persons \nconvicted of a crime, is facially unconstitutional and invalid under the North \nCarolina Constitution to the extent it prevents persons on probation, parole, or post-\nrelease supervision from voting in North Carolina elections. Plaintiffs also seek, in \nthe alternative, injunctive relief. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend Section 13-1 of our \nGeneral Statutes violates Article I, Sections 10, 11, 12, 14, and 19 of our \nConstitution.  \nBACKGROUND \n1.  Plaintiffs filed the initial complaint in this matter on November 20, \n2019, and an amended complaint on December 3, 2019. Defendants filed answers to \nand motions to dismiss the amended complaint in January 2020; the motions to \ndismiss were subsequently withdrawn. On May 11, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a motion \nfor summary judgment or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction.  \n2.  On June 17, 2020, this action was transferred to a three-judge panel of \nSuperior Court, Wake County, pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 1-267.1 and N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, \nRule 42(b)(4). On June 24, 2020, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina, pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 1-267.1, assigned the undersigned three-judge \npanel to preside over the facial constitutional challenges raised in this litigation.  \n3.  On September 4, 2020, a majority of the undersigned panel granted in \npart and denied in part Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, granted summary \n3 \n\njudgment in part to Defendants, and granted a preliminary injunction. The \npreliminary injunction was granted with respect to Plaintiffs’ claims under Article I, \n§§ 11 and 19 for those persons convicted of a felony and, as a result, made subject to \nproperty qualifications. \n4.  The following three claims remained for trial following the preliminary \ninjunction and summary judgment: \na.  that N.C.G.S. § 13-1 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nNorth Carolina Constitution by depriving all persons with felony \nconvictions subject to probation, parole, or post-release supervision, \nwho are not incarcerated, of the right to vote; \nb.  that N.C.G.S. § 13-1 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nNorth Carolina Constitution by depriving the African American \ncommunity of substantially equal voting power; and  \nc.  that N.C.G.S. § 13-1 violates the Free Elections Clause of the North \nCarolina Constitution.  \n5.  Trial on these claims was held in Wake County before the three-judge \npanel on August 16, 2021, through August 19, 2021. On August 19, 2021, the panel \nissued a clarifying ruling from the bench pertaining to the language on the forms \npromulgated by the State Board of Elections regarding voter eligibility in light of \nthe September 4, 2020, preliminary injunction. \n6.  On August 23, 2021, the panel orally issued an amended preliminary \ninjunction expanding the injunction entered on September 4, 2020, to enjoin \n4 \n\nDefendants from denying voter registration to any convicted felon who is on \ncommunity supervision, whether probation, post-release supervision, or parole. This \nOrder applied to individuals convicted in North Carolina state court and those \nindividuals convicted in federal courts. The amended preliminary injunction was \nfiled on August 27, 2021.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA. Facial Constitutional Challenges \n7.  “It is well settled in North Carolina that the courts have the power, \nand it is their duty in proper cases, to declare an act of the General Assembly \nunconstitutional—but it must be plainly and clearly the case. If there is any \nreasonable doubt, it will be resolved in favor of the lawful exercise of their powers \nby the representatives of the people.” City of Asheville v. State, 369 N.C. 80, 87-88, \n794 S.E.2d 759, 766 (2016)(quoting Glenn v. Bd. of Educ., 210 N.C. 525, 529-30, 187 \nS.E. 781, 784 (1936)); State ex rel. Martin v. Preston, 325 N.C. 438, 449, 385 S.E.2d \n473, 478 (1989).  \nB. Equal Protection  \n8.  Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro Hous. Dev. Corp. sets out the \nappropriate framework by which to analyze whether an official action was \nmotivated by discriminatory purpose. 429 U.S. 252 (1977). The North Carolina \nCourt of Appeals discussed this framework in Holmes v. Moore, 270 N.C. App. 7, 16, \n840 S.E.2d 244, 254 (2020). “[P]roof of a racially discriminatory intent or purpose” \nwill show “a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.” Id.  \n5 \n\n9.  Arlington Heights laid out a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to \nconsider. Id. at 18, 840 S.E.2d 244 at 254 (2020). Those factors include: (1) the law’s \nhistorical background, (2) the specific sequence of events leading to the law’s \nenactment, including any departure from the normal procedural sequence, (3) the \nlegislative history of the decision, and (4) the impact of the law and whether it bears \nmore heavily on one race than another. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68.  \n10.  Plaintiffs “need not show that discriminatory purpose was the ‘sole[ ]’ \nor even a ‘primary’ motive for the legislation, just that it was ‘a motivating factor.’” \nHolmes, 270 N.C. App. at 16–17 (quoting Arlington Heights). \n11.  “Once racial discrimination is shown to have been a substantial or \nmotivating factor behind enactment of the law, the burden shifts to the law’s \ndefenders to demonstrate that the law would have been enacted without this factor. \nAlthough . . . North Carolina caselaw generally gives acts of the General Assembly \ngreat deference, such deference is not warranted when the burden shifts to a law’s \ndefender after a challenger has shown the law to be the product of a racially \ndiscriminatory purpose or intent.” Holmes, 270 N.C. App. at 19 (quotation marks \nand citations omitted).  \n12.  The injury in an equal protection claim lies in the denial of equal \ntreatment itself, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. Holmes, 270 N.C. \nApp. at 14 n. 4. The fact that Plaintiffs may ultimately be able to comply with the \nrequirements of N.C.G.S. § 13-1 and vote is not determinative of whether \n6 \n\ncompliance with the requirements of N.C.G.S. § 13-1 results in an injury to \nPlaintiffs. See id.  \n13.  Further, North Carolina's Equal Protection Clause expansively \nprotects “the fundamental right of each North Carolinian to substantially equal \nvoting power.”  Stephenson v. Bartlett, 355 N.C. 354, 379, 562 S.E.2d 377, 394 \n(2002). “It is well settled in this State that the right to vote on equal terms is a \nfundamental right.” Id. at 378, 562 S.E.2d at 393 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n14.  If a statute interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right, strict \nscrutiny applies even if the affected group is not a suspect class. Stephenson, 355 \nN.C. at 379, 562 S.E.2d at 394; Northampton Cnty. Drainage Dist. No. One v. \nBailey, 326 N.C. 742, 747, 392 S.E.2d 352, 356 (1990). \nC. Free Elections Clause \n15.  The Free Elections Clause, Art. I, § 10, mandates that elections must \nbe conducted freely and honestly, to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the \npeople.  \n16.  Our Supreme Court has elevated this principle to the highest legal \nstandard, noting that it is a “compelling interest” of the State “in having fair, honest \nelections.” State v. Petersilie, 334 N.C. 169, 184, 432 S.E.2d 832, 840 (1993).  \n17.  North Carolina’s Free Elections Clause dates back to the North \nCarolina Declaration of Rights of 1776. Harper v. Hall, 2022-NCSC-17, P134 (2022). \nThe framers of the Declaration of Rights modeled it on a provision in the 1689 \n7 \n\nEnglish Bill of Rights stating that “election of members of parliament ought to be \nfree.” Id. (quoting Bill of Rights 1689, 1 W. & M. c. 2 (Eng.)).   \n18.  As the Supreme Court of North Carolina explained 145 years ago, \n“[o]ur government is founded on the will of the people,” and “[t]heir will is expressed \nby the ballot.”  People ex rel. Van Bokkelen v. Canaday, 73 N.C. 198, 220 (1875)). A \n“free” election, therefore, must reflect to the greatest extent possible the will of all \npeople living in North Carolina communities. Id. at 222-23 (the franchise belongs to \n“every” resident, as “government affects his business, trade, market, health, \ncomfort, pleasure, taxes, property and person”). \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nA.  The History and Intent of N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Are Rooted in Racial \nDiscrimination Against African American People and \nSuppression of African American Political Power \n19.  Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Vernon Burton serves as the Judge Matthew J. \nPerry Distinguished Professor of History at Clemson University. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. \n64:16-17; PX-27 at 1 (Burton Report); PX-28 (Burton CV). The Court accepted Dr. \nBurton as an expert in American history with a particular focus on the American \nSouth, race relations and racial discrimination in the American South, the Civil \nWar and Reconstruction, and the civil rights movement. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 76:8-23.  \nDr. Burton described the history and intent behind North Carolina’s felony \ndisenfranchisement and rights restoration provisions. The Court credits Dr. \nBurton’s testimony, as well as the materials on which he relied, and accepts his \nfindings and conclusions.   \n8 \n\n1.  The 1800s \n20.  Between 1835 and 1868, North Carolina’s Constitution forbid African \nAmericans, including free African Americans, from voting. During this period, \nNorth Carolina did not have a disenfranchisement provision specific to felons, but \nrather excluded “infamous” persons from suffrage.  N.C. Const. Art. I, § 4, pt. 4 \n(1776, amended in 1835) (authorizing the legislature to pass laws for restoration of \nrights to “infamous” persons). Infamy could result either from a conviction for an \ninfamous crime such as treason, bribery, or perjury, or from the receipt of an \ninfamous punishment such as whipping. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 82:2-16; Joint Stipulation \nof Facts (“Fact Stip.”) ¶ 21 (attached as Exhibit 1 to the parties’ Proposed Joint Pre-\nTrial Order).       \n21.  In 1868, after the Civil War, North Carolina adopted a new \nConstitution as a condition of rejoining the Union. Approximately 15 of the 120 \ndelegates to the 1868 Convention were African American, and others were \nprominent advocates for equality.  8/16/21 Trial Tr. 97:4-15. The 1868 Constitution \nprovided for universal male suffrage, eliminated property requirements to vote, and \nabolished slavery. N.C. Const. of 1868, art. I, § 33; id. art. VI, § 1; Fact Stip. ¶ 24. \nThe 1868 Constitution did not contain a felony disenfranchisement provision.  \n8/16/21 Trial Tr. 97:23-25. \n22.  The 1868 Constitution, particularly its universal suffrage provision, \nprovoked a violent backlash by White supremacists, called the Kirk Holden War. Id. \nat 98:1-25. The Ku Klux Klan murdered African American elected officials and \n9 \n\nWhite Republicans and engaged in a campaign of fraud and violent intimidation of \nAfrican American voters. Id.; PX-27 at 24-26.    \n23.  As part of this backlash against African American suffrage, in the late \n1860s, White former Confederates in North Carolina conducted an extensive \ncampaign of convicting African American men of petty crimes en masse and \nwhipping them to disenfranchise them “in advance” of the Fifteenth Amendment.  \n8/16/21 Trial Tr. 83:22-93:2; PX-27 at 19-22. Contemporary newspapers \nacknowledged that the goal of this whipping campaign was to take advantage of \nNorth Carolina’s law in existence at the time that disenfranchised anyone subject to \na punishment of whipping. A January 1867 article in the National Anti-Slavery \nStandard explained that “in all country towns the whipping of Negroes is being \ncarried on extensively,” that the “real motive … is to guard against their voting in \nthe future, there being a law in North Carolina depriving those publicly whipped of \nthe right to vote,” and that “the practice was carried on upon such a scale at Raleigh \nthat crowds gathered every day at the courthouse to see the Negroes whipped.” PX-\n161. An 1867 article in Harper’s Weekly described “the public whipping of colored \nmen as fast as they were convicted and sentenced to be whipped by the court,” \ntaking place “every day during about a month,” and explained the purpose: “even if \nthe suffrage were extended to colored men,” those punished by a whipping “are \ndisqualified in advance.” PX-158; see also PX-159 (March 1867 Atlantic Monthly \narticle recounting same). Rep. Thaddeus Stevens described this vicious campaign on \nthe floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, explaining that “in one county … \n10 \n\nthey whipped every adult male negro whom they knew of.  They were all convicted \nand sentenced at once, and [the Freedmen’s Bureau official] ascertained by \nintermingling with the people that it was for the purpose of preventing these \nnegroes from voting.” PX-160 (emphasis added). Stevens understood that this tactic \nwould continue unless Congress stepped in and accordingly proposed a federal law \nbanning disenfranchisement “for any crime other than for insurrection or treason,” \nid., but it did not become law.  \n24.  As a consequence of their campaign to disenfranchise African \nAmerican men, White Democrats regained control of the General Assembly in 1870 \nand, by 1875, further gains enabled them to call a constitutional convention to \namend the 1868 Constitution. The “overarching aim” of those amendments was to \n“instill White supremacy and particularly to disenfranchise African-American \nvoters.” 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 100:2-6; see id. at 104:10-105:14. The amendments were \nratified in 1876 and included provisions banning interracial marriage and requiring \nsegregation in public schools. 1875 Amendments to the N.C. Const. of 1868, \nAmends. XXVI & XXX; Fact Stip. ¶ 25. Another amendment stripped counties of the \nability to elect their own local officials, including judges, giving that power instead \nto the General Assembly. Amend. XXV; Fact Stip. ¶ 25. The purpose of this \namendment was to prevent African Americans from electing African American \njudges, or judges who were likely to support equality. PX-27 at 31; 8/16/21 Trial Tr. \n104:10-105:14.  \n11 \n\n25.  Notably, the 1876 constitutional amendments also disenfranchised \neveryone “adjudged guilty of felony.” 1875 Amendments to the N.C. Const. of 1868, \nAmend. XXIV. The amendment further provided that such persons would be \n“restored to the rights of citizenship in a mode prescribed by law.” Id. This was the \nfirst time in North Carolina’s history that the State allowed for the \ndisenfranchisement of all persons convicted of any type of felony.  \n26.  In 1877, in the first legislative session after the 1876 constitutional \namendments were ratified, the General Assembly enacted a law implementing the \nfelony disenfranchisement constitutional provision. Fact Stip. ¶ 26. The 1877 law \nbarred all people with felony convictions from voting unless their rights were \nrestored “in the manner prescribed by law.” Id.; PX-52 at 519-20 (1876-77 Sess. \nLaws 519, Ch. 275, § 10); 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 108:19-110:6.     \n27.  For the method of rights restoration, the 1877 disenfranchisement \nstatute incorporated a preexisting statute from 1840 that governed rights \nrestoration for individuals convicted of the most heinous crimes—treason and other \n“infamous” crimes. Fact Stip. ¶¶ 23, 27. The 1877 statute took all of the onerous \nrequirements for rights restoration that had previously applied only to people \nconvicted of treason and for the first time extended them to anyone convicted of any \nfelony. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 112:20-113:10, 165:15-18.    \n28.  The 1877 law did not just disenfranchise people with felony \nconvictions, it also continued that disenfranchisement even after those individuals \nwere released from incarceration and living in North Carolina communities. \n12 \n\n29.  Extending the 1840 statute to apply to felonies meant that individuals \nhad to wait four years from the date of their felony conviction to file the petition \nseeking rights restoration. They also had to secure the testimony of “five respectable \nwitnesses who have been acquainted with the petitioner’s character for three years \nnext preceding the filing of the petition, that his character for truth and honesty \nduring that time has been good.” Fact Stip. ¶ 23. The witness requirement meant \nthat no one could petition for rights restoration until at least three years had \nelapsed since their release from prison. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 112:8-19. In addition, the \nextension of the 1840 statute meant that anyone convicted of a felony was required \nto individually petition a judge for the restoration of voting rights, and the judge \nhad unfettered discretion to reject the petition. Fact Stip. ¶ 23. Likewise, anyone \nconvicted of a felony was required to post their petition for rights restoration on the \ncourthouse door for a 3-month period before their hearing, and anyone from the \ncommunity could come in to oppose the petition. Id. Until 1877, these requirements \napplied only to people convicted of the most egregious crimes against the \ncommunity, like treason.  \n30.  The 1877 implementing legislation also created harsh new penalties \nfor voting before one’s rights were restored. PX-52 at 537 (1876-77 N.C. Sess. Laws., \nCh. 275, § 62). The legislation provided that a person who voted before their rights \nwere restored after a felony conviction “shall be punished by a fine not exceeding \none thousand dollars, or imprisonment at hard labor not exceeding two years, or \nboth.” Id. Dr. Burton described that penalty as “extraordinary for the time,” \n13 \n\nparticularly in light of the fact that the per capita income of African American \npeople in the South at the time was just $40.01. 8/16/201 Trial Tr. 113:12-114:2; PX-\n27 at 36. These penalties carry through to this day. Under current North Carolina \nlaw, illegally voting while on probation, parole, or post-release supervision is a \nfelony that carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. N.C.G.S. §§ 163-275, \n15A-1340.17. \n31.  The goal of the felony disenfranchisement regime established in 1876 \nand 1877, including the 1877 expansion of the onerous 1840 rights restoration \nregime to apply to all felonies, was to discriminate against and disenfranchise \nAfrican American people. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 114:10-19; PX-27 at 24-37.  \n32.  White Democrats drew on the success of the whipping campaign, when \nthey for the first time realized that they could use crime-based disenfranchisement \nas a tool to suppress African American votes and African American political power. \nId. at 95:16-96:2. The idea was to accomplish indirectly what the Fifteenth \nAmendment prohibited North Carolina from doing directly. The state constitutional \namendment was proposed by Colonel Coleman, a former Confederate who had been \ninstructed by his nominating county to lead a “crusade” against the “radical civil \nrights officers’ holders party,” i.e., the party that supported equal rights for African \nAmerican people. Id. at 100:25-102:5. The committee that prepared the 1877 \nimplementing legislation was chaired by Colonel John Henderson, another former \nConfederate who later would preside over the lynching of three African Americans. \nId. at 105:18-106:12. \n14 \n\n33.  The disenfranchisement regime capitalized on Black Codes that North \nCarolina had enacted in 1866, which allowed sheriffs to charge African American \npeople with crimes at their discretion, thus disenfranchising them. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. \n82:17-83:21.   \n34.  All the African American delegates at the 1876 convention voted \nagainst felony disenfranchisement; one explained that the “measure was intended \nto disenfranchise his people.” Id. at 103:15-104:9. A contemporary North Carolina \nnewspaper advocating for the provision stated in 1876 that “the great majority of \nthe criminals are Negroes” and that felony disenfranchisement would therefore tend \nto “restrain their race from crime.” PX-162; PX-27 at 31. White North Carolinians \ndeclared that “all Negroes are natural born thieves.” PX-27 at 33-34. Other \nDemocrats used coded language, like asserting that felony disenfranchisement was \nneeded to ensure the “purity of the ballot box,” signaling to all that their efforts \ntargeted African American voters. Id. at 25, 29-31.   \n35.  The 1877 law’s adoption of the requirement to petition an individual \njudge for restoration had a particularly discriminatory effect against African \nAmerican people considering the contemporaneous 1876 constitutional amendment \nstripping African American communities of the ability to elect local judges. The \njudges appointed by the Democrat-controlled legislature in the 1870s were White \nDemocrats who were committed to White supremacy and were unlikely to grant a \npetition to restore an African American person’s voting rights. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. \n111:12-112:7.   \n15 \n\n36.  Legislative Defendants conceded at trial that the goal of the 1870s \nlegislative enactments was to discriminate against African Americans:   \nSo now I’m going to turn to the second -- the second claim \n-- the second claim of plaintiffs that 13-1 has this \nimpermissible intent and purpose of discriminating \nagainst African American voters.  The plaintiffs here \npresented a lot of evidence; much of it, if not all of it, all of \nit, troubling and irrefutable.  You can’t -- I can’t say \nanything about a newspaper report that says what it says.  \nI can’t say anything about the history that is in the -- in \nthe archives.  What I can say is that the evidence that Dr. \nBurton presented certainly demonstrates a shameful \nhistory of our state’s use of laws, and with regard to \nvoting in particular, to suppress the African American \npopulation.  That I can’t -- I can’t contest that.  We never \ntried to contest that. \n \n8/19/21 Trial Tr. 176:19-177:7. \n \n37.  The Court reiterates its finding in the expanded preliminary injunction \norder: “As acknowledged by Legislative Defendants at trial, there is no denying the \ninsidious, discriminatory history surrounding voter disenfranchisement and efforts \nfor voting rights restoration in North Carolina.” 8/27/21 Order on Am. Prelim. Inj. \n(“Am. PI Order”) at 8.  \n38.  North Carolina’s decision in 1877 to disenfranchise people with felony \nconvictions even after they are released from incarceration and are living in the \ncommunity has remained unchanged to this day.      \n2.  1897 to 1970 \n39.  Between 1897 and 1970, the legislature made various small \nadjustments to the procedure for restoration of rights and recodified that law at \nN.C.G.S. § 13-1, but the substance of the law was largely unchanged. Individuals \n16 \n\nconvicted of felonies were still required to petition individual judges for the \nrestoration of their voting rights.  \n40.  In 1933, a change in the law instituted a requirement that felons wait \n“two years from the date of discharge” instead of four years from the date of \nconviction before they were eligible to petition for voting rights restoration. 8/16/21 \nTrial Tr. 121:1-12; LDX-46. And petitioners were still required to present five \nwitnesses who had been acquainted with them for the three years directly preceding \nthe restoration petition. LDX-1 (1969 version of N.C.G.S. § 13-1). Though the \nrequirements for rights restoration were slightly relaxed in certain ways during this \nperiod, none of those changes were likely to help African American people, who had \nbeen “effectively” disenfranchised by this time “by other means,” including North \nCarolina’s poll tax and literacy test established in 1899. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 173:13-\n174:1; PX-27 at 41. \n3.  The Early 1970s \n41.  In the early 1970s, the only African American legislators in the \nGeneral Assembly—two of them in 1971, and three in 1973—tried to amend section \n13-1 to eliminate its denial of the franchise to people who had finished serving their \nprison sentence. As Senator Mickey Michaux explained, the African American \nlegislators’ priority at that time, and the “priority” of the North Carolina NAACP, \nwas “automatic restoration applicable across the board—at the least, the restoration \nof your citizenship rights after you completed imprisonment.” PX-156 ¶ 15 (Michaux \nAffidavit).   \n17 \n\n42.  In 1971, Reps. Joy Johnson and Henry Frye proposed a bill amending \nsection 13-1 to eliminate the petition and witness requirement and to \n“automatically” restore citizenship rights to anyone convicted of a felony “upon the \nfull completion of his sentence.” PX-55 at 1; 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 132:2-133:16. But their \nproposal was rejected. Their proposed bill was amended to retain section 13-1’s \ndenial of the franchise to people living in North Carolina’s communities. In \nparticular, the African American legislators’ 1971 proposal was successfully \namended in committee to specifically require the completion of “any period of \nprobation or parole”—words that had not appeared in Rep. Johnson and Frye’s \noriginal proposal—and then successfully amended again to require “two years [to] \nhave elapsed since release by the Department of Corrections, including probation or \nparole.” PX-55 at 2 (Committee Substitute); id. at 6 (Odom Amendment); 8/16/21 \nTrial Tr. 134:10-135:12. The amendments also deleted the word “automatically” and \nadded a requirement to take an oath before a judge to obtain rights restoration. PX-\n55 at 2 (Committee Substitute). The 1971 revision to section 13-1 passed as \namended. It thus required people with felony convictions to wait two years from the \ndate of the completion of their probation or parole, and then to go before a judge and \ntake an oath to secure their voting rights. LDX-2 (1971 session law). \n43.  Rep. Frye explained on the floor of the North Carolina House of \nRepresentatives in July 1971 that “he preferred the bill’s original provisions which \ncalled for automatic restoration of citizenship when a felon had finished his prison \nsentence, but he would go along with the amendment if necessary to get the bill \n18 \n\npassed.” PX-56 (“Felon Citizenship Bill Gets House Approval,” The News & \nObserver (Raleigh, NC), July 8, 1971); see 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 138:14-19.   \n44.  In 1973, the three African American legislators were able to convince \ntheir 167 White colleagues to further amend the law to eliminate the oath \nrequirement and to eliminate the two-year waiting period after completion of \nprobation and parole, but they were not able to reinstate voting rights upon release \nfrom incarceration. LDX-6. Senator Michaux explained, with respect to the 1973 \nrevision, that “[o]ur aim was a total reinstatement of rights, but we had to \ncompromise to reinstate citizenship voting rights only after completion of a sentence \nof parole or probation.” PX-156 ¶ 16 (Michaux Affidavit); PX-175 at 85:22-24 \n(Michaux Deposition). “To achieve even that victory, we vehemently argued and \nappealed to our colleagues that if you had served your time, you were entitled to \nyour rights. Ultimately, what we achieved was a compromise.” PX-156 ¶ 16. \n45.  The record evidence is clear and irrefutable that the goal of these \nAfrican American legislators and the NC NAACP was to eliminate section 13-1’s \ndenial of the franchise to persons released from incarceration and living in the \ncommunity, but that they were forced to compromise in light of opposition by their \n167 White colleagues to achieve other goals, such as eliminating the petition \nrequirement. Both Henry Frye’s statement on the House floor and Senator \nMichaux’s affidavit makes clear that the African American legislators wanted \ndisenfranchisement to end at the conclusion of “prison” or “imprisonment.”  PX-56; \nPX-156 ¶¶ 15-17. But as Senator Michaux explained: “We understood at the time \n19 \n\nthat we would have to swallow the bitter pill of the original motivations of the law—\nthe disenfranchisement at its core was racially motivated—to try to make the \nsystem practiced in North Carolina somewhat less discriminatory and to ease the \nburdens placed on those who were disenfranchised by the state.”  PX-156 ¶ 18.   \n46.  Defendants have argued that the original 1971 bill proposed by the \nAfrican American legislators was ambiguous because it referred to restoration after \ncompletion of a “sentence,” and did not use the word prison. The Court rejects this \nargument. Henry Frye’s statement on the House floor made clear that that term \nreferred to a “prison” sentence, and there would have been no need to amend the bill \nto add “probation or parole” on Legislative Defendants’ theory. Defendants \nnonetheless suggest that the addition of the words “probation or parole” in \namendments to the 1971 bill simply “clarified” what the original bill meant all \nalong. The Court does not find this persuasive in light of Henry Frye’s \ncontemporaneous statement that he opposed the amendments and preferred the \noriginal language which he said he understood to mean the completion of a “prison” \nsentence. PX-56.  \n47.  In support of this argument, Defendants also point to a single \nambiguous sentence from Senator Michaux's deposition. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 199:5-\n200:4. When read as a whole, Senator Michaux's deposition and affidavit contradict \nDefendants' arguments. The deposition and affidavit conclusively establish—\nconsistent with the official legislative records and contemporaneous news report—\nthat the African American legislators intended and in fact initially proposed a bill to \n20 \n\neliminate the disenfranchisement of people on felony supervision. Id. at 200:9-20; \nPX-56; PX-156 ¶¶ 15-16 (Michaux Affidavit); PX-175 (Michaux Deposition).  \n48.  It was well understood and plainly known in the 1970s that the \nhistorical and original motivation for denial of the franchise to persons on \ncommunity supervision in the post-reconstruction era had been to attack and curb \nthe political rights of African Americans. PX-56 ¶ 14. It was also clear that section \n13-1’s implementation was mostly focused on and intended to negatively affect \nAfrican Americans’ political participation. Id. Indeed, the reason the NC NAACP \nmade a push to amend the statute was precisely because the law was having a \nmajor impact on African American’s registration opportunities. Id. No Defendant \ndisputed during trial that the legislators in the 1970s understood the law’s racist \norigins and discriminatory effects, nor did Defendants introduce any contrary \nevidence.  \n49.  Rep. Jim Ramsey, who chaired the House Committee offering the \ncommittee substitute adding back in the words “probation and parole,” openly \nacknowledged in 1971 that the provision governing restoration of voting rights was \n“archaic and inequitable.” PX-56. Rep. Ramsey provided no explanation for the \nCommittee’s decision to nonetheless preserve the existing law’s disenfranchisement \nof people after their release from any incarceration. \n50.  Defendants presented no evidence at any time during trial advancing \nany race-neutral explanation for the legislature’s decision in 1971 and 1973 to \n21 \n\npreserve, rather than eliminate, the 1877 bill’s denial of the franchise to persons on \ncommunity supervision.   \n51.  There was no independent justification or race-neutral explanation for \nretaining the rule from 1877 that denied the franchise to individuals after release \nfrom incarceration in the 1971 and 1973 amendments to section 13-1. 8/16/21 Trial \nTr. 148:10-18. That provision was added back without explanation. \n52.  As Legislative Defendants acknowledged at trial, racism against \nAfrican Americans remained rife in North Carolina, including in the General \nAssembly, in the 1970s. There were 3 African American legislators and 167 White \nones. PX-56 ¶ 10. Many of the White legislators openly held racist views. Id.  \nLegislators used racial slurs to refer to then-Reps. Johnson, Frye, and Michaux. Id. \n¶ 11. The Ku Klux Klan was active, arch-segregationist George Wallace won North \nCarolina’s presidential primary in 1972, and Jesse Helms was elected to the U.S. \nSenate. Id. ¶ 6; PX-27 at 47, 59; 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 128:15-16. An effort to repeal \nNorth Carolina’s racist literacy test failed in 1970.   \n53.  The “Law and Order” movement of the 1960s and 1970s painted \nAfrican American individuals as criminals and focused on increasing the severity of \ncriminal punishments. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 123:1-125:25; 126:25-127:19. As explained \nby the News & Observer in 1968 that, “[t]o many North Carolinians, law and order \nmeans keep the [n-word] in their place.” PX-168.   \n54.  North Carolinians clearly associated the expansion of voting rights for \npeople with felony convictions with the expansion of voting rights for African \n22 \n\nAmericans, even during the 1960s and 1970s. 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 128:17-129:6. A piece \nin the Asheville Citizen Times warned against the passage of federal “voting rights \nlegislation” on the ground that it would enable “unconfined felons” to vote, i.e., \npeople with felony convictions who were living in the community on probation, \nparole, or supervision. Id. The Chairman of North Carolina’s Board of Elections \nissued a statement in 1970 warning against amendments to the Voting Rights Act \non the ground that it would enable felons to vote. Id. at 129:7-22. Even in the 1970s, \npeople in North Carolina understood that maintaining felony disenfranchisement \n“is one way of … keeping African-American people from voting.” Id. at 130:7-16.  .   \n55.  The 1971 and 1973 revisions to section 13-1 carried forward three key \nelements of the original, racist 1877 legislation: the disenfranchisement of all people \nwith any felony conviction, not just a subset; the criminal penalty for voting before a \nperson’s voting rights are restored; and the denial of the franchise to persons living \nin the community after release from any term incarceration. Id. at 148:16-149:6. \nThe current version of section 13-1 continues to carry over and reflect the same \nracist goals that drove the original 19th century enactment. Id. at 149:7-15.  \nB.  Present Day Effect of N.C.G.S. § 13-1. \n56.  Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Frank Baumgartner serves as the Richard J. \nRichardson Distinguished Professorship in Political Science at the University of \nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill.  PX-1 at 1 (Baumgartner Report); PX-2 at 1 \n(Baumgartner CV). The Court accepted Dr. Baumgartner as an expert in political \nscience, public policy, statistics, and the intersection of race and the criminal justice \nsystem. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 9:22-10:7. Dr. Baumgartner addressed, among other \n23 \n\nissues, the number of persons denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, \nor post-release supervision in North Carolina, as well as the racial demographics of \nsuch persons, at both the statewide and county levels. All parties stipulated to Dr. \nBaumgartner’s main findings regarding the number of people on felony probation, \nparole, or post-release supervision, and many of his findings regarding the extreme \nracial disparities in disenfranchisement among African American and White North \nCarolinians. Fact Stip. ¶¶ 40-42, 46-56. The Court credits Dr. Baumgartner’s \ntestimony and accepts his conclusions. \n1.  Denial of the Franchise to Over 56,000 Persons on Community \nSupervision. \n57.  At least 56,516 individuals in North Carolina are denied the franchise \ndue to probation, parole, or post-release supervision from a felony conviction in \nNorth Carolina state or federal court. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 14:25-20:6; PX-3; Fact Stip. \n¶¶ 40-42. Of these persons, 51,441 are on probation or post-release supervision from \na felony conviction in North Carolina state court—40,832 are on probation and \n12,376 are on parole or post-release supervision, with some persons being on both \nprobation and post-release supervision simultaneously. PX-3; Fact Stip. ¶ 40. Based \non data published by the federal government, 5,075 individuals are denied the \nfranchise due to probation from a felony conviction in North Carolina federal court. \nPX-3; Fact Stip. ¶ 42 (data as of December 31, 2019); see also Fact Stip. ¶ 41 (5,064 \nindividuals as of June 30, 2020).   \n58.    In individual counties, the overall rate of disenfranchisement ranges \nfrom 0.25% to roughly 1.4% of the voting-age population. Id. at 20:19-22:16. \n24 \n\n59.  25 counties in North Carolina have an overall disenfranchisement rate \nlower than 0.48% (the 25th percentile and below); 50 counties have an overall \ndisenfranchisement rate from 0.48% to 0.83% (the 25th to 75th percentile); and 25 \ncounties have an overall disenfranchisement rate higher than 0.83% (the 75th \npercentile and above). 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 23:4-22. These numerical cutoffs at 0.48% to \n0.83% can be used generally to designate counties as having “low,” “medium,” and \n“high” rates of disenfranchisement. Id. at 23:23-24:3.   \n60.  In 9 counties—Cleveland, McDowell, Pamlico, Beaufort, Madison, \nSampson, Duplin, Lincoln, and Scotland Counties—more than 1% of the entire \nvoting-age population is denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, or \npost-release supervision. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. at 24:4-25; PX-1 at 10; PX-7; Fact Stip. ¶ \n46.   \n2.

North Carolina’s denial of the franchise on felony probation, parole, or \npost-release supervision disproportionately affects African Americans by wide \nmargins at both the statewide and county levels. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 12:16-19; PX-1 at \n3-4.  African Americans comprise 21% of North Carolina’s voting-age population, \nbut over 42% of those denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, or post-\nrelease supervision from a North Carolina state court conviction alone. 8/18/21 Trial \nTr. 27:20-28:14; PX-4; Fact Stip. ¶ 47. African American men are 9.2% of the voting-\nage population, but 36.6% of those denied the franchise. PX-1 at 7; Fact Stip. ¶ 50. \nIn comparison, White people comprise 72% of the voting-age population, but only \n25 \n\n52% of those denied the franchise. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 27:20-28:14; PX-4. These \nnumbers are the very definition of a racial disparity. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 28:3-4. \n62.  In total, 1.24% of the entire African American voting-age population in \nNorth Carolina are denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, or post-\nrelease supervision, whereas only 0.45% of the White voting-age population are \ndenied the franchise. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 28:15-29:12; PX-4; PX-6; Fact Stip. ¶ 48. The \nAfrican American population is therefore denied the franchise at a rate 2.76 times \nas high as the rate of the White population. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 29:13-22; PX-4. If there \nwere no racial disparity in the impact of section 13-1, that ratio would be 1.0. The \nAfrican American-White disenfranchisement ratio of 2.76 shows a very high degree \nof racial disparity in disenfranchisement among African American and White North \nCarolinians. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 29:20-30:2.  \n63.  Although more White people are denied the franchise due to felony \npost-release supervision than African American people in aggregate, this does not \naffect the finding that African American people are disproportionately affected by \nsection 13-1. Id. at 30:3-17. There are nearly 6 million voting-age White people in \nNorth Carolina, compared to fewer than 1.8 million voting-age African American \npeople. PX-4. Thus, to determine whether racial disparities exist, it is necessary to \ncompare African American and White rates of disenfranchisement, rather than \naggregate numbers of disenfranchised African American and White people. 8/18/21 \nTrial Tr. 30:3-17. \n26 \n\n64.  The statewide data reveal an extremely high degree of racial disparity, \nwith African American people denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, \nor post-release supervision at a much higher rate than White people. Id. at 34:24-\n35:9.    \n65.  Extreme racial disparities in denial of the franchise to persons on \ncommunity supervision also exist at the county level. PX-1 at 9-20. In 77 counties, \nthe rate of African Americans denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, \nor post-release supervision is high (more than 0.83% of the African American \nvoting-age population), whereas there are only 2 counties where the rate of African \nAmerican disenfranchisement is low (less than 0.48% of the African American \nvoting-age population).  8/18/21 Trial Tr. 37:8-17; PX-8. In comparison, the rate of \nWhite disenfranchisement is high in only 10 counties, while the rate of White \ndisenfranchisement is low in 53 counties. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 36:21-37:7; PX-8. These \nnumbers show the extreme racial disparities in denial of the franchise to persons on \ncommunity supervision. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 37:18-38:7.   \n66.  In 19 counties, more than 2% of the entire African American voting-age \npopulation are denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, or post-release \nsupervision. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 44:10-15; PX-9; Fact Stip. ¶ 49. In 4 counties, more \nthan 3% of the African American voting-age population are denied the franchise. \n8/18/21 Trial Tr. 44:21-24. In 1 county, more than 5% of the African American \nvoting-age population are denied the franchise, meaning that 1 in every 20 African \nAmerican adult residents of that county cannot vote due to felony probation, parole, \n27 \n\nor post-release supervision. Id. at 44:24-45:21. In comparison, the highest rate of \nWhite disenfranchisement in any county in North Carolina is 1.25%. Id. at 40:18-\n41:11, 45:22-25; Fact Stip. ¶ 49. These numbers, too, show the extreme racial \ndisparities in denial of the franchise to persons on community supervision. 8/18/21 \nTrial Tr. 46:3-17. \n67.  In 44 counties, the percentage of the African American voting-age \npopulation that is denied the franchise due to probation, parole, or post-release \nsupervision from a felony conviction in North Carolina state court is more than \nthree times greater than the comparable percentage of the White population. Fact \nStip. ¶ 51. \n68.  Among the 84 counties where there is sufficient data for comparison, \nAfrican Americans are denied the franchise due to felony probation, parole, or post-\nrelease supervision at a higher rate than White people in every single county. Id. at \n53:4-9; PX-1 at 15; PX-11. There is not a single county where the White \ndisenfranchisement rate is greater than the African American rate, and there are \nonly 2 counties where the rates are close.  8/18/21 Trial Tr. 53:10-16.  In 24 counties, \nthe African American disenfranchisement rate is at least four times greater than \nthe White rate. Id. at 54:2-14. In 8 counties, the African American \ndisenfranchisement rate is at least five times greater than the White rate. Id. at \n56:3-19. \n69.  In sum, North Carolina’s denial of the franchise to persons on felony \nprobation, parole, or post-release supervision has an extreme disparate impact on \n28 \n\nAfrican American people. At both the statewide level and the county, African \nAmerican people are disproportionately denied the franchise by wide margins. \n8/18/21 Trial Tr. 78:2-22. As Dr. Baumgartner aptly put it, “We find in every case \nthat it works to the detriment of the African American population.” Id. at 78:21-22. \n70.  Legislative Defendants’ expert Dr. Keegan Callanan opined that there \nis no racial disparity in denial of the franchise to persons on community supervision \nbecause “100% of felons of every race in North Carolina” are disenfranchised. LDX-\n13 at 3; PX-177 (Callanan Dep.). In its September 2020 summary judgment order, \nthe Court found that Dr. Callanan’s report was entitled to “no weight” because it \nwas “unpersuasive in rebutting the testimony of Plaintiffs’ experts, was flawed in \nsome of its analysis and, while Dr. Callanan is an expert in the broad field of \npolitical science, his experience and expertise in the particular issues before this \npanel are lacking.” MSJ Order at 8. Dr. Callanan’s opinions still are entitled to no \nweight.    \nC.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Denies the Franchise to Persons on Community \nSupervision Who Would Otherwise Register and Vote and \nLikely Affects the Outcome of Elections. \n71.  Of the 56,000-plus people denied the franchise due to felony \nsupervision, a substantial percentage of them—thousands of people—would register \nand vote if they were not denied the franchise. Given how close elections often are \nin North Carolina, excluding such large numbers of would-be voters from the \nelectorate has the potential to affect election outcomes. \n29 \n\n1.  Expected Voter Turnout Among People on Felony Supervision \n72.  Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Traci Burch is an Associate Professor of Political \nScience at Northwestern University and a Research Professor at the American Bar \nFoundation. PX-30 (Burch CV); PX-29 at 1 (Burch Report); 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 7:5-8. \nThe Court accepted Dr. Burch as an expert in political science, public policy, \nstatistics, and racial disparities in political participation. 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 13:20-\n14:10. Dr. Burch analyzed, among other issues, voter turnout and registration for \npersons who have been denied the franchise in North Carolina due to felony \nprobation, parole, or post-release supervision. Id. at 14:12-15:2; PX-29 at 3. The \nCourt credits Dr. Burch’s testimony and accepts her conclusions. \n73.  Section 13-1 prevents thousands of people living in North Carolina \ncommunities from voting who would vote if not for the disenfranchisement. PX-29 \nat 4; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 15:16-22. It would be reasonable to expect that at least 38.5% \nof this population under felony supervision would register to vote, and that at least \n20% of them would vote in the next presidential election if they were not denied the \nfranchise due to section 13-1. Many subgroups, including older voters, African \nAmerican voters, and women voters, may vote at rates higher than 30%. PX-29 at \n20-21; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 37:6-38:3.   \n74.  To examine the recent voter registration and turnout statistics of \npeople in North Carolina with felony convictions, Dr. Burch matched data on felony \noffenders from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (“DPS”) to voter \nregistration and history data containing information on all registered voters from \nthe North Carolina State Board of Elections. PX-29 at 8; 8/17/21 Trial Tr.17:10-22.                   \n30 \n\n75.  38.5% of North Carolinians currently on felony supervision had \nregistered to vote in the past, and about 20.1% of otherwise eligible voters now on \nfelony supervision, who were over the age of 18 and were not serving a sentence for \na felony conviction in 2016, voted in the 2016 presidential election. PX-31; 8/17/21 \nTrial Tr. 20:11-17. \n76.  39.8% of African Americans currently on felony supervision, and 38.5% \nof Whites, had ever registered to vote. Voter turnout was also similar between the \ntwo groups: 20.3% of African Americans currently on felony supervision, and 21.3% \nof Whites, voted in the 2016 general election. PX-32; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 21:7-24.               \n77.  Despite these similar registration and turnout rates, about 1.5 million \nAfrican Americans were registered to vote in North Carolina in 2016, compared \nwith 4.8 million Whites. The number of African American individuals on community \nsupervision that are denied the franchise under section 13-1 relative to the overall \nnumber of African American registered voters is almost three times as high as \nnumber of White individuals on community supervision that are denied the \nfranchise under section 13-1. PX-29 at 12; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 22:2-11. \n78.  Despite roughly similar turnout in the past among African Americans \nand Whites on felony supervision, the denial of the franchise to persons under \ncommunity supervision has a greater impact on African American voter turnout \nthan White voter turnout because African Americans are a smaller percentage of \nthe total voting-age population. PX-29 at 12; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 22:2-11.  \n31 \n\n79.  Dr. Burch also analyzed gender differences in the voting behavior of \nthe community supervised population. Her methodology likely produced \nunderestimates for turnout among women primarily because the matching \napproach will underestimate voter registration and turnout among women who \nchange their names because of entering or leaving a marriage. PX-29 at 13; 8/17/21 \nTrial Tr. 24:4-8. \n80.  Women registered in the past at higher rates than men: 43.1% of \nwomen currently on felony supervision had registered to vote in the past, compared \nwith only 37.3% of men. Turnout rates in the presidential election were also higher: \n21.8% of women currently on felony supervision voted in the 2016 general election, \ncompared with 19.6% of men. PX-32; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 24:9-21.              \n81.  The pattern of voting participation by age largely mirrors that of the \nbroader population: older individuals vote at higher rates than younger individuals \nand voting among younger cohorts in the community supervised population lags \nsignificantly behind voting among older people on felony supervision. PX-29 at 14; \n8/17/21 Trial Tr. 27:17-25. \n82.  Among people currently on felony supervision who were ages 18 to 29 \nat the time of the 2016 general election (about 39% of the community supervised \npopulation), 36.1% had ever registered to vote and 15.1% voted in the 2016 general \nelection. PX-34; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 25:19-23. Among those ages 30 to 44 at the time of \nthe election, 40% had ever registered to vote and 21% voted in the 2016 general \nelection.  PX-34; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 26:6-9. Among those ages 45 to 60 at the time of \n32 \n\nthe election, 48.2% had ever registered to vote and 30% turned out to vote in 2016. \nThose over the age of 61 at the time of the election reported the highest \nparticipation: 50% of these older persons had ever registered and 36% voted in the \n2016 general election. PX-34; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 26:10-25, 27:1-16. \n83.  The type of punishment a person received also impacted the voting \nbehavior of people under felony supervision. Among the overall community \nsupervised population, there is some small participation differences between people \nwho have served time in prison for a felony conviction and those who have not. PX-\n29 at 15; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 26:10-25, 27:1-16. Among those currently on felony \nsupervision who have never served time in prison for a felony conviction, 40.5% \nhave registered to vote in the past and 20.6% voted in the 2016 general election.  \nPX-29 at 15; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 28:19-25. In comparison, among those who have \nserved time in prison for a felony conviction in the past, 37.0% have registered to \nvote in the past and 19.7% voted in the 2016 general election. PX-29 at 15-16; \n8/17/21 Trial Tr. 29:4-10. \n84.  Of the 372,422 eligible North Carolina voters who have completed \ntheir felony probation, parole, or post-release supervision at the time of the 2016 \ngeneral election, 103,130 or 27.69% voted in the 2016 general election. PX-35; \n8/17/21 Trial Tr. 32:7-19. \n85.  Turnout among the group of people who had completed their felony \nsupervision at the time of the 2016 general election varied by demographic \ncharacteristics. African Americans in this cohort voted at a slightly higher rate than \n33 \n\nWhites (29.8% to 26.3%). Turnout among those under age 30 was lower (13.1%) \nthan that of the oldest group of voters (35.46%). PX-35; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 33:10-35.  \nPeople who had served only felony supervision without time in prison voted at a \nslightly higher rate than those who had served some time in prison (28.5 to 27.3%). \nPX-29 at 17; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 34:5-13.   \n86.  A substantial number of the 34,644 people who were eligible voters at \nthe time of the 2016 general election and experienced their first felony conviction \nand disenfranchisement after the election—20.4%—voted in the 2016 general \nelection. PX-29 at 18; PX-36; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 34:14-20, 35:16-20. Turnout rates \namong this group were lower than the population who had finished serving their \nfelony sentences at the time of the 2016 general election because this group was \ndisproportionately younger, with half of them under age 30 at the time of the 2016 \ngeneral election. PX-36; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 35:21-36:1-4. Among this group, those who \nexperienced their first felony conviction after age 61 voted at nearly three times the \nrate of those under age 30 at the time of the 2016 general election. PX-36; 8/17/21 \nTrial Tr. 36:14-21. \n87.  There is also a large disparity in turnout rates across punishment \ntype. Only 17.7% of people who would eventually serve time in prison voted in the \n2016 general election, compared with 22.7% of those would serve only a felony \nsupervision sentence with no time in prison. PX-29 at 20; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 36:22-\n37:1-5. \n34 \n\n88.  The Court accepts Dr. Burch’s conclusion that, based on her analyses, \nat least 20% of persons on felony supervision in North Carolina would vote in \nupcoming elections if they were not denied the franchise. The Court further accepts \nDr. Burch’s conclusion that important subgroups of this class of voters—including \nwomen, African Americans, and older people—would vote at even higher rates. PX-\n39 at 2; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 39:1-14, 40:10-16. \n89.  The Court agrees that Dr. Burch’s 20% estimate is conservative for \nseveral reasons: (1) the process of matching DPS files with election records \nunderestimates the registration and turnout of women because they may change \ntheir names due to marriage, divorce, or other life events; (2) the process relies on \nexact matching so typographical and other errors will cause false negatives; and (3) \nsome individuals may have moved out of state and thus are no longer eligible voters \nin North Carolina, or may have lived and voted in different states prior to their \nNorth Carolina conviction. PX-39 at 2; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 39:15-40:1-9. \n90.  Both voter turnout and voter registration are indications of future \nvoting behavior, and political scientists sort voters into two categories: “core \nvoters”—people who vote consistently in every election—and “peripheral voters”—\npeople who vote episodically in elections of high interest. PX-39 at 3; 8/17/21 Trial \nTr. 41:12-42:1-3. \n91.   Looking at only 2016 turnout data might accurately capture the voting \nbehavior of “core voters,” but ignoring registration rates and other data would \nunderestimate the extent to which “peripheral voters” might participate in a given \n35 \n\nelection if they were not denied franchise due to being on community supervision. \nPX-39 at 3; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 42:12-43:1. \n92.  Additionally, 22.6% of people currently on felony supervision who were \neligible during the 2012 general election voted. PX-39 at 4; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 43:16-\n21. \n93.  When Dr. Burch combined the data from the 2012 and 2016 elections, \nshe observed that the North Carolina felony supervision population is split into core \nand peripheral voters. PX-39 at 4; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 43:22-45:2. 18% of the eligible \npopulation voted in only one of the 2012 and 2016 general elections, but not both.  \nThese are peripheral voters. PX -40; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 44:16-19. Additionally, 13.7% \nof the people on felony supervision voted in both 2012 and 2016 elections. These are \ncore voters. PX-40; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 44:20-23.     \n94.  31.7% of people currently under felony supervision voted in one or both \nof the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. At least 20% of those currently on \nfelony supervision would vote in upcoming elections if they were not \ndisenfranchised. PX-40; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 45:3-17, 45:18-46:1-4. \n95.  People convicted of felonies who later completed a felony supervision \nsentence in North Carolina have turnout rates at or above 20% over the last three \npresidential elections. PX-39 at 6; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 46:20-48:19. At least 20% of \nthose currently on felony supervision would vote in upcoming elections if they were \nnot disenfranchised. \n36 \n\n2.  The Potential Impact on Elections \n96.  To evaluate whether the denial of the franchise to persons on \ncommunity supervision may affect election outcomes in North Carolina, Plaintiffs’ \nexpert Dr. Baumgartner analyzed recent statewide and county elections in which \nthe vote margin in the election was less than the number of disenfranchised persons \nin the relevant geographic area. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 89:4-17; PX-1 at 26. The Court \ncredits Dr. Baumgartner’s testimony and accepts his conclusions. \n97.  In 2018 alone, there were 16 different county elections where the \nmargin of victory in the election was less than the number of people denied the \nfranchise due to felony supervision in that county. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 91:19-92:3; PX-\n21; Fact Stip. ¶ 57. For instance, the Allegheny County Board of Commissions race \nwas decided by only 6 votes, whereas 68 people in Allegheny County are denied the \nfranchise due to felony supervision—more than eleven times the vote margin.  \n8/18/21 Trial Tr. 92:5-93:5. The Ashe County Board of Education race was decided \nby only 16 votes, whereas 125 people in Ashe County are denied the franchise due \nto felony supervision—nearly eight times the vote margin.  Id. at 93:21-94:2. The \nBeaufort County Board of Commissioners race was decided by only 63 votes, \nwhereas 457 people in Beaufort County are denied the franchise due to felony \nsupervision—more than seven times the vote margin. Id. at 94:3-11.   \n98.  The number of African Americans denied the franchise due to being on \nfelony supervision exceeds the vote margin in some elections.  For instance, the \nnumber of African Americans denied the franchise in Beaufort County (235) exceeds \nthe vote margin in the Beaufort County Board of Commissioners race (63).  Id. at \n37 \n\n94:12-95:10.  The number of African Americans denied the franchise in Columbus \nCounty (143) exceeds the vote margin in the Columbus County Sheriff’s race (43).  \nId. at 95:11-96:2.  The number of African Americans denied the franchise in Lee \nCounty (152) exceeds the vote margin in the Lee County Board of Education race \n(78).  Id. at 96:15-97:1. \n99.  People living in the community on felony supervision have an interest \nin the outcome of county elections, as does everyone. Id. at 93:6-20. That is \nespecially true of a county sheriff’s race. As Dr. Baumgartner explained:  \n[W]e all have an interest in every race.  Democracy \nmatters, but people in this case and the people in this \ncategory have a particular interest in the criminal justice \nactors, district attorney, sheriffs, judges, but they have an \ninterest in everything, but certainly a County Sheriff, you \nknow, runs the jail.   That’s an important function in \ncriminal justice, so people certainly have an interest in \nthose races in particular, the people of this cat- -- the \npeople that we’re talking about who are disenfranchised \nunder these policies. \nId. at 96:3-14. This Court agrees. \n100.  Legislative Defendants’ expert Dr. Callanan attempted to offer some \ncriticisms of Dr. Baumgartner’s analysis regarding the potential impact on election \noutcomes. Dr. Baumgartner explained why those criticisms are incorrect, id. at \n97:4-100:17; PX-25, and the Court once again concludes that Dr. Callanan’s report \nis entitled to no weight. \n101.  In addition to county-level elections, there are statewide races where \nthe vote margin in the election was less than the number of people denied the \nfranchise due to being on community supervision statewide. Id. at 100:18-22. For \n38 \n\ninstance, the 2016 Governor’s race was decided by just over 10,000 votes, far less \nthan the 56,000-plus people denied the franchise statewide. Id. at 100:23-101:13. In \n2020, two prominent statewide races were decided by vote margins that are only a \nfraction of the number of persons denied the franchise statewide. Id. at 101:14-22. \n102.  There are also many 2018 state House and state Senate races that had \na vote margin of less than 100 votes. Id. at 101:23-102:6; PX-22. Dr. Baumgartner \ndid not receive data that would have allowed him to calculate the number of \ndisenfranchised persons in each of these House or Senate districts. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. \n102:17-103:1. Nevertheless, the closer the margin of any election, the greater the \nchance that North Carolina’s denial of the franchise to over 56,000 persons on \nfelony supervision could affect the outcome of the election. Id. at 103:2-20.  \nD.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Does Not Serve Any Legitimate State Interest \nand Causes Substantial Harm. \n1.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Does Not Serve Any Legitimate State Interest  \n103.  As the Court noted in September 2020, in its interrogatory responses, \nDefendants initially put forward “numerous” possible state interests that section \n13-1 might be thought to serve. 9/4/20 Order of Inj. Relief (“PI Order”) at 9; see LDX-\n144; SDX-146. The Court at that time accordingly denied summary judgment and a \npreliminary injunction on Plaintiffs’ broader claims concerning the denial of the \nfranchise to all persons on felony supervision, noting that Defendants should have \nthe opportunity to offer “facts or empirical evidence” supporting those purported \nstate interests. PI Order at 9.   \n39 \n\n104.  Nevertheless, at trial in August 2021, Defendants failed to introduce \nany evidence supporting a view that section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people \non felony supervision serves any valid state interest today. \n105.  The State Board’s Executive Director testified that the State Board is \nnot asserting those interests to justify enforcing the challenged law today. PX-176 \n(excerpts from Bell 30(b)(6) Dep.). The State Board Defendants’ interrogatory \nresponse identified interests including “regulating, streamlining, and promoting \nvoter registration and electoral participation among North Carolinians convicted of \nfelonies who have been reformed”; “simplifying the administration of the process to \nrestore the rights of citizenship to North Carolinians convicted of felonies who have \nserved their sentences”; “avoiding confusion among North Carolinians convicted of \nfelonies as to when their rights are restored”; “eliminating burdens on North \nCarolinians convicted of felonies to take extra steps to have their rights restored \nafter having completed their sentences”; “encouraging compliance with court \norders.” Id. at 176:20-206:15. The Executive Director testified that the State Board \nis not asserting that the denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision \nserves any of these interests as a factual matter in the present day, and she \nadmitted that the State Board is unaware of any evidence that denying the \nfranchise to such people advances any of these interests. Id.   \n106.  Indeed, the State Board’s Executive Director conceded that striking \ndown section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision would \n“promote their voter registration and electoral participation.” Id. at 182:17-22.   \n40 \n\n107.  The State Board Defendants did not introduce facts or empirical \nevidence at trial supporting any assertion that section 13-1’s denial of the franchise \nto persons on felony supervision serves any legitimate governmental interest.   \n108.  The Legislative Defendants did not introduce facts or empirical \nevidence at trial supporting any assertion that section 13-1’s denial of the franchise \nto people on felony supervision serves any legitimate governmental interest.   \n109.  In closing argument, Legislative Defendants asserted that section 13-1 \nserves an interest in “creat[ing] . . . the finish line for when . . . the loss of rights is \nfinished, when it terminates.” 8/19/21 Trial Tr. 166:2-10. The Court does not find \nthis alleged interest persuasive or legitimate.  \n110.  Legislative Defendants also asserted in closing argument that section \n13-1 serves an interest in “t[ying] the restoration to the completion of the sentence,” \nincluding the completion of any period of supervision. Id. at 166:11-22. But \nDefendants did not support this circular logic with any evidence to justify why it is \na legitimate interest.  \n111.  To the extent Defendants still contend that the challenged scheme \nserves interests “requiring felons to complete all conditions of probation, parole, and \npost-trial supervision,” as they did in interrogatory responses, those interests are \ntautological.  Nor have Defendants introduced any evidence that withholding the \nfranchise encourages completion of post-release and probationary conditions, and \nthere is no empirical evidence to support such a claim in any of the scholarly \nliterature. PX-29 at 22-34 (Burch Report).   \n41 \n\n112.  To the extent Defendants still contend that the challenged scheme \nserves an interest in withholding restoration of voting rights from people with \nfelony convictions who do not abide by court orders, they have introduced no \nevidence that the prospect of disenfranchisement results in higher rates of \ncompliance with court orders, and there is no support in the scholarly literature for \nsuch a claim. Id. at 32. In any event, section 13-1 denies the franchise to people on \nfelony supervision regardless of whether they are complying with court orders and \nthe conditions of their supervision.   \n113.  Defendants have argued that the changes to section 13-1 in the early \n1970s served a valid state interest in eliminating onerous procedural requirements \nfor rights restoration, such as a requirement to petition a court with supporting \nwitnesses or swear an oath before a judge. See, e.g., 8/19/21 Trial Tr. 166:23-167:18, \n169:17-22. But those procedural requirements are not at issue in this case.  \nPlaintiffs instead challenge section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on felony \nsupervision.   \n114.  In any event, while the final decision to restore a person’s voting rights \nis no longer left to the discretion of a judge, there remains a number of discretionary \ndecisions, especially in sentencing, but also in whether to charge an individual, \nwhat offenses to charge, whether to reduce charges, and whether a plea offer is \nextended, that have a direct effect upon when a person’s right to vote is restored. \nAm. PI Order at 5. Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on probation, \nparole, or post-release supervision exacerbates the inequitable effects of that \n42 \n\njudicial discretion, because judges retain discretion in deciding the length of \nprobation and whether to terminate a person’s probation. Pursuant to N.C.G.S. § \n15A-1342(a), a court may place a convicted person on probation for the appropriate \nperiod as specified in N.C.G.S. § 15A-1343.2(d), not to exceed a maximum of five \nyears. And pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 15A-1342(b), a court has discretion to terminate \nan individual’s probation “at any time … if warranted by the conduct of the \ndefendant and the ends of justice.” See also Fact Stip. ¶ 44. The median duration of \nprobation for persons sentenced to felony probation in North Carolina state court is \nthirty months. Id. ¶ 43. \n2.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Does Substantial Harm  \n115.  In contrast to the absence of evidence that section 13-1’s denial of the \nfranchise to people on felony supervision serves any valid state interest today, the \nevidence establishes that such denial of the franchise causes serious harm to \nindividuals and communities, and in fact undermines important state interests \nincluding several of the interests put forward by Defendants.   \na.  Testimony of Plaintiffs’ Expert Dr. Burch \n116.  Section  13-1’s denial of the franchise to persons on felony supervision \ndoes not advance those interests put forward by the State and instead causes only \nharm.1  \n \n1 Much of Dr. Burch’s analysis of potential state interests in her report concerned \nthe effect of conditioning rights restoration on the satisfaction of financial \nconditions of supervision, which was no longer relevant at trial given the Court’s \nSeptember 2020 summary judgment order. \n43 \n\n117.  The scholarly literature does not support the claim that section 13-1 \n“eliminat[es] burdens” in ways that “promote the voter registration and electoral \nparticipation of people who completed their sentences.” In fact, section 13-1 may \neven decrease turnout. PX-29 at 36-37; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 58:4-13.   \n118.  Turnout among people aged 18-29 who had been convicted but \ncompleted supervision by 2016 (13.01%) was several percentage points lower than \nturnout of people in 2016 who were later convicted of their first felony (15.7%). PX-\n29 at 39; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 60:2-18. In other words, the experience of being denied \nthe franchise decreases turnout among an otherwise similarly situated population. \n8/17/21 Trial Tr. 64:8-65:2. \n119.  People who served probation sentences for misdemeanors are 15% less \nlikely to vote following their sentence, whereas people who served probation \nsentences for felony convictions (and thus were denied the franchise) are 40% less \nlikely to vote following their sentence. This 25% differential in turnout rates can be \nattributed to the experience of felony disenfranchisement. PX-39 at 9-10; 8/17/21 \nTrial Tr. 63:9-64:5. \n120.  The scholarly literature shows that the existence of felony \ndisenfranchisement laws themselves lead to widespread confusion and \nmisunderstandings among people with felony convictions about whether they can \nvote, even in states with automatic restoration. Audit studies have shown that, \ndespite official policies, local bureaucrats themselves can contribute to confusion \n44 \n\nabout voting rights by failing to respond to questions or by answering questions \nincorrectly. PX-29 at 37; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 58:14-59:1-5.    \n121.  A 2014 peer-reviewed study of North Carolina’s re-enfranchisement \nnotification procedures concluded that those procedures have no effect on \nregistration and turnout among people who have finished serving their sentences, \nincluding probation and parole. 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 59:6-60:1. The researchers \nconcluded that North Carolina’s forms and guidance “lacked clarity” and that the \ninformation tended to be lost or crowded out. Id. Although Defendants asserted that \nthe documents provided to people ending probation have changed since 2014, they \ndid not introduce any evidence that the documents used today are any clearer than \nthose used at the time of the 2014 study.   \n122.  Continued denial of the franchise to persons on community supervision \nhas a stigmatizing effect, and the scholarly literature concludes that felony \ndisenfranchisement hinders the reintegration of people convicted of felonies into \nsociety. Id. at 65:13-66:18. Felony disenfranchisement is among a long list of \nstigmatizing and wide-ranging collateral consequences for people convicted of \nfelonies, including civil restrictions on voting, officeholding, and jury service; \nemployment and occupational licensing, and even economic exclusions from welfare, \nhousing, and other public benefits. There are more than 35,000 such penalties in \nstate and federal law across the United States. Id. at 65:13-66:1; PX-29 at 40. \n123.  Denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision reduces political \nopportunity and the quality of representation across entire communities in North \n45 \n\nCarolina. The population of people on felony supervision who are denied the \nfranchise in North Carolina is highly concentrated into particular neighborhoods.  \n8/17/21 Trial Tr. 67:3-23. Felony disenfranchisement rates of young adults living in \ncertain neighborhoods in North Carolina is as high as 18 to 20 percent. Id. Such a \nhigh level of communal denial of the franchise can discourage other young people \nfrom voting, because voting is a social phenomenon. Indeed, turnout among eligible \nvoters is lower in communities with higher rates of denial of the franchise among \npeople living in those communities. Id. at 67:24-68:15. These communities are less \nlikely to be the subject of voter mobilization efforts by political parties, have less \nturnout, and have less political power and political equality as a consequence of the \ndenial of the franchise to people on felony supervision. Id. at 66:22-67:23, 68:16-\n69:17; PX-29 at 43. \n124.  Denial of the franchise to persons on felony supervision harms \nindividuals, families, and communities for years even after such supervision ends.  \nPX-29 at 45; 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 69:18-70:6. \nb.  Testimony from the Department of Public Safety \n125.  DPS documents given to impacted individuals about their voting rights \nare unclear and can easily lead to confusion. It is critically important for DPS \ndocuments to inform people about their voting rights in simple, clear, plain English \nterms, and it is critically important to confirm that affected individuals have \nreceived, read, and clearly understood any written materials provided to them about \ntheir voting rights. 8/19/21 Trial Tr. 70:1-20. But the DPS forms are not simple or \n46 \n\nclear, and they do not speak in plain English about the basic question of whether \nthe person is permitted to vote.   \n126.  One DPS form contains multiple lists of things that people on \nprobation are and are not permitted to do, but not one of those lists mentions \nvoting. Id. at 75:20-78:10 (discussing SDX-28). The form further states that “upon \ncompletion of your sentence,” your voting rights are restored,” but the “sentence” \nreferred to there is different than the “active sentence” referred to earlier on the \nsame page; one refers to probation and the other refers to incarceration. Id. at \n79:21-80:16. DPS does not have any policy directing probation offers to explain to \npeople on probation receiving this form that the reference to a “sentence” at the end \nof the form is different than the “active sentence” referred to earlier on the same \npage. Id. at 80:25-81:8. While this form may be clear to someone who has spent \ndecades working as a probation officer and top DPS official focused on community \nsupervision, it could easily confuse a person on probation. \n127.  Another DPS form designed to inform people about the restoration of \ntheir voting rights does not even use any iteration of the word “vote.” Id. at 90:15-\n91:14 (discussing SDX-15).   \n128.  DPS does not provide any information about voting rights to people \nbeing transferred from supervised to unsupervised probation. Id. at 93:20-94:4. Nor \ndoes DPS provide people with any information about voting rights (or anything else) \nupon completion of their unsupervised probation. Id. at 94:9-22. Despite her many \nyears of experience at DPS working on community supervision, Maggie Brewer. \n47 \n\nDPS’s Deputy Director of Community Supervision, testified that she does not even \nknow whether people on unsupervised probation are permitted to vote. Id. at 87:18-\n24, 94:5-8.    \n129.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision \ndoes not avoid confusion, but instead engenders it. If section 13-1 applied only to \npeople who were incarcerated, all people with felony convictions could simply be \ntold upon their release from prison that they are eligible to vote.   \nc.  Testimony from the State Board of Elections \n130.  In addition to confirming that the State Board is not advancing state \ninterests in support of the denial of the franchise to persons on felony supervision \ntoday, the State Board’s Executive Director also made it clear that such denial of \nthe franchise is very difficult to administer and leads to material errors and \nproblems. \n131.  For instance, according to a 2016 audit titled “Post-Election Audit \nReport,” in a data-matching process used by the State Board, 100 out of 541 \nindividuals who were initially identified as having voted illegally due to a \nfelony conviction were in fact eligible voters, based on further investigation. PX-50 \nat 408; 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 194:2-22. That is a false positive rate of nearly 20%. Id.  \n132.  The State Board uses a related data-matching process to identify \npeople convicted of felonies in North Carolina state courts who are registered voters, \nand these individuals’ registrations are then canceled. But when a voter is \nidentified by this data-matching process as being ineligible to vote based on a felony \nconviction, the State Board does not conduct any further investigation to determine \n48 \n\nthe accuracy of the persons identified in the data match as ineligible based on a \nfelony conviction. 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 195:5-23.   \n133.  Voter registration application materials used by the State Board of \nElections as recently as February of 2020 explained to voters that: “if [you \nwere] previously convicted of a felony, you must have completed your sentence, \nincluding probation and/or parole” but did not include the words “post-release \nsupervision” anywhere on the form. 8/18/2021 Trial Tr. 197:7-25; 198:1-11 \n(discussing PX-43 at 352). Multiple State Board guides providing instructions to \npoll workers from as recently as the 2020 elections likewise mention “probation or \nparole” but not “post-release supervision.” Id. at 201:1-25; 202:1-24; 203:1-3 \n(discussing PX-51 at 557, 559); 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 204: 24-25; 205:1-20 (discussing \nPX-46 at 256). The State Board’s Executive Director acknowledged that if a person \non post-release supervision asked a poll worker, “I finished serving my jail sentence \nor prison sentence but I’m on post-release supervision. Can I vote?” the poll worker \nmight consult the State Board’s instructions and conclude, incorrectly, that the \nanswer was “yes.” 8/18/21 Trial Tr. 203:20-25; 204:1-3. \n134.  A person on post-release supervision could truthfully answer the \nquestion poll workers are trained to ask, “Are you currently on probation or parole \nfor a felony conviction?” with the answer: “no.” Based on their “no” answer, that \nperson would be permitted to cast a ballot. Notwithstanding the voter’s honest \nanswer, the person could then be prosecuted for the crime of voting \nillegally.  8/18/21 Trial Tr. 205:17-25; 206:1-7. \n49 \n\nd.  Testimony of the Organizational Plaintiffs \n135.  The Organizational Plaintiffs’ testimony further demonstrates the \nharms caused by section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people living in the \ncommunity on felony supervision. \n136.  There is rampant confusion among persons on felony supervision about \ntheir voting rights.  For example: \na.  Dennis Gaddy, the Executive Director of Community Success \nInitiative, testified that CSI’s clients are often confused about \nwhether they are allowed to vote. 8/16/2021 Trial Tr. 53:8-9, 56:21-\n57:1-21. He further testified that when clients are disenfranchised \ndue to felony supervision, they cannot effectively advocate for \nthemselves, their families, or their communities. Id. at 58:16-59:16.  \nMr. Gaddy testified that during his seventeen years of educating \npeople convicted of felonies about their voting rights, he has \nwitnessed how not being able to vote causes many people to lose \nhope, and not being able to vote means that you do not have a civic \nvoice. Mr. Gaddy lamented that clients often feel frustrated on \nbeing required to pay taxes but not being allowed to vote. Id. at \n59:10-60:4. \nb.  Diana Powell, the Executive Director of Justice Served NC, testified \nthat section 13-1 is confusing, that many impacted community \nmembers are afraid to vote, and that due to frequent address \nchanges, many people are never informed that their rights are \n50 \n\nrestored. She testified that most people are unsure as to whether \nthey have a felony or misdemeanor conviction and are afraid of \nbeing rearrested for voting. 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 163:21-165:7. \nc.  Corey Purdie, the Executive Director of Wash Away \nUnemployment, testified that it is difficult to discuss voting with \nimpacted community members because it is difficult to convince \nthem that they are legally able to participate in the process. 8/19/21 \nTrial Tr. 45:3-7. In his interactions with impacted community \nmembers, Mr. Purdie finds that people are in fear of voting after \nincarceration due to the confusing nature of the law, and many fear \nbeing charged with another felony and facing even more prison time \nfor mistakenly voting under this law. Id. at 45:10- 46:2. Mr. Purdie \ntestified that in his community outreach, he finds that people are \nconfused and scared to vote “all the time.” Id. at 46:3 \nd.  Rev. T. Anthony Spearman, President of the North Carolina \nNAACP, testified that he explains the current felony \ndisenfranchisement law to NC NAACP members “all the time”; and \nthat the individuals he speaks to are often confused about whether \nthey are eligible to vote under N.C.G.S. 13-1. Id. at 20:15-23. He \ntestified that “the NAACP is very much concerned about helping \nthese persons be the best somebodies they can be, and they cannot \ndo that...without being mentored to know what their rights are.”  \n51 \n\nId. at 20:08-12. Rev. Spearman further testified that “the vote is \none of the most powerful nonviolent change agents in the world, \nand to rob a man or woman of their right to vote ... it’s just hard to \nconceive of, that we would do that.” Id. at 23:09-16.  \ne.  Individual Plaintiff Timmy Locklear also testified that confusion \nabout his eligibility to vote has kept him from voting in past \nelections. Id. at 30:18-30:23.     \n137.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision \nalso harms the Organizational Plaintiffs themselves, forcing them to divert scarce \nresources and interfering with the missions of their organizations. Fact Stip. ¶¶ 3-\n15; 8/16/21 Trial Tr. 58:4-59:16 (Mr. Gaddy); 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 165:23-166:7, 167:4-\n13 (Ms. Powell); 8/19/21 Trial Tr. 46:23-48:4 (Mr. Purdie); 8/19/21 Trial Tr. 17:23-\n20:19, 22:8-23:8 (Rev. Spearman). \n138.  Mr. Gaddy also testified movingly about the devastating impact that \ndisenfranchisement had on him personally after he was released from incarceration \nand living in the community on felony supervision. After release from incarceration, \nMr. Gaddy could not vote for another seven years because he was on probation. He \nlamented that he missed a lot of elections over those seven years and was \nparticularly devastated to miss the election of the first African American President \nin 2008. 8/16/2021 Trial Tr. 60:5-61:1-24. \n139.  Mr. Purdie had a similar experience. He testified that the fear and \nconfusion created by this law, combined with the carceral experience, creates a \n52 \n\nfeeling of hopelessness. 8/19/21 Trial Tr. 36:23-37:16 (Purdie). This law has a \nsilencing affect, making impacted people feel as if their voice does not matter. Id. at \n49:22-50:10. Mr. Purdie testified that to restore a sense of hope, we must unmute \nour impacted community members—we must restore their voice. Id. at 51:16-21. \ne.  Testimony of the Individual Plaintiffs \n140.  The testimony of two Individual Plaintiffs fully demonstrated the \nprofound damage that section 13-1 does to people living in communities across \nNorth Carolina.   \n141.  Timmy Locklear, a 58-old member native of Lumberton, North \nCarolina, now lives in Wilmington.  8/19/21 Trial Tr. 25:14-22. Since his release \nfrom prison in October 2019, he has worked directing traffic at the New Hanover \nCounty Landfill, and he never had any violations of the conditions of his post-\nrelease supervision. Id. at 28:11-19. Before his 2018 felony conviction, he \nparticipated in North Carolina elections, and he testified that he would have voted \nin the March 2020 primary elections if he were not disenfranchised due to post-\nrelease supervision. Id. at 30:6-31:1. When Mr. Locklear completed his post-release \nsupervision in July 2020, his probation officer did not talk to him about his voting \nrights or give him a voter-registration form, and they never sent him any forms in \nthe mail about voting. Id. at 29:1-30:5.  Mr. Locklear nevertheless re-registered to \nvote and voted in the November 2020 elections. Id. at 31:2-8. When asked why it \nwas important for him to vote, he testified: “It felt good. I hadn't voted in a long \ntime.” Id. at 31:9-11.    \n53 \n\n142.  Shakita Norman lives in Wake County, where she works as an \nAssistant General Manager at Jiffy Lube, takes care of her five children, and pays \nher taxes. 8/17/21 Trial Tr. 148:16-149:14, 154:20-23. She wants to vote, particularly \nfor members of the school board because all of her children attend Wake County \nPublic Schools. Id. at 148:25-149:5, 153:16-22. But she cannot vote because, due to a \nfelony conviction in 2018, she has been stuck on “special probation” for 2.5 years \nrunning. Id. at 152:9-25.  To complete her special probation, she must serve a total \nof 200 more days of “weekend jail.”  Id. at 151:02-13.  But she has not been able to \nserve any weekend jail since March 2020 because the jails are closed due to the \npandemic.  Id. at 151:18-152:5. Ms. Norman has now been on probation and thus \nprohibited from voting for nearly three years, even though she has had no probation \nviolations. Id. at 152:9-25. Ms. Norman does not know when she will be able to \ncomplete her required weekend jail days, or when she will be off probation and able \nto vote again.  Id. at 152:6-8, 154:14-16. She voted in North Carolina elections \nbefore her conviction, and she testified that she would have voted in the March and \nNovember 2020 elections if she were not disenfranchised. Id. at 153:3-154:5. When \nasked why she believes that people on felony supervision should have the right to \nvote, she testified:  \nWell, most people that’s like me, even though I’m on \nprobation, I still pay taxes, I go to work every day, I take \ncare of my family.  I should -- I should be able to have \nthat, to have that moment.  I should be able to say \nsomething, and I want people that’s in the future that’s in \nthe situation that I’m in to be able to have that voice and \nbe able to say something and it gets heard.   \nId. at 154:17-155:2. \n54 \n\nBased on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Court makes the following: \n \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n \nI.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s Denial of the Franchise to Persons on Probation, \nParole, or Post-Release Supervision Violates the North Carolina \nConstitution’s Equal Protection Clause \n1.  The Equal Protection Clause of the North Carolina Constitution \nguarantees that “[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor \nshall any person be subjected to discrimination by the State because of race, color, \nreligion, or national origin.” N.C. Const., art. I, § 19.   \n2.  It is well-established that North Carolina’s Equal Protection Clause \nprovides greater protection for voting rights than federal equal protection \nprovisions. Stephenson v. Bartlett, 355 N.C. 354, 377-81 & n.6, 562 S.E.2d 377, 393-\n96 & n.6 (2002); Blankenship v. Bartlett, 363 N.C. 518, 522-28, 681 S.E.2d 759, 763-\n66 (2009)). North Carolina courts have repeatedly applied this broader protection \nfor voting rights to strike down election laws under Article I, § 19. Stephenson, 355 \nN.C. at 377-81 & n.6, 562 S.E.2d at 393-95 & n.6; Blankenship, 363 N.C. at 522-24, \n681 S.E.2d at 762-64.   \n3.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision \nviolates North Carolina’s Equal Protection Clause both because it discriminates \nagainst African Americans and because it denies all people on felony supervision \nthe fundamental right to vote.  \n55 \n\nA.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Impermissibly Discriminates Against African \nAmerican People in Intent and Effect and Denies Substantially \nEqual Voting Power to African American People \n4.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision \nhas the intent and effect of discriminating against African Americans, and \nunconstitutionally denies substantially equal voting power on the basis of race. \n5.  To prevail on a race discrimination claim under Article I, § 19, a \nplaintiff “need not show that discriminatory purpose was the sole or even a primary \nmotive for the legislation, just that it was a motivating factor.” Holmes v. Moore, \n270 N.C. App. 7, 16, 840 S.E.2d 244, 254-55 (2020) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  “Discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the \nrelevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one \nrace than another.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \n6.  The legislature cannot purge through the mere passage of time an \nimpermissibly racially discriminatory intent. See Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. \n222 (1985) (striking down a felony disenfranchisement law originally passed with \nthe intent to target African Americans); see also Ramos v. Louisiana, 140 S. Ct. \n1390, 1410 (2020) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (“[W]here a legislature actually \nconfronts a law’s tawdry past in reenacting it[,] the new law may well be free of \ndiscriminatory taint,” but “[t]hat cannot be said of the laws at issue here.”).  \n7.  The legislature’s decision in the 1970s to preserve section 13-1’s denial \nof the franchise to people living in the community was itself independently \nmotivated by racism.   \n56 \n\n8.  There is no evidence to demonstrate that N.C.G.S. § 13-1 would have \nbeen enacted without a motivation impermissibly based on race discrimination, and \nthe Court concludes that it would not have been.  \n9.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people living in the community \non felony supervision was enacted with the intent of discriminating against African \nAmerican people and has a demonstrably disproportionate and discriminatory \nimpact.  \nB.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Impermissibly Deprives All Individuals on \nFelony Probation, Parole, or Post-Release Supervision of the \nFundamental Right to Vote. \n10.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 interferes with the fundamental right to vote on equal \nterms as it prohibits people with felony convictions from regaining the right to vote \neven while they are living in communities in North Carolina, so long as they have \nnot completed probation, parole, or post-release supervision. See Stephenson, 355 \nN.C. at 378, 562 S.E.2d at 393. \n11.  People on felony supervision share the same interest as, and are \n“similarly situated” to, North Carolina residents who have not been convicted of a \nfelony or who have completed their supervision. “The right to vote is the right to \nparticipate in the decision-making process of government” among all those “sharing \nan identity with the broader humane, economic, ideological, and political concerns \nof the human body politic.” Texfi Indus., Inc. v. City of Fayetteville, 301 N.C. 1, 13, \n269 S.E.2d 142, 150 (1980). North Carolinians on felony supervision share in the \nState’s “public [burdens]” and “feel an interest in its welfare.” Roberts v. Cannon, 20 \nN.C. 398, 4 Dev. & Bat. (Orig. Ed.) 256, 260-61 (1839).     \n57 \n\n12.  As the Court held in its preliminary injunction order in September \n2020, under Article I, § 19, when legislation is enacted that restores the right to \nvote, thereby establishing terms upon which certain persons are able to exercise \ntheir right to vote, such legislation must not do so in a way that imposes unequal \nterms. As allowed by Article VI, § 2(3), of our Constitution, the legislature has \nchosen to restore citizen rights—specifically here, the right to vote—to those with \nfelony convictions. But in N.C.G.S. § 13-1, it has done so on unequal terms in \nviolation of Article I, § 19.  \nC.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s Violation of Article 1, § 19 Triggers Strict \nScrutiny \n13.  Under Article I, § 19, strict scrutiny applies where either: (1) a \n“classification impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right,” or \n(2) a statute “operates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.”  Stephenson, \n355 N.C. at 377, 562 S.E.2d at 393 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord \nNorthampton Cnty. Drainage Dist. No. One v. Bailey, 326 N.C. 742, 746, 392 S.E.2d \n352, 355 (1990). Thus, if a statute interferes with the exercise of a fundamental \nright, strict scrutiny applies even if the affected group is not a suspect class.  \nStephenson, 355 N.C. at 379, 562 S.E.2d at 394; Northampton County, 326 N.C. at \n747, 392 S.E.2d at 356. \n14.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 both interferes with the exercise of the fundamental \nright of voting and operates to disadvantage a suspect class. Therefore, it is subject \nto strict scrutiny.  \n \n58 \n\nII.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s Denial of the Franchise to Individuals on Probation, \nParole, or Post-Release Supervision Violates the North Carolina \nConstitution’s Free Elections Clause \nA.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 Prevents Elections from Ascertaining the Will of \nthe People \n15.  The Free Elections Clause of the North Carolina Constitution declares \nthat “[a]ll elections shall be free.”  N.C. Const., art. I, § 10. It mandates that \nelections in North Carolina faithfully ascertain the will of the people. This clause \nhas no federal counterpart. \n16.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on community \nsupervision violates the Free Elections Clause by preventing elections that \nascertain the will of the people. \n17.  North Carolina’s elections do not faithfully ascertain the will of the \npeople when such an enormous number of people living in communities across the \nState—over 56,000 individuals—are prohibited from voting. \n18.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to persons on community \nsupervision strikes at the core of the Free Elections Clause, moreover, because of its \ngrossly disproportionate effect on African American people. Elections cannot \nfaithfully ascertain the will of all of the people when the class of persons denied the \nfranchise due to felony supervision is disproportionately African Americans by wide \nmargins at both the statewide and county levels.   \n19.  Nor do North Carolina elections faithfully ascertain the will of the \npeople when the vote margin in both statewide and local elections is regularly less \nthan the number of people disenfranchised in the relevant geographic area. \n59 \n\nElections do not ascertain the will of the people when the denial of the franchise to \nsuch a large number of people has the clear potential to affect the outcome of \nnumerous close elections. \n20.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 prevents thousands of people living in North Carolina \ncommunities who would otherwise vote from casting ballots, potentially preventing \nthe will of the people from prevailing in elections that affect every aspect of daily \nlife.  \nB.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s Interference with Free Elections Triggers \nStrict Scrutiny \n21.  Because the right to free elections is a fundamental requirement of the \nNorth Carolina Constitution, Harper, 2022-NCSC-17, P139, N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s \nabridgment of that right triggers strict scrutiny. See Northampton, 326 N.C. at 747, \n392 S.E.2d at 356.  That is so regardless of the General Assembly’s intent in passing \nthe law.  When statutes implicate state constitutional provisions concerning the \nright to vote, “it is the effect of the act, and not the intention of the Legislature, \nwhich renders it void.”  People ex rel. Van Bokkelen v. Canaday, \n73 N.C. 198, 225-26 (1875).  The effect of section 13-1 is to deny the franchise to \nover 56,000 people, disproportionately African Americans.   \n22.  In any event, strict scrutiny would apply here even if the General \nAssembly’s intent were relevant in evaluating a Free Elections Clause claim. In \nmanipulating the electorate by disenfranchising groups of voters perceived as \nundesirable, N.C.G.S. § 13-1 resembles the very English laws that were the impetus \nfor North Carolina’s original free elections clause. \n60 \n\n23.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to persons on felony supervision \nis therefore subject to strict scrutiny.  \n \nIII.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s Denial of the Franchise to Persons on Community \nSupervision Cannot Satisfy Strict or Any Scrutiny \n24.  For the reasons set forth above, section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to \npersons on community supervision is subject to strict scrutiny under both the Equal \nProtection Clause and the Free Elections Clause. To satisfy strict scrutiny, \nDefendants must establish that this provision furthers a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly tailored to do so. Northampton Cnty., 326 N.C. at 747; DOT \nv. Rowe, 353 N.C. 671, 675, 549 S.E.2d 203, 207 (2001). Defendants failed to make \nsuch a showing on all claims.  \n25.  At a minimum, section 13-1’s denial of the franchise is subject to \nintermediate scrutiny. The Supreme Court has consistently applied intermediate \nscrutiny where the government’s discretion to regulate in a particular field had to \nbe balanced against other constitutional protections. Under intermediate scrutiny, \nthe government must show that the challenged law “advance[s] important \ngovernment interests” and is not more restrictive “than necessary to further those \ninterests.” Id. Defendants have failed to establish that section 13-1’s denial of the \nfranchise to people on felony supervision advances any “important” government \ninterest, much less in an appropriately tailored manner. \n26.  Furthermore, because N.C.G.S. § 13-1 does not withstand an \nintermediate level of scrutiny, it fails strict scrutiny as well. See M.E. v. T.J., 275 \n61 \n\nN.C. App. 528, 559, 854 S.E.2d 74, 101 (2020) (articulating intermediate scrutiny as \na less restrictive standard than strict scrutiny).  \n27.  Under any level of scrutiny, Defendants must show that the challenged \nlaw adequately serves sufficient state interests today, not just that the law served \nsome state interest in the past. A “classification must substantially serve an \nimportant governmental interest today, for . . . new insights and societal \nunderstandings can reveal unjustified inequality that once passed unnoticed and \nunchallenged.” Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1690 (2017) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (emphasis original)).  Defendants failed to do so. \n28.  Section 13-1’s denial of the franchise to people on felony supervision \ndoes not advance any valid state interest. Further, much of the evidence presented \ndemonstrates that section 13-1 causes grave harm and undermines important state \ninterests such as voter participation.  \n29.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s denial of the franchise to persons on community \nsupervision violates North Carolina’s Equal Protection Clause, Article I, § 19, and \nthe Free Elections Clause, N.C. Const., art. I, § 10 and does not satisfy strict \nscrutiny. \n \n \n \n \n \n62 \n\nIV.  The Constitutional Provision Regarding Felony Disenfranchisement \nDoes Not Insulate N.C.G.S. § 13-1 From Constitutional Challenge  \n \n30.  Defendants argue that Article VI, § 2, cl. 3 of the North Carolina \nConstitution precludes Plaintiffs from challenging the manner of rights restoration \nset forth in N.C.G.S. § 13-1. That is incorrect.   \n31.  The Court rejected this argument from Defendants in its preliminary \ninjunction order in September 2020 and rejects it again today.  \n32.  Article VI, § 2, cl. 3 reflects a delegation of authority to the General \nAssembly to “prescribe[] by law” the contours of the restoration of the franchise, and \nlegislation enacted by the General Assembly pursuant to this delegation must \ncomport with all other provisions of the North Carolina Constitution.  Because “all \nconstitutional provisions must be read in pari materia,” a constitutional provision \n“cannot be applied in isolation or in a manner that fails to comport with other \nrequirements of the State Constitution.” Stephenson, 355 N.C. at 377-78, 562 S.E.2d \nat 392, 394.   \n33.  The Court recognizes that Article VI, § 2(3) of our Constitution grants \nthe General Assembly the authority to restore citizen rights to persons convicted of \nfelonies. As discussed above, however, Article I, § 19 of our Constitution forbids the \nGeneral Assembly from interfering with the right to vote on equal terms, and \nArticle I, § 10 requires that elections be free so as to ascertain the will of the people. \nAccordingly, when the General Assembly prescribes by law the manner in which a \nconvicted felon’s right to vote is restored, it must do so on equal terms and in a \nmanner that ensures elections ascertain the will of the people. \n63 \n\n34.  “A court should look to the history” in interpreting a constitutional \nprovision, N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, 255 N.C. App. 514, 529, 805 S.E.2d 518, \n527 (2017), aff’d, 371 N.C. 149, 814 S.E.2d 54 (2018), and throughout its history \nArticle VI, § 2, cl. 3 has always been accompanied by implementing legislation.  As \nexplained above, the General Assembly enacted a statutory scheme providing for \nfelony disenfranchisement and rights restoration in 1877, in the very first \nlegislative session after ratification of the 1876 constitutional amendment.  At no \npoint in the 144 years since its adoption has Article VI, § 2, cl. 3 ever operated by its \nown force without implementing legislation. \n35.  In any event, implementing legislation has been enacted, and any \nstatute enacted by the General Assembly must comport with all provisions of the \nNorth Carolina Constitution. As concluded above, section 13-1 fails, beyond all \nreasonable doubt, to do so. \nIt is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED THAT: \n1.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1’s denial of the franchise to persons on felony probation, \nparole, or post-release supervision violates the North Carolina \nConstitution’s Equal Protection Clause and Free Elections Clause.  \n2.  Defendants, their agents, contractors, servants, employees, and \nattorneys, and any persons in active concert or participation with \nthem, are hereby enjoined from preventing any person convicted of a \nfelony from registering to vote or voting due to probation, parole, or \npost-release supervision.   \n64 \n\n3. For the avoidanceofdoubt, under this injunction,if a person otherwise\neligible to vote is notinjail or prison for a felonyconviction, they may\nlawfully rogister and vote in North Carolina.\nin\nSO ORDERED, this thd2 day of MON po9p.\nClff u\nLisa C. Bell, Superior CourtJudge\na Yre5efa8L/E2 zE\nKeith O. Gregory, Superior CourtJudge\nv\nas @ majorityofthis ThreeJudgePanel\n65\n\n \nDISSENT \nJudge Dunlow dissents from the majority’s decision and order. \n  For the reasons specified in my dissent to the majority’s Order on Summary \nJudgment, I dissent from the final order of the majority issued today.   \nThis Court would make the following: \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1.  Article VI, Section 2, Part 3 of the North Carolina Constitution provides: \n \nDisqualification of felon.  No person adjudged guilty of a felony against \nthis State or the United States, or adjudged guilty of a felony in another \nstate that also would be a felony if it had been committed in this State, \nshall be permitted to vote unless that person shall be first restored to the \nrights of citizenship in the manner prescribed by law. \n2.  The Plaintiffs in this action do not challenge the provisions of Article VI, Section \n2, Part 3 of the North Carolina Constitution. \n3.  Because the provisions of Article VI, Section 2, Part 3 of the North Carolina \nConstitution are not challenged in this litigation, this Court must, in analyzing \nthis facial challenge, begin with the assumption that all convicted felons who have \nnot  had  their  rights  of  citizenship  restored  are  properly  and  lawfully \ndisenfranchised pursuant to Article VI, Section 2, Part 3 of the North Carolina \nConstitution. \n4.  The manner prescribed by law for the restoration to the rights of citizenship is \nfound at N.C.G.S. § 13-1.   \n5.  In the present action, Plaintiffs make a facial challenge to N.C.G.S. § 13-1 (the \nrestoration provision),  requesting  this Court,  “Declare  that  N.C.G.S.  §  13-1’s \ndisenfranchisement  of  individuals  while  on  probation,  parole,  or  suspended \nsentence is facially unconstitutional and invalid . . . .”  \n6.  The particular provision being challenged in this action is N.C.G.S. § 13-1(1) \nwhich provides: \nAny person convicted of a crime, whereby the rights of citizenship are \nforfeited,  shall  have  such  rights  automatically  restored  upon  the \noccurrence of any one of the following conditions: \n66 \n\n(1)  The unconditional discharge of an inmate, of a probationer, or of a \nparolee by the agency of the State having jurisdiction of that person or of \na defendant under a suspended sentence by the court. \n7.  N.C.G.S. § 13-2(a) provides: \nThe  agency,  department,  or  court  having  jurisdiction  over  the  inmate, \nprobationer, parolee or defendant at the time his rights of citizenship are \nrestored under the provisions of N.C.G.S. § 13-1(1) shall immediately issue a \ncertificate  or  order  in  duplicate  evidencing  the  offender’s  unconditional \ndischarge and specifying the restoration of his rights of citizenship. \n8.  There has been no evidence presented that any agency, department or court \nhaving jurisdiction over an inmate, probationer, parolee or defendant at the time \nhis rights of citizenship are restored under the provisions of N.C.G.S. § 13-1(1) has \nfailed to immediately issue a certificate or order in duplicate evidencing the \noffender’s unconditional discharge and specifying the restoration of his rights of \ncitizenship. \n9.  Each and every individual who is disqualified from voting under the provisions of \nArticle VI, Section 2, Part 3 of the North Carolina Constitution is automatically \nrestored the right to vote under the provision of N.C.G.S. § 13-1(1).2 \n10. The  Plaintiffs  have  offered,  and  the  Court  received,  a  myriad  of  testimony, \nstatistical analysis and evidence relating to the impact the provision of Article VI, \nSection 2, Part 3 of the North Carolina Constitution (felon disenfranchisement) \nhas on the African American population. \n11. The Plaintiffs have offered no testimony, statistical analysis or evidence relating \nto the impact, if any, N.C.G.S. § 13-1 has on the African American population or \nany other suspect class. \n12. “[F]elons do not enjoy the same measure of constitutional protections . . . as do \ncitizens who have not been convicted of a felony.” State v. Grady, 372 N.C. 509, \n567, 831 S.E.2d 542, 582 (2019). As a result of their own conduct, felons are subject \nto these reduced constitutional protections, which “society . . . recognize[s] as \nlegitimate.” See id. at 555, 831 S.E.2d at 575.  Our courts have recognized that \nthere is a dividing line, for constitutional rights, between those who have “served \n[their] sentence[s], paid [their] debt[s] to society, and had [their] rights restored,” \nand those who have not. Id. at 534, 831 S.E.2d at 561. \n \n2 The Court will take judicial notice that the only prerequisite for an individual to \nhave their citizenship rights restored automatically is that the individual live long \nenough to complete the term of their sentence, probation, parole and/or post-release \nsupervision. \n67 \n\n13. Establishing a process by which convicted felons can regain their citizenship \nrights, including the right to vote, is a valid and legitimate governmental interest. \n14. Establishing a restoration process that requires convicted felons to complete their \nterms  of  imprisonment,  probation,  parole  or  post-release  supervision  before \nregaining their citizenship rights, including the right to vote, is a valid and \nlegitimate governmental interest. \n15. The Free Elections Clause of the North Carolina Constitution mandates that \nelections in North Carolina faithfully ascertain the will of the people.  The people \nwhose  will  is  to  be  faithfully  ascertained  are  the  persons  who  are  lawfully \npermitted to vote in North Carolina elections.   \n16. Because convicted felons, who have not had their citizenship rights restored, are \nnot lawfully permitted to vote in North Carolina elections, the Free Elections \nClause has no application to those persons. \nBased on the foregoing findings of fact, this Court would make the following: \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1.  The Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter. \n2.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 does not bear more heavily on one race than another. \n3.   N.C.G.S. § 13-1 does not have the intent nor the effect of discriminating against \nAfrican Americans. \n4.  The intent of the legislature in enacting N.C.G.S. § 13-1 was to, “substantially \nrelax the requirements necessary for a convicted felon to have his citizenship \nrestored.”  State v. Currie, 284 N.C. 562, 565, 202 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1974). \n5.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 does not interfere with the exercise of a fundamental right. \n6.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 does not operate to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class. \n7.  Because N.C.G.S. § 13-1 does not interfere with the exercise of a fundamental \nright nor does it operate to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class, the \nappropriate  level  of review  to apply in this facial  challenge is rational-basis \nreview.  \n8.  N.C.G.S. § 13-1 bears a rational relationship to valid and legitimate governmental \ninterests. \n9.  The Plaintiffs have failed to meet their heavy burden of showing that N.C.G.S. § \n13-1 bears no rational relationship to any legitimate government interest.  \n68 \n\n \n(cid:49)(cid:48)(cid:46)(cid:78)(cid:46)(cid:67)(cid:46)(cid:71)(cid:46)(cid:83)(cid:46)(cid:32)(cid:167)(cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:45)(cid:49)(cid:32)(cid:100)(cid:111)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:110)(cid:111)(cid:116)(cid:32)(cid:118)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:69)(cid:113)(cid:117)(cid:97)(cid:108)(cid:32)(cid:80)(cid:114)(cid:111)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:99)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:32)(cid:67)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:117)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:78)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:32)(cid:67)(cid:97)(cid:114)(cid:111)(cid:108)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:97)\n(cid:67)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:116)(cid:117)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:46)\n(cid:49)(cid:49)(cid:46)(cid:78)(cid:46)(cid:67)(cid:46)(cid:71)(cid:46)(cid:83)(cid:46)(cid:32)(cid:167)(cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:45)(cid:49)(cid:32)(cid:100)(cid:111)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:110)(cid:111)(cid:116)(cid:32)(cid:118)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:70)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:69)(cid:108)(cid:101)(cid:99)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:67)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:117)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:78)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:32)(cid:67)(cid:97)(cid:114)(cid:111)(cid:108)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:97)\n(cid:67)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:116)(cid:117)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:46)\n(cid:66)(cid:97)(cid:115)(cid:101)(cid:100)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:102)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:103)(cid:111)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:103)(cid:32)(cid:102)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:103)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32)(cid:102)(cid:97)(cid:99)(cid:116)(cid:32)(cid:97)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:32)(cid:99)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:99)(cid:108)(cid:117)(cid:115)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:119)(cid:44)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:105)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:67)(cid:111)(cid:117)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:32)(cid:119)(cid:111)(cid:117)(cid:108)(cid:100)(cid:58)\n(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:44)(cid:32)(cid:65)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:69)(cid:32)(cid:97)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:32)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:67)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:69)\n(cid:49)(cid:46) (cid:84)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:80)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:102)(cid:102)(cid:115)(cid:8217)(cid:32)(cid:112)(cid:114)(cid:97)(cid:121)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:102)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:32)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:108)(cid:105)(cid:101)(cid:102)(cid:32)(cid:97)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:78)(cid:73)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:44)(cid:32)(cid:97)(cid:110)(cid:100)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:80)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:102)(cid:102)(cid:115)(cid:8217)(cid:32)(cid:99)(cid:111)(cid:109)(cid:112)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:105)(cid:110)(cid:116)(cid:32)(cid:105)(cid:115)\n(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:98)(cid:121)(cid:32)(cid:68)(cid:73)(cid:83)(cid:77)(cid:73)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:46)\n(cid:84)(cid:104)(cid:105)(cid:115)(cid:32)(cid:116)(cid:104)(cid:101)(cid:32)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:32)(cid:100)(cid:97)(cid:121)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:102)(cid:32)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:44)(cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:48)(cid:50)(cid:50)(cid:46)\n(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)(cid:95)\n(cid:74)(cid:111)(cid:104)(cid:110)(cid:32)(cid:77)(cid:46)(cid:32)(cid:68)(cid:117)(cid:110)(cid:108)(cid:111)(cid:119)\n(cid:83)(cid:117)(cid:112)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:32)(cid:67)(cid:111)(cid:117)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:32)(cid:74)(cid:117)(cid:100)(cid:103)(cid:101)\n(cid:55)(cid:48)\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \n  I hereby certify that a copy of the foregoing document was served on the persons indicated \nbelow, pursuant to the Court’s July 15, 2020 Case Management Order, via e-mail transmission, \naddressed as follows: \n   \nDaryl Atkinson  Orlando L.

Plaintiffs also\nsock, in the alternative, injunctive relief. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend Section 13-1ofour\nGeneral Statutes violates Article I, Sections 10, 11, 12, 14, and 19ofour Constitution.\nProceduralHistory\nPlaintiff ld the initial complaint in this matteron November20, 2019, and an\namended complainton December 3, 2019. Defendants filed answers to and motions to\ndismiss the amended complaint inJanuary 2020; the motions todismiss were subsequently\nwithdrawn. On May 11, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a motion forsummary judgment or, in the\nalternative, a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 17, 2020, this action was transferredto a three-judge panelofSuperior\nCourt, Wake County, pursuantto N.C.G.S§. 1-267.1 and N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 42(5)(4). On\nJune 24, 2020, the ChiefJustice of the Supreme Courtof North Carolina, pursuant to\nN.C.G.S.§ 1-267.1, assigned the undersigned three-judge panel to preside over the facial\nconstitutional challenges raised in this litigation.\nOn September 4, 2020, a majorityof the undersigned panel granted in part and\ndenied in part Plaintiffs’ motion forsummary judgment, granted summaryjudgment in\npart to Defendants, and granted a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction was.\ngranted with respect to Plaintiffs claims underArticle I, §§ 11 and 19 for those persons\nconvicted ofa felony and, as a result, made subject topropertyqualifications. Specifically,\nthe preliminary injunction stated:\na. Defendants, their officers, agents, contractors, servants,\nemployees, and attorneys, and any persons in active concert or\nparticipation with them who receive actual notice in any\n‘manner ofthis Orderare hereby enjoined from preventing a\npersonconvictedofa felony from registeringtovote and\nexercising their right to vote ifthat person's only remaining\nbarrierto obtaining an “unconditional discharge,” other than\nregularconditionsofprobation pursuant to N.C.C.S. § 15A-\n13430), is the payment ofamonetary amount.\nb. Defendants, their officers, agents, contractors, servants,\nemployees, and attorneys, and anypersons in activeconcertor\nparticipation with them who receive actual notice in any\n‘manner ofthis Orderare hereby enjoined from preventinag\npersonconvictedof a felony from registeringtovote and\nexercisingtheir right to voteifthat has beendischarged from\nprobation, but owed a monetary amount upon the termination\noftheir probation or ifany monetary amountowed upon\ndischarge from probations was reduced to a civil lien.\nThe followingthree claims remained fortrial following the preliminary injunction\nand summaryjudgment:\n1. that N.C.G.S. § 13-1 violates the Equal Protection Clauseof\nthe North Carolina Constitution by depriving all persons\nwith felony convictions subjectto probation, parole, orpost-\n2\n\nrelease supervision, who are not incarcerated,ofthe right\nto vote;\n2. that N.C.G.S. § 13-1 violates the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe North Carolina Constitution by depriving the African\nAmerican communityofsubstantially equal voting power;\n5 that NCS.§ 15-1 ites th Fre BectonClase of\nthe North Carolina Constitution.\n‘Trial on theseclaims was held in Wake County before the three-judge panel on\nAugust 16, 2021 throughAugust 19, 2021. On August 19, 2021, the panel issued a\nclarifying ruling from the bench pertainitnog the languageon the forms promulgated by\nthe State Board ofElections regardingvotereligibility in lightofthe September 4, 2020,\npreliminary injunction. In response to this ruling, State Board Defendants filed a Motion\nfor Clarification, citing concernson the administrability ofa requirement thatthey identify\n‘a smallersegmentofthe population ofNorth Carolinians whoseonly barrierto completing\nthe conditions oftheir probation is the paymentofamonetary obligation. A conferencewas\nheld on the matter via WebEx on August 20, 2021 and the panel announced anoral ruling\nviaconference on WebEx on August 23, 2021.\nVoting QualificationsforPersonsConvictedofFelonies\nArticle VI, Section 2ofthe North Carolina Constitution delineates certain\nqualifications, or disqualifications, affectinga person'sability to vote in ourState. Relevant\nto this case is Article VI, Subsection 2(3), which dictates that “[n]o person adjudged guilty of\na felony against this State orthe United States, or adjudged guilty ofa felony in another\nstate thatalso would be a felony ifit had been committed in this State, shall be permitted\nto vote unless that person shall be frst restored to the rights ofcitizenship in the manner\nprescribed by law.” N.C. Const. art. VI, § 2(3).\n3\n\nPlaintiffs action challenges the “manner prescribed by law” in which voting rights\nareautomatically restored topersons convictedoffelonies. The current iteration ofthe\nrestoration ofrights statute reads as follows:\nAny person convictedofa crime, whereby the rightsofcitizenship are\nforfeited, shall have such rights automatically restored upon the\noccurrence ofany oneofthe following conditions:\n(1) Theunconditional dischargeof an inmate,of a probationer,orof\na parolee by the agency of the State having jurisdiction of that\nperson orofa defendant undera suspended sentence by thecourt.\n(2) The unconditional pardonoftheoffender.\n(3) The satisfaction by theoffenderofall conditionsof a conditional\npardon.\n(4) With regard to any person convicted of a crime against the\nUnited States, the unconditional discharge ofsuch person by the\nagency ofthe United States havingjurisdiction ofsuch person, the\nunconditional pardon of such person or the satisfaction by such\npersonof a conditional pardon.\n(5) With regardtoany person convictedofa crime in anotherstate,\nthe unconditional discharge of such person by the agency of that\nstate having jurisdictionof such person, the unconditional pardon\nof such person or the satisfaction by such person of a conditional\npardon.\nN.C.G:S. § 13-1. That the present-day version ofthestatute requires the unconditional\ndischarge ofaperson convictedof a felony isofparticular import in this case when\nconsidering 1) the history ofhow our State has provided for the restoration ofrights of\ncitizenship, and 2) what is required ofa person convicted ofa felony to ultimately obtain an\nunconditional discharge.\nHistory of Restors itizenship inNorth\nThe manner prescribed by law to restore the rightsofcitizenship forcertain persons\nhas a long and relevant history. In 1835, North Carolina amended itsconstitution to permit\nthe enactmentofgeneral laws regulating the methods by which rightsofcitizenship—\nincludingthe right to vote—are restored topersonsconvictedof“infamouscrimes.”\nInfamouscrimes included offenses which warranted “infamous punishments.”Thereafter in\n4\n\n1840,a general law was passed regulatingthe restoration ofrights, including granting the\ncourts unfettered discretion in restoring rightsofcitizenship.\nAfterthe civil war, North Carolina adopted a new constitution which allowed all\nmen to vote, eliminated property-based voting limitations, and abolished slavery. Persons.\nconvictedofspecificcrimes were notexpressly forbidden by the constitution from voting;\nhowever, acombinationofconstitutional amendments—includingan amendment in 1875\nthat provided for the disenfranchiosfepemresonnts convictedoffelonies and infamous\ncrimes—and laws passed over the followingdecades maintained limitations on the\nrestoration ofrights forpersons convictedofcertaincrimes, thereby continuing todeny\nsuch persons the ability tovote. Judicial discretion remained partofthe process for\nrestoring a person's rightsofcitizenship.\nThese limitations lasted until 1971, when the reference to infamous crimeswas\nremoved from the constitutional provisionand voting rights were taken awayfrom only\npersonsconvictedoffelonies. Later, thestatute was further amended to remove certain,\nexpress requirements that must be metby a person convictedof a felony to have their\nrightsof citizenship restored.\nToday, the restoration ofrights under N.C.G.S. § 13-1 is automatic upon a person's\n“unconditional discharge” and is not expressly subjectto a discretionary decision by a\ngovernment official, e.g, ajudge. But while the final decision to restore a person's rightsof\ncitizenship is not left to the discretionof ajudge, there do remain a numberofdiscretionary\ndecisions, especially in sentencing, but also in whethertocharge an individual, what\noffenses to charge, whetherto reduce charges, and whether a plea offerisextended, that\nhave a direct effect upon when a person's right to vote is restored, along with the\nqualifications and requirements that must ultimately be satisfied before a person convicted\nofa felony is permitted to vote.\n5\n\nInjunctiveRelief\n“The purposeofa preliminary injunction is ordinarily to preserve thestatus\nquopending trialon the merits. Its issuance is a matterofdiscretiontobe exercised by the\nhearingjudge aftera careful balancingoftheequities.” Stateexrel. Edmisten v. Fayetteville\nStreet Christian School, 299 N.C. 351, 357, 261 S..2d 908, 913 (1980). A preliminary\ninjunction is an “extraordinaryremedy”and will issue“only (1) ifa plaintiifsf able to\n‘show likelihoodofsuccess on the meritsofhis case and (2) ifa plaintiifsf likely tosustain\nirreparable loss unless the injunction is issued, or if in theopinion ofthe Court, issuance is\nnecessary forthe protectionof a plaintiffs rights during thecourseof litigation.”A.E.P.\nIndustries, Inc. v. McClure, 308 N.C. 393, 401, 302 S.E.2d T54, 750-60 (1983) (emphasis in\noriginal);seealso N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 65(5). When assessing the preliminary injunction\nfactors, the trialjudge “should engage in a balancingprocess, weighingpotential harm to\nthe plaintififfthe injunction is not issued against the potential harm to the defendant if\ninjunctivereliefis granted. Ineffect, the harm alleged by the plaintiffmustsatisfy a\nstandard ofrelative substantiality as wellas irreparability.” Williams v. Greene, 36 N.C.\nApp. 80, 86, 243 S.E.2d 156, 160 (1978).\nArticle VI, § 2(3), ofour Constitution takes away the right to vote from persons.\nconvicted offelonies but does notcommand the manner in which the right to vote is\nrestored, leaving it only to be in“the mannerprescribed by law.” Hence, it is the\nimplementing legislation thatdetermineswhether a person convictedofa felony has met\nthe requisite qualificationstoexercise the fundamental righttovote.Plaintiffs in this case\nchallenge the facial constitutionality ofthat implementing legislation, contendingN.C.G.S.\n§ 13-1 violates rights guaranteed by multiple provisionsofthe DeclarationofRights in\nArticle I ofour Constitution.\n6\n\nPlaintiffs’ burden toshow a likelihood ofsuccess on the meritsoftheirclaims is\nsubstantial because when aplaintiffchallenges the facial constitutionalityofa statute, the\ncourts presume “that any actpassed by the legislature is constitutional,” and “will not\nstrike itdown if[it] can be upheld on any reasonable ground.” State v. Bryant, 359 N.C.\n554, 564, 614 S.5.2d 479, 486 (2005) (quoting State v. Thompson, 349 N.C. 183, 491, 508.\nS124 277, 281-82 (1998); Cooper v. Berger, 370 N.C. 392, 413, 809 S.E.2d 98, 111 (2018)\n(explaining that courts will not declare a law invalid unless it is determined to be\n“unconstitutional beyond a reasonabledoubt’). Accordingly, “fa]n individual challenging the\nficialconstitutionality ofa legislative act‘must establish that nosetofcircumstances exists\nunder which the [alet would be valid.” Thompson, 349 N.C. at491 (second alteration in\noriginal) (quoting United States v. Salermo, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 2100\n1987).\nIn addition to the authoritytograntand deny equitable relief, North Carolina trial\ncourts have the power to shape thatreliefas a matterofdiscretion. Roberts v. Madison\nCountyRealtorsAss'n, 344 N.C. 394, 399, 474 S524 783, 787 (1996). It is the“unique role\nofthe courts” to be able to “fashion equitable remedies” such as injunctions when it is\nnecessary to“protect and promote theprinciplesofequity.” Lankford v. Wright, 347 N.C.\n115, 120,489S.E.2d 604, 607 (1997).\nExpanding theScopeofthe September4, 2020, Preliminary Injunction to a Wider\nClassofIndividuals\nThe September 4, 2020, preliminary injunction was intended toallow those\nindividuals whoare subject to post-release supervision, parole, orprobation solely byvirtue\nofcontinuing toowe monetaryobligations to register to vote. The languageon State Board\nofElections forms was changed to reflect the preliminary injunction; however, through no\nintentional faultofeither party, this language does not adequately reflectthe intentofthe\n7\n\npreliminary injunction. The panel advised the parties ofthis onAugust 19, 2021, and\nindicated thatan immediate change would need tobe made to the forms toaccurately\nreflect the preliminary injunctions intentand effect.\n‘The panel met with the parties onAugust 20, 2021, upon concerns from State Boaxd\nDefendants and Plaintiffs aboutimplementation and administrability ofthe language as\nproposed by State Board Defendants. After a careful analysisofthe issues presented, the\nCourt has determined that a modificationofthe preliminary injunction to enjoin denial of\nvoter registration for any convicted felon who isoncommunity supervision, whether\nprobation, post release supervision, orparole, is required.\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihoodofsuccess basedon their remainingclaims\nthat stood for trial, in addition to the likelihoodofsuccess on the meritsoftheir claims as\naddressed in this Courts September4, 2020, preliminary injunction. As acknowledged by\nLegislative Defendants at trial, there is nodenying the insidious, discriminatory history\nsurroundingvoterdisenfranchisement andefforts forvoting rights restoration in North\nCarolina. As toa balancingofthe equities, afterweighingthe potential harm to Plaintiffs if\nthe preliminary injunction is not modified to include a broaderclassof individuals against\nthe harm to Defendants ifthe injunction is modified, the Courtconcludes thebalanceof\nequities weighs in Plaintiffs favor.\nAs an initial matter, the State Board Defendants represented to the Court thatthere\nwasan immediate need forclarification and definitive language on State Board ofElection\nforms in light up the upcoming municipal elections. There are several administrability\nchallenges expressed by State Board Defendants that present aseriousthreat ofharm to\nPlaintiffs and theirclients. It is apparentto the Courtthat State Board Defendants may be\nunable toeffectively identify individuals covered by the September 4, 2020, preliminary\ninjunction. State Board Defendants asserted that it may be impossible forthe North\n8\n\nCarolina DepartmentofSafety (DPS) to be able to isolate individualswho areon post-\nrelease supervision, parole, orprobation solely as the result of a monetaryobligation. DPS\n‘has no mechanism foridentifyingwhetherindividuals would not beserving probation but:\nfor those monetary obligations.\nState Board Defendants presented the Court with two proposed avenues to\nimplement the September 4, 2020, preliminary injunction. The firstavenue would place the\nburdenofdisproving ineligibility on voters who may be ligible underthe original\ninjunction language. State Board Defendants admit this may result in preventing\nindividualswho are eligible tovote from voting. Thesecond proposal would involve DPS\nremovingall individuals with monetary obligations as a termoftheir probation from their\nfeedofsupervision,therebyallowing allofthose individuals to registerand vote. However,\nthatcould lead to individuals who are not in fact covered by the September4, 2020,\npreliminary injunction bing erroneously told that they are eligible to vote. This could\nexpose these individuals to criminal liability, as it is a Class I felony in North Carolina foar\nfelon to vote without having had their voting rights restored. See N.C.G.S §163-275. Both of\nthese solutions are untenable.\nFurther, neitherofthe proposals would address the 5,075 federal probationers who\nare notsubject to conditionsof probation under North Carolina la, but are incligible to\nVote due tother felonstatus\n“The harm alleged by Plaintifs is both substantial and irreparable should yet\nanotherelection pass by with Plaintiffs beingprecluded from their fundamental right to\nvote by virtue ofthem being on parole, probation, orpost-release supervision as a resuolfat\nfelonyconviction. In addition, expandingthe scope ofthe Courts priorpreliminary\ninjunction will ease the administrative burden on State Board Defendants.\n9\n\nConclusion\nUnderthesecircumstances, the Court, in its discretion and aftera careful balancing\nofthe equities, concludes tht it is necessary forequity and adminitrability ofthe intent of\nthe September4, 2020, preliminary injunction to amend that injunction toinclude a\nbroaderelassof individuals. The Court furtherconcludes thatthe security already\nsubmitted by Plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 65(c)of the North Carolina RulesofCivil\nProcedure to secure the paymentofcosts and damages in the event it is laterdetermined\nthis reliefhas been improvidentlygranted issufficient and no furthersecurity is needed.\n“The HonorableJohn M.

PROJECT,  THE  LAWYERS’ \nCOMMITTEE  FOR  CIVIL  RIGHTS  UNDER \nTIMOTHY  K.  MOORE,  in his     LAW,  AND  THE  SOUTHERN  POVERTY  LAW \nofficial  capacity as  Speaker of the  CENTER IN  SUPPORT  OF  PLAINTIFFS \nNorth  Carolina  House of \nRepresentatives,  et al., \nDefendants. \n  \nINTRODUCTION'! \nNorth Carolina law  disproportionately  deprives  Black  North  Carolinians  of the right to \nvote  and  prolongs  their disenfranchisement  based  on  circumstances  that  are marked  by  persistent \nracial  inequity  and  have  no  connection to  the  legitimate interests  of the  State.  In extending the \nperiod  of disenfranchisement not  only through  any period  of incarceration,  but  also  through  a \nperson’s  “unconditional  discharge”  from  community supervision  thereafter,” North  Carolina  law \namplifies the hardship that  the  criminal justice system  disproportionately visits upon  Black \nAmericans;  exacerbates  stark  racial  disparities  in  income,  wealth,  and  economic  opportunity;  and \nunduly  mutes  the voices  of Black  North  Carolinians  in  public  affairs. \n  \n'  No  person  or  entity other than amici  curiae,  their members,  or  their  counsel  directly or \nindirectly  wrote  this brief or contributed money for  its preparation. \n2-N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  13-1.\nThe  criminal justice  system  in  North  Carolina,  as  nationwide,  disproportionately  entraps \nBlack  Americans  and  subjects  them to  more  severe  outcomes  at  every stage of the  process.  These \ndisparate  outcomes  go  beyond  what  can  be  accounted  for by  racial  disparities  in  criminal \noffending.  Black  Americans  are more  likely  to  be  stopped  by  police,  searched,  arrested, \nsubjected  to  more  severe  criminal  charges,  incarcerated  pre-trial,  receive  higher bail  amounts, \nand  receive  harsher sentences  than  whites.  Not  surprisingly,  then,  conviction-based  voter \ndisenfranchisement  in North  Carolina disproportionately impacts  Black Americans.  Of the more \nthan  56,000  people  currently barred  from voting because they  are  still  under post-conviction \nsupervision,  42%  are  Black.?  Yet  Blacks  account  for only 22%  of the  state’s  total  population.* \nNorth  Carolina also  extends  the period  of voters’  disenfranchisement  based  on \ncircumstances  that  consistently  disadvantage  Black  Americans.  Some of these  circumstances— \nsuch  as the  severity of criminal  charges  prosecutors  choose,  and  sentence  length—are driven  by \ndiscretionary  decisions  of criminal justice  authorities  that consistently demonstrate a  racially \ndiscriminatory  impact,  subjecting Black  Americans  to  harsher results than  white  Americans. \nOther circumstances  that  prolong disenfranchisement,  such  as one’s  ability to  pay down  fines \nand  fees or to  find  work  after imprisonment,  are based not on  criminal justice outcomes  but on \naccess  to  income  and  wealth.  Here, too,  stark  racial  disparities radically disadvantage Black \nAmericans.  In North  Carolina,  the poverty  and unemployment  rates  for Black  Americans are \nmore than double those for  white Americans,  and  the average wealth  of white households  is over \n  \n3  Pl.’s  Mot.  and  Br.  in  Supp.  of Mot.

Ct.,  May  8,  2020)  (citing \nExpert  Report  of Frank  R.  Baumgartner). \n4  Id.;  see  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Quick Facts:  North  Carolina  (July  1,  2019), \nhttps://www.census.gov/quick facts/fact/table/NC.\nseven  times  that  of Black  Americans.°  All  of those  circumstances  impact  one’s  ability  to \nsuccessfully  complete  community  supervision  and  to  timely  obtain the  “unconditional  discharge” \nnecessary  for the reinstatement of voting rights.  The impact  of North  Carolina’s \ndisenfranchisement  law  through  the  completion of community  supervision  is  significant:  of  all \nthe  North  Carolina potential  voters  who  were  disenfranchised  in  2016 because  of a  felony \nconviction,  over  half,  57%,  were  on  community supervision—either on probation or on \nsupervised  release  after having  completed  their  sentenced  term  of incarceration.® \n“The right  to  vote is  the  right to participate  in  the  decision-making process  of \ngovernment,”  and  as  such,  it  is  “at  the  foundation  of a  constitutional  republic.””  Discriminating \nagainst  a  group  of people  by disproportionately depriving them  of the opportunity to  participate \nin republican  governance not  only  contradicts  American  democratic principles,  but has  practical, \nmeasurable  impacts  deleterious  to  the health of the  State  and  the  lives  of Black  North \nCarolinians.  It  mutes  the  voices  of Black  North  Carolinians  in  public  affairs,  which  leads  to  the \ndisproportionate  imposition on  low-income,  minority  communities  of fines-and-fees  ordinances, \nwhich  itself,  hinders  Black  economic  advancement  and  fuels  the  growing wealth  gap  between \nBlack  and  white Americans.  More  broadly,  the muting of Black  political  power  prevents  Black \nNorth  Carolinians  from  employing the political  process  to  make  meaningful  changes  in  the \nsystems  that,  like the criminal justice  system,  so  often  discriminate  against  them.  In  contrast,  the \n  \n>  See  infra  p.16. \n®  See  Christopher  Uggen et  al.,  6 million  lost voters:  State-level estimates  of felony \ndisenfranchisement,  2016,  The  Sentencing  Project  (Oct.  6.  2016), \nhttps://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/6-million-lost-voters-state-level-estimates- \nfelony-disenfranchisement-2016/ (figures  derived  from  Tables  3  and  4). \n’  Texfi  Indus.,  Inc.  v.  City  of Fayetteville,  301  N.C.  1,  13,  269  S.E.2d  142,  150  (1980). \n3\nrestoration  of voting  rights  measurably  correlates  to  increased participation  in  democratic  society \nand  the reduction of recidivism. \nThough  the  North  Carolina Constitution  calls  for the initial  deprivation of voting rights \nupon  conviction  for a  felony,  extending the period  of disenfranchisement  based  on  circumstances \nthat  so  consistently and disproportionately  discriminate against  long-oppressed  and  marginalized \nmembers  of society  serves  only  to  continue that oppression and  marginalization.  Such \ndiscrimination  violates  the North  Carolina Constitution,  whose disenfranchisement provision \nmust  be  read  in  harmony  with  its  provisions  guaranteeing the  equal  protection of the  laws,  free \nelections,  freedom  of speech  and  association,  and  the prohibition  of property  qualifications  to \nvote,  as  Plaintiffs  contend  in their Complaint.*  Given  its  roots  in  State-sanctioned  racial \nsubjugation  and discrimination,  as  illustrated  in the Plaintiffs’  Complaint  and  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment,  the  extension  of disenfranchisement  through  probation  and  supervised \nrelease  is unconstitutional. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Racial  disparities  inherent in  the criminal justice  system contribute to  the \ndisproportionate  disenfranchisement  of Blacks  in  North  Carolina. \nIn  North  Carolina,  as  nationwide,  discriminatory racial  disparities  permeate  each  stage  of \ncontact with  the  criminal justice  system.  These disparate outcomes  go  beyond  what  can  be \naccounted  for  by  racial  disparities  in  criminal  offending.

Policing \nThe  disparate  and  more  negative  impact  of the  criminal justice  system on communities  of \ncolor in  North  Carolina is  evident  even  before  arrest,  in  decisions  about  what  laws  to  enforce, \nhow  to  enforce them,  where  to  enforce  them,  and  whom  they  are  enforced  against.  Drug \nenforcement  practices,  for example,  disproportionately target  Black North  Carolinians,  even \nthough  drug  usage  patterns  do  not differ  substantially  by  race.  In 2018,  Blacks  in  North  Carolina \nwere 3.3  times  as  likely as  whites  to  be arrested  for marijuana possession.'?  That arrest rate \nmirrors  the  rate  for Black  Americans  nationwide,  where Blacks  were  3.6  times  as  likely to  be \narrested  for  marijuana possession  in  2018,  even though  rates of marijuana  usage are similar for \nBlacks  and  whites.'*  Policing  strategies that target  lower-income neighborhoods necessarily \nresult  in  more  police  contacts  with  people of color.  The “War on  Drugs,”  “Broken  Windows” \npolicing,  and  “Stop  and  Frisk,”  for example,  all  entail  higher levels  of police  contact  with  Black \nAmericans,'>  and  increased police  contact means  more  stops,  more  searches,  and  more  arrests. \nB.  Stops  and  Arrests \nAs  of 2018,  Black  North  Carolinians were  being arrested  at  2.3  times  the rate  of whites.'°  \nDifferential  rates  of criminal  offending do  not  account  for this  disparity.

In  their book  Suspect  Citizens,  scholars  Frank Baumgartner,  Derek \nEpp,  and  Kelsey Shoub  analyzed more than  20  million  traffic  stops  in  North  Carolina  from 2002 \nto  2016.'”  They  found  that  Black  drivers  are about  twice as  likely  as  white drivers  to  be  stopped \non the highways.'*  Once  pulled  over,  they  are about  twice as  likely to  be  searched,  even  though \npolice were /ess  likely  to  find  contraband  on  searched Black  drivers  than  on  white drivers.\" \nAnother  study  found  similar racial  disparities  in arrests  for low-level  drug offenses. \nWhen Charlotte-Mecklenburg police encounter someone possessing less  than  half an  ounce of \nmarijuana,  officers  have discretion  either to  make an  arrest or to  issue  a citation.  A  Charlotte \nObserver review  of police records  found  that  in these situations  police  arrested  Blacks  nearly \nthree times  as  often  as  whites.”  Since 2012,  the  review  found,  racial  disparities  in  such  cases \nhave  increased  even while arrests  in  such  cases  overall  have declined.?! \nBecause  North  Carolina  law  disenfranchises  individuals  not only for  in-state  felony \nconvictions, but  for other  state  and  federal  convictions  as  well,  it  is  also  important  to  consider \nnationwide racial  disparities  in  the criminal justice system.

Prosecution  and  Pretrial  Detention \nProsecutors  consistently make discretionary decisions that disproportionately \ndisadvantage people  of color.  In  North  Carolina,  prosecutors’  “peremptory  challenges  are indeed \na  vehicle  for  veiled  racial  bias  that results  in juries  less  sympathetic  to  defendants  of color.”*4  By \ncollecting  statewide jury  selection records,  the Jury  Sunshine  Project  found  that  in 2011, \nprosecutors removed  twice  as  many potential  Black jurors  as  white jurors.2°  White jurors  were \nstatistically  more  likely to  return  convictions,  and  for every  peremptory challenge that  a \nprosecutor used  to  strike  a  potential  Black juror,  the conviction rate  for Black  male defendants \nincreased  by  2-4%.”°  Similarly,  a 2012  study  conducted by  Michigan  State  University  law \nprofessors  Catherine Grosso  and Barbara  O’Brien  showed  that North  Carolina prosecutors  were \nmore than  twice  as  likely  to  strike qualified  Black potential jurors  as  whites  in  death  penalty \nconvictions between  1990  and  2010,  even  after  accounting  for other relevant juror characteristics \n(such  as  expressed  reservations  about  the death  penalty,  economic  hardships,  and  past run-ins \nwith the law).” \n  \n3  Chin, supra  note  9,  at 443. \n4  Ronald  Wright,  Yes,  Jury Selection  Is  as  Racist  as  You  Think.

Rev.  1531,  1554  (2012).\nRacial  discrimination  in  prosecutors’  uses  of peremptory  strikes  in  North  Carolina has \nbeen  proven  in  the  courtroom,  as  well.  In  State  v.  Robinson,  the  court  found  that  “race  was,  in \nfact,  a  significant  factor  in  the  prosecution’s  use  of peremptory strikes.””*  Among  other  evidence, \nthe  court’s  finding  was  based  on  comprehensive  statistical  studies  examining prosecutors’  uses \nof peremptory strikes  in North  Carolina  and  showing that  race  was a  statistically significant \nfactor  in  the  use  of such  strikes,  and  on  expert testimony  concerning  social  psychology  and  the \ninfluence  of race  on  perception, judgment,  decision-making,  and jury  selection.”” \nDecisions  of the North  Carolina  Supreme  Court  issued  in just  the  last  two  months \nillustrate how prosecutions  in North  Carolina  have  been riddled  with  racial  bias.  In State  v. \nRamseur,  the  Court  held  that the  capital  defendant had  produced  sufficient  evidence  under  the \nNorth  Carolina Racial  Justice  Act  (since repealed)  to  warrant  an  evidentiary  hearing on whether \nracial  bias  had  infected the defendant’s  sentence  of death:  the defendant had  sufficiently  forecast \nevidence tending to  show  that,  in  the relevant  geographic  areas,  race  was  a  significant  factor in \nthe prosecution’s  use of peremptory  challenges,  in  the prosecution’s  decision  to proceed \ncapitally,  and  in the  actual  imposition  of death  sentences,  at the  time defendant’s  sentence  was \nimposed.”  In State  v.  Burke,  the  Court  noted  that the capital  defendant  had  presented  evidence \nthat race was  a significant  factor in jury  selection,  sentencing,  and  capital  charging decisions  in \nthe jurisdictions  relevant  to  his  trial  and  sentencing.*!

Prosecutors  are  more  likely  to  charge people of color \nthan  to  charge whites  with  crimes  that  carry  heavier sentences.  A  study examining federal \ncharging decisions  found  a dramatic disparity disfavoring blacks  in  the severity of the charges \nthat  prosecutors  decide to  pursue  and  in  the  likelihood  of facing charges  with  mandatory \nminimum  sentences.*?

High  levels  of  pretrial  detention  and  its  concomitant  racial  disparity  fuel  further \nracial  inequities  in  later stages of the  criminal justice process.  Pretrial  detention  has  been  shown \nto  increase  the odds  of conviction,  and  people  who  are detained  awaiting  trial  are  also  more \nlikely  to  accept  less  favorable plea deals,  to  be  sentenced to  prison,  and  to receive longer \nsentences.” \nD.

A  study  of \nover  77,000  federal  sentences  found  that  Black  defendants  receive  substantially longer  sentences, \neven  after  controlling  for extensive  criminological,  demographic,  and  socioeconomic  variables; \nthat  Black defendants  are  less  likely to  receive  a  non-prison term  when  that  option  is  available; \nless  likely  to  receive downward  departures;  more  likely to  receive  upward  adjustments;  and \nwhen  they  do  receive  downward  departures,  receive  smaller reductions  than white defendants. \nA  study of sentences  in  Georgia  between  1995  and  2002  showed  that  criminal  sentences  of \nBlacks  were 4.25%  longer than  those of whites,  even  when  controlling  for other  relevant  factors, \nand that disparity in sentences  even extended to  skin color,  with Blacks  who  have “medium”  and \n“dark”  complexions receiving  sentences  4.8%  longer than those  for whites  and  “light \ncomplected”  Blacks.” \nE.  Impact on  Disenfranchisement \nThe racial  disparities  in  policing,  stops,  arrests,  charges, jury selection,  access  to  counsel, \npretrial  detainment,  sentencing  and  imprisonment necessarily  contribute  to  the  discriminatory \ndisenfranchisement of Blacks under North  Carolina’s  system  of felony  disenfranchisement.  The \ndisproportionate impacts  on  Blacks  at  every  stage  of the  criminal justice  system  also \ndisproportionately  denies  them  the  right  to  vote.

Racial  disparities  in  income,  wealth,  and  economic  opportunity impose  higher \nbarriers  to  re-enfranchisement for  Blacks. \nBlack  Americans  on  community supervision  face greater challenges  to  successfully \nreentering  society  and  satisfying the  conditions  of that  supervision,  which  can prolong  the period \nof disenfranchisement.  The  collateral  consequences  ofa  criminal  conviction—-consequences \nlimiting  employment  opportunities,  access  to  stable  housing,  skilled  trade or professional \nlicensing,  and  eligibility  for social  services—all  fall  more  heavily on  Blacks,  as  discussed  below. \nThese collateral  consequences  make  it  more  difficult  to  satisfy  common  requirements of \ncommunity  supervision,  such  as  the requirement  to  pay down  court  fines  and  fees,  and  to meet \nconditions  such  as  finding  stable  employment that,  as  explained  below,  would  reduce  the  period \nof supervision. \nPeople with  criminal  records  face a  host of obstacles  in reentering society.  These include \nbarriers  to  securing  steady  employment  and  housing,  to  accessing  the  social  safety net  and \nfederal  student  aid,  and  to  exercising the right  to  vote.  “Poor people,  people of color,  and  men \nare more  likely  to  be  involved  in  the  criminal justice  system  and  therefore  to  incur these direct \nand  collateral  costs  [of criminal  convictions].”\"  People of color—particularly  Black  men— a re \nmost  exposed to  the  collateral  consequences  associated  with a criminal  record.

In  North  Carolina,  the percentage  of Black  adults  with  felony convictions was more \nthan  double the percentage  for all  adults---14%  of Black  adults  had  criminal  convictions \ncompared  to  only 6%  for  all  adults.*° \nNearly  one-third  of U.S.  workers  hold jobs  that require  an  occupational  license,  a \nrequirement  which  sometimes  bars  and  often poses  cumbersome  obstacles  for people with \ncriminal  records.™  In  sectors  that  do  not  require  licensing,  scholar  Devah  Pager’s  Milwaukee \nstudy  found employers  were  50%  less  likely to  call  back  white job  applicants with  incarceration \nhistories  than comparable  applicants  without  prison records.*  Black job  applicants,  who  are  less \nlikely to receive  callbacks  than  white  applicants  to  begin  with,  experience an  even  more \npronounced  discrimination related  to  a  criminal  record.  As  Pager’s  research has  revealed,  whites \nwith  criminal  records  received  more  favorable  treatment than  Blacks  without  criminal  records.° \nIn  addition  to  these collateral  consequences,  the  persistent  gap  in  economic power \nbetween whites  and Black  Americans  imposes  still  greater difficulties  on  the  ability of Black \nAmericans  to  pay the  monetary  costs  associated with their convictions,  which  is  a  common \nrequirement of post-conviction  supervision.

The \nUniversity of North  Carolina’s  Center on Poverty,  Work,  and  Opportunity’s  analysis  of surveys \nconducted  between  2004  and  2006  in the  state  found  that  the median value  of total  wealth held \nby  white households  ($71,900)  was  over seven  times the wealth  of Black  households  ($9,500). \nThe  Center concluded  that “among the 33  states  for which  there are data  available,  North \nCarolina  has  the  seventh  largest  wealth  gap  between  white  and  non-white  households  and  the \nninth  largest  asset  poverty  rate.”  These  findings  suggest  that  even  when  Black  and  white \nindividuals  have  similar  levels  of legal  debt,  they  have vastly different levels  of income  and \nwealth  to  pay  it.  As  Abby  Shafroth  explains  in  her examination  of Criminal Justice Debt  in  the \nSouth,  the racial  wealth gap  compounds  the disproportionate imposition  of fines  and  fees: \n“Because black  families  have less  wealth  to  draw  upon  than  white  families  when hit  with \nunexpected  fines  or  fees,  black  families  are  more  likely to  be  unable  to  pay  the  amounts  assessed \n  \n63  See  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Am.

Whereas  a  white  family just  above the poverty \nline  may  have  about  $18,000  in  wealth,  a similarly  situated  Black  family  has  closer to  zero \ndollars  in wealth,  or even  negative wealth.”  “This  lack  of assets plays  a  tangible role in  not  only \nthe  advancement  of Black people  financially,  but  in  how Black  people might  fare  when \nconfronted  with  a  crisis  or emergency.””  One  study  in  the American Journal of Sociology \nillustrates  the impact of this  wealth  gap  in  the  context of individuals  on  post-conviction \nsupervision.  Examining average legal  debt in Washington  State in relation  to  estimated  annual \nearnings,  the  study found  that  formerly  incarcerated  white  men  had,  by 2008,  been assessed \nmonetary  sanctions roughly  equivalent to  their expected  annual  earnings.

North  Carolina \nlaw  explicitly lists  the  payment of court  costs,  costs  for appointed  counsel,  restitution,  and  other \nconviction-related  financial  obligations  as  “[a]ppropriate  controlling conditions,  violation  of \nwhich may result  in revocation  of post-release  supervision.”””  Nonpayment  can result in \nrevocation of supervision,  re-imprisonment,  and  the  extension  of one’s  period  of supervised \nrelease  during the period  of re-imprisonment,  thereby  lengthening the  period  of \ndisenfranchisement  for those on parole.  For probationers,  courts  in  North  Carolina  can  extend  the \nperiod  of probation,  and therefore the  period  of voter disenfranchisement,  for nonpayment  of \ncourt  fines  and  fees.” \nFurthermore,  the  inequitable challenges  Blacks  face  finding employment make them  far \nless  likely to  qualify for earned  time  credits  that  would  reduce the period  of their supervision  and \nallow them  to  earn  back  their  voting rights  as  quickly  as those,  like  whites,  with  far better \nemployment opportunities.  North  Carolina law  allows  supervisees  to  receive “earned time  credit” \nfor working “faithfully at  suitable  employment,”  and  this  earned  time  credit  may reduce the \nsupervisce’s  period  of post-release  supervision.”  Black  supervisces,  who  face  far higher hurdles \nin  finding  employment than  white  supervisees,  have  far  less  access  to  such  good  time  credit,  and \nwill  remain  longer on  supervision,  without  the  opportunity to  restore their  voting rights,  simply \nbecause of this  institutionalized  economic inequity. \n  \n2  N.C.

As  Professor  Beth  Colgan  explained  in  the  Duke  Law Journal,  a study of traffic \nticketing in  North  Carolina revealed  that municipal  reliance on revenue from  traffic  ticketing \ncould be reduced with  even marginal  increases  in  a  community’s political  participation.” That  is, \nwhere  elected  officials  could be  held  politically  accountable  for overly  aggressive traffic \nticketing,  they  were  reticent  to  engage in  revenue-generating practices  in  those communities.”  It \nis  not  surprising then,  as  the  United  States  Commission  on  Civil  Rights  reported  in  2017,  that \nmunicipalities tend to  “target”  their  communities  of color for the  imposition  of fines  and  fees to \nincrease  municipal  revenues.”  “Targeting means  these municipalities  exploit their poorest \ncitizens  by,  among other  means,  using law  enforcement  as  ticketing  and  collections  agencies  to \nincrease municipal  revenues  as  distinct  from  focusing on public  safety  and  civil  compliance.” \n  \n7 Beth  A.

The  key to the door out of this  cycle  is  the key that \nNorth  Carolina’s  law  withholds:  the right  to  vote.  Voting,  the  Constitution recognizes,  is  the \nprincipal  means  for citizens  to  seek  “redress  of grievances.”*®  If that  right  to  vote  were  restored \nsooner,  upon  release  from  incarceration,  Black  communities  could  gain  the  clout  to  elect \nrepresentatives  of their choice  who  would be responsive to  their communities’  needs,  including \nin areas  such  as reducing  the  obstacles  to  their  exercising their  right  to  vote  and  closing  the  racial \nwealth  gap.  As  University  of North  Carolina Professor Frank  Baumgartner  noted  in  his  Expert \nReport  submitted  in  support of the  Plaintiffs’  motion  for summary judgment,  there were  16 \ncounty-level  elections  in  2018  where  the  margin  of victory was  less  than  the  number of \nindividuals  in that county who  are  currently  disenfranchised because they  are on  supervised \nrelease;  the 2016  gubernatorial  election  was  decided  by  a margin  of 10,263,  well  below  the more \nthan  56,000 individuals  disenfranchised because  they  are on  supervised  release.*! \n  \n80 N.C.

Moore, \net al.,  No.  19-cv-15941,  at  5  (N.C.  Super.  Ct.  May  8,  2020). \n21\nDue  to  the  racial  disparities  inherent  in  the criminal justice  system  and  in  the economic \nposition  of Black  Americans,  they are  more  likely  to  be disenfranchised,  and  disenfranchised  for \nlonger,  by  North  Carolina’s  disenfranchisement  system.  And  because that  system  contributes  to \nthe  suppression  of Black  economic  advancement  and  deprives  Blacks  of the political  voice \nnecessary to  correct  the  inequities  that perpetuate  their economic  disadvantage,  North Carolina’s \nsystem  of disenfranchisement  serves  only to  continue the  subjugation  of Blacks  in North \nCarolina.  It must therefore be  declared  unconstitutional. \nTW.  Re-enfranchisement  Reforms \nMindful  of the  racial  disparities  inherent  in  felony disenfranchisement  schemes  and  of the \ninequity  such  systems  perpetuate,  there  has  been  a  wave of reform  to  felony  disenfranchisement \nlaws  in  the United  States  since  1997.  Over the  last  two  decades,  25  states  have enacted  a range  of \nreforms,  variously either eliminating categories  of disenfranchisement  or adopting practices  to \nease  the rights-restoration  process.*”  Specifically regarding the  issues  in  this  case,  cight states \nhave  expanded  the  ability  of persons  on  probation  and/or parole  supervision  to  vote — Colorado, \nConnecticut,  Louisiana,  Maryland,  Nevada,  New  Jersey, New  York,  and Rhode  Island.  As  a \nresult,  20  states  now  allow  all  citizens  who  are not  incarcerated  to  vote.*? \nThese reforms reflect  a recognition  that  access  to  the ballot  box  can  improve the \nlikelihood of successful reentry  and  decrease  recidivism.  While  successful reentry  is  largely \nconditioned upon  access  to  employment,  housing,  and  other  services,*  a  key  additional \n  \n®?

In  this  regard,  participation  in  the  electoral  process  is  clearly a \nstrong means of connecting with  the larger  community and  affirming one’s  commitment to that \nlarger community. \nInvolvement in  the  electoral  process  appears  to  produce positive public  safety  benefits  for \nthe  community  as  well.  An  assessment of this  issue  by Christopher Uggen  and  Jeff Manza  finds \nthat  among people  with prior arrests,  there  are “consistent  differences  between  voters  and  non- \nvoters  in rates  of subsequent arrest,  incarceration,  and  self-reported  criminal  behavior,”**  and \nthat  “[vJoting appears  to  be  part of a package  of pro-social  behavior that  is  linked  to  desistance \nfrom  crime.”®’  Disenfranchisement,  in  contrast,  can  be viewed  as  one element of the  growing \nscope of the  collateral  consequences  of a criminal  conviction  that  make  it  increasingly difficult \nfor persons  coming out  of prison  to  rejoin  the  community  in  a  productive  manner. \nCompared  to  other  nations,  felony  disenfranchisement policy in  the United  States  is  far \nmore extreme.  Not only  does  the United  States  lead  the world  in  its  rate  of incarceration,  but  it \nalso  maintains  far greater restrictions  on  voting  rights  than  in  any other democratic  nation.

The only \nexceptions  to  this  are relatively trivial  or  very  limited  ones,  such  as the German provision  of \npermitting a  maximum  five-year post-sentence  loss  of voting rights  for offenses  connected  to \nvoting fraud  or misuse of the  ballot  box.®?  In  2003,  only two  persons  in  Germany were \ndisenfranchised under these  provisions.”  In  addition,  Belgium  grants judicial  discretion  to \ndisenfranchise certain  convicted  individuals  if this  decision  does  not deprive  them \ndisproportionately ofa  fundamental  right.?! \nThe gap  between  U.S.  policies  and those of other nations can  be seen  through \nConstitutional  Court  decisions  in  several  nations  which  have prohibited  felony \ndisenfranchisement  across  the board.  While  these  decisions  go  beyond  the  issues  in  the current \ncase,  they are illustrative in  documenting the  extreme nature of policies  such  as those in  North \nCarolina  that  disenfranchise  individuals  living  under community  supervision. \n  \n88  See  Laleh  Ispahani,  Voting Rights  and Human  Rights:  A  Comparative  Analysis  of Criminal \nDisenfranchisement  Laws  in  Criminal  Disenfranchisement  in  an  International  Perspective 26 \n(Alec C.

Given  the  racial  disparities  that \nNorth Carolina’s  disenfranchisement  law  compounds-—the  broader sweep  of the  criminal justice \nsystem  among Blacks,  the  more  severe  and  negative outcomes  they  experience  at  every  stage, \n  \n2  Sauvé  v.

It  is time  for the  elimination  of such  racially \nbiased obstacles  to  democratic  participation  in North  Carolina,  and  for the  State’s \ndisenfranchisement  law to be declared  unconstitutional. \nThis  the  24th  day  of July  2020. \nLawyerMs’ KCom mitAtee  forS  Civil  R ights  Under Law \nMark Dotosin  ev  Cw \nNC  State  Bar  No.  20935 \nmdorosin@lawyerscommittee.org \nElizabeth  Haddix \nNC  State  Bar  No.  25818 \nehaddix@  lawyerscommittee.org \nP.O.

BLACK,  IN \nHIS  OFFICIAL  CAPACITY  AS  MEMBER \nOF  THE NORTH  CAROLINA  STATE \nBOARD  OF  ELECTIONS, \nDefendants. \n  \nPlaintiffs,  complaining  of Defendants,  say  and  allege: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The  North  Carolina  Constitution  guarantees  free  and  fair  elections,  in which  all \ncitizens  have  an  equal  voice  in  choosing  their  elected  representatives.  The  right to  vote  is  a \nfundamental  right  in this  state,  and  like  all  fundamental  rights,  it  may  not  be  abridged  absent  a \ncompelling  government  interest.  Yet,  with  no  legitimate  government  interest  whatsoever,  state \nlaw denies  the  right to  vote to  tens  of thousands  of people  living  in North  Carolina  communities, \nbecause  they  have  a prior  felony  conviction.  These  individuals  are  prohibited  from  voting  until \nthey  are  “unconditionally  discharged”  from probation,  parole,  or  a  suspended  sentence—often \nyears  after  their  release  from  incarceration  and  reentry  into  society.  In many  cases,  the \ndisenfranchisement persists  solely  because  of a person’s  inability  to  pay  court  fees.  In  some \ninstances,  North  Carolinians  convicted  of felonies  are  placed  under  community  supervision \nsentences  by  the  court without  incarceration;  while  they  are  economically  contributing to  society, \nNorth  Carolina law bars  them  from  voting  for the  entirety  of their probationary  period.  These \nNorth  Carolinians  are  neighbors,  co-workers,  family  members,  taxpayers,  and participants  in \ncivic  groups.  The  same  as  all  other  citizens,  their  lives  are  governed by  the  laws  enacted  and \nenforced  by  elected  officials.  But  unlike  their neighbors,  they  are  denied  the  fundamental  right \nto  participate  in choosing their representatives.  This  felony-based  disenfranchisement  scheme  of \nNorth  Carolinians  living  in  our  community  (“probation  and  post-release  felony \ndisenfranchisement’”)  serves  no  legitimate  government  purpose.  It  is  unfair,  discriminatory,  and \nwrong.  And  it violates  the North  Carolina  Constitution. \n2.  The  impact  of this  disenfranchisement  scheme  is  staggering.  According  to  a \nrecent  estimate,  roughly  70,000  North  Carolinians  are  unable  to  vote  today  because  of a felony\nconviction,  even  though  they  have  been released  from  incarceration  (or  were  never  incarcerated) \nand  are  living  in  communities  across  the  state.  And  by  wide  margins,  this  scheme \noverwhelmingly  harms  African Americans,  who  represent  about  20%  of North  Carolina’s  voting \npopulation  but  40%  of those  disenfranchised  while  on probation,  parole,  or  a  suspended \nsentence.  The  impact  on  African-American  men  is  even  more  disparate. \n3.  While  the  North  Carolina  Constitution provides  that the  “manner”  of rights \nrestoration  shall  be  “prescribed  by  law,” N.C.  Const.,  Art.  VI,  §  2,  cl.  3,  the  General  Assembly  of \ncourse  must  exercise  this  authority  consistent with other  constitutional  limitations. \n4.  One  such  limitation  is  the North  Carolina  Constitution’s  command  that  “all \nelections  shall  be  free”—a provision  specifically  intended  to  prohibit  government manipulation \nof the  electorate.  Probation and  post-release  felony  disenfranchisement  perniciously  restricts  the \nelectorate  eligible  to  vote  in North  Carolina.  The  felony-based  disenfranchisement  law  strikes  at \nthe  heart  of the  Free  Elections  Clause’s  guarantee  that  elections  in North  Carolina must  “freely \nand  honestly  ...  ascertain  .  .  .  the  will  of the  people.”  Common  Cause  v Lewis,  No.  18  CVS \n014001,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *109-12  (N.C.  Super.  Sep.  03,  2019). \n5.  North  Carolina’s Equal  Protection  Clause,  which  affords  broader  protections  than \nits  federal  counterpart,  protects  “the  fundamental right  of each North  Carolinian to  substantially \nequal  voting  power.”  Stephenson  v.  Bartlett,  355  N.C.  354,  379,  562  S.E.2d  377,  394  (N.C. \n2002).  North  Carolina’s  post-release  felony  disenfranchisement  scheme  deprives  all  people \nsubject  to  probation  or  parole  of “substantially  equal  voting  power,”  and  this  scheme \ndiscriminates  against  African  Americans  in  intent and  effect  in particular. \n6.  This  State’s  free  speech  and  assembly  guarantees  likewise  provide  broader \nprotections  than their federal  counterparts,  and  “[vJoting  for  the  candidate  of one’s  choice”  is  a\n“core  means  of political  expression protected  by  the North  Carolina  Constitution’s  Freedom  of \nSpeech  and  Freedom  of Assembly  Clauses.”  Common  Cause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *119.  Post- \nrelease  disenfranchisement  constitutes  an  outright ban  on  such  political  expression. \n7.  Lastly,  the  requirement that  people  pay  money  to  regain  access  to  the  franchise \nviolates  the North  Carolina  Constitution’s  Ban  of Property  Qualifications. \n8.  This  Court  should  declare that North  Carolina’s  probation  and  post-release  felony \ndisenfranchisement  law  violates  the North  Carolina  Constitution,  and  enjoin  Defendants  from \ndenying  the  fundamental  right to  vote  to  people previously  convicted  of a  felony  who  are  living \nin  society. \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff Community  Success  Initiative  (“CST”)  is  a  nonpartisan,  nonprofit \norganization  based  in  Raleigh,  North  Carolina that  works  with people  who  find themselves \nentangled  in  the  criminal justice  system  and  their  families  as  they  transition  back  into  family  and \ncommunity  life.  The  fundamental  mission  of CSI  is  to  create  a  support network for people \nentangled  in  the  criminal justice  system.  To  that  end,  CSI  works to  ensure  that  people  with \nfelony  convictions,  including  those  who  remain  disenfranchised  under N.C.G.S.  §  13-1,  can \nsuccessfully  reintegrate  into  civic  life.  CSI  provides  small  group  trainings  and  individual \nmentoring  in  general  life  skills,  civic  engagement,  leadership,  entrepreneurship,  and  financial \nliteracy.  Through these  training  and mentorship  sessions,  CSI  diverts  time  and  resources  away \nfrom  its  other  work to  educate  people,  including  people  disenfranchised  under N.C.G.S.  §  13-1, \nabout  their  voting  rights  (or  lack thereof),  and  assists  them  in registering  to  vote  (in  accordance \nwith  current North  Carolina law).  CSI  also  convenes  gatherings  where  citizens  with  felony \nconvictions  can  network,  share  experiences,  and  exchange  knowledge  and resources.\n10.  Plaintiff Justice  Served N.C.,  Inc.  is  a nonpartisan,  nonprofit  organization  based  in \nRaleigh,  North  Carolina that  works  with people  who  find themselves  entangled  in  the  criminal \njustice  system.  The  fundamental  mission  of Justice  Served  is  to  ensure  that  these  individuals  are \nable  to  reintegrate  into  society.  Justice  Served  diverts  resources  away  from  its  other  work  in this \narea to  educate  people,  including  people  disenfranchised  under N.C.G.S.  §  13-1,  about their \nvoting  rights  (or  lack  thereof),  and  to  registering  them  to  vote  (in  accordance  with  current North \nCarolina  law).  Justice  Served  also  provides  community-based  alternatives  to  incarceration  and \nfacilitates  mentorship  programs  for people  with  involvement  in the  criminal justice  system \ngeared  at  helping  them transition into  civic  life. \n11.  Plaintiff North  Carolina  State  Conference  of the  NAACP  (“North  Carolina \nNAACP”)  is  a nonpartisan,  nonprofit  organization composed  of over  100  branches  and  20,000 \nindividual  members  throughout  the  state  of North  Carolina.  The  North  Carolina NAACP  has \nmembers  who  are  citizens  but  are  unable  to  vote  due  to  a prior  felony  conviction  despite  having \nbeen  released  from  incarceration,  under N.C.G.S.A.  §  13-1.  The  fundamental  mission  of the \nNorth  Carolina NAACP  is  the  advancement  and  improvement  of the  political,  civil,  educational, \nsocial,  and  economic  status  of minority  groups;  the  elimination  of racial  prejudice;  the \npublicizing  of adverse  effects  of racial  discrimination;  and the  initiation  of lawful  action to \nsecure  the  elimination  of racial  bias.  In  furtherance  of this  mission,  the  North  Carolina NAACP \nadvocates  to  ensure  that the  interests  of the  African  American  community  and  people  of color  are \nrepresented  on the  local,  state,  and  national  legislative  bodies  by  representatives  who  share  the \ncommunity’s  interests,  values,  and  beliefs,  and  who  will  be  accountable  to  the  community.  The \nNorth  Carolina NAACP  thus  encourages  and facilitates  nonpartisan voter registration drives by \nits  chapters  to  promote  civic  participation.  The North  Carolina NAACP  is  currently  forced to\ndivert  organizational  resources  away  from  activities  core  to  its  mission  in  furtherance  of \neducation  and  voter  engagement  efforts  required  to  assist  potential  voters  in North  Carolina in \nunderstanding North  Carolina’s  felony-based  disenfranchisement  laws. \n12.  Defendant  Timothy  K.  Moore  is  the  Speaker  of the North  Carolina House  of \nRepresentatives.  Defendant  Moore  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity  only. \n13.  Defendant  Philip  E.  Berger  is the  President  Pro  Tempore  of the  North Carolina \nSenate.  Defendant  Berger  is  sued  in his  official  capacity  only. \n14.  Defendant North  Carolina  State  Board  of Elections  is  an  agency  responsible  for \nthe  regulation  and  administration  of elections  in North  Carolina. \n15.  Defendant  Damon  Circosta  is  the  Chair  of the  North  Carolina  State  Board  of \nElections.  Mr.  Circosta  is  sued  in his  official  capacity  only. \n16.  Defendant  Stella Anderson  is  the  Secretary  of the North  Carolina  State  Board  of \nElections.  Ms.  Anderson  is  sued  in her  official  capacity  only. \n17.  Defendant  Ken Raymond  is  a  member  of the  North  Carolina  State  Board  of \nElections.  Mr.  Raymond  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity  only. \n18.  Defendant  Jeff Carmon III  is  a member  of the North  Carolina  State  Board  of \nElections.  Mr.  Carmon  is  sued  in his  official  capacity  only. \n19.  Defendant  David  C.  Black  is  a member  of the North  Carolina  State  Board  of \nElections.  Mr.  Black  is  sued  in his  official  capacity  only. \nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n20.  This  Court  has jurisdiction  over this  action  pursuant  to  Articles  26  and  26A  of \nChapter  1  of the  General  Statutes.\n21.  Under  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1-267.1,  the  exclusive  venue  for this  action  is  the  Wake \nCounty  Superior  Court. \n22.  Under N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  1-267.1,  a three-judge  court  must be  convened  because \nthis  action  involves  a facial  challenge  to  the validity  of an act  of the  General  Assembly. \nFACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Felony  Disenfranchisement  Has  Long  Been  Used  in  North  Carolina  to \nSuppress  the  Political  Power  of African  Americans \n23.  While  North  Carolina  statutory  law has  provided  for  felony  disenfranchisement \nsince  before  the  Civil  War,  the  policy  of denying  the  right to  vote  to  North  Carolinians  with \nfelony  convictions  was  both  constitutionalized  and  weaponized  in  the  period  after  the  Civil  War \nin  an  unambiguous  effort to  stifle  the  political  power  of African-American  voters. \n24.  North  Carolina  is  not  unique  in  this  regard.  “Felon voting  restrictions  were  the \nfirst  widespread  set  of legal  disenfranchisement  measures  imposed  on  African  Americans;  the \nliteracy  tests  and  other  mechanisms  for political  exclusion  followed  at  a  later  date.”  Daniel  S. \nGoldman,  The Modern-Day Literacy  Test:  Felon Disenfranchisement and Race  Discrimination, \n57  Stan.  L.  Rev.  611,  625  (2004).  These  disenfranchisement  laws  proliferated  as  the \nimprisonment  of African  Americans  increased.  By  the  1870’s,  nearly  95%  of persons  with \nfelony  convictions  in  southern  states  were  African Americans.  See  Christopher  Adamson, \nPunishment After Slavery:  Southern  Penal Systems,  1865-1890,  Oxford University  Press  (1983). \n25.  These  disenfranchisement  laws  served  to  stifle  the  perceived  threat  of new \nAfrican-American voters.  See  Goldman,  57  Stan.  L.  Rev.  at  626.  “Narrower  in  scope  than \nliteracy  tests  or poll  taxes  and  easier to justify than understanding  or grandfather  clauses, \ncriminal  disenfranchisement  laws  provided the  southern  states with  insurance  if courts  struck \ndown  more  blatantly  unconstitutional  clauses.”  Jd.\n26.  In North  Carolina,  African  Americans  gained  political power  after  the  Civil  War. \nThe  State’s  new  constitution  adopted  in  1868  provided  for universal  male  suffrage,  eliminated \nproperty  requirements  to  vote,  and  abolished  slavery.  See  N.C.  Const.  of 1868,  art.  1,  §  33;  id. \nart.  VI,  §  1.  In the  years  that  followed,  African  Americans  achieved  some  success  in  municipal, \nstate  legislative,  and  even  congressional  elections.  See  William  Mabry,  White  Supremacy  and \nthe  North  Carolina  Suffrage Amendment,  13  N.C.  Hist.  Rev.  1  (1936);  see  also,  ¢.g., \nBiographical  Directory  of the  United  States  Congress,  John Adams  Hyman;  Biographical \nDirectory  of the  United  States  Congress,  James E.  O’Hara. \n27.  Over  the  next  several  decades,  the North  Carolina  General  Assembly  gradually \neliminated  African-American political  power.  In  1875,  the  General  Assembly  enacted a  flurry  of \namendments  to  the  state  constitution  aimed  at  eroding  the  rights  of African Americans.  The \n1875  Amendments  required  segregation in public  schools  and  banned  interracial  marriage.  See \n1875  Amendments  to  the  N.C.  Const.  of  1868,  Amends.  XXVI  &  XXX.  They  also  directly \nassaulted  the  political  rights  of African  Americans by  giving  the  General  Assembly  the  power to \nappoint  township  and  county  officials.  See  id  Amend.  XXV.  “The  purpose  of this  amendment, \nas  was  well  understood,  was  to  block  control  of local  government  in the  eastern  counties  by \nblacks  who  were  in  the  majority there.”  John  V.  Orth,  North  Carolina  Constitution  History,  70 \nN.C.  L.  Rev.  1759,  1783  (1992). \n28.  Particularly  relevant  here,  the  1875  Amendments  added  a provision to  the \nconstitution  concerning  felony  disenfranchisement.  See  1875  Amendments  to  the  N.C.  Const.  of \n1868,  Amend.  XXIV.  The  text  of the  original  1875  felony  disenfranchisement  amendment \nlargely  mirrors the  analogous provision  in North  Carolina’s  current  constitution.  The  1875 \namendment provided:\n[N]o  person,  upon  conviction  or  confession in open  Court,  shall  be  adjudged  guilty \nof felony,  or  of  any  other  crime  infamous  by  the  laws  of this  state,  and  hereafter \ncommitted,  shall  be  deemed  an  elector,  unless  such  person  shall  be  restored  to  the \nrights  of citizenship  in  a mode  prescribed  by  law. \n1875  Amendments  to  the N.C.  Const.  of  1868,  Amend.  XXIV. \n29.  In the  years  following  enactment  of the  1875  Amendments,  North  Carolina’s \nthen-Democratic  Party  championed  “rigid  safeguards”  against  voting  by  “ex-convicts,”  State \nDemocratic  Executive  Committee  of North  Carolina,  The  Democratic  Handbook (1898)  at  84, \nand  sought  to  implement those  “safeguards”  after  they  finally  regained  power  from African \nAmericans  and the  Republican-Populist ticket  in  1898. \n30.  In the  leadup  to  the  1898  election,  the  then-Democratic  Party  ran  “a vicious  racist \ncampaign the  likes  of which the  state  had never  seen.”  William  S.  Powell,  North  Carolina \nthrough  Four  Centuries,  433  (1989).  The  campaign  expressly  emphasized  the  need  for  “white \nmen  [to]  control  and  govern”  the  State.  State  Democratic  Executive  Committee  of North \nCarolina,  The  Democratic  Handbook (1898)  at  38;  see  also  id.  (“It  is  better for the  negro,  as  well \nas  for the  white  man,  that the  white  man  should  make  and  administer  the  laws .  .  .  .  It has  been  in \nthe  past,  and  is  to-day,  the  special  mission  of the  Democratic  Party  to  rescue  the  white  people  of \nthe  east[ern part  of the  State]  from the  curse  of negro  domination.”).  The  party  sent  “persuasive \nspeakers  into  virtually  every  community  in North Carolina to  report  on the  evils  of Negro \ndomination”  and  widely  circulated a  letter  “calling upon  whites  to  stand  together  in  support  of \n‘White  Supremacy.””  North  Carolina  through  Four  Centuries  at  433-35.  The  campaign  also \nfeatured  racist newspaper  editorials  and  cartoons  showing  the  threat purportedly  posed by \nAfrican  American political  influence,  including  the  following  cartoon  featured in the  Raleigh \nNews  &  Observer  on  October  27,  1898:\n   \nDw \neae \na \n \n\\ \n   \nS\nS\n \nL\nL\nE - \nW  \nT s\nA e\n    tC \n \neone \nSee  “A  Vampire  that  Hovers  Over North  Carolina,”  UNC Libraries.' \n31.  In  plotting their return to  power,  the  turn-of the-century  Democrats  observed  with \nalarm  that  “fully  one-third  [of votes  in North  Carolina]  is  cast  by  the negroes”  and  partially \nattributed  that  number  to  voting  by  people  with  felony  convictions.  See  id.  at  37,  88.  They \nfurther  observed that  restrictions  on voting  by  people  with  felony  convictions  were  needed  “in \norder  to protect the white  voters  of the  State  against  having their honest votes  off-set by  illegally \nand  fraudulently registered negro  votes.”  Id.  at  84;  see  also  id.  at  88  (explaining  that “negro  ex- \nconvicts  .  ..  were  registered  and  voted  galore  .  .  .  leav[ing]  to  the  white  voters  of North  Carolina \nno  protection  against this  fraudulent registration  save  what  their  courage  and  Anglo-Saxon \nmanhood  may  give  them”). \n32.  Democrats prevailed  in  the  1898  election,  regaining  control  of the  General \nAssembly.  The  victory  was  interpreted  as  “an ultimatum to  curb the  political  power of the \n  \n)  https://exhibits. lib.unc.edu/items/show/2215.\n    \nNegro.”  William  Mabry,  White  Supremacy  and the  North  Carolina  Suffrage Amendment,  13 \nN.C.  Hist.  Rev.  1  (1936). \n33.  Over the  next  several  years,  the  General  Assembly  enacted  numerous  laws \ndesigned  to  suppress  African-American  political  power,  including a  literacy  test  (that exempted \nwhite  citizens)  and a  poll  tax.  See  id. \n34.  The  statutory  disenfranchisement  scheme  from  1905  mandated  that  people  with \nfelony  convictions  remained  disenfranchised  for  a period  of time  even  after  their release  from \nincarceration.  See  N.C.  Rev.  1905,  ch.  64  §§  2675-79.  Under this  scheme,  people  with  felony \nconvictions  needed to  file  a petition with the  superior  court  seeking  restoration  of their  voting \nrights,  id  §  2675,  but  such petitions  could  not be  filed  until  “after  the  expiration  of four years \nfrom  the  date  of conviction,”  id.  §  2676. \n35.  Although  today’s  felony  disenfranchisement  regime  eliminates  the  requirement \nthat  people  petition a  court  for  restoration  of their  voting  rights,  it preserves  a  core  feature  of its \nprecursors—namely  continued  disenfranchisement  even  after  a person  is  not  incarcerated. \nB.  Today’s  Law  Prolongs  Disenfranchisement  Through  Probation  and  Parole \n36.  Adopted  in  1971,  the  current  felony  disenfranchisement  provision  of the  North \nCarolina  Constitution provides  as  follows: \nDisqualification  of felon.  No  person  adjudged  guilty  of a felony  against  this  State \nor  the  United  States,  or  adjudged  guilty  of a  felony  in  another  state  that  also \nwould  be  a felony  if it had been  committed  in  this  State,  shall  be  permitted  to  vote \nunless  that person  shall  be  first restored  to  the  rights  of citizenship  in the  manner \nprescribed  by  law. \nN.C.  Const.,  Art.  VI,  §  2,  cl.  3. \n37.  Also  in  1971,  the  General  Assembly  enacted  a new felony  disenfranchisement \nstatute  maintaining  the  prior policy  of disenfranchising  people  even  after release  from \nincarceration.  Specifically,  the  1971  statute  provided  that people  with  felony  convictions \n10\nregained  the  right to  vote  if either  “the  Department  of Correction  at the  time  of release \nrecommended]  restoration”  or  “two  years  have  elapsed  since  release  by  the  Department  of \nCorrection,  including probation  or parole.”  See \nhttps://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/sessionlaws/pdf/1971-1972/sl1971-902.pdf (emphasis \nadded). \n38.  The  General  Assembly  amended  this  statute  in  1973,  adopting the  essential \nlanguage  that  is  currently  in  effect—namely,  that  people  with  felony  convictions  regain the  right \nto  vote  only  upon  an  “unconditional  discharge”  not only  from  incarceration,  but  also  from \nprobation,  parole,  or  a  suspended  sentence.  See \nhttps://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/SessionLaws/PDF/1973-1974/SL1973-251 pdf. \n39.  The  current  statute,  last  amended  in 2013,  provides  as  follows: \nAny  person  convicted  of a  crime,  whereby  the  rights  of citizenship  are  forfeited, \nshall  have  such  rights  automatically  restored upon the  occurrence  of any  one  of \nthe  following  conditions: \n(1)  The  unconditional  discharge  of an  inmate,  of a probationer,  or  of a parolee  by \nthe  agency  of the  State  having jurisdiction  of that person  or  of a  defendant under  a \nsuspended  sentence  by  the  court. \n(2)  The  unconditional  pardon  of the  offender. \n(3)  The  satisfaction  by  the  offender of all  conditions  of a  conditional  pardon. \n(4)  With regard to  any  person  convicted  of a  crime  against  the United  States,  the \nunconditional  discharge  of such person  by  the  agency  of the  United  States  having \njurisdiction  of such person,  the  unconditional  pardon  of such person  or  the \nsatisfaction  by  such person  of a  conditional  pardon. \n(5)  With regard to  any  person  convicted  of a  crime  in  another  state,  the \nunconditional  discharge  of such person  by  the  agency  of that  state  having \njurisdiction  of such person,  the  unconditional  pardon  of such  person  or the \nsatisfaction  by  such person  of a  conditional  pardon. \nN.C.G.S.A.  §  13-1. \n11\n40.  Under  this  law,  North  Carolinians  who  have  been released  from  incarceration  but \nhave  not  been  “unconditionally  discharged”  from  probation  or post-release  supervision  cannot \nvote.  Additionally,  North  Carolinians  who  have  been  convicted  of a felony  and  are  sentenced  to \ncommunity  supervision  without incarceration  cannot  vote. \n41.  The  terms  of this  law extend the  disenfranchisement  of people  already  deemed  fit \nto  return  to  or remain  in  society.  The  requirement that  a person complete  any term  of parole  or \npost-release  supervision  can  delay  restoration  of the  right to  vote  by  at  least  one  year  after  the \nperson’s  release  from  incarceration.  See  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1372(a).  And  the requirement that  a \nperson  complete  any  term  of probation  imposes  delays  that  are  typically  even  longer—and  of \nuncertain  duration  due  to  the  potential  for modifications,  extensions,  or  early  termination.  See \nN.C.G.S.  §  15A-1344(a),  (d);  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1342(a). \n42.  Once  an  individual  is  on probation,  a  court  has  the power  “at  any  time” prior to \nthe  termination  of probation  to  extend the  period  of probation  “for  good  cause,”  regardless  of \nwhether  that person  has  violated probation.  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1344(d).  Probation hearings, \nwhether to  revoke  or  extend,  are  “regarded  as  informal  or  summary”  and  provide  minimal  due \nprocess  protections.  State  v.  Sellars,  185  N.C.  App.  726,  728,  649  S.E.2d  656,  657  (2007).  With \nevery  extension  of probation,  that  person’s  disenfranchisement  is  likewise  extended. \n43,  In 2018,  “Property  and  non-trafficking  drug  offenses  comprised  76%  of probation \nsentences.”  North Carolina  Sentencing  &  Policy Advisory  Commission,  Structured  Sentencing \nStatistical  Report  at  22,  24  (2018). \n44.  According  to  recent  data  from the North  Carolina Sentencing  and  Policy  Advisory \nCommission,  the  average  length  of probation  for  “intermediate”  felony  convictions  (i.e.,  for \nClass  D,  E,  F,  G,  H,  or  I  felony  offenses)  is  26  months.  See  North  Carolina  Sentencing  &  Policy \n12\nAdvisory  Commission,  Structured  Sentencing  Statistical  Report  at  23  (2018).  The  average \nlength  of probation  is  longer  for more  serious  felony  offenses.  Class  D  felony  offenses,  for \ninstance,  carry  an average probation period  of 42  months.  Id. \nC.  Today’s  Law  Conditions  the  Right  to  Vote  on  the  Ability  to  Pay  Court  Costs \n45.  Because  North  Carolina  law requires  the  payment of court  costs,  fees,  and \nrestitution  as  a  condition  of probation,  North  Carolina’s  disenfranchisement  statute,  N.C.G.S.  § \n13-1,  effectively  conditions  the  right to  vote  on  a person’s  ability  to  pay.  As  a  result,  people  who \nhave  otherwise  completed  the  terms  of their probation but  cannot  afford  to  pay  court  costs  are \ndenied  the  right to  vote  due  to  the  continuation on their probation.  By  contrast,  otherwise \nsimilarly  situated  people  who  can  pay  will  be  discharged  from probation  and  regain the  right to \nvote. \n46.  North  Carolina  law provides  that  “[a]s  regular  conditions  of probation,  a \ndefendant  must  .  .  .  [p]ay  the  costs  of court,  any  fine  ordered  by  the  court,  and  make  restitution or \nreparation  as  provided  in  subsection  (d).”  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1343(b)(9).  Court  costs  in North \nCarolina have  increased  400%  over the  past  twenty  years.  See  Heather  Hunt  and  Gene  Nichol, \nCourt Fines  and Fees:  Criminalizing Poverty  in North  Carolina  (“Criminalizing Poverty”)  at  4, \nNorth  Carolina  Poverty  Research  Fund  (2017).  In  1999,  a North  Carolinian charged  with a \nfelony  would  face a  total  of $106  in court  fines  and  fees.  ACLU  of North  Carolina,  The \nConsequences  of Rising  Court  Fines  and  Fees  in North  Carolina  (“ACLU  Report”)  at  10  (2019). \nBut  today,  “$106  would  barely  cover  two-thirds  of the  General  Court  of Justice  fee  in  district \ncourt.”  Id. \n  \n2  Data is not presently available for the  average  length of probation  for Class B  or C  felony  offenses.  Probation is \nnot  available for Class A felony  offenses.  See N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1340.17. \n13\n47.  Notwithstanding  the  fact that the  overwhelming  majority  of people  who  are \ncriminal  defendants  in North  Carolina are  indigent,  the  General  Assembly  has  imposed  a  wide \narray  of court  costs  on those  defendants  who  are  convicted  or plead  guilty  in  Superior  Court, \nwhich  has jurisdiction  over  all  felony  cases.  These  costs  include: \n General  Court  of Justice  Fee   $154.00 \n Facilities  Fee   $30.00 \n Telecommunications  Fee   $4.00 \n Fee  “[f]or the retirement and  insurance   $6.25 \nbenefits  of .  .  .  law  enforcement  officers” \n Fee  “for  the  supplemental  pension benefits  of   $1.25 \nsheriffs” \n    Fee  “[flor  the  services,  staffing,  and      $2.00    \noperations  of the  Criminal  Justice  Education \nand  Standards  Commission” \n Pretrial  Release  Services  Fee   $15.00 \n Fee  “[flor  each  arrest  or personal  service  of   $5.00 \ncriminal  process” \n DNA  Fee   $2.00 \n  \nSee  N.C.G.S.  §  7A-304(a)(1)-(13).  Individuals  who  are  unable  to  pay  these  fees  “within 40  days \nof the  date  specified  in the  court’s judgment”  must  additionally  pay  a  late  fee  of $50.00.  Jd.  § \n7A-304(a)(6). \n48.  The  General  Assembly  has  also  imposed  significant  costs  arising  from probation \nitself.  People  must  “[p]ay  the  State  of North  Carolina  for the  costs  of appointed  counsel,  public \ndefender,  or  appellate  defender to represent  him in the  case(s)  for  which he  was  placed  on \nprobation.”  Jd.  §  15A-1343(b)(10).  They  also  must  “[p]ay  a  supervision fee”  of $40.00  per \nmonth.  Jd  §  15A-1343(b)(6),  (cl).  Given that  the  average  person  convicted  of an  intermediate \nfelony  will  serve  26  months  of probation,  the  average  person  must  pay  $1,040  in  supervision  fees \nalone  to  satisfy  the  terms  of their  probation.  On top  of that,  “[a]ny  person placed  on  house  arrest \nwith  electronic  monitoring  ..  .  shall  pay  a  fee  of ninety  dollars  ($90.00)  for the  electronic \n14\nmonitoring  device  and a  daily  fee  in  an  amount that  reflects  the  actual  cost  of providing  the \nelectronic  monitoring.”  Id.  §  15A-1343(c2). \n49.  These  required  payments  impose  substantial  hardships  on  criminal  defendants, \nmany  of whom  lack  the  requisite  resources  to  make  them.  Nationally,  around  80  to  90%  of those \ncharged  with  a  criminal  offense  are  poor  enough to  qualify  for  a  court-appointed  lawyer. \nCriminalizing Poverty  at  6.  And  60%  of those  charged  earned  less  than  $1,000 per  month  before \ntheir  incarceration.  Jd.  In North  Carolina,  people  released  from  incarceration  are  often unable  to \nobtain  employment  enabling them  to  pay  these  substantial  fees  given  that  30%  have  no  more \nthan  a ninth-grade  education,  and  less  than  1%  have  a  college  education.  Id \n50.  | While  North  Carolina law  allows judges  to  waive  certain  court  costs  for  “just \ncause,” N.C.G.S.  §  7A-304,  waivers  are  exceedingly  rare.  In  2018, judges  issued  waivers  in  only \n3%  of cases.  See  North  Carolina Administrative  Office  of the  Courts,  2019  Report  on  Criminal \nCost  Waivers  at  35  (2019).  While  the  rate  at which judges  grant  cost  waivers  has  always  been \nlow,  the rate  has plummeted  even further  after  the  General  Assembly  enacted  a  law  in  2015 \nrequiring  the  Administrative  Office  of the  Courts  to  track the  number  of times  individual judges \nissued waivers.  See  ACLU  Report,  at  13-15;  N.C.G.S.  §  7A-350. \n51.  | Making  matters  worse, judges  rarely  inquire  into  a defendant’s  ability  to  pay  court \ncosts  even though  nearly  90%  of persons  charged with  a  crime  are  indigent.  According to  recent \ncourt  observations  in  Robeson,  Edgecombe,  and Avery  Counties,  “a  defendant’s  ability  to  pay \ncourt  fines  and  fees  was  weighed  in  24  percent,  5  percent,  and  25  percent  of cases,  respectively.” \nACLU  Report  at  15  n.43. \n52.  Payment  of the  fees  discussed  above  is  a  “condition  of probation.”  N.C.G.S.A. \n§  15A-1343.  And  failing  to  make  these  payments  constitutes  a  “violation  of a  condition  of \n15\nprobation”  that  authorizes  the  court to  extend the  term  of probation—and  thus  the  denial  of the \nright  to  vote—to  a maximum  of five  years.  Id.  §  15A-1344(a),  (d).  A  court  may  extend  the  term \nof probation  for people  convicted  of felonies  by  an  additional  three  years  “for the  purpose  of \nallowing  the  defendant to  complete  a program  of restitution.”  Jd.  §  15A-1342(a). \n53.  Notwithstanding  high  rates  of indigence  and  the  failure  of courts  to  assess  ability \nto  pay,  people  are  regularly  arrested  and  subjected to  extended  periods  of probation  for  failing  to \npay  court  fines.  See  ACLU  Report  at  24-30.  For  example,  out  of  110  court  observations \nconducted  in  Robeson  County  in 2017,  “[a]  staggering  32  observations  ended  in  an  individual \nincarcerated  for failure to  pay  fees  and  fines.”  Jd.  at 24.  Even when  people  have  otherwise \ncomplied  with the  terms  of their probation,  courts  will  extend  the  period  of probation for  failing \nto  pay  costs.  See  id.  at  29-30.  The  result  is  that people  remain  disenfranchised  based  on their \ninability  to  pay  court  costs. \nD.  Today’s  Law  Deprives  Roughly  70,000  North  Carolinians  of the  Right  to \nVote  Even  Though  They  Have  Been  Released  From  Incarceration \n54.  North  Carolina  law does  not  require  state  authorities  to  notify  people  when  their \nrights  are  restored.  Although  the  law requires  the  State  Board  of Elections  (“State  Board”  or \n“SBOE”)  to  inform people  after a felony  conviction  of their  loss  of voting  rights  by mail,  see \nN.C.G.S.A.  §  163.82.14(c)(3)  (previously  codified  at  §  163A-877),  no  comparable  law requires \nthe  State  Board  to  notify  people  when their rights  are  restored  following  their  “unconditional \ndischarge”  from  any  state-ordered  probation  or parole. \n55.  Even  after people’s  rights  are  restored,  some  sit  out  elections  based  on  fear that \nthey  will  be  prosecuted  for  voting  illegally.  This  lack  of clarity  is  particularly  problematic  for \npeople  with  felony  convictions,  who  disproportionately  have  low  levels  of education.  Trial \ncourts  sometimes  order this  narrow-purpose  extension in  error,  leaving  people  convicted  of \n16\nfelonies  on probation for  additional  years  without  legal  authority.  See  State  v.  Hoskins,  242  N.C. \nApp.  168,  775  S.E.2d  15  (2015)  (holding  that  trial  court  lacked  authority  for three-year  extension \nand  vacating  probation  violation  order  after  defendant  completed  full  eight  years  of probation). \n56.  Under North  Carolina law,  “a  superior  court judge may  not  accept  a plea  of guilty \nor  no  contest  from  the  defendant  without  first  addressing  him  personally”  and  informing  that \nperson  of certain rights  and  effects  of the  guilty  plea,  including  possible  immigration \nconsequences.  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1022(a).  The  standard plea transcript  form  sets  out  additional \nadmonitions,  including that  “you may  forfeit  any  State  licensing privileges  you have  in the  event \nthat your  probation  is revoked.”  Form  AOC-CR-300.  Neither the  statute  nor the  form  makes \nany  mention  of the  loss  or  restoration  of the  right to  vote. \n57.  As  with  loss  of the right to  vote,  the  trial  court  is  not  required to  inform  an \nindividual  of the  existence  of post-release  supervision  as  part  of a  guilty  plea.  As  one  criminal \njustice  scholar  has  noted,  this  leads  to  widespread  misunderstanding: \nI  get  a  lot  of mail  from  inmates.  Lately,  many  of them  have  written  to  express \ntheir  surprise  upon being  told  by  prison  officials—for  the  first  time—that  they \nwill  have  to  complete  a  term  of post-release  supervision  when they  get  out  of \nprison.  Sex  offenders—especially  Class  F-I  sex  offenders,  including  those \nconvicted  of indecent  liberties—are  very  surprised  to  learn that they  will  be  on \nPRS  for  five  years. \nJamie  Markham,  “Surprise  Post-Release  Supervision,”  North  Carolina  Criminal Law  Blog  (June \n11,  2015).  Paradoxically,  this  surprise  period  of additional  disenfranchisement  based  on \nsupervision  includes  conditions  that  allow people  released  from  incarceration  to  obtain  credits \nfor  “reintegration  into  society”.  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1368.4(d). \n58.  According  to  a  2017  estimate,  69,386  North  Carolina voting-aged  citizens  are \nunable  to  vote  because  they  remain  on  felony  probation  or post-release  supervision.  See \nSouthern  Coalition  for  Social  Justice,  The  Freedom  to  Vote:  Felony  Disenfranchisement  in North \n17\nCarolina  at  5  (August  2019)  (“Southern  Coalition  Report”).  These  estimates  do  not  capture \nthose  who  are  eligible  to  vote  but  remain  off the rolls  due  to  misinformation  or  fear  of \nprosecution.  Indeed,  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  calculate  the  full  extent  of disenfranchisement \ndue  to  the  persistent  failure  of state  authorities  to  inform  people  with  felony  convictions  about \ntheir  voting  rights. \n59.  These  nearly  70,000  North  Carolinians  disenfranchised  by  the  state  are  among \nthose  whom  CSI,  Justice  Served,  and the North  Carolina NAACP  help  transition  back  into \nsociety,  work  with to  provide  resources  as  they  overcome  the  collateral  consequences  of their \ncriminal  convictions,  and  assist  in  understanding  their  voting  rights.  Voting  restrictions  on these \ncitizens  force  these  organizational plaintiffs  to  divert  resources  toward  voting  rights  education \nefforts  and  away  from  other  programming  initiatives  including  those  geared  at  facilitating \nreintegration,  providing  necessary  resources  for  employment,  housing,  and  other  basic  needs, \nand  otherwise  assisting  their  full  civic  engagement. \n60.  | The  number of North  Carolinians  effected  by  probation  or post-release  felony \ndisenfranchisement  is  substantial  compared  to  the  narrow margins  of victories  by  which  elections \nin North  Carolina  are  often  decided.  In  2014,  for  example,  a  nonpartisan  election  for  District \nCourt Judge  was  decided  by  five votes  out  of more  than  60,000  votes  cast,  with the  winner \nprevailing  by  a margin  of 30,746  to  30,741.  See  SBOE,  2014  Election  Results.  Municipal \nelections  are  often  decided  by  comparably  small  margins.  In November  2019,  for  example,  a \nnonpartisan  city  council race  in  Burlington,  North  Carolina was  decided  by  a margin  of 2,780  to \n  \n3  https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/04/2014&county_id=0&office-JUD&contest=0. \n18\n2,739.  See  SBOE,  2019  Election  Results.*  Similarly,  elections  to the  General  Assembly  are \noften  decided  by just hundreds  of votes.  See,  e.g.,  SBOE,  2018  Election Results.’ \n61.  By  denying  the  fundamental  right to  vote  to  substantial  numbers  of voting-aged \ncitizens  who  are  otherwise  full participants  in  society,  North  Carolina’s  felony \ndisenfranchisement  laws  create  a  significant  risk that  election  results  may  not reflect the  will  of \nthe  majority. \nE.  Today’s  Law  Disproportionately  Disenfranchises  African  Americans \n62.  Today,  as  in the  Jim-Crow  era,  the  policy  of disenfranchising  people  even  after \ntheir  release  from  incarceration continues  to  disproportionately  harm people  of color today. \nAlthough African Americans  represent  about  20%  of the  voting  population  in North  Carolina, \nthey  represent roughly  40%  of the  people  disenfranchised  following  release  from  incarceration. \nSee  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Annual Estimates  of the Resident Population  by  Sex,  Age,  Race Alone \nor  in  Combination  (2018).  African-American  men,  in particular,  comprise  a disproportionate \npercentage  of the  post-release  supervision population.  According  to  data  from  2017,  black men \nmake  up  9.2%  of the North  Carolina voting  age population,  but comprise  40%  of the  male \nprobation population  in  the  state.  See  id.  Black  women  are  nearly  11%  of the  voting  population, \nbut  comprise  about  24%  of the  female  probation population.  See  id. \n63.  Unsurprisingly,  the  burdens  of North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  law \nfall  disproportionately  on the  eastern part  of the  State,  where  much of North  Carolina’s  African \nAmerican population  resides. \n  \n4 https://er.ncsbe.gow/?election_dt=11/05/2019&county_id-O&office=CCL&contest=0. \n5 https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/06/2018&county_id-0&office=FED&contest=0. \n19\n—  _~ttseresttotemeeretemasienminii  tient  tteesnsnnsnnetssn  sss  — \nPercentage  of  18+  Population  Under  Probation  by  County  (2017) \n     \n  \nDisentranchisemant Rate \nO.27% - 0.77% \n|  O 78% ~ 1.02% \n     \nQO  1.03% - 1.4% \nGRE  1 87% - 1.34% \n   Poputetiont Osta.  2040 Cangua  2017 NG Avdomatad Garesal Inhachins System ACIS; Date \n  \nSee  Southern  Coalition Report  at  7;  see  also  id.  at  22-44  (providing  data on  county-by-county \ndisenfranchisement  rates). \nF.  There  Is  No  Legitimate  Government  Interest  in  Continuing to  Disenfranchise \nPeople With  Past  Felony  Convictions Who  Live in  North  Carolina \nCommunities \n64.  There  is  no  legitimate,  let  alone  compelling,  government  interest  in  continuing  to \ndisenfranchise  people  with past  felony  convictions  who  live  in North  Carolina  communities  and \nare  subject to  the  laws  and policies  enacted  by  elected  officials. \n65.  On the  contrary,  research  overwhelmingly  shows  that  civic  engagement plays  a \ncritical  role  in helping persons  with  felony  convictions  re-join  society.  As  one  study  observes, \n  \n“[pJeople  who  are part  of the  decision  making process  not  only  have  a  greater  investment  in the \ndecisions,  but  a  greater  investment  in  society  as  well...  .  Those  who  participate  in the \ndemocratic  process  have  a  greater  investment  in the  resulting  decisions,  and  more  importantly, \n20\nan  investment  in preserving  that process.”  See  Holona  Leanne  Ochs,  “Colorblind”  Policy  in \nBlack and  White:  Racial  Consequences  of Disenfranchisement Policy,  34  Pol’y  Stud.  J.  81,  89 \n(2006).  Another  found that  the  “desire  to  be  productive  and  give  something  back to  society”  was \ncritical  to reintegration.  See  Christopher Uggen  et al.,  ‘Less  Than  the Average  Citizen’:  Stigma, \nRole  Transition  and the  Civic  Reintegration  of Convicted Felons,  in After  Crime  and \nPunishment:  Pathways  to  Offender Reintegration  263  (Shadd  Maruna  &  Russ  Immarigeon  eds., \n2004). \n66.  Studies  also  show that  civically  engaged  citizens  are  less  likely  to  recidivate.  The \ndata  shows  that  “bringing  people  into  the  political process  makes  them  stakeholders,  which  in \nturn helps  steer  them away  from  future  crimes.”  Brennan  Center  for Justice:  Florida:  An  Outlier \nin  Denying  Voting  Rights  at  18  (2016).  For  example,  Florida  (which until  2019  required  felons \nto  affirmatively  petition to  have  their rights  restored)  has  published  data comparing  recidivism \nrates  among  people  previously  convicted  of felonies  who  have  been  re-enfranchised  to  those  who \nremain  disenfranchised,  and  the  numbers  are  stunning.  Although  the  average  annual  recidivism \nrate  in  Florida is  around  30  percent,  virtually no  one  who  had  their rights  restored re-offended. \nSee  id.  (“In  2011,  of the  52  people  granted  [restoration  of civil  rights  ““RCR”)],  zero  were \nreturned to  custody.  In  2012,  out  of the  342  people  granted  RCR,  only  one  re-offended.  In \n2013,  out  of 569  people  granted  RCR,  zero  re-offended.  In  2014,  of 562  people  granted  RCR, \nthree  re-offended.  In  2015,  of 427  people  granted  RCR,  one  re-offended.”). \n67.  Voting  restrictions  on citizens  no  longer  incarcerated  (or who  never  were \nincarcerated)  also  harm  entire  families.  Studies  show that when  heads  of households  are \ndisenfranchised,  the  level  of civic  engagement  for the  entire  family  drops.  See  Erika  Wood, \nRestoring  the  Right to  Vote,  Brennan  Ctr.  for  Justice,  at  13  (2009).  Children frequently  learn \n21\nabout  the  importance  of voting  from their  parents.  Many  parents  take  their  children  with them \ninto  the  voting booth—a formative  experience  that is  often  a child’s  first  act  of civic \nengagement.  See  id.  (explaining  that  “[a]  parent’s  electoral  participation plays  a  significant role \nin  determining  whether  his  child will  become  civically  engaged”).  According  to  one  study,  a \nparent’s  political  participation  has  more  influence  on a  child’s  decision  to  vote  in the  future  than \nany  other  factor.  See  Eric  Plutzer,  Becoming a Habitual  Voter:  Inertia,  Resources,  and Growth \nin  Young Adulthood,  96  Am.  Pol.  Sci.  Rev.  41,  43  (2002).  The  ripple  effects  of \ndisenfranchisement  are  felt  across  generations. \n68.  For  these  reasons,  probation and  parole  officers—who  work  with persons  with \nfelony  convictions  and  are  among  the  closest to  understanding  the  relevant  interests  at  stake— \nfrequently  assert  that  voting  restrictions  lack  a  coherent justification.  See  Amicus  Br.  of \nAmerican  Probation  &  Parole  Assoc.  at  13-15,  Hand v.  Scott,  NO.  18-11388  (11th  Cir.  2018) \n(“Probation  and parole  officers  are  the  state  officials  most  directly  responsible  for  reintegrating \noffenders  back  into  society  after their  term  of imprisonment.  Among  these  officers,  there  is  a \ngrowing  consensus  that  voting  plays  an  important role  in  the  reintegration process.”).  The \nAmerican  Probation  and  Parole  Association,  the  American  Correctional  Association,  and the \nAssociation  of Paroling  Authorities  International  have  each  enacted  resolutions  supporting  the \nrestoration  of voting  rights  for  persons  with  felony  convictions.  See  id.  The  American \nCorrectional  Association maintains,  for  example,  that  voting restrictions  on a person  after \nsuccessful  discharge  from  correctional  supervision  is  “contradictory  to  the  goals  of a  democracy, \nthe  rehabilitation  of felons,  and their  successful  reentry  to  the  community.”  Am.  Corr.  Ass’n, \nPublic  Correctional Policy  on Restoration  of Voting Rights for Felony  Offenders  2005-3,  in \nPublic  Correctional Policies  73  (Jan.  25,  2017). \n22\n69.  Prosecutors  and  other  law enforcement  officials  have  echoed  these  views.  The \nformer  President  of the  Police  Foundation has  asserted  that,  rather than treating  persons  with \nfelony  convictions  as  a  “pariah  class,”  we  need  to  bring  people  back  as  whole  citizens”  in  order \nto  have  “effective  policing.”  Wood,  Restoring  the  Right  to  Vote  at  10.  The  former  President  of \nthe  Police  Executive  Research  Forum  has  asserted  that  it  is  “better to  remove  any  obstacles  that \nstand  in the  way  of offenders  resuming  a full,  healthy,  productive  life.”  Jd.  And  a  former \nprosecutor  from Kentucky  has  added  that  “we  spend  millions  to  rehabilitate  offenders  and  bring \nthem  back  into  society  only  to  let  an  outdated  system push them  back  with one  hand while  we \npull  with the  other.”  R.  David  Stengel,  Let’s Simplify  the  Process for Disenfranchised  Voters, \nCent.  Ky.  News-J  (Jan.  28,  2007).° \n70.  |  The  General  Assembly’s  unconstitutional  and  arbitrary  voting  restrictions  thus \npose  a  significant  barrier to  individuals  with past  felony  convictions  seeking  to  reintegrate  and \nbe  productive  and  contributing  members  of society.  These  restrictions  are  plainly  at odds  with \nthe  missions  of CSI,  Justice  Served,  and  the North  Carolina NAACP  and  force  these \norganizational  plaintiffs  to  divert  resources  toward voter  education  efforts  about these \nrestrictions  and  away  from  other programming  that helps  individuals  transition back to  and \nparticipate  fully  in  society. \n71.  Eliminating  voting  restrictions  on North  Carolinians  with  felony  convictions \nliving  in  community  will  also  reduce  inaccurate  voter  purges.  North  Carolina removes \napproximately  10,000  citizens  from  its  voter  rolls  each  year  due  to  felony  convictions.  See \nMelissa Boughton:  Monday Numbers:  Who  has  been  removed from  NC’s  voter  rolls?,  N.C. \nPolicy  Watch  (Aug.  19,  2019)  (8,574  registered voters  with  felony  convictions  removed  from the \n  \n6 https://bit.ly/2Kia8Ea. \n23\nNorth  Carolina rolls  in  2018;  9,150  in 2017).  But these purges  are  often  inaccurate,  as  the  State \nBoard  of Elections  frequently  misclassifies  voters  and  inaccurately  removes  voters  from  the  rolls \nin  reliance  on its  rules  prohibiting  people  from  voting  due  to  a prior  felony  conviction,  even  after \ntheir  release  from  incarceration.  See,  e.g.,  Proposed  Findings  of Fact  &  Conclusions  of Law  § \n214,  League  of Women  Voters  v.  North  Carolina,  997  F.  Supp.  2d  322  (M.D.N.C.  Aug.  17,  2015) \n(sworn  testimony  asserting  that  voters  have  been  “incorrectly  identified  as  having  been  convicted \nof a felony  and  purged  from  [the]  voter  roll”). \nCLAIMS  FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT  ONE \nViolation  of North  Carolina’s  Free  Elections  Clause,  Art.  I,  §  10 \n72.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  all  other paragraphs  as  if fully  set  forth herein. \n73.  Article  I,  Section  10  of the North  Carolina  Constitution,  which has  no  counterpart \nin the  U.S.  Constitution,  provides  that  “ATI  elections  shall  be  free.” \n74.  North  Carolina’s  Free  Elections  Clause  traces  its  roots  to  the  1689  English  Bill  of \nRights,  which  declared  that  “Elections  of members  of Parliament  ought  to  be  free.”  Bill  of \nRights  1689,  1  W.  &  M.  c.2  (Eng.);  see  John  V.  Orth,  North  Carolina  Constitutional History,  70 \nN.C.  L.  Rev.  1759,  1797-98  (1992). \n75.  This  provision  in the  English  Bill  of Rights responded  to  efforts  by the  king to \nmanipulate  parliamentary  elections  by  manipulating  the  composition  of the  electorate.  J.R. \nJones,  The  Revolution  of 1688  in England 148  (1972).  The  king  could modify  voter  eligibility \nrules  by  issuing  municipal  charters,  and  in  some  areas he  would  issue  new  charters to  shrink the \nelectorate  to  help  his  allies,  while  in  others,  he  expanded  the  electorate  to  ensure  his  opponents \nwould  lose.  See  George  H.  Jones,  Convergent Forces:  Immediate  Causes  of the  Revolution  of \n1688  in England 75-78  (1990).  The  king thus  manipulated  the  electorate  in  different  areas \n24\n“based  on  the  detailed  suggestions  of the  [king’s]  agents  as  to  what  specific  local  rights  could, \nwith  electoral  advantage,  be  confirmed  or  extended.”  J.R.  Jones,  The  Revolution  of 1688  in \nEngland  148  (1972).  The  king’s  efforts  to  manipulate  elections  led to  a revolution.  After \ndethroning  the  king,  the  revolutionaries  called  for a  “free  and  lawful  parliament”  as a  critical \nreform,  and they  enacted  the  free  elections  clause.  Grey  S.  De  Krey,  Restoration  and Revolution \nin  Britain:  A  Political History  of the  Era  of Charles II and the  Glorious  Revolution  241,  247-48, \n250  (2007). \n76.  | Numerous  states  in  addition to  North  Carolina have  free  elections  clauses  that \ntrace  their roots  to  the  English  Bill  of Rights.  For  instance,  Pennsylvania  adopted  its  version  of \nfree  elections  clause  in  1776.  See  League  of Women  Voters  v.  Commonwealth,  178  A.3d  737, \n806-07  (Pa.  2018).  As  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court  has  explained,  Pennsylvania’s  free \nelections  provision  reflected  “a  desire  to  secure  access  to  the  election  process  by  all  people  with \nan  interest  in  the  communities  in which they  lived—universal  suffrage—by  prohibiting  exclusion \nfrom  the  election process  of those  without  property  or financial  means.”  /d.  at  807.  “It,  thus, \nestablished a  critical  leveling  protection  in  an effort  to  establish the  uniform right  of the  people  .  . \n.  to  select their representatives  in  government,”  and  “sought  to  ensure  that this  right  of the  people \nwould  forever remain  equal  no  matter their  financial  situation  or  social  class.”  Jd. \n77.  North  Carolina  adopted  its  Free  Elections  Clause  in  1776,  the  same  year  as \nPennsylvania,  and North  Carolina  has  strengthened  its  Free  Elections  Clause  since  to  reinforce \nits  principal  purpose  of preserving  the  popular  sovereignty  of North  Carolinians.  The  original \nclause,  adopted  in  1776,  provided that  “elections  of members,  to  serve  as  Representatives  in the \nGeneral  Assembly,  ought  to  be  free.”  N.C.  Declaration  of Rights,  VI  (1776).  The North \nCarolina  Constitution  of  1868  adopted  after  the  Civil  War,  which  initially  expanded the  political \n25\nrights  of African Americans,  included a  revised  Free  Elections  Clause  stating  that  “[a]//  elections \nought  to  be  free.”  N.C.  Const.  art.  1,  §  10  (1868).  And  when North  Carolina  adopted  its  current \nconstitution  in  1971,  it revised  the  provision  again to  state  that  “{a]ll  elections  shall  be  free.” \nN.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  10.  This  change  was  intended to  “make  [it]  clear”  that the  Free  Elections \nClause  and  the  other  rights  secured  to  the  people  by  the  Declaration  of Rights  “are  commands \nand not  mere  admonitions”  to  proper  conduct  on  the  part  of the  government.  N.C.  State  Bar  v. \nDuMont,  304  N.C.  627,  635,  639,  286  S.E.2d  89,  97  (1982)  (internal  quotations  omitted). \n78.  In  light  of the  text  and  history  of this  provision,  a North  Carolina  court recently \nheld that  “the  meaning  of the  Free Elections  Clause  is  that  elections  must  be  conducted freely \nand  honestly  to  ascertain,  fairly  and  truthfully,  the will  of the  people.  This  .  .  .  is  a  fundamental \nright  of the  citizens  enshrined  in  our  Constitution’s  Declaration  of Rights,  a  compelling \ngovernmental  interest,  and  a  cornerstone  of our  democratic  form  of government.”  Common \nCause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *110. \n79.  Citing  the  Free  Elections  Clause,  the  North  Carolina  Supreme  Court  similarly  has \nexplained that  “[t]he  right to  vote  is  one  of the  most  cherished  rights  in  our  system  of \ngovernment.”  Blankenship  v.  Bartlett,  363  N.C.  518  (2009)  (citing N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  Sec.  10). \n“No  right  is  more  precious  in  a free  country  than that  of having  a voice  in the  election of those \nwho  make  the  laws  under which,  as  good  citizens,  we  must  live.”  Jd.  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted)). \n80.  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute,  which  indiscriminately  denies \nthe  right to  vote  to  all people  with felony  convictions  even  after  their  release,  until  they  receive \nan  “unconditional  discharge[]”  from probation  or  parole,  facially  violates  the  Free  Elections \nClause.  Just  like  the  King  of England’s  efforts  to  influence  elections  by  manipulating the \n26\neligible  electorate,  North  Carolina’s  statutory  scheme  prolonging  disenfranchisement  through \nprobation  or parole,  restricts  North  Carolina’s  electorate. \n81.  In  so  doing,  North Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  violates  the  Free \nElection  Clause’s  guarantee  that  elections  in North  Carolina must  “honestly  .  .  .  ascertain,  fairly \nand  truthfully,  the  will  of the  people.”  Common  Cause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *2.  The  statute \ndenies  the  right  to  vote  to  roughly  70,000 North  Carolina voting-age  citizens  who  are  currently \nliving  in North  Carolina communities  on  some  form  of probation  or  post-release  supervision. \nParticularly  given the razor-thin  margins  of many  North  Carolina  elections,  the \ndisenfranchisement  statute  prevents  the  “will  of the  people—the  majority”  from prevailing.  Jd. \nat  300  (emphasis  added)  (quoting  State  ex  rel.  Quinn  v.  Lattimore,  120  N.C.  426,  428,  26  S.E. \n638,  638  (1897)). \n82.  The  disenfranchisement  statute’s  requirement that people  released  from \nincarceration  pay  all  financial  obligations  before  regaining  the  right to  vote  is  an  especially \npernicious  violation  of the  Free  Elections  Clause.  Elections  in North  Carolina  are  not  free  when \nvoting  is  conditioned  on  some  people’s  ability  to  make  financial  payments. \n83.  Although the  North  Carolina  Constitution  authorizes  the  General  Assembly  to \nregulate rights  restoration  for people  with felony  convictions,  the  General  Assembly’s  rights \nrestoration  statutes  must  comply  with North  Carolina  law,  including  other provisions  of the \nNorth Carolina  Constitution.  By  continuing  disenfranchisement through  probation  or parole,  the \nGeneral  Assembly’s  scheme  violates  the  Free  Elections  Clause. \nCOUNT  TWO \nViolation  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution’s \nEqual  Protection  Clause,  Art.  I,  §  19 \n84.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  all  other paragraphs  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \n27\n85.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the North  Carolina Constitution  guarantees  to  all \nNorth  Carolinians  that  “[n]o  person  shall  be  denied the  equal  protection  of the  laws.”  N.C. \nConst.,  art.  I,  §  19. \n86.  This provision provides  for  greater protections  than  its  federal  counterpart.  In \nparticular,  North  Carolina’s  Equal Protection  Clause  protects  the  right to  “substantially  equal \nvoting  power.”  Stephenson,  355  N.C.  at  379.  “It  is  well  settled  in  this  State  that the  right to  vote \non  equal  terms  is  a  fundamental  right.”  /d.  at  378  (emphasis  added). \n87.  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  violates  the  Equal  Protection \nClause  in three  distinct ways. \n88.  First,  the  statute  deprives  all  people with past felony  convictions  subject to \nprobation  or parole  of “substantially  equal  voting power”—indeed,  of any  “voting  power”  at  all. \n89.  Second,  the  statute  has  the  intent  and  effect  of discriminating  against  African \nAmericans.  The  continued  disenfranchisement  of people  with  felony  convictions  through \nprobation  or parole,  even  after  their release,  disproportionately  impacts  African  Americans  and \ndeprives  the  African  American  community  of “substantially  equal  voting  power.” \n90.  Third,  in  conditioning  the  right to  vote  on the  ability  to  make  financial  payments, \nthe  statute  creates  an  impermissible  class-based  classification. \n91.  Strict  scrutiny  applies  to  each  of these  classifications.  Defendants  cannot  provide \nany  legitimate  government  interest—let alone  a  compelling  government  interest—in  denying  the \nright  to  vote  to  all  people  with  felony  convictions  until  they  are  discharged  from  probation  or \nparole.  There  is  no  legitimate justification  for  denying  the  right  to  vote  to  upwards  of 70,000 \ncitizens  who  are  living  amongst  society  and  whose  lives  will  be  governed  by the  laws  enacted \nand  enforced  by  elected  officials.  Nor  is North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute \n28\nnarrowly  tailored to  any  conceivable  government  interest.  The  statute  indiscriminately \ndisenfranchises  all  people  with  felony  convictions  until  they  complete probation  or  parole. \n92.  Although  the  North  Carolina  Constitution  authorizes  the  General  Assembly  to \nregulate  rights  restoration  for people  with  felony  convictions,  the  General  Assembly’s  rights \nrestoration  statutes  must  comply  with North  Carolina  law,  including  other provisions  of the \nNorth  Carolina  Constitution.  By  continuing  disenfranchisement  through probation  or parole, \neven beyond  releasee  the  General  Assembly’s  scheme  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause. \nCOUNT  THREE \nViolation  of North  Carolina  Constitution’s \nFreedom  of Speech  and  Assembly  Clauses,  Art.  I,  §§  12  &  14 \n93.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  all  other paragraphs  as  if fully  set  forth herein. \n94.  Article  I,  Section  12  of the North  Carolina  Constitution provides  that  “[t]he \npeople  have a  right to  assemble  together  to  consult  for their  common  good,  to  instruct  their \nrepresentatives,  and  to  apply  to  the  General  Assembly  for  redress  of grievances.” \n95.  Article  I,  Section  14  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution provides  that  “[f]reedom \nof speech  and  of the  press  are  two  of the  great bulwarks  of liberty  and  therefore  shall  never be \nrestrained.” \n96.  —  These  provisions  provide  broader rights  than  do  their  counterparts  in the  U.S. \nconstitution.  Common  Cause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *118. \n97.   “[V]oting  for  the  candidate  of one’s  choice  and  associating  with  the  political  party \nof one’s  choice  are  core  means  of political  expression  protected  by the  North  Carolina \nConstitution’s  Freedom  of Speech  and  Freedom  of Assembly  Clauses.”  /d.  at  119.  “Voting \nprovides  citizens  a  direct  means  of expressing  support  for  a  candidate  and his  views.”  Jd. \n98.  North  Carolina’s  disenfranchisement  statute  constitutes  an  outright ban  on  “core \n...  political  expression.”  Jd.  The  statute  denies  tens  of thousands  of North  Carolina  citizens  of \n29\nthe  most  “direct  means”  that  exists  of “expressing  support  for  a candidate  and  his  views.”  Id. \nThe  statute  is  no  different  from  a law that  prevents  people  with felony  convictions  from  giving  a \nspeech  about  matters  of public  importance  in the  town  square. \n99.  _ Because  the  disenfranchisement  statute  prohibits  protected  expression  and \nassociation  for  people  released  from  incarceration,  strict  scrutiny  applies.  Defendants  cannot \nprovide  any  legitimate  government  interest—let  alone  any  compelling  government  interest—in \ndenying  people  the  right  to  vote  until  they  complete  probation  or  parole.  There  is  no  legitimate \njustification  for  denying the  right to  vote  of 70,000  citizens  who  are  living  amongst  society  and \nwhose  lives  will  be  governed  by  the  laws  enacted  and  enforced  by  elected  officials.  Nor  is  North \nCarolina’s  disenfranchisement  statute  narrowly  tailored to  any  conceivable  government  interest. \nThe  statute  indiscriminately  disenfranchises  all  people  with felony  convictions  until they \ncomplete  probation  or  parole. \n100.  Although the  North  Carolina  Constitution  authorizes  the  General  Assembly  to \nregulate  rights  restoration for people  with felony  convictions,  the  General  Assembly’s  rights \nrestoration  statutes  must  comply  with North  Carolina law,  including  other provisions  of the \nNorth  Carolina  Constitution.  By  continuing  disenfranchisement through  probation,  parole,  or \npost-release  supervision,  beyond  release,  the  General  Assembly’s  scheme  violates  the  Freedom \nof Speech  and  Assembly  Clauses. \nCOUNT  FOUR \nViolation  of North  Carolina  Constitution’s \nBan  on  Property  Qualifications,  Art.  I,  §  11 \n101.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  all  other paragraphs  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \n102.  Article  I,  Section  11  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution  provides  that “[a]s \npolitical  rights  and privileges  are  not  dependent  upon  or  modified  by property,  no  property \nqualification  shall  affect the  right  to  vote  or  hold  office.” \n30\n103.  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  violates  this  provision  by \nconditioning  the  right  to  vote  on whether  people  have  a type  of property—money.  E.g.,  Reiter  v. \nSonotone  Corp.,  442  U.S.  330,  338  (1979)  (“Money,  of course,  is  a  form  of property.”).  The \nstatute  conditions  the  right to  vote  on  a person’s  ability  to  pay  court costs  and  fees.  It provides \nthat  a person  convicted  of a felony  shall  have  their  citizenship  rights  restored  only  upon their \n“unconditional  discharge”  from probation.  N.C.G.S.  §  13-1(1).  If the  person  fails  to  “[p]ay  the \ncosts  of court,  any  fine  ordered by  the  court,  and  make  restitution  or reparation,”  N.C.G.S.  § \n15A-1343(b)(9),  he  or  she  has  committed  a  “violation  of a  condition  of probation”  that \nauthorizes  the  court  to  extend  the  term  of probation—and thus  the  denial  of the  right to  vote—to \nas  much  as  five  years.  N.C.G.S.  §§  15A-1342(a),  15A-1344(a),  (d).  North  Carolinians  who \nhave  otherwise  completed the  terms  of their probation are  routinely  subjected to  extended \nprobation—and  thus  extended  disenfranchisement—for  failing  to  pay  court fees.  Indeed,  while \nprobation may  not be  revoked  based  on  nonpayment  of costs  when poverty  prevents  that person \nfrom  paying the  costs,  State  v.  Robinson,  248  N.C.  282,  103  S.E.2d  376  (1958),  the  inability  to \npay  provides  no  relief from the  continuation  or  extension  of probation.  An  individual  on \nprobation must  pay  these  financial  obligations  in  order  regain the  right  to  vote,  rendering  these \nobligations  the  functional  equivalent  of a poll tax. \n104.  Because North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  makes  re- \nenfranchisement  “dependent”  on  whether  an  individual  has  sufficient  money  to  pay  court  costs, \nfees,  and  restitution,  the  statute  violates  the  ban  on property  qualifications  set  forth in Article  I,  § \n11  of the North Carolina Constitution. \n31\nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request that  this  Honorable  Court  enter judgment \nin  their favor  and  against  Defendants,  and; \nDeclare  that N.C.G.S.  §  13-1’s  disenfranchisement  of individuals  while  on \na. \nprobation,  parole,  or  suspended  sentence  is  facially  unconstitutional  and  invalid \nunder  the  North  Carolina’s  Constitution’s  Free  Elections  Clause,  Art.  I,  §  10; \nEqual  Protection  Clause,  Art.  I,  §  19;  the  Freedom  of Speech  and  Freedom  of \nAssembly  Clauses,  Art.  I,  §§  12  &  14;  and  the  Ban  on  Property  Qualifications, \nArt.  I,  §  11. \nEnjoin  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  from  preventing North \nCarolina  citizens  released  from  incarceration  or not  sentenced  to  incarceration \nfrom registering  to  vote  and  exercising the  right to  vote  based  on  their  felony \nconviction. \nEnjoin  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  from  conditioning \nrestoration  of the  right to  vote  on payment  of any  financial  obligation. \nRequire  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  to  notify  all  people \nwith  past  felony  convictions  who  have  already  been  released  from  incarceration \nor  are  released  from  incarceration  in the  future  that their right to  vote  was  restored \nupon release  from  incarceration  or  upon not  being placed  under  community \nsupervision  and  that they  may  lawfully  register  to  vote  and  vote  in North  Carolina \nelections. \nRequire  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  to  engage  in  and  take \nsuch  additional  steps  as  this  Court  deems just  and  appropriate  to  ensure  that \n32\naffected  citizens  are  informed  of their  restored rights  and  are  able  to  register to \nvote  and  vote  in North  Carolina  elections. \nf.

In  support  thereof,  Plaintiffs  state  as  follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs  filed  the  Complaint  in this  action  on November  20th,  2019,  challenging \nNorth  Carolina’s  statutory  scheme  for  disenfranshising  people  formerly  convicted  of felonies \n(“returning  citizens”),  N.C.  Gen.  Stat.  §  13-1,  because  it  violates  the  North  Carolina \nConstitution’s  Free  Elections  Clause,  Equal  Protection  Clause,  Freedom  of Speech  and \nAssembly  Clauses,  and  the  Ban  on  Property  Qualifications.  Defendants  are  the  Speaker  of the \nstate  House  and  the  President  Pro  Tempore  of the  state  Senate  (together,  “Legislative \nDefendants”),  and  the  State  Board  of Elections  and  its  members  (collectively,  “State  Board \nDefendants”). \n2.  Plaintiffs  file  this  Motion to  Expedite  the  case  schedule  in  conjunction with  their \nComplaint. \n3.  In  order to  enable  relief before the November  2020  elections,  it  is  in  the \noverwhelming  interest  of the  parties  and  the  public  to  resolve  this  case  as  expeditiously  as \npossible.  Based  on  recent  estimates,  if Plaintiffs  were  to  prevail  in this  case,  approximately \n70,000  North  Carolina residents  who  are  currently  disenfranchised  would  regain their  right  to \nvote.  See,  e.g.,  Southern  Coalition  for  Social  Justice,  The  Freedom  to  Vote  Felony \nDisenfranchisement  in North  Carolina  (Aug.  2019),  available  at https://bit.ly/3  1 WFtQI.  Many \nof these  individuals  have  been  disenfranchised  for years  following  their  release  from \nincarceratation,  even though  they  are  law-abiding  members  of their  communities  and their lives \n2\nare  governed  by  the  laws  passed  by  elected  officials.  “The  right to  vote  is  one  of the  most \ncherished  rights  in our  system  of government.”  Blankenship  v.  Bartlett,  363  N.C.  518  (2009) \n(citing  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  Sec.  10).  “No  right  is  more  precious  in  a  free  country  than that  of \nhaving  a voice  in the  election  of those  who  make  the  laws  under  which,  as  good  citizens,  we \nmust live.”  Jd.  (internal  quotation marks  omitted).  Accordingly,  an  expedited  case  schedule  is \nnecessary  to  ensure  that,  if Plaintiffs  prevail  on  the  merits,  Plaintiffs  and  tens  of thousands  of \nother North  Carolinians  do  not risk  suffering  through  another  election  in which  they  are  denied \ntheir  fundamental  right to  vote. \n4.  Moreover,  an  expedited  case  schedule  is  needed  so  that,  if Plaintiffs  prevail,  there \nis  sufficient  time before  the November  2020  election  to  reach  out  to  affected  communities, \neducate them  on the  changes  in the  law,  and  allow them  time to  register to  vote.  Individuals  re- \nentering  society  following  their  incarceration  are  often  difficult  to  reach  and  alerting  these \nindividuals  on  any  newly  obtained  right to  vote  may  be  especially  difficult  given  that there  have \nbeen  high-profile  criminal  prosecutions  in North  Carolina  of people  formerly  convicted  of felony \nviolations  who  voted  while  on  probation.  See  Lynn Bonner,  Felony  charges  of illegal voting \ndismissed for five  NC residents,  News  &  Observer,  Aug.  14,  2018,  https://bit.ly/322babK. \n5.  An  expedited  case  schedule  is  also  in  the  interests  of the  State  Board  Defendants. \nThe  State  Board  Defendants,  as  well  as  local  boards  of elections,  will  benefit  from  having  as \nmuch  time  as  possible  to  process  voter  registrations  from Plaintiffs  and  other  individuals  who \nregain their  right to  vote  if Plaintiffs prevail.\n6.  To  promote a  timely  resolution  of this  case,  Plaintiffs  have  effectuated prompt \nservice  on  Defendants  and  will  in  short  order  serve  written  discovery  requests.  Plaintiffs  now \npropose  the  following  deadlines  and  procedures  relating  to  pleadings,  procedures,  discovery, \nmotions  practice,  and trial  if necessary: \ne  All  pleadings,  motions,  briefs,  discovery  requests,  and  discovery  responses  shall  be \nserved  by  e-mail.  Depositions  may  be  taken upon  i0  days’  notice. \ne  Defendants  shall  file  any  motion(s)  to  dismiss  and brief(s)  in  support no  later than \nDecember  13,  2019.  Plaintiffs  shall  file  any  opposition  to  any motion(s)  to  dismiss \nno  later  than December  23,  2019,  and  Defendants  shall  file  any  reply(ies)  no  later \nthan  January  6,  2020.' \ne  All  written  fact  discovery  shall  be  completed  no  later  than  January  10,  2020.  The \nparties  by  agreement may  continue  document  or  written  discovery  beyond  this \ndeadline,  but  the  Court will  not  intervene  in this  voluntary  process  except  in \nextraordinary  circumstances,  and  the  date  on which  summary judgment motions  are \ndue  will  not be  modified  because  of information obtained  through this  voluntary \nprocess. \ne  Expert reports  shall  be  served  no  later  than  January  21,  2020.  Those  reports  shall \ninclude  the  information  stated  in  Rule  26(b)(4)(A)(2)  of the  North  Carolina  Rules  of \nCivil  Procedure.  Rebuttal  expert  reports  shall  be  served  no  later than  February  7, \n2020.  Reply  expert reports  shall  be  served no  later  than  February  18,  2020. \ne  All  fact  depositions  and  fact  discovery  shall  be  completed  by  January  31,  2020. \ne  Expert  depositions  shall  be  completed by  February  25,  2020,  which  shall  be  the  same \nday  that  all  discovery  shall  be  completed. \ne  Plaintiffs  anticipate  that  this  case  will  be  appropriate  for resolution  on  summary \njudgment.  Any  summary judgment  motion(s)  shall  be  due  on  March  6,  2020.  Any \nopposition  to  summary judgment  motion(s)  shall  be  due  on  March  20,  2020,  and  any \nreply(ies)  shall  be  due  on  March  27,  2020. \n  \n'  Plaintiffs propose this  extended window of time for Defendants to  file any reply(ies) to accommodate for the \nholidays. \n4\ne  Should  the  Court  determine  that this  case  is  not  appropriate  for resolution  on \nsummary judgment,  trial  shall  commence,  subject  to  the  court’s  availability,  on  April \n20,  2020. \n7.  Plaintiffs’  proposed  schedule  will  allow  adequate  time  for this  Court to  enter \njudgment  and  for  any  appellate  review  before  the November  2020  general  elections.  The \nschedule  proposed  above  is  also  reasonable  given that  there  should  be  minimal  fact  and  expert \ndiscovery  in  this  case.  There  is  no  need  for this  case  to  have  a  drawn-out  schedule,  and  the \npublic  interest  overwhelmingly  favors  an expeditious resolution  of this  matter. \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  request  that  the  Court  enter  an  order providing  for the \nexpedited  case  schedule  set  out  above.\nRespectfully  submitted  this the  20th  day  of November,  2019. \nFORWARD  JUSTICE  en  ARNOLD  &  PORTER \n;  Co  »  KAYE  SCHOLER LLP \n Whete  u.

The  right  to  vote  is  a \nfundamental  right  in  this  state,  and,  like  all  fundamental  rights,  it  may  not  be  abridged  absent  a \ncompelling  government  interest.  Yet,  with  no  legitimate  government  interest,  state  law  denies \nthe  right to  vote  to  tens  of thousands  of people  living  in North  Carolina  communities  because \nthey  have a  prior  felony  conviction.  These  individuals  are  prohibited  from  voting  until  they  are \n“unconditionally  discharged”  from  probation,  parole,  post-release  supervision  or  a  suspended \nsentence—often years  after  their  release  from  incarceration  and  reentry  into  society.  In  many \ncases,  the  disenfranchisement  persists  solely  because  of a person’s  inability  to  pay  court  costs, \nfees,  or  restitution.  In  some  instances,  North  Carolinians  convicted  of felonies  are  placed  under \ncommunity  supervision  sentences  by  the  court  without  incarceration;  while  they  are \neconomically  contributing  to  society,  North  Carolina  law  bars  them  from  voting  for  the  entirety \nof their probationary  period.  These  North  Carolinians  are  neighbors,  co-workers,  family \nmembers,  taxpayers,  and  participants  in  civic  groups.  The  same  as  all  other  citizens,  their  lives \nare  governed  by  the  laws  enacted  and  enforced  by  elected  officials.  But  unlike  their  neighbors, \nthey  are  denied  the  fundamental  right  to  participate  in  choosing  their  representatives.  North \nCarolina’s  disenfranchisement  of citizens  living  in  our  community  based  solely  on  a prior  felony \nconviction  (“probation  and  post-release  felony  disenfranchisement”)  serves  no  legitimate \ngovernment  purpose.  It  is  unfair,  discriminatory,  and  wrong.  And  it  violates  the North  Carolina \nConstitution. \nUS  167134072v2\nDe  The  impact  of this  disenfranchisement  scheme  is  staggering.  According  to  a \nrecent  estimate,  roughly  70,000  North  Carolinians  are  unable  to  vote  today  because  of a  felony \nconviction,  even  though  they  have  been  released  from  incarceration  (or  were  never  incarcerated) \nand  are  living  in  communities  across  the  state.  And  by  wide  margins,  this  scheme \ndisproportionately  harms  African  Americans,  who  represent  about  20%  of North  Carolina’s \nvoting  population  but  40%  of those  disenfranchised  while  on  probation,  parole,  or  a  suspended \nsentence.  The  impact  on  African-American  men  is  even  more  disparate. \nBy  While  the  North  Carolina  Constitution  provides  that the  “manner”  of rights \nrestoration  shall  be  “prescribed  by  law,”  N.C.  Const.,  Art.  VI,  §  2,  cl.  3,  the  General  Assembly  of \ncourse  must  exercise  this  authority  consistent  with  other  constitutional  limitations. \n4.  One  such  limitation  is  the  North  Carolina  Constitution’s  command  that  “all \nelections  shall  be  free”—a provision  specifically  intended  to  prohibit  government  manipulation \nof the  electorate.  Probation  and  post-release  felony  disenfranchisement  perniciously  restricts  the \neligible  electorate  in North  Carolina.  The  felony-based  disenfranchisement  law  strikes  at  the \nheart  of the  Free  Elections  Clause’s  guarantee  that  elections  in  North  Carolina  must  “freely  and \nhonestly  ...  ascertain  .  .  .  the  will  of the  people.”  Common  Cause  v Lewis,  No.  18  CVS  014001, \n2019  WL  4569584,  at  *109-12  (N.C.  Super.  Sep.  03,  2019). \n5.  North  Carolina’s  Equal  Protection  Clause,  which  affords  broader  protections  than \nits  federal  counterpart,  protects  “the  fundamental  right  of each  North  Carolinian  to  substantially \nequal  voting  power.”  Stephenson  v.  Bartlett,  355  N.C.  354,  379,  562  S.E.2d  377,  394  (N.C. \n2002).  North  Carolina’s  probation  and  post-release  felony  disenfranchisement  scheme  deprives \nall  people  subject  to  probation,  parole  and  post-release  supervision  of “substantially  equal  voting \npower,”  and  particularly  discriminates  against  African  Americans  in  intent  and  effect. \nUS  167134072v2\n6.  This  State’s  free  speech  and  assembly  guarantees  likewise  provide  broader \nprotections  than  their  federal  counterparts,  and  “[v]oting  for the  candidate  of one’s  choice”  is  a \n“core  means  of political  expression  protected  by  the  North  Carolina  Constitution’s  Freedom  of \nSpeech  and  Freedom  of Assembly  Clauses.”  Common  Cause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *119. \nProbation  and  post-release  disenfranchisement  constitutes  an  outright  ban  on  such  political \nexpression. \nde  Lastly,  the  requirement  that  people  pay  money  to  regain  access  to  the  franchise \nviolates  the  North  Carolina  Constitution’s  Ban  on  Property  Qualifications. \n8.  This  Court  should  declare  that North  Carolina’s  probation  and  post-release  felony \ndisenfranchisement  law  violates  the  North  Carolina  Constitution,  and  enjoin  Defendants  from \ndenying  the  fundamental  right to  vote  to  people  previously  convicted  of a  felony  who  are  living \nin  society. \nPARTIES \n9.

CSI  provides  small  group  trainings  and  individual  mentoring  in \ngeneral  life  skills,  civic  engagement,  leadership,  entrepreneurship,  and  financial  literacy. \nThrough  these  training  and  mentorship  sessions,  CSI  diverts  time  and  resources  away  from  its \nother  work  to  educate  people,  including  people  disenfranchised  under N.C.G.S.  §  13-1,  about \n3 \nUS  167134072v2\ntheir  voting  rights  (or  lack  thereof),  and  assists  them  in  registering  to  vote  (in  accordance  with \ncurrent North  Carolina  law).

The  North  Carolina NAACP  has \nmembers  who  are  citizens  but,  under N.C.G.S.A.  §  13-1,  are  unable  to  vote  due  to  a prior  felony \nconviction  despite  having  been  released  from  incarceration.  The  fundamental  mission  of the \nNorth  Carolina NAACP  is  the  advancement  and  improvement  of the  political,  civil,  educational, \nsocial,  and  economic  status  of minority  groups;  the  elimination  of racial  prejudice;  the \npublicizing  of adverse  effects  of racial  discrimination;  and  the  initiation  of lawful  action  to \nsecure  the  elimination  of racial  bias.  In  furtherance  of this  mission,  the  North  Carolina NAACP \nadvocates  to  ensure  that  the  interests  of the  African  American  community  and  people  of color  are \nrepresented  on  the  local,  state,  and  national  legislative  bodies  by  representatives  who  share  the \ncommunity’s  interests,  values,  and  beliefs,  and  who  will  be  accountable  to  the  community.  The \nNorth  Carolina NAACP  thus  encourages  and  facilitates  nonpartisan  voter  registration  drives  by \nits  chapters  to  promote  civic  participation.  The  North  Carolina NAACP  is  currently  forced  to \ndivert  organizational  resources  away  from  activities  core  to  its  mission  in  furtherance  of \neducation  and  voter  engagement  efforts  required  to  assist potential  voters  in  North  Carolina  in \nunderstanding  North  Carolina’s  felony-based  disenfranchisement  laws. \n13.  Plaintiff Timothy  Locklear  is  a  57-year-old  member  of the  Lumbee  Tribe  from \nLumberton,  North  Carolina.  He  was  convicted  of a  felony  offense  in  2018,  and  after  serving  10 \nmonths  of incarceration,  he  was  released  on  October  11,  2019.  Mr.  Locklear  is  currently  on \npost-release  supervision  for  a term  of at  least  nine  months.  He  currently  resides  at  Leading  Into \nUS  167134072v2\nNew  Communities  (“LINC”)  in  Wilmington,  NC,  where  he  is  enrolled  in  a  90-day  post-release \nprogram.  As  part  of this  program,  Mr.  Locklear regularly  attends  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA) \nand  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  Mr.  Locklear  works  full-time  at  the  New  Hanover \nCounty  Landfill.  Mr.  Locklear  believes  that  every  voice  is  supposed  to  count  in the  political \nprocess.  Mr.  Locklear  would  vote  in  upcoming  North  Carolina  elections  but  for  his \ndisenfranchisement. \n14.  __ Plaintiff Drakarus  Jones  is  a  26-year-old  African  American  man  from \nGreenwood,  Mississippi.  In  2017,  Mr.  Jones  moved  to  North  Carolina  for  a  fresh  start,  but  found \nhimself entangled  in  the  criminal justice  system.  He  was  convicted  of a  felony  in  Onslow \nCounty,  North  Carolina  for which  he  was  incarcerated  for two  years.  He  was  released  on  August \n15,  2019  and  is  now  on  post-release  supervision  until  April  2020.  He  is  currently  pursuing  an \nelectrical  line  working  certification  from  Cape  Fear  Community  College.  Mr.  Jones  was  recently \nemployed  as  a  construction  worker  in  Wilmington,  North  Carolina,  but  was  let  go  after  his \nemployer  conducted  a  criminal  background  check.  He  is  actively  seeking  new  employment.  Mr. \nJones  went  to  the  polls  to  vote  in  the  2019  election,  but  was  told  by  a poll  worker  that  he  was \nunable  to  vote  due  to  his  criminal  history.  Mr.  Jones  believes  that  by  being  released  from  prison \nto  contribute  as  a productive  member  of society,  pay  taxes,  and  all  of the  many  privileges  of free \ncitizens,  he  should  be  allowed  to  voice  his  opinion  through  voting.  Mr.  Jones  would  vote  in \nupcoming  North  Carolina  elections  but  for  his  disenfranchisement. \n15.  Plaintiff Susan  Marion  is  a  54-year-old  white  woman  from  Jamestown,  North \nCarolina.

She  was  released  on  November  19,  2019  and  was  placed  on  post-release \nsupervision  for  a  term  of at  least  nine  months.  Ms.  Marion  currently  resides  at  LINC  in \nUS  167134072v2\nWilmington,  North  Carolina.  Ms.  Marion  received  an  accounting  degree  from  North  Carolina \nAgricultural  &  Technical  State  University  in  1997,  and  is  planning  to  seek  employment  in \naccounting  after  completing  her  time  at  LINC.  Ms.  Marion  has  been a  registered,  active  voter  in \nthe  past  until  she  was  disenfranchised  due  to  her  felony  conviction.  Ms.  Marion  believes  her \ncurrent  disenfranchisement  prevents  her  voice  from  being  heard.  Ms.  Marion  would  vote  in \nupcoming  North  Carolina  elections  but  for  her  disenfranchisement. \n16.  Plaintiff Henry  Harrison  is  a  51-year-old  African  American  man  originally  from \nNewark,  New  Jersey.  Mr.  Harrison  was  convicted  of a  felony  in  January  2019  in New  Hanover \nCounty.  After  serving  nine  months  in  prison,  Mr.  Harrison  was  released  on  July  15,  2019.

Felony  Disenfranchisement  Has  Long  Been  Used  in  North  Carolina  to \nSuppress  the  Political  Power  of African  Americans \n30.  North  Carolina has  stripped  the  right to  vote  from  persons  convicted  of certain \ncrimes  since  the  enactment  of its  first  state  constitution  in  1776.  But  the  state  began  to  broadly \ndisenfranchise  all  persons  with  felony  convictions  after  the  Civil  War  as  a  means  of suppressing \nthe  political  power  of African  Americans. \nale  Before  the  Civil  War,  election  officials  in North  Carolina  excluded  only \n“infamous”  persons  from  suffrage.  The  disenfranchisement  of infamous  persons  is  rooted  in \nEnglish  common  law.  Infamy  “could  result  either  from  the  commission  of an  infamous  crime,” \nsuch  as  treason,  bribery,  or perjury,  “or  from  the  receipt  of an  infamous  punishment  such  as \nwhipping,”  which  could  be  inflicted  for  certain  other  crimes,  like  petty  larceny.  See  Pippa \nUS  167134072v2\nHolloway,  Living  in  Infamy:  Felon  Disenfranchisement  and  the  History  of American  Citizenship \n6,  34,  91  (2014). \n32.  Neither  the  pre-war  state  Constitution  nor  pre-war  state  statutory  law  expressly \nauthorized  the  disenfranchisement  of infamous  persons.  According  to  one  historian, \ndisenfranchisement  for  infamy  “appears  to  have  simply  been  a  tradition.”  Jd.  at  170  n.13.  North \nCarolina  did,  however,  enact  statutory  and  constitutional  provisions  explaining  how  rights  might \nbe  restored  following  disenfranchisement  for  infamy.  See  N.C.  Const.  Art.  I,  Sec.  4,  pt.  4  (1776, \namended  in  1835);  Ch.  36,  1840  N.C.  Sess.  Laws  68. \n33.  North  Carolina’s  policy  of disenfranchising  persons  convicted  of certain  crimes \nbecame a  tool  of race-based  political  suppression  immediately  after  the  Civil  War.  In  1866,  an \ninspector  with  the  Freedman’s  Bureau  notified  a  federal  military  commander  that  white  former \nrebels  in North  Carolina  “had  found  new  use  for  longstanding  state  laws”  that  imposed  infamy \n(and  thus  effectively  disenfranchisement)  for  crimes  like  petty  larceny  that  were  punishable  by \nwhipping.  Steven  F.  Miller  et  al.,  Between  Emancipation  and Enfranchisement:  Law  and the \nPolitical Mobilization  of Black Southerners,  1865-1867,  70  Chi.-Kent  L.  Rev.  1059,  1074  (1995) \n(citing  Petition  of Wm.  C.  Watson  et  al.  to  Lt.  H.C.  Strong  (July  17,  1866)).  Across  the  state, \nthese  rebels  “conspired  to  seize  negroes,  procure  convictions  for petty  offenses  punishable  at  the \nwhipping  post,  and  thus  disqualify  them  forever  from  voting  in  North  Carolina.”  Holloway  at \n33, \n34.  |  Contemporary  sources  describe  the  whippings  as  meticulous  and  widespread. \nHarper’s  Weekly  described  a  scene  outside  a  courthouse  in  Raleigh  where  a  crowd  of five \nhundred  watched  “the  public  whipping  of colored  men  as  fast  as  they  were  convicted  and \nsentenced.”  Whipping and Selling American  Citizens,  Harper’s  Weekly  (Jan.  12,  1867).  Atlantic \n10 \nUS  167134072v2\nMonthly  chronicled  the  incident,  explaining  that  “[t]he  public  whipping  of negroes  for  paltry \noffenses  is  carried  on  in North  Carolina  on  a  large  scale,”  because  “every  man  who  has  been \npublicly  whipped  is  excluded  from  the  right  of voting.”  The  True  Problem,  Atlantic  Monthly \n374  (March  1867).  This  incident  “explains  why  disenfranchisement  for  prior  criminal \nconvictions  was  among  the  first  strategies  employed  to  block  African  American  suffrage  in \nNorth  Carolina.”  Holloway  at  34. \n35.  North  Carolina  adopted  a  new  constitution  after the  Civil  War  as  a  condition  of \nrejoining  the  Union.  See  N.C.  Const.  of  1868;  John  V.  Orth,  North  Carolina  Constitution \nHistory,  70  N.C.  L.  Rev.  1759,  1783  (1992).  Congress,  then  in  the  hands  of the  “Radical \nRepublicans,”  called  a North  Carolina  Constitutional  Convention  in  1868.  Reconstruction \nlegislation  required  that  delegates  to  the  convention  include  both  white  and  black  citizens.  Id. \nIndeed,  fifteen  of the  120  delegates  to  the  1868  Convention  were  black.  Jd. \n36.  |  The  Constitution  enacted  at  the  1868  Convention  provided  for  universal  male \nsuffrage,  eliminated  property  requirements  to  vote,  and  abolished  slavery.  See  N.C.  Const.  of \n1868,  Art.  I,  §  33;  id.  art.  VI,  §  1.  Like  its  predecessor,  the  1868  Constitution  did  not  contain  any \nprovision  that  expressly  stripped  the  vote  from  persons  convicted  of certain  crimes.  See  id.  Art. \nVI.  And  in  the  years  that  followed,  African  Americans  achieved  some  success  in  municipal, \nstate  legislative,  and  even  congressional  elections.  See,  e.g.,  William  Mabry,  White  Supremacy \nand the  North  Carolina  Suffrage Amendment,  13  N.C.  Hist.  Rev.  1  (1936);  see  also,  e.g., \nBiographical  Directory  of the  United  States  Congress,  John Adams  Hyman,  Biographical \nDirectory  of the  United  States  Congress,  James  E.  O’Hara. \n37.  Ratification  of the  1868  Constitution  “earned  North  Carolina  readmission  to \nrepresentation  in  Congress  and  the  end  of Reconstruction”  in  the  state.  Orth,  supra  at  1781.  But \n1] \nUS  167134072v2\nthe  end  of Reconstruction  in North  Carolina precipitated  the  emergence  of “pre-war  political \nforces  ..  .  in  the  form  of the  Conservative  Party”  in  1870.  Jd.  The  Conservatives,  who  would \nsoon  rebrand  themselves  as  Democrats,  won  control  of the  General  Assembly  in  1870  and \nimmediately  proposed  a  convention  to  replace  the  “hated”  1868  Constitution.  Jd.  The  General \nAssembly  initially  submitted  to  voters  the  question  as  to  whether to  call  a  constitutional \nconvention.  North  Carolina  voters  rejected  the  idea.  Id. \n38.  |  The  General  Assembly  eventually  called  a  constitutional  convention  in  1875 \nwithout  submitting  the  question  to  voters.  Jd.  The  1875  Convention  enacted  a  flurry  of \namendments  to  the  1868  Constitution  aimed  at  eroding  the  rights  of African  Americans.  These \nAmendments  required  segregation  in public  schools  and  banned  interracial  marriage.  See  1875 \nAmendments  to  the  N.C.  Const.  of  1868,  Amends.  XXVI  &  XXX.  They  also  directly  assaulted \nthe  political  rights  of African  Americans  by  stripping  counties  of the  ability  to  elect  their  own \nlocal  officials,  including judges,  giving  that  power  instead  to  the  Conservative-controlled \nGeneral  Assembly.  See  id.  Amend.  XXV.  “The  purpose  of this  amendment,  as  was  well \nunderstood,  was  to  block  control  of local  government  in  the  eastern  counties  by  blacks  who  were \nin  the  majority  there.”  Orth,  supra  at  1783. \n39.  Particularly  relevant  here,  the  1875  Amendments  codified  felony \ndisenfranchisement  in  the  state  Constitution  for  the  first  time.  See  1875  Amendments  to  the  N.C. \nConst.  of  1868,  Amend.  XXIV.  The  text  of the  original  1875  felony  disenfranchisement \namendment  largely  mirrors  the  analogous  provision  in North  Carolina’s  current  constitution. \nThe  1875  amendment  provided: \n[N]o  person  who,  upon  conviction  or  confession  in  open  Court,  shall  be  adjudged \nguilty  of  felony,  or  of  any  other  crime  infamous  by  the  laws  of  this  state,  and \nhereafter  committed,  shall  be  deemed  an  elector,  unless  such  person  shall  be \nrestored  to  the  rights  of citizenship  in  a  mode  prescribed  by  law. \n12 \nUS  167134072v2\n1875  Amendments  to  the  N.C.

North  Carolina’s  new  laws  providing  for  felony  disenfranchisement  and  depriving \nlocalities  of the  ability  to  elect their own judges  worked  hand-in-hand to  enforce  white  supremacy. \nSee  Holloway  at  62.  “The  change  in  the  composition  of  the  judiciary  .  .  .  and  the  expanded \ndisenfranchisement  provision,  added  up  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of Democratic judges”  able \nto  deprive African Americans of the right to  vote.  Jd.; see also Notes from  the  Capital, N.Y.  Times, \nOct.  11,  1875,  at  5  (explaining  that the  “evident purpose”  of these  dhanwes  was  “to prevent  colored \nmen  and  poor  white  men  from  exercising  the  right  of suffrage”). \n42.  Until the  enactment of North Carolina’s current disenfranchisement  statute,  persons \nwith  felony  convictions  were  required  to  petition  a  court  for  the  restoration  of their  right  to  vote. \nThe  decision  on  whether  to  restore  the  person’s  rights  was  left  to  the  discretion  of the  court.  See \nCh.  36,  1840  N.C.  Sess.  Laws  68. \n43.  North  Carolina’s  expansion  of its  felony  disenfranchisement  laws  following  the \nCivil  War  was  not  unique.  Many  former  Confederate  states  expanded  the  scope  of criminal \n13 \nUS  167134072v2\nhistory-based  disenfranchisement  after  1865  to  cover  most  or  all  felony  convictions  in  an  effort \nto  suppress  the  political  power  of newly  freed  slaves.  See  Manza  &  Uggen  at  49-53;  see  also  id. \nat  237-239  (listing  the  year  of each  state’s  first  felony  disenfranchisement  law).  Indeed,  “[f]lelon \nvoting  restrictions  were  the  first  widespread  set  of legal  disenfranchisement  measures  imposed \non  African  Americans;  the  literacy  tests  and  other  mechanisms  for  political  exclusion  followed  at \na  later  date.”  Daniel  S.  Goldman,  The  Modern-Day Literacy  Test:  Felon  Disenfranchisement \nand Race  Discrimination,  57  Stan.  L.  Rev.  611,  625  (2004).  These  disenfranchisement  laws \nproliferated  as  the  imprisonment  of African  Americans  increased.  By  the  1870s,  nearly  95%  of \npersons  with  felony  convictions  in  southern  states  were  African  American.  See  Christopher \nAdamson,  Punishment After  Slavery:  Southern  Penal Systems,  1865-1890,  Oxford  University \nPress  (1983). \n44.  Following  the  Civil  War,  the  political  power  of the  then-Democratic  Party  in \nNorth  Carolina  waxed  and  waned  over  the  next  several  decades.  In  an  effort  to  regain  and \nsolidify  their  power,  the  party  championed  “rigid  safeguards”  against  voting  by  “ex-convicts,” \nState  Democratic  Executive  Committee  of North  Carolina,  The  Democratic  Handbook (1898)  at \n84,  and  sought  to  implement  those  “safeguards”  after  regaining  power  in  1898. \n45.  In  the  leadup  to  the  1898  election,  the  then-Democratic  Party  ran  “a  vicious  racist \ncampaign  the  likes  of which the  state  had  never  seen.”  William  S.  Powell,  North  Carolina \nthrough  Four  Centuries,  433  (1989).  The  campaign  expressly  emphasized  the  need  for  “white \nmen  [to]  control  and  govern”  the  State.  State  Democratic  Executive  Committee  of North \nCarolina,  The  Democratic  Handbook  (1898)  at  38;  see  also  id.  (“It  is  better  for  the  negro,  as  well \nas  for the  white  man,  that  the  white  man  should  make  and  administer  the  laws  ..  .  .  It  has  been  in \nthe  past,  and  is  to-day,  the  special  mission  of the  Democratic  Party  to  rescue  the  white  people  of \n14 \nUS  167134072v2\nthe  east[ern  part  of the  State]  from  the  curse  of negro  domination.”).  The  party  sent  “persuasive \nspeakers  into  virtually  every  community  in North  Carolina to  report  on  the  evils  of Negro \ndomination”  and  widely  circulated a letter  “calling  upon  whites  to  stand  together  in  support  of \n‘White  Supremacy.’”  North  Carolina  through  Four  Centuries  at  433-35.  The  campaign  also \nfeatured  racist newspaper  editorials  and  cartoons  showing  the  threat  purportedly  posed  by \nAfrican  American political  influence,  including  the  following  cartoon  featured  in  the  Raleigh \nNews  &  Observer  on  October  27,  1898: \n  \nSee  “A  Vampire  that  Hovers  Over North  Carolina,”  UNC Libraries.' \n46.  In plotting  their return  to  power,  the  turn-of the-century  Democrats  observed  with \nalarm  that  “fully  one-third  [of votes  in North  Carolina]  is  cast  by  the  negroes”  and  partially \nattributed  that  number to  voting  by  people  with  felony  convictions.  See  id.  at  37,  88.  They \nfurther  observed  that  additional  restrictions  on  voting  by  people  with  felony  convictions  were \nneeded  “in  order  to  protect  the  white  voters  of the  State  against  having  their  honest  votes  off-set \n  \n\"  https://exhibits.lib.unc.edu/items/show/2215. \n15 \n  \nUS  167134072v2\nby  illegally  and  fraudulently  registered  negro  votes.”  Id.  at  84;  see  also  id.  at  88  (explaining  that \n“negro  ex-convicts  .  .  .  were  registered  and  voted  galore  .  .  .  leav[ing]  to  the  white  voters  of \nNorth  Carolina  no  protection  against  this  fraudulent  registration  save  what their  courage  and \nAnglo-Saxon  manhood  may  give  them’’). \n47.  Democrats  prevailed  in the  1898  election,  regaining  control  of the  General \nAssembly.  The  victory  was  interpreted  as  “an  ultimatum  to  curb  the  political  power  of the \nNegro.”  William  Mabry,  White  Supremacy  and the  North  Carolina  Suffrage Amendment,  13 \nN.C.  Hist.  Rev.  1  (1936).  Over  the  next  several  years,  the  General  Assembly  enacted  numerous \nlaws  designed  to  suppress  African-American  political  power,  including  a literacy  test  (that \nexempted  white  citizens),  a poll  tax,  and  harsh  new  penalties  for  voting  with  a  felony  conviction. \nSee  id.;  see  Ch.  507,  1899 N.C.  Sess.  Laws  658,  681  (penalizing  voting  by  persons  with  felony \nconvictions  with  “imprison[ment]  at  hard  labor  not  exceeding  two  years”’). \n48.  To  this  day,  the  harsh  criminal  penalties  imposed  on  voting  by  persons  with \nfelony  convictions  continue  to  have a  deterrent  effect  on  awful voting  by  re-enfranchised \npersons. \nB.  Today’s  Law  Prolongs  Disenfranchisement  Through  Probation  and  Parole \n49.  Adopted  in  1971,  the  current  felony  disenfranchisement  provision  of the  North \nCarolina  Constitution provides  as  follows: \nDisqualification  of felon.  No  person  adjudged  guilty  of a  felony  against this  State \nor  the  United  States,  or  adjudged  guilty  of a  felony  in  another  state  that  also \nwould  be a  felony  if it  had  been  committed  in  this  State,  shall  be  permitted  to  vote \nunless  that  person  shall  be  first  restored  to  the  rights  of citizenship  in  the  manner \nprescribed  by  law. \nN.C.  Const.,  Art.  VI,  §  2,  cl.  3. \n50.  Also  in  1971,  the  General  Assembly  enacted  a new  felony  disenfranchisement \nstatute  maintaining  the  prior  policy  of disenfranchising  people  even  after  release  from \n16 \nUS  167134072v2\nincarceration.  Specifically,  the  1971  statute  provided  that  people  with  felony  convictions \nregained  the  right  to  vote  if either  “the  Department  of Correction  at  the  time  of release \nrecommend|[ed]  restoration”  or  “two  years  have  elapsed  since  release  by  the  Department  of \nCorrection,  including probation  or parole.”  See \nhttps://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/sessionlaws/pdf/1971-1972/s11971-902.pdf (emphasis \nadded). \n51.  The  General  Assembly  amended  this  statute  in  1973,  adopting  the  essential \nlanguage  that  is  currently  in  effect—namely,  that people  with  felony  convictions  regain  the  right \nto  vote  only  upon  an  “unconditional  discharge”  not  only  from  incarceration,  but  also  from \nprobation,  parole,  or  a  suspended  sentence.  See \nhttps://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/SessionLaws/PDF/1973-1974/SL1973-251 .pdf. \n52.  The  current  statute,  last  amended  in  2013,  provides  as  follows: \nAny  person  convicted  of a  crime,  whereby  the  rights  of citizenship  are  forfeited, \nshall  have  such  rights  automatically  restored  upon  the  occurrence  of any  one  of \nthe  following  conditions: \n(1)  The  unconditional  discharge  of an  inmate,  of a  probationer,  or  of a  parolee  by \nthe  agency  of the  State  having jurisdiction  of that person  or  of a  defendant  under  a \nsuspended  sentence  by  the  court. \n(2)  The  unconditional  pardon  of the  offender. \n(3)  The  satisfaction  by  the  offender  of all  conditions  of a  conditional  pardon. \n(4)  With  regard  to  any  person  convicted  of a  crime  against  the  United  States,  the \nunconditional  discharge  of such  person  by  the  agency  of the  United  States  having \njurisdiction  of such  person,  the  unconditional  pardon  of such  person  or  the \nsatisfaction  by  such  person  of a  conditional  pardon. \n(5)  With  regard  to  any  person  convicted  of a  crime  in  another  state,  the \nunconditional  discharge  of such  person  by  the  agency  of that  state  having \njurisdiction  of such  person,  the  unconditional  pardon  of such  person  or  the \nsatisfaction  by  such  person  of a  conditional  pardon. \nN.C.G.S.A.  §  13-1. \nKs \nUS  167134072v2\n53.  Under  this  law,  North  Carolinians  who  have  been  released  from  incarceration  but \nhave  not  been  “unconditionally  discharged”  from  probation  or  post-release  supervision  cannot \nvote.  Additionally,  North  Carolinians  who  have  been  convicted  of a  felony  and  are  sentenced  to \ncommunity  supervision  without  incarceration  cannot  vote. \n54.  The  terms  of this  law  extend  the  disenfranchisement  of people  already  deemed  fit \nto  return  to  or remain  in  society.  The  requirement  that  a  person  complete  any  term  of parole  or \npost-release  supervision  can  delay  restoration  of the  right  to  vote  by  at  least  one  year  after  the \nperson’s  release  from  incarceration.  See  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1372(a).  And  the  requirement  that  a \nperson  complete  any  term  of probation  imposes  delays  that  are  typically  even  longer—and  of \nuncertain  duration  due  to  the  potential  for  modifications,  extensions,  or  early  termination.  See \nN.C.G.S.  §  15A-1344(a),  (d);  N.C.G.S.  §  1SA-1342(a). \n55.  Once  an  individual  is  on  probation,  a  court  has  the  power  “at  any  time”  prior  to \nthe  termination  of probation  to  extend  the  period  of probation  “for  good  cause,”  regardless  of \nwhether  that  person  has  violated  probation.  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1344(d).  Probation  hearings, \nwhether  to  revoke  or  extend,  are  “regarded  as  informal  or  summary”  and  provide  minimal  due \nprocess  protections.  State  v.  Sellars,  185  N.C.  App.  726, 728,  649  S.E.2d  656,  657  (2007).  With \nevery  extension  of probation,  that  person’s  disenfranchisement  is  likewise  extended. \n56.  In  2018,  “Property  and  non-trafficking  drug  offenses  comprised  76%  of probation \nsentences.”  North  Carolina  Sentencing  &  Policy  Advisory  Commission,  Structured  Sentencing \nStatistical  Report  at  22,  24  (2018). \n57.  According  to  recent  data  from  the  North  Carolina  Sentencing  and  Policy  Advisory \nCommission,  the  average  length  of probation  for  “intermediate”  felony  convictions  (i.e.,  for \nClass  D,  E,  F,  G,  H,  or  I  felony  offenses)  is  26  months.  See  North  Carolina  Sentencing  &  Policy \n18 \nUS  167134072v2\nAdvisory  Commission,  Structured  Sentencing  Statistical  Report  at  23  (2018).  The  average \nlength  of probation  is  longer  for  more  serious  felony  offenses.  Class  D  felony  offenses,  for \ninstance,  carry  an  average  probation period  of 42  months.  Id.? \nC.  Today’s  Law  Conditions  the  Right  to  Vote  on  the  Ability  to  Pay  Court  Costs \nSS.  Because North  Carolina  law  requires  the  payment  of court  costs,  fees,  and \nrestitution  as  a  condition  of probation,  North  Carolina’s  disenfranchisement  statute,  N.C.G.S.  § \n13-1,  effectively  conditions  the  right to  vote  on  a person’s  ability  to  pay.  As  a result,  people  who \nhave  otherwise  completed the  terms  of their probation  but  cannot  afford  to  pay  court  costs  are \ndenied  the  right  to  vote  due  to  the  continuation  on  their  probation.  By  contrast,  otherwise \nsimilarly  situated  people  who  can  pay  will  be  discharged  from  probation  and  regain  the  right to \nvote. \n59.  North  Carolina  law provides  that  “[a]s  regular  conditions  of probation,  a \ndefendant  must.  .  .  [p]ay  the  costs  of court,  any  fine  ordered  by  the  court,  and  make  restitution  or \nreparation  as  provided  in  subsection  (d).”  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1343(b)(9).  Court  costs  in North \nCarolina  have  increased  400%  over the  past  twenty  years.  See  Heather  Hunt  and  Gene  Nichol, \nCourt Fines  and Fees:  Criminalizing Poverty  in North  Carolina  (“Criminalizing Poverty’)  at  4, \nNorth  Carolina  Poverty  Research  Fund  (2017).  In  1999,  a North  Carolinian  charged  with  a \nfelony  would  face  a  total  of $106  in  court  fines  and  fees.  ACLU  of North  Carolina,  The \nConsequences  of Rising  Court  Fines  and  Fees  in North  Carolina  (“ACLU  Report”)  at  10  (2019). \nBut  today,  “$106  would  barely  cover two-thirds  of the  General  Court  of Justice  fee  in  district \ncourt.”  Jd. \n  \n2  Data is not presently  available  for the average  length of probation  for Class B  or C  felony offenses.  Probation  is \nnot available  for Class A  felony  offenses.  See N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1340.17. \n19 \nUS  167134072v2\n60.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  overwhelming  majority  of people  who  are \ncriminal  defendants  in North  Carolina  are  indigent,  the  General  Assembly  has  imposed  a  wide \narray  of court  costs  on  those  defendants  who  are  convicted  or  plead  guilty  in  Superior  Court, \nwhich  has jurisdiction  over  all  felony  cases.  These  costs  include: \n General  Court  of Justice  Fee   $154.00 \n Facilities  Fee   $30.00 \n Telecommunications  Fee   $4.00 \n Fee  “[flor the  retirement  and  insurance   $6.25 \nbenefits  of ..  .  law  enforcement  officers” \n Fee  “for the  supplemental  pension  benefits  of   $1.25 \nsheriffs” \n    Fee  “[flor the  services,  staffing,  and      $2.00    \noperations  of the  Criminal  Justice  Education \nand  Standards  Commission” \n Pretrial  Release  Services  Fee   $15.00 \n Fee  “[flor  each  arrest  or  personal  service  of   $5.00 \ncriminal  process” \n DNA  Fee   $2.00 \n  \nSee  N.C.G.S.  §  7A-304(a)(1)-(13).  Individuals  who  are  unable  to  pay  these  fees  “within  40  days \nof the  date  specified  in  the  court’s judgment”  must  additionally  pay  a  late  fee  of $50.00.  Id.  § \n7A-304(a)(6). \n61.  |  The  General  Assembly  has  also  imposed  significant  costs  arising  from  probation \nitself.  People  must  “[p]ay  the  State  of North  Carolina  for the  costs  of appointed  counsel,  public \ndefender,  or  appellate  defender to  represent  him  in  the  case(s)  for which  he  was  placed  on \nprobation.”  Jd.  §  15A-1343(b)(10).  They  also  must  “[p]ay  a  supervision  fee”  of $40.00  per \nmonth.  Jd.  §  15A-1343(b)(6),  (cl).  Given  that  the  average  person  convicted  of an  intermediate \nfelony  will  serve  26  months  of probation,  the  average  person  must pay  $1,040  in  supervision  fees \nalone  to  satisfy  the  terms  of their probation.  On  top  of that,  “[a]ny  person  placed  on  house  arrest \nwith  electronic  monitoring  .  .  .  shall  pay  a  fee  of ninety  dollars  ($90.00)  for the  electronic \n20 \nUS  167134072v2\nmonitoring  device  and  a  daily  fee  in  an  amount that  reflects  the  actual  cost  of providing  the \nelectronic  monitoring.”  Jd.  §  15A-1343(c2). \n62.  These  required  payments  impose  substantial  hardships  on  criminal  defendants, \nmany  of whom  lack  the  requisite  resources  to  make  them.  Nationally,  around  80  to  90%  of those \ncharged  with  a  criminal  offense  are  poor  enough  to  qualify  for  a  court-appointed  lawyer. \nCriminalizing Poverty  at  6.  And  60%  of those  charged  earned  less  than  $1,000  per  month  before \ntheir  incarceration.  Jd.  In  North  Carolina,  people  released  from  incarceration  are  often  unable  to \nobtain  employment  enabling  them  to  pay  these  substantial  fees  given  that  30%  have  no  more \nthan  a  ninth-grade  education,  and  less  than  1%  have  a  college  education.  Jd. \n63.  While  North  Carolina  law  allows judges  to  waive  certain  court  costs  for  “just \ncause,”  N.C.G.S.  §  7A-304,  waivers  are  exceedingly  rare.  In  2018, judges  issued  waivers  in  only \n3%  of cases.  See  North  Carolina  Administrative  Office  of the  Courts,  2019  Report  on  Criminal \nCost  Waivers  at  35  (2019).  While  the  rate  at  which judges  grant  cost  waivers  has  always  been \nlow,  the  rate  has  plummeted  even  further  after  the  General  Assembly  enacted  a  law  in  2015 \nrequiring  the  Administrative  Office  of the  Courts  to  track  the  number  of times  individual judges \nissued  waivers.  See  ACLU  Report,  at  13-15;  N.C.G.S.  §  7A-350. \n64.  | Making  matters  worse, judges  rarely  inquire  into  a  defendant’s  ability  to  pay  court \ncosts  even  though  nearly  90%  of persons  charged  with  a  crime  are  indigent.  According  to  recent \ncourt  observations  in  Robeson,  Edgecombe,  and  Avery  Counties,  “a  defendant’s  ability  to  pay \ncourt  fines  and  fees  was  weighed  in  24  percent,  5  percent,  and  25  percent  of cases,  respectively.” \nACLU  Report  at  15  n.43. \n65.  Payment  of the  fees  discussed  above  is  a  “condition  of probation.”  N.C.G.S.A. \n§  15A-1343.  And  failing  to  make  these  payments  constitutes  a  “violation  of a  condition  of \nAl \nUS  167134072v2\nprobation”  that  authorizes  the  court  to  extend  the  term  of probation—and  thus  the  denial  of the \nright  to  vote—to  a  maximum  of five  years.  Id.  §  15A-1344(a),  (d).  A  court  may  extend  the  term \nof probation  for people  convicted  of felonies  by  an  additional  three  years  “for  the  purpose  of \nallowing  the  defendant to  complete  a program  of restitution.”  Jd.  §  15A-1342(a). \n66.  Notwithstanding  high rates  of indigence  and  the  failure  of courts  to  assess  ability \nto  pay,  people  are  regularly  arrested  and  subjected  to  extended  periods  of probation  for  failing  to \npay  court  fines.  See  ACLU  Report  at  24-30.  For  example,  out  of  110  court  observations \nconducted  in  Robeson  County  in  2017,  “[a]  staggering  32  observations  ended  in  an  individual \nincarcerated  for  failure  to  pay  fees  and  fines.”  Jd.  at  24.  Even  when  people  have  otherwise \ncomplied  with  the  terms  of their probation,  courts  will  extend  the  period  of probation  for  failing \nto  pay  costs.  See  id.  at  29-30.  The  result  is  that people  remain  disenfranchised  based  on  their \ninability  to  pay  court  costs. \nD.  Today’s  Law  Deprives  Roughly  70,000  North  Carolinians  of the  Right  to \nVote  Even  Though  They  Have  Been  Released  From  Incarceration \n67.  North  Carolina  law  does  not  require  state  authorities  to  notify  people  when  their \nrights  are  restored.  Although  the  law  requires  the  State  Board  of Elections  (“State  Board”  or \n“SBOE”)  to  inform  people  after  a  felony  conviction  of their  loss  of voting  rights  by  mail,  see \nN.C.G.S.A.  §  163.82.14(c)(3)  (previously  codified  at  §  163A-877),  no  comparable  law requires \nthe  State  Board  to  notify  people  when  their  rights  are  restored  following  their  “unconditional \ndischarge”  from  any  state-ordered  probation  or parole. \n68.  Even  after  people’s  rights  are  restored,  some  sit  out  elections  based  on  fear that \nthey  will  be  prosecuted  for  voting  illegally.  This  lack  of clarity  is  particularly  problematic  for \npeople  with  felony  convictions,  who  disproportionately  have  low  levels  of education.  Trial \ncourts  sometimes  order  this  narrow-purpose  extension  in  error,  leaving  people  convicted  of \n22 \nUS  167134072v2\nfelonies  on  probation  for  additional  years  without  legal  authority.  See  State  v.  Hoskins,  242  N.C. \nApp.  168,  775  S.E.2d  15  (2015)  (holding  that  trial  court  lacked  authority  for three-year  extension \nand  vacating  probation  violation  order  after  defendant  completed  full  eight  years  of probation). \n69.  Under North  Carolina  law,  “a  superior  court judge  may  not  accept  a  plea  of guilty \nor  no  contest  from  the  defendant  without  first  addressing  him  personally”  and  informing  that \nperson  of certain  rights  and  effects  of the  guilty  plea,  including  possible  immigration \nconsequences.  N.C.G.S.  §  15A-1022(a).  The  standard  plea transcript  form  sets  out  additional \nadmonitions,  including  that  “you  may  forfeit  any  State  licensing  privileges  you  have  in  the  event \nthat  your  probation  is  revoked.”  Form  AOC-CR-300.  Neither  the  statute  nor the  form  makes \nany  mention  of the  loss  or restoration  of the  right  to  vote. \n70.  As  with  loss  of the  right  to  vote,  the  trial  court  is  not  required  to  inform  an \nindividual  of the  existence  of post-release  supervision  as  part  of a  guilty  plea.  As  one  criminal \njustice  scholar  has  noted,  this  leads  to  widespread  misunderstanding: \nI  get  a  lot  of  mail  from  inmates.  Lately,  many  of  them  have  written  to  express \ntheir  surprise  upon  being  told  by  prison  officials—for  the  first  time—that  they \nwill  have  to  complete  a  term  of  post-release  supervision  when  they  get  out  of \nprison.  Sex  offenders—especially  Class  F—I  sex  offenders,  including  those \nconvicted  of indecent  liberties—are  very  surprised  to  learn  that  they  will  be  on \nPRS  for five  years. \nJamie  Markham,  “Surprise  Post-Release  Supervision,” North  Carolina  Criminal Law  Blog  (June \n11,2015).  Paradoxically,  this  surprise  period  of additional  disenfranchisement  based  on \nsupervision  includes  conditions  that  allow  people  released  from  incarceration  to  obtain  credits \nfor  “reintegration  into  society”.  N.C.G.S.§  15A-1368.4(d). \n71.  According  to  a  2017  estimate,  69,386  North  Carolina  voting-aged  citizens  are \nunable  to  vote  because  they  remain  on  felony  probation  or  post-release  supervision.  See \nSouthern  Coalition  for  Social  Justice,  The  Freedom  to  Vote:  Felony  Disenfranchisement  in North \n23 \nUS  167134072v2\nCarolina  at  5  (August  2019)  (“Southern  Coalition  Report”).  These  estimates  do  not  capture \nthose  who  are  eligible  to  vote  but  remain  off the  rolls  due  to  misinformation  or  fear  of \nprosecution.  Indeed,  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  calculate  the  full  extent  of disenfranchisement \ndue  to  the  persistent  failure  of state  authorities  to  inform  people  with  felony  convictions  about \ntheir  voting  rights. \n72.  These  nearly  70,000  North  Carolinians  disenfranchised  by  the  state  are  among \nthose  whom  CSI,  Justice  Served,  Wash  Away  Unemployment,  and  the  North  Carolina NAACP \nhelp  transition  back  into  society,  work  with  to  provide  resources  as  they  overcome  the  collateral \nconsequences  of their  criminal  convictions,  and  assist  in  understanding  their  voting  rights. \nVoting  restrictions  on  these  citizens  force  these  organizational  plaintiffs  to  divert  resources \ntoward  voting  rights  education  efforts  and  away  from  other  programming  initiatives  including \nthose  geared  at  facilitating  reintegration,  providing  necessary  resources  for  employment, \nhousing,  and  other  basic  needs,  and  otherwise  assisting  their  full  civic  engagement. \n73.  The  number  of North  Carolinians  effected  by  probation  or post-release  felony \ndisenfranchisement  is  substantial  compared  to  the  narrow  margins  of victories  by  which  elections \nin North  Carolina  are  often  decided.  In  2014,  for  example,  a  nonpartisan  election  for  District \nCourt  Judge  was  decided  by  five  votes  out  of more  than  60,000  votes  cast,  with  the  winner \nprevailing  by  a  margin  of 30,746  to  30,741.  See  SBOE,  2014  Election  Results.’  Municipal \nelections  are  often  decided  by  comparably  small  margins.  In  November  2019,  for  example,  a \nnonpartisan  city  council  race  in  Burlington,  North  Carolina  was  decided  by  a  margin  of 2,780  to \n  \n3  https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/04/2014&county_id=0&office=JUD&contest=0. \n24 \nUS  167134072v2\n2.739.  See  SBOE,  2019  Election  Results.*  Similarly,  elections  to  the  General  Assembly  are \noften  decided  by just  hundreds  of votes.  See,  e.g.,  SBOE,  2018  Election  Results.° \n74.  By  denying  the  fundamental  right  to  vote  to  substantial  numbers  of voting-aged \ncitizens  who  are  otherwise  full  participants  in  society,  North  Carolina’s  felony \ndisenfranchisement  laws  create  a  significant  risk  that  election  results  may  not  reflect  the  will  of \nthe  majority. \nE.  Today’s  Law  Disproportionately  Disenfranchises  African  Americans \n75.  Today,  as  in  the  Jim-Crow  era,  the  policy  of disenfranchising  people  even  after \ntheir release  from  incarceration  continues  to  disproportionately  harm  people  of color today. \nAlthough  African  Americans  represent  about  20%  of the  voting  population  in North  Carolina, \nthey  represent  roughly  40%  of the  people  disenfranchised  following  release  from  incarceration. \nSee  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Annual Estimates  of the  Resident Population  by  Sex,  Age,  Race  Alone \nor  in  Combination  (2018).  African-American  men,  in particular,  comprise  a  disproportionate \npercentage  of the  post-release  supervision  population.  According  to  data  from  2017,  black men \nmake  up  9.2%  of the  North  Carolina  voting  age  population,  but  comprise  40%  of the  male \nprobation  population  in  the  state.  See  id.  Black women  are  nearly  11%  of the  voting  population, \nbut  comprise  about  24%  of the  female  probation  population.  See  id. \n76.  Unsurprisingly,  the  burdens  of North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  law \nfall  disproportionately  on  the  eastern part  of the  State,  where  much  of North  Carolina’s  African \nAmerican  population  resides. \n  \n4  https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=1 1/05/2019&county_id=0&office=CCL&contest=0. \n>  https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/06/2018&county_id=0&office=-FED&contest=0. \n25 \nUS  167134072v2\n  \nPercentage  of  18+  Population  Under  Probation  by  County  (2017) \n     \n  \nDisenfranchisement Rate \n[|  0.27% - 0.77% \n[9  78% - 1.02% \n     \nWE  1.03% - 1.3% \nGR  1.51%-  1.54% \nPopulation Geta,  2090 Census! 2017 WO Aviomated Criminal Infractions System (ACIS) Date \n  \n  \nSee  Southern  Coalition  Report  at  7;  see  also  id.  at  22-44  (providing  data  on  county-by-county \ndisenfranchisement  rates). \nF.  There  Is  No  Legitimate  Government  Interest  in  Continuing  to  Disenfranchise \nPeople  With  Past  Felony  Convictions  Who  Live  in  North  Carolina \nCommunities \n77.  There  is  no  legitimate,  let  alone  compelling,  government  interest  in  continuing  to \ndisenfranchise  people  with  past  felony  convictions  who  live  in North  Carolina  communities  and \nare  subject to  the  laws  and  policies  enacted  by  elected  officials. \n78.  On  the  contrary,  research  overwhelmingly  shows  that  civic  engagement  plays  a \ncritical  role  in  helping  persons  with  felony  convictions  re-join  society.  As  one  study  observes, \n  \n“Tp]eople  who  are  part  of the  decision  making  process  not  only  have  a  greater  investment  in  the \ndecisions,  but  a  greater  investment  in  society  as  well.  .  ..  Those  who  participate  in  the \ndemocratic  process  have  a  greater  investment  in  the  resulting  decisions,  and  more  importantly, \n26 \nUS  167134072v2\nan  investment  in  preserving  that  process.”  See  Holona  Leanne  Ochs,  “Colorblind”  Policy  in \nBlack and  White:  Racial  Consequences  of Disenfranchisement Policy,  34  Pol’y  Stud.  J.  81,  89 \n(2006).  Another  found  that  the  “desire  to  be  productive  and  give  something  back  to  society”  was \ncritical  to  reintegration.  See  Christopher  Uggen  et  al.,  ‘Less  Than  the Average  Citizen’:  Stigma, \nRole  Transition  and the  Civic  Reintegration  of Convicted Felons,  in After  Crime  and \nPunishment:  Pathways  to  Offender  Reintegration  263  (Shadd  Maruna  &  Russ  Immarigeon  eds., \n2004). \n79.  Studies  also  show that  civically  engaged  citizens  are  less  likely  to  recidivate.  The \ndata  shows  that  “bringing  people  into  the  political  process  makes  them  stakeholders,  which  in \nturn  helps  steer them  away  from  future  crimes.”  Brennan  Center  for  Justice:  Florida:  An  Outlier \nin  Denying  Voting  Rights  at  18  (2016).  For  example,  Florida  (which  until  2019  required  felons \nto  affirmatively  petition  to  have  their  rights  restored)  has  published  data  comparing  recidivism \nrates  among  people  previously  convicted  of felonies  who  have  been  re-enfranchised  to  those  who \nremain  disenfranchised,  and  the  numbers  are  stunning.  Although  the  average  annual  recidivism \nrate  in  Florida  is  around  30  percent,  virtually  no  one  who  had  their  rights  restored  re-offended. \nSee  id.  (“In  2011,  of the  52  people  granted  [restoration  of civil  rights  (“RCR”)],  zero  were \nreturned  to  custody.  In  2012,  out  of the  342  people  granted  RCR,  only  one  re-offended.  In \n2013,  out  of 569  people  granted  RCR,  zero  re-offended.  In  2014,  of 562  people  granted  RCR, \nthree  re-offended.  In  2015,  of 427  people  granted  RCR,  one  re-offended.”’). \n80.  Voting  restrictions  on  citizens  no  longer  incarcerated  (or  who  never  were \nincarcerated)  also  harm  entire  families.  Studies  show  that  when  heads  of households  are \ndisenfranchised,  the  level  of civic  engagement  for  the  entire  family  drops.  See  Erika  Wood, \nRestoring the  Right  to  Vote,  Brennan  Ctr.  for  Justice,  at  13  (2009).  Children  frequently  learn \nzi \nUS  167134072v2\nabout the  importance  of voting  from  their  parents.  Many  parents  take  their  children  with  them \ninto  the  voting  booth—a  formative  experience  that  is  often  a  child’s  first  act  of civic \nengagement.  See  id.  (explaining  that  “[a]  parent’s  electoral  participation  plays  a  significant  role \nin  determining  whether his  child  will  become  civically  engaged”).  According  to  one  study,  a \nparent’s  political  participation  has  more  influence  on  a  child’s  decision  to  vote  in  the  future  than \nany  other  factor.  See  Eric  Plutzer,  Becoming a  Habitual  Voter:  Inertia,  Resources,  and Growth \nin  Young Adulthood,  96  Am.  Pol.  Sci.  Rev.  41,  43  (2002).  The  ripple  effects  of \ndisenfranchisement  are  felt  across  generations. \n81.  For  these  reasons,  probation  and  parole  officers—who  work  with  persons  with \nfelony  convictions  and  are  among  the  closest  to  understanding  the  relevant  interests  at  stake— \nfrequently  assert  that  voting  restrictions  lack  a  coherent justification.  See  Amicus  Br.  of \nAmerican  Probation  &  Parole  Assoc.  at  13-15,  Hand v.  Scott,  NO.  18-11388  (11th  Cir.  2018) \n(“Probation  and  parole  officers  are  the  state  officials  most  directly  responsible  for  reintegrating \noffenders  back  into  society  after their term  of imprisonment.  Among  these  officers,  there  is  a \ngrowing  consensus  that  voting  plays  an  important  role  in  the  reintegration  process.”).  The \nAmerican  Probation  and  Parole  Association,  the  American  Correctional  Association,  and  the \nAssociation  of Paroling  Authorities  International  have  each  enacted  resolutions  supporting  the \nrestoration  of voting  rights  for  persons  with  felony  convictions.  See  id.  The  American \nCorrectional  Association  maintains,  for  example,  that  voting  restrictions  on  a  person  after \nsuccessful  discharge  from  correctional  supervision  is  “contradictory  to  the  goals  of a  democracy, \nthe  rehabilitation  of felons,  and  their  successful  reentry  to  the  community.”  Am.  Corr.  Ass’n, \nPublic  Correctional Policy  on  Restoration  of Voting Rights for  Felony  Offenders  2005-3,  in \nPublic  Correctional Policies  73  (Jan.  25,  2017). \n28 \nUS  167134072v2\n82.  Prosecutors  and  other  law  enforcement  officials  have  echoed  these  views.  The \nformer  President  of the  Police  Foundation  has  asserted  that,  rather  than  treating  persons  with \nfelony  convictions  as  a  “pariah  class,”  we  need to  bring  people  back  as  whole  citizens”  in  order \nto  have  “effective  policing.”  Wood,  Restoring the  Right  to  Vote  at  10.  The  former  President  of \nthe  Police  Executive  Research  Forum  has  asserted  that  it  is  “better to  remove  any  obstacles  that \nstand  in  the  way  of offenders  resuming  a  full,  healthy,  productive  life.”  /d.  And  a  former \nprosecutor  from  Kentucky  has  added  that  “we  spend  millions  to  rehabilitate  offenders  and  bring \nthem  back  into  society  only  to  let  an  outdated  system  push  them  back  with  one  hand  while  we \npull  with  the  other.”  R.  David  Stengel,  Ler’s  Simplify  the  Process for Disenfranchised  Voters, \nCent.  Ky.  News-J  (Jan.  28,  2007).° \n83.  The  General  Assembly’s  unconstitutional  and  arbitrary  voting  restrictions  thus \npose  a  significant  barrier  to  individuals  with  past  felony  convictions  seeking  to  reintegrate  and \nbe  productive  and  contributing  members  of society.  These  restrictions  are  plainly  at  odds  with \nthe  missions  of CSI,  Justice  Served,  Wash  Away  Unemployment,  and  the  North  Carolina \nNAACP  and  force  these  organizational  plaintiffs  to  divert  resources  toward  voter  education \nefforts  about these  restrictions  and  away  from  other  programming  that  helps  individuals \ntransition  back  to  and  participate  fully  in  society. \n84.  Eliminating  voting  restrictions  on North  Carolinians  with  felony  convictions \nliving  in  community  will  also  reduce  inaccurate  voter  purges.  North  Carolina  removes \napproximately  10,000  citizens  from  its  voter  rolls  each  year  due  to  felony  convictions.  See \nMelissa  Boughton:  Monday Numbers:  Who  has  been  removed from  NC’s  voter  rolls?,  N.C. \nPolicy  Watch  (Aug.  19,  2019)  (8,574  registered  voters  with  felony  convictions  removed  from  the \n  \n® https://bit.ly/2Kia8Ea. \n29 \nUS  167134072v2\nNorth  Carolina rolls  in  2018;  9,150  in  2017).  But  these  purges  are  often  inaccurate,  as  the  State \nBoard  of Elections  frequently  misclassifies  voters  and  inaccurately  removes  voters  from  the  rolls \nin  reliance  on  its  rules  prohibiting  people  from  voting  due  to  a  prior  felony  conviction,  even  after \ntheir  release  from  incarceration.  See,  e.g.,  Proposed  Findings  of Fact  &  Conclusions  of Law J \n214,  League  of Women  Voters  v.  North  Carolina,  997  F.  Supp.  2d  322  (M.D.N.C.  Aug.  17,  2015) \n(sworn  testimony  asserting  that  voters  have  been  “incorrectly  identified  as  having  been  convicted \nof a  felony  and purged  from  [the]  voter  roll’’). \nCLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nCOUNT  ONE \nViolation  of North  Carolina’s  Free  Elections  Clause,  Art.  I,  §  10 \n85.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  all  other  paragraphs  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \n86.  Article  I,  Section  10  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution,  which  has  no  counterpart \nin the  U.S.  Constitution,  provides  that  “All  elections  shall  be  free.” \n87.  North  Carolina’s  Free  Elections  Clause  traces  its  roots  to  the  1689  English  Bill  of \nRights,  which  declared  that  “Elections  of members  of Parliament  ought  to  be  free.”  Bill  of \nRights  1689,  1  W.  &  M.  c.2  (Eng.);  see  John  V.  Orth,  North  Carolina  Constitutional History,  70 \nN.C.  L.  Rev.  1759,  1797-98  (1992). \n88.  This  provision  in  the  English  Bill  of Rights  responded  to  efforts  by  the  king  to \nmanipulate  parliamentary  elections  by  manipulating  the  composition  of the  electorate.  J.R. \nJones,  The  Revolution  of 1688  in  England  148  (1972).  The  king  could  modify  voter  eligibility \nrules  by  issuing  municipal  charters,  and  in  some  areas  he  would  issue  new  charters  to  shrink  the \nelectorate  to  help  his  allies,  while  in  others,  he  expanded  the  electorate  to  ensure  his  opponents \nwould  lose.  See  George  H.  Jones,  Convergent Forces:  Immediate  Causes  of the  Revolution  of \n1688  in  England 75-78  (1990).  The  king  thus  manipulated  the  electorate  in  different  areas \n30 \nUS  167134072v2\n“based  on the  detailed  suggestions  of the  [king’s]  agents  as  to  what  specific  local  rights  could, \nwith  electoral  advantage,  be  confirmed  or  extended.”  J.R.  Jones,  The  Revolution  of 1688  in \nEngland  148  (1972).  The  king’s  efforts  to  manipulate  elections  led  to  a revolution.  After \ndethroning  the  king,  the  revolutionaries  called  for  a  “free  and  lawful  parliament”  as a  critical \nreform,  and they  enacted  the  free  elections  clause.  Grey  S.  De  Krey,  Restoration  and Revolution \nin  Britain:  A  Political History  of the  Era  of Charles  II and the  Glorious  Revolution  241,  247-48, \n250  (2007). \n89.  |  Numerous  states  in  addition  to  North  Carolina  have  free  elections  clauses  that \ntrace  their  roots  to  the  English  Bill  of Rights.  For  instance,  Pennsylvania  adopted  its  version  of \nfree  elections  clause  in  1776.  See  League  of Women  Voters  v.  Commonwealth,  178  A.3d  737, \n806-07  (Pa.  2018).  As  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court  has  explained,  Pennsylvania’s  free \nelections  provision  reflected  “a  desire  to  secure  access  to  the  election  process  by  all  people  with \nan  interest  in  the  communities  in  which  they  lived—universal  suffrage—by  prohibiting  exclusion \nfrom  the  election  process  of those  without  property  or  financial  means.”  Jd.  at  807.  “It,  thus, \nestablished  a  critical  leveling  protection  in  an  effort to  establish  the  uniform  right  of the  people .  . \n.  to  select their  representatives  in  government,”  and  “sought  to  ensure  that  this  right  of the  people \nwould  forever  remain  equal  no  matter  their  financial  situation  or  social  class.”  Jd. \n90.  North  Carolina  adopted  its  Free  Elections  Clause  in  1776,  the  same  year  as \nPennsylvania,  and  North  Carolina  has  strengthened  its  Free  Elections  Clause  since  to  reinforce \nits  principal  purpose  of preserving  the  popular  sovereignty  of North  Carolinians.  The  original \nclause,  adopted  in  1776,  provided  that  “elections  of members,  to  serve  as  Representatives  in  the \nGeneral  Assembly,  ought  to  be  free.”  N.C.  Declaration  of Rights,  VI  (1776).  The  North \nCarolina  Constitution  of  1868  adopted  after  the  Civil  War,  which  initially  expanded  the  political \n31 \nUS  167134072v2\nrights  of African  Americans,  included  a  revised  Free  Elections  Clause  stating  that  “[a]//  elections \nought  to  be  free.”  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  10  (1868).  And  when North  Carolina  adopted  its  current \nconstitution  in  1971,  it  revised  the  provision  again  to  state  that  “[a]ll  elections  shall  be  free.” \nN.C.  Const.  art.  I,  §  10.  This  change  was  intended  to  “make  [it]  clear”  that  the  Free  Elections \nClause  and  the  other  rights  secured  to  the  people  by  the  Declaration  of Rights  “are  commands \nand  not  mere  admonitions”  to  proper  conduct  on  the  part  of the  government.  N.C.  State  Bar  v. \nDuMont,  304  N.C.  627,  635,  639,  286  S.E.2d  89,  97  (1982)  (internal  quotations  omitted). \n91,  In  light  of the  text  and  history  of this  provision,  a North  Carolina  court  recently \nheld  that  “the  meaning  of the  Free  Elections  Clause  is  that elections  must  be  conducted  freely \nand  honestly  to  ascertain,  fairly  and  truthfully,  the  will  of the  people.  This...  is  a  fundamental \nright  of the  citizens  enshrined  in  our  Constitution’s  Declaration  of Rights,  a  compelling \ngovernmental  interest,  and  a  cornerstone  of our  democratic  form  of government.”  Common \nCause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *110. \n92.  Citing  the  Free  Elections  Clause,  the  North  Carolina  Supreme  Court  similarly  has \nexplained  that  “[t]he  right  to  vote  is  one  of the  most  cherished  rights  in  our  system  of \ngovernment.”  Blankenship  v.  Bartlett,  363  N.C.  518  (2009)  (citing  N.C.  Const.  art.  I,  Sec.  10). \n“No  right  is  more  precious  in  a  free  country  than  that  of having  a  voice  in  the  election  of those \nwho  make  the  laws  under  which,  as  good  citizens,  we  must  live.”  Jd.  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted)). \n93.  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute,  which  indiscriminately  denies \nthe  right  to  vote  to  all  people  with  felony  convictions  even  after  their  release,  until  they  receive \nan  “unconditional  discharge[]”  from  probation  or  parole,  facially  violates  the  Free  Elections \nClause.  Just  like  the  King  of England’s  efforts  to  influence  elections  by  manipulating  the \nDe \nUS  167134072v2\neligible  electorate,  North  Carolina’s  statutory  scheme  prolonging  disenfranchisement  through \nprobation  or  parole,  restricts  North  Carolina’s  electorate. \n94.  In  so  doing,  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  violates  the  Free \nElection  Clause’s  guarantee  that  elections  in  North  Carolina  must  “honestly  .  .  .  ascertain,  fairly \nand  truthfully,  the  will  of the  people.”  Common  Cause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *2.  The  statute \ndenies  the  right  to  vote  to  roughly  70,000  North  Carolina voting-age  citizens  who  are  currently \nliving  in North  Carolina  communities  on  some  form  of probation  or  post-release  supervision. \nParticularly  given  the  razor-thin  margins  of many  North  Carolina  elections,  the \ndisenfranchisement  statute  prevents  the  “will  of the  people—the  majority”  from  prevailing.  Id. \nat  300  (emphasis  added)  (quoting  State  ex  rel.  Quinn  v.  Lattimore,  120  N.C.  426,  428,  26  S.E. \n638,  638  (1897)). \n95.  The  disenfranchisement  statute’s  requirement  that  people  released  from \nincarceration  pay  all  financial  obligations  before  regaining  the  right  to  vote  is  an  especially \npernicious  violation  of the  Free  Elections  Clause.  Elections  in  North  Carolina  are  not  free  when \nvoting  is  conditioned  on  some  people’s  ability  to  make  financial  payments. \n96.  Although  the  North  Carolina  Constitution  authorizes  the  General  Assembly  to \nregulate  rights  restoration  for people  with  felony  convictions,  the  General  Assembly’s  rights \nrestoration  statutes  must  comply  with North  Carolina  law,  including  other  provisions  of the \nNorth  Carolina  Constitution.  By  continuing  disenfranchisement through  probation  or  parole,  the \nGeneral  Assembly’s  scheme  violates  the  Free  Elections  Clause. \nCOUNT  TWO \nViolation  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution’s \nEqual  Protection  Clause,  Art.

The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution  guarantees  to  all \nNorth  Carolinians  that  “[n]o  person  shall  be  denied  the  equal  protection  of the  laws.”  N.C. \nConst.,  art.  I,  §  19. \n99.  This  provision  provides  for  greater  protections  than  its  federal  counterpart.  In \nparticular,  North  Carolina’s  Equal  Protection  Clause  protects  the  right  to  “substantially  equal \nvoting  power.”  Stephenson,  355  N.C.  at  379.  “It  is  well  settled  in  this  State  that  the  right to  vote \non  equal  terms  is  a  fundamental  right.”  Jd.  at  378  (emphasis  added). \n100.  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  violates  the  Equal  Protection \nClause  in  three  distinct  ways. \n101.  First,  the  statute  deprives  all  people  with  past  felony  convictions  subject to \nprobation  or  parole  of “substantially  equal  voting  power”—indeed,  of any  “voting  power”  at  all. \n102.  Second,  the  statute  has  the  intent  and  effect  of discriminating  against  African \nAmericans.  The  continued  disenfranchisement  of people  with  felony  convictions  through \nprobation  or  parole,  even  after  their  release,  disproportionately  impacts  African  Americans  and \ndeprives  the  African  American  community  of “substantially  equal  voting  power.” \n103.  Third,  in  conditioning  the  right  to  vote  on  the  ability  to  make  financial  payments, \nthe  statute  creates  an  impermissible  class-based  classification. \n104.  Strict  scrutiny  applies  to  each  of these  classifications.  Defendants  cannot  provide \nany  legitimate  government  interest—let  alone  a  compelling  government  interest—in  denying  the \nright to  vote  to  all  people  with  felony  convictions  until  they  are  discharged  from  probation  or \nparole.  There  is  no  legitimate justification  for  denying  the  right  to  vote  to  upwards  of 70,000 \ncitizens  who  are  living  amongst  society  and  whose  lives  will  be  governed  by  the  laws  enacted \nand  enforced  by  elected  officials.  Nor  is North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute \n34 \nUS  167134072v2\nnarrowly  tailored  to  any  conceivable  government  interest.  The  statute  indiscriminately \ndisenfranchises  all  people  with  felony  convictions  until  they  complete  probation  or  parole. \n105.  Although  the  North  Carolina  Constitution  authorizes  the  General  Assembly  to \nregulate  rights  restoration  for people  with  felony  convictions,  the  General  Assembly’s  rights \nrestoration  statutes  must  comply  with North  Carolina  law,  including  other provisions  of the \nNorth  Carolina  Constitution.  By  continuing  disenfranchisement  through  probation  or  parole, \neven beyond  releasee  the  General  Assembly’s  scheme  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause. \nCOUNT  THREE \nViolation  of North  Carolina  Constitution’s \nFreedom  of Speech  and  Assembly  Clauses,  Art.  I,  §§  12  &  14 \n106.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  all  other  paragraphs  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \n107.  Article  I,  Section  12  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution  provides  that  “[t]he \npeople  have a  right  to  assemble  together to  consult  for  their  common  good,  to  instruct  their \nrepresentatives,  and  to  apply  to  the  General  Assembly  for  redress  of grievances.” \n108.  Article  I,  Section  14  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution  provides  that  “[f]reedom \nof speech  and  of the  press  are  two  of the  great  bulwarks  of liberty  and  therefore  shall  never  be \nrestrained.” \n109.  These  provisions  provide  broader  rights  than  do  their  counterparts  in  the  U.S. \nconstitution.  Common  Cause,  2019  WL  4569584,  at  *118. \n110.  “[V]oting  for  the  candidate  of one’s  choice  and  associating  with  the  political  party \nof one’s  choice  are  core  means  of political  expression  protected  by  the  North  Carolina \nConstitution’s  Freedom  of Speech  and  Freedom  of Assembly  Clauses.”  Jd.  at  119.  “Voting \nprovides  citizens  a  direct  means  of expressing  support  for  a  candidate  and  his  views.”  Id. \n111.  North  Carolina’s  disenfranchisement  statute  constitutes  an  outright  ban  on  “core \n...  political  expression.”  Jd.  The  statute  denies  tens  of thousands  of North  Carolina  citizens  of \n35 \nUS  167134072v2\nthe  most  “direct  means”  that  exists  of “expressing  support  for  a  candidate  and  his  views.”  Id. \nThe  statute  is  no  different  from  a  law that  prevents  people  with  felony  convictions  from  giving  a \nspeech  about  matters  of public  importance  in  the  town  square. \n112.  Because  the  disenfranchisement  statute  prohibits  protected  expression  and \nassociation  for  people  released  from  incarceration,  strict  scrutiny  applies.  Defendants  cannot \nprovide  any  legitimate  government  interest—let  alone  any  compelling  government  interest—in \ndenying  people  the  right  to  vote  until  they  complete  probation  or  parole.  There  is  no  legitimate \njustification  for  denying  the  right to  vote  of 70,000  citizens  who  are  living  amongst  society  and \nwhose  lives  will  be  governed  by  the  laws  enacted  and  enforced  by  elected  officials.  Nor  is  North \nCarolina’s  disenfranchisement  statute  narrowly  tailored  to  any  conceivable  government  interest. \nThe  statute  indiscriminately  disenfranchises  all  people  with  felony  convictions  until  they \ncomplete  probation  or  parole. \n113.  Although  the  North  Carolina  Constitution  authorizes  the  General  Assembly  to \nregulate  rights  restoration  for people  with  felony  convictions,  the  General  Assembly’s  rights \nrestoration  statutes  must  comply  with North  Carolina  law,  including  other provisions  of the \nNorth  Carolina  Constitution.  By  continuing  disenfranchisement  through  probation,  parole,  or \npost-release  supervision,  beyond  release,  the  General  Assembly’s  scheme  violates  the  Freedom \nof Speech  and  Assembly  Clauses. \nCOUNT  FOUR \nViolation  of North  Carolina  Constitution’s \nBan  on  Property  Qualifications,  Art.  I,  §  11 \n114.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  all  other  paragraphs  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \n115.  Article  I,  Section  11  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution  provides  that  “[a]s \npolitical  rights  and  privileges  are  not  dependent  upon  or  modified  by  property,  no  property \nqualification  shall  affect  the  right  to  vote  or  hold  office.” \n36 \nUS  167134072v2\n116.  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  violates  this  provision  by \nconditioning  the  right  to  vote  on  whether  people  have  a  type  of property—money.  E.g.,  Reiter  v. \nSonotone  Corp.,  442  U.S.  330,  338  (1979)  (“Money,  of course,  is  a  form  of property.”).  The \nstatute  conditions  the  right  to  vote  on  a  person’s  ability  to  pay  court  costs  and  fees.  It  provides \nthat  a  person  convicted  of a  felony  shall  have  their  citizenship  rights  restored  only  upon  their \n“unconditional  discharge”  from  probation.  N.C.G.S.  §  13-1(1).  If the  person  fails  to  “[p]Jay  the \ncosts  of court,  any  fine  ordered  by  the  court,  and  make  restitution  or  reparation,”  N.C.G.S.  § \n15A-1343(b)(9),  he  or  she  has  committed  a  “violation  of a  condition  of probation”  that \nauthorizes  the  court  to  extend  the  term  of probation—and  thus  the  denial  of the  right  to  vote—to \nas  much  as  five  years.  N.C.G.S.  §§  15A-1342(a),  15A-1344(a),  (d).  North  Carolinians  who \nhave  otherwise  completed  the  terms  of their  probation  are  routinely  subjected  to  extended \nprobation—and  thus  extended  disenfranchisement—for  failing  to  pay  court  fees.  Indeed,  while \nprobation  may  not  be  revoked  based  on  nonpayment  of costs  when  poverty  prevents  that  person \nfrom  paying  the  costs,  State  v.  Robinson,  248  N.C.  282,  103  S.E.2d  376  (1958),  the  inability  to \npay  provides  no  relief from  the  continuation  or  extension  of probation.  An  individual  on \nprobation  must  pay  these  financial  obligations  in  order regain  the  right  to  vote,  rendering  these \nobligations  the  functional  equivalent  of a poll  tax. \n117.  Because  North  Carolina’s  felony  disenfranchisement  statute  makes  re- \nenfranchisement  “dependent”  on  whether  an  individual  has  sufficient  money  to  pay  court  costs, \nfees,  and  restitution,  the  statute  violates  the  ban  on  property  qualifications  set  forth  in  Article  I,  § \n11  of the  North  Carolina  Constitution. \n37 \nUS  167134072v2\nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  this  Honorable  Court  enter judgment \nin  their  favor  and  against  Defendants,  and; \nDeclare  that  N.C.G.S.  §  13-1’s  disenfranchisement  of individuals  while  on \na. \nprobation,  parole,  or  suspended  sentence  is  facially  unconstitutional  and  invalid \nunder  the  North  Carolina’s  Constitution’s  Free  Elections  Clause,  Art.  I,  §  10; \nEqual  Protection  Clause,  Art.  I,  §  19;  the  Freedom  of Speech  and  Freedom  of \nAssembly  Clauses,  Art.  I,  §§  12  &  14;  and  the  Ban  on  Property  Qualifications, \nArt.  I,  §  11. \nEnjoin  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  from  preventing  North \nCarolina  citizens  released  from  incarceration  or  not  sentenced  to  incarceration \nfrom  registering  to  vote  and  exercising  the  right  to  vote  based  on  their  felony \nconviction. \nEnjoin  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  from  conditioning \nrestoration  of the  right  to  vote  on  payment  of any  financial  obligation. \nRequire  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  to  notify  all  people \nwith  past  felony  convictions  who  have  already  been  released  from  incarceration \nor  are  released  from  incarceration  in  the  future  that  their  right  to  vote  was  restored \nupon  release  from  incarceration  or  upon  not  being  placed  under  community \nsupervision  and  that  they  may  lawfully  register  to  vote  and  vote  in  North  Carolina \nelections. \nRequire  Defendants,  their  agents,  officers,  and  employees  to  engage  in  and  take \nsuch  additional  steps  as  this  Court  deems just  and  appropriate  to  ensure  that \n38\nUS  167134072v2 \naffected  citizens  are  informed  of their  restored  rights  and  are  able  to  register  to \nvote  and  vote  in  North  Carolina  elections. \nf.
