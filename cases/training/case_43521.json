          "description": "ORDER: After reviewing the parties' submissions and applicable law, notably the Statement of Interest submitted by the United States, the Court rules that a public entity's provision and maintenance of sidewalks is a covered \"service, program, or activity\" under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The Court is persuaded by the reasoning in Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011) and Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002), which thoroughly explain why this ruling is supported by the statute's plain language and its implementing regulations. See also 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.104; 35.150(d)(2); 28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. B at § 35.150. Finally, the Court highlights that recent district court decisions have also found that sidewalks are covered services under Title II of the ADA. See American Council of the Blind of the City of New York v. City of New York, Civil No. 18-5792 (PAE), 2020 WL 6151251 (S.D.N.Y. 2020); Hamer v. City of Trinidad, 441 F. Supp. 3d 1155 (D. Colo. 2020); Mote v. City of Chelsea, 252 F. Supp. 3d 642 (E.D. Mich. 2017). The undersigning judge firmly decides that: \"[a]ny sensible reading of ADA Title II compels the conclusion that maintaining public pedestrian thoroughfares for citizens to get around a city - and access the many public services and businesses located within - is the archetypal example of the most fundamental of public services.\" Mote, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 655. Accordingly, Defendant is hereby ordered to answer the Amended Complaint at Docket No. 11 by December 10, 2020. Signed by Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi on 11/12/2020.

          "description": "ORDER denying 54 MOTION to Strike Gonzlez-Rivera's Motion Opposing the MSJ's Emergency Motion for Consolidation; and denying 51 Emergency MOTION to Consolidate Cases. In deciding whether to consolidate two cases, a Court must first determine \"whether the two proceedings involve a common party and common issues of fact or law. Once this determination is made, the trial court has broad discretion in weighing the costs and benefits of consolidation to decide whether that procedure is appropriate. A motion for consolidation will usually be granted unless the party opposing it can show 'demonstrable prejudice.'\" Seguro de Servicio de Salud de Puerto Rico v. McAuto Sys. Grp., Inc., 878 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1989)). While the two cases involve the Municipality of San Juan and share claims pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, the Court finds Plaintiffs would suffer a demonstrable prejudice if the case were consolidated with Civil No. 21- 01537. Both cases involve different plaintiffs, different issues, and find themselves at different stages of litigation. While both sets of plaintiffs are \"individuals with mobility-related disabilities\", Docket No. 55 at 3, and both cases implicate the same laws, the maintenance of public sidewalks and the design, construction, and operating of a coliseum are wholly different issues. As such, consolidating both cases would be prejudicial to the plaintiffs in both cases. Signed by Judge Jay A. Garcia-Gregory on 6/17/2022. (ERC) (Entered: 06/17/2022)"

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a lack of accessible curb ramps in the City of San Juan for people with mobility disabilities. On September 6, 2019, four individuals seeking to represent a class of people with mobility disabilities who used or would use the pedestrian right of way in San Juan filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The plaintiffs sued the City of San Juan under the Americans with Disabilities Act (&ldquo;ADA&rdquo;) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 &nbsp;(&ldquo;Section 504&rdquo;). Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys&rsquo; fees. The plaintiffs asked the court to issue a permanent injunction requiring the City to cure past violations of the ADA and Section 504 by constructing and altering ramps as necessary to ensure that they complied with those statutes. The plaintiffs alleged that by not providing accessible curb ramps and by not remediating and repairing current ramps, the City had discriminated against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs further alleged that the City had engaged in discrimination by allowing numerous parts of the city to be inaccessible to people with mobility disabilities. The case was assigned to Judge Gustavo A. Gelpi.</p>\r\n<p>The City moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on November 14, 2019. On December 5, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two named plaintiffs, as well as details about specific occurrences when a lack of proper sidewalks served as a barrier to plaintiffs accessing facilities like government buildings and medical services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The City moved to dismiss the amended complaint on December 27, 2019. The City argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue because they had not shown an injury-in-fact or harm that could be traced to the conduct of the City. The City also argued that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because they had not established exclusion from participation in or denial of the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 1, 2020, the court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs had standing and had sufficiently stated a claim under which relief could be granted. The plaintiffs had shown injury-in-fact through the lack of accessibility to sidewalks which denied them access to accommodations and services available to the general public. The court further found that the plaintiffs had standing through the ADA and Section 504, as it was not disputed that they were individuals with disabilities. The court noted, however, that the question of whether sidewalks were considered &ldquo;services&rdquo; under Title II of the ADA required further briefing. Under Title II, the plaintiffs would need to prove that they were either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of some public entity&rsquo;s services, programs, or activities or were otherwise discriminated against. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. &sect; 12132. The court ordered the parties to provide further memoranda regarding the issue. 2020 WL 5221713.</p>\r\n<p>On November 12, 2020, after further briefing by the parties, the court resolved the contested \"services\" issue. The court reviewed the statements provided by the parties, as well as a statement of interest submitted by the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice. The DOJ statement laid out the United States&rsquo; interest in ensuring that the ADA was properly enforced and explained its long-held position that sidewalks qualify as a service, program, or activity under the ADA. Based on the arguments and precedent finding that sidewalks were covered services under the statute, the court found that a public entity's provision and maintenance of sidewalks is a covered \"service, program, or activity\" under Title II.&nbsp;<em>See <a href=\"../../../../case/43912\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mote v. City of Chelsea</a></em>, 252 F. Supp. 3d 642, 655 (E.D. Mich. 2017) (&ldquo;[any] sensible reading of ADA Title II compels the conclusion that maintaining public pedestrian thoroughfares for citizens to get around a city&mdash;and access the many public services and businesses located within&mdash;is the archetypal example of the most fundamental of public services&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>On December 2, 2020, the court stayed all proceedings in the case until January 15, 2021 because a new municipal government was scheduled to be sworn in in January of 2021. The court said it was \"important that the new Municipal government [had] an opportunity to evaluate the case.\" The court urged the parties to seek settlement once the stay concluded.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 12, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting court ordered mediation in response<strong> </strong>to the court's December 2, 2020 order. The court granted the motion, stayed all other deadlines, and referred the case to Magistrate Judge Giselle Lopez-Soler for mediation. The first mediation session was held on May 21, 2021. The United States was ordered to attend the mediation session in order to discuss its previously submitted statement of interest. Another mediation session was held a month later, after which the parties were ordered to file a status report regarding the outcome of the City&rsquo;s efforts to engage a contractor specializing in ADA compliance and to retain an ADA coordinator. At the next mediation session, a schedule was set for the plaintiffs to submit a settlement demand. On November 3, 2021, the case was reassigned to Judge Jay A. Garcia-Gregory after Judge Gelpi was appointed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Further mediation hearings were held in November and December of 2021 as well as in March, June, and July of 2022.</p>\r\n<p>On May 27, 2022, the parties filed a joint motion to lift the stay as they had been unable to reach a settlement and the City had rejected the plaintiffs' proposed settlement agreement. The United States requested to participate in the hearing on the joint motion. Because neither party had objected to the United States&rsquo; participation thus far, the court allowed the request to participate in the hearing and further mediation. On June 8, 2022, the court denied the motion to lift the stay. At a mediation session the following day, the parties notified the court that they had been able to work through their impasse and that mediation would continue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 9, 2022, the City moved for sanctions after the plaintiffs' attorney failed to attend a mediation meeting that had already been rescheduled because of a request by the plaintiffs' attorney.</p>\r\n<p>On September 12, 2022, the United States formally moved to intervene as a plaintiff, which the court granted on the same day. In its intervenor complaint, the federal government asserted that the plaintiffs could not properly represent their interests as the federal government represented the public interest and any remedial plan the parties agreed on would impact the United States&rsquo; responsibility in ensuring that the relevant statutes were properly enforced. The United States further noted that the USDOT Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) had also investigated the sidewalks in a specific San Juan neighborhood after receiving a complaint alleging violations of accessibility issues with pedestrian rights-of-way submitted to the DOJ in April of 2017. The FHWA had issued a Letter of Findings in March of 2019 detailing numerous violations which they tried to reconcile with the City over the course of three years. &nbsp;In March of 2022, FHWA referred its findings of noncompliance to the United States for appropriate action. The United States then conducted its own investigation of the City's sidewalk system and found many violations of the relevant statutes. The United States sought to intervene in this case in order to properly address the FHWA's findings and to ensure that Title II of the ADA and Section 504 would be properly enforced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of December 6, 2022, the case was ongoing with the parties still engaged in mediation.&nbsp;</p>",

Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1-4, \n11, ECF No. 11.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of themselves and all \nother persons with mobility disabilities who live in, work in, or visit San Juan and seek to use the \nCity’s pedestrian rights-of-way.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 21.  Specifically, Plaintiffs ask that the Court order San \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 89   Filed 09/12/22   Page 4 of 12\n \nJuan to cure existing violations and adopt remedial measures and other policies and practices that \nensure that the City’s sidewalks are readily accessible to and useable by individuals with \ndisabilities.  Id., Prayer for Relief ¶ B.   \nThe United States’ complaint in intervention, attached as Exhibit A, alleges similar \nviolations and seeks similar declaratory and injunctive relief.  As outlined in greater detail in the \nComplaint, the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration \n(FHWA) investigated the accessibility of pedestrian walkways in the El Vedado neighborhood of \nSan Juan based on a complaint received from a resident of that neighborhood in 2017.  Ex. A \n¶¶ 21-22.  In March 2019, FHWA issued a Letter of Findings (LOF) to San Juan, detailing \nnumerous violations of Section 504 and Title II of the ADA.  Id. ¶ 22.  These included \nnoncompliant or missing curb ramps, physical barriers such as utility poles that obstructed \npedestrian walkways, and vehicles parked on sidewalks in front of homes and businesses \ncompletely blocking the path of travel.  See 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.133(a), .149–150.  Id.  FHWA also \nfound that San Juan had violated ADA programmatic requirements, including that the City \nappoint an ADA coordinator, provide a public notice of its ADA obligations, and adopt an ADA \ngrievance procedure.  See 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.106–.107.  Id. ¶ 23. \nFHWA’s LOF required that San Juan enact various remedial measures to address the \nviolations identified.  Id.  FHWA then spent nearly three years attempting to secure the City’s \nvoluntary compliance with its demands.  Id. ¶ 24.  On March 24, 2022, FHWA determined that \nits conciliation efforts had failed and referred its noncompliance findings to the United States \nDepartment of Justice to take appropriate enforcement action.  Id. ¶¶ 26-27.  See 28 C.F.R. \n35.174; 49 C.F.R. § 27.125.  The Department of Justice subsequently conducted additional \ninvestigation which confirmed that the accessibility barriers identified by the FHWA in the El \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 89   Filed 09/12/22   Page 5 of 12\nVedado neighborhood are substantial and widespread throughout the City.  Id. ¶¶ 28-33.  As a \nresult, the United States seeks to intervene in this matter, and to file the attached complaint in \nintervention seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, in order to ensure that San Juan complies \nwith Title II and Section 504 and takes necessary remedial measures to make its public sidewalk \nsystem accessible to individuals with disabilities.  \nThe United States moves to intervene as of right, pursuant to Rule 24(a), because the \nDepartment of Justice, as the federal agency charged with enforcing and implementing Title II of \nthe ADA, has a significant protectable interest in ensuring the ADA is properly and uniformly \nenforced.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a); 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2)-(3).  Alternatively, the United \nStates requests the Court’s permission to intervene, pursuant to Rule 24(b), because the United \nStates’ claims against San Juan involve questions of law and fact that are common to the claims \nbrought by the Plaintiffs, and because resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims involves the interpretation \nof statutes that the United States Attorney General is entrusted by Congress to administer.  Fed. \nR.Civ. P. 24(b)(1)-(2).  Counsel for both parties consent to the United States’ intervention.\nI. ARGUMENT\nThe United States satisfies the criteria for intervention as of right, under Rule 24(a), and\npermissive intervention, under Rule 24(b), and should be permitted to intervene on either basis. \nA. The United States May Intervene as of Right\nTo intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a), a movant must establish that: (1) their \nmotion is timely; (2) they have an interest in the property or transaction that is the subject of the \naction; (3) disposition of the action realistically threatens their ability to protect that interest; and \n(4)their position is not adequately represented by an existing party.  Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v.\nSistema de Retiro de los Empleados del Gobierno y la Judicatura, 637 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 89   Filed 09/12/22   Page 6 of 12\n2011) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)).  In analyzing motions under Rule 24(a), the First Circuit has \nexplained that the “inherent imprecision of Rule 24(a)(2)’s individual elements dictates that the \nrule should be applied with an eye toward the commonsense view of the overall litigation.”  \nUngar v. Arafat, 634 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, the \nUnited States’ motion satisfies all four criteria for intervention as of right. \nFirst, the First Circuit has advised that the concept of timeliness for an intervention \npetition “is not measured, like a statute of limitations, in terms of specific units of time, but \nrather derives meaning from assessment of prejudice in the context of the particular litigation.”  \nP. R. Tel. Co., 637 F.3d at 15.  Thus, the key question here is whether the United States’ \nintervention at the current stage of litigation would prejudice the parties.  It would not.  While \nthe case has advanced past the motion to dismiss stage, the parties have not engaged in formal \ndiscovery.  Moreover, while mediation has been ongoing for more than a year, the United States \nhas been aware of and engaged in the mediation as a nonparty and, as evidenced by the parties’ \nconsent to intervention, would be welcomed as a formal participant. \nSecond, the United States has a significant interest in this litigation.  The Department of \nJustice, as the federal agency charged with enforcing and implementing Title II of the ADA, has \na strong interest in ensuring the ADA is properly and uniformly applied.  The Department of \nJustice’s protection and advancement of this interest via intervention is consistent with \nCongress’s intent to create “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities,” and to reserve a “central role” for the federal \nGovernment in enforcing the standards established in the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2)-(3).  In \nthis matter, the United States also has a specific interest in ensuring that San Juan implements \nappropriate remedial measures to address the ADA violations found by FHWA. \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 89   Filed 09/12/22   Page 7 of 12\nThird, disposition of this action could impair the United States’ ability to protect its \ninterests.  Any remedial plan agreed to or ordered that addresses the accessibility of sidewalks \nthroughout San Juan will likely impact the United States’ ability to ensure that sidewalks in San \nJuan comply with the ADA and Section 504 and that FHWA’s noncompliance findings are \nappropriately resolved.  See Daggett v. Comm. on Gov’t Ethics & Election Pracs., 172 F.3d 104, \n110–11 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that the possibility the litigation could end with an injunction \nadversely affecting intervenors’ interests was adequate to satisfy this aspect of Rule 24(a)(2)).  \nAnd, as already illustrated by the United States’ earlier filing of an SOI, how the ADA is \ninterpreted and applied in this case could affect the United States’ ability to ensure that both San \nJuan and other cities and municipalities do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities \nin how they provide and maintain their public sidewalks.   \nFourth, the Plaintiffs do not adequately represent the interests of the United States.  \n“Typically, an intervenor need only make a ‘minimal’ showing that the representation afforded \nby a named party would be inadequate.”  B. Fernandez & Hnos., Inc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc., 440 \nF.3d 541, 545-46 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S.\n528, 538 n. 10 (1972); see also Conservation L. Found. of New England, Inc. v. Mosbacher, 966 \nF.2d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 1992) (“An intervenor need only show that representation may be\ninadequate, not that it is inadequate.”).  Here, the private plaintiffs cannot adequately represent \nthe interests of the United States because the United States represents the public interest, and the \nPlaintiffs do not have the same interests or expertise that the Department of Justice possesses as \nthe agency entrusted by Congress with enforcing and implementing Title II of the ADA.  42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12101(b)(2)–(3), 12134; see Perez v. Perry, 2013 WL 5372882, at *2-5 (W.D. Tex. \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 89   Filed 09/12/22   Page 8 of 12\nSept. 24, 2013) (permitting the United States to intervene where the Attorney General was \n“charged by statute with enforcing and administering the Voting Rights Act” and any order by \nthe court could have “broad consequences for the United States and its role in administering [the \nVoting Rights Act]”); see also Heaton v. Monogram Bank of Ga., 297 F.3d 416, 424-25 (5th Cir. \n2002) (noting that “[g]overnment agencies . . . must represent the public interest” and “[i]t \ncannot be assumed that the existing [private] parties to the litigation would protect the FDIC’s \nand the public’s interest” in the proper regulation of the federal deposit insurance system).  Thus, \nwhether this matter is resolved voluntarily or through litigation, the United States’ formal \nparticipation is critical to ensure that its interests are protected and that any remedial plan for San \nJuan, a large municipality of particular importance in Puerto Rico, comports with the United \nStates’ views on the proper interpretation and application of Title II.  If intervention is denied, \nthe United States’ ability to adequately protect its interests will be impaired. \nFinally, all of the above elements evaluated through a “commonsense” view of the \nlitigation—and taking into account the parties’ consent to intervention—support the conclusion \nthat the United States should be allowed to intervene as of right. \nB. Alternatively, the United States Should be Permitted to Intervene\nWhere a party is not entitled to intervene as of right, a court may still grant permissive \nintervention under Rule 24(b).  Rule 24(b)(2) empowers the court to permit intervention on \ntimely motion by a governmental officer or agency where “a party’s claim or defense is based \non:  (A) a statute or executive order administered by the officer or agency; or (B) any regulation, \norder, requirement, or agreement issued or made under the statute or executive order.”  And Rule \n24(b)(1)(B) empowers the court to “permit anyone to intervene who . . . has a claim or defense \nthat shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.”   \n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 89   Filed 09/12/22   Page 9 of 12\nHere, the United States’ intervention falls squarely within Rule 24(b)(2).  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24 advisory committee’s note (explaining that subsection (b) was amended in 1946 to \ninclude explicit reference to governmental agencies and officers in order to avoid exclusionary \nconstruction of the rule, and citing, with approval, cases in which governmental entities were \npermitted to intervene); see also 7C CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, FED. PRAC.\n& PROC. CIV. § 1912 (3d ed.) (noting that courts have allowed intervention liberally to \ngovernment agencies and collecting cases).  As discussed above, the Department of Justice is the \nfederal agency that administers and enforces the ADA and Section 504, and issues the ADA’s \nimplementing regulations, and here the parties’ claims and defenses entirely concern the \napplication and enforcement of Title II and Section 504.  See Halderman v. Pennhurst State Sch. \n& Hosp., 612 F.2d 84, 92 (3d Cir. 1979) (en banc) (permitting United States to intervene based \non its enforcement of federal statute and regulations protecting individuals with developmental \nand cognitive disabilities), rev’d on other grounds, 451 U.S. 1.  Additionally, the United States’ \nmotion is timely and does not unduly delay the proceedings or prejudice the original parties.  On \nthe contrary, the United States anticipates its participation will help facilitate an appropriate and \nefficient resolution of this matter.  \nThe United States also satisfies Rule 24(b)(1)(B) because the proposed complaint in \nintervention implicates several questions of fact and law that are common to the claims already \nbrought by the Plaintiffs.  Indeed, the most essential question—whether San Juan has failed to \nprovide and maintain an accessible public sidewalk system thereby discriminating against people \nwith mobility disabilities —is identical.   \n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 89   Filed 09/12/22   Page 10 of 12\nII. CONCLUSION\nFor all of the above reasons, the United States respectfully requests that the Court grant\nthe United States’ motion to intervene. \nRespectfully submitted, \nW. STEPHEN MULDROW ANNE S.

CASE NO. 19-1837  (GAG) \n6 \nCITY OF SAN JUAN, a public entity also   \n7  known as the Municipality of San Juan,   \n \nDefendant. \n8   \n \n9  OPINION AND ORDER \n10  On September 6, 2019, Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colón (“Plaintiff Betancourt-Colón”), \n11  Virgen Negrón-Villegas (“Plaintiff Negrón-Villegas”), Minor A.V.R. (“Plaintiff Minor A.V.R.”), \n12  represented by her mother Widallys Rivera Quiñones, and William Rodriguez Burgos (Plaintiff \n13  Rodríguez”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the above-captioned action against the City of San \n14  Juan  (“Municipality”  or  “Defendant”),  seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  under  the \n15  Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 and Section 504 of the \n16  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 794, et seq. (Docket Nos. 1; 11).1 \n17  Plaintiffs bring this action individually, and on behalf of all persons with mobility disabilities who \n18  use or will use the pedestrian right of way in the City of San Juan, as a class action under Rule \n19  23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.2 See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2). \n20 \n21 \n \n22 \n1 Defendant moved to dismiss the original complaint at Docket No. 1. See (Docket No. 10). Nonetheless, Plaintiffs \namended the Complaint at Docket No. 11. Defendants, subsequently, filed a motion to dismiss the Amended \n23  Complaint. See (Docket No. 14). The latter is under the Court’s advisement in this Opinion and Order, while the \nformer is hereby deemed MOOT. \n24  2 The Municipality of San Juan does not argue that any Rule 23(a) requirements were not met. \n1  \n25 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 2 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  Defendants move to dismiss the Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, \n2  pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1), and  for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \n3  granted, pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). (Docket No. 14). Defendant avers that all Plaintiffs \n4  failed to demonstrate an “injury in fact” or a “concrete and particularized” harm that can be “fairly \n5  traceable” to the challenged conduct of the Municipality and, thus, lack standing to sue. Id at 23. \n6  Furthermore, it claims that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because \n7  they have not established how they have been excluded from participation, or have been denied, \n8  the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity. Id at 13. \n9  After a careful review of the parties’ submissions and pertinent law, the Court DENIES \n10  Defendant’s motion to dismiss at Docket No. 14. \n11  I.  Relevant Factual Background3 \n12  Plaintiffs  filed  suit  against  the  Municipality  seeking  to  redress  its  alleged  systemic, \n13  pervasive,  and  continuing  policy,  pattern,  or  practice  of  unlawfully  discriminating  against \n14  individuals with mobility disabilities. (Docket No. 11 ¶ 1).Plaintiffs argue that the Municipality has \n15  failed, and continues to fail, in installing and maintaining curb ramps necessary to make its \n16  pedestrian right-of-way readily accessible to people with mobility disabilities. Id. Furthermore, \n17  Plaintiffs allege the Municipality has failed to comply with its obligation to install and/or remediate \n18  curb ramps when it alters or constructs new streets, bus stops, and sidewalks. Id.  \n19  Plaintiff Betancourt-Colón lives and works as a volunteer community leader in San Juan, \n20  Puerto Rico. Id. ¶ 17. Plaintiff Betancourt-Colón has a mobility disability that substantially limits \n21  his ability to walk, and frequently uses a wheelchair and scooter for mobility to move. Id. He \n22 \n \n23  3  For purposes of the motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all the factual allegations in the Complaint and \nconstrues all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff. See Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, \n24  16 (1st Cir. 1998). \n25 \n2 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 3 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  encounters many barriers to accessibility, particularly in the San Juan City Hospital area. (Docket \n2  No. 11 ¶ 38). For example, he alleges that along Paseo José Celso Barbosa there are street \n3  intersections with no curb ramps and, along Paseo José Celso Barbosa and Centro Médico Avenue, \n4  almost all ramps at the street intersections have “inaccessible” curb ramps at each corner. Id. \n5  Plaintiff also directly encountered the barriers described above on August 5, 2019, among others. \n6  Id. ¶ 41. For example, on August 5, 2019, he approached an “inaccessible” curb ramp in front of \n7  the Municipality of San Juan building and determined, at the time, that using that sidewalk would \n8  pose an unnecessary risk to his safety. Id.  \n9  Plaintiff Negrón-Villegas lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 11 ¶ 18). Plaintiff \n10  Negrón-Villegas has a mobility disability, she cannot walk. Id. She uses a wheelchair for mobility \n11  due to her condition of spina bifida. Id. Plaintiff Negrón-Villegas lives at the Los Lirios Public \n12  Housing in Cupey sector in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Id. ¶ 47. She has encountered numerous barriers \n13  to have full and equal use of the pedestrian right-of-way in her community and throughout the \n14  City. Id. Plaintiff Negrón-Villegas directly encountered the barriers described above on August 5, \n15  2019. Id. ¶ 51. \n16  Plaintiff Minor A.V.R. lives in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico, and has a mobility disability and \n17  cannot walk; she uses a wheelchair for mobility due to her conditions of spina bifida and cerebral \n18  palsy. (Docket No. 11 ¶ 19). Minor A.V.R. has also encountered numerous obstacles to using \n19  portions of the pedestrian right of way throughout the City, particularly in areas near her doctors’ \n20  offices . Id. ¶ 52. Minor A.V.R. further was faced with streets without curb ramps and barriers in \n21  Old San Juan on October, 2019 and during her last visit to a doctor in the City on August, 2019. Id. \n22  ¶ 52-53. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n3 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 4 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  Plaintiff Rodríguez lives in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico and frequently visits San Juan area for \n2  medical appointments and as a local tourist. (Docket No. 11 ¶ 20). Plaintiff Rodríguez has a mobility \n3  disability, multiple sclerosis that substantially limits his ability to walk. Id. On September 1, 2019, \n4  he was deterred from visiting Old San Juan because of the many inaccessible sidewalks in the area. \n5  Id. ¶ 42. Plaintiff Rodríguez is often deterred from visiting San Juan because the inaccessible \n6  sidewalks represent a treat to his safety. Id. Based on Plaintiff Rodríguez’ direct observations, he \n7  is now continuously aware that he will face architectural barriers, such as inexistent curb ramps. Id. \n8  ¶ 44.  \n9  Finally, the Plaintiff class consists of all persons with mobility disabilities within the \n10  meaning of all applicable statutes and regulations, including 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), 28 C.F.R. § \n11  35.104, 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B), who use or will use the pedestrian right of way in the Municipality \n12  of San Juan through the date of judgment in this action. (Docket No. 11 ¶ 17-21). Plaintiffs \n13  collectively argue that these experiences are typical for persons with mobility disabilities that seek \n14  to patrol the City. Id. ¶ 57. They put forward that this reality demonstrates the inaccessibility, fear, \n15  humiliation, and isolation that people with mobility disabilities experience while trying to navigate \n16  the City’s pedestrian right of way. Id.  \n17  II.  Standard of Review \n18  Under FRCP 12(b) (1) a party may assert the defenses of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, \n19  Fed.R.Civ.P.12(b)(1). This rule is a large umbrella, overspreading a variety of diverse types of \n20  challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction. Valentín v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 362-63 (1st \n21  Civil No. 18-1012 (GAG) (1st Cir. 2001). Once a jurisdictional challenge has been raised under \n22  FRCP 12(b)(1), Plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of the Court's jurisdiction. Puerto Rico Tel. \n23  v. Telecom. Regulatory Bd., 189 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1999).  \n24 \n25 \n4 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 5 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  Standing is a “threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of the court \n2  to entertain the suit.” New Hampshire Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, \n3  12 (1st Cir. 1996). The courts must dismiss the action if it determines at any time that it lacks \n4  subject-matter jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P.12(h)(3). Motions brought under Rule 12(b)(1) are subject \n5  to the same standard of review as Rule 12(b)(6). Negrón-Gaztambide v. Hernández-Torres, 35 F.3d \n6  25, 27 (1st Cir. 1994). \n7  When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \n8  granted, see FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6), the Court analyzes the complaint in a two-step process under \n9  the current context-based “plausibility” standard established by the Supreme Court. See Schatz v. \n10  Republican State Leadership Comm., 669 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing Ocasio-Hernández v. \n11  Fortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011) which discusses Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 \n12  (2009) and Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)). First, the Court must “isolate and \n13  ignore statements in the complaint that simply offer legal labels and conclusions or merely rehash \n14  cause-of-action  elements.”  Id.  A  complaint  does  not  need  detailed  factual  allegations,  but \n15  “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, \n16  do not suffice.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. Second, the Court must then “take the complaint’s well-\n17  pled (i.e., non-conclusory, non-speculative) facts as true, drawing all reasonable inferences in the \n18  pleader’s favor, and see if they plausibly narrate a claim for relief.” Schatz, 669 F.3d at 55. Plausible, \n19  means something more than merely possible, and gauging a pleaded situation’s plausibility is a \n20  context-specific job that compels the Court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. \n21  Id. (citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79). This “simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable \n22  expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of” the necessary element. Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n23  556.  \n24 \n25 \n5 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 6 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility \n2  of misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not ‘show[n]’-’that the pleader is entitled to \n3  relief.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2)). If, however, the “factual content, \n4  so taken, ‘allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \n5  misconduct alleged,’ the claim has facial plausibility.” Ocasio-Hernández, 640 F.3d at 12 (quoting \n6  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). In ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court must accept as true all the factual \n7  allegations in the complaint and construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs. See \n8  Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).  \n9  III.  Legal Analysis \n10  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs lack standing in the present case. (Docket No. 14 at 23). \n11  Additionally, the Municipality claims that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief \n12  can be granted regarding because they have not been excluded from participation and benefits of \n13  the services, programs or activities of a public entity. (Docket No. 14 at 13).  \n14  A. Standing \n15  Article III of the United States Constitution imposes a “case or controversy” limitation on \n16  federal jurisdiction. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540 (2016). The “case or controversy” \n17  limitation requires that a party invoking federal jurisdiction have standing that is a personal stake \n18  in  the  outcome.  Warth  v.  Seldin,  422  U.S.  490,  499  (1975).  Constitutional  and  prudential \n19  considerations comprise the standing requirement. Id. To satisfy the constitutional component, the \n20  party invoking federal jurisdiction must demonstrate that: (1) they have suffered some actual or \n21  threatened injury as a result of the challenged conduct; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the \n22  defendant’s challenged conduct; and (3) a favorable decision from the court will likely redress the \n23  injury. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); Council of Ins. Agents & \n24 \n25 \n6 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 7 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  Brokers v. Juarbe-Jiménez, 443 F.3d 103, 108-09 (1st Cir. 2006). Prudential limitations include \n2  “the general prohibition on a litigant’s raising another person’s legal rights, the rule barring \n3  adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, \n4  and the requirement that a plaintiff’s complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law \n5  invoked.” Procurador De Personas Con Impedimentos v. Municipality of San Juan, 541 F. Supp. \n6  2d 468, 472 (D.P.R. 2008).  \n7  Plaintiffs allege  that the lack of accessible curb ramps denies individuals with mobility \n8  disabilities full, equal, and meaningful access to the pedestrian right of way, City-wide. (Docket \n9  No. 11 ¶¶ 25-35). Plaintiffs further allege that, as a result, persons with mobility disabilities have \n10  been denied access to the accommodations and services available to the general public. Id. \n11  Moreover, these barriers deter persons with mobility disabilities from exploring or visiting areas of \n12  the City. Id. Missing and inaccessible curb ramps likewise delay travel and cause persons with \n13  mobility disabilities to fear for their safety, as these conditions often create dangerous situations. \n14  Id.  These  allegations  sufficiently  demonstrate  an  injury-in-fact.  Plaintiff  allege  that  the \n15  Municipality of San Juan is responsible for providing and maintaining sidewalks satisfy the causal \n16  connection prong.  Id. ¶ 24.  \n17  Consequently, the Court finds that Plaintiffs in the present case have standing to sue. \n18  B.  Plaintiffs’ claim pleading sufficiency \n19  The ADA was created to “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the \n20  elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). \n21  Relevant to the present case, Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with \n22  disabilities by “public entities,” and is modeled on § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Pub. L. No. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n7 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 8 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (1973).4 Pursuant to Title II, a Plaintiff must prove that: (1) that he or she is a \n2  qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he or she was either excluded from participation in or \n3  denied the benefits of some public entity’s services, programs, or activities or was otherwise \n4  discriminated against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by \n5  reason of the plaintiff’s disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132;  Parker v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, \n6  225 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000). The Municipality does not dispute that Plaintiffs are qualified \n7  individuals with a disability or that it is a public entity. See Docket No. 14.  \n8  All Plaintiffs in the present case have stated that they are qualified individuals with mobility \n9  disabilities.  (Docket  No.  11  ¶¶  17-21).  Each  Plaintiff  lists  several  instances  where  the \n10  Municipality’s pedestrian right of way was not readily accessible to and usable by persons with \n11  mobility disabilities due to the Municipality’s failure to install and maintain accessible curb ramps. \n12  (Docket No. 11 ¶¶ 6; 36-61). Plaintiffs’ assert that, thereby, they and other persons with mobility \n13  disabilities must forgo participation in daily activities, including visiting public facilities, places of \n14  public accommodation, or risk injury or damage to their mobility devices by traveling on or around \n15  inaccessible portions of the pedestrian right of way. Id.  \n16  Defendant mostly argue that sidewalks are not considered services under Title II of the \n17  ADA. See Docket No. 14, at 13-19. However, at this early stage of the proceedings, Plaintiffs have \n18  correctly  pled  their  claims  under  Title  II  of  the  ADA  provided  that  the  alleged  sidewalk \n19  inefficiencies also affected their right to visit different public facilities (San Juan City Hospital, \n20  Municipality of San Juan, public housing, etc.) or attend public functions, which are indeed \n21  considered services, programs, or activities under said title. (Docket No. 11 ¶¶ 6, 36-61). See also \n22 \n \n23  4 The Court construes the ADA and Rehabilitation Act counts as presenting a single claim. See Parker v. \nUniversidad de Puerto Rico, 225 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting First Circuit relies interchangeably on ADA \n24  Title II and Rehabilitation Act Section 504 law when applying either statute). \n25 \n8 \n \n26 \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-GAG   Document 17   Filed 09/01/20   Page 9 of 9\nCivil No. 19-1837 (GAG) \n \n1  Parker, 225 F.3d 1, 5 (quoting Title II stating that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, \n2  because a public entity's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, \n3  be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \n4  of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.149.) The \n5  Court notes that whether sidewalks are indeed considered services under Title II of the ADA \n6  requires further briefing. Both parties have until October 30, 2020 to provide the Court with further \n7  simultaneous memoranda regarding this issue. \n8  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ allegations in the Amended Complaint sufficiently state a claim \n9  upon which relief can be granted under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \n10  Act. \n11  IV.  Conclusion \n12  For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant’s Motions to Dismiss at Docket \n13  No. 14.  \n14 \nSO ORDERED. \n15 \nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico this 1st day of September, 2020.  \n16 \n                  s/ Gustavo A.

This  lawsuit  is  brought  against  Defendant  to  redress  its  systemic, \npervasive,  and  continuing  policy,  pattern,  or  practice  of  unlawfully \ndiscriminating against Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals with \nmobility disabilities. As alleged further below, the City has failed and \ncontinues to fail to install and maintain curb ramps that are necessary to \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 2 of 46\nmake its pedestrian right of way readily accessible to people with mobility \ndisabilities, and to comply with its obligation to install and/or remediate \ncurb ramps when it engages in alterations or new construction of streets, \nbus stops, and sidewalks. A substantial number of the street crossings \nwithin the City’s pedestrian right of way do not comply with applicable \nstate  and  federal  regulations  addressing  accessibility  for  people  with \ndisabilities because, for example, they lack curb ramps entirely, have curb \nramps on only one side of a corner, have curb ramps that are too narrow, \ntoo steep, or too cracked, broken, or uplifted to be used by people with \nmobility disabilities. \n2.  The  City’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  is  a  fundamental  public  program, \nservice, and/or activity that the City provides for the benefit of its residents \nand visitors. Accessible curb ramps are necessary to permit people with \nmobility disabilities who use mobility aids such as wheelchairs, scooters, \ncanes, walkers, or crutches to access the City’s pedestrian right of way. \nBecause the City’s pedestrian right of way constitutes a core mode of \ntransportation, the absence of accessible curb ramps prevents people with \nmobility  disabilities  from  independently,  fully,  and  meaningfully \nparticipating in all aspects of society, including employment, housing, \neducation, transportation, public accommodations, and recreation, among \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 3 of 46\nothers. Accordingly, an accessible pedestrian right of way is essential to \nrealizing the integration mandate of disability non-discrimination laws, \nincluding the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n3.  Named Plaintiffs Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon and Virgen Negron-\nVillegas  are  two  individuals  with  mobility  disabilities  who  bring  this \naction on behalf of themselves and all persons with mobility disabilities \nwho, like Named Plaintiffs, live in, work in, or visit San Juan and are being \ndiscriminated against and subjected to unlawful or hazardous conditions \ndue to the absence of accessible curb ramps within the City’s pedestrian \nright of way. \n4.  Federal  disability  access  laws  were  enacted  to  provide  persons  with \ndisabilities an equal opportunity to participate fully in civic life. See 29 \nU.S.C. § 794 (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section \n504”));  42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a)(7)  (Americans  with  Disabilities  Act \n(“ADA”)). Under the ADA and Section 504, a public entity’s sidewalks, \ncrosswalks and paved paths—collectively referred to as a public entity’s \n“pedestrian right of way”—are a “program,” “service,” or “activity” that \nmust be readily accessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Barden v. \nCity of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002); Procurador De \nPersonas Con Impedimentos v. Municipality of San Juan, 541 F.Supp.2d \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 4 of 46\n468,  471-73  (DPR2008).  As  detailed  further  below,  Defendant  has \nexcluded  Plaintiffs  and  all  other  similarly  situated  individuals  with \nmobility disabilities from participation in or denied them the benefits of \nDefendant’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  program,  service,  or  activity,  or \nsubjected them to discrimination by: a) failing to install and remediate curb \nramps in newly-constructed or altered portions of the City’s pedestrian \nright of way; and, b) failing to install, remediate and maintain curb ramps \nwhere necessary to provide people with mobility disabilities meaningful \naccess to the City’s pedestrian right of way, when viewed in its entirety. \n5.  Both the ADA (since January 27, 1992) and Section 504 (since June 3, \n1977) have mandated that whenever a government entity newly constructs \na bus stop pad or newly constructs or alters streets, roads, or highways, it \nmust install curb ramps at any intersection having curbs or other barriers \nto entry from a street level pedestrian  walkway, to ensure that newly \nconstructed or altered pedestrian right of way programs and facilities are \nreadily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.151(a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(4)(i)(1), (b)(4)(i)(2); 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. D § \n10.2.1; 45 C.F.R. § 84.23(b); 36 C.F.R. pt. 1191, app. D § 810.2.3. The \nADA and  Section 504 also mandate that a public entity operate each \nprogram, service, or activity so that the program, service, or activity, when \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 5 of 46\nviewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a), (b)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(a), (b). \nTo the extent structural changes to facilities existing as of the effective date \nof the ADA or Section 504 are necessary to achieve this “program access” \nmandate, such changes were to have been made by no later than January \n26, 1995 under the ADA, and by no later than June 3, 1980 under Section \n504. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(c); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(d). \n6.  The City’s pedestrian right of way, when viewed in its entirety, is not \nreadily accessible to and usable by persons with mobility disabilities due \nto the City’s failure to install and  maintain accessible curb ramps. In \naddition, the City has failed to install accessible curb ramps or remediate \nexisting curb ramps as part of new construction or alterations of its streets, \nroadways, and highways. As a result, Plaintiffs and other persons with \nmobility  disabilities  must  forgo  participation  in  daily  activities  — \nincluding visiting public facilities, places of public accommodation, or \nfriends — or risk injury or damage to their mobility devices by traveling \non or around inaccessible portions of the pedestrian right of way. At times, \nPlaintiffs are able to use the pedestrian right of way, but only by taking \ncircuitous routes to avoid barriers to accessibility, which wastes their time \nand energy. As a result of the many missing and noncompliant curb ramps \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 6 of 46\nin the City, people with mobility disabilities do not have full and equal \naccess to the pedestrian right of way. \n7.  The discrimination and denial of meaningful, equal and safe access to the \nCity’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  for  persons  with  mobility  disabilities \ncomplained  of  herein  is  the  direct  result  of  Defendant’s  policies, \nprocedures,  and  practices  with  regard  to  pedestrian  walkways  and \ndisability access,  including, but not limited to the following: \ni.  The failure to install accessible curb ramps at locations where no \ncurb ramps exist, or where inaccessible curb ramps exist, within the \ntime required by applicable federal disability access laws or on any \nother reasonable schedule; \nii.  The failure to install accessible curb ramps, or remediate existing \nnoncompliant curb ramps, at street corners or sidewalks that are \nnewly constructed, resurfaced or otherwise altered; \niii.  The failure to install curb ramps at intersections in the City that are \nnecessary  to  provide  meaningful,  equal  and  safe  access  to  the \npedestrian right of way; \niv.  The  failure  to develop and  implement a  process for identifying \nintersections and corners throughout the City at which curb ramps \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 7 of 46\nare necessary to provide meaningful, equal, and safe access to the \npedestrian right of way; \nv.  The failure to adopt and utilize or require and enforce the utilization \nof a curb ramp design that complies with applicable federal and state \ndesign standards or guidelines; \nvi.  The failure to install accessible curb ramps within a reasonable time \nframe after receiving a request to do so or otherwise being notified \nof the need for an accessible curb ramp at a particular location; \nvii.  The  failure  to  adopt  or  implement  reasonable  administrative \nmethods,  policies,  and  procedures  for  inspecting,  repairing,  and \nmaintaining the pedestrian right of way, including curb ramps, as \nrequired by Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations \nincluding 28 C.F.R. § 35.133 (maintenance of accessible features); \nviii.  The failure to remediate corners with no curb ramps or with curb \nramps  that  are  not  properly  positioned  such  that  they  require \npedestrians with mobility disabilities to travel around the corner in \nthe street alongside vehicular traffic in order to access a crossing, or \ncause pedestrians with mobility disabilities to roll or fall into the \nroadway; \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 8 of 46\nix.  The  failure  to  remediate  curb  ramps  that  are  designed  and/or \nconstructed  in  a  noncompliant  manner  such  that  people  with \nmobility disabilities are denied meaningful access to the pedestrian \nright of way as a whole. These deficiencies often include one or \nmore of the following: \n1.  Running,  cross,  and  side  slopes  of  curb  ramps  that  are \nexcessively steep; \n2.  Ramps that are too narrow to accommodate wheelchairs or \nscooters; \n3.  Landings at the top of curb ramps that do not provide enough \nspace for a wheelchair to maneuver onto or off the ramp, \nforcing persons with mobility disabilities to use the much \nsteeper side flares or roll off the sidewalk entirely; \n4.  Excessive counter slopes at the bottoms of curb ramps. The \ncombination of excessive curb ramp slopes and/or gutter pan \ncounter slopes often forces wheelchair users to scrape the \npaving with their foot rests and can even bring a wheelchair \nor scooter to a full stop, creating risks of falling and injury; \nand \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 9 of 46\n5.  Lips at the bottom of curb ramps where the ramp meets the \ngutter. Such non-flush transitions create additional risks of \nscraping the pavement and/or sudden stops and possible falls \nand  injury.  Federal  access  codes  have  required  smooth \ntransitions at the base of curb ramps for several decades. \n8.  These administrative  methods, policies, and practices, or lack thereof, \ndiscriminate against persons with disabilities by denying them access to \nthe City’s pedestrian right of way. Large sections of the more than 1,000 \nmiles  of  sidewalks  within  the  City’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  are \ninaccessible to persons with mobility disabilities due to missing or faulty \ncurb ramps. Representative  and  illustrative examples of the  foregoing \ntypes of disability access barriers located throughout the City are identified \nbelow at Paragraphs 23-45 to this Complaint. \n9.  For  decades,  Defendant  has  failed  to  meet  ADA  and  Section  504 \naccessibility requirements and failed to adopt and implement systematic \nefforts to ensure that the City’s pedestrian right of way is readily accessible \nto  and  useable  by  persons  with  mobility  disabilities.  Furthermore, \nDefendant has for decades made compliance with the ADA and Section \n504  a  lower  priority  than  other  activities  and  projects,  including \ndiscretionary activities and  projects not mandated  by law. Prioritizing \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 10 of 46\ncompliance with the ADA and Section 504 in this manner also constitutes \na policy or practice that denies program access to and discriminates against \npersons  with  mobility  disabilities.  This  lawsuit  seeks  a  court  order \nrequiring Defendant to comply with these laws and to provide people with \nmobility disabilities meaningful access to the City’s pedestrian right of \nway over 29 years after the enactment of the ADA and many more years \nafter enactment of Section 504 protections. \n10.  Named Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon made efforts to resolve \nthis  dispute  without  litigation.  He  identified  multiple  deficiencies  \ninvolving the sidewalks and filed a formal complaint before the Defensoria \nde  las  Personas  con  Impedimento  (Puerto  Rico’s  state  government \nprotection and advocacy agency), complaint number 2018-060307. The \nCity of San Juan admitted the violations, according to the Defensoria, but \nthe defendant ignored its obligations under state and federal law.  \n11.  Plaintiffs thus bring this action to remedy violations of Title II of the ADA, \n42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq., and its accompanying regulations, Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq. and its accompanying \nregulations. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the \nabove statutes and an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs under \napplicable law. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 11 of 46\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, brought pursuant to \nTitle II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 to 12213 and Section 504, 29 \nU.S.C. § 794, et seq. to redress systemic civil rights violations against \npeople with mobility disabilities by the City of San Juan. \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for \nclaims arising under the ADA and Section 504. \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343 for \nclaims arising under the ADA and Section 504. \n15.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  issue  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \n16.  Venue over Plaintiffs’ claims is proper in the District of  Puerto Rico \nbecause  Defendant  resides  in  the  District  of  Puerto  Rico  within  the \nmeaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1391, and because the events, acts, and omissions \ngiving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in the District of Puerto Rico.  \nPARTIES \n \n17.  Named Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon lives and works as a \nvolunteer community leader in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Plaintiff Betancourt-\nColon has a mobility disability that substantially limits his ability to walk, \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 12 of 46\nand uses an wheelchair and scooter for mobility due to his disability. \nPlaintiff Betancourt-Colon is a “qualified person with a disability” and a \nperson with “a disability” within the meaning of all applicable statutes and \nregulations including 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 705(20)(B).  \n18.  Named Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico. \nPlaintiff Negron-Villegas has a mobility disability that substantially limits \nher ability to walk, and uses a wheelchair for mobility due to her disability. \nPlaintiff Negron-Villegas is a “qualified person with a disability” and a \nperson with “a disability” within the meaning of all applicable statutes and \nregulations including 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 705(20)(B).  \n \n19.  The Plaintiff class consists of all persons with mobility disabilities who \nuse or will use the pedestrian right of way in the City of San Juan through \nthe date of judgment in this action. \n \n20.  Hereafter, references in this document to “Plaintiffs” shall be deemed to \ninclude  the  Named  Plaintiffs  and  each  member  of  the  class,  unless \notherwise indicated. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 13 of 46\n21.  Presently, and at all times relevant to this complaint, Defendant City of \nSan Juan has been a public entity within the meaning of Title II of the ADA \nand has received federal financial assistance within the meaning of the \nRehabilitation Act sufficient to invoke its coverage. \n \n22.  The City is a local government entity with the responsibility of providing \nPlaintiffs  with  access  to  its  public  facilities,  programs,  services,  and \nactivities. The City is responsible for constructing, maintaining, repairing, \nand regulating its pedestrian right of way. \n \nFACTS APPLICABLE TO ALL CLAIMS \n \n23.  As a result of Defendant’s policies and practices with regard to curb ramps \nin the City’s pedestrian right of way, people with mobility disabilities have \nbeen discriminated against and denied full and equal access to the benefits \nof the City’s pedestrian right of way program or service. \n24.  Hereafter, an “Inaccessible” curb ramp shall refer to a curb ramp that did \nnot  comply  with  applicable  standards  for  accessible  design  (i.e.,  the \nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (“UFAS”), 1991 ADA Standards \nfor  Accessible  Design  (“ADAAG”)  or  the  2010  ADA  Standards  for \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 14 of 46\nAccessible Design (“2010 ADAAG”)), at the time it was constructed or \naltered. \n25.  Defendant  has  failed  and  is  failing  to  install,  remediate,  repair,  and \nmaintain  curb  ramps  as  required  by  law.  For  example,  thousands  of \nintersections in the City have no curb ramps or an inadequate number of \ncurb ramps. Even where curb ramps exist, many are improperly installed \nand/or maintained, lack a flush transition to the street, have excessively \nsteep running, cross, and side slopes, are too narrow, and/or are otherwise \nnoncompliant. Many other curb ramps are not maintained; they are broken, \ncracked, crumbled, sunken, and/or caved. \n26.  As a result of Defendant’s policies and practices with regard to curb ramps, \nlarge segments of the City’s pedestrian right of way do not comply with \nnew construction or alteration accessibility requirements. For example, the \nCity has consistently failed to install curb ramps and remediate existing \ncurb ramps when it alters or constructs sidewalks and streets. \n27.  As  a  result  of  the  many  missing  and  noncompliant  curb  ramps  at \nintersections throughout the City, the pedestrian right of way, viewed in its \nentirety, is inaccessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Plaintiffs and \nothers with mobility disabilities are therefore denied meaningful access to \nthe City’s pedestrian right of way, public buildings, parks, transportation, \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 15 of 46\nand/or places of employment and public accommodation, either through \ncomplete denials of access or through delay of travel or unsafe conditions. \n28.  This lack of accessible curb ramps is not isolated or limited. Rather, these \nbarriers  to full  and  equal  access  to  the  pedestrian  right  of  way  exist \nthroughout the City, thus denying individuals with mobility disabilities \nfull, equal, and meaningful access to the pedestrian right of way City-wide. \nPersons with mobility disabilities encounter missing or Inaccessible curb \nramps throughout the City, including in such areas, neigborhoods, and \nstreets  as  Cupey  Gardens,  Reparto  San  Rafael,  Ciudad  Señorial,  El \nSeñorial, Alturas de Cupey, Paseo Mayor, Paseo de Las Vistas, Paseo Las \nBrisas,  Monacillo,  La  Cumbre,  Villa  del  Alar,  San  Fernando,    Las \nAmericas, Ramon/Villa Nevarez, San Ana, University Gardens, Caparra \nTerrace,  Avenida  Central,  Avenida  Americo  Miranda,  Avenida \nDomenech, Avenida Central, Avenida Universidad, Ave Ponce de Leon, \nAvenida Eleonor Roosevelt, Hill Brothers Norte, Seburuco, Polvorín, Los \nPeñas, San Felipe, Tierra Santa, Shangai, Israel /Bitumul, Playita, Villa \nClemente, El Gandul, La Marina, Vista Alegre, Sierra Maestra, El Hoyo \nCaimito, Monacillos, Parcelas Caneja, Tortugo, Sector Julito, Morcello, \nQuebrada  Arenas,  Trastalleres,  Campo  Alegre,  Yambele, \nChícharo/Seboruco, Jurutungo, Barrio Obrero, Sector La Marina, Cantera, \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 16 of 46\nLas Monjas, Buena Vista (Hato Rey), Parada 27, Buena Vista (Santurce), \nBarrio  Obrero,  Sector  San  Ciprian,  Barrio  Obrero  Oeste,  Jardines  de \nBerwing, Balcones de San Martín, Altos del cabro, Barriada Figueroa, Hill \nBrothers Sur, Barrio Dulce, El Checo, La Perla, Villa Palmeras, Puerta de \nTierra, Buen Consejo, Barriada Venezuela, Victoria, Antigua Via El Hoyo \nI,  Barriada Borinquen, Polvorín-Monacillos, Los Romeros, Los Martínez, \nTabonucal, Las Curias, Plesbisito 1,2 y 3, Capetillo, and Parcelas Falú, \nHospital Auxilio Mutuo / SER de Puerto Rico area, Placita Roosvelt area, \nand  the  areas  near  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Puerto \nRicoamong others. As a result, persons with mobility disabilities have been \ndenied access to the accommodations and services available to the general \npublic. Furthermore, these barriers deter persons with mobility disabilities \nfrom exploring or visiting areas of the City. Missing and Inaccessible curb \nramps also delay travel and cause persons with mobility disabilities to fear \nfor their safety, as these conditions often create dangerous situations. \n29.  Defendant has not provided and does not provide persons with mobility \ndisabilities with any map (whether paper or electronic), signage or other \nform of notice of any routes, or parts of routes, in the City’s pedestrian \nright of way that are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Notice \nof  completed  accessibility  improvements  and  plans  for  scheduled \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 17 of 46\naccessibility improvements are not posted on the City websites, and notice \nof  such  information  is  not  made  otherwise  available  to  persons  with \nmobility disabilities. As a result of the lack of any notice, maps, or signage \nregarding the location of accessible routes within the City’s pedestrian \nright of way, persons with mobility disabilities have been and continue to \nbe deterred from and impeded in travelling to various parts of the City, \nthus denying them meaningful and equal access to the City’s pedestrian \nright of way and its other facilities, programs, services, and activities. \n30.  Defendant  failed  to  prepare  and  implement  a  timely  Self  Evaluation \nrelating to the construction and maintenance of curb ramps as required by \nfederal law. The federal regulations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct and the ADA require that public entities create a Self Evaluation by \nJune 3, 1978 and July 26, 1992, respectively. 45 C.F.R § 84.6; 28 C.F.R. § \n35.105. A Self Evaluation must include an evaluation of whether current \nservices, policies, and practices discriminate on the basis of disability. The \nCity  has  made  no  efforts  to  evaluate  its  pedestrian  right  of  way  for \naccessibility. The City has made no survey to determine the existence of \ncurb  ramps  at  intersections  within  the  City  despite  of  the  deadlines \nestablished by Section 504 and the ADA. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 18 of 46\n31.  Defendant has failed and is failing to prepare and implement a Transition \nPlan relating to the construction and maintenance of curb ramps in the \npedestrian  right  of  way  as  required  by  federal  law.  The  regulations \nimplementing  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  required  public \nentities that receive federal financial assistance to create a Transition Plans \nby June 3, 1978. See 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(e). The regulations implementing \nTitle  II  of  the  ADA  required  local  governmental  entities  to  create \nTransition Plans by July 26, 1992. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d). A Transition \nPlan  must  include,  among  other  things,  an  up-to-date  schedule  for \nproviding curb ramps or other sloped areas where the pedestrian right of \nway crosses streets. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(e). \nTo date, Defendant has not prepared a compliant Transition Plan pursuant \nto either Section 504 or the ADA. \n32.  Defendant’s failure to conduct a timely Self Evaluation and prepare and \nimplement a compliant Transition Plan relating to the pedestrian right of \nway, including curb ramps, as required by Section 504 and the ADA, is \nfurther  evidence  of  Defendant’s  failure  to  comply  with  the  “program \naccess” requirements of both statutes.  \n33.  This discrimination and continuing systemic inaccessibility cause a real \nand  immediate  threat of current and continuing harm to persons with \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 19 of 46\nmobility disabilities within the City as represented by the experiences of \nthe Named Plaintiffs. \nEXPERIENCES OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n34.  Named  Plaintiff  Faustino  Xavier  Betancourt-Colon  uses  a  electric \nwheelchair and scooter for mobility. His conditions include: Congestive \nheart failure (20% heart function), hydrocephalus, and leg deformity.  He \nlives  in  the  Los  Lirios  Public  Housing  (GPS  18.355672,  -66.044050) \nneighborhood  of  Cupey,  San  Juan,  Puerto  Rico.  He  has  encountered \nnumerous barriers to full and equal use of the pedestrian right of way in \nneighborhoods throughout the City. This includes, but is not limited to \nthose described below. \n35.  In particular, Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon encounters many \nbarriers  to  accessibility  in  his  neighborhood.  For  example,  at  the \nintersection at Las Vista Shopping Village (GPS 18.357517, -66.062465), \nthere  are  no curb ramps at any corner. Additionally, at the  corner of \nCeciliana  Street and  Campillana  Street (GPS  18.359592,  -66.046375), \nthere are no curb ramps that allow travel from northwest to southeast \nacross the Ceciliana street. At these and other intersections with missing \ncurb  ramps,  Plaintiff  Faustino  Xavier  Betancourt-Colon  must  use \ndriveways  to  descend  to  street  level  and  then  ride  in  the  street  with \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 20 of 46\nvehicular traffic, which places him in danger. While riding in the street \nwith  vehicular  traffic,  he  has  been  detained  and  questioned  by  law \nenforcement officers of the City. Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-\nColon enjoys spending time in his neighborhood for social engagements, \nentertainment events, and community events. Frequently, he is forced to \ntravel by car instead of by wheelchair due to the many missing curb ramps. \nIn addition, he travels within his neighborhood far less frequently than he \nwould like to due to the dangers involved in attempting to navigate the \nCity’s pedestrian right of way. \n36.  Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon also encounters many barriers \nto accessibility in the San Juan City Hospital area. For example, along \nPaseo Jose Celso Barbosa, there are intersections with no curb ramps. For \nexample, along Paseo Jose Celso Barbosa and Centro Medico Avenue, \nalmost all ramps at the intersections have “Inaccessible” curb ramps at the \ncorners. Specifically, there are “Inaccessible” curb ramps or no curb ramps \nat  the  following  locations:  Jose  Celso  Barbosa  Street  (18.393210,  -\n66.075142), Centro Medico Avenue (18.392572, -66.075274), Jose Celso \nBarbosa  Street  (18.394801.  -66.072109),  Jose  Celso  Barbosa  Street  ( \n18.396820, -66.075381). Other sample barriers include  inexistent  curb \ntramps  at  Andalucía  Avenue  and  Acapulco  Street  (18.415183,  -\n20 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 21 of 46\n66.079562); inexistent curb ramps between Carlos Chardon Avenue and \nTeniente Cesar Gonzalez (18.423805. -66.067777), inexistent curb ramp \nbetween Teniente Cesar Gonzalez Avenue and Manuel Camuñas St. ( \n18.425463, -66.068071); no curb ramp at Calle Carlos Chardon (in front \nof the Federico Degetau Federal Building) at 18.424641, -66.065096. Due \nto the many barriers to accessibility in the near his home and many other \nareas of San Juan, Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon’s ability to \ntravel throughout San Juan is compromised. He frequently has to allow a \ngreat deal of extra time to reach his destination just so that he will be able \nto find parking in a location near a route that he knows to be accessible. \nOther times, Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon is forced to pay \nextra money for a parking spot close to his destination, such as when he \nattends his medical appointments, in order to avoid the  great dangers \ninvolved in trying to navigate the pedestrian right of way while having to \nuse the vehicular roadway. In addition, the inaccessibility of the pedestrian \nright of way in the City has become a factor in his major life decisions. For \nexample, in deciding where to buy groceries, Plaintiff Faustino Xavier \nBetancourt-Colon is taking into account whether he will be able to reach \nhis destination via the pedestrian right of way.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 22 of 46\n37.

As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff Xavier Betancourt-Colon has been \nand continues to be denied equal access to his neighborhood and other \nparts of his community that persons without mobility disabilities enjoy. He \nis often deterred from using his wheelchair to visit public facilities, places \nof  public  accommodation,  and  friends  because  he  chooses  instead  to \nremain safe from the serious risks involved in navigating the inaccessible \npedestrian right of way. He is also forced to risk his safety by traveling in \nthe street because there are insufficient accessible curb ramps to allow him \nto travel freely on City sidewalks. As a result of these and other missing \ncurb  ramps  in  his  neighborhood  and  in  San  Juan,  Plaintiff  Xavier \nBetancourt-Colon  is  limited  in  his  ability  to  travel  the  sidewalks  and \nthoroughfares of his own neighborhood and in San Juan. When he does \nuse the pedestrian right of way, Plaintiff Xavier Betancourt-Colon is often \nforced to use unpredictable driveways to descend to street level, which can \nbe dangerous because it puts him in the line of vehicular traffic. As a result \nof the foregoing, Plaintiff Xavier Betancourt-Colon has been and continues \nto be limited in his ability to use much of the pedestrian right of way in the \nCity due to poorly positioned, steep, or missing curb ramps. The need to \nuse circuitous routes can cause delay and unsafe situations for wheelchair \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 30 of 46\nuse. Traveling in the street causes Plaintiff Xavier Betancourt-Colon stress, \ngreat inconvenience, and undue risk to his safety. \n39.  Named  Plaintiff  Virgen  Negron-Villegas  has  spina  bifida  and \nhydrocephalus and uses a wheelchair for mobility. She lives in Cupey, San \nJuan, Puerto Rico (but travels to San Juan on a weekly basis for social \nengagements, entertainment events, professional meetings, and functions \nat  the  school  that  his  children  attend.  He  has  encountered  numerous \nobstacles to using portions of the pedestrian right of way throughout the \nCity. This includes, but is not limited to, those described below. \n40.  She lives in the Los Lirios Public Housing (GPS 18.355672, -66.044050) \nneighborhood  of  Cupey,  San  Juan,  Puerto  Rico.  She  has  encountered \nnumerous barriers to full and equal use of the pedestrian right of way her \nneighborhood and throughout the City. This includes, but is not limited to \nthose described below. \n41.  In particular, Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas encounters many barriers \nto accessibility near her home. For example, at the intersection of Road \n199 from Paseos to Los Lirios Public Housing, there are inaccessible curb \nramps at all corners for crossing. At the intersection of Ceciliana Street and \nRoad 199, there are inaccessible curb ramps and deteriorated sidewalks. \nDel Carmen pharmacy (18.354616, -66.040183) and surrounding business \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 31 of 46\nare  completely  inaccessible  by  wheelchair,  forcing  Plaintiff  Virgen \nNegron-Villegas  into  the  path  of  vehicular  traffic  before  reaching  a \ncrosswalk. At the intersection of Paraná Avenue and Saluen street, there \nare no curb ramps (18.372878, -66.066546). At the intersection of Paraná \nAvenue  and  Wesser  street,  there  are  no  curb  ramps  (18.375112.  -\n66.066068).  Similarly, at the intersection of Paraná Avenue and  Sena \nStreet, there are no curb ramps (18.377101, -66.064943).  \n42.  Due to these and other barriers, Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas must \nchoose between her time and her safety when he travels on the pedestrian \nright of way in the City. She sometimes travels up to three times the \ndistance of a direct route in order to find usable curb ramps, while also \navoiding other obstacles, such as the naturally hilly terrain. When Plaintiff \nVirgen Negron-Villegas encounters corners that are missing curb ramps, \nshe must use a driveway in the middle of the street, if one is even available, \nto descend to street level and then ride in the street along with vehicular \ntraffic  until  she  reaches  the  intersection,  which  endangers  her  safety. \nCorners with curb ramps that do not align with the crosswalk are also \ndangerous,  because  she  is  forced  into  the  line  of  traffic.  On  several \noccasions, she has nearly been hit by a car at intersections with missing or \nunsafe curb ramps. If Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas attempts to ride \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 32 of 46\nover a curb with no curb ramp, she risks falling out of her wheelchair or \ndamaging his wheelchair. She often finds that her wheelchair batteries \nbecome  depleted  due  to  the  longer  routes  he  must  take  to  reach  his \ndestination.  If  her  wheelchair  were  to  break  down  due  to  overuse  or \ndamage, Plaintiff would be stranded and vulnerable. Thus, Plaintiff  Virgen \nNegron-Villegas experiences a great deal of stress and fear because of the \nmany access barriers that he encounters in the City’s pedestrian right of \nway. \n43.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas is deterred \nfrom visiting many areas of San Juan as frequently as she would like to. \nWhen she does attempt to navigate the pedestrian right of way in the City, \nshe experiences stress and great inconvenience. She also faces serious risks \nto her safety when he encounters missing or inadequate curb ramps and is \nforced to ride into the street. \n44.  These  experiences  are  typical  of  those  experienced  by  persons  with \nmobility disabilities in the City and demonstrate the inaccessibility, fear, \nhumiliation, and isolation that people with mobility disabilities experience \nwhile trying to navigate the City’s pedestrian right of way. \n45.  There are other missing and Inaccessible curb ramps at various locations \nwithin the City’s pedestrian right of way. Other barriers require some form \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 33 of 46\nof remediation to meet the City’s program access obligations, and/or its \nobligations  to  perform  new  construction  and/or  alterations  in  full \ncompliance with federal and state disability access design standards, if any \nexists. Non-compliance is so severe that they constitute safety hazards to \npersons  with  mobility  disabilities,  including  curb  ramps  with  running \nslopes greater than 8.3%. \n46.  The barriers described herein do represent an exhaustive list of missing \nand Inaccessible curb ramps. The barriers herein merely provides a partial \nlist  of  such  barriers  facing  the  Named  Plaintiffs  and  class  members \nthroughout  the  City  as  they  attempt  to  navigate  the  City’s  pedestrian \nroutes. Neither the ADA or Section 504, requires Plaintiffs to identify each \nand every barrier limiting access to the City’s pedestrian routes. Rather, \nthe ADA and Section 504 require the City to complete a transition plan \nidentifying barriers at existing facilities, including those barriers involving \ncurb ramps, crosswalks, and mid-block barriers on sidewalks. The City has \nfailed to comply with these requirements as alleged herein. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n47.  Plaintiffs bring this action individually, and on behalf of all persons with \nmobility disabilities who use or will use the pedestrian right of way in the \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 34 of 46\nCity of San Juan, as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \n48.  Each member of the class is a “qualified person with a disability” and/or a \nperson with a “disability” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq. The persons in the class \nare so numerous that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable and \nthat the disposition of their claims in a class action rather than in individual \nactions will benefit the parties and the Court. The class consists of tens of \nthousands of persons with mobility disabilities. \n49.  Defendant has failed and continues to fail to comply with the ADA and \nSection 504 in its implementation of the City’s administrative methods, \npolicies,  procedures,  and  practices  with  regard  to  the  construction, \nremediation, and maintenance of curb ramps that provide access to the \nCity’s pedestrian right of way. \n50.  Defendant has not adopted and does not enforce appropriate administrative \nmethods,  policies,  procedures,  and/or  practices  to  ensure  that  it  is  in \ncompliance with the ADA and Section 504 to ensure nondiscrimination \nagainst persons with mobility disabilities and equal access to facilities, \nprograms, services, and activities for persons with mobility disabilities. \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 35 of 46\n51.  The violations of the ADA and Section 504 set forth in detail herein have \ninjured all members of the proposed class and violated their rights in a \nsimilar way. \n52.  Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive or declaratory relief \nwith respect to the class as a whole. Class claims are brought for the \npurposes of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief only. \n53.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class in that \nthey arise from the same course of conduct engaged in by Defendant. The \nrelief sought herein will benefit all class members alike. \n54.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass. They have no interests adverse to the interests of other members of \nthe class and have retained counsel who is competent and experienced in \nlitigating actions under the ADA in Puerto Rico. \n55.  The requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are \nmet with regard to the proposed class in that: \ni.  The class is so numerous that it would be impractical to bring all \nclass members before the Court; \nii.  There are questions of law and fact which are common to the class; \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 36 of 46\niii.  The Named Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief \nare typical of the claims of the class; \niv.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent common \nclass interests and are represented by counsel who are experienced \nin law reform class actions and the disability rights issues in this \ncase; and \nv.  Defendant  has  acted  or  refused  to  act  on  grounds  generally \napplicable to the class. \n56.  The common questions of law and fact, shared by the Named Plaintiffs and \nall class members, include but are not limited to: \ni.  Whether Defendant is violating Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \nsections 12131, et seq., by failing to install or remediate curb ramps \nthat make the City’s pedestrian right of way program, service, or \nactivity  accessible  to  and  useable  by  persons  with  mobility \ndisabilities,  and  otherwise  discriminating  against  persons  with \nmobility disabilities, as set forth above; \nii.  Whether Defendant is violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. section 794 et seq., by failing to install or remediate \ncurb ramps that make the City’s pedestrian right of way program, \nservice,  or  activity  accessible  to  and  useable  by  persons  with \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 37 of 46\nmobility disabilities, and otherwise discriminating against people \nwith mobility disabilities, as set forth above; \niii.  Whether  Defendant  has  performed  “new  construction”  and/or \n“alterations”  to  the  City’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  within  the \nmeaning of 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, triggering an obligation to construct \nor retrofit curb ramps; Whether Defendant has performed  “new \nconstruction” and/or “alterations” to the City’s pedestrian right of \nway  within  the  meaning  of  45  C.F.R.  §  84.23,  triggering  an \nobligation to construct or retrofit curb ramps; \niv.  Whether Defendant, by its actions and omissions alleged herein, has \nengaged in a pattern or practice of discriminating against Plaintiffs \nand  other  persons  with  mobility  disabilities  in  violation  of \napplicable federal and state disability access laws. \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. \n \n57.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \nthe foregoing paragraphs. \n58.  Title II of the ADA provides in pertinent part: “[N]o qualified individual \nwith a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 38 of 46\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n59.  At all times relevant to this action, the City was and is a “public entity” \nwithin the meaning of Title II of the ADA and provides a pedestrian right \nof way program, service, or activity to the general public. \n60.  At  all  times  relevant  to  this  action,  Plaintiffs  were  and  are  qualified \nindividuals with disabilities within the meaning of Title II of the ADA and \nmeet the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the services, \nprograms, or activities of the City. 42 U.S.C. § 12131. \n61.  Defendant is mandated to operate each program, service, or activity “so \nthat, when viewed in its entirety, it is readily accessible to and useable by \nindividuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150; see also 28 C.F.R. §§ \n35.149. This requirement applies to all programs, services, and activities \nthat a public entity offers, whether or not they are carried out in facilities \nthat have been constructed or altered since January 26, 1992. Pedestrian \nrights of way themselves constitute a vital public program, service, or \nactivity under Title II of the ADA. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104; Barden v. City of \nSacramento, 292 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002); Procurador De Personas Con \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 39 of 46\nImpedimentos v. Municipality of San Juan, 541 F.Supp.2d 468, 471-73 \n(DPR 2008). \n62.  Furthermore, the regulations implementing Title II of the ADA specifically \nprovide  that  a  public  entity  must  install  curb  ramps  at  intersections \nwhenever it newly constructs or alters sidewalks, streets, roads, and/or \nhighways  at  any  time  after  January  26,  1992  and  must  comply  with \nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) or with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities \n(ADAAG). 28 C.F.R. § 35.151. A street resurfacing project by a public \nentity is one example of an alteration under the meaning of the regulation. \nKinney v. Yerusalim, 9 F.3d 1067, 1073-74 (3rd Cir. 1993); Lonberg v. \nCity of Riverside, No. 97-CV-0237, 2007 WL 2005177, at * 6 (C.D. Cal. \n2007). \n63.  The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide that a public \nentity must maintain the features of all facilities required to be accessible \nby the  ADA. 28 C.F.R. § 35.133. Facilities required to be  accessible \ninclude roads, walks, and passageways. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n64.  Due to the lack of accessible curb ramps as alleged above, as well as \nDefendant’s failure to conduct a timely Self Evaluation and implement a \nTransition Plan for the pedestrian right of way, the City’s pedestrian right \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 40 of 46\nof way is not fully, equally, or meaningfully accessible to Plaintiffs when \nviewed  in  its  entirety.  Defendant  has therefore  violated  the  “program \naccess” obligation applicable to pedestrian right of way facilities that have \nnot been newly constructed or altered since January 26, 1992. \n65.  Additionally, the sidewalks, cross walks, and other walkways at issue \nconstitute facilities within the meaning of ADAAG and UFAS. Plaintiffs \nare informed, believe, and thereon allege that since January 26, 1992, \nDefendant has constructed, altered, or repaired parts of these facilities \nwithin the meaning of the ADAAG and the UFAS, and that Defendant, \nthrough its administrative methods, policies, and practices, has failed to \nmake such  facilities readily accessible to and  usable  by persons  with \ndisabilities through the construction and retrofit of curb ramps as required \nunder federal accessibility standards and guidelines. \n66.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereon allege that since March 15, \n2012,  Defendant  has  constructed,  altered,  or  repaired  parts  of  these \nfacilities within the meaning of the ADAAG and the UFAS, and that \nDefendant, through its administrative methods, policies, and practices, has \nfailed to make such facilities compliant with the ADAAG and the UFAS \nas updated in 2010, as required under 28 C.F.R. 35.151(c)(5). \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 41 of 46\n67.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereon allege that Defendant and its \nagents and employees have violated and continue to violate Title II of the \nADA by failing to maintain the features of the City’s walkways and curb \nramps that are required to be accessible. \n68.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereon allege that Defendant and its \nagents and employees have violated and continue to violate Title II of the \nADA by failing to timely respond to and remedy complaints regarding the \nlack of accessible curb ramps necessary to ensure access to the City’s \npedestrian right of way. \n69.  The ADA’s regulations at 43 C.F.R. §17.550(a)(3) prevent public entities \nfrom refusing to comply with their obligations to provide persons with \ndisabilities meaningful access to their programs and services by claiming \nthat doing so would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, \nunless such a determination is made by an agency head or his or her \ndesignee after consulting all agency resources available for use in the \nfunding  and  operation  of  the  conducted  program  or  activity  and  the \ndetermination is accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for \nreaching that conclusion. On information and belief, the City, through its \nagency heads and/or designees, has failed to make such a determination \naccompanied by the required written statement and has, therefore, failed to \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 42 of 46\ndemonstrate that providing the access Plaintiffs seek to its pedestrian right \nof way would impose an undue financial or administrative burden. \n70.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered and continue to suffer difficulty, hardship, anxiety, and danger, \ndue to Defendant’s failure to remediate missing, defective, Inaccessible \ncurb ramps throughout the City’s pedestrian right of way. These failures \nhave denied and continue to deny Plaintiffs the full, equal, and meaningful \naccess to the pedestrian right of way that the ADA requires. \n71.  Because  Defendant’s  discriminatory  conduct  presents  a  real  and \nimmediate threat of current and continuing future violations, declaratory \nand injunctive relief are appropriate remedies. \n72.  Pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  12133  and  12205,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, \nexpert expenses, and costs incurred in bringing this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as set forth below. \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n \n73.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \nthe foregoing paragraphs. \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 43 of 46\n74.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides in pertinent part: \n“[N]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by \nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving federal financial assistance . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n75.  Plaintiffs are otherwise qualified to participate in the services, programs, \nor activities that are provided to individuals in the City. See 29 U.S.C. § \n794(b). \n76.  The City is a direct recipient of federal financial assistance sufficient to \ninvoke the coverage of Section 504, and has received such federal financial \nassistance at all times relevant to the claims asserted in this Complaint. \n77.  Defendant and its agents and employees have violated and continue to \nviolate the Rehabilitation Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder \nby  excluding  Plaintiffs  from  participation  in,  denying  Plaintiffs  the \nbenefits  of,  and  subjecting  Plaintiffs  based  solely  by  reason  of  their \ndisability to, discrimination in the  benefits and  services of the  City’s \npedestrian right of way and for the reasons set forth above. \n78.  Additionally, under Section 504, a recipient of federal financial assistance \nmust install ADAAG- or UFAS-compliant curb ramps at intersections \nwhenever it newly constructs or alters sidewalks, streets, roads, and/or \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 44 of 46\nhighways at any time after June 3, 1977. Willits v. City of Los Angeles, \n925 F. Supp. 2d. 1089, 1094 (C.D. Cal. 2013). Defendant has violated \nSection 504 by failing to construct or install such compliant curb ramps at \nintersections throughout the City where it has newly constructed or altered \nstreets, roads, and/or highways since June 3, 1977.  \n79.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs \nsuffered and continue to suffer difficulty, hardship, anxiety, and danger \ndue to Defendant’s failure to remediate missing, defective, Inaccessible \ncurb ramps throughout the City’s pedestrian right of way. These failures \nhave  denied  Plaintiffs  the  full,  equal,  and  meaningful  access  to  the \npedestrian right of way that Section 504 requires. \n80.  Because  Defendant’s  discriminatory  conduct  presents  a  real  and \nimmediate threat of current and continuing violations, declaratory and \ninjunctive relief are appropriate remedies. \n81.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, and to recover from Defendant the reasonable attorneys’ \nfees and costs incurred in bringing this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as set forth below. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request judgment as follows: \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 1   Filed 09/06/19   Page 45 of 46\nA.

This  lawsuit  is  brought  against  Defendant  to  redress  its  systemic, \npervasive,  and  continuing  policy,  pattern,  or  practice  of  unlawfully \ndiscriminating against Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals with \nmobility disabilities. As alleged further below, the City has failed and \ncontinues to fail to install and maintain curb ramps that are necessary to \nmake its pedestrian right of way readily accessible to people with mobility \ndisabilities, and to comply with its obligation to install and/or remediate \ncurb ramps when it engages in alterations or new construction of streets, \nbus stops, and sidewalks. A substantial number of the street crossings \nwithin the City’s pedestrian right of way do not comply with applicable \nstate  and  federal  regulations  addressing  accessibility  for  people  with \ndisabilities because, for example, they lack curb ramps entirely, have curb \nramps on only one side of a corner, have curb ramps that are too narrow, \ntoo steep, or too cracked, broken, or uplifted to be used by people with \nmobility disabilities. \n2.  The  City’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  is  a  fundamental  public  program, \nservice, and/or activity that the City provides for the benefit of its residents \nand visitors. Accessible curb ramps are necessary to permit people with \nmobility disabilities who use mobility aids such as wheelchairs, scooters, \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 3 of 54\ncanes, walkers, or crutches to access the City’s pedestrian right of way. \nBecause the City’s pedestrian right of way constitutes a core mode of \ntransportation, the absence of accessible curb ramps prevents people with \nmobility  disabilities  from  independently,  fully,  and  meaningfully \nparticipating in all aspects of society, including employment, housing, \neducation, transportation, public accommodations, and recreation, among \nothers. Accordingly, an accessible pedestrian right of way is essential to \nrealizing the integration mandate of disability non-discrimination laws, \nincluding the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n3.  Named Plaintiffs Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon and Virgen Negron-\nVillegas  are  two  individuals  with  mobility  disabilities  who  bring  this \naction on behalf of themselves and all persons with mobility disabilities \nwho, like Named Plaintiffs, live in, work in, or visit San Juan and are being \ndiscriminated against and subjected to unlawful or hazardous conditions \ndue to the absence of accessible curb ramps within the City’s pedestrian \nright of way. \n4.  Federal  disability  access  laws  were  enacted  to  provide  persons  with \ndisabilities an equal opportunity to participate fully in civic life. See 29 \nU.S.C. § 794 (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section \n504”));  42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a)(7)  (Americans  with  Disabilities  Act \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 4 of 54\n(“ADA”)). Under the ADA and Section 504, a public entity’s sidewalks, \ncrosswalks and paved paths—collectively referred to as a public entity’s \n“pedestrian right of way”—are a “program,” “service,” or “activity” that \nmust be readily accessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Barden v. \nCity of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002); Procurador De \nPersonas Con Impedimentos v. Municipality of San Juan, 541 F.Supp.2d \n468,  471-73  (DPR2008).  As  detailed  further  below,  Defendant  has \nexcluded  Plaintiffs  and  all  other  similarly  situated  individuals  with \nmobility disabilities from participation in or denied them the benefits of \nDefendant’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  program,  service,  or  activity,  or \nsubjected them to discrimination by: a) failing to install and remediate curb \nramps in newly-constructed or altered portions of the City’s pedestrian \nright of way; and, b) failing to install, remediate and maintain curb ramps \nwhere necessary to provide people with mobility disabilities meaningful \naccess to the City’s pedestrian right of way, when viewed in its entirety. \n5.  Both the ADA (since January 27, 1992) and Section 504 (since June 3, \n1977) have mandated that whenever a government entity newly constructs \na bus stop pad or newly constructs or alters streets, roads, or highways, it \nmust install curb ramps at any intersection having curbs or other barriers \nto entry from a street level pedestrian walkway, to ensure that newly \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 5 of 54\nconstructed or altered pedestrian right of way programs and facilities are \nreadily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.151(a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(4)(i)(1), (b)(4)(i)(2); 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. D § \n10.2.1; 45 C.F.R. § 84.23(b); 36 C.F.R. pt. 1191, app. D § 810.2.3. The \nADA and Section 504 also mandate that a public entity operate each \nprogram, service, or activity so that the program, service, or activity, when \nviewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals \nwith disabilities. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a), (b)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(a), (b). \nTo the extent structural changes to facilities existing as of the effective date \nof the ADA or Section 504 are necessary to achieve this “program access” \nmandate, such changes were to have been made by no later than January \n26, 1995 under the ADA, and by no later than June 3, 1980 under Section \n504. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(c); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(d). \n6.  The City’s pedestrian right of way, when viewed in its entirety, is not \nreadily accessible to and usable by persons with mobility disabilities due \nto the City’s failure to install and maintain accessible curb ramps. In \naddition, the City has failed to install accessible curb ramps or remediate \nexisting curb ramps as part of new construction or alterations of its streets, \nroadways, and highways. As a result, Plaintiffs and other persons with \nmobility  disabilities  must  forgo  participation  in  daily  activities  — \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 6 of 54\nincluding visiting public facilities, places of public accommodation, or \nfriends — or risk injury or damage to their mobility devices by traveling \non or around inaccessible portions of the pedestrian right of way. At times, \nPlaintiffs are able to use the pedestrian right of way, but only by taking \ncircuitous routes to avoid barriers to accessibility, which wastes their time \nand energy. As a result of the many missing and noncompliant curb ramps \nin the City, people with mobility disabilities do not have full and equal \naccess to the pedestrian right of way. \n7.  The discrimination and denial of meaningful, equal and safe access to the \nCity’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  for  persons  with  mobility  disabilities \ncomplained  of  herein  is  the  direct  result  of  Defendant’s  policies, \nprocedures,  and  practices  with  regard  to  pedestrian  walkways  and \ndisability access,  including, but not limited to the following: \ni.  The failure to install accessible curb ramps at locations where no \ncurb ramps exist, or where inaccessible curb ramps exist, within the \ntime required by applicable federal disability access laws or on any \nother reasonable schedule; \nii.  The failure to install accessible curb ramps, or remediate existing \nnoncompliant curb ramps, at street corners or sidewalks that are \nnewly constructed, resurfaced or otherwise altered; \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 7 of 54\niii.  The failure to install curb ramps at intersections in the City that are \nnecessary  to  provide  meaningful,  equal  and  safe  access  to  the \npedestrian right of way; \niv.  The  failure  to  develop  and  implement  a  process  for  identifying \nintersections and corners throughout the City at which curb ramps \nare necessary to provide meaningful, equal, and safe access to the \npedestrian right of way; \nv.  The failure to adopt and utilize or require and enforce the utilization \nof a curb ramp design that complies with applicable federal and state \ndesign standards or guidelines; \nvi.  The failure to install accessible curb ramps within a reasonable time \nframe after receiving a request to do so or otherwise being notified \nof the need for an accessible curb ramp at a particular location; \nvii.  The  failure  to  adopt  or  implement  reasonable  administrative \nmethods,  policies,  and  procedures  for  inspecting,  repairing,  and \nmaintaining the pedestrian right of way, including curb ramps, as \nrequired by Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations \nincluding 28 C.F.R. § 35.133 (maintenance of accessible features); \nviii.  The failure to remediate corners with no curb ramps or with curb \nramps  that  are  not  properly  positioned  such  that  they  require \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 8 of 54\npedestrians with mobility disabilities to travel around the corner in \nthe street alongside vehicular traffic in order to access a crossing, or \ncause pedestrians with mobility disabilities to roll or fall into the \nroadway; \nix.  The  failure  to  remediate  curb  ramps  that  are  designed  and/or \nconstructed  in  a  noncompliant  manner  such  that  people  with \nmobility disabilities are denied meaningful access to the pedestrian \nright of way as a whole. These deficiencies often include one or \nmore of the following: \n1.  Running,  cross,  and  side  slopes  of  curb  ramps  that  are \nexcessively steep; \n2.  Ramps that are too narrow to accommodate wheelchairs or \nscooters; \n3.  Landings at the top of curb ramps that do not provide enough \nspace for a wheelchair to maneuver onto or off the ramp, \nforcing persons with mobility disabilities to use the much \nsteeper side flares or roll off the sidewalk entirely; \n4.  Excessive counter slopes at the bottoms of curb ramps. The \ncombination of excessive curb ramp slopes and/or gutter pan \ncounter slopes often forces wheelchair users to scrape the \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 9 of 54\npaving with their foot rests and can even bring a wheelchair \nor scooter to a full stop, creating risks of falling and injury; \nand \n5.  Lips at the bottom of curb ramps where the ramp meets the \ngutter. Such non-flush transitions create additional risks of \nscraping the pavement and/or sudden stops and possible falls \nand  injury.  Federal  access  codes  have  required  smooth \ntransitions at the base of curb ramps for several decades. \n8.  These administrative methods, policies, and practices, or lack thereof, \ndiscriminate against persons with disabilities by denying them access to \nthe City’s pedestrian right of way. Large sections of the more than 1,000 \nmiles  of  sidewalks  within  the  City’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  are \ninaccessible to persons with mobility disabilities due to missing or faulty \ncurb  ramps.  Representative  and  illustrative  examples  of  the  foregoing \ntypes of disability access barriers located throughout the City are identified \nbelow. \n9.  For  decades,  Defendant  has  failed  to  meet  ADA  and  Section  504 \naccessibility requirements and failed to adopt and implement systematic \nefforts to ensure that the City’s pedestrian right of way is readily accessible \nto  and  useable  by  persons  with  mobility  disabilities.  Furthermore, \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 10 of 54\nDefendant has for decades made compliance with the ADA and Section \n504  a  lower  priority  than  other  activities  and  projects,  including \ndiscretionary  activities  and  projects  not  mandated  by  law.  Prioritizing \ncompliance with the ADA and Section 504 in this manner also constitutes \na policy or practice that denies program access to and discriminates against \npersons  with  mobility  disabilities.  This  lawsuit  seeks  a  court  order \nrequiring Defendant to comply with these laws and to provide people with \nmobility disabilities meaningful access to the City’s pedestrian right of \nway over 29 years after the enactment of the ADA and many more years \nafter enactment of Section 504 protections. \n10.  Named Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon made efforts to resolve \nthis  dispute  without  litigation.  He  identified  multiple  deficiencies  \ninvolving the sidewalks and filed a formal complaint before the Defensoria \nde  las  Personas  con  Impedimento  (Puerto  Rico’s  state  government \nprotection and advocacy agency), complaint number 2018-060307. The \nCity of San Juan admitted the violations, according to the Defensoria, but \nthe defendant ignored its obligations under state and federal law.  \n11.  Plaintiffs thus bring this action to remedy violations of Title II of the ADA, \n42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq., and its accompanying regulations, Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq. and its accompanying \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 11 of 54\nregulations. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the \nabove statutes and an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs under \napplicable law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, brought pursuant to \nTitle II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 to 12213 and Section 504, 29 \nU.S.C. § 794, et seq. to redress systemic civil rights violations against \npeople with mobility disabilities by the City of San Juan. \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for \nclaims arising under the ADA and Section 504. \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343 for \nclaims arising under the ADA and Section 504. \n15.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  issue  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \n16.  Venue over Plaintiffs’ claims is proper in the District of Puerto Rico \nbecause  Defendant  resides  in  the  District  of  Puerto  Rico  within  the \nmeaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1391, and because the events, acts, and omissions \ngiving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in the District of Puerto Rico.  \nPARTIES \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 12 of 54\n \n17.

As a result of Defendant’s policies and practices with regard to curb ramps \nin the City’s pedestrian right of way, people with mobility disabilities have \nbeen discriminated against and denied full and equal access to the benefits \nof the City’s pedestrian right of way program or service. \n26.  Hereafter, an “Inaccessible” curb ramp shall refer to a curb ramp that did \nnot  comply  with  applicable  standards  for  accessible  design  (i.e.,  the \nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (“UFAS”), 1991 ADA Standards \nfor  Accessible  Design  (“ADAAG”)  or  the  2010  ADA  Standards  for \nAccessible Design (“2010 ADAAG”)), at the time it was constructed or \naltered. \n27.  Defendant  has  failed  and  is  failing  to  install,  remediate,  repair,  and \nmaintain curb ramps, i.e. thousands of intersections in the City have no \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 15 of 54\ncurb ramps or an inadequate number of curb ramps. Even where curb \nramps exist, many are improperly installed and/or maintained, lack a flush \ntransition to the street, have excessively steep running, cross, and side \nslopes, are too narrow, and/or are otherwise noncompliant. Many other \ncurb  ramps  are  not  maintained;  they  are  broken,  cracked,  crumbled, \nsunken, and/or caved. \n28.  As a result of Defendant’s policies and practices with regard to curb ramps, \nlarge segments of the City’s pedestrian right of way do not comply with \nnew construction or alteration accessibility requirements. For example, the \nCity has consistently failed to install curb ramps and remediate existing \ncurb ramps when it alters or constructs sidewalks and streets. \n29.  As  a  result  of  the  many  missing  and  noncompliant  curb  ramps  at \nintersections throughout the City, the pedestrian right of way, viewed in its \nentirety, is inaccessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Plaintiffs and \nothers with mobility disabilities are therefore denied meaningful access to \nthe City’s pedestrian right of way, public buildings, parks, transportation, \nand/or places of employment and public accommodation, either through \ncomplete denials of access or through delay of travel or unsafe conditions. \n30.  This lack of accessible curb ramps is not isolated or limited. Rather, these \nbarriers  to  full  and  equal  access  to  the  pedestrian  right  of  way  exist \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 16 of 54\nthroughout the City, thus denying individuals with mobility disabilities \nfull, equal, and meaningful access to the pedestrian right of way City-wide. \nPersons with mobility disabilities encounter missing or Inaccessible curb \nramps throughout the City, including in such areas, neigborhoods, and \nstreets  as  Cupey  Gardens,  Reparto  San  Rafael,  Ciudad  Señorial,  El \nSeñorial, Alturas de Cupey, Paseo Mayor, Paseo de Las Vistas, Paseo Las \nBrisas,  Monacillo,  La  Cumbre,  Villa  del  Alar,  San  Fernando,    Las \nAmericas, Ramon/Villa Nevarez, San Ana, University Gardens, Caparra \nTerrace,  Avenida  Central,  Avenida  Americo  Miranda,  Avenida \nDomenech, Avenida Central, Avenida Universidad, Ave Ponce de Leon, \nAvenida Eleonor Roosevelt, Hill Brothers Norte, Seburuco, Polvorín, Los \nPeñas, San Felipe, Tierra Santa, Shangai, Israel /Bitumul, Playita, Villa \nClemente, El Gandul, La Marina, Vista Alegre, Sierra Maestra, El Hoyo \nCaimito, Monacillos, Parcelas Caneja, Tortugo, Sector Julito, Morcello, \nQuebrada  Arenas,  Trastalleres,  Campo  Alegre,  Yambele, \nChícharo/Seboruco, Jurutungo, Barrio Obrero, Sector La Marina, Cantera, \nLas Monjas, Buena Vista (Hato Rey), Parada 27, Buena Vista (Santurce), \nBarrio  Obrero,  Sector  San  Ciprian,  Barrio  Obrero  Oeste,  Jardines  de \nBerwing, Balcones de San Martín, Altos del cabro, Barriada Figueroa, Hill \nBrothers Sur, Barrio Dulce, El Checo, La Perla, Villa Palmeras, Puerta de \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 17 of 54\nTierra, Buen Consejo, Barriada Venezuela, Victoria, Antigua Via El Hoyo \nI,  Barriada Borinquen, Polvorín-Monacillos, Los Romeros, Los Martínez, \nTabonucal, Las Curias, Plesbisito 1,2 y 3, Capetillo, and Parcelas Falú, \nHospital Auxilio Mutuo / SER de Puerto Rico area, Placita Roosvelt area, \nand  the  areas  near  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Puerto \nRicoamong others. As a result, persons with mobility disabilities have been \ndenied access to the accommodations and services available to the general \npublic. Furthermore, these barriers deter persons with mobility disabilities \nfrom exploring or visiting areas of the City. Missing and Inaccessible curb \nramps also delay travel and cause persons with mobility disabilities to fear \nfor their safety, as these conditions often create dangerous situations. \n31.  Defendant has not provided and does not provide persons with mobility \ndisabilities with any map (whether paper or electronic), signage or other \nform of notice of any routes, or parts of routes, in the City’s pedestrian \nright of way that are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Notice \nof  completed  accessibility  improvements  and  plans  for  scheduled \naccessibility improvements are not posted on the City websites, and notice \nof  such  information  is  not  made  otherwise  available  to  persons  with \nmobility disabilities. As a result of the lack of any notice, maps, or signage \nregarding the location of accessible routes within the City’s pedestrian \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 18 of 54\nright of way, persons with mobility disabilities have been and continue to \nbe deterred from and impeded in travelling to various parts of the City, \nthus denying them meaningful and equal access to the City’s pedestrian \nright of way and its other facilities, programs, services, and activities. \n32.  Defendant  failed  to  prepare  and  implement  a  timely  Self  Evaluation \nrelating to the construction and maintenance of curb ramps as required by \nfederal law. The federal regulations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct and the ADA require that public entities create a Self Evaluation by \nJune 3, 1978 and July 26, 1992, respectively. 45 C.F.R § 84.6; 28 C.F.R. § \n35.105. A Self Evaluation must include an evaluation of whether current \nservices, policies, and practices discriminate on the basis of disability. The \nCity  has  made  no  efforts  to  evaluate  its  pedestrian  right  of  way  for \naccessibility. The City has made no survey to determine the existence of \ncurb  ramps  at  intersections  within  the  City  despite  of  the  deadlines \nestablished by Section 504 and the ADA. \n33.  Defendant has failed and is failing to prepare and implement a Transition \nPlan relating to the construction and maintenance of curb ramps in the \npedestrian  right  of  way  as  required  by  federal  law.  The  regulations \nimplementing  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  required  public \nentities that receive federal financial assistance to create a Transition Plans \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 19 of 54\nby June 3, 1978. See 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(e). The regulations implementing \nTitle  II  of  the  ADA  required  local  governmental  entities  to  create \nTransition Plans by July 26, 1992. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d). A Transition \nPlan  must  include,  among  other  things,  an  up-to-date  schedule  for \nproviding curb ramps or other sloped areas where the pedestrian right of \nway crosses streets. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 84.22(e). \nTo date, Defendant has not prepared a compliant Transition Plan pursuant \nto either Section 504 or the ADA. \n34.  Defendant’s failure to conduct a timely Self Evaluation and prepare and \nimplement a compliant Transition Plan relating to the pedestrian right of \nway, including curb ramps, as required by Section 504 and the ADA, is \nfurther  evidence  of  Defendant’s  failure  to  comply  with  the  “program \naccess” requirements of both statutes.  \n35.  This discrimination and continuing systemic inaccessibility cause a real \nand immediate threat of current and continuing harm to persons with \nmobility disabilities within the City as represented by the experiences of \nthe Named Plaintiffs. \nEXPERIENCES OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n36.  Named  Plaintiff  Faustino  Xavier  Betancourt-Colon  uses  an  electric \nwheelchair and scooter for mobility. His conditions include: Congestive \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 20 of 54\nheart failure (20% heart function), hydrocephalus, and leg deformity.  He \nlives  in  the  Los  Lirios  Public  Housing  (GPS  18.355672,  -66.044050) \nneighborhood  of  Cupey,  San  Juan,  Puerto  Rico.  He  has  encountered \nnumerous barriers to full and equal use of the pedestrian right of way in \nneighborhoods throughout the City. This includes, but is not limited to \nthose described below. In particular, Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-\nColon encounters many barriers to accessibility in his neighborhood. For \nexample,  at  the  intersection  at  Las  Vista  Shopping  Village  (GPS \n18.357517,  -66.062465),  there  are  no  curb  ramps  at  any  corner. \nAdditionally, at the corner of Ceciliana Street and Campillana Street (GPS \n18.359592, -66.046375), there are no curb ramps that allow travel from \nnorthwest to southeast across the Ceciliana street. Additionally, at the \ncorner of Hortensia Street and Campillana Street (GPS (GPS 18.360739, \n066.04504), there are no curb ramps that allow travel from northwest to \nsoutheast  across  the  Hortensia  street.  Additionally,  at  the  corner  of \nCeciliana Street and Monte Brito Street (GPS 18.363495, -66.048893), \nthere are no curb ramps that allow travel from northwest to southeast \nacross the Monte Brito street. \n37.  At these and other intersections with missing curb ramps, Plaintiff Faustino \nXavier Betancourt-Colon must use driveways to descend to street level and \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 21 of 54\nthen ride in the street with vehicular traffic, which places him in danger. \nWhile riding in the street with vehicular traffic, he has been detained and \nquestioned by law enforcement officers of the City. Plaintiff Faustino \nXavier Betancourt-Colon enjoys spending time in his neighborhood for \nsocial  engagements,  entertainment  events,  and  community  events. \nFrequently, he is forced to travel by car instead of by wheelchair due to the \nmany missing curb ramps. In addition, he travels within his neighborhood \nfar less frequently than he would like to due to the dangers involved in \nattempting to navigate the City’s pedestrian right of way. \n38.  Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-Colon also encounters many barriers \nto accessibility in the San Juan City Hospital area. For example, along \nPaseo Jose Celso Barbosa, there are intersections with no curb ramps. For \nexample, along Paseo Jose Celso Barbosa and Centro Medico Avenue, \nalmost all ramps at the intersections have “Inaccessible” curb ramps at the \ncorners. Specifically, there are “Inaccessible” curb ramps or no curb ramps \nat  the  following  locations:  Jose  Celso  Barbosa  Street  (18.393210,  -\n66.075142), Centro Medico Avenue (18.392572, -66.075274), Jose Celso \nBarbosa  Street  (18.394801.  -66.072109),  Jose  Celso  Barbosa  Street  ( \n18.396820, -66.075381). Other sample barriers include  inexistent  curb \ntramps  at  Andalucía  Avenue  and  Acapulco  Street  (18.415183,  -\n21 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 22 of 54\n66.079562); inexistent curb ramps between Carlos Chardon Avenue and \nTeniente Cesar Gonzalez (18.423805. -66.067777), inexistent curb ramp \nbetween Teniente Cesar Gonzalez Avenue and Manuel Camuñas St. ( \n18.425463,  -66.068071);  no  curb  ramp  at  Calle  Carlos  Chardon  at \n18.424641, -66.065096. Due to the many barriers to accessibility in the \nnear his home and many other areas of San Juan, Plaintiff Faustino Xavier \nBetancourt-Colon’s ability to travel throughout San Juan is compromised. \nHe frequently has to allow a great deal of extra time to reach his destination \njust so that he will be able to find parking in a location near a route that he \nknows to be accessible. Other times, Plaintiff Faustino Xavier Betancourt-\nColon  is  forced  to  pay  extra  money  for  a  parking  spot  close  to  his \ndestination, such as when he attends his medical appointments, in order to \navoid the great dangers involved in trying to navigate the pedestrian right \nof  way  while  having  to  use  the  vehicular  roadway.  In  addition,  the \ninaccessibility of the pedestrian right of way in the City has become a \nfactor in his major life decisions. For example, in deciding where to buy \ngroceries,  Plaintiff  Faustino  Xavier  Betancourt-Colon  is  taking  into \naccount whether he will be able to reach his destination via the pedestrian \nright of way.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 23 of 54\n39.

Plaintiff Xavier Betancourt-Colon is aware of the barriers described above \nand was deterred from using the Inaccessible Sidewalks on a particular \noccasion, September 5, 2019. Plaintiff continues to be a disabled individual \ndeterred from using the sidewalks because the sidewalks, in their current \nstate, represent a risk to his safety that he is not willing to take at this time. \nBased on Plaintiff’s direct observations, Plaintiff is continuously aware \nthat  he  will  face  architectural  barriers  such  as  inexistent  curb  ramps. \nInexistent curb ramps forces Plaintiff to, for example, use his wheelchair \non the vehicular way until a curb ramp is available, which represents an \nunreasonable risk to his personal safety.  \n41.  Plaintiff also directly encountered the barriers described above on August \n5, 2019, among others. For example, on August 5, 2019 he observed an \ninaccessible curb ramp front of the Municipality of San Juan building at \n18.425273, -66.062741. Plaintiff knew at the time that using that sidewalk \nwould pose an unnecessary risk danger to his safety.  \n42.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff William Rodríguez-Burgos has been \nand continues to be denied equal access to the City’s right of way that \npersons without mobility disabilities enjoy. On September 1, 2019, he was \ndeterred from visiting Old San Juan because of the many Inaccessible \nSidewalks in the area, i.e. at 18.467081, -66.118499 (San Sebastian St., \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 30 of 54\nInt. Del Cristo St.). He is often deterred from visiting San Juan because the \nInaccessible Sidewalks represent a treat to his safety. In addition, for \nexample, Plaintiff no longer visits his urologist, Dr. Pablo Cardona (1431 \nAvenida  Juan  Ponce  de  León,  San  Juan,  00909,  Puerto  Rico)  (GPS \n18.447167, -66.069552) because of the Inaccessible Sidewalks in this area.   \n43.  He is also forced to risk his safety by traveling in the street because there \nare insufficient accessible curb ramps to allow him to travel freely on City \nsidewalks.  As  a  result  of  these  and  other  missing  curb  ramps  in  his \nneighborhood and in San Juan, Plaintiff Rodríguez-Burgos is limited in his \nability to travel the sidewalks and thoroughfares of his own neighborhood \nand in San Juan. When he does use the pedestrian right of way, Plaintiff \nRodríguez-Burgos  is  often  forced  to  use  unpredictable  driveways  to \ndescend to street level, which can be dangerous because it puts him in the \nline of vehicular traffic. As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff Rodríguez-\nBurgos has been and continues to be limited in his ability to use much of \nthe pedestrian right of way in the City due to poorly positioned, steep, or \nmissing curb ramps. The need to use circuitous routes can cause delay \nand  unsafe  situations  such  as  being  hit  by  a  car  when  using  the \nvehicular way. Traveling in the street causes Plaintiff Rodríguez-Burgos \nstress, great inconvenience, and undue risk to his safety. \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 31 of 54\n44.  Plaintiff Rodríguez-Burgos is aware of the barriers described above and \nwas  deterred  from  using  the  Inaccessible  Sidewalks  on  a  particular \noccasion, September 5, 2019. Plaintiff continues to be a disabled individual \ndeterred from using the sidewalks because the sidewalks, in their current \nstate, represent a risk to his safety that he is not willing to take at this time. \nBased on Plaintiff’s direct observations, Plaintiff is continuously aware \nthat  he  will  face  architectural  barriers  such  as  inexistent  curb  ramps. \nInexistent curb ramps forces Plaintiff to, for example, use his wheelchair \non the vehicular way until a curb ramp is available, which represents an \nunreasonable risk to his personal safety.  \n45.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff Rodríguez-Burgos has been and \ncontinues to be denied equal access to the Santurce and Old San Juan \nneighborhood and other parts of this community that persons without \nmobility disabilities enjoy. He is often deterred from visiting these areas \nbecause he chooses instead to remain at home safe from the serious risks \ninvolved in navigating the inaccessible pedestrian right of way. He is also \nforced  to  risk  his  safety  by  traveling  in  the  street  because  there  are \ninsufficient accessible curb ramps to allow him to travel freely on City \nsidewalks.  As  a  result  of  these  and  other  missing  curb  ramps  in  this \nneighborhood and in San Juan, Plaintiff Rodríguez-Burgos is limited in his \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 32 of 54\nability to travel the sidewalks and thoroughfares of Santurce and Old San \nJuan. When he does use the pedestrian right of way, Plaintiff Rodríguez-\nBurgos is often forced to use unpredictable driveways to descend to street \nlevel, which can be dangerous because it puts him in the line of vehicular \ntraffic. As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff has been and continues to be \nlimited in his ability to use much of the pedestrian right of way in the City \ndue to poorly positioned, steep, or missing curb ramps. The need to use \ncircuitous routes can cause delay and unsafe situations Traveling in the \nstreet causes Plaintiff Rodríguez-Burgos stress, great inconvenience, and \nundue risk to his safety. \n46.  Named  Plaintiff  Virgen  Negron-Villegas  has  spina  bifida  and \nhydrocephalus and uses a wheelchair for mobility. She lives in Cupey, San \nJuan, Puerto Rico (but travels to San Juan on a weekly basis for social \nengagements, entertainment events, professional meetings, and functions \nat  the  school  that  his  children  attend.  She  has  encountered  numerous \nobstacles to using portions of the pedestrian right of way throughout the \nCity. This includes, but is not limited to, those described below. \n47.  She lives in the Los Lirios Public Housing (GPS 18.355672, -66.044050) \nneighborhood  of  Cupey,  San  Juan,  Puerto  Rico.  She  has  encountered \nnumerous barriers to full and equal use of the pedestrian right of way her \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 33 of 54\nneighborhood and throughout the City. This includes, but is not limited to \nthose described below. \n48.  In particular, Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas encounters many barriers \nto accessibility (inaccessible curb ramps and deteriorated sidewalks) near \nher home. For example, at the intersection of Road 199 from Paseos to Los \nLirios Public Housing, there are inaccessible curb ramps at all corners for \ncrossing.1 At the intersection of Ceciliana Street and Road 199, there are \ninaccessible curb ramps and deteriorated sidewalks. Del Carmen pharmacy \n(18.354616,  -66.040183)  and  surrounding  business  are  completely \ninaccessible by wheelchair, forcing Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas into \nthe  path  of  vehicular  traffic  before  reaching  a  crosswalk.  At  the \nintersection of Paraná Avenue and Saluen street, there are no curb ramps \n(18.372878,  -66.066546).  At  the  intersection  of  Paraná  Avenue  and \nWesser street, there are no curb ramps (18.375112. -66.066068). Similarly, \nat the intersection of Paraná Avenue and Sena Street, there are no curb \nramps (18.377101, -66.064943).  These barriers are within five to seven \nminutes  from  Plaintiff’s  home  (walking  distance  for  an  able-bodied \nperson).  \n \n1 Defendant claims that it does not own or control this specific sidewalk. However, this is only one of the many \nInaccessible Sidewalks in violation of the ADA. Moreover, there is factual controversy as to who the owner and \noperator of this sidewalk. It is alleged that all sidewalks mentioned herein are owned and operated by the \nDefendant.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 34 of 54\n49.  Due to these and other barriers, Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas must \nchoose between her time and her safety when he travels on the pedestrian \nright of way in the City. She sometimes travels up to three times the \ndistance of a direct route in order to find usable curb ramps, while also \navoiding other obstacles, such as the naturally hilly terrain. When Plaintiff \nVirgen Negron-Villegas encounters corners that are missing curb ramps, \nshe must use a driveway in the middle of the street, if one is even available, \nto descend to street level and then ride in the street along with vehicular \ntraffic  until  she  reaches  the  intersection,  which  endangers  her  safety. \nCorners with curb ramps that do not align with the crosswalk are also \ndangerous,  because  she  is  forced  into  the  line  of  traffic.  On  several \noccasions, she has nearly been hit by a car at intersections with missing or \nunsafe curb ramps. If Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas attempts to ride \nover a curb with no curb ramp, she risks falling out of her wheelchair or \ndamaging his wheelchair. She often finds that her wheelchair batteries \nbecome  depleted  due  to  the  longer  routes  he  must  take  to  reach  his \ndestination.  If  her  wheelchair  were  to  break  down  due  to  overuse  or \ndamage, Plaintiff would be stranded and vulnerable. Thus, Plaintiff  Virgen \nNegron-Villegas experiences a great deal of stress and fear because of the \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 35 of 54\nmany access barriers that he encounters in the City’s pedestrian right of \nway. \n50.  Plaintiff Virgen Negron-Villegas is aware of the barriers described above \nand was deterred from using the Inaccessible Sidewalks on a particular \noccasion, September 5, 2019. Plaintiff continues to be a disabled individual \ndeterred from using the sidewalks because the sidewalks, in their current \nstate, represent a risk to her safety that she is not willing to take at this \ntime. Based on Plaintiff’s direct observations, Plaintiff is continuously \naware that he will face architectural barriers such as inexistent curb ramps. \nInexistent curb ramps forces Plaintiff to, for example, use his wheelchair \non the vehicular way until a curb ramp is available, which represents an \nunreasonable risk to his personal safety.  \n51.  Plaintiff also directly encountered the barriers described above on August \n5, 2019.   \n52.  Named Plaintiff A.R.V. has spina bifida, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy \nand uses a wheelchair for mobility. AVR’s mental age is 12 and she is \nunable to understand the nature of this proceeding, which is why she filed \nsuit by her next friend, her mother. AVR lives in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico \n(but  frequently  travels  to  San  Juan  for  medical  appointments, \nentertainment, and as a tourist. For example, she is (or has been) a patient \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 36 of 54\nof the following medical doctors in the San Juan: Dr. Juan Vigo Prieto, \nNeurosurgeon  (Santurce);  Rene  Vazquez  Botet,  Ophthalmologist \n(Domenech  Street,  San  Juan);  Jesus  R.  Velez  Borras,  neurologist \n(Domenech Street, San Juan);  Manuel Celso Garcia Ariz, orthopedic \nsurgeon (Centro Medico, Rio Piedras, San Juan, PR); Renan A. Dieppa \nAlvarez,  urologist  (Reparto  Metropolitano,  San  Juan,  00921);  Jesus \nAlvelo,  pediatrician  (Bayamon).  Her  last  medical  appointment  was  in \nAugust 2019. AVR has encountered numerous obstacles to using portions \nof the pedestrian right of way throughout the City, particularly in those \nareas near her medical doctors are located. This includes, but is not limited \nto, those described below. \n53.  Plaintiff also encounters Inaccessible Curbs in Old San Juan, an area that \nshe visits as a tourist. Her last visit to Old San Juan was on October 20, \n2019.  The  image  below  shows  AVR  (wheelchair)  and  her  family  on \nOctober  20,  2019.  During  her  visit,  she  personally  encountered  non-\nexistent curb ramps and barriers to her access.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 37 of 54\n \n54.  Due  to  these  and  other  barriers,  Plaintiff  AVR  and  her  family  is \ndiscouraged and deterred from visiting her medical doctor and Old San \nJuan because they know that they will encounters corners that are missing \ncurb  ramps  (for  example,  at  18.466662,  -66.117409;  18.468023,  -\n66.120892), she must use a driveway in the middle of the street, if one is \neven available, to descend to street level and then ride in the street along \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 38 of 54\nwith vehicular traffic until she reaches the intersection, which endangers \nher and her family’s safety. Corners with curb ramps that do not align with \nthe crosswalk are also dangerous, because she is forced into the line of \ntraffic.  When Plaintiff AVR attempts to ride over a curb with no curb \nramp, she risks falling out of her wheelchair or damaging her wheelchair. \nIf her wheelchair were to break down due to damage, Plaintiff would be \nstranded and vulnerable. Thus, Plaintiff AVR and her family experiences \na great deal of stress and fear because of the many access barriers that she \nand her family are aware of.  \n55.  Plaintiff AVR is aware of the barriers described above and was deterred \nfrom using many Inaccessible Sidewalks at Old San Juan on a particular \noccasion, October 20, 2019. Plaintiff continues to be a disabled individual \ndeterred from using the sidewalks because the sidewalks, in their current \nstate, represent a risk to her safety that she is not willing to take. Based on \nPlaintiff’s direct observations, Plaintiff is continuously aware that she will \nface architectural barriers such as inexistent curb ramps or improperly \nconfigurated curb-ramps. Inexistent curb ramps forces Plaintiff to, for \nexample, use her wheelchair on the vehicular way until a curb ramp is \navailable, which represents an unreasonable risk to her personal safety.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 39 of 54\n56.  As a result of the foregoing, Plaintiff AVR is deterred from visiting many \nareas of San Juan as frequently as she would like to. When she does attempt \nto navigate the pedestrian right of way in the City, she experiences stress \nand great inconvenience. She also faces serious risks to her safety when he \nencounters missing or inadequate curb ramps and is forced to ride into the \nstreet. \n57.  These  experiences  are  typical  of  those  experienced  by  persons  with \nmobility disabilities in the City and demonstrate the inaccessibility, fear, \nhumiliation, and isolation that people with mobility disabilities experience \nwhile trying to navigate the City’s pedestrian right of way. \n58.  There are other missing and Inaccessible curb ramps at various locations \nwithin the City’s pedestrian right of way. Other barriers require some form \nof remediation to meet the City’s program access obligations, and/or its \nobligations  to  perform  new  construction  and/or  alterations  in  full \ncompliance with federal and state disability access design standards, if any \nexists. Non-compliance is so severe that they constitute safety hazards to \npersons  with  mobility  disabilities,  including  curb  ramps  with  running \nslopes greater than 8.3%. \n59.  The barriers described herein do represent an exhaustive list of missing \nand Inaccessible curb ramps. The barriers herein merely provides a partial \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 40 of 54\nlist  of  such  barriers  facing  the  Named  Plaintiffs  and  class  members \nthroughout  the  City  as  they  attempt  to  navigate  the  City’s  pedestrian \nroutes. Neither the ADA or Section 504, requires Plaintiffs to identify each \nand every barrier limiting access to the City’s pedestrian routes. Rather, \nthe ADA and Section 504 require the City to complete a transition plan \nidentifying barriers at existing facilities, including those barriers involving \ncurb ramps, crosswalks, and mid-block barriers on sidewalks. The City has \nfailed to comply with these requirements as alleged herein.  \n60.  As a result of the inexistent of improperly configured curb ramps, Plaintiffs \nhave been exposed to increased risks of falling out of their wheelchair, \nscooter or tripping while using a walker when going over an elevated curb. \nPlaintiff will introduce expert testimony to show that without curb ramps, \nplaintiffs are exposed to hazards, i.e. increased risks of falling out of a \nwheelchair or scooter or tripping while using a walker when going over an \nelevated curb. Plaintiff’s expert testimony will show that curb ramps are \nessential to enable people with mobility impairments to go to work, to \naccess government buildings, to participate in recreational activities, to \nshop, and generally to allow such individuals to travel freely through their \ncommunities or places they visit.  For individuals with mobility issues to \ntravel independently, curb ramps are essential in providing an accessible \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 41 of 54\npath  of  travel  onto  and  off  of  public  sidewalks  to  public  facilities, \naccommodations, transportation, shopping districts, health care facilities, \netc. Defendant, however, is not committed to providing equal access to all \nCity residents and visitors.  \n61.  As a result of this civil action, all plaintiffs are aware of the barriers alleged \nherein; and these barriers constitute a determent to their access.  \"Disabled \nindividuals suffer a concrete and particularized injury when they visit an \nestablishment  that  does  not  comply  with  ADA  standards.\"  Medina-\nRodriguez v. Fernandez Bakery, Inc., 255 F. Supp. 3d 334, 338 (D.P.R. \n2017). Additionally, a plaintiff bringing a Title III ADA claim must \"show \na real and immediate threat that a particular barrier will cause future harm.\" \nDisabled Ams. for Equal Access, Inc. v. Ferries Del Caribe, Inc., 405 F.3d \n60, 64 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Dudley v. Hannaford Bros. Co., 333 F.3d \n299, 305 (1st Cir. 2003)). In demonstrating a likelihood of future harm, a \nplaintiff need not \"engage in a futile gesture\" of continuously confronting \ndiscriminatory barriers; rather, knowledge that those barriers remain in \nplace is sufficient. See 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1); Dudley, 333 F.3d at 305. \nFurthermore,  a  disabled  individual  deterred  from  visiting  a  public \naccommodation because of ADA violations suffers an actual and imminent \nharm. See Disabled Ams. For Equal Access, 405 F.3d at 64 (quoting \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 42 of 54\nPickern v. Holiday Quality Foods, Inc., 293 F.3d 1133, 1138 (9th Cir. \n2002)). \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n62.  Plaintiffs bring this action individually, and on behalf of all persons with \nmobility disabilities who use or will use the pedestrian right of way in the \nCity of San Juan, as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \n63.  Each member of the class is a “qualified person with a disability” and/or a \nperson with a “disability” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq. The persons in the class \nare so numerous that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable and \nthat the disposition of their claims in a class action rather than in individual \nactions will benefit the parties and the Court. The class consists of tens of \nthousands of persons with mobility disabilities. \n64.  Defendant has failed and continues to fail to comply with the ADA and \nSection 504 in its implementation of the City’s administrative methods, \npolicies,  procedures,  and  practices  with  regard  to  the  construction, \nremediation, and maintenance of curb ramps that provide access to the \nCity’s pedestrian right of way. \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 43 of 54\n65.  Defendant has not adopted and does not enforce appropriate administrative \nmethods,  policies,  procedures,  and/or  practices  to  ensure  that  it  is  in \ncompliance with the ADA and Section 504 to ensure nondiscrimination \nagainst persons with mobility disabilities and equal access to facilities, \nprograms, services, and activities for persons with mobility disabilities. \n66.  The violations of the ADA and Section 504 set forth in detail herein have \ninjured all members of the proposed class and violated their rights in a \nsimilar way. \n67.  Defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive or declaratory relief \nwith respect to the class as a whole. Class claims are brought for the \npurposes of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief only. \n68.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class in that \nthey arise from the same course of conduct engaged in by Defendant. The \nrelief sought herein will benefit all class members alike. \n69.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass. They have no interests adverse to the interests of other members of \nthe class and have retained counsel who is competent and experienced in \nlitigating actions under the ADA in Puerto Rico. \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 44 of 54\n70.  The requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are \nmet with regard to the proposed class in that: \ni.  The class is so numerous that it would be impractical to bring all \nclass members before the Court; \nii.  There are questions of law and fact which are common to the class; \niii.  The Named Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief \nare typical of the claims of the class; \niv.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent common \nclass interests and are represented by counsel who are experienced \nin law reform class actions and the disability rights issues in this \ncase; and \nv.  Defendant  has  acted  or  refused  to  act  on  grounds  generally \napplicable to the class. \n71.  The common questions of law and fact, shared by the Named Plaintiffs and \nall class members, include but are not limited to: \ni.  Whether Defendant is violating Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \nsections 12131, et seq., by failing to install or remediate curb ramps \nthat make the City’s pedestrian right of way program, service, or \nactivity  accessible  to  and  useable  by  persons  with  mobility \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 45 of 54\ndisabilities,  and  otherwise  discriminating  against  persons  with \nmobility disabilities, as set forth above; \nii.  Whether Defendant is violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. section 794 et seq., by failing to install or remediate \ncurb ramps that make the City’s pedestrian right of way program, \nservice,  or  activity  accessible  to  and  useable  by  persons  with \nmobility disabilities, and otherwise discriminating against people \nwith mobility disabilities, as set forth above; \niii.  Whether  Defendant  has  performed  “new  construction”  and/or \n“alterations”  to  the  City’s  pedestrian  right  of  way  within  the \nmeaning of 28 C.F.R. § 35.151, triggering an obligation to construct \nor retrofit curb ramps; Whether Defendant has performed “new \nconstruction” and/or “alterations” to the City’s pedestrian right of \nway  within  the  meaning  of  45  C.F.R.  §  84.23,  triggering  an \nobligation to construct or retrofit curb ramps; \niv.  Whether Defendant, by its actions and omissions alleged herein, has \nengaged in a pattern or practice of discriminating against Plaintiffs \nand  other  persons  with  mobility  disabilities  in  violation  of \napplicable federal and state disability access laws. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 46 of 54\n42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. \n \n72.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \nthe foregoing paragraphs. \n73.  Title II of the ADA provides in pertinent part: “[N]o qualified individual \nwith a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n74.  At all times relevant to this action, the City was and is a “public entity” \nwithin the meaning of Title II of the ADA and provides a pedestrian right \nof way program, service, or activity to the general public. \n75.  At  all  times  relevant  to  this  action,  Plaintiffs  were  and  are  qualified \nindividuals with disabilities within the meaning of Title II of the ADA and \nmeet the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the services, \nprograms, or activities of the City. 42 U.S.C. § 12131. \n76.  Defendant is mandated to operate each program, service, or activity “so \nthat, when viewed in its entirety, it is readily accessible to and useable by \nindividuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150; see also 28 C.F.R. §§ \n35.149. This requirement applies to all programs, services, and activities \nthat a public entity offers, whether or not they are carried out in facilities \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 47 of 54\nthat have been constructed or altered since January 26, 1992. Pedestrian \nrights of way themselves constitute a vital public program, service, or \nactivity under Title II of the ADA. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104; Barden v. City of \nSacramento, 292 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002); Procurador De Personas Con \nImpedimentos v. Municipality of San Juan, 541 F.Supp.2d 468, 471-73 \n(DPR 2008). \n77.  Furthermore, the regulations implementing Title II of the ADA specifically \nprovide  that  a  public  entity  must  install  curb  ramps  at  intersections \nwhenever it newly constructs or alters sidewalks, streets, roads, and/or \nhighways  at  any  time  after  January  26,  1992  and  must  comply  with \nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) or with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities \n(ADAAG). 28 C.F.R. § 35.151. A street resurfacing project by a public \nentity is one example of an alteration under the meaning of the regulation. \nKinney v. Yerusalim, 9 F.3d 1067, 1073-74 (3rd Cir. 1993); Lonberg v. \nCity of Riverside, No. 97-CV-0237, 2007 WL 2005177, at * 6 (C.D. Cal. \n2007). \n78.  The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide that a public \nentity must maintain the features of all facilities required to be accessible \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 48 of 54\nby the ADA. 28 C.F.R. § 35.133. Facilities required to be accessible \ninclude roads, walks, and passageways. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n79.  Due to the lack of accessible curb ramps as alleged above, as well as \nDefendant’s failure to conduct a timely Self Evaluation and implement a \nTransition Plan for the pedestrian right of way, the City’s pedestrian right \nof way is not fully, equally, or meaningfully accessible to Plaintiffs when \nviewed  in  its  entirety.  Defendant  has  therefore  violated  the  “program \naccess” obligation applicable to pedestrian right of way facilities that have \nnot been newly constructed or altered since January 26, 1992. \n80.  Additionally, the sidewalks, cross walks, and other walkways at issue \nconstitute facilities within the meaning of ADAAG and UFAS. Plaintiffs \nare informed, believe, and thereon allege that since January 26, 1992, \nDefendant has constructed, altered, or repaired parts of these facilities \nwithin the meaning of the ADAAG and the UFAS, and that Defendant, \nthrough its administrative methods, policies, and practices, has failed \nto make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by persons with \ndisabilities through the construction and retrofit of curb ramps as \nrequired under federal accessibility standards and guidelines. \n81.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereon allege that since March 15, \n2012,  Defendant  has  constructed,  altered,  or  repaired  parts  of  these \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 49 of 54\nfacilities within the meaning of the ADAAG and the UFAS, and that \nDefendant, through its administrative methods, policies, and practices, has \nfailed to make such facilities compliant with the ADAAG and the UFAS \nas updated in 2010, as required under 28 C.F.R. 35.151(c)(5). \n82.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereon allege that Defendant and its \nagents and employees have violated and continue to violate Title II of the \nADA by failing to maintain the features of the City’s walkways and curb \nramps that are required to be accessible. \n83.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereon allege that Defendant and its \nagents and employees have violated and continue to violate Title II of the \nADA by failing to timely respond to and remedy complaints regarding the \nlack of accessible curb ramps necessary to ensure access to the City’s \npedestrian right of way. \n84.  The ADA’s regulations at 43 C.F.R. §17.550(a)(3) prevent public entities \nfrom refusing to comply with their obligations to provide persons with \ndisabilities meaningful access to their programs and services by claiming \nthat doing so would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, \nunless such a determination is made by an agency head or his or her \ndesignee after consulting all agency resources available for use in the \nfunding  and  operation  of  the  conducted  program  or  activity  and  the \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 50 of 54\ndetermination is accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for \nreaching that conclusion. On information and belief, the City, through its \nagency heads and/or designees, has failed to make such a determination \naccompanied by the required written statement and has, therefore, failed to \ndemonstrate that providing the access Plaintiffs seek to its pedestrian right \nof way would impose an undue financial or administrative burden. \n85.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered and continue to suffer difficulty, hardship, anxiety, and danger, \ndue to Defendant’s failure to remediate missing, defective, Inaccessible \ncurb ramps throughout the City’s pedestrian right of way. These failures \nhave denied and continue to deny Plaintiffs the full, equal, and meaningful \naccess to the pedestrian right of way that the ADA requires. \n86.  Because  Defendant’s  discriminatory  conduct  presents  a  real  and \nimmediate threat of current and continuing future violations, declaratory \nand injunctive relief are appropriate remedies. \n87.  Pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  12133  and  12205,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, \nexpert expenses, and costs incurred in bringing this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as set forth below. \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 51 of 54\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n \n88.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \nthe foregoing paragraphs. \n89.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides in pertinent part: \n“[N]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by \nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving federal financial assistance . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n90.  Plaintiffs are otherwise qualified to participate in the services, programs, \nor activities that are provided to individuals in the City. See 29 U.S.C. § \n794(b). \n91.  The City is a direct recipient of federal financial assistance sufficient to \ninvoke the coverage of Section 504, and has received such federal financial \nassistance at all times relevant to the claims asserted in this Complaint. \n92.  Defendant and its agents and employees have violated and continue to \nviolate the Rehabilitation Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder \nby  excluding  Plaintiffs  from  participation  in,  denying  Plaintiffs  the \nbenefits  of,  and  subjecting  Plaintiffs  based  solely  by  reason  of  their \ndisability  to,  discrimination  in  the  benefits  and  services  of  the  City’s \npedestrian right of way and for the reasons set forth above. \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 52 of 54\n93.  Additionally, under Section 504, a recipient of federal financial assistance \nmust install ADAAG- or UFAS-compliant curb ramps at intersections \nwhenever it newly constructs or alters sidewalks, streets, roads, and/or \nhighways at any time after June 3, 1977. Willits v. City of Los Angeles, \n925 F. Supp. 2d. 1089, 1094 (C.D. Cal. 2013). Defendant has violated \nSection 504 by failing to construct or install such compliant curb ramps at \nintersections throughout the City where it has newly constructed or altered \nstreets, roads, and/or highways since June 3, 1977.  \n94.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs \nsuffered and continue to suffer difficulty, hardship, anxiety, and danger \ndue to Defendant’s failure to remediate missing, defective, Inaccessible \ncurb ramps throughout the City’s pedestrian right of way. These failures \nhave  denied  Plaintiffs  the  full,  equal,  and  meaningful  access  to  the \npedestrian right of way that Section 504 requires. \n95.  Because  Defendant’s  discriminatory  conduct  presents  a  real  and \nimmediate threat of current and continuing violations, declaratory and \ninjunctive relief are appropriate remedies. \n96.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a, Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, and to recover from Defendant the reasonable attorneys’ \nfees and costs incurred in bringing this action. \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 53 of 54\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as set forth below. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request judgment as follows: \nA. A declaration that Defendant’s conduct as alleged herein has violated and \ncontinues to violate Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the regulations \npromulgated under those statutes; \nB. Issuance  of  permanent  injunction  requiring  Defendant  to  undertake \nremedial measures to mitigate the effects of Defendant’s past and ongoing \nviolations of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \nand  the  regulations  promulgated  under  those  statutes.  At  a  minimum, \nDefendant must be enjoined to take the following actions: \ni.  Ensure that the City install, remediate, repair, and maintain curb \nramps such that, when viewed in its entirety, the City’s pedestrian \nright of way is readily accessible to and useable by individuals with \nmobility disabilities;  \nii.  Ensure prompt remedial measures to cure past violations of the \nCity’s requirements to construct or alter curb ramps as required by \nthe new construction and alteration obligations of Title II of the \nADA, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.151(a), (b), (c) or (i), and Section 504, 45 \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 11   Filed 12/05/19   Page 54 of 54\nC.F.R. §§ 84.22, and the curb ramp design standards in effect at the \ntime of such new construction or alterations; \niii.  Ensure that all future new construction and alterations to the City’s \ncurb  ramps  fully  comply  with  the  2010  ADA  Standards  for \nAccessible Design, or other federal and Puerto Rico disability access \ndesign standards, whichever is most stringent in its disability access \nrequirements; \niv.  Ensure  that  Defendant  adopts  and  implements  administrative \nmethods, policies, and practices to maintain accessible curb ramps; \nand \nv.  Remain  under  this  Court’s  jurisdiction  until  Defendant  fully \ncomplies with the Orders of this Court; \nC. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, as provided by law; and \nD.

Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1-4, 11, ECF No. 11.  On September 1, \n2020, the Court denied the Municipality’s motion to dismiss, finding the plaintiffs had \nadequately pled their claims under Title II of the ADA by at minimum alleging that the \ninaccessibility of sidewalks in San Juan affects their ability to access other covered services, \nprograms, or activities.  Order 8, ECF No. 17.  The Court requested that the parties submit \nfurther briefing addressing whether sidewalks themselves are “services” under Title II of the \nADA.  Id. at 9.   \n  The United States respectfully files this Statement of Interest to assert its long-held \nposition, endorsed by multiple circuit courts, that a public entity’s provision and maintenance of \nsidewalks qualifies as a service, program, or activity under Title II of the ADA; and to explain \nwhy this position is supported by the statute’s plain language and its implementing regulations. \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nThe United States submits this Statement of Interest because this litigation implicates the \nproper interpretation and application of Title II of the ADA.1  As the federal agency charged with \nenforcement and implementation of Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12133-12134, the \nDepartment of Justice has an interest in supporting the proper and uniform application of the \n                                                 \n1 The Attorney General is authorized “to attend to the interests of the United States” in any case \npending in federal court.  28 U.S.C. § 517. \n1 \n \n\nADA, in furthering Congress’s intent to create “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards \naddressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities,” 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (b)(2), and in \nfurthering Congress’s intent to reserve a “central role” for the federal Government in enforcing \nthe standards established in the ADA.  Id. § 12101 (b)(3).  The United States has previously \naddressed the issue presented in this case in Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. \n2011) and Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002).2    \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUE \nWhether a public entity’s provision and maintenance of public sidewalks is a covered \nservice, program, or activity under Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe facts and procedural history are set forth in the Court’s September 1, 2020, Order.  In \nthe interest of brevity, the United States does not repeat them here. \nARGUMENT \nTHE PROVISION AND MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC SIDEWALKS IS A SERVICE, \nPROGRAM, OR ACTIVITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF TITLE II \n \nA municipality’s provision and maintenance of sidewalks constitutes a service, program, \nor activity under Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  San Juan’s argument to the contrary, \nsee Mot. to Dismiss 13-20, ECF No. 14; Def.’s Mem. in Compliance with Order 2-10, ECF \nNo. 19, runs counter to the plain language of the statute.  It directly conflicts with the Fifth \nCircuit’s en banc decision in Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011), and the \nNinth Circuit’s ruling in Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002).  It is \n                                                 \n2 See Br. for U.S. as Amicus Curiae in Supp. of Appellants, Barden v. City of Sacramento, 292 \nF.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2002) (No. 01–15744), 2001 WL 34095025; Br. for U.S. as Amicus Curiae \nSupp’g Appellants’ Pet. for Reh’g En Banc, Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. \n2011) (No. 08-10630), 2010 WL 5306469.  \n2 \n \n\ninconsistent with the holdings of other circuits that Title II applies to virtually anything a state or \nlocal government does.  Johnson v. City of Saline, 151 F.3d 564, 569 (6th Cir. 1998); Yeskey v. \nPennsylvania Dep’t of Corr., 118 F.3d 168, 170-71 (3rd Cir. 1997), aff’d, 524 U.S. 206 (1998); \nInnovative Health Sys. Inc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 44-45 (2d Cir. 1997), \nsuperseded on other grounds, Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 171 n.7 (2d Cir. \n2001).  And it is inconsistent with Title II’s implementing regulations.   \nA.  The Statutory Text Is Clear \nTitle II of the ADA prohibits public entities from denying individuals with disabilities \n“the benefits of” any “service,” “program” or “activity” on the basis of disability.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, those statutory terms are unambiguously broad.  \nSee Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998).  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act specifically defines the term “program or activity” as “all of the operations \nof” a covered public entity, 29 U.S.C. § 794(b) (emphasis added), and Congress required Title II \nto be interpreted at least as broadly as Section 504, see 42 U.S.C. § 12201(a).  \nGenerally speaking, provision and maintenance of a system of sidewalks for pedestrians \nto move about for personal, commercial, or other reasons is a “service” that a city provides to its \nresidents.  Indeed, it is one of the most fundamental services provided by any municipality. The \nprovision of that service is dependent on government “activities” ranging from the initial \nconstruction of the sidewalks to the maintenance of the sidewalks.  In most cases, the provision \nof that service likely is undertaken as part of a city “program.”  When an individual with a \ndisability is denied the use of a city sidewalk system because the sidewalks are inaccessible to \nindividuals with disabilities, he or she is “excluded from” and “denied the benefits of” the \n3 \n \n\n“services, programs, or activities of a public entity,” and “subjected to discrimination by [that] \nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nProviding and maintaining a network of walkways for pedestrians to get around town is a \nquintessential, not to mention ages old, government service.  As the Ninth Circuit held in \nBarden, “maintenance of public sidewalks . . . is a normal function of a municipal entity.”  292 \nF.3d at 1077; see also Frame 657 F.3d at 227 (“[A] public sidewalk itself . . . unambiguously is a \nservice, program, or activity of a public entity.  A city sidewalk facilitates the public’s \nconvenience and benefit by affording a means of safe transportation.”) (emphasis in original, \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  And, as the Supreme Court has recognized in another context, \nthe provision of sidewalks is an archetypal “general government service[].”  Everson v. Board of \nEduc, 330 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1947) (noting that there is no Establishment Clause difficulty in giving \nchurches access to “such general government services as ordinary police and fire protection, \nconnections for sewage disposal, public highways and sidewalks”).  Sidewalks permit the public \nto stay clear of road traffic and to access shops and businesses, means of public transportation, \nplaces of employment, and government offices and facilities.  Sidewalks have also been used \nsince “time out of mind,” for the purpose of public association and speech.  Boos v. Barry, 485 \nU.S. 312, 318 (1988) (quoting Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.)). \nBy its plain terms, Title II of the ADA covers the sidewalks and curbs at issue in this \ncase.  See Barden, 292 F.3d at 1076 (“Maintaining the[] accessibility [of public sidewalks] for \nindividuals with disabilities . . . falls within the scope of Title II.”); see also Cohen v. City of \nCulver City, 754 F.3d 690, 695 (9th Cir. 2014) (“We construe the language of the ADA broadly \nto advance its remedial purpose . . . . A city sidewalk is therefore a ‘service, program, or activity’ \nof a public entity within the meaning of Title II.”) (internal citations omitted); Frame, 657 F.3d \n4 \n \n\nat 223 (“Based on statutory text and structure, we hold that Title II and § 504 unambiguously \nextend to newly built and altered public sidewalks.”).  While the application of Title II to public \nsidewalks is clear from the statutory text alone, this interpretation is further affirmed by \nexamination of the statute’s implementing regulations.  \nB.  The Title II Regulations Support this Interpretation \nTitle II regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice state that “[n]o qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, . . . be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a).  Applying this \ngeneral prohibition to facilities, the regulations provide that no one with a covered disability \n“shall, because a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with \ndisabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.149.  The regulations expressly define \n“facility” to include “roads” and “walks” controlled by a public entity.  28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \nFurthermore, the Title II regulations specifically recognize the ADA’s application to \npublic sidewalks.  The regulations provide that newly constructed or altered streets and \npedestrian walkways “must contain curb ramps.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i).  They also require \npublic entities with responsibility over existing sidewalks to develop a transition plan for \ninstalling curb ramps by a certain date for walkways serving entities covered by the ADA and \nwalkways serving “other areas.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d)(2).  As the Department of Justice \nexplained in the regulatory guidance accompanying the Title II regulations, the curb ramp \nrequirements were premised on the view that “[t]he employment, transportation, and public \naccommodation sections of . . . [the ADA] would be meaningless if people who use wheelchairs \n5 \n \n\nwere not afforded the opportunity to travel on and between the streets.”3  28 C.F.R. Part 35, App. \nB at § 35.150 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990)) (emphasis added).  As this \nregulatory guidance and the regulations themselves make clear, a public entity’s provision and \nmaintenance of sidewalks is a covered program, service, or activity under Title II. \nC.  San Juan’s Interpretation of Title II is Incorrect \nIn its motion to dismiss, San Juan asserted that the only way plaintiffs can prove a \nviolation of Title II of the ADA based on the inaccessibility of the Municipality’s sidewalks is by \nestablishing that inaccessible sidewalks denied them access to other public services, programs, or \nactivities.  ECF No. 14 at 14; see also ECF 19 at 4-5.  In support of this argument, San Juan \nrelies primarily on reasoning in a since vacated Fifth Circuit opinion, Frame v. City of Arlington, \n616 F.3d 476 (5th Cir. 2010), vacated, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011).  In that opinion, the panel \nmajority found that the relevant statutory language in Title II was ambiguous, and for that reason \nturned to the supporting regulations.  Id. at 482.  The panel majority explained that facilities, \nincluding sidewalks, are addressed in the general provision regarding program accessibility, 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.149, and elaborated upon in subsequent provisions, 28 C.F.R. § 35.150-151.  Id. at \n486-87.  It then concluded, based on its examination of these provisions, that “sidewalks, curbs, \nand parking lots” are “facilities,” and thus are not “services, programs, or activities.”  Id. at 480, \n487-88. \n                                                 \n3 This guidance issued in the course of notice-and-comment rulemaking reflects the “agency’s \nauthoritative, expertise-based, fair, [and] considered judgment” about the basis for Title II’s curb \nramp requirements.  See Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2414 (2019) (quoting Auer v. Robbins, \n519 U.S. 452, 462 (1997)).  Under these circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has \nheld that courts should defer to the Department’s interpretation of its own regulation.  See id.; see \nalso id. at 2410, 2413 (using the Department’s concurrent regulatory guidance to the ADA as an \nexample of where Auer deference applies).  “When it applies, Auer deference gives an agency \nsignificant leeway to say what its own rules mean.”  Id. at 2418. \n6 \n \n\nThis conclusion and reasoning have since been rejected and vacated by the Fifth Circuit \nsitting en banc, see Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2011), and justifiably so.  \nThe regulations clearly indicate that facilities are a subset of services, programs, or activities. \nThe two are not, as the earlier panel majority contended, mutually exclusive categories. \n   The regulations simply explain how Title II of the ADA applies when the service, \nprogram, or activity is a facility, or takes place in a facility.  Section 35.149 of the regulations \nprovides that, generally, facilities must be made accessible so that individuals with disabilities \ncan enjoy a public entity’s services, programs, and activities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.149.  Section \n35.150 provides an exception to the general requirement of immediate accessibility for existing \nfacilities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150; 28 C.F.R. § 35.149 (indicating that the requirements of \nSection 35.149 apply “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in [Section] 35.150”).  Section 35.151 \napplies to newly constructed or altered facilities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.151. \n   Perhaps the clearest indication that all sidewalks are covered comes from Section \n35.150(d)(2), which provides as follows: \nIf a public entity has responsibility or authority over streets, roads, or walkways, its \ntransition plan shall include a schedule for providing curb ramps or other sloped areas \nwhere pedestrian walks cross curbs, giving priority to walkways serving entities covered \nby the Act, including State and local government offices and facilities, transportation, \nplaces of public accommodation, and employers, followed by walkways serving other \nareas. \n \n28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d)(2) (emphasis added).  The regulation clearly contemplates that curb ramps \nwill be installed for sidewalks providing access to facilities covered by Title II of the ADA, \nwhich presumably would be covered even under San Juan’s proposed approach.  But it also \ncontemplates that they will be installed for sidewalks providing access to “places of public \naccommodation” (covered under Title III), “employers” (covered under Title I), and “other \nareas” as well, which according to San Juan, would not be covered.  As the Ninth Circuit held in \n7 \n \n\nBarden, “Section 35.150’s requirement of curb ramps in all pedestrian walkways reveals a \ngeneral concern for the accessibility of public sidewalks, as well as a recognition that sidewalks \nfall within the ADA’s coverage, and would be meaningless if the sidewalks between the curb \nramps were inaccessible.”  292 F.3d at 1077.  \n   This interpretation is further supported by Section 35.151.  The provisions in Section \n35.151 that address curb ramps contain no requirement that the “[n]ewly constructed or altered \nstreets, roads, and highways,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i)(1), or the “[n]ewly constructed or altered \nstreet level pedestrian walkways,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i)(2), at issue serve as a gateway to a \nservice, program, or activity in order to be covered by Title II.  Rather, a straightforward reading \nof Section 35.151(i) reinforces the conclusion that all such streets, roads, highways, and \npedestrian walkways are covered.  Making accessible only the walkways that serve as gateways \nwould often be meaningless if those with disabilities could not get to them because their \nresidential walkways are not accessible. \n   Moreover, as the Fifth Circuit noted in its en banc opinion in Frame, “limiting Title II’s \nprivate right of action to sidewalks that serve as gateways to other public services, programs, or \nactivities would create an unworkable and arbitrary standard.”  657 F.3d at 235.  It would lead to \ndifficult line-drawing problems with regard to whether a particular sidewalk is sufficiently \nrelated to a service, program, or activity to be covered by Title II and thus “would undermine the \nADA’s purpose of providing ‘clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.’” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2)); see \nalso Barden, 292 F.3d at 1076 (“Attempting to distinguish which public functions are services, \nprograms, or activities, and which are not, would disintegrate into needless hair-splitting \narguments.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n8 \n \n\n   The inquiry should focus “not so much on whether a particular public function can \ntechnically be characterized as a service, program, or activity, but whether it is a normal function \nof a governmental entity.”  Barden, 292 F.3d at 1076 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also \nYeskey, 524 U.S. at 210-11 (Title II’s unambiguous statutory language demonstrates its broad \ncoverage, extending to prisons even if the statute does not mention prisons).  Such an inquiry is \nmore consistent with the broad statutory terms used by Congress in Title II, which aim “to \nprovide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2); see also Barden, 292 F.3d at 1077.  That \nmandate would not be served by the limited, haphazard patchwork of covered sidewalks that \nwould result from the approach advanced by San Juan.   \nIn addition to attempting to find support for its position in the now vacated panel decision \nin Frame, San Juan also relies on the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Babcock v. Michigan, 812 F.3d \n531 (6th Cir. 2016).  This reliance is misplaced. \nThe court in Babcock did not, as San Juan suggests, conclude that sidewalks cannot be a \n“service” under Title II.  The Babcock majority explicitly noted it was not tasked, as was the \nFifth Circuit in Frame, with determining whether sidewalks are services.  Babcock, 812 F.3d at \n538 n.5.  Rather, it was asked to decide “whether certain design features in a building—for \nexample handrails at entrances—qualify as a ‘service’.”  Id.   While the court concluded that the \ndesign features at issue were not services4, it acknowledged that such features “do not satisfy a \n‘general demand’ for ‘safe transportation’ in the same way that a sidewalk does” nor are they \n“ordinarily ‘provided in common to all citizens.’”  Id. (quoting Frame, 657 F.3d at 226-27).  As \n                                                 \n4 The United States does not take a position as to whether this conclusion is correct as this case \ndoes not require the Court to address this question. \n \n9 \n \n\nJudge Rogers noted in his concurrence, the Babcock majority’s opinion thereby acknowledged \nthat sidewalks may qualify as “services” under Title II and left in place prior Sixth Circuit \nprecedent supporting such a conclusion.  Id. at 543 (Rogers, J., concurring)5; see also Madej v. \nMaiden, 951 F.3d 364, 373 (6th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 2020 WL 6037415 (U.S. Oct. 13, 2020) \n(“Babcock involved the ‘design features in a building’ and suggested that those facts might \ndistinguish it from a case that found a transportation facility (a sidewalk) covered.”) \n Indeed, district courts in the Sixth Circuit have subsequently found that sidewalks are \ncovered by Title II and that their conclusions are consistent with the reasoning in Babcock.  See \nMichigan Paralyzed Veterans of Am., Inc. v. Michigan Dep’t of Transportation, No. 15-13046, \n2017 WL 5132912, at *11 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 6, 2017) (“Not only did the Sixth Circuit \nin Babcock leave open the possibility that sidewalks could be considered “services, programs, or \nactivities” under the ADA—it strongly suggested this conclusion, which this Court reaches \ntoday.”); Mote v. City of Chelsea, 284 F. Supp. 3d 863, 883 (E.D. Mich. 2018) (“Even if the \nsidewalks at issue were not “facilities” subject to the ADA, the program of building and \nmaintaining sidewalks certainly is a “service” provided by the defendant by any coherent \ninterpretation of that term.”).  District courts in other circuits have also found sidewalks to be a \ncovered service under Title II of the ADA.  See Hamer v. City of Trinidad, No. 16-02545, 2020 \nWL 869818, at *6–12 (D. Colo. Feb. 21, 2020) (holding maintenance of public sidewalks is a \n“service” covered under Title II); Willits v. City of Los Angeles, 925 F. Supp. 2d 1089, 1093 \n                                                 \n5 The earlier opinion referred to by Judge Rogers is Ability Center of Greater Toledo v. City of \nSandusky, 385 F.3d 901 (6th Cir. 2004), in which the Sixth Circuit held that 28 C.F.R. § 35.151 \nis enforceable through a private cause of action, id. at 907, and acknowledged that the defendants \ndid “not dispute the district court’s finding that they failed to comply with § 35.151” by failing to \ninstall accessible sidewalks throughout the city.  Id. at 904; see also Babcock 657 F.3d at 543 \n(Rogers, J., concurring) (“Nothing in [Ability Center] cast doubt on the fact that a city’s failure to \nproperly construct sidewalks violates 28 C.F.R. § 35.151 and 42 U.S.C § 12132.”). \n10 \n \n\n(C.D. Cal. 2013) (same); Culvahouse v. City of LaPorte, 679 F. Supp. 2d 931, 939 (N.D. Ind. \n2009) (same). \nFinally, San Juan looks to two First Circuit decisions, Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d \n94 (1st Cir. 2006) and Parker v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 225 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2000), for \nsupport.  As the Municipality acknowledges, however, there are no First Circuit cases directly on \npoint.  ECF No. 14 at 14; ECF No. 19 at 5.  The question in Iverson was whether the Title II \nregulations requiring entities to conduct a self-evaluation and make a transition plan are \nenforceable through a private right of action—the court held that they were not.  452 F.3d at 96.  \nIn Parker, the First Circuit found that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case that he was \ndenied access to the University of Puerto Rico’s “services, programs, or activities” when his \nwheelchair overturned during a visit to the University’s Botanical Gardens because of an alleged \ndefect on the path, causing him injury.  225 F.3d at 5, 3.  The court held that the University had \nan obligation to make the Garden accessible, and to provide at least one route to the garden that \ncould be used safely by an individual in a wheelchair.  Id. at 6-7.  In neither Iverson nor Parker \ndid the First Circuit provide an opinion on whether sidewalks themselves are services under Title \nII of the ADA. \nIn sum, San Juan’s position is not supported.  It runs counter to the plain statutory \nlanguage of Title II of the ADA, the statute’s administrative interpretation, and circuit court \nprecedent, all of which point to the conclusion that the provision and maintenance of sidewalks is \namong the “services, programs, or activities” that public entities must make accessible under \nTitle II.  \n11 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \nThe United States respectfully requests that the Court consider this Statement of Interest \nin this litigation. \n \nDate:   November 9, 2020         Respectfully submitted, \n   \nW.

      "text": "Case 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 204   Filed 08/01/23   Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO \nFAUSTINO XAVIER BETANCOURT-\nCOLÓN, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nCITY OF SAN JUAN, a public entity also \nknown as the Municipality of San Juan, \nDefendant. \nCase No. 19-cv-1837-JAG-GLS \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \nPlaintiff-Intervenor, \nv. \nCITY OF SAN JUAN, a public entity also \nknown as the Municipality of San Juan, \nDefendant.\nSTIPULATED ORDER \n1. On December 12, 2020, the Court stayed all proceedings in this case and referred the \nParties to Magistrate Judge Giselle López-Soler for mediation. Docket No. 29.  In \nfurtherance of their efforts to reach a mediated resolution, the undersigned Parties \nHEREBY STIPULATE AND AGREE that the stay should remain in place for thirty-six\n(36) months from the date of this Order on the below terms and conditions.\nA. Training\n2. Within two (2) months of the date of this Order, San Juan will train all Municipal\nemployees who supervise construction, repair, or maintenance work related to the “Public\nSidewalk System” (i.e., all sidewalks, curb ramps, crosswalks, and any other similar\npedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way within San Juan, excluding locations over\nwhich the Municipality has no legal authority or control) on all applicable Americans\nwith Disabilities Act Accessibility Standards.  The training will be conducted by\nEngineer Luis Tirado.  San Juan will provide Engineer Tirado’s proposed training\nmaterials to the United States at least one (1) month in advance of the training being\nconducted and will make good faith efforts to address any edits or suggestions provided\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 204   Filed 08/01/23   Page 2 of 8\nby the United States.  Any edits or suggestions provided by the United States must be \nprovided to Engineer Tirado no later than ten (10) days prior to the date of the first \ntraining.  San Juan will provide notice of when the first training will be held pursuant to \nthis section so that the United States may attend. \n3. Following entry of this Order, any additional employees hired by San Juan who supervise\nconstruction, repair, or maintenance work related to the Public Sidewalk System must be\ntrained on all applicable ADA Accessibility Standards within one (1) month of beginning\nemployment.\n4. San Juan will maintain records of the names, job titles, and dates of attendance for all\nindividuals trained pursuant to this section and will provide copies of that information to\nthe United States upon request.\nB. Barrier Reporting Process\n5. Within six (6) months of the date of this Order, the Municipality will develop,\nimplement, and report to the United States a process for soliciting and receiving input\nfrom persons with disabilities, and others, regarding the accessibility of the Public\nSidewalk System.  At minimum, this process will include that San Juan will:\na. Provide in a conspicuous location on the Municipality’s homepage a link to an\nelectronic form in an Accessible Format (i.e., that conforms to the Web Content\nAccessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA) by which individuals can report\naccessibility barriers in the Public Sidewalk System.  This form will include\noptions to request to install or repair curb ramps and/or sidewalks at particular\nlocations.  The Municipality will also accept barrier reports and other input about\nthe accessibility of the Public Sidewalk System via other methods (in-person,\nphone, etc.); and\nb. Record and maintain all data received or created during this process (including\nreports and any responses to reports) in a centralized, electronic format and\nprovide that data to the United States upon request.\nC. Public Sidewalk System Assessment\n6. Accessibility Consultant:  Within six (6) months of the date of this Order, the\nMunicipality will retain a third-party Accessibility Consultant to conduct a self-\nassessment that accurately identifies any barriers to people with disabilities within the\nPublic Sidewalk System, in accordance with the ADA Accessibility Standards.  During\nthe procurement process, additional weight will be assigned to every potential Consultant\nthat has successfully conducted a comparable ADA accessibility assessment of the\nsidewalks and/or curb ramps in a city of at least 20,000 people.  The weight assigned to\nthis prior assessment criterion must be equal to the weight assigned to any other criterion\nand must account for at least 15% of the total evaluation points available.  Within (1)\nmonth of the date of this Order, the Municipality will share a draft of any RFP it intends\nto issue to solicit Consultant bids.  The United States may provide any comments or\nsuggestions it has on the RFP within three (3) weeks of receipt and the Municipality will\n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 204   Filed 08/01/23   Page 3 of 8\nwork in good faith to consider the United States’ input.  The RFP notice shall be issued in \nEnglish and Spanish.  Following the Municipality’s selection of a Consultant, but at least \none (1) month before the contract with the Consultant is executed, the Municipality will \nprovide the United States with information about the proposed Consultant’s credentials, \ntheir experience conducting comparable assessments, and the methodology and \ntechnological tools they have proposed to conduct the Assessment.  If the United States \nobjects to the Municipality’s proposed Consultant, the Parties will attempt to resolve the \ndisagreement in good faith pursuant to the dispute resolution process in Paragraph 18.  \nSan Juan will bear all costs and expenses of retaining the Consultant.   \n7. Assessment Report:  The Assessment Consultant will produce a written Assessment\nReport that identifies all elements of the Public Sidewalk System that are within the\nMunicipality’s control and that are not in compliance with the ADA Accessibility\nStandards.  The Assessment will be limited to locations over which the Municipality has\nlegal authority and control.  The Assessment will, however, include identification of\naccessibility barriers in the Public Sidewalk System caused by other entities, including\nutility poles and electric company boxes.\n8. Remediation Priorities:  The Accessibility Consultant will also recommend an approach\nto completing the remediation that prioritizes: (a) providing access to Municipal and\nother government offices and facilities, transportation terminals, places of public\naccommodation, and employers, consistent with the priorities outlined in 28 C.F.R.\n§35.150(d)(2); and (b) responding to requests or input provided by people with\ndisabilities through the Barrier Reporting Process and other means.\n9. Periodic Status Conferences:  Three (3) months after the retention of the Accessibility\nConsultant, and every three (3) months thereafter, the Court will hold virtual status\nconferences at which the Parties will be present along with a representative for the\nAccessibility Consultant.  At these conferences, the Municipality and the Consultant will\nprovide written updates on the status and progress of the Assessment and copies of the\ndata collected to date.  The Parties will make themselves available to meet and confer (in\nperson or remotely) more frequently as needed.\n10. Completion:  The Municipality will complete the Assessment within thirty (30) months\nof the date of this Order and will provide a copy to the United States.  San Juan will also\npost a link in a conspicuous location on the Municipality’s homepage to a copy of the\nAssessment in an Accessible Format on the Municipality’s website.\nD. Ongoing Remediation and Future Construction or Alteration\n11. The United States acknowledges that the Municipality has already allocated\n$3,100,000.00 for the repair and replacement of elements of the Public Sidewalk System.\n12. Following entry of this Order, the Municipality will ensure that whenever it constructs or\nalters elements of the Public Sidewalk System, any sidewalks, curb ramps, crosswalks or\nother pedestrian facilities affected by the construction or alteration will be made\ncompliant with the ADA Accessibility Standards (consistent with the elements identified\nin Attachment A).  The Municipality will also ensure that whenever it repaves or\n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 204   Filed 08/01/23   Page 4 of 8\nresurfaces roadways it complies with 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i) by providing compliant curb \nramps or other sloped areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry \nfrom a street level pedestrian walkway.  The Municipality will have six (6) months \nfollowing entry of this Order to enter into any contracts necessary to ensure that any \nrepavement or resurfacing work in progress as of the date of this Order complies with this \nrequirement.  \nE. Compliance Verification\n13. Subject Matter Experts:  All new construction, alterations, or repairs made by San Juan to\nthe Public Sidewalk System following entry of this Order must be inspected and certified\nas compliant with the ADA Accessibility Standards by an independent licensed architect,\nengineer, or otherwise professionally licensed Subject Matter Expert (SME) who has\nexpertise on the ADA Accessibility Standards.  SMEs may not be Municipal employees\nbut may be outside contractors who are also retained by the Municipality to conduct\narchitectural inspections.  San Juan will provide the curriculum vitae or resume for any\nSME it retains to the United States, upon request.  San Juan will not retain an SME to\ncertify the compliance of a Public Sidewalk System element if the SME, or their business\nassociates, was in any way involved in the design or construction of that specific element.\nThe Municipality will have ninety (90) days from the entry of this Order to retain an\nSME to comply with this section if it has not done so previously.\n14. Certification:  SMEs will certify the compliance of Public Sidewalk System elements\nwith the ADA Accessibility Standards by creating “Certificates of Compliance,”\nsubstantially similar in form and content to the certification forms in Attachment A, that\nidentify the element(s) being certified with sufficient specificity to provide notice to third\nparties of ADA compliance and will be accompanied by sufficient, conclusive evidence\nsupporting the certification including, but not limited to photographs showing pertinent\nmeasurements (such as slope and dimensional characteristics).  This information should\nbe compiled in a way that can be provided easily in an electronic format.\n15. Reporting and Technical Assistance:  San Juan will provide all Certificates of\nCompliance issued by SMEs to the United States upon request.  The United States may\nnotify San Juan if an SME submits Certificates that do not comply with the above\nrequirements.\nF. ADA Coordinator, Notice, and Grievance Procedure\n16. The Parties acknowledge that the Municipality has hired an ADA Coordinator.   Within\nthirty (30) days of the date of this Order, the Municipality will ensure that the ADA\nCoordinator’s contact information (name, office address, telephone number, and email\naddress) is posted in an Accessible Format in a conspicuous location on the\nMunicipality’s homepage.\n17. The Parties acknowledge that the Municipality has issued a Notice Under the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA Notice”) and has adopted an ADA Grievance Procedure.\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this Order, the Municipality will post the ADA\nNotice and ADA Grievance Procedure in an Accessible Format on the Municipality’s\n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01837-JAG-GLS   Document 204   Filed 08/01/23   Page 5 of 8\nwebsite with links to the documents in a conspicuous location on the homepage.   The \nMunicipality will distribute these documents to all of its agency heads, and will update, \nredistribute, and repost them whenever necessary to ensure their accuracy. \nG. Information Sharing and Collaboration\n18. The Parties will cooperate in good faith to share information relevant to compliance with\nthis Order.  If any Party believes that another Party has failed to comply with any\nprovision of this Order, it will provide written notice to all Parties of the alleged\nnoncompliance.  The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the alleged\nnoncompliance.  If, after twenty-one (21) days, the Parties have been unable to resolve\nthe dispute, any Party may file a motion with the Court to enforce this Order or seek other\nappropriate relief, including lifting the stay.\n19. Any provisions and time limits for performance imposed by this Order, including\ndeadlines for work to be completed by the Municipality, may be extended only with the\nCourt’s approval.  All Parties will, reasonably, in good faith, and without undue delay,\nconsider requests by other Parties to jointly move to extend deadlines agreed upon in this\nStipulated Order.  No Party shall be deemed to be in violation of this Order when its\nfailure to comply or delay in complying with a provision of the Order is caused by a force\nmajeure—i.e., an event or effect that the Party can neither anticipate nor control.  If the\nParties disagree upon whether an extension or delay is appropriate or warranted, they will\nattempt to resolve the dispute pursuant to the process in the preceding paragraph.\n20. This Order will remain in effect for thirty-six (36) months.  At least six (6) months prior\nto expiration of this Order, the Parties will meet and confer and propose dates to\nMagistrate Judge Giselle López-Soler for a further mediation session.  At the mediation,\nthe Parties will engage in good faith negotiations aimed at conclusively resolving this\nmatter in light of the information gathered in the Assessment.\n21. Nothing in this order should be construed as an admission by the Municipality that the\nPublic Sidewalk System is a service, consistent with the meaning of such term, in the\nADA.\nIT IS SO ORDERED this 1st day of August, 2023.\ns/ Jay A.

The training will be conducted by \nEngineer Luis Tirado.  San Juan will provide Engineer Tirado’s proposed training \nmaterials to the United States at least one (1) month in advance of the training being \nconducted and will make good faith efforts to address any edits or suggestions provided \n \n \n\n \nby the United States.  Any edits or suggestions provided by the United States must be \nprovided to Engineer Tirado no later than ten (10) days prior to the date of the first \ntraining.  San Juan will provide notice of when the first training will be held pursuant to \nthis section so that the United States may attend. \n3.  Following entry of this Order, any additional employees hired by San Juan who supervise \nconstruction, repair, or maintenance work related to the Public Sidewalk System must be \ntrained on all applicable ADA Accessibility Standards within one (1) month of beginning \nemployment.  \n4.  San Juan will maintain records of the names, job titles, and dates of attendance for all \nindividuals trained pursuant to this section and will provide copies of that information to \nthe United States upon request. \nB.  Barrier Reporting Process \n5.  Within six (6) months of the date of this Order, the Municipality will develop, \nimplement, and report to the United States a process for soliciting and receiving input \nfrom persons with disabilities, and others, regarding the accessibility of the Public \nSidewalk System.  At minimum, this process will include that San Juan will: \na.  Provide in a conspicuous location on the Municipality’s homepage a link to an \nelectronic form in an Accessible Format (i.e., that conforms to the Web Content \nAccessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA) by which individuals can report \naccessibility barriers in the Public Sidewalk System.  This form will include \noptions to request to install or repair curb ramps and/or sidewalks at particular \nlocations.  The Municipality will also accept barrier reports and other input about \nthe accessibility of the Public Sidewalk System via other methods (in-person, \nphone, etc.); and \nb.  Record and maintain all data received or created during this process (including \nreports and any responses to reports) in a centralized, electronic format and \nprovide that data to the United States upon request. \nC.  Public Sidewalk System Assessment \n6.  Accessibility Consultant:  Within six (6) months of the date of this Order, the \nMunicipality will retain a third-party Accessibility Consultant to conduct a self-\nassessment that accurately identifies any barriers to people with disabilities within the \nPublic Sidewalk System, in accordance with the ADA Accessibility Standards.  During \nthe procurement process, additional weight will be assigned to every potential Consultant \nthat has successfully conducted a comparable ADA accessibility assessment of the \nsidewalks and/or curb ramps in a city of at least 20,000 people.  The weight assigned to \nthis prior assessment criterion must be equal to the weight assigned to any other criterion \nand must account for at least 15% of the total evaluation points available.  Within (1) \nmonth of the date of this Order, the Municipality will share a draft of any RFP it intends \nto issue to solicit Consultant bids.  The United States may provide any comments or \nsuggestions it has on the RFP within three (3) weeks of receipt and the Municipality will \n2 \n \n\n \nwork in good faith to consider the United States’ input.  The RFP notice shall be issued in \nEnglish and Spanish.  Following the Municipality’s selection of a Consultant, but at least \none (1) month before the contract with the Consultant is executed, the Municipality will \nprovide the United States with information about the proposed Consultant’s credentials, \ntheir experience conducting comparable assessments, and the methodology and \ntechnological tools they have proposed to conduct the Assessment.  If the United States \nobjects to the Municipality’s proposed Consultant, the Parties will attempt to resolve the \ndisagreement in good faith pursuant to the dispute resolution process in Paragraph 18.  \nSan Juan will bear all costs and expenses of retaining the Consultant.   \n7.  Assessment Report:  The Assessment Consultant will produce a written Assessment \nReport that identifies all elements of the Public Sidewalk System that are within the \nMunicipality’s control and that are not in compliance with the ADA Accessibility \nStandards.  The Assessment will be limited to locations over which the Municipality has \nlegal authority and control.  The Assessment will, however, include identification of \naccessibility barriers in the Public Sidewalk System caused by other entities, including \nutility poles and electric company boxes.   \n8.  Remediation Priorities:  The Accessibility Consultant will also recommend an approach \nto completing the remediation that prioritizes: (a) providing access to Municipal and \nother government offices and facilities, transportation terminals, places of public \naccommodation, and employers, consistent with the priorities outlined in 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.150(d)(2); and (b) responding to requests or input provided by people with \ndisabilities through the Barrier Reporting Process and other means.  \n9.  Periodic Status Conferences:  Three (3) months after the retention of the Accessibility \nConsultant, and every three (3) months thereafter, the Court will hold virtual status \nconferences at which the Parties will be present along with a representative for the \nAccessibility Consultant.  At these conferences, the Municipality and the Consultant will \nprovide written updates on the status and progress of the Assessment and copies of the \ndata collected to date.  The Parties will make themselves available to meet and confer (in \nperson or remotely) more frequently as needed. \n10.  Completion:  The Municipality will complete the Assessment within thirty (30) months \nof the date of this Order and will provide a copy to the United States.  San Juan will also \npost a link in a conspicuous location on the Municipality’s homepage to a copy of the \nAssessment in an Accessible Format on the Municipality’s website.   \nD.  Ongoing Remediation and Future Construction or Alteration \n11.  The United States acknowledges that the Municipality has already allocated \n$3,100,000.00 for the repair and replacement of elements of the Public Sidewalk System.  \n12.  Following entry of this Order, the Municipality will ensure that whenever it constructs or \nalters elements of the Public Sidewalk System, any sidewalks, curb ramps, crosswalks or \nother pedestrian facilities affected by the construction or alteration will be made \ncompliant with the ADA Accessibility Standards (consistent with the elements identified \nin Attachment A).  The Municipality will also ensure that whenever it repaves or \n3 \n \n\n \nresurfaces roadways it complies with 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(i) by providing compliant curb \nramps or other sloped areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry \nfrom a street level pedestrian walkway.  The Municipality will have six (6) months \nfollowing entry of this Order to enter into any contracts necessary to ensure that any \nrepavement or resurfacing work in progress as of the date of this Order complies with this \nrequirement.  \nE.  Compliance Verification \n13.  Subject Matter Experts:  All new construction, alterations, or repairs made by San Juan to \nthe Public Sidewalk System following entry of this Order must be inspected and certified \nas compliant with the ADA Accessibility Standards by an independent licensed architect, \nengineer, or otherwise professionally licensed Subject Matter Expert (SME) who has \nexpertise on the ADA Accessibility Standards.  SMEs may not be Municipal employees \nbut may be outside contractors who are also retained by the Municipality to conduct \narchitectural inspections.  San Juan will provide the curriculum vitae or resume for any \nSME it retains to the United States, upon request.  San Juan will not retain an SME to \ncertify the compliance of a Public Sidewalk System element if the SME, or their business \nassociates, was in any way involved in the design or construction of that specific element. \nThe Municipality will have ninety (90) days from the entry of this Order to retain an \nSME to comply with this section if it has not done so previously.  \n14.  Certification:  SMEs will certify the compliance of Public Sidewalk System elements \nwith the ADA Accessibility Standards by creating “Certificates of Compliance,” \nsubstantially similar in form and content to the certification forms in Attachment A, that \nidentify the element(s) being certified with sufficient specificity to provide notice to third \nparties of ADA compliance and will be accompanied by sufficient, conclusive evidence \nsupporting the certification including, but not limited to photographs showing pertinent \nmeasurements (such as slope and dimensional characteristics).  This information should \nbe compiled in a way that can be provided easily in an electronic format. \n15.  Reporting and Technical Assistance:  San Juan will provide all Certificates of \nCompliance issued by SMEs to the United States upon request.  The United States may \nnotify San Juan if an SME submits Certificates that do not comply with the above \nrequirements. \nF.  ADA Coordinator, Notice, and Grievance Procedure \n16.  The Parties acknowledge that the Municipality has hired an ADA Coordinator.   Within \nthirty (30) days of the date of this Order, the Municipality will ensure that the ADA \nCoordinator’s contact information (name, office address, telephone number, and email \naddress) is posted in an Accessible Format in a conspicuous location on the \nMunicipality’s homepage. \n17.  The Parties acknowledge that the Municipality has issued a Notice Under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA Notice”) and has adopted an ADA Grievance Procedure. \nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this Order, the Municipality will post the ADA \nNotice and ADA Grievance Procedure in an Accessible Format on the Municipality’s \n4 \n \n\n \nwebsite with links to the documents in a conspicuous location on the homepage.   The \nMunicipality will distribute these documents to all of its agency heads, and will update, \nredistribute, and repost them whenever necessary to ensure their accuracy. \nG. Information Sharing and Collaboration \n18.  The Parties will cooperate in good faith to share information relevant to compliance with \nthis Order.  If any Party believes that another Party has failed to comply with any \nprovision of this Order, it will provide written notice to all Parties of the alleged \nnoncompliance.  The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the alleged \nnoncompliance.  If, after twenty-one (21) days, the Parties have been unable to resolve \nthe dispute, any Party may file a motion with the Court to enforce this Order or seek other \nappropriate relief, including lifting the stay.    \n19.  Any provisions and time limits for performance imposed by this Order, including \ndeadlines for work to be completed by the Municipality, may be extended only with the \nCourt’s approval.  All Parties will, reasonably, in good faith, and without undue delay, \nconsider requests by other Parties to jointly move to extend deadlines agreed upon in this \nStipulated Order.  No Party shall be deemed to be in violation of this Order when its \nfailure to comply or delay in complying with a provision of the Order is caused by a force \nmajeure—i.e., an event or effect that the Party can neither anticipate nor control.  If the \nParties disagree upon whether an extension or delay is appropriate or warranted, they will \nattempt to resolve the dispute pursuant to the process in the preceding paragraph.  \n20.  This Order will remain in effect for thirty-six (36) months.  At least six (6) months prior \nto expiration of this Order, the Parties will meet and confer and propose dates to \nMagistrate Judge Giselle López-Soler for a further mediation session.  At the mediation, \nthe Parties will engage in good faith negotiations aimed at conclusively resolving this \nmatter in light of the information gathered in the Assessment.   \n21.  Nothing in this order should be construed as an admission by the Municipality that the \nPublic Sidewalk System is a service, consistent with the meaning of such term, in the \nADA.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED this ___ day of ________  , 2023.  \n \n_______________________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGE \n \n \nSIGNATURES ON FOLLOWING PAGE.
