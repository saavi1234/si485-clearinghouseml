Gilbert: In response to telephone inquiries to chambers concerning the hearing on Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction 21 currently scheduled for 8/3/16 and the Court's preferred time allocations for oral argument at that hearing, the Court suggests the following allocations: Plaintiffs will take up to 30 minutes for an opening presentation; the Federal Defendants together, the District Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants will each take up to 20 minutes for any separate presentations; and Plaintiffs will take up to 20 minutes for any rebuttal. The Court does not need any party to regurgitate verbatim what they have said in their briefs. Rather, the Court encourages presentations that hit the high points, focus on or summarize the key facts or law upon which a party relies, and emphasize what a party believes to be the fundamental or key weakness(es) in an opponents position. The Court also will have some questions for the parties. If these proposed time allocations are not acceptable, then the parties should feel free to submit a letter to chambers with their alternative proposal(s). The Court continues to reserve the option to continue the 8/3/16 hearing as it mentioned at an earlier hearing if it believes that is necessary. Mailed notice (ber, ) (Entered: 07/26/2016)"

Counsel for Plaintiffs, Defendants and Proposed Intervenors 30 appeared. The Court sets the following briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction 21 : Defendants shall respond by 7/8/16. Plaintiffs shall reply by 7/22/16. Motion hearing set for 8/3/16 at 9:30 a.m. The District Defendants shall serve the written discovery they want to serve upon Plaintiffs by 6/3/16, with courtesy copies delivered to Judge Gilbert's chambers, Room 1366. Also by 6/3/16, Defendants shall file a 5-page memorandum stating why they believe their discovery is relevant and why it is important for the Court to see responses to that discovery before ruling on the Preliminary Injunction Motion. Plaintiffs' time to respond to written discovery, which the District Defendants characterize as focused interrogatories on the hostile environment issue, is shortened to fourteen (14) days or to 6/17/16. If Plaintiffs plan to file a motion for protective order (along with any supporting memorandum of law) directed to the District Defendants' discovery, they shall do so by 6/8/16 and notice that motion for initial hearing on 6/9/16. The Court's order concerning the District Defendants' interrogatories is without prejudice to any party's request for written or oral discovery in connection with Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and subject to the Court's determination that such discovery should proceed on whatever timetable might be set as appropriate under the circumstances.

For the reasons advanced by Intervenor-Defendants during this morning's hearing, the Court is satisfied that the requested discovery is sufficiently necessary for Intervenor-Defendants to respond fully to Plaintiffs' contention that Student A is a biological male and the basis for that contention. Intervenor-Defendants, therefore, are given leave to serve their two proposed requests for admission and one interrogatory. During the motion hearing, Plaintiffs said that they would not require significant time to respond to this discovery. Accordingly, Plaintiffs shall respond to the discovery by July 6, 2016, as suggested by Intervenor-Defendants, so as not to necessitate any change to the existing briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 21]. The Court will take under advisement Plaintiffs' request that they be allowed to serve four requests for admission of their own if Intervenor-Defendants are allowed to serve the written discovery discussed above. It is not clear to the Court that Plaintiffs' proposed discovery is necessary for them to present fully their arguments in support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction. In fact, Plaintiffs acknowledged at this morning's hearing that they would not have requested leave to serve their own requests for admission if Intervenor-Defendants had not sought leave to serve theirs. That may not be determinative at this juncture but it is instructive. The Court would like to evaluate whether Plaintiffs' proffered requests for admission are sufficiently necessary for them to address fully Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants' arguments after those parties file their responses to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. A status hearing in the nature of a Rule 16 conference is set for July 13, 2016 at 9:30 a.m. for the purpose of more fully discussing this issue as well as the issues to be decided in the context of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, and whether any party needs additional discovery to address the issues raised in that Motion and any responses thereto. Signed by the Honorable Jeffrey T. Gilbert on 6/30/2016. Mailed notice (ber, ) (Entered: 06/30/2016)"

          "description": "ORDER: Upon further reflection and after reviewing again Defendants' and Intervenor-Defendants' response briefs filed on 7/8/16, the Court has reconsidered its ruling entered earlier this week 86 denying Plaintiffs' Motion to Conduct Limited, Expedited Discovery of Intervenor-Defendants 81 . The Court now understands better why Plaintiffs want to serve the requests for admission attached to their Motion as Exhibit A [81-1] and concludes that the record on Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction 21 should include responses to those requests for admission. Although the Court continues to believe that Intervenor-Defendants objection to responding to Plaintiffs' requests for admission, grounded in Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden), has merit, the Court now is of the opinion that Plaintiffs reason for developing the record in support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction with these limited requests for admission outweighs Intervenor- Defendants' interest in not being required to respond to them. The Court, however, grants Plaintiffs Motion to Conduct Limited, Expedited Discovery of Intervenor-Defendants 81 only in part. The only Intervenor-Defendant that must answer the requests for admission is Student A by and through Student A's parent or legal guardian. Further, it appears unnecessary for Student A to respond to Plaintiffs' Interrogatory No. 1, Exhibit B to Plaintiffs Motion [81-2], at this time given the proviso in Rule 36(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that if a matter is not admitted, the answering party must state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. Accordingly, the Court trusts that Rule 36 provides a sufficient vehicle for Plaintiffs to develop the record on the matters set forth in their requests for admission. Accordingly, for these reasons, the Court, on its own motion, hereby vacates its Order entered on 7/13/16 86 and, instead, grants in part and denies in part Plaintiffs' Motion to Conduct Limited, Expedited Discovery of Intervenor Defendants 81 . Intervenor-Defendant Student A by and through Student As parent or legal guardian shall answer Plaintiffs requests for admission by 7/21/16. Plaintiffs' time to file their reply brief is extended to 7/26/16. Signed by the Honorable Jeffrey T. Gilbert on 7/15/2016. Mailed notice(ber, ) (Entered: 07/15/2016)"

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about whether cisgender students' privacy rights were violated by a public school district's policy of allowing transgender students to use the locker rooms and restrooms that align with their gender identities.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to this litigation, in 2013, a complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) alleging that Township High School District 211 was discriminating against a transgender student (Student A) on the basis of her sex by refusing use of the girls' locker rooms. The OCR conducted an investigation and determined that the school district's policy violated Title IX, 34 C.F.R. &sect; 106.31. On December 2, 2015, the school district entered into an agreement with OCR in which it promised to install and maintain private changing stations in its girls' locker rooms. Student A was granted access to the girls' locker rooms, and she promised to use the private changing stations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, 2016, a group called Students and Parents for Privacy and five students (and their parents) from Township High School District 211 filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking to enjoin the OCR agreement as well as a pre-existing school district policy allowing students to use restrooms in accordance with their gender identity. The group also challenged several guidance documents from the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) in which the term \"sex\" in Title IX was interpreted to include gender identity.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint claimed that the school district's gender identity-inclusive restroom and locker room policies violated Title IX and substantive due process rights under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, namely the cisgender students' right to bodily privacy and their parents' right to control their children's upbringing and education. The plaintiffs made free exercise claims under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb, and its Illinois counterpart, citing the students' religious freedom to practice modesty. They also claimed that the aforementioned DOE guidance documents violated the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by the Thomas More Society and the Alliance Defending Freedom, the group sued the DOE, the U.S. Secretary of Education, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney General, and the school district's directors. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief from the school district's locker and restroom policies and the challenged guidance documents.&nbsp; They also sought nominal damages of $1.00, compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Jorge L. Alonso and Magistrate Jeffrey T. Gilbert.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 25, 2016, a motion to intervene was filed by Student A, two additional transgender students, and the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance. Judge Alonso granted their motion, allowing them to join the litigation as defendants, on June 15, 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, which they filed on May 23, 2016, was assigned to Magistrate Gilbert two days later. Initially, the plaintiffs sought to fully enjoin enforcement of the federal rule that included gender identity as part of \"sex\" under Title IX. At oral argument, the plaintiffs narrowed the scope of the relief they sought to simply enjoin enforcement of the federal rule against District 211. On October 18, 2016, Magistrate Gilbert recommended that the court deny the motion. 2016 WL 6134121.</p>\r\n<p>On June 20, 2017, the plaintiffs notified the court that the federal defendants had not filed an answer or motion for summary judgment. The court dismissed those defendants without prejudice the same day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The district court complied with Magistrate Gilbert's recommendation and denied the motion for a preliminary injunction on December 29, 2017, holding that the plaintiffs had not met the threshold showings required for preliminary injunctive relief because they had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits nor a threat of irreparable harm. 2017 WL 6629520.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 15, 2018, an amended complaint was filed by a pared-down set of plaintiffs comprised of Students and Parents for Privacy and its president. Since the federal defendants had been dismissed, only the school district's leadership and the intervenor-defendants were included. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs used the term \"Compelled Affirmation Policy\" to describe District 211's gender-affirming policies regarding overnight accommodations on school trips, locker room access, and bathroom access. They brought the same constitutional and statutory arguments against this policy as they had in the original complaint.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants and intervenor defendants promptly moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On March 29, 2019, those motions were granted in part and denied in part. The president of Students and Parents for Privacy was dismissed for lack of standing. The court held that the plaintiffs had plausible claims under Title IX (sexual harassment), the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Free Exercise Clause. The parents' due process right to direct the education of their children, however, did not extend to a right to determine whether their children would share restrooms and locker rooms with transgender children. 377 F.Supp.3d 891.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Less than two weeks later, Students and Parents for Privacy notified the court that they would dismiss their remaining claims. The court dismissed the case without prejudice on April 15, 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed.&nbsp;</p>",

This  is  a  civil  rights  action  to  stop  the  Department  of  Education \n(“DOE”) and Township High School District 211 (“District 211” or “District”) from \ncontinuing  to  trample  students’  privacy  and  other  constitutional  and  statutory \nrights by forcing 14- to 17-year-old girls to use locker rooms and restrooms with \nbiological males; and to set aside DOE’s ultra vires legislative rule redefining “sex” \nin Title IX to include gender identity which, despite originating in a non-binding \nguidance document and being adopted without following the procedures mandated \nby the Administrative Procedure Act, is being enforced against schools across the \ncountry; and, to enjoin DOE’s enforcement of this rule against District 211 to the \ndetriment of Plaintiffs.  \n2. The DOE threatened District 211 with the loss of $6 million of federal \nfunding if it did not give a biologically male student (“Student A”), who perceives \nhimself1 to be female, the right of entry to, and use of, the girls’ locker rooms.  \n3. District 211 entered into an agreement with DOE that grants Student \nA the right to enter and use all girls’ locker rooms at District 211 schools.  OCR \nCase  No.  05-14-1055,  Agreement  to  Resolve,  December  2,  2015,  available  at \n1 Both Title IX and the legal precedent regarding bodily privacy recognize that \ndistinctions  based  on  biological  sex  are  necessary  to  protect  privacy.  Therefore, \nalthough  Plaintiffs  are  aware  that  Student  A  identifies  as  a  female,  it  is  his \nbiological status as a male, as both the November 2, 2015, Letter of Findings from \nthe DOE’s Office of Civil Rights and the Plaintiffs’ personal knowledge confirm, that \nis  relevant  to  determining  whether  Plaintiffs’  rights  have  been  violated  by \nDefendants’ actions.  Therefore, to reflect the biological facts that are necessary \nknowledge for this Court’s adjudication of Plaintiffs’ claims, Plaintiffs use masculine \npronouns throughout this Complaint.\n2 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 3 of 83 PageID #:3\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/township-high-211-agreement.pdf. \n(last visited May 3, 2016) (the “Locker Room Agreement”). \n4. Previously,  the  District  granted  Student  A,  and  all  other  students, \npermission  to  use  school  restrooms  according  to  the  students’  perceived  gender \nidentity. (the “Restroom Policy”). \n5. Because  of  the  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  the  Restroom  Policy, \nStudent A currently uses both the girls’ locker rooms and the girls’ restrooms at \nWilliam Fremd High School (“Fremd”).  \n6. This  creates  an  intimidating  and  hostile  environment  for  the  girl \nmembers of Students and Parents for Privacy, some of whom are as young as 14, \nbecause Student A—who is biologically a male—actively uses their private facilities \nat the same times as Plaintiffs. \n7. As a direct result of Defendants’ Policies and actions, every day these \ngirls  go  to  school,  they  experience  embarrassment,  humiliation,  anxiety,  fear, \napprehension, stress, degradation, and loss of dignity because they will have to use \nthe locker room and restroom with a biological male.  \n8. Because of Defendants’ Policies and actions, they are afraid of being \nseen by, and being forced to share intimate spaces with, a male while they are in \nvarious states of undress.  \n9. Because of Defendants’ Policies and actions, these girls are also afraid \nthey will have to see a male in a state of undress. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 4 of 83 PageID #:4\n10. Because  of  Defendants’  Policies  and  actions,  the  girls  are  afraid  of \nhaving to attend to their most personal needs, especially during a time when their \nbody is undergoing often embarrassing changes as they transition from childhood to \nadulthood, in a locker room or restroom with a male present.  \n11. The embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, \ndegradation,  and  loss  of  dignity  these  girls  experience  because  of  Defendants’ \nPolicies and actions are heightened because as adolescents they are at a time in \ntheir lives when they are the most shy, embarrassed, and aware of their bodies and \nthe differences between their bodies and the bodies of their male classmates.  \n12. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  Restroom  Policy  have  had  and \ncontinue to have a profoundly negative effect on the girls’ access to educational \nopportunities, benefits, programs, and activities at their schools: \na. some girls actively avoid the locker rooms at school;  \nb. one girl has started wearing her gym clothes underneath her \nregular clothes all day, so she only has to peel off a layer instead \nof exposing her unclothed body in the presence of a biological \nmale in the locker room;  \nc. other  girls  are  changing  as  quickly  as  possible  in  the  locker \nroom, avoiding all eye contact and conversation, all the while \nexperiencing great stress and anxiety over whether a biological \nmale will walk in while they are unclothed;  \n4 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 5 of 83 PageID #:5\nd. some girls are avoiding the restroom altogether, and others are \nwaiting as long as possible to use the restroom, so they won’t \nhave  to  share  it  with  a  biological  male,  thus  risking  certain \nhealth problems; and \ne. still other girls are risking tardiness by running to the opposite \nend of the school, during short 5 minute passing periods, to try \nto find an empty restroom.  \n13. These negative effects on the girls’ access to educational opportunities, \nbenefits,  programs,  and  activities  at  their  school  are  a  direct  result  of  DOE’s \nadoption and enforcement of the legislative rule redefining the term “sex” in Title \nIX to include gender identity, the Locker Room Agreement following from that rule, \nand District 211’s Restroom Policy. \n14. The DOE’s action violates the Administrative Procedure Act; and, the \nLocker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy violate the Plaintiffs’ right to privacy, \ndiscriminate on the basis of sex under Title IX by creating a hostile environment, \nand  violate  additional  constitutional  and  statutory  rights  of  Plaintiffs.    They \ntherefore seek redress from this Court.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE   \n15.  This action arises under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 et seq. (the “Civil Rights \nAct”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500 et seq.

Defendant  District  211  is  responsible  for  the  enforcement  of  its \npolicies by its Superintendent, administrators, teachers, and all its other employees. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nThe DOE Mandates An Unlawful Policy \nTitle IX and its meaning \n47. Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance…” 20 U.S.C. § 1681. \n48. The regulations implementing Title IX provide, in relevant part, that \n“no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  academic, \nextracurricular…or  other  education  program  or  activity  operated  by  a  recipient \nwhich receives Federal financial assistance.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a). \n49. The implementing regulations also provide that a funding recipient \nshall  not,  on  the  basis  of  sex:  “Treat  one  person  differently  from  another  in \ndetermining whether such person satisfies any requirement or condition for the \nprovision  of  such  aid,  benefit,  or  service;  …  Provide  different  aid,  benefits,  or \nservices or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different manner; … Deny any \nperson  any  such  aid,  benefit,  or  service;  …  Subject  any  person  to  separate  or \ndifferent rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment; …[or] Otherwise limit any \n11 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 12 of 83 PageID #:12\nperson  in  the  enjoyment  of  any  right,  privilege,  advantage,  or  opportunity.”  34 \nC.F.R. § 106.31(b). \n50. Nothing  in  Title  IX’s  text,  structure,  legislative  history,  or \naccompanying regulations addresses gender identity.  \n51. The term “gender identity” does not appear in the text of Title IX. \n52. The  term  “gender  identity”  does  not  appear  in  the  regulations \naccompanying Title IX.  \n53. Indeed,  recognizing  that  Title  IX  does  not  protect  against \ndiscrimination because of “gender identity” (but only against discrimination because \nof biological sex), beginning in 2011, Senator Al Franken has repeatedly introduced \nlegislation  modeled  after  Title  IX  that  would  protect  against  gender  identity \ndiscrimination in the education context. \n54. That legislation has failed to pass every year it has been introduced. \n55. Title IX, and the accompanying regulations, use the term “sex,” not \n“gender identity,” in describing the type of discrimination prohibited.  \n56. The term “sex” as used in Title IX and its implementing regulations \nmeans male and female, under the traditional binary conception of sex consistent \nwith one’s birth or biological sex.  \n57. Title IX also states that “nothing contained herein shall be construed \nto  prohibit  any  educational  institution  receiving  funds  under  this  Act,  from \nmaintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes[,]” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, \nindicating  that  Congress  intended  that  Title  IX  should  respect  student  privacy \n12 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 13 of 83 PageID #:13\nrights, and not violate them by compelling introduction of opposite-sex students into \nprivate areas designated for one biological sex. \n58. Title IX’s  accompanying regulations confirm that schools “may provide \nseparate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, [as long as] \nsuch facilities provided for students of one sex [are] comparable to such facilities \nprovided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.   \n59. Preventing  the  mixing  of  biological  boys  and  girls  in  intimate \nenvironments like restrooms, locker rooms, and showers is the very reason Congress \nallowed for separate living facilities, and that Title IX regulations allow for separate \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas, for the different sexes. \nDOE acts without legal authority by adopting and enforcing a legislative rule \nredefining “sex” in Title IX to include gender identity \n \n60. Under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  any  “rules  which  do  not \nmerely  interpret  existing  law  or  announce  tentative  policy  positions  but  which \nestablish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must comply with \nthe APA’s notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how they initially are \nlabeled.” 72 Fed. Reg. 3433. \n61. Regulations  enacted  under  Title  IX  must  also  be  “approved  by  the \nPresident” before they become effective. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n62. The  DOE  has  declared  that  the  term  “sex”  as  used  in  Title  IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination now means, or at least includes, “gender identity.”  \n63. The  DOE  announced  this  new  legislative  rule  redefining  “sex”  to \nschools nationwide in several DOE guidance documents published over the last few \n13 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 14 of 83 PageID #:14\nyears,  including  the  following:    U.S.  Department  of  Education,  Office  for  Civil \nRights, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence, 5 (Apr. 2014); U.S. \nDepartment of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Questions and Answers on Title IX \nand Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular Activities, \n25  (Dec.  2014);  U.S.  Department  of  Education,  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  Title  IX \nResource Guide, 1, 15, 16, 19, 21-22 (Apr. 2015).  \n64. DOE’s new rule requires schools to treat students consistently with \ntheir perceived gender identity, regardless of biological sex.  \n65. OCR issued a Letter of Findings against District 211 in November \n2015 that informed the District that when OCR investigates Title IX complaints, it \nlooks  for  evidence  of  “discrimination  based  on  sex,  gender  identity,  or  gender \nnonconformity.”  OCR Case No. 05-14-1055, Letter of Findings, November 2, 2015, \navailable  at  http://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/township-high-211-\nletter.pdf (last visited May 3, 2016). \n66. OCR then informed District 211 that it discriminated on the basis of \ngender identity, in violation of Title IX, by refusing a biological male, who perceives \nhimself to be female, access to the girls’ locker and shower rooms.  \n67. DOE  threatened  District  211  with  the  loss  of  $6  million  dollars  in \nfederal funds if it failed to grant a biologically male student access to the girls’ \nlocker and shower rooms. \n14 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 15 of 83 PageID #:15\n68. DOE  is  treating  its  declaration  that  Title  IX  bars  gender  identity \ndiscrimination as a legislative rule that is binding on all schools that are subject to \nTitle IX. \n69. The DOE is actively enforcing its legislative rule that Title IX includes \ngender identity against schools across the country, not just District 211. \n70. DOE  did  not  comply  with  APA’s  notice-and-comment  requirements \nwhen it adopted its legislative rule redefining “sex” in Title IX to include gender \nidentity and mandating that schools give students seeking access to opposite sex \nfacilities based on their gender identity the access they desire. \n District 211’s Locker Room Agreement  \n71. Student A is currently an 11th grade student at Fremd High School. \n72. He was born a boy and is anatomically male. \n73. Throughout  most  of  his  school  career,  Student  A  identified  to  his \nclassmates, including Student Plaintiffs, as a boy, consistent with his biological sex.  \n74. He used the restrooms and locker rooms consistent with his biological \nsex prior to high school.  \n75. At  some  point  during  middle  school,  Student  A  decided  to  publicly \nidentify himself as female. \n76. When he entered high school, although he had been using the boys’ \nfacilities in middle school, Student A and his parents requested that he be allowed \nto use the girls’ locker rooms.  \n77. District 211 initially refused. \n15 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 16 of 83 PageID #:16\n78. The District told Student A that he could not use girls’ locker rooms \nbecause his presence would invade the privacy of female students.     \n79. From approximately the summer of 2013 to January 14, 2016, District \n211 refused to give Student A access to the girls’ locker rooms.  \n80. In December 2013, Student A (or his representatives) filed a complaint \nwith OCR, alleging that District 211 violated his rights under Title IX, when it \ndenied him use of the girls’ locker rooms.   \n81. OCR commenced an investigation of District 211’s locker and shower \nroom policies as applied to Student A.   \n82. District 211 defended its policy.   \n83. District 211 told OCR that it “based its decision” not to allow Student \nA to use the girls’ locker and shower rooms “on the needs of all students,” explaining \nthat it came to this decision after “balancing Student A’s rights and interests with \nthe privacy concerns of . . . female students.”  \n84. Student A asked to use a private stall to change, but District 211 said \nthat would not be practicable in part because there are too few stalls and too many \nstudents.  \n85. When  word  of  OCR’s  investigation  became  public,  District  211 \ninformed parents in a public newsletter that the District’s goal was “to protect the \nprivacy rights of all students when changing clothes or showering before or after \nphysical education and after-school activities.”  \n16 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 17 of 83 PageID #:17\n86. Superintendent  Cates  stated  that  the  District  would  continue  to \nprovide  “individual  accommodations”  to  students  seeking  access  to  opposite  sex \nfacilities based on their gender identity “in a manner that does not infringe on the \nprivacy concerns of other students.”  \n87. District  211  provided  Student  A  with  several  private  facilities  to \nchange his clothes for physical education and athletics from the fall of 2013 through \nJanuary 14, 2016. \n88. Student A expressed dissatisfaction with the private arrangements.  \n89. In response to Student A’s complaints, District 211 provided different \noptions and installed lockers, mirrors, and other equipment in the private rooms for \nStudent A’s use.  \n90. When Student A complained about changing alone, District 211 offered \nto put lockers in the restroom adjoining the PE locker room so Student A could \ninvite his friends to change with him.  \n91. Student  A  spoke  with  several  friends  but  no  girls  would  agree  to \nchange with him. \n92. Despite  District  211’s  policy  prohibiting  any  biological  males  from \nentering the female locker rooms, Student A entered girls’ locker rooms on at least \nsix occasions. \n93. He entered the girls’ PE locker room during his PE class. \n94. He entered the girls’ swim locker room during the swim unit in PE, \nwhile girls were present and using the swim locker room. \n17 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 18 of 83 PageID #:18\n95. He entered the girls’ gymnastics’ locker room on at least four occasions, \nwhile he was on the girls’ gymnastics team and while girls were present and using \nthe locker room. \n96. At least once, Student A undressed and changed his clothes in the \ngirls’ gymnastics locker room while girls were present. \n97. Four  girls  and  one  parent  contacted  the  coach  and  expressed  how \nembarrassed, anxious, uncomfortable, and distressed the girls felt using a locker \nroom and being forced to change with a biological male. \n98. District 211 responded by again instructing Student A to use one of the \nprivate facilities designated for his use.   \n99. In  July  2015,  OCR  informed  District  211  that  its  investigation  of \nStudent A’s complaint was complete and that he was entitled to use the girls’ locker \nrooms pursuant to Title IX.   \n100. On  October  12,  2015,  District  211  informed  OCR  it  would  not \nvoluntarily resolve the alleged Title IX violation, but would continue to provide \nStudent A an accommodation so he would not have to use the boys’ locker rooms if \nhe did not want to do so. \n101. The District again cited concerns for the girls’ privacy.  \n102. Despite the District’s privacy concerns, on November 2, 2015, OCR \nissued a Letter of Findings against District 211 stating that it had violated Title IX \nby not granting Student A access to the girls’ locker rooms.   \n18 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 19 of 83 PageID #:19\n103. The letter also stated that District 211 had “30 calendar days [from] \nthe date of this Letter of Findings” to give Student A access to the locker rooms, or \nOCR would “issu[e] a Letter of Impending Enforcement Action.”   \n104. DOE’s  announcement  of  its  intent  to  issue  a  Letter  of  Impending \nEnforcement Action was a threat to begin proceedings to remove millions of dollars \nin federal funding if the District did not give Student A right of entry to and use of \nthe girls’ locker rooms and shower rooms. \n105. On December 2, 2015, despite public outcry from Plaintiffs and many \nother parents and students, District 211 signed an agreement with OCR by which \nthe District agreed, among other things, to give Student A right of entry to and use \nof any and all of the girls’ locker rooms and shower rooms in Fremd High School and \nall of the girls’ locker rooms and shower rooms throughout the District when he \nvisits other schools. (The “Locker Room Agreement”). \n106. The  Agreement  states  that  Student  A  represented  that  he  would \nchange  in  private  changing  stations  in  the  locker  rooms,  but  nothing  in  the \nagreement requires him to do so. \n107. There is also no penalty under the Agreement if Student A decides not \nto change in the private stalls. \n108. The Locker Room Agreement took effect on January 15, 2016. \n109. The Locker Room Agreement is an official policy of District 211. \n \n \n19 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 20 of 83 PageID #:20\nThe Damaging Effects of the Locker Room Agreement on Girls  \n110. Because of the Locker Room Agreement, Student A is currently using \nthe girls’ locker rooms while female students are present, including some of the Girl \nPlaintiffs.   \n111. He has right of entry to and use of all three girls’ locker rooms: the \nlocker room near the main gymnasium, used for physical education (“PE locker \nroom”);  the  locker  room  used  for  particular  athletic  sports,  including  girls’ \ngymnastics (“gymnastics locker room”); and the locker room near the pool, used for \nswimming activities (“swim locker room”). \n112. There are Girl Plaintiffs who use each of the three locker rooms to \nchange their clothes.  \n113. There are Girl Plaintiffs who regularly use the showers in the swim \nlocker room. \n114. Girl Plaintiffs live in constant anxiety, fear, and apprehension that a \nbiological boy will walk in at any time while they use the locker rooms and showers \nand see them in a state of undress or naked.  \n115. This  anxiety,  fear,  and  apprehension  stays  with  the  Girl  Plaintiffs \nthroughout the day as they anticipate having to use the locker rooms again. \nThe Damaging Effect on Girls: the PE Locker Room \n116. Girl Plaintiffs cannot escape forced interactions with Student A in the \nlocker rooms because physical education (“PE”) is a mandatory, daily course, all four \nyears of school in District 211, and is a requirement to graduate.  \n20 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 21 of 83 PageID #:21\n117. The PE locker room is a long rectangular room with several banks of \nlockers and a long row of lockers along the periphery wall. \n118. There are approximately 130 students in physical education classes \nduring a given class period. \n119. At a minimum, 65 girls must change their clothing in the locker rooms \nat one time.  \n120. It is mandatory that girls in PE class change into clothing appropriate \nfor PE class. \n121. Some Girl Plaintiffs also change into sports bras, resulting in even \ngreater bodily exposure while in the locker rooms. \n122. Currently, three of the Girl Plaintiffs have physical education during \nthe same class period as Student A, and so must use the PE locker room with him.   \n123. These Girl Plaintiffs object to being forced to use a locker room with \nany male. \n124. All three Girl Plaintiffs are afraid of, and embarrassed and humiliated \nby, changing their clothing in the same locker room as Student A, because he is a \nbiological male.  \n125. The dread, anxiety, stress, and fear these three Girl Plaintiffs feel over \nhaving to use the same PE locker room as a biological male is an ever-present \ndistraction throughout the school day, including during class instruction time. \n21 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 22 of 83 PageID #:22\n126. All Girl Plaintiffs, including the three who currently must share the \nLocker Room with Student A, are afraid and embarrassed to be seen in a state of \nundress by him, because he is a biological male. \n127. These three girls, and all Girl Plaintiffs, are also afraid to see Student \nA in a state of undress because he is a biological male, and are embarrassed and \nanxious worrying that they might see him in such a state. \n128. So,  all  three  Girl  Plaintiffs  in  Student  A’s  PE  period  change  their \nclothing as quickly as possible, while trying not to look at anyone. \n129. Because of the Defendants’ actions, all three experience humiliation, \nembarrassment, stress, anxiety, and fear while changing. \n130. Because of the Defendants’ actions that allow a male into the girls’ \nlocker  room,  all  three  have  come  to  view  the  PE  locker  room  as  a  scary  and \nintimidating environment. \n131. One  of  these  Girl  Plaintiffs  has  started  wearing  her  gym  clothes \nunderneath her regular clothes all day at school so she can avoid undressing in the \nlocker room. \n132. When it is time for physical education, she goes to the locker room, \nremoves her outer layer as fast as possible while looking at her feet, and then leaves \nas quickly as possible.  \n133. She then repeats this process after class, putting the layer back on and \nleaving as quickly as possible, wearing her dirty gym clothes underneath her street \nclothes for the rest of the day. \n22 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 23 of 83 PageID #:23\n134. Even  with  this  method  of  changing,  the  Defendants’  actions  have \nresulted  in  this  Girl  Plaintiff  being  forced  to  have  direct  interactions  with  a \nbiological  male  in  the  PE  locker  room,  which  makes  her  very  scared  and \nuncomfortable. \n135. On one recent occasion, Student A stood next to her while she was \nusing the mirror and repeatedly lifted his shirt, presumably to look at his body in \nthe mirror.  \n136. Girl Plaintiffs who are not in Student A’s gym period are also afraid, \nanxious,  stressed,  and  apprehensive  when  they  use  the  locker  rooms  because, \npursuant to the Defendants’ actions, a biological male has permission to enter and \nuse any of the girls’ locker rooms at any time of the school day.  \n137. Therefore, because of Defendants’ actions, Girl Plaintiffs know that a \nbiological male could walk in on them when they are undressing for PE. \nThe Damaging Effect on Girls: The Privacy Stalls Do Nothing to Stop the Harm \n138. District  211  constructed  five  stalls  in  the  PE  locker  room  where \nstudents could change their clothes.  \n139. These five stalls do nothing to address the Girl Plaintiffs’ fears about \nsharing a locker room with a biological male for numerous reasons. \n140. First, students who use the stalls are ridiculed and harassed by other \nstudents to such an extent that the stalls are not a practical option. \n141. Because students know that their use of the stalls will subject them to \nridicule and harassment, they generally do not use the stalls to change for PE class. \n23 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 24 of 83 PageID #:24\n142. A Girl Plaintiff in Student A’s PE period used one of the changing \nstalls on a single occasion because she is uncomfortable changing in the same locker \nroom with a biological boy. \n143. While she was in the changing stall, other girls who were in the locker \nroom began calling her names, including “transphobic” and “homophobic.”  \n144. Word spread that she had used the stall to change during PE class and \nshe began being harassed by other students in the hallways.  \n145. Both boys and girls called her names, yelled derogatory, slang words \nfor female body parts at her, and accused her of being transphobic and homophobic.   \n146. As a result of the ridicule and harassment this Girl Plaintiff received \nover her use of the stalls, she has not used them again.  \n147. This Girl Plaintiff is the student described above who now wears two \nsets of clothes to school so as to avoid having to undress at all in the locker room.   \n148. Second,  District  211  has,  through  various  announcements  to  the \nstudents at Fremd, and also through community meetings on gender identity that \nthe District has organized and sponsored, conveyed to the Student Plaintiffs the \nmessage that any objection to the Locker Room Agreement (or the Restroom Policy) \nwill be viewed by District administration as intolerance and bigotry.    \n149. For example, District 211 has organized and sponsored “community \neducation meetings” for each of its schools. \n150. The District represents the speakers at these meetings as experts on \ngender identity issues. \n24 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 25 of 83 PageID #:25\n151. These  speakers  have  exclusively  supported  the  Locker  Room \nAgreement and Restroom Policy and condemned any objection to these policies. \n152. The message the District conveys to parents and students in these \ncommunity education meetings is that any restriction on Student A’s use of opposite \nsex facilities is discrimination and that any objection to sharing a restroom or locker \nroom with a person seeking access to the opposite sex’s facilities based on gender \nidentity is born of bigotry, ignorance, and a lack of education. \n153. Because  of  the  District’s  message  that  differing  views  will  not  be \ntolerated, most of the Student Plaintiffs have not asked for a separate, private \nlocker room or restroom. \n154. Because of the District’s message, the Student Plaintiffs are afraid to \nbe named publicly in this lawsuit, for fear that other students and their schools will \nretaliate against them.  \n155. Third, even if the Girl Plaintiffs could use the stalls without suffering \nridicule and harassment, they do not remedy the privacy violation caused by the \npresence of a biological male sharing the same small, intimate settings where Girl \nPlaintiffs are naked or in other various states of undress. \n156. The five stalls in the PE locker room also do nothing to address the \nGirl Plaintiffs’ fears about being seen in a state of undress by a biological male. \n157. The stalls are located in the middle of the locker room such that, if \nStudent A chooses to use the stalls, he must walk past girls who are in a state of \nundress to go to and from the stalls.  \n25 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 26 of 83 PageID #:26\n158. The stalls do not fully shield the Girl Plaintiffs from being seen in a \nstate of undress because there are large gaps above and below the stall doors, and \ngaps  along  the  sides  of  the  door  that  another  student  could  see  through  even \ninadvertently. \n159. Nor do the stalls guarantee that Girl Plaintiffs will not see Student A \nin a state of undress if he chooses not to use the stalls for undressing and changing. \n160. While Student A said he planned to use the stalls when the Agreement \nwas signed, nothing in the Agreement prevents him from deciding later that he does \nnot want to use the stalls.  \n161. Also, there are no changing stalls in the gymnastics and swimming \nlocker rooms, which the Agreement gives Student A permission to use. \n162.  Fourth, even if Student A uses the privacy stalls, this is still not a \nsatisfactory option and does not guarantee that he will not see the Girl Plaintiffs in \na state of undress.  \n163. Because the stalls are located in the middle of the locker room, Student \nA must walk through the locker room to reach them. \n164. There is no requirement that Student A enter a privacy stall before the \ngirl students begin changing their clothes. \n165. There is also no requirement that Student A remain in a privacy stall \nuntil the girl students have finished changing their clothes. \n26 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 27 of 83 PageID #:27\n166. Under the terms of the Locker Room Agreement, Student A may enter \nthe  locker  rooms  at  any  time,  including  after  the  girl  students  begin  changing \nclothes. \n167. And, since the Locker Room Agreement does not require Student A to \nuse a privacy stall, if he chooses to use one he may exit it any time he likes, \nincluding while the girl students are in various stages of undress or fully unclothed.  \n168. Thus, even if Student A uses a privacy stall, the Girl Plaintiffs are still \nat risk of being seen in stages of undress, or fully unclothed, by a biological male.  \n169. Every Girl Plaintiff uses the PE locker room with the fear that a male \nwill see her in state of undress or that she will see a male in a state of undress.  \n170. The stress and anxiety the three Girl Plaintiffs feel over having to use \nthe locker room with Student A is an ever-present distraction throughout the school \nday, including during class instruction time. \nThe Damaging Effect on Girls: Girls in Gymnastics and Other Athletics  \n171.  The girls’ gymnastics locker room is a separate room, where girls, \nincluding at least one Girl Plaintiff, change into leotards for gymnastics.  \n172. The girls’ gymnastics locker room is small and open, with a few banks \nof lockers and an open shower area with two poles with showerheads attached.  \n173. In the girls’ gymnastics locker room, girls must change in the open \nroom, fully in view of each other. \n174. There are no private changing stalls in the girls’ gymnastics locker \nroom.  \n27 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 28 of 83 PageID #:28\n175. Girl Plaintiffs (and any other girls) who take part in gymnastics must \nremove all of their clothing to change into leotards.   \n176. Student A has taken part in girls’ gymnastics in the past.  \n177. The team is “no cut” so any student who wants to participate can join \nthe team.  \n178. One Girl Plaintiff was on the girl’s gymnastics team in 2015-16 and \nplans to be on the team again in 2016-17. \n179. Student A was on the girls’ gymnastics team in 2013-14 and 2015-16. \n180. On  information  and  belief,  Student  A  intends  to  participate  in \ngymnastics in 2016-17.  \n181. In 2013-14, Student A was not allowed in the locker room because the \nLocker Room Agreement had not yet been adopted.  \n182. The  school  gave  Student  A  a  separate,  private  place  to  change  for \ngymnastics because he is biologically male. \n183. In  2015-16,  Student  A  left  the  team  before  the  Locker  Room \nAgreement took effect in January.  \n184. The Locker Room Agreement permits Student A to change with the \nother gymnasts in the girls’ locker room.  \n185. The Girl Plaintiff, with her friends on the gymnastics team, do not \nwant to change into leotards in front of a biological male.   \n186. They are anxious and afraid that they will have to expose their fully \nunclothed bodies in front of a biological boy. \n28 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 29 of 83 PageID #:29\n187. They are also anxious and afraid that Student A will fully expose his \nunclothed body to change into his leotard in front of them.  \n188. Absent an injunction from this Court, a male student will be allowed to \nuse the gymnastics locker room to change his clothing and these girls’ fears will be \nrealized. \n189. In addition to gymnastics, Girl Plaintiffs participate in a number of \nextracurricular  athletics,  including  cheerleading,  track  and  field,  cross  country, \nwater polo, swimming, lacrosse, volleyball, badminton, and soccer.  \n190. Each of these activities requires students to change their clothing in \nthe girls’ locker rooms that, because of Defendants’ actions, are open to a male \nstudent’s use.  \n191. This makes all of the Girl Plaintiffs who participate in extracurricular \nathletics apprehensive and fearful. \nThe Damaging Effect on Girls: Swimming Activities \n192. Swimming  is  a  required  part  of  PE  for  freshman  and  sophomore \nstudents.  \n193. There  are  also  elective  swim  classes  available  to  junior  and  senior \nstudents, like Student A.  \n194. The  Girl  Plaintiffs  who  are  freshman  or  sophomores  and  who  are \nenrolled in mandatory swim class must use the swimming locker room.  \n29 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 30 of 83 PageID #:30\n195. The Girl Plaintiffs who are eighth graders will also be required to use \nthe swimming locker rooms for their mandatory swim class during their Freshman \nyear. \n196. The girls’ swim locker room contains an open area with lockers in the \nmiddle and mirrors, shelves, dryers, and benches along the outside. \n197. There are no private changing stalls in the girls’ swim locker room.  \n198. Girl Plaintiffs who take swimming class or participate in water-related \nathletics must change into and out of their swimsuits in this open area where they \nare visible to anyone in the locker room. \n199. Many girls shower. \n200. In order to rinse off the chlorine from the pool, girls regularly pull the \ntop half of their bathing suits down to their waist when they shower.  \n201. This is done in open showers visible to other students in the locker \nroom. \n202. Students do not have enough time to use the bathroom stalls to change \ninto and out of their swimsuits before and after PE.  \n203. Girl Plaintiffs in swimming activities must be fully unclothed at some \npoint in the locker room. \n204. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  allows  Student  A  to  access  the  girl’s \nswim  locker  room  at  anytime,  including  when  girls  are  present,  regardless  of \nwhether he is taking a swimming class or involved in a swimming sport. \n30 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 31 of 83 PageID #:31\n205. Because  of  Defendants’  actions,  Girl  Plaintiffs  experience  anxiety, \nstress, fear and apprehension when they have to use the swim locker room and \nthroughout their day, knowing they will have to use the swim locker room again. \nThe Damaging Effect on Girls: 8th Grade Girls \n206. Some of the Girl Plaintiffs are eighth graders who will attend Fremd \nnext year and who face the likelihood, like the other Girl Plaintiffs, that they may \nbe assigned to Student A’s physical education period and so may have to use the PE \nlocker room while he is present.   \n207. Specifically,  Plaintiff  A.V.  is  an  eighth  grade  girl  who  will  attend \nFremd next year.   \n208. A.V.  is  fearful,  uncomfortable,  and  apprehensive  about  using \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and showers with a biological male. \n209. A.V., along with several of her friends, told her mother, A.T.V., that \nthey are “petrified” of changing or taking care of private matters, including feminine \nhygiene needs, in restrooms or locker rooms with a biological male. \n210. These  eighth  graders  are  already  experiencing  stress,  fear  and \napprehension because of both the Locker Room Agreement and the Restroom Policy, \nbecause they know that next year their privacy will be invaded and their dignity \nwill be violated as a direct result of Defendants’ actions. \nThe Restroom Policy \n211. Prior  to  the  summer  of  2013,  all  of  the  schools  in  District  211 \nseparated their restrooms by biological sex.   \n31 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 32 of 83 PageID #:32\n212. Only biological females were allowed to use the restrooms designated \nfor girls, and only biological males were allowed to use the restrooms designated for \nboys.  \n213. This policy protected the privacy and safety of all children. \n214. This policy was changed sometime in summer 2013. \n215. When Student A started high school and he and his parents requested \naccess to the girls’ locker rooms, they also requested access to the girls’ restrooms.   \n216. District 211 agreed to give him the same access to the girls’ restrooms \nas is enjoyed by biological girls.  \n217.  District  211  then  extended  this  new  policy  to  all  students  and  all \nschools in the District, so that every District 211 student may use the restroom that \nis consistent with his or her perceived gender identity, irrespective of his or her \nbiological and anatomical sex (“Restroom Policy”).   \nThe Damaging Effects of the Restroom Policy \n218. District 211 did not notify parents or students of the new Restroom \nPolicy. \n219. Some Girl Plaintiffs found out about the new policy when they walked \ninto their restroom and came face-to-face with Student A.   \n220. They were startled, shocked, embarrassed, and afraid by the sight of a \nbiological male in the girls’ bathroom.  \n221. Currently, there are biological males who perceive themselves to be \nfemale at a number of schools in District 211. \n32 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 33 of 83 PageID #:33\n222. There are also biological females who perceive themselves to be male \nat a number of schools in District 211.  \n223. There is at least one student attending a District 211 school who self-\nidentifies as “gender fluid.”2  \n224. Because  of  the  Restroom  Policy  these  students  who  identify  as \ntransgender or gender fluid are permitted to use restrooms with students of the \nopposite sex.  \n225. That  means  all  Student  Plaintiffs  must  use  the  restroom  with  the \nknowledge that a student of the opposite biological sex could walk in on them at any \ntime.  \n226. This  causes  Student  Plaintiffs  to  experience  embarrassment, \nhumiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss \nof dignity. \n227. Using the toilets in the stalls does not resolve the embarrassment, \nhumiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, and stress produced by using \nthe restroom with students of the opposite sex, because the stalls are not fully \nprivate; and, besides, the Student Plaintiffs are still attending to private bodily \nneeds in the immediate presence of the opposite sex. \n2  “Gender  fluidity”  is  generally  defined  to  mean  that  one’s  gender  identity  can \nchange day-to-day, or even moment-to-moment, and is not limited to the two binary \ngenders (i.e., to “male” or “female”).  So, for example, one may identify as female one \nmoment, as male the next, and as neutrois (a neutral gender that is neither male \nnor female) the next.  See, e.g., Gender Diversity, “Gender Fluidity,” available at \nhttp://www.genderdiversity.org/resources/terminology/;  Nonbinary.org, \n“Genderfluid,” available at http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Genderfluid (both websites last \nvisited May 3, 2016).  \n33 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 34 of 83 PageID #:34\n228. In both the boys’ and girls’ restrooms, there are large gaps above and \nbelow the stall doors, and gaps along the sides of the door, that another student \ncould see through even inadvertently. \n229.   These gaps mean that the Student Plaintiffs, both boys and girls, \nmust risk exposing themselves to the opposite sex every time they use the restroom. \n230. District  211  cannot  guarantee  that  Student  Plaintiffs’  partially \nunclothed bodies will not be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex while \nusing the restroom. \n231. Girl  Plaintiffs  frequently  run  into  Student  A  when  they  use  the \nschools’ restrooms.  \n232. One  Girl  Plaintiff  saw  Student  A  four  times  in  one  week  in  the \nrestrooms.  \n233. Other Girl Plaintiffs have experienced Student A staring at them in \nthe restroom, which makes them uncomfortable. \n234. One Girl Plaintiff has experienced Student A walking into a restroom \nwhile she was washing her hands and staring at her in a way that made her feel \nvery awkward and uncomfortable.  \n235. As a consequence, some Girl Plaintiffs are using the restroom as little \nas possible while at school so they will not have to risk using the restroom with a \nmale student present.  This may increase their risk for various health conditions, \nlike bladder infections.  \n34 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 35 of 83 PageID #:35\n236. Some girls risk tardiness by running to the opposite end of the school, \nduring short 5 minute passing periods, to try to find a restroom not likely to be used \nby a male student.   \n237. The stress and anxiety some Girl Plaintiffs feel over having to use the \nrestroom with biological males is an ever-present distraction throughout the school \nday, including during class instruction time. \nThe Policies’ Additional Harms \n238. Each  Parent  Plaintiff  who  has  a  daughter  or  daughters  adamantly \nobjects to their daughters using locker rooms and shower rooms with a biological \nmale. \n239. All of the Parent Plaintiffs also adamantly object to their sons and \ndaughters using restrooms with students of the opposite sex. \n240. These Parent Plaintiffs do not want their children exposed to a student \nof the opposite biological sex while that student is in a state of undress. \n241. These  Parent  Plaintiffs  do  not  want  their  children’s  bodies  to  be \nexposed to a student of the opposite biological sex while naked or otherwise in a \nstate of undress, nor do they want their children to attend to their private bodily \nneeds in the presence of the opposite biological sex. \n242. Some  Parents  have  asked  the  District  for  private  options  for  their \ndaughters to change their clothes and use the restroom. \n243. The  options  offered  are  inadequate  and  inferior  to  the  facilities \nprovided to boys in the school. \n35 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 36 of 83 PageID #:36\n244. The options offered are inadequate and inferior to the girls’ facilities \nnow open to Student A. \n245. Additionally, the options offered are also unworkable in terms of the \npractical locker room needs of the Girl Plaintiffs. \n246. In response to the request for a private locker room facility, the Fremd \nPrincipal told Parent Plaintiffs that their daughters could use the stalls in the PE \nlocker room, the swimming or athletic locker rooms, or the nurses’ office. \n247. None of these are acceptable alternatives.  \n248. The  stalls  in  the  PE  locker  room  are  no  alternative  at  all  for  the \nreasons described above.  See supra at ¶¶ 138-170. \n249. The  swimming  and  athletic  locker  rooms  also  are  not  alternatives \nbecause  Student  A  has  access  to  them  at  all  times,  including  when  the  Girl \nPlaintiffs use them to change clothes. \n250. Additionally,  to  use  the  swim/athletic  locker  rooms  or  the  nurse’s \noffice, Girl Plaintiffs would have to go into the PE locker room, get their clothes, \nwalk over to the swim/athletic locker rooms or nurse’s office some distance away, \nchange, go back to the PE locker room to stow their clothing, and then go to class. \n251. With 5 minute passing periods between classes, there is not enough \ntime to use the swim/athletic locker rooms or nurse’s office and get to class on time.  \n252. In response to the request for a private restroom facility, the Fremd \nPrincipal told Parent Plaintiffs that if their daughters walk into a restroom where a \n36 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 37 of 83 PageID #:37\nmale student is present, their daughter’s option is to leave and use a different \nrestroom in the school. \n253. This suggested solution is not acceptable for several reasons. \n254. First, Girl Plaintiffs have 5 minutes between classes to: gather their \nthings from the class they are leaving; walk to their locker to put things away and \nget their things for their next class; take care of extra things that may need to do, \nsuch as using the restroom; and walk to the next class, unload their things, and be \nready for class to start.  \n255. Depending on the classes a student has, this can mean that they must \nwalk all the way across the school to go from one class to another.  \n256. Restrooms are a distance apart and there are no restrooms in some \nareas of the school, such as the music wing and applied technology wing.  \n257. Therefore,  there  is  not  enough  time  for  a  Girl  Plaintiff  who  is \nuncomfortable sharing a restroom with a biological male to leave the restroom she \nalready  walked  into,  walk  to  another  restroom  a  distance  away,  attend  to  her \npersonal needs, and then get to class on time.  \n258. This is even more unworkable if there are lines in the girls’ restrooms, \nas there almost always are, or if there is a need to use the restroom immediately. \n259. Secondly, the District’s suggested solution does nothing to alleviate the \nstress and anxiety of having a male student walk in while a Girl Plaintiff is already \nusing the restroom.  \n260. Such a situation is exactly what Parent Plaintiffs object to.  \n37 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 38 of 83 PageID #:38\n261. It is also what makes the restroom environment so hostile to the Girl \nPlaintiffs, since each time they use the restroom they must do so knowing that a \nbiological male can walk in on them. \n262. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy interfere with the \nParent  Plaintiffs’  preferred  moral  and/or  religious  teaching  of  their  children \nconcerning modesty and nudity. \n263. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy interfere with the \nParent Plaintiffs’ right to control whether their children will be exposed to the \nopposite  sex  in  intimate,  vulnerable  settings  like  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and \nshowers. \n264. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy interfere with the \nParent Plaintiffs’ right to control whether their children will be exposed to the \npartially or fully unclothed body of opposite sex persons. \n265. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  Restroom  Policy  interfere  with \nParent  Plaintiffs’  right  to  control  whether  their  children’s  partially  or  fully \nunclothed body is exposed to the opposite sex.  \n266. Because of the Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy, at least \none Parent Plaintiff has decided to send his daughter to private school, instead of a \nDistrict 211 school, when she starts high school next fall.  \n267. Some of the student and parent members of Students and Parents for \nPrivacy are devout Christians whose faith requires that they preserve their modesty \nand not use the restroom, shower, or undress, in the presence of the opposite sex.   \n38 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 39 of 83 PageID #:39\n268. These students and parents also believe that they should not be in the \npresence of a member of the opposite sex while that person is using the restroom, \nshowering, or undressing.   \n269. The  Restroom  Policy  and  Locker  Room  Agreement  are  particularly \nlikely to cause emotional and psychological trauma to girls who have been sexually \nassaulted, for whom the presence of a biological male in their private facilities can \nbe especially unnerving, or even terrifying. \n270. The Centers for Disease Control (the “CDC”) has observed that almost \n12% of high school girls reported that they had already experienced the horror of \nrape.    Center  for  Disease  Control,  Sexual  Violence:  Facts  at  a  Glance  (2012), \navailable at http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf.  \n271. This means that nearly 1 out of every 8 high school girls is likely to \nhave suffered sexual assault. \n272. That statistic compounds the problem with the Restroom Policy and \nthe Locker Room Agreement.   \n273. Whereas  these  policies  cause  stress,  fright,  embarrassment, \nhumiliation, and anxiety for the Student Plaintiffs, they are likely traumatizing to \nother students who have been sexually assaulted.   \nALLEGATIONS OF LAW \n274. All of the student members of Students and Parents for Privacy suffer \nthe loss of their constitutionally-guaranteed right to bodily privacy, as well as their \nright under Title IX to an education that is free from a hostile environment based \n39 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 40 of 83 PageID #:40\non sex, because of the Defendants’ actions, including the Locker Room Agreement \nand/or Restroom Policy. \n275. Additionally, all of the student members of Students and Parents for \nPrivacy  suffer  embarrassment,  humiliation,  anxiety,  intimidation,  fear, \napprehension, stress, degradation, and loss of dignity as a result of the Defendants’ \nactions, including the Locker Room Agreement and/or Restroom Policy. \n276. Defendants’ actions and the Locker Room Agreement and Restroom \nPolicy negatively impact Student Plaintiffs’ ability to receive an education. \n277. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  Restroom  Policy  create  a  hostile \nenvironment where Student Plaintiffs experience sexual harassment and loss of \ndignity at the hands of their school every day.  \n278. The  Federal  Defendants  have  grossly  exceeded  their  statutory \nauthority, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nrights  by  adopting  a  legislative  rule  redefining  “sex”  under  Title  IX  to  include \ngender identity and enforcing that rule in a manner that requires District 211 to \nallow students to use the locker rooms and restrooms of the opposite sex. \n279. The  Federal  Defendants  have  acted  without  observing  the  proper \nadministrative procedure for adopting and enforcing such a new legislative rule, \nwhich includes notice and comment under the APA and presidential approval under \nTitle IX. \n280. It is a violation of the right to bodily privacy to force students to have \ntheir partially or fully unclothed bodies viewed by students of the opposite sex.  \n40 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 41 of 83 PageID #:41\n281. The  right  to  bodily  privacy  also  bars  the  government  from  forcing \nstudents into situations where they risk exposure of their unclothed body to the \nopposite sex. \n282. Minors have a fundamental right to be free from compelled intimate \nexposure of their bodies to members of the opposite sex, which is violated when the \nDefendants force them to use the restrooms and locker rooms with students of the \nopposite sex.  \n283. The  Defendants  are  violating  the  parental  right  to  control  the \nupbringing and education of one’s child by exposing Parent Plaintiffs’ children to \nthe opposite sex in intimate, vulnerable settings like restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshowers, especially where their children, the opposite-sex children, or both, may be \nin a state of undress or even naked. \n284. Providing  single-sex  restrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  shower  facilities \ndoes  not  violate  Title  IX,  so  long  as  the  facilities  provided  for  one  sex  are \ncomparable to the facilities provided to the other sex. \n285. Defendants’  actions  and  the  Locker  Room  and  Restroom  Policies \nviolate Plaintiffs’ free exercise rights under the United States Constitution and \nstate statutory law. \n286. Plaintiffs are suffering and continue to suffer irreparable harm. \n287. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n \n \n \n \n41 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 42 of 83 PageID #:42\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST FEDERAL DEFENDANTS: \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n288.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 287 \nand incorporate them herein. \n289. The  Federal  Defendants  promulgated,  and  are  enforcing,  a  new \nlegislative  rule  that  redefines  the  term  “sex”  in  Title  IX  and  its  accompanying \nregulations to mean, or at least include, “gender identity.” \n290. The DOE has enforced this new redefinition of “sex” as a legislative \nrule against District 211. \n291. The  DOE’s  new  legislative  rule  contradicts  the  text,  structure, \nlegislative history, and historical judicial interpretation of Title IX, all of which \nconfirm that “sex” means male and female in the binary and biological sense.   \n292. According to the DOE’s new legislative rule, Title IX requires schools \nto permit students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers based on their \ngender identity, rather than their biological sex. \n293. The DOE has communicated this new legislative rule to school districts \nnationwide  and  stated  that  their  failure  to  comply  with  it  will  result  in \ninvestigation and enforcement action up to and including withdrawal of millions of \ndollars in federal funding. \n294. The DOE’s promulgation and enforcement of this new legislative rule \nare reviewable actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).   \n295. These DOE actions are reviewable pursuant to 20 U.S.C § 1683. \n42 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 43 of 83 PageID #:43\n296. The  DOE’s  actions  are  also  final  and  there  is  no  other  adequate \nremedy because the Locker Room Agreement binds District 211 such that Plaintiffs \ncannot get relief unless the Agreement is set aside and the Federal Defendants are \nenjoined from continuing to communicate and enforce the new rule changing the \nmeaning of “sex.” \n297. Plaintiffs have suffered a legal wrong as a direct result of the DOE’s \nactions, because Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights were and continue to \nbe violated by the Locker Room Agreement, which is the direct result of the DOE’s \nenforcement of its new rule.  \n298. Under the APA, a reviewing Court must “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action” in four instances that apply to this case:  \n• One:  if  the  agency  action  is  “in  excess  of  statutory  jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C);  \n• Two:  if  the  agency  action  is  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);  \n• Three: if the agency action is “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); and  \n• Four: if the agency action is “without observance of procedure required \nby law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n299. DOE’s action here violates all four of these standards and so should be \nheld unlawful and set aside. \n43 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 44 of 83 PageID #:44\n300. Plaintiffs ask this Court (1) to set aside all three guidance documents, \n(see supra at ¶ 63), to the extent that they incorporate gender identity within the \nmeaning of “sex” for purposes of Title IX, as well as the Locker Room Agreement, \nand (2) to enjoin the DOE and DOJ from further enforcing Title IX in a manner that \nrequires District 211 to give any students the right of entry to, and use of, the \nprivate  facilities  (locker  rooms  and  restrooms)  designated  for  students  of  the \nopposite sex. \nThe DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is In Excess \nof Statutory Jurisdiction, Authority, or Limitations \n \n301. The DOE’s actions in promulgating and enforcing its new rule are “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” \nbecause they redefine the unambiguous term “sex” and add gender identity to Title \nIX without the authorization of Congress.  \n302. Congress has not delegated to the DOE the authority to define, or \nredefine, unambiguous terms in Title IX. \n303. Title IX states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination…”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). \n304. The term “sex” as used in Title IX means male and female, under the \ntraditional binary conception of sex consistent with one’s birth or biological sex.  \n305. This definition is not ambiguous. \n306. Title IX makes no reference to “gender identity” in the language of the \nstatute. \n44 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 45 of 83 PageID #:45\n307. The enacting regulations, which interpret Title IX, likewise make no \nreference to “gender identity.”   \n308. Title  IX’s  implementing  regulations  are  not  ambiguous  in  their \ninstruction that a school district may separate restrooms, locker rooms, and shower \nfacilities on the basis of biological sex. \n309. Title IX permits schools receiving federal funds to “maintain[] separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. \n310. The  regulations  implementing  Title  IX  state  that  schools  receiving \nfederal funding “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex, [as long as] such facilities provided for students of one sex [are] \ncomparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § \n106.33.   \n311. Title IX does not require that District 211 or any other school open its \ngirls’ restrooms, locker rooms and shower rooms to biological males who identify as \nfemale. Nor does it require that they open their boys’ facilities to biological females \nwho identify as male. \n312. The DOE’s unilateral decree that “sex” in Title IX means, or includes, \n“gender identity,” which requires schools to allow males who identify as female to \nuse the girls’ facilities, and vice versa, requires District 211 to give Student A the \nright of entry and use of opposite sex locker and shower rooms, and requires District \n211 to give all students right of entry and use of the restrooms that correspond to \ntheir gender identity, irrespective of their biological sex.   \n45 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 46 of 83 PageID #:46\n313. This  new  rule  is  not  supported  by  Title  IX’s  text,  implementing \nregulations, or legislative history.   \n314. The new rule is contradicted by the fact that every court to consider \nthe question for the past four decades, prior to the DOE’s April 2015 Guidance \nDocument  equating  sex  discrimination  with  gender  identity  discrimination,  had \nconcluded that Title IX did not require cross-sex restrooms or locker rooms, even \nwhen students who identify as the opposite sex are involved.  \n315. The new rule is contradicted by the fact that Congress has repeatedly \nrejected attempts to amend Title IX, or create new law, that would be consistent \nwith the DOE’s rule and application.    \n316. The new rule is contradicted by the fact that Congress has considered \nproposed legislation that would add Title IX style protections for gender identity \ndiscrimination, but has declined to enact it. \n317. Therefore, the DOE’s rule was promulgated and enforced “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority or limitations, or short of statutory right[,]” See 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  This Court should hold that it is unlawful and set it aside.  \n318. Additionally, even if the DOE’s rule was interpretive, it would still be \nin excess of statutory authority and due to be declared unlawful and set aside. \nThe DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is Arbitrary, \nCapricious, An Abuse of Discretion, or Not In Accordance With Law \n \n319. The  DOE’s  actions  in  promulgating  and  enforcing  its  new  rule  are \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n46 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 47 of 83 PageID #:47\n320. Congress requires that whenever an agency takes action it do so after \nengaging in a process by which it “examine[s] the relevant data and articulate[s] a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the \nfacts found and the choice made.” Motor Veh. Mfrs. Ass’n. v. State Farm Ins., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quotation omitted). \n321. An agency action is “arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied \non factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \nascribed to a difference in view or product of agency expertise.” State Farm, 463 \nU.S. at 43. \n322. The DOE gave no explanation whatsoever for its redefinition of “sex” in \nTitle IX, whereby the DOE unilaterally decreed that the term, “sex,” in Title IX \nmeans, or includes, gender identity; requires District 211 to give Student A right of \nentry and use of opposite sex locker and shower rooms; and requires District 211 to \ngive all students access to the facilities that correspond to their gender identity, if \nthe students desire to use them.   \n323. Nor did the DOE give any explanation of the relevant factors that were \nthe basis of its actions. \n324. The DOE failed to consider important aspects of the problems caused \nby mixing biological boys and girls in intimate settings, including the language and \nstructure of Title IX and its regulations; the congressional, and judicial histories of \n47 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 48 of 83 PageID #:48\nTitle IX and its regulations; the practical and constitutional harms created by its \nunlawful  application  of  Title  IX;  and,  the  violation  of  Title  IX  caused  by  this \nunlawful application. \n325. The  DOE’s  action  was  also  made  without  a  rational  explanation, \ninexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on other considerations \nthat Congress could not have intended to make relevant.  \n326. DOE  offered  no  explanation  for  its  rule  redefining  “sex;”  the  rule \ndeparted  from  the  established  Title  IX  policy  that  allowed  schools  to  maintain \nprivate facilities separated by biological sex; and, it rested on considerations related \nto “gender identity,” despite the fact that the legislative history indicates Congress \ndid not intend “sex” to mean anything other than biological sex. \n327. The DOE’s action was also made even though it is contrary to law or \nregulation.  \n328. The DOE’s rule purporting to redefine Title IX violates Title IX as it \napplies to the very group Title IX was created to protect, girls, by creating a hostile \nenvironment for the Girl Plaintiffs. \n329. The DOE’s promulgation and enforcement of its rule is thus arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law.  This Court \nshould therefore hold that it is unlawful and set it aside.  \n330. Additionally, even if the DOE’s rule was interpretive, it would still be \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law, and so \nis due to be declared unlawful and set aside. \n48 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 49 of 83 PageID #:49\n \n The DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is Contrary \nto Constitutional Right, Power, Privilege, or Immunity \n \n331. The  DOE’s  actions  are  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power, \nprivilege, or immunity.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n332. The  DOE’s  legislative  rule  is  an  unlawful  application  of  Title  IX \ncontrary  to  the  Constitution  because  it  violates  the  privacy  rights  of  Student \nPlaintiffs, their parents’ fundamental liberty interest in controlling their children’s \nupbringing  and  education,  and  the  rights  of  some  Student  Plaintiffs  and  their \nparents to freely live out their religious beliefs. See Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, and \nSeventh Causes of Action. \n333. Also, the DOE’s legislative rule is in violation of the Spending Clause \nof the United States Constitution, under which Title IX was enacted.  \n334. When  Congress  uses  its  Spending  Clause  power,  it  generates \nlegislation much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States \nagree to comply with federally imposed conditions. \n335. Congress  must  clearly  and  unambiguously  state  the  conditions  to \nwhich the States are agreeing in exchange for federal funds, so that the States can \nknowingly decide whether to accept the funding. \n336. The crucial inquiry is whether Congress spoke so clearly that it can be \nfairly said that the State could make an informed choice. \n337. Requiring  schools  to  allow  biological  males  access  to  facilities \ndesignated for girls cannot pass this test, no matter how the males identify.  \n49 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 50 of 83 PageID #:50\n338. As already explained, the plain language of the text, along with the \nlegislative history, clearly indicates that Congress intended that (1) “sex” means \n“biological sex;” (2) Title IX prevents discrimination based on biological sex; and (3) \nTitle IX allows sex-separated restrooms and locker rooms. \n339. Further,  the  implementing  regulations  specifically  allow  schools  to \nmaintain restrooms and locker rooms separated by biological sex. \n340. Thus,  for  the  over  40  years  of  Title  IX’s  existence,  it  has  been \nuniversally understood by schools that receive federal education funding that Title \nIX’s definition of “sex” does not include gender identity. \n341. It has likewise been universally understood by schools that received \nfederal education funding that maintaining separate restrooms, locker rooms, and \nother private facilities on the basis of biological sex is consistent with Title IX. \n342. No school could have possibly made an informed choice, because no \nschool could have known that the funds it agreed to accept were conditioned on \nallowing  cross-sex  private  facilities,  or  otherwise  recognizing  gender  identity  as \nwithin the meaning of the term “sex.” \n343. For these reasons, this Court should hold the DOE’s actions unlawful, \nset aside its guidance documents and the Locker Room Agreement, and enjoin it, \nalong with the DOJ, from further communicating the new rule that “sex” in Title IX \nincludes “gender identity” to District 211. \n50 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 51 of 83 PageID #:51\n344. Additionally, even if the DOE’s rule was interpretive, it would still be \ncontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity, and so is due to be \ndeclared unlawful and set aside. \nThe DOE’s Action Is Unlawful Under the APA Because It Is Without \nObservance of Procedure Required By Law \n \n345. The  DOE’s  actions  were  done  “without  observance  of  procedure \nrequired by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n346. As explained above, the DOE has promulgated a new rule, unilaterally \ndeclaring that Title IX’s term, “sex,” means, or includes, “gender identity,” and so \nTitle IX prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. \n347. The DOE’s new rule also requires schools, including District 211, to \nallow biological males entry and usage of restrooms and locker rooms designated for \ngirls, and vice versa. \n348. Further, the Federal Defendants have given this rule the full force of \nlaw, investigating and enforcing it against District 211 to require the Locker Room \nAgreement.  \n349. The rule imposes rights and obligations, and through administrative \nenforcement actions, binds school districts. \n350. The rule also applies generally to all school districts.  \n351. Under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  any  “rules  which  do  not \nmerely  interpret  existing  law  or  announce  tentative  policy  positions  but  which \nestablish new policy positions that the agency treats as binding must comply with \n51 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 52 of 83 PageID #:52\nthe APA’s notice-and-comment requirements, regardless of how they initially are \nlabeled.” 72 Fed. Reg. 3433. \n352. The Supreme Court has additionally ruled that all legislative rules, \nwhich are those having the force and effect of law and are accorded weight in \nagency  adjudicatory  processes,  must  go  through  the  notice-and-comment \nrequirements. Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1204 (2015). \n353. “Notice-and-comment rulemaking” requires that the DOE (1) issue a \ngeneral notice to the public of the proposed rule-making, typically by publishing \nnotice in the Federal Register; (2) give interested parties an opportunity to submit \nwritten data, views, or arguments on the proposed rule, and consider and respond to \nsignificant comments received; and (3) include in the promulgation of the final rule \na concise general statement of the rule’s basis and purpose. \n354. Notice-and-comment rulemaking also requires that the DOE consider \nall the relevant comments offered during the public comment period before finally \ndeciding whether to adopt the proposed rule. \n355. Additionally,  under  Title  IX,  final  rules,  regulations,  and  orders  of \ngeneral applicability issued by the DOE must be approved by the president of the \nUnited States.  \n356. The DOE promulgated and enforced its new rule redefining “sex” in \nTitle IX to include gender identity without notice and comment as required by law. \n5 U.S.C. § 553. It promulgated this new legislative rule without signature by the \npresident as required by Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n52 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 53 of 83 PageID #:53\n357. Simply stated, the DOE did not follow the required procedure when it \nadopted its new rule defining “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender identity.  \nThis Court should therefore hold that it is unlawful and set it aside. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DISTRICT 211  \nAND THE FEDERAL DEFENDANTS: \nVIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY  \n \n358. Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 357 \nand incorporate them herein. \n359. “Fundamental rights” are grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nDue Process Clause. \n360. They are rights that are deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \ntradition and are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n361. Numerous  courts,  including  the  Seventh  Circuit,  have  recognized  a \nfundamental right to bodily privacy. \n362. This  right  includes  a  right  to  privacy  in  one’s  fully  or  partially \nunclothed body. \n363. It  also  includes  the  right  to  be  free  from  State-compelled  risk  of \nintimate exposure of oneself to the opposite sex. \n364. The Student Plaintiffs, like everyone else, enjoy the fundamental right \nto bodily privacy.  \n53 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 54 of 83 PageID #:54\n365. The right to be free from State-compelled risk of intimate exposure of \noneself  to  the  opposite  sex,  while  part  of  the  right  to  bodily  privacy,  is  also \nseparately and deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition and implicit in \nthe concept of ordered liberty. \n366. Throughout its history, American law and society has had a national \ncommitment to protecting citizens, and especially children, from suffering the risk \nof exposing their bodies, or their intimate activities, to the opposite sex. \n367. From colonial times, the law allowed civil actions against “Peeping \nToms.” \n368. As  American  law  developed  after  the  Founding,  it  criminalized \nsurreptitiously viewing others while they reasonably expect privacy. \n369. This protection is heightened for children. \n370. While  pornography  involving  only  adults  is  legal  and  cannot  be \nconstitutionally banned, federal law makes it a crime to possess, distribute, or even \nview images of naked children. \n371. Nearly every state has a law criminalizing “sexting,” which is when \nsomeone (often a minor) sends a naked picture of herself via email, text messaging, \nor other electronic means. \n372. The state of Illinois has such a law. See 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. § \n5/11-21 (crime for anyone to transmit nude photo to minor).   \n54 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 55 of 83 PageID #:55\n373. In the late 1800s, as women began entering the workforce, the law \ndeveloped to protect privacy by mandating that work place restrooms and changing \nrooms be separated by sex. \n374. Massachusetts adopted the first such law in 1887. \n375. By 1920, 43 of the (then) 48 states had similar laws protecting privacy \nby mandating sex-separated facilities in the workplace. \n376. Because  of  our  national  commitment  to  protect  our  citizens,  and \nespecially children, from the risk of being exposed to the anatomy of the opposite \nsex, as well as the risk of being seen by the opposite sex while attending to private, \nintimate needs, sex-separated restrooms and locker rooms are ubiquitous in public \nplaces.  \n377. Using  public  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  separated  by  sex  are  an \nAmerican social and modesty norm. \n378. Historically,  purposefully  entering  a  restroom  or  locker  room \ndesignated for the opposite biological sex has been considered wrongful, and even \ncriminal, behavior.  \n379. Sex-separated restrooms and locker rooms are also ubiquitous in public \nschools.  \n380. Historically, there has been no mixing of the biological sexes in school \nrestrooms or locker rooms.  \n55 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 56 of 83 PageID #:56\n381. A  girls’  locker  room  or  restroom  has  always  been  a  place  that  by \ndefinition is to be used exclusively by girls and where biological males are not \nallowed.  \n382. Freedom from the risk of compelled intimate exposure to the opposite \nsex, especially for minors, is deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition. \n383. It is also implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n384. The ability to be clothed in the presence of the opposite biological sex, \nalong with the freedom to use the restroom and locker room away from the presence \nof the opposite biological sex, is fundamental to most people’s sense of self respect \nand personal dignity.  \n385. If the government were granted the far-reaching and extreme power to \ncompel its citizens to disrobe or risk being unclothed in the presence of the opposite \nsex, then little personal liberty involving our bodies would be left.    \n386. Because freedom from the risk of compelled exposure to the opposite \nbiological sex, especially for minors, is deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \ntradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, it is a fundamental right. \n387. Specifically: minors have a fundamental right to be free from State-\ncompelled risk of exposure of their bodies, or their intimate activities, such as occur \nwithin restrooms and locker rooms, to the opposite biological sex. \n388. The  government  may  not  infringe  fundamental  rights,  unless  the \ninfringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires that the government \n56 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 57 of 83 PageID #:57\ndemonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compelling interest in the least \nrestrictive means available. \n389. The Locker Room Agreement allows Student A, a biological male, the \nright of entry to, and use of, the girls’ locker rooms any time he wants. \n390. The Restroom Policy allows biologically male students who identify as \nfemale access and use of the girls’ restrooms. \n391. The  Restroom  Policy  also  allows  biological  female  students  who \nidentify as male access and use of the boys’ restrooms. \n392. The Locker Room Agreement and the Restroom Policy both require the \nStudent Plaintiffs to risk being intimately exposed to those of the opposite biological \nsex. \n393. The Locker Room Agreement and the Restroom Policy both infringe \nthe Student Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to privacy in their unclothed bodies, as \nwell  as  their  fundamental  right  to  be  free  from  government-compelled  risk  of \nintimate exposure to the opposite sex, without any compelling justification.  \n394. Defendants  have  no  compelling  interest  to  justify  forcing  school \nchildren to share restrooms and locker rooms with opposite sex classmates.  \n395. Also, Defendants have not used the least restrictive means of serving \nany interest they may have. \n396. Accordingly, the Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy both \nfail the required strict scrutiny review and are unconstitutional as applied to any \nminor, including the Student Plaintiffs.  \n57 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 58 of 83 PageID #:58\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DISTRICT 211  \nAND THE FEDERAL DEFENDANTS: \nVIOLATION OF PARENTS’ FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DIRECT THE \nEDUCATION AND UPBRINGING OF THEIR CHILDREN \n \n397. Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 396 \nand incorporate them herein.   \n398. The right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, \nand control of their children is a fundamental right protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process Clause. \n399. Included within that parental fundamental right is the power to direct \nthe education and upbringing of one’s children. \n400. It  gives  parents  the  right,  as  well  as  the  duty,  to  instill  moral \nstandards and values in their children. \n401. Parents’ right and duty to instill moral standards and values in their \nchildren, and to direct their education and upbringing, encompasses the right to \ndetermine  whether,  and  when,  their  minor  children  endure  the  risk  of  being \nexposed  to  members  of  the  opposite  sex  in  intimate,  vulnerable  settings  like \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and showers. \n402. Parents  also  have  a  fundamental  right  to  determine  whether  their \nchildren will have to risk being exposed to opposite sex nudity at school and a \nfundamental right to determine whether their children, while at school, will have to \n58 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 59 of 83 PageID #:59\nrisk exposing their own undressed or partially unclothed bodies to members of the \nopposite sex. \n403. It is not for the Defendants to say whether, and when, minor children \nwill risk being exposed to the opposite sex in such settings: it is each parents’ right \nto decide for his or her own child.   \n404. Nor is it for the Defendants to say that minor children must risk being \nexposed to opposite-sex nudity, when those children’s parents object.  \n405. Nor  is  it  for  the  Defendants  to  say  that  minor  children  must  risk \nexposing their own bodies to members of the opposite sex, when those children’s \nparents object. \n406. All of the Parent Plaintiffs object to the Locker Room Agreement and \nthe Restroom Policy. \n407. All of the Parent Plaintiffs agree that they do not want their minor \nchildren  to  endure  the  risk  of  being  exposed  to  the  opposite  sex  in  intimate, \nvulnerable settings like restrooms, locker rooms, and showers, nor do they want \ntheir minor children to attend to their personal, private bodily needs in the presence \nof members of the opposite sex. \n408. All of the Parent Plaintiffs desire to raise their children with a respect \nfor traditional modesty, which requires that one not undress or use the restroom in \nthe presence of the opposite sex. \n59 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 60 of 83 PageID #:60\n409. All  of  the  Parent  Plaintiffs  desire  to  prevent  their  children  from \nenduring the risk of being observed while undressing by members of the opposite \nsex. \n410. All of the Parent Plaintiffs also desire to prevent their children from \nenduring the risk of being exposed to the unclothed body of members of the opposite \nsex. \n411. Some of the Parent Plaintiffs object to the Locker Room Agreement \nand Restroom policy for religious reasons because of their sincerely held religious \nbeliefs about modesty and other religious doctrines. \n412. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  Restroom  Policy,  instituted  and \nenforced by the Defendants, make it impossible for the Parent Plaintiffs to direct \nthe upbringing and education of their children.   \n413. Accordingly, the Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy infringe \nthe Parent Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of \ntheir children.  \n414. Defendants may not infringe fundamental rights, including parents’ \nfundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children, unless \nthe infringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires that Defendants \ndemonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compelling interest in the least \nrestrictive manner available. \n415. Defendants  have  no  compelling  interest  to  justify  forcing  school \nchildren to share restrooms and locker rooms with opposite sex classmates.  \n60 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 61 of 83 PageID #:61\n416. Also, Defendants have not used the least restrictive means of serving \nany interest they may have. \n417. Accordingly, the Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy both \nfail the required strict scrutiny review and are unconstitutional infringements on \nparents’ fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DISTRICT 211: \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX \n418.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 417 \nand incorporate them herein. \n419. Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n420. Courts  have  given  Title  IX  broad  effect  in  order  to  combat  sex \ndiscrimination in the educational setting. \n421. Title  IX  is  a  broadly  written  general  prohibition  on  discrimination \nbased  on  sex,  and  so  it  does  not  explicitly  list  every  discriminatory  act  that  it \nprohibits.  \n422. There is an implied right of action under Title IX. \n423. There  is  no  requirement  that  a  claimant  exhaust  administrative \nremedies before bringing a Title IX cause of action. \n61 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 62 of 83 PageID #:62\n424. Allowing people to use restrooms or locker rooms that are designated \nfor the opposite biological sex violates privacy and creates a sexually harassing \nhostile environment.  \n425. Exposure to opposite-sex nudity creates a sexually harassing hostile \nenvironment. \n426. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy allow some students \nto use locker rooms and restrooms that are designated for the opposite biological \nsex. \n427. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy needlessly subject \nthe Student Plaintiffs to the risk that their partially or fully unclothed bodies will \nbe exposed to the opposite sex and that they will be exposed to opposite-sex nudity. \n428. As  a  result,  the  Student  Plaintiffs  experience  embarrassment, \nhumiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss \nof dignity. \n429. Some of the Student Plaintiffs are avoiding the restroom as a result of \nthe embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, stress, \ndegradation, and loss of dignity they experience because of the Restroom Policy. \n430. Some of the Student Plaintiffs are not able to concentrate as well in \nschool as they did before because of these policies. \n431. All of the Student Plaintiffs find that school has become intimidating \nand stressful as a result of the Locker Room Agreement and/or the Restroom Policy, \n62 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 63 of 83 PageID #:63\nand the Girl Plaintiffs find that the locker rooms have become intimidating and \nstressful as a result of the Locker Room Agreement.   \n432. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  Restroom  Policy  violate  Title  IX \nbecause  they  produce  unwelcome  sexual  harassment  and  create  a  hostile \nenvironment on the basis of sex. \n433. There are five elements necessary to make out a Title IX claim: (1) \nplaintiff belongs to a protected group; (2) plaintiff was subjected to harassment; (3) \nthe harassment was based on sex; (4) the harassment was so pervasive or severe \nthat it altered the conditions of plaintiff's education; and (5) knowledge by school \nofficials. \n434. The Student Plaintiffs satisfy all five elements. \n435. First, the Student Plaintiffs belong to a protected group because they \nare female and male students at an educational institution that receives federal \nfunds.  \n436. Second, the Student Plaintiffs are subjected to harassment because the \nLocker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy allow biological males to use girls’ \nlocker  rooms  and  restrooms,  and  also  allow  biological  females  to  use  the  boys’ \nrestrooms, which creates a sexually harassing hostile environment. \n437. Third, this harassment is based on sex. \n438. There are real and significant differences between the biological sexes.  \n439. These differences include, among other things, differences in anatomy \nand physiology.  \n63 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 64 of 83 PageID #:64\n440. These differences do not disappear when biological males identify as \nfemale, and vice versa. \n441. The  biological  and  anatomical  differences  between  the  sexes  is  the \nreason that Title IX and its implementing regulations allow for separate living \nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas for each biological sex.  \n442. The  allowance  for  separate  facilities  is  based  on  Title  IX  and  its \nimplementing regulations’ recognition that each biological sex has unique needs and \nvulnerabilities when using these facilities.   \n443. Title  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  allow  for  separate  living \nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas for each biological sex based \non the recognition that permitting a biological male to enter and use such facilities \ndesignated for females would be sexually harassing to the females.     \n444. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy, which open the \ngirls’ restrooms and locker rooms to biological males, is harassment based on the \ngirls’ sex. \n445. Title  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  allow  for  separate  living \nfacilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas for each biological sex based \non  the  recognition  that  permitting  a  biological  female  to  enter  and  use  such \nfacilities designated for males would be sexually harassing to the males. \n446. The  Restroom  Policy,  which  opens  the  boys’  restrooms  to  biological \nfemales, is harassment based on the boys’ sex.   \n64 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 65 of 83 PageID #:65\n447. Moreover,  both  male  and  female  Student  Plaintiffs  experience \nhumiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss \nof  dignity  as  a  result  of  the  Locker  Room  Agreement  and/or  Restroom  Policy \npermitting the opposite sex to be in locker rooms and restrooms designated for their \nbiological sex.  \n448. It is the significant and real differences between the biological sexes \nthat creates the hostile environment, which is harassment. \n449. Fourth, the harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive. \n450. To satisfy this fourth element, the harassment need only be severe or \npervasive.   \n451. The harassment created by the Locker Room Agreement and Restroom \nPolicy is both.  \n452. The harassment is ongoing and continuous, occurring every time the \nfemale Student Plaintiffs use the locker room, and every time any of the Student \nPlaintiffs use the restroom.   \n453. This satisfies the pervasiveness prong. \n454. Letting biological males use the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms, and \nallowing biological females to use the boys’ restrooms, places the bodily privacy of \nboth sexes at risk, and so is sufficiently egregious to satisfy the severity prong. \n455. The environment is one that a reasonable person would find hostile or \nabusive, and one that the Student Plaintiffs in fact perceive to be so. \n65 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 66 of 83 PageID #:66\n456. The  sexually  harassing  hostile  environment  is  threatening  and \nhumiliating,  and  altered  the  conditions  of  the  Student  Plaintiffs’  educational \nopportunities, benefits, programs, and/or activities.  \n457. Fifth, school officials are aware of the hostile environment. \n458. In  fact,  District  211’s  official  policies—the  Locker  Room  Agreement \nand Restroom Policy—are the direct cause of this hostile environment. \n459. Some of the Student Plaintiffs, and some of the Parent Plaintiffs, have \nalerted District 211 officials about the hostile environment. \n460. Those officials have authority to stop the hostile environment.  \n461. These officials include Fremd High School’s principal, as well as the \nDistrict superintendent.  \n462. Despite  their  knowledge  that  their  policies  are  creating  a  hostile \nenvironment based on sex, the Defendants have not remedied the situation.  \n463. Instead, these officials have advised that, if the students perceive the \nenvironment  to  be  hostile,  the  students  should  remove  themselves  from  it  by \naccepting an “accommodation” or using a different restroom. \n464. Schools cannot escape liability for Title IX violations by requiring the \nvictim of harassment to remove herself from the hostile environment or otherwise \nsuggesting that she is responsible for the harassment she endures. \n465. Additionally, the accommodations themselves violate Title IX. \n66 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 67 of 83 PageID #:67\n466. Some of the Girl Plaintiffs have been told that instead of using the \nlocker room to change for PE class, they may change their clothing in a nurse’s \noffice located on the other side of the school. \n467. This  facility  for  changing  is  inferior  to  the  locker  room  facilities \nprovided for boy students. \n468. This violates 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, which provides that schools receiving \nfederal funding “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on \nthe basis of sex, [as long as] such facilities provided for students of one sex [are] \ncomparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” \n469. Additionally, some of the Student Plaintiffs have been told that, if they \nare  uncomfortable  using  a  restroom  because  a  member  of  the  opposite  sex  is \npresent, they may find another restroom. \n470. Because  there  are  only  five  minutes  between  classes,  any  student \nleaving one restroom to hunt for another is almost certain to be tardy. \n471. The students will also miss instructional time.   \n472. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy violate Title IX by \ncreating a hostile environment on the basis of sex. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \n \n \n \n67 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 68 of 83 PageID #:68\nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DISTRICT 211: \nVIOLATION OF THE \nILLINOIS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT \n473. Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 472 \nand incorporate them herein. \n474. The Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) provides in \npertinent part: \nGovernment  may  not  substantially  burden  a  person’s  exercise  of \nreligion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, \nunless it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person (i) \nis in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and (ii) is the \nleast  restrictive  means  of  furthering  that  compelling  governmental \ninterest. \n \n775 ILCS 35/15.   \n475.  Many of the Student Plaintiffs have a religious requirement that they \npractice modesty.  These students have the sincere religious belief that they must \nnot undress, or use the restroom, in the presence of the opposite biological sex, and \nalso that they must not be in the presence of the opposite biological sex while the \nopposite biological sex is undressing or using the restroom.   \n476. Many of the Parent Plaintiffs have the sincere religious belief that they \nmust teach their children to practice modesty.  Their religious faith also requires \nthem to protect the modesty of their children.  These parents have the sincere \nreligious belief that their children must not undress, or use the restroom, in the \npresence of a member of the opposite biological sex, and also that they must not be \nin the presence of the opposite biological sex while the opposite biological sex is \nundressing or using the restroom.   \n68 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 69 of 83 PageID #:69\n477.  The  Restroom  Policy  requires  the  Student  Plaintiffs  to  use  the \nrestroom while knowing that a member of the opposite biological sex could enter the \nrestroom while they are using it. \n478. The Locker Room Agreement requires the Girl Plaintiffs to use the \nlocker rooms and shower rooms, knowing that a biological male either is present \nwith them, or could enter while they are using these private facilities. \n479. The Restroom Policy and Locker Room Agreement prevent the Student \nPlaintiffs from practicing the modesty that their faith requires of them.   \n480. The Restroom Policy and Locker Room Agreement prevent the Parent \nPlaintiffs from teaching their children traditional modesty, and insisting that their \nchildren practice modesty, as their faith requires of the Parent Plaintiffs.    \n481. Complying with the requirements of the Restroom Policy and Locker \nRoom Agreement thus places a substantial burden on the Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nreligion. \n482. It is a substantial burden to require Plaintiffs’ to choose between the \nbenefit of a free public education and violating their religious beliefs. \n483. The state has no “compelling interest” that would justify burdening the \nPlaintiffs’ exercise of religion in this manner. \n484. Additionally, the state has not used the “least restrictive means” to \nachieve its purported interest in burdening the Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion in this \nmanner. \n69 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 70 of 83 PageID #:70\n485. The Locker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy accordingly violate \nthe Plaintiffs’ rights under the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST THE FEDERAL DEFENDANTS: \nVIOLATION OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT \n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb \n \n486. Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 485 \nand incorporate them herein. \n487. Many of the Student Plaintiffs have a religious requirement that they \npractice modesty.  These students have the sincere religious belief that they must \nnot undress, or use the restroom, in the presence of the opposite biological sex, and \nalso that they must not be in the presence of the opposite biological sex while the \nopposite biological sex is undressing or using the restroom.   \n488. Many of the Parent Plaintiffs have the sincere religious belief that they \nmust teach their children to practice modesty.  Their religious faith also requires \nthem to protect the modesty of their children.  These parents have the sincere \nreligious belief that their children must not undress, or use the restroom, in the \npresence of a member of the opposite biological sex, and also that they must not be \nin the presence of the opposite biological sex while the opposite biological sex is \nundressing or using the restroom.   \n489. The  Locker  Room  Agreement—which  was  mandated  by  the  federal \nDefendants—requires the Girl Plaintiffs to use the locker rooms and shower rooms, \n70 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 71 of 83 PageID #:71\nknowing that a biological male either is present with them, or could enter while \nthey are using these private facilities. \n490. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  prevents  the  Student  Plaintiffs  from \npracticing the modesty that their faith requires of them.   \n491. The  Locker  Room  Agreement  prevents  the  Parent  Plaintiffs  from \nteaching  their  children  traditional  modesty,  and  insisting  that  their  children \npractice modesty, as their faith requires of the Parent Plaintiffs.    \n492. Complying with the requirements of the Locker Room Agreement thus \nplaces a substantial burden on the Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. \n493. It is a substantial burden to require Plaintiffs’ to choose between the \nbenefit of a free public education and violating their religious beliefs. \n494. The  federal  Defendants  have  no  “compelling  interest”  that  would \njustify burdening the Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion in this manner. \n495. Additionally,  the  federal  Defendants  have  not  used  the  “least \nrestrictive means” to achieve their purported interest in burdening the Plaintiffs’ \nexercise of religion in this manner. \n496. The Locker Room Agreement accordingly violates the Plaintiffs’ rights \nprotected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \n \n \n71 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 72 of 83 PageID #:72\nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DISTRICT 211  \nAND THE FEDERAL DEFENDANTS: \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT’S GUARANTEE OF  \nFREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION \n \n497. Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 496 \nand incorporate them herein. \n498. The  First  Amendment  provides  that  Congress  shall  make  no  law \nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. \n499. The  Restroom  Policy  and  Locker  Room  Agreement  burden  the  free \nexercise rights of some of the Plaintiffs.  See supra, Fifth and Sixth Causes of \nAction. \n500. Laws  that  burden  free  exercise,  but  are  not  neutral  or  generally \napplicable, are subject to strict scrutiny.   \n501. The Restroom Policy is not generally applicable because it does not \nallow all students to use the opposite-sex restrooms, but only students who perceive \nthemselves as a different gender than their biological sex. \n502. Similarly, the Locker Room Agreement is not generally applicable.    \n503. The Locker Room Agreement applies only to one student, Student A.   \n504. The Locker Room Agreement does not apply to all students, allowing \nthem to access whatever locker and shower rooms they want.   \n505. The Locker Room Agreement does not even apply to all students who \nperceive their gender identity to be different than their biological sex.   \n72 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 73 of 83 PageID #:73\n506. Because  the  Restroom  Policy  and  Locker  Room  Agreement  are  not \ngenerally applicable, they are subject to strict scrutiny, which they fail.  See supra, \nFifth and Sixth Causes of Action.   \n507. Additionally,  the  Restroom  Policy  and  Locker  Room  Agreement  are \nsubject to strict scrutiny because, in addition to burdening free exercise rights, the \npolicies also burden other constitutional rights.  \n508. Both the Locker Room Agreement and the Restroom Policy violate the \nStudent Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to be free from compelled risk of exposure of \ntheir bodies to the opposite biological sex. See supra, Second Cause of Action. \n509. Additionally,  both  the  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  the  Restroom \nPolicy violate the Student Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to privacy in their unclothed \nbodies.  See id. \n510.   Additionally,  both  the  Locker  Room  Agreement  and  the  Restroom \nPolicy violate the Parent Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to direct the education and \nupbringing of their children.  See supra, Third Cause of Action. \n511. Accordingly, both the Restroom Policy and Locker Room Agreement \nare subject to strict scrutiny, which they fail.  See supra, Fifth and Sixth Causes of \nAction.   \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \n \n \n73 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 74 of 83 PageID #:74\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  pray  for  judgment  as  follows  and \nrequest the following relief: \nA. That  this  Court  enter  a  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction \nrestraining all Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, and all other persons \nacting  in  concert  with  them,  from  enforcing  the  Locker  Room  Agreement,  and \nDistrict  211,  their  officers,  agents,  employees,  and  all  other  persons  acting  in \nconcert with them, from enforcing the Restroom Policy, and ordering them to permit \nonly  biological  females  to  enter  and  use  District  211’s  girls’  locker  rooms  and \nrestrooms and only biological boys to enter and use District 211’s boys’ restrooms; \nB. That this Court hold unlawful and set aside the federal Defendants’ \nnew rule that redefines the word “sex” in Title IX to mean, or include, gender \nidentity, which it announced in at least the following documents—U.S. Department \nof Education, Office for Civil Rights, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual \nViolence,  5  (Apr.  2014);  U.S.  Department  of  Education,  Office  for  Civil  Rights, \nQuestions  and  Answers  on  Title  IX  and  Single-Sex  Elementary  and  Secondary \nClasses  and  Extracurricular  Activities,  25  (Dec.  2014);  U.S.  Department  of \nEducation, Office for Civil Rights, Title IX Resource Guide, 1, 15, 16, 19, 21-22 (Apr. \n2015); \nC. That  this  Court  enter  a  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction \nrestraining the federal Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, and all other \npersons acting in concert with them, from taking any action based on DOE’s new \n74 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 75 of 83 PageID #:75\nrule  that  redefines  the  word  “sex”  in  Title  IX,  including  implementing  the \nrevocation of funding as indicated in the Letter of Findings sent to District 211 and \nfrom  communicating  to  District  211  through  these  documents  or  in  any  other \nmanner that the term “sex” means, or includes, gender identity or that Title IX bars \ngender identity discrimination or mandates that regulated entities allow students \nto use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers based on their gender identity; \nD. That  this  Court  enter  a  declaratory  judgment  declaring  that  the \nLocker Room Agreement and Restroom Policy impermissibly burden the Student \nPlaintiffs’  constitutional  right  to  privacy;  impermissibly  burden  the  Student \nPlaintiffs’  constitutional  right  to  be  free  from  State-compelled  risk  of  intimate \nexposure of themselves and their intimate activities to members of the opposite sex; \nimpermissibly  burden  the  Parent  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  right  to  direct  the \nupbringing and education of their children; violate Title IX; violate the rights of \nsome of the Student Plaintiffs and Parent Plaintiffs under the Illinois Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act; violate the rights of some of the Student Plaintiffs and \nParent Plaintiffs under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act; and violate \nthe constitutional guarantee to free exercise of religion for some of the Student \nPlaintiffs and Parent Plaintiffs under the Free Exercise Clause. \nE. That  this  Court  award  nominal  damages  in  the  amount  of  one  (1) \ndollar, and compensatory damages, for the violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional and \nstatutory rights, except those claimed under the Administrative Procedure Act; \n75 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/16 Page 76 of 83 PageID #:76\nF.

That  this  Court  issue  the  requested  injunctive  relief  without  a \ncondition of bond or other security being required of Plaintiffs; and \nI.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nEASTERN DIVISION \n \nSTUDENTS AND PARENTS FOR     \nPRIVACY, a voluntary unincorporated     \nassociation; C.A., a minor, by and through her     \nparent and guardian, N.A.; A.M., a minor, by  Case No. 16-cv-4945 \nand through her parents and guardians S.M.   \nand R.M.; N.G., a minor, by and through her   \nparent and guardian R.G.; A.V., a minor, by   \nand through her parents and guardians T.V.  Judge  Jorge L. Alonso \nand A.T.V.; and B.W., a minor, a minor, by \nand through his parents and guardians, D.W. \nand V.W.,  \n  Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nEDUCATION; JOHN B. KING, JR., in his \nofficial capacity as United States Secretary of \nEducation; UNITED STATES \nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, LORETTA E. \nLYNCH, in her official capacity as United \nStates Attorney General, and SCHOOL \nDIRECTORS OF TOWNSHIP HIGH \nSCHOOL DISTRICT 211, COUNTY OF \nCOOK AND STATE OF ILLINOIS,  \n  Defendants. \n \nand  \n \nSTUDENTS A, B, AND C, by and through \ntheir parents and guardians, Parents A, B, and \nC; and the ILLINOIS SAFE SCHOOLS \nALLIANCE,  \n  Intervenors-Defendants \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \n  For the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ objections [146] to the Report and Recommendation \nof the Magistrate Judge [134] are overruled and the Report and Recommendation is adopted.    \n \n1 \n \n\nBackground \n \n  Plaintiffs,  Students  and  Parents  for  Privacy,  an  unincorporated  association,  and  five \ncurrent or prospective students of Township High School District 211, brought this action against \nthe United States Department of Education, the United States Department of Justice (together \nwith  the  Secretary  of  Education  and  the  Attorney  General  collectively,  “the  Federal \nDefendants”), and the School Directors of Township High School District 211 (“District 211” or \n“the District”) challenging the District’s policy of allowing transgender students to use the \nrestrooms consistent with their gender identity, a federal rule requiring schools in the United \nStates to allow students to use sex-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity, and \nan agreement that the Department of Education had entered into with District 211 by which \nStudent A, a transgender girl, was allowed to use the girls’ locker room at William Fremd High \nSchool.    [Dkt  1.]    Plaintiffs  alleged  that  the  Department  of  Education  had  violated  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 500, et seq., in issuing the rule, and that the policy and \nthe agreement violate Girl Plaintiffs’1 rights to privacy and to an equal education.  Plaintiffs also \nbrought claims for violation of their parental right to direct the education and upbringing of their \nchildren, the Illinois and Federal Religious Restoration Act, and the Free Exercise of the First \nAmendment.   The factual background of the case is laid out in great detail in the Magistrate \nJudge’s Report and Recommendation, and is not repeated here.  [Dkt 134.]   \n  Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction seeking to require the District to segregate \nrestrooms and locker rooms on the basis of students’ biological sex which Plaintiffs consider to \nbe sex assigned at birth, by enjoining the federal rule, enjoining the District’s policy, and \nenjoining the agreement regarding Student A.  [Dkt 21.]  The motion was premised on Plaintiffs’ \n                                                            \n1 For  convenience  and  consistency,  the  Court  adopts  the  terms  Plaintiffs  use  to  describe \nthemselves, like “Girl Plaintiffs” and “Student Plaintiffs.”   \n2 \n \n\nAdministrative Procedure Act claim, their constitutional privacy claim, and their claim under \nTitle IX (Counts I, II, and IV).  Pursuant to Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe motion was referred to the Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation.  [Dkt 24, 26.]    \nShortly after Plaintiffs filed their motion, District 211 sought leave to conduct discovery \non it.  Plaintiffs successfully opposed the District’s efforts, arguing that their claims rested on a \nfacial challenge and not on any specific interaction in any particular restroom or locker room \nbetween any plaintiff and Student A or anyone else, but only on the fact that Student A, who \nPlaintiffs call a biological boy, is or could be present in the girls’ restroom and locker room.  \n[Dkt 50 at 4-5.]   During oral argument on the motion, Plaintiffs narrowed the scope of their \nrequested  relief  from  enjoining  the  federal  rule  outright  to  only  asking  that  the  Federal \nDefendants be enjoined from “further application of the rule to force District 211 to comply with \nit in the operation of its facilities.”   [Dkt 127 at 155.]   \nAlso during the pendency of the motion, Student A, along with Students B and C, by and \nthrough their parents and legal guardians, and the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance, were allowed to \nintervene in the case.  [Dkt 56.]   \nAfter extensive briefing and oral argument, the Magistrate Judge issued a comprehensive \nand well-reasoned report in which he recommended denying Plaintiffs’ motion upon a finding \nthat they had not made any of the threshold showings for a preliminary injunction.  [Dkt 134.]  \nSpecifically, he found that Plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the \nmerits that the Administrative Procedure Act had been violated, that the District or the Federal \nDefendants were violating Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy, or that the District was \nviolating Title IX by permitting transgender students to use restrooms consistent with their \ngender identity and allowing Student A to use the girls’ locker room.  Even if Plaintiffs had \n3 \n \n\nshown a likelihood of success on the merits, the Magistrate Judge found, they still would not be \nentitled to an injunction because they had not shown they were likely to suffer irreparable harm \nor that they lacked an adequate remedy at law.  Because he found that the Plaintiffs had not made \nthe threshold showings necessary for an injunction to issue, the Magistrate Judge found it \nunnecessary to engage in a balancing analysis.  Plaintiffs object to the Magistrate Judge’s \ndecision, and the parties have submitted briefs detailing their respective positions.   \n  While  the  objections  were  pending,  several  significant  developments  occurred, \nsubstantially narrowing the scope of the parties’ dispute.  First, Student A graduated from Fremd \nHigh School and the Locker Room Agreement pertaining to her was accordingly terminated.  \n[Dkt 185-1.]  Second, the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights and the \nUnited States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division withdrew the administrative guidance \nthat Plaintiffs had challenged in this action, and issued a joint guidance letter instructing that the \nviews conveyed in the earlier materials should not be relied upon while the issue is under further \nconsideration.  [Dkt 165-1.]  In light of the withdrawal of those materials, Plaintiffs voluntarily \ndismissed the Federal Defendants, thereby eliminating their Administrative Procedure Act claim, \nand  mooting  much  of  their  motion  and  objections  to  the  Magistrate  Judge’s  Report  and \nRecommendation.  [Dkt 178, 179.]   \nStandard of Review \n  When a party raises specific objections to a portion of a Magistrate Judge’s report and \nrecommendation, “[t]he district judge must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge’s \ndisposition that has been properly objected to.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).  “The district judge \nmay accept, reject, or modify the recommended disposition; receive further evidence; or return \nthe matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.”  Id.    \n4 \n \n\nDiscussion \nA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that is available only when the \nmovant shows clear need.  See Turnell v. Centimark Corp., 796 F. 3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2015).  \nA two-step inquiry applies when determining whether such relief is required.  Id.  First, the party \nseeking the preliminary injunction must make a threshold showing that: (1) absent preliminary \ninjunctive relief, it will suffer irreparable harm in the interim prior to a final resolution; (2) there \nis no adequate remedy at law; and (3) the party has a reasonable likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  See id. at 661–62.  If the movant makes the required threshold showing, then the court \nproceeds to a balancing analysis in which it considers: (4) the irreparable harm the moving party \nwill endure if the preliminary injunction is wrongfully denied versus the irreparable harm to the \nnonmoving party if it is wrongfully granted; and (5) the effects, if any, that the grant or denial of \nthe preliminary injunction would have on nonparties (the “public interest”).  See id. at 662.  “The \ncourt weighs the balance of potential harms on a ‘sliding scale’ against the movant’s likelihood \nof success: the more likely he is to win, the less the balance of harms must weigh in his favor; \nthe less likely he is to win, the more it must weigh in his favor.”   Id. at 662.   \n  Given the developments since the issuance of the Magistrate Judge’s opinion, only a \nportion  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  remain  at  issue.    Because  the  Federal  Defendants  have  been \ndismissed, Plaintiffs’ motion as to the federal rule embodied in the guidance documents is now \nmoot.  Likewise, because Student A has graduated and the Locker Room Agreement has been \nterminated, this aspect of Plaintiffs’ claims is also moot.  See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 \nU.S. 95, 102 (1984) (“Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or \ncontroversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continued, present adverse \neffects” (internal quotation omitted); Young v. Lane, 922 F.2d 370, 373-74 & n. 8 (plaintiffs \n5 \n \n\nrequest for injunctive relief on exercise of religion claim mooted by transfer from prison facility \nwhere challenged restrictions occurred).  Plaintiffs resist this result by pointing to Intervenor \nParent B’s declaration that Student B may want to use a District 211 locker room consistent with \nhis  gender  identity  [dkt  32-2],  and  a  recently  filed  charge  of  discrimination  brought  by  a \ntransgender student who was denied access to the locker room consistent with her gender identity \nat a District 211 school [dkt 186-1]. 2  The fact that other transgender students want or might \nwant to use sex-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity, however, neither \nsuggests  that  the  injury  of  which  Plaintiffs  complained  is  continuing  or  that  the  injury \ncomplained of will be repeated.  In any event, even if it could be said that Plaintiffs challenge to \nthe  Locker  Room  Agreement  remains  live,  the  Magistrate  Judge  correctly  determined  that \nPlaintiffs  had  not  shown  a  reasonable  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  that  allowing \ntransgender students access to sex-segregated facilities based on their gender identity violates \nTitle IX or the privacy rights of the Student Plaintiffs with whom such facilities are shared, \nwhether such facilities are restrooms or locker rooms.   \nWith certain exceptions, Title IX provides: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .  \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Because Title IX allows an educational institution to provide “separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” so long as they are “comparable to \nsuch facilities provided for students of the other sex,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, Plaintiffs say, a policy \nthat allows a transgender student access to sex-segregated facilities based on their gender identity \nimproperly hinders non-transgender students’ equal access under Title IX and burdens their \n                                                            \n2 Plaintiffs’ motion to supplement the record with this charge of discrimination [dkt 186] was \ntaken under advisement, and is hereby granted.   \n6 \n \n\nprivacy  rights  by  forcing  them  to  seek  privacy  protections  other  than  in  those  facilities.  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, District 211’s actions create a sexually hostile environment for Girl \nPlaintiffs and negatively impact their access to educational opportunities, benefits, programs, and \nschool activities because Girl Plaintiffs are scared, worried, or embarrassed about the possibility \nof being seen or heard by a transgender student while using the separate restrooms Title IX’s \nimplementing regulations specifically allow.  Plaintiffs assert that the Magistrate Judge erred in \nfinding the use of the term “sex” ambiguous in Title IX, thereby sanctioning an interpretation of \nsex that includes gender identity.  Plaintiffs heavily premised the arguments supporting their \nmotion and objections on Ulane v. Eastern Airlines Inc., 742 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1984), a \nSeventh  Circuit  decision  denying  a  cause  of  action  for  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \ntranssexualism upon a finding that Congress intended a narrow interpretation of the term “sex” in \nTitle VII.  [See dkt 23, 146.]  Embracing that rationale, Plaintiffs insist Title IX does not require \nthe provision of facilities consistent with a transgendered student’s gender identity, because \n“sex” means only the “binary, objectively verifiable” markers of a sexually reproducing species \ni.e., “our ‘privates.’”  [E.g., dkt 146 at 3-4.]    \n   As the Magistrate Judge correctly recognized, however, and as the Seventh Circuit has \nsince conclusively held, federal protections against sex discrimination are substantially broader \nthan based only on genitalia or chromosome.  In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 \n(1989), the Court held that discrimination based on sex stereotypes is cognizable under Title VII.  \nSee Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 242 (finding Title VII was “intended to strike at the entire \nspectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes”).  In Oncale \nv. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75 (1998), the Court reiterated an expansive \napproach to Title VII, declaring, “statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to \n7 \n \n\ncover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the \nprincipal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.”  Oncale, 523 U.S. 79 (finding \nTitle VII prohibits same-sex sexual harassment regardless of intent even though it was not the \nprincipal concern of Congress when it enacted the statute).   \nBased in part on these authorities, courts around the country have declined to follow the \nreasoning of Ulane in the three decades since its release.  See, e.g., Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d \n1312, 1317 & n. 5 (11th Cir. 2011) (noting Price Waterhouse eviscerated Ulane’s reasoning, and \nfinding “discrimination against a transgender individual because of her gender-nonconformity is \nsex discrimination”); Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 570 (6th Cir. 2004) (recognizing \ntransgender plaintiff’s sex-stereotyping claim since Price Waterhouse established Title VII’s \nreference to ‘sex’ “encompasses both the biological differences between men and women, and \ngender discrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical \ngender norms”); Rosa v. Park W. Bank & Trust Co., 214 F.3d 213 (1st Cir. 2000) (recognizing \nclaim under Equal Credit Opportunity Act based on sex-stereotyping); Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 \nF.3d 1187, 1199-1203 (9th Cir. 2000) (applying Price Waterhouse to recognize transsexual \nplaintiff’s Gender Motivated Violence Act claim).   \n  Moreover, while the objections were pending, the Seventh Circuit twice rejected the \nnarrow interpretation of “sex” that Plaintiffs forward here.  In Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. College \nof  Indiana,  853  F.3d  339  (7th  Cir.  2017)  (en  banc),  the  court  held  that  plaintiff  stated  a \n“paradigmatic sex discrimination” claim by alleging her employer had failed to promote her \nbecause she was a lesbian.  Id. at 345.  Applying Price Waterhouse and its progeny, the Seventh \nCircuit  reasoned,  “Any  discomfort,  disapproval  or  job  decision  based  on  the  fact  that  the \ncomplainant – woman or man – dresses differently, speaks differently, or dates or marries a same \n8 \n \n\nsex partner, is a reaction purely and simply based on sex.  That means it falls within Title VII’s \nprohibition against sex discrimination, if it affects employment in one of the specified ways.”  Id. \nat 347.   \n  In Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Education, 858 \nF.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017), the Seventh Circuit similarly applied a theory of sex stereotyping to \nfind that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination prohibits treating a transgender student \ndifferently than non-transgender students.  In Whitaker, a transgender student alleged that a \npolicy barring him from using the boys’ restroom after he started his female-to-male transition \nviolated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 1039.  \nThe District Court agreed, granting him injunctive relief, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  Id.  \nRejecting arguments similar to those forwarded by Plaintiffs here, the Seventh Circuit found that \na school policy that subjects a transgender student to different rules, sanctions, and treatment \nthan non-transgender students violates Title IX.   Id. at 1049-50.   \nThe Seventh Circuit made clear in Whitaker that its earlier decision in Ulane could not \n“foreclose . . . transgender students from bringing sex-discrimination claims based upon a theory \nof sex-stereotyping as articulated . . . in Price Waterhouse.”  Id. at 1047 (internal citation \nomitted).    Discrimination  against  transgender  individuals  is  sex  discrimination  under  Price \nWaterhouse, the Seventh Circuit explained, because “[b]y definition, a transgender individual \ndoes not conform to the sex-based stereotypes of the sex that he or she was assigned at birth.”   \nId. at 1048.  Following Price Waterhouse and its progeny, the Court reasoned that a “policy that \nrequires an individual to use a restroom that does not conform with his or her gender identity \npunishes that individual for his or her gender non-conformance which in turn violates Title IX.”  \nId. at 1049.  Providing a gender-neutral alternative was insufficient to relieve the school district \n9 \n \n\nfrom liability under Title IX, the Seventh Circuit explained, because it was “the policy itself \nwhich violates the Act.”   Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1050.   \n  Although the arguments considered in Whitaker mirror those made by Plaintiffs here, \nPlaintiffs  try  to  distinguish  Whitaker  as  only  “superficially  similar”  since  it  only  involved \nrestroom access, and insist that the decision is so “astonishingly wrong” that its reasoning \nundercuts its “worth even as persuasive authority.”  [Dkt 180 at 5, 16, 19.]  Even if locker room \naccess were still a live issue, however, it provides no logical basis to so distinguish Whitaker’s \nrule.  Nothing in the Seventh Circuit’s analysis suggests that restrooms and locker rooms should \nbe treated differently under Title IX or that the presence of a transgendered student in either, \nespecially given additional privacy protections like single stalls or privacy screens, implicates the \nconstitutional privacy rights of others with whom such facilities are shared.  Plaintiffs’ critiques \nnotwithstanding, Whitaker reflects a straightforward application of the long-standing line of sex \nstereotyping decisions, fully in line with the Supreme Court’s guidance on sex discrimination \nclaims.   \n  The  fact  that  Plaintiffs  premised  their  action  in  part  on  certain  Student  Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaints about the District’s policy whereas in Whitaker the school district defended their \npolicy on similar privacy claims on behalf of non-party students also does not distinguish the \ncases.  This is clear from Plaintiffs’ continued assertion of the arguments rejected in Whitaker, \nand their attacks on the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning.  [See dkt 180 (calling the school district’s \ndefense of its policy “proper,” and “sound,” and the Seventh Circuit’s decision replete with \n“numerous  errors”  rendering  it  “incorrect  as  a  matter  of  law”).]    Plaintiffs’  challenge \nnotwithstanding, Whitaker nevertheless controls and confirms that the Magistrate Judge was \ncorrect in his assessment of Plaintiffs’ Title IX claim.  See Reiser v. Residential Funding Corp., \n10 \n \n\n380 F.3d 1027, 1029 (7th Cir. 2004) (“In a hierarchical system, decisions of a superior court are \nauthoritative on inferior courts.”)   \n  The Seventh Circuit’s decision in Whitaker also makes clear that the Magistrate Judge \ncorrectly  determined  that  Plaintiffs  had  not  established  a  likelihood  of  success  on  their \nconstitutional privacy claim.  Although initially framed even more broadly, Plaintiffs ultimately \nposed their privacy claim on the motion as whether “letting a biological male use the girls’ \nlocker room and restrooms, and so subjecting Girl Plaintiffs to the risk of compelled exposure of \ntheir bodies to the opposite biological sex, violate Girl Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy?”  \n[Dkt 50 at 6.]  While the Supreme Court has not recognized a generalized right to privacy, it has \nextended substantive due process protection of privacy interests in certain limited circumstances.  \nSee, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 577-78 (2003) (recognizing individual decisions \nabout physical intimacy are a form of liberty protected by Due Process Clause of Fourteenth \nAmendment); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153 (1973) (right to privacy “found in the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s concept of personal liberty . . . is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision \nwhether or not to terminate her pregnancy”).  The Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit have \nboth cautioned that “the scope of substantive due process is very limited.”  Belcher v. Nelson, \n497 F.3d 742, 753 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing Washington v. Glucksburg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997)).    \n In a substantive due process analysis, the court requires a careful description of the \nasserted interest at issue.  See Christensen v. Cnty of Boone, 483 F.3d 454, 462 (7th Cir. 2007).   \nIt must then be determined whether the asserted interest is “fundamental,” or whether “it is so \ndeeply rooted and sacrosanct that no amount of process would justify its deprivation.”  Id. at 462.  \nFinding  that  Plaintiffs’  formulation  of  the  issue  overstated  the  actual  interest  they  seek  to \nvindicate, the Magistrate Judge more narrowly framed the issue as whether “high school students \n11 \n \n\nhave a constitutional right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender students \nwhose sex assigned at birth is different from theirs?”  [Dkt 134 at 45.]   \n  Plaintiffs’ objection to this formulation as having ignored the privacy implications of \n“comingling the sexes” and their insistence that giving a transgender student access to the \nrestrooms of the sex with which she or he identifies serves only to “affirm” a transgender \nstudent’s perception of himself, while violating Student Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy, \nflies in the face of Whitaker.   The school district in Whitaker unsuccessfully defended its policy \nwith the same argument as Plaintiffs advance here, i.e., that allowing transgender students access \nto restrooms based on their gender identity infringes on the privacy rights of other students with \nwhom they do not share biological anatomy.  [Dkt 180 at 1 (discussing Whitaker, 858 F.3d at \n1052).]  The Court here is similarly unpersuaded.  This case does not involve the forced or \nextreme invasions of privacy that the courts addressed in the cases cited by Plaintiffs.  Further, \nthe restrooms at issue here have privacy stalls that can be used by students seeking an additional \nlayer of privacy, and single-use facilities are also available upon request.  [Dkt 78-1.]   Given \nthese protections, there is no meaningful risk that a student’s unclothed body need be seen by \nany other person.  \n  Further,  Plaintiffs’  assumption  that  the  development  of  additional  facts  in  Whitaker \nwould have changed its outcome is belied by the rationale of the Seventh Circuit’s decision.  \nThere is no suggestion in Whitaker that undeveloped facts were outcome-determinative.  Rather, \nthe Court rejected as unsound parallel privacy arguments as those asserted here, observing: \nA transgender student’s presence in the restroom provides no more of a risk to \nother students’ privacy rights than the presence of an overly curious student of the \nsame  biological  sex  who  decides  to  sneak  glances  at  his  or  her  classmates \nperforming bodily functions.  Or for that matter, any other student who uses the \nbathroom at the same time.  Common sense tells us that the communal restroom is \n12 \n \n\na place where individuals act in a discreet manner to protect their privacy and \nthose who have true privacy concerns are able to utilize a stall. \n \n858 F.3d at 1052.  Further, their current argument notwithstanding, Plaintiffs made clear that \ntheir challenge to District 211’s policy was not based on any individual complaints but was \ninstead a facial one.  As Plaintiffs put it in resisting the District’s efforts to obtain discovery and \nas they repeat despite their argument in their most recent briefs, Plaintiffs frame the issue in this \naction as whether “the District 211 Defendants’ official, intentional intermingling of the sexes \nwithin privacy facilities violates the constitutional right to bodily privacy and provisions of Title \nIX.”  [Dkt 185 at 6.]      \n  Similarly unpersuasive is Plaintiffs’ emphasis on the dissent’s reasoning in the Fourth \nCircuit’s G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., a decision regarding a transgender \nstudent’s access to sex-segregated facilities and the fact that the Supreme Court recalled the \nmandate and stayed an injunction there pending the filing and disposition of a writ of certiorari.  \nSee G.G. ex rel. Grimm, 822 F.3d 709 (4th Cir. 2006), mandate recalled and stayed, Gloucester \nCty. Sch. Bd. v. G.G. ex rel. Grimm, 136 S. Ct. 2442 (2016), cert. granted, No. 16-273 (Oct. 28, \n2016).  Whitaker is binding on this Court, and the stay in G.G. only preserved the status quo.  It \ndoes not create a privacy right of the nature that Plaintiffs assert.   \n  At the time the Magistrate Judge rendered his decision, the law in the Seventh Circuit \nwas in flux.  Plaintiffs’ protestations notwithstanding, it is now clear, and binding.  See Reiser, \n380 F.3d 1029; Matter of Skupniewitz, 73 F.3d 702, 705 (7th Cir. 1996).  For the reasons \ndiscussed  by  the  Magistrate  Judge  and  herein,  Plaintiffs  have  not  carried  their  burden  of \nestablishing a reasonable likelihood of success on either their Title IX or their constitutional \nprivacy claims.   \n13 \n \n\n  Further, even if Plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits, they would \nstill not be entitled to a preliminary injunction because they have not shown they are likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, or that they lack an adequate remedy at \nlaw in the event that they ultimately succeed on their claims.  Both before the Magistrate Judge \nand in their objections, Plaintiffs argue that irreparable harm may be presumed if they establish a \nlikelihood of success on their constitutional claim, and that they will suffer such harm if they are \ndenied access to “truly private girls’ locker rooms and bathrooms.”  [Dkt 23 at 35, 146 at 36.]  \nBut Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success either on their constitutional privacy or \ntheir Title IX claims, and the only specific harm to which they point is the risk of running late to \nclass  by  using  alternate  restrooms  to  avoid  sharing  with  a  transgender  student  and  the \n“embarrassment,  humiliation,  anxiety,  fear,  apprehension,  stress,  degradation,  and  loss  of \ndignity” allegedly felt by Student Plaintiffs arising from such sharing.  [Dkt 1 ¶ 11.]  As the \nMagistrate Judge correctly found, the mere inconvenience of using remote facilities does not \nconstitute irreparable harm, the risk of being late to class has not been shown to have any \nmeaningful  impact  on  Student  Plaintiffs’  education,  and  the  emotional  damages  of  which \nPlaintiffs complain are commonly compensated by monetary awards.  See Bhd. of Locomotive \nEngineers & Trainmen v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., No. No. 10 C 8296, 2011 WL 221823 at *5 \n(N.D. Ill. Jan. 21, 2011).   \nNotably, District 211’s practice of allowing transgender students to use the restrooms of \nthe gender with which they identify was implemented nearly three years before the filing of this \naction.    As  the  Magistrate  Judge  observed,  either  Student  Plaintiffs  did  not  notice  that \ntransgender students were using restrooms consistent with their gender identity, or they knew \nand tolerated it for several years.  The passage of time therefore further undermines Plaintiffs’ \n14 \n \n\nclaim of irreparable harm.  This Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge’s assessment, “[t]here is \nno indication that anything has negatively impacted Girl Plaintiffs’ education.”  [Dkt 134 at 76.]     \nBecause the Magistrate Judge correctly found that Plaintiffs had not made any of the \nthreshold showing required for a preliminary injunction to issue, Plaintiffs’ objections to the \nReport and Recommendation are overruled, and their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is \ndenied.   \nCONCLUSION \n  For all of the above mentioned reasons Plaintiffs’ objections [146] to the Report and \nRecommendation  of  the  Magistrate  Judge  [134]  are  overruled  and  the  Report  and \nRecommendation is adopted.  Plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [21] is denied.  \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to Supplement the Record [186] is granted.  Defendants shall \nanswer or otherwise respond to Plaintiffs’ complaint by January 30, 2018.

District 211 and intervenor-\ndefendants move to dismiss.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies \nin part the motions to dismiss. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \n  The following facts are from plaintiffs’ complaint, and the Court takes them as true.1  \nPlaintiffs Students and Parents for Privacy (“SPP”) is a voluntary, unincorporated association of: \n                                                      \n1 As lawyers understand, on a motion to dismiss, a Court accepts alleged facts as true.  That does \nnot mean the facts are true; that does not mean a plaintiff will ultimately be able to prove the \n\n(1) students who are (or will be) attending District 211 high schools; and (2) their parents.  Some \nSPP Students are as young as 14 years.  Plaintiff Victoria Wilson (“Wilson”) is the president of \nSPP and the mother of two students in District 211 schools.  Intervenor Illinois Safe Schools \nAlliance is an organization that advocates on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and \nquestioning young people.  Intervenor Student A is a graduate of District 211’s Fremd High \nSchool, and Intervenor Students B and C are current students of a District 211 high school.  \nStudents A, B and C claim genders different from their sex at birth.  For example, Student A is a \nmale student with a feminine gender.   \n  Plaintiffs allege that the words sex and gender mean different things.  One’s sex is either \nmale or female, depending on the union of male and female gametes at one’s conception.  \nGender, on the other hand, is a social construct and runs along a continuum from very masculine \nto very feminine.  Plaintiffs allege that a person’s perception of his or her own gender does not \nchange his or her primary or secondary sex characteristics or his or her genes. \n  The crux of this suit is that defendants seek to affirm the claimed genders of students by \nallowing male students who claim female gender to use privacy facilities (i.e., bathrooms and \nlocker rooms) designated for use by the female sex and female students who claim male gender \nto use privacy facilities designated for the male sex.  Plaintiffs refer to the policy as District \n211’s “compelled affirmation policy.”  Plaintiffs allege District 211 did not adopt the policy \nbased on students’ manifesting behaviors or appearances stereotypical of genders different from \ntheir own.  Rather, District 211 adopted the policy solely to affirm the claimed genders of those \nstudents claiming a gender different from their sex at birth.   \n                                                      \nfacts.  Many a plaintiff has failed to prove, at a subsequent stage of litigation, the facts alleged in \na complaint.  Plaintiffs, however, are, within the bounds of Rule 11, the masters of their \ncomplaint; and, the Court takes the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint as true. \n  2 \n\n  District 211’s enforcement of the compelled affirmation policy has caused SPP Students \nembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation and loss of dignity.  \nSPP Students are at continual risk of encountering (and sometimes do encounter), without their \nconsent, members of the opposite sex while disrobing, showering, urinating, defecating and \nwhile changing tampons and feminine napkins.  When District 211 first allowed Student A to use \nfemale restrooms, SPP Girls were startled, shocked, embarrassed and frightened by the presence \nof a male in the girls’ restroom.   \n  At some point after District 211 first allowed Student A to use the girls’ restrooms but \nbefore it allowed her to use the girls’ locker rooms, Student A used a girls’ locker room anyway.  \nA female student (who is not a plaintiff but who had been sexually assaulted previously) was \nexposed to Student A’s penis.  District 211 failed to investigate or remediate the situation.  \nInstead, by December 2015, District 211 allowed Student A to access the girls’ locker rooms.  At \nfirst, the policy applied only to Student A, who was required to change in private changing \nstations while in the girls’ locker rooms.  On one or more occasions, Student A failed to use a \nprivate changing station while changing.  The reason District 211 allowed Student A to use the \ngirls’ locker rooms is because it was used by females.  Had the girls’ locker rooms not been \nlimited to females, District 211 would not have been able to affirm Student A’s gender by \nallowing her also to use the girls’ locker rooms. \n  After District 211 allowed Student A to use the girls’ locker rooms, an SPP Parent \nrequested that her daughter be allowed to use a private locker room.  The district refused. \n  Eventually, District 211 adopted the compelled affirmation policy allowing all \ntransgender students to use the restrooms and locker rooms (including showers) of their choice.  \nAll other students must use the restrooms and locker rooms designated for their sex.  Before \n  3 \n\nadopting the policy, District 211 did not investigate the reliability of the science underlying \ngender-affirmation treatments.  Nor did it make any effort to understand the impacts such a \npolicy would have on students exposed to opposite-sex, same-gendered students in locker rooms \nand restrooms.   \n  Under the compelled affirmation policy, District 211 allows students to use the restroom \nand locker room facilities of their choice, regardless of how each student presents or whether the \nstudent manifests behaviors or characteristics stereotypical of his or her claimed gender.  \nAffirming each students’ gender under the policy requires the participation of third parties, \nincluding SPP Students, who are directed to enforce or conform to the District’s actions.  District \n211 has conveyed to students that when a person objects to the compelled affirmation policy, the \nperson is intolerant and bigoted.  District 211 has told SPP Students that if they are \nuncomfortable using a restroom or locker room, they should leave.  Currently, District 211 has \nmale students claiming feminine gender and female students claiming masculine gender.  At \nleast one of these students has been allowed to use locker rooms without using privacy stations.  \nDistrict 211 also has students claiming to be non-binary and genderless. \n  District 211 students are required to take physical education (“PE”).  Female students \nchanging for PE and sports are sometimes topless in locker rooms.  Students changing for \nswimming are sometimes naked.  Few SPP Students have requested use of a private locker room, \nlest District 211 view them as bigoted.  Use of a bathroom stall for changing is not a good \nalternative, because such stalls are cramped and less sanitary than a locker room.  Thus, SPP \nGirls and SPP Boys have been denied their allegedly reasonable expectation of privacy while \nusing locker rooms.  They have been denied their expectation of privacy in restrooms, as well, \nbecause gaps in stall doors allow exposure to the opposite sex.   \n  4 \n\n  Plaintiffs allege that SPP Students risk and suffer actual exposure to the opposite sex, \nwhich causes them embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation \nand loss of dignity.  The compelled affirmation policy has caused SPP Students to change their \nbehavior to avoid the risk of exposure.  For example, one SPP Girl began wearing gym clothes \nunderneath her school clothes to avoid getting undressed in locker rooms.  As a result, she wears \nsoiled, sweaty gym clothes under her school clothes for the rest of the school day.  One SPP Girl \nused a private changing stall in the girls’ locker room, after which other girls began calling her \n“transphobic” and “homophobic.”  That SPP Girl has also been called slang words for female \nbody parts.  The taunts deterred the SPP Girl from using changing stalls.  The swim and \ngymnastics locker rooms do not have private changing stalls.  Student A, while she was a student \nat District 211’s Fremd High School, was authorized to use the swim locker room at any time.  \nMany SPP Girls shower after swim class in open showers that are visible to other students in the \nlocker room.  One SPP Girl is enrolled in swim class (which is mandatory for freshmen and \nsophomores), and she is fearful, uncomfortable and apprehensive about changing for swim class.  \n  The compelled affirmation policy also has caused SPP Students to change their behavior \nwith respect to their use of restrooms.  After repeatedly encountering Student A in restrooms, \nsome SPP Girls used the restroom as infrequently as possible, putting themselves at risk of \nurinary tract infections, dehydration and constipation.  Some SPP Girls used the restroom during \nclass time to reduce the risk of encountering a member of the opposite sex in a restroom.  Thus, \nthose students lose instructional time in class. \n  Based on these allegations, plaintiffs seek relief for alleged violations of Title IX (Count \nI), the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n(Count II), the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children (Count III), \n  5 \n\nthe Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Count IV) and the right to free exercise of \nreligion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (Count V).  Defendants \nmove to dismiss. \nII.  STANDARD ON A MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true the factual allegations in the \ncomplaint and draws permissible inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Boucher v. Finance Syst. of \nGreen Bay, Inc., 880 F.3d 362, 365 (7th Cir. 2018).  The Court may dismiss a claim pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the plaintiff fails “to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  Under the notice-pleading requirements of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must “give the defendant fair notice of what \nthe . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).  Thus, a motion to dismiss \ntests whether a plaintiff has given sufficient notice of a claim, not whether plaintiff will \nultimately prevail.  A complaint need not provide detailed factual allegations, but mere \nconclusions and a “formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action” will generally not \nsuffice.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  To survive a motion to dismiss, a claim must be plausible.  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009).  Allegations that are as consistent with lawful conduct as \nthey are with unlawful conduct are not sufficient; rather, plaintiffs must include allegations that \n“nudg[e] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.  \n \n \n \n  \n  6 \n\nIII.  DISCUSSION \n \n  A  Standing \n  District 211 (though not the intervenors) argues that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue this \nsuit.  The Constitution limits a federal court’s jurisdiction to cases and controversies, and “the \nirreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.”  Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-60 (1992).  Thus, a plaintiff must have “(1) suffered an injury in fact, \n(2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be \nredressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, __ U.S. __, 136 S.Ct. 1540, \n1547 (2016).  A plaintiff must establish standing “with the manner and degree of evidence \nrequired at the successive stages of the litigation.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  Thus, here, at the \npleading stage, allegations will suffice. \n  As the Supreme Court has explained, an association “has standing to bring suit on behalf \nof its members when: \n(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of \nindividual members in the lawsuit. \n \nHunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n., 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977); see also Keep \nChi. Livable v. City of Chi., 913 F.3d 618, 625 (7th Cir. 2019).  As to the second prong, in Hunt, \nthe Supreme Court noted: \nIf in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other \nform of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the remedy, if \ngranted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually \ninjured. \n \nHunt, 432 U.S. at 343 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515 (1975)).   \n  7 \n\n  Those first two prongs “arise from Article III,” but the “third prong is prudential,” which \nis to say it is a matter of “administrative convenience and efficiency.”  Milwaukee Police Assoc. \nv. Flynn, 863 F.3d 636, 640 (7th Cir. 2017).  With respect to the third prong, in Hunt, the \nSupreme Court quoted Warth v. Seldin, where the Supreme Court said, “so long as the nature of \nthe claim and of the relief sought does not make the individual participation of each injured party \nindispensable to proper resolution of the case, the association may be an appropriate \nrepresentative.”  Hunt, 432 U.S. at 342-43 (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 511 (emphasis added)); \nsee also Retired Chi. Police Assoc. of Chi. v. City of Chi., 7 F.3d 584, 602-603 (7th Cir. 1993) \n(“Th[e] evidence might be supplied by some of the members.  Each [member’s] presence as a \nparty would not be required.”).   \n    1.  SPP \n  District 211 argues that SPP does not have associational standing to sue on behalf of its \nmembers.  The Court disagrees.  District 211 first argues that SPP lacks associational standing, \nbecause it has not named any individual members.  It need not do so.  Disability Rights of Wisc., \nInc. v. Walworth Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 522 F.3d 796, 802 (7th Cir. 2008) (Associational \nstanding “allows for the members on whose behalf the suit is filed to remain unnamed by the \norganization.”).  District 211 also argues that plaintiffs “make no allegations as to the number of \n‘SPP Students’ who share the viewpoints of SPP, which makes their allegations even more \ndeficient for standing purposes.”  (District 211’s Reply Brief/Docket 212 at 3 n. 1).  The Court \ndisagrees.  Federal courts have a long history of considering (and protecting) the rights of \nminorities, even those who hold views that the majority of society considers politically incorrect. \nNeither the number of injured parties nor the magnitude of the injury has any bearing on whether \na case is justiciable.  Sierra Club v. Franklin Cty. Power of Ill., LLC, 546 F.3d 918, 925 (7th Cir. \n  8 \n\n2008) (“The defendants claim that [plaintiff’s] injury is insubstantial, but the ‘injury-in-fact \nnecessary for standing ‘need not be large, an identifiable trifle will suffice.’”) (quoting LaFleur \nv. Whitman, 300 F.3d 256, 270-71 (2d Cir. 2002)); ACLU v. City of St. Charles, 794 F.2d 265, \n269 (7th Cir. 1986) (“one plaintiff is all that is needed to enable the suit to be maintained”). \n  What matters is whether SPP alleges that at least one of its members was injured.  It has.  \nPlaintiffs allege SPP Girls have been startled, shocked, embarrassed and frightened by the \npresence of Student A in the girls’ restroom.  These types of injuries are sufficient to establish \nstanding.  See Nixon v. Warner Comm., Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 599 n. 11 (1978) (“his allegations of \nfurther embarrassment . . . establish injury in fact”); Kindle v. Fifth Third Bank, Case No. 14-cv-\n6502, 2015 WL 5159890 at * 2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 1, 2015) (“Plaintiff alleges that Defendant caused \nhim to soil himself in public, resulting in pain and suffering, humiliation, alienation, and \nemotional distress.  These alleged injuries are specific to Plaintiff and are sufficient to establish \ninjury in fact.”); Hizer v. Pulaski Cty., Ind., Case No. 3:16-cv-885-JD-MGG, 2017 WL 3977004 \nat *3 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 11, 2017) (embarrassment and burden of having to use inaccessible \nrestrooms was injury in fact that supported standing).  Plaintiffs also allege that the compelled \naffirmation policy puts SPP Students at risk of exposure to the opposite sex, which causes them \nembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation and loss of dignity.  \nDistrict 211 argues that some of the injury is merely threatened, but “threatened injury can \nsatisfy Article III standing requirements.”  Sierra Club, 546 F.3d at 926.  In any case, plaintiffs \nhave alleged that the compelled affirmation policy has caused SPP Students to change their \nbehavior:  one SPP Girl wears her gym clothes under her school clothes (which means she walks \naround all day in sweaty, dirty gym clothes); some SPP Girls used restrooms as infrequently as \npossible (which put them at risk of urinary tract infections, dehydration and constipation); and \n  9 \n\nsome SPP Girls use the restroom during class periods (which means they miss instructional \ntime).  These are injuries in fact.  See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental \nServices, Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 183-184 (2000) (“we see nothing ‘improbable’ about the \nproposition that [defendant’s discharge of] pollutants into a river would cause nearby residents to \ncurtail their recreational use of that waterway . . . and that is enough for injury in fact”); Sierra \nClub, 546 F.3d at 925-26 (“[I]f [plaintiff] foregoes her regular visits to the lake because of these \npollutants, that would also constitute injury-in-fact.”). \n  Finally, District 211 argues that SPP’s claims cannot proceed under associational \nstanding, because the nature of the claims is such that individual members will need to testify.  \nThe Court disagrees.  Although it is true that SPP will likely need the testimony of some of its \nmembers to establish its claims, the question is whether it will need the participation of every \nmember.  Hunt, 432 U.S. at 342-43 (“so long as the nature of the claim and of the relief sought \ndoes not make the individual participation of each injured party indispensable to proper \nresolution of the case, the association may be an appropriate representative”) (quoting Warth, \n422 U.S. at 511 (emphasis added)); see also Retired Chi. Police, 7 F.3d at 603 (“Th[e] evidence \nmight be supplied by some of the members.  Each [member’s] presence as a party would not be \nrequired.”).  It is not clear that plaintiff would need the testimony of every member.  \nAccordingly, District 211 has not convinced the Court that this prudential rule should keep this \ncase out of federal court.  SPP has adequately alleged that it has standing, and District 211’s \nmotion to dismiss is denied as to this issue.  \n    2.  Victoria Wilson \n  District 211 also argues that plaintiff Wilson lacks standing.  Wilson’s response consists \nof one sentence and cites to Count III.  (SPP Brief/Docket 211 at 29) (“She does have standing in \n  10 \n\nher individual capacity as a parent.”).  Count III seeks relief based on the parents’ right to direct \nthe education of their children.   \n  The Court agrees that parents generally have standing to pursue such claims, \nFleishfresser v. Directors of School District 200, 15 F.3d 680, 684 (7th Cir. 1994), and that SPP \nhas standing to bring the claim on behalf of SPP Parents.  The first amended complaint alleges \ninjury to at least one SPP Parent who sent his child to private school and others who were denied \nprivate locker rooms for their children (First Am. Complt./Docket 197 at ¶¶ 279, 284), not to \nmention the injuries to the SPP Students themselves.  The first amended complaint, however, \nincludes no allegations of an injury to Victoria Wilson particularly or to her children particularly.  \nAccordingly, the Court agrees with District 211 that plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that \nplaintiff Victoria Wilson has standing.  Accordingly, District 211’s motion to dismiss is granted \nas to her claims.  Victoria Wilson’s claims are dismissed without prejudice.  \n  B.  Title IX \n  In Count I, SPP asserts that SPP Students were subjected to harassment in violation of \nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  Under that statute, “No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance[.]”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  As is true under Title VII, the Supreme Court has \nfound a private right of action for sexual harassment under Title IX.  Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of \nEd., 526 U.S. 629 (1999).  A school district may be liable for sexual harassment if the district \nwas “deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which they have actual knowledge, that is \nso severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access \nto the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.”  Davis, 526 U.S. at 650; see \n  11 \n\nalso Trentadue v. Redmon, 619 F.3d 648, 654 (7th Cir. 2010).  District 211 and intervenors argue \nthat plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim.  They dispute, among other \nthings, whether what SPP alleges is sufficiently severe, pervasive and objectively unreasonable. \n  SPP has alleged that SPP Students have been subjected to sexual harassment due to the \ncompelled affirmation policy.  Were this a case of sexual harassment in employment brought \nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, such allegations would be enough to put \ndefendant on notice of the claim and to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  Tate v. \nSCR Medical Transp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015).  In Tate, the Seventh Circuit reversed \ndismissal for failure to state a claim of a complaint in which the plaintiff alleged, “[d]uring my \nemployment, I was subjected to sexual harassment.  I complained to no avail.”  Tate, 809 F.3d at \n345-346.  The Seventh Circuit said the sexual harassment claim was “adequately alleged,” \nbecause “to prevent dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint alleging sex discrimination need \nonly aver that the employer [had] instituted a (specified) adverse employment action against the \nplaintiff on the basis of her [or his] sex.’”  Tate, 809 F.3d at 346 (quoting Tamayo v. Blagojevich, \n526 F.3d 1074, 1084-85 (7th Cir. 2008)).  Count I, however, is a claim under Title IX rather than \nTitle VII. \n  Title IX claims have similarities to Title VII claims, and the Seventh Circuit “has looked \nto Title VII when construing Title IX.”  Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School Dist. No. 1 Bd. of \nEd., 858 F.3d 1034, 1047 (7th Cir. 2017).  Claims under Title IX are even more similar to claims \nunder Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Basically, Title VI is to race, color and national \norigin what Title IX is to sex.  See Doe v. Galster, 768 F.3d 611, 617 (7th Cir. 2014) (“Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972 makes the same guarantee [as Title VI] but substitutes \n‘on the basis of sex’ for ‘on the ground of race, color, or national origin.’”).  Thus, the Seventh \n  12 \n\nCircuit has said, “Title VI and Title IX are so similar that a decision interpreting one generally \napplies to the other.”  Galster, 768 F.3d at 617.  As is true of claims under Title VII, the Seventh \nCircuit has emphasized in a Title VI case that “there is no heightened pleading requirement in \nRule 8 for discrimination cases.”  Su v. Eastern Ill. Univ., 565 Fed.Appx. 520, 521-22 (7th Cir. \n2014) (reversing decision to dismiss Title VI claim for failure to allege “actual knowledge of the \ndiscrimination” or that defendant “had the authority to address the discrimination”).   \n  The Court concludes that the standards for pleading discrimination (including \nharassment) described in Tate, Tamayo and Su apply equally to the Title IX claim asserted here.  \nSPP has pleaded far more than is necessary under Tate to state a claim for sexual harassment.  \nWhether SPP can ultimately prevail on this claim is a question for another day, but the \nallegations in the complaint suffice to put District 211 on notice.  Accordingly, the motions to \ndismiss are denied as to Count I. \n  C.  Right to bodily privacy \n  In Count II, SPP asserts that SPP Students have a fundamental right to bodily privacy that \nprotects their partially- or fully-unclothed bodies.  They assert that this right includes a right to \nbe free from government-enforced, unconsented risk of exposure to the opposite sex when they \nor members of the opposite sex are partially or fully unclothed.  \n  Because this right is not explicitly found in the Constitution, it must be located, if at all, \nin the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  On that subject, the \nSupreme Court has explained: \nThe Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the ‘liberty’ it \nprotects includes more than the absence of physical restraint.  The Clause also \nprovides heightened protection against government interference with certain \nfundamental rights and liberty interests.  In a long line of cases, we have held that, \nin addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the ‘liberty’ \nspecially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the rights to marry, to \n  13 \n\nhave children, to direct the education and upbringing of one’s children, to marital \nprivacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. \n165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952); and to abortion.  We have also assumed, \nand strongly suggested, that the Due Process Clause protects the traditional right \nto refuse unwanted medical treatment. \n \nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719-20 (1997) (most internal citations omitted).  The \nSupreme Court has since recognized the right to same-sex marriage.  Obergefell v. Hodges, __ \nU.S. __, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015). \n  In Glucksberg, the Supreme Court went on say: \nBut, we ‘ha[ve] always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due \nprocess because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered \narea are scarce and open-ended.’  By extending constitutional protection to an \nasserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the \narena of public debate and legislative action.  We must therefore, ‘exercise the \nutmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,’ lest the \nliberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy \npreferences of the Members of this Court.  \n \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720.  In a sense, that makes this Court’s job easier, as the Seventh \nCircuit has explained: \n[Plaintiff] also asserts that [defendant] violated her rights to substantive due \nprocess.  We can quickly dispose of this argument.  . . . The list of [substantive \ndue process] rights and interests is, however, a short one, including things like the \nright to marry, the right to have children, the right to marital privacy, the right to \ncontraception, and the right to bodily integrity.  Conspicuously missing on this list \nis the right to follow any particular career.  Indeed, no court could recognize such \na right without acting in the teeth of the many cautions that the Supreme Court \nhas given against expanding the concept of substantive due process[.] \n \nPark v. Indiana Univ. School of Dentistry, 692 F.3d 828, 832 (7th Cir. 2012) (internal citations \nomitted). \n  So far, the right not to be seen unclothed by the opposite sex is not on the Supreme \nCourt’s list.  By bodily integrity, the Supreme Court was talking about physical bodily integrity, \nnot visual bodily privacy.  Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952) (a “struggle to open \n  14 \n\n[plaintiff’s] mouth and remove what was there” as well as “the forcible extraction of his \nstomach’s contents” constituted a violation of his substantive due process rights).  That is why \nCanedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183 (7th Cir. 1994), does not help plaintiff.  There, the plaintiff’s \nallegation that he was strip searched “by female guards, and that no effort has been made to \naccommodate his privacy interests” stated a claim for violation of bodily integrity.  Canedy, 16 \nF.3d at 188.  That, though, was a “tactile” search, as the Seventh Circuit later described it when \ndistinguishing Canedy from a visual search.  Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 145 (7th Cir. 1995) \n(Canedy “holds that a right of privacy limits the ability of wardens to subject men to body \nsearches by women, or the reverse.  Our case involves visual rather than tactile inspections[.]”). \n  On a number of occasions, the Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit have discussed \nbodily privacy in the context of rights under other amendments.  See Vernonia School Dist. 47J \nv. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 657 (1995) (“For their own good and that of their classmates, public \nschool children are routinely required to submit to various physical examinations, and to be \nvaccinated against various diseases.  . . .  Legitimate privacy expectations are even less with \nregard to student athletes.  School sports are not for the bashful.  They require ‘suiting up’ before \neach practice or event, and showering and changing afterwards.  Public school locker rooms, the \nusual sites for these activities, are not notable for the privacy they afford.”) (holding that \nmandatory urine-testing for drugs did not violate the Fourth Amendment); Johnson, 69 F.3d at \n148 & 150 (“How odd it would be to find in the eighth amendment a right not to be seen by the \nother sex.  Physicians and nurses of one sex routinely examine the other.  In exotic places such as \nCalifornia people regularly sit in saunas and hot tubs with unclothed strangers.”) (Holding “[t]he \nfourth amendment does not protect privacy interests within prisons.  Moving to other \namendments does not change the outcome.”); Id. at 152 (“The nudity taboo retains great strength \n  15 \n\nin the United States.  . . .  Ours is a morally diverse populace and the nudity taboo is not of \nuniform strength across it.  It is strongest among professing Christians, because of the historical \nantipathy of the Church to nudity . . .  The taboo is particularly strong when the stranger belongs \nto the opposite sex.”) (Posner, J., concurring); Cornfield v. Consolidated High School Dist. No. \n230, 991 F.2d 1316, 1321 & 1323 (7th Cir. 1993) (“no one would seriously dispute that a nude \nsearch of a child is traumatic”) (holding strip search of high school student was not unreasonable \nsearch); Schaill v. Tippecanoe Cty. School Corp., 864 F.2d 1309, 1312 & 1313 (7th Cir. 1988) \n(“There can be little doubt that a person engaging in the act of urination possesses a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy as to that act, and as to the urine which is excreted.  In our society, it is \nexpected that urination be performed in private, that urine be disposed of in private and that the \nact, if mentioned at all, be described in euphemistic terms.”) (holding that urine drug test \nconstitutes search).  While these cases recognize some level of societal appreciation for adult \nprivacy (though less so for students) in urination and in being naked in front of the opposite sex, \nnone of these cases compels a conclusion that the right SPP asserts in this case is within the \nbounds of substantive due process; nor do they synthesize to support a substantive due process \nright. \n  In any case, this Court takes seriously the cautions of the superior courts not to expand \nsubstantive due process.  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720 (“[W]e ‘have always been reluctant to \nexpand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible \ndecisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and open-ended.’”) (quoting Collins v. Harker \nHeights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)); Park, 692 F.3d at 832 (“Indeed, no court could recognize \nsuch a right without acting in the teeth of the many cautions that the Supreme Court has given \nagainst expanding the concept of substantive due process[.]”) (internal citations omitted).  \n  16 \n\nAlthough it would not shock the Court if the Seventh Circuit or Supreme Court one day \nrecognizes the right to bodily privacy that the plaintiff seeks to enforce,2 this Court is not at \nliberty to expand the substantive rights protected by the Due Process Clause.  \n  Accordingly, Count II fails to state a claim.  Defendants’ motions to dismiss are granted \nas to Count II, and Count II is dismissed with prejudice.    \n  D.   Right to direct the education of their children \n  In Count III, on behalf of the SPP Parents, plaintiff SPP asserts a claim for infringement \nof SPP Parents’ right to direct the education of their children.  They argue that the right to direct \nthe education of their children encompasses a right to determine whether their children will be \nexposed to opposite-sex children in restrooms and locker rooms.  The Court does not agree that \nthe right can be stretched that far. \n  The right to direct the education of one’s child traces back to the 1920s, when, relying on \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court, in Meyer v. \nNebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), declared unconstitutional a state statute prohibiting the teaching \nof modern foreign language to students who had not yet passed the eighth grade and, in Pierce v. \nSociety of the Sisters of Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), affirmed an \ninjunction against enforcement of compulsory public education.  In Pierce, the Supreme Court \nexplained: \n                                                      \n2 Indeed, the Third Circuit has recognized such a right.  Doe v. Boyertown Area School Dist., 897 \nF.3d 518, 527 n. 53 (3rd Cir. 2018) (“If there were any doubt after Doe v. Luzerne County that \nthe constitution recognizes a right to privacy in a person’s unclothed or partially clothed body, \nwe hold today that such a right exists.”), petition for cert. filed Nov. 21, 2018.  The Third Circuit \nwent on to hold that a school district’s policy of allowing transgender students access to \nopposite-sex bathrooms and locker rooms “‘served a compelling state interest in not \ndiscriminating against transgender students’ and was narrowly tailored to that interest.”  \nBoyertown, 897 F.3d at 528. \n  17 \n\nThe fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union \nrepose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by \nforcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only.  The child is not the \nmere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the \nright, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional \nobligations. \n \nPierce, 268 U.S. at 535.  In each case, the Supreme Court also noted the lack of challenge to the \nstate’s significant power over the provision of education.  Meyer, 262 U.S. at 402 (“The power of \nthe state to compel attendance at some school and to make reasonable regulations for all schools, \nincluding a requirement that they shall give instructions in English, is not questioned.  Nor has \nchallenge been made of the state’s power to prescribe a curriculum for institutions which it \nsupports”) (emphasis added); Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534 (“No question is raised concerning the \npower of the state reasonably to regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, \ntheir teachers and pupils, to require that all children of proper age attend some school, that \nteachers shall be of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that certain studies plainly \nessential to good citizenship be taught, and that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimical to \nthe public welfare.”).     \n  These cases have been interpreted to mean only that the state could not make its own \neducation mandatory or exclusive.  In Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976), private schools \nargued that to force them to integrate would, among other things, violate parents’ rights to direct \nthe education of their children.  The Supreme Court rejected the argument, noting that the right \nwas limited.  Runyon, 427 U.S. at 177.  It explained: \nIt is clear that the present application of s 1981 infringes no parental right \nrecognized [in our cases].  No challenge is made to the petitioner schools’ right to \noperate or the right of parents to send their children to a particular private school \nrather than public school.  Nor do these cases involve a challenge to the subject \nmatter which is taught at any private school.  [The private schools] remain \npresumptively free to inculcate whatever values and standards they deem \ndesirable.  Meyer and its progeny entitle them to no more. \n  18 \n\n \nRunyon, 427 U.S. at 177.  \n  Attempts to stretch the right to direct education beyond providing supplemental education \nor choosing private school as an alternative have not been successful.  Thomas v. Evansville-\nVanderburgh School Corp., 258 Fed.Appx. 50, 53-54 (7th Cir. 2007) (“We agree that [plaintiff] \nhas a fundamental right, secured by the due process clause, to direct the upbringing and \neducation of her child.  . . .  But a right to choose the type of school one’s child attends, or to \ndirect the private instruction of one’s child, does not imply a parent’s right to control every \naspect of her child’s education at a public school.”) (citing Fields v. Palmdale Sch. Dist., 427 \nF.3d 1197, 1204-07 (9th Cir. 2005); Leebaert v. Harrington, 332 F.3d 134, 140-42 (2d Cir. \n2003); Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 533-34 (1st Cir.1995); cf. \nWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232-33 (1972)).  In Fields, parents were (rightly) horrified to \nlearn the school district had allowed children as young as first grade to participate in a survey \nthat asked such questions as how much time they spent “thinking about touching other peoples’ \nprivate parts.”  Fields, 427 F.3d at 1200.  The Ninth Circuit rejected the parents’ argument that \nthe survey had violated their right to direct the education of their children, noting that “[s]chools \ncannot be expected to accommodate the personal, moral or religious concerns of every parent” \nand holding that “the Meyer-Pierce right does not extend beyond the threshold of the school \ndoor.”  Fields, 427 F.3d at 1206 & 1207.  Likewise, in Brown, the First Circuit rejected parents’ \nclaim that the district had violated their right to direct education when it held a mandatory AIDS-\nawareness assembly, during which the hired speaker, among other things, “simulated \nmasturbation,” “had a male lick an oversized condom with her, after which she had a female \nminor pull it over the male minor’s entire head and blow it up,” “encouraged a male minor to \n  19 \n\ndisplay his ‘orgasm face,’” and “informed a male minor he was not having enough orgasms.”  \nBrown, 68 F.3d at 529 & 534.  The First Circuit explained: \nThe Meyer and Pierce cases, we think, evince the principle that the state cannot \nprevent parents from choosing a specific educational program—whether it be \nreligious instruction at a private school or instruction in foreign language.  That is, \nthe state does not have the power to ‘standardize its children’ or ‘foster a \nhomogenous people’ by completely foreclosing the opportunity of individuals and \ngroups to choose a different path of education.  We do not think, however, that \nthis freedom encompasses a fundamental constitutional right to dictate the \ncurriculum at the public school to which they have chosen to send their children. \n \nBrown, 68 F.3d at 533 (internal citations omitted).   \n  In its brief, SPP argues that SPP Parents do not seek to control curriculum but rather to \n“preserve their parental right to teach modesty.”  (Plaintiffs’ Brief/Docket 211 at 14).  The \nalleged compelled affirmation policy, however, does not prevent SPP Parents from teaching their \nchildren modesty.  To be sure, the compelled affirmation policy might undercut that teaching, \nbut plaintiffs have cited no case that suggests the right to direct education includes a right not to \nhave their teachings undermined by public school (beyond, of course, the right to choose private \nschool instead).  Brown and Fields suggest the absence of such a right, and the Seventh Circuit \nhas cited those cases with approval.   \n  Because the right to direct the education of one’s children is a right to provide \nsupplemental education or to choose an alternative to public education rather than a right to \noverrule aspects of public education, it does not encompass the right SPP Parents assert.  \nAccordingly, Count III is dismissed.  Because the defect is not curable, the claim is dismissed \nwith prejudice.   \n  E.  Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n  In Count IV, SPP asserts that District 211 has violated the Illinois Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act (“IRFRA”), 775 ILCS 35/15.  The IRFRA provides: \n  20 \n\nGovernment may not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion, even if \nthe burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless it demonstrates that \napplication of the burden to the person (i) is in furtherance of a compelling \ngovernmental interest and (ii) is the least restrictive means of furthering that \ncompelling governmental interest. \n \n775 ILCS 35/15 (emphasis added).  The IRFRA defines “demonstrates” to mean “meets the \nburden of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.”  775 ILCS 35/5.  The IRFRA, \nthus, explicitly places on the government the burden of establishing that a burden to religion both \nserves a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means of compelling the interest, thereby \ngiving government an affirmative defense.  775 ILCS 35/5; see also Shatner v. Page, Case No. \n00-0251, 2009 WL 260788 at *21 (S.D. Ill. Feb. 4, 2009). \n  Defendants move to dismiss this count on several grounds, but two are non-starters.  \nSpecifically, defendants move to dismiss on the basis of two affirmative defenses.  A plaintiff \nneed not anticipate and plead around an affirmative defense, so an affirmative defense is not an \nappropriate basis on which to dismiss a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  Bausch v. Stryker Corp., 630 \nF.3d 546, 561 (7th Cir. 2010); Carr v. Tillery, 591 F.3d 909, 913 (7th Cir. 2010).  First, \ndefendants argue that District 211 has a compelling interest in its policy, which, as noted above, \nis an affirmative defense.  Second, defendants argue that SPP’s IRFRA claim is preempted.  \nPreemption, too, is an affirmative defense around which a plaintiff need not plead.  Bausch, 591 \nF.3d at 561 (“Preemption is an affirmative defense, and pleadings need to anticipate or attempt to \ncircumvent affirmative defenses.”).  The Court, accordingly, will not dismiss Count IV based on \nthose affirmative defenses. \n   The Court also notes that District 211 is wrong to complain that SPP has not adequately \nalleged membership in or adherence to a particular religion.  Plaintiffs are not required to do so.  \nThe IRFRA defines “exercise of religion” as “an act or refusal to act that is substantially \n  21 \n\nmotivated by religious belief, whether or not the religious exercise is compulsory or central to a \nlarger system of belief.”  775 ILCS 35/5; cf. Korte v. Sebellius, 735 F.3d 654, 683 (7th Cir. 2013) \n(“[T]he substantial burden inquiry does not invite the court to determine the centrality of the \nreligious practice to the adherent’s faith; RFRA is explicit about that.  And free-exercise doctrine \nmakes it clear that the test for substantial burden does not ask whether the claimant has correctly \ninterpreted his religious obligations.”).  It is enough that plaintiffs allege SPP Parents and SPP \nStudents have sincere religious beliefs that they should not undress or use the bathroom in front \nof members of the opposite sex and that SPP Parents have a sincere religious belief that they \nshould teach such modesty to their children.   \n  Defendants also argue that SPP fails to allege adequately a substantial burden to their \nexercise of religion.  For purposes of the IRFRA (like the federal Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct (“RFRA”) before it), “the hallmark of a substantial burden on one’s free exercise of religion \nis the presentation of a coercive choice of either abandoning one’s religious convictions or \ncomplying with the government regulation.”  Diggs v. Snyder, 333 Ill.App.3d 189, 194-95 (5th \nDist. 2002) (citing Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972)).  The Court disagrees with \ndefendants’ arguments that plaintiffs have not included sufficient facts.  The Court concludes \nthat SPP’s allegations provide sufficient notice of the claim.  Plaintiffs have alleged that District \n211 maintains a policy allowing male students with female genders to use the girls’ locker rooms \nand restrooms and female students with male genders to use the boys’ locker rooms and \nrestrooms.  Thus, SPP Students are at risk of exposure to opposite-sex individuals while they are \nundressing or using the restroom, in violation of their sincerely-held religious beliefs.  If that \nwere all plaintiffs had alleged, defendants might have a better argument about the absence of \ncoercion.  Plaintiffs, though, have alleged more.  Plaintiffs have alleged that District 211 requires \n  22 \n\nstudents to take physical education, which, often, requires students to change and/or shower \nbetween classes.  In addition, plaintiffs have alleged that District 211 requires students to take \nswim class and that the swim locker rooms do not have private changing stalls or private \nshowers.  Plaintiffs also allege that District 211 has conveyed to students that if a person objects \nto the compelled affirmation policy, the person is bigoted and intolerant.  That, combined with \nactual heckling by students, has dissuaded some SPP Students from asking to use a private locker \nroom.  Furthermore, some SPP Parents have had their requests that their children be allowed to \nuse a private locker room denied.  Although the Court is not deciding today whether SPP can \nprevail on this claim, the Court concludes that SPP has included sufficient facts to provide notice \nto District 211 of a plausible claim under the IRFRA.  Cf.  Stanley v. Carrier Mills-Stonefront \nSchool Dist. No. 2, 459 F. Supp.2d 766, 773 (S.D. Ill. Sept. 21, 2006) (holding parent \nchallenging school’s “opposite sex day” stated free exercise claim and noting “peer pressure \naccompanied by tacit approval from the administration could certainly amount to coercion”).   \n  Defendants’ motions to dismiss are denied as to Count IV. \n  F.  Free exercise under the First Amendment \n  In Count V, SPP asserts that its members’ right to free exercise of religion under the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution has been burdened.   \n  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, “Congress shall make \nno law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .”  U.S. \nConst. Amdt. 1 (emphasis added).  It applies to the states by incorporation into the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940).  The Supreme Court has said \nthe right to free exercise includes “the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine \none desires.”  Employment Division, Dep’t. of HR of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990).  \n  23 \n\nThe government, among other things, “may not compel affirmation of religious beliefs, punish \nexpression of religious doctrines it believes to be false, impose special disabilities on the basis of \nreligious views or religious status, or lend its power to one or the other side in controversies over \nreligious authority or dogma.”  Smith, 494 U.S. at 877 (internal citations omitted).   \n  As the Seventh Circuit has explained, the “Free Exercise Clause prohibits the government \nfrom ‘plac[ing]’ a substantial burden on the observation of a central religious belief or practice’ \nwithout first demonstrating that a ‘compelling governmental interest’ justifies the burden.”  St. \nJohn’s United Church of Christ v. City of Chi., 502 F.3d 616, 631 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting \nHernandez v. C.I.R., 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989)); see also Fleishfresser, 15 F.3d at 689.  Here, \nagain, a substantial burden means a coercive effect.  Fleishfresser, 15 F.3d at 689-90.  “Neutral \nlaws of general applicability,” however, “do not run afoul of the Free Exercise Clause, even if \nthese laws have the incidental effect of burdening a religious practice.”  St. John’s, 502 F.3d at \n631 (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 883).  The Supreme Court has explained: \nFacial neutrality is not determinative.  The Free Exercise Clause, like the \nEstablishment Clause, extends beyond facial discrimination.  The Clause ‘forbids \nsubtle departures from neutrality,’ and ‘covert suppression of particular religious \nbeliefs.’ \n \nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534 (1993). \n  The Court agrees with defendants that the compelled affirmative policy is facially \nneutral.  The allegations in the complaint do not suggest that the policy targets religion.  See \nIllinois Bible Colleges Assoc. v. Anderson, 870 F.3d 631, 639 (7th Cir. 2017) (“The statutes in \nthis case conform to the strictures of the Free Exercise Clause.  First, they are neutral:  They do \nnot target religion or religious institutions.  There is no allegation of underlying religious \nanimus.”).  What distinguishes this case from Illinois Bible Colleges, though, is that plaintiffs \nhave alleged that District 211 conveyed to students that anyone who objects to the compelled \n  24 \n\naffirmation policy is a bigot or intolerant.  That sounds like the sort of “subtle departure” from \nneutrality that might support a claim under the Free Exercise Clause. \n  Thus, the Court concludes that plaintiff SPP has given District 211 sufficient notice of a \nplausible claim under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  Defendants’ motions to \ndismiss are denied as to Count V. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \n  For the reasons set forth above, the Court grants in part and denies in part District 211’s \nmotion to dismiss [202].

R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) or, alternatively, for  permissive intervention \nunder Rule 24(b)(1).1 Federal Defendants oppose the motion to intervene as of right and take no \n                                            \n1 The individual intervenors are minors and seek to proceed pseudonymously. If the Court grants Movants leave to \nintervene, Movants will file a motion to proceed pseudonymously setting out the basis for this request.  \n \n\n \nposition on permissive intervention; the District Defendants take no position at this time; and \nPlaintiffs oppose this motion. \n1.  Movants  are  Students  A,  B,  and  C  and  the  Illinois  Safe  Schools  Alliance \n(“Alliance”). The facts below are supported by the declarations of parents and guardians of each \nstudent Movant and of Owen Daniel-McCarter as representative of the Alliance. See Exhs. 1-4 \n(exhibit references herein are to the exhibits attached to the Memorandum of Law filed in \nsupport of this Motion).2 \n2.  Students A, B, and C are transgender students who attend or will in the near \nfuture attend high school in Township High School District 211 (“the District”). Student A is a \ngirl who attends William Fremd High School (“Fremd”) in the District. The Complaint is \nlargely  based  on  Student  A’s  interactions  with  the  District,  culminating  in  the  District’s \nagreement with the Department of Education’s (“ED”) Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) to \npermit Student A to change clothes in the girls’ locker room at Fremd. As the accompanying \nmemorandum of law describes, Student A’s hard-won struggle to use the girls’ restrooms and \nlocker rooms at school places her at the very center of this dispute. See Exh. 1. \n3.  Student B is a seventh-grade boy who will begin ninth grade at Fremd next year. \nHe wishes to begin using the boys’ locker room at school once he begins hormone therapy. Upon \nhis arrival at Fremd, Student B expects to be able to use the boys’ restrooms and locker rooms \nconsistent with the requirements of Title IX and the District’s resolution agreement with OCR, \nwhich Plaintiffs challenge here. A contrary outcome would foreclose Student B’s ability to \nproceed through everyday life at school in a manner consistent with his gender identity and cause \nhim great emotional distress. See Exh. 2. \n                                            \n2 This motion satisfies Movants’ responsibilities under Rule 24(c) because no pleading from any Defendant asserting \na claim or defense is currently due. Movants will file such a pleading at the appropriate time if they are granted \nleave to intervene. \n2 \n \n\n \n4.  Student C is an eighth-grade boy who will attend a District high school in the \n2016-2017  academic  year.  He  wishes  to  use  the  boys’  restrooms  and  locker  rooms  there \nconsistent with his male gender identity. Student C would feel extreme distress and discomfort if \nhe were denied access to the boys’ facilities at school, which would separate him from the other \nboys and send him the message that he is different and should be ashamed of who he is. See Exh. \n3. \n5.  The Illinois Safe Schools Alliance (the “Alliance”) promotes safety, support, and \nhealthy development for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in \nIllinois schools through advocacy, education, youth organizing, and research. In his capacity as \nthe Policy and Advocacy Director of the Alliance, Owen Daniel-McCarter has worked with \nschool  districts  in  Illinois  to  draft  transgender  inclusion  policies  for  school  staff  and \nadministration.  He  has  also  conducted  training  for  school  staff  and  administration  called \n“Transgender 101,” which introduces transgender terminology, an overview of best practices for \naccommodating the legal rights of transgender students, and other types of training. In addition, \nthe Alliance advocates for gender inclusivity in schools, LGBT-affirming curriculum, bullying \nprevention, and restorative school discipline practices to prevent student push-out from school. \nAlliance staff assisted Student A in her efforts to use gender-appropriate facilities in the District, \nand engaged in training on the issue in the District. See Exh. 4. \n6.  Movants seek to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), \nor, alternatively, for permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b).  \n7.  Movants satisfy all the requirements for intervention of right.  \na.  The motion to intervene is timely because it is being filed less than a \nmonth after Plaintiffs filed their complaint, and before this Court has ruled \n3 \n \n\n \n(or even set a briefing schedule) on any motions, and because it poses no \ndanger of prejudice to any existing party.  \nb.  Movants’  interest  in  this  dispute  is  significant,  as  each  Movant  has \ninterests within the zone protected by Title IX, each of which would be \nseverely impaired if the District’s resolution agreement with OCR, its \ntransgender restroom policies, or OCR’s interpretation of Title IX were to \nbe held unlawful. \nc.   The District Defendants do not adequately represent the interests of the \nMovants. The District has been intransigent in its approach to transgender \nstudents’ use of locker room facilities. For example, it refused to allow \nStudent A to use the girls’ locker rooms at Fremd even after OCR found \nthat this violates Title IX, agreed to do so only after being threatened with \nloss  of  federal  funding,  and  refused  to  recognize  that  the  resolution \nagreement applies to other transgender students. \nd.  Federal  Defendants  also  do  not  adequately  represent  the  interests  of \nMovants, whose interests in this case are acutely personal and differ in \ndegree and kind from the interests of Federal Defendants. For example, \nED has taken the position that the resolution agreement applies only to \nStudent A’s use of the girls’ locker rooms, but Movants believe it applies \nto all students in the District. Movants also will make legal arguments that \nare different from those that Federal Defendants are likely to make. For \nexample, based on ED’s briefs in other cases, Federal Defendants are \nunlikely to argue that the prohibitions Plaintiffs seek deny equal protection \n4 \n \n\n \non  the  basis  of  sex,  whereas  Movants  will  make  that  constitutional \nargument.  Plaintiffs  raise  other  federal  and  state  constitutional  and \nstatutory claims based on the right to privacy and to control the upbringing \nof children as well as the freedom of religion, as to which there is no \nreason to believe Federal Defendants’ views mirror those of Movants, or \nthat Federal Defendants will adequately represent Movants’ interests in \nareas far beyond ED’s core expertise. \n8.  Alternatively, Movants satisfy the standard for permissive intervention under Rule \n24(b)(1). Permissive intervention lies in the sound discretion of this Court, which may permit \nanyone to intervene who has a “defense that shares with the main action a common question of \nlaw  or  fact.”  Rule  24(b)(1)(B).  Here,  Movants  include  the  student  at  the  center  of  this \ncontroversy, students who will be in the same position in the near future, and an organization \nwith a mission to promote the interests of transgender students in Illinois. Because their interests \nare at stake—dismantling the resolution agreement, the District’s transgender restroom policy, \nand ED’s guidance would fundamentally change the individual Movants’ lives and the Alliance’s \nadvocacy work—Movants are uniquely qualified to illuminate the relevant facts and tie them to \ntheir legal arguments, which warrants their intervention. \n9.  Movants have conferred with the parties to determine their positions on this \nmotion to intervene. Federal Defendants oppose Movants’ request to intervene of right, and take \nno position on their request for permissive intervention. District 211 takes no position on the \nmotion to intervene until such time it reviews the motion. Plaintiffs intend to oppose the motion \nto intervene. \n5 \n \n\n \nFor  these  reasons  and  those  expressed  in  the  accompanying  memorandum  of  law, \nMovants respectfully urge this Court to GRANT their motion to intervene and permit their \nintervention in this case in an expeditious fashion. \n \nDated:  May 25, 2016  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nJohn Knight  /s/ Britt M.

This is a civil rights action to stop the Township High School District \n211  (“District”)  from  violating  students’  statutory  rights  under  Title  IX  of  the \nEducation Amendments Act of 1972; students’ rights to bodily privacy under the \nUnited States Constitution; and various other constitutional and statutory rights \nheld by the SPP Students and Parents. 1 \n                                            \n1 The following conventions are used in this complaint: “SPP Students” refers generally to \nstudent members of Students and Parents for Privacy regardless of their sex, while “SPP \n1 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 2 of 65 PageID #:2801\n \n2.  Defendants  injure  the  Plaintiffs  through  their  application  and \nenforcement of the District’s policy (“Compelled Affirmation Policy”) that among \nother  things,  authorizes  students  of  one  sex  to  enter  multi-user  locker  rooms, \nrestrooms, and showers (generally, “privacy facilities”) of the opposite sex, as well as \nto share overnight accommodations with a member of the opposite sex on school \nactivity trips. The current policy was preceded by a Restroom Policy and a Locker \nRoom Agreement (described below) that also authorized opposite-sex access2 to the \nDistrict’s privacy facilities. \n3.  Such multi-user privacy facilities are reserved to the use of one sex to \nprovide  privacy from  the  other  sex,  pursuant to  state  and federal  statutes  and \nregulations, and constitutional authorities. \n4.  Every District student has a legally protected reasonable expectation of \nprivacy from the opposite sex within the District’s multi-user privacy facilities. \n5.  To protect student privacy from the opposite sex, the District by policy \nexcludes males from female privacy facilities. \n6.  To protect student privacy from the opposite sex, the District by policy \nexcludes females from male privacy facilities. \n7.  To  protect  District  students’  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy,  the \nDistrict prohibits routine video surveillance of washrooms, gymnasium or swimming \npool locker rooms, changing areas, or showers. \n                                            \nGirls” or “SPP Boys” respectively refer to female or male SPP Students. Similar conventions \nare followed to denote SPP Parents, and “Parent” means legal guardians as well as parents. \n2 “Access” as used herein means both access to, and use of, a given privacy space. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 3 of 65 PageID #:2802\n \n8.  The District may discipline a student of one sex who enters a multi-user \nprivacy facility of the other sex without the District’s authorization if the facility is \nthen in use. \n9.  The District may discipline a student of one sex who enters a multi-user \nprivacy facility of the other sex without the District’s authorization if the facility is \nnot then in use. \n10.  The District admits that students have been authorized to “daily use \nbathrooms and locker rooms of their gender identity in multiple schools” and that \nevery such student in District 211 “who has requested use of the locker room of their \nidentified gender has been offered such access, along with other supports within an \nindividual support plan.” Exhibit A (A Message from Superintendent Daniel Cates \n(December 1, 2017), https://adc.d211.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sups-Message-\n12-1-2017.pdf). \n11.  The District has violated every District student’s reasonable expectation \nof privacy by authorizing some students of one sex to access opposite-sex multi-user \nprivacy facilities, so as to affirm those students’ claimed genders. \n12.  Sex and gender are not the same thing. \n13.  Sex is to be either male or female as is determined by the union of male \nand female gametes at conception.3 \n                                            \n3 There are rare, objectively diagnosable disorders of sexual development (such as abnormal \nchromosomal complement or ambiguous primary or secondary sex characteristics), which are \ntermed “intersex.” This objective medical condition is not at issue in this case. “Primary sex \ncharacteristics”  refers  to  those  body  organs  essential  to  reproduction;  “secondary  sex \ncharacteristics” refer to features related to one’s sex that develop through puberty. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 4 of 65 PageID #:2803\n \n14.  Sex  is  binary,  objectively  provable,  and  grounded  in  the  fact  that \nhumans reproduce sexually. \n15.  The physical differences between males and females are enduring. \n16.  The sexes are not fungible. \n17.  Gender is a social construct that comprises a malleable continuum of \ngenders ranging from a very masculine gender to a very feminine gender, to genders \nwhich are ambiguous (e.g, one of a number of “nonbinary” genders), or a person may \nclaim to have no gender at all (e.g., agender).4 \n18.  Gender may be established only by accepting a person’s self-declaration \nof his or her self-perceived gender. \n19.  Gender  dysphoria  describes  when  a  person’s  perceived  gender  is \ndiscordant from the person’s sex. \n20.  Gender  dysphoria  may  produce  clinically  significant  distress  in  the \ndysphoric person. \n21.  Applying the Compelled Affirmation Policy results in intermingling the \ntwo sexes within privacy facilities when the District authorizes, for example, a male \nstudent who claims a feminine gender (and thus believes himself to be female) to \naccess the female multi-user privacy facilities that are otherwise lawfully reserved \nfor exclusively female use. \n                                            \n4 Plaintiffs use sex and gender herein as defined above, and use pronouns consistent with the \nsex of the person to whom the pronoun refers. Similarly, “girl” denotes a female and “boy” \ndenotes a male. \n4 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 5 of 65 PageID #:2804\n \n22.  The District does not require a given student to be diagnosed as having \nany medical or psychological condition whatsoever as a condition of the student \naccessing opposite-sex multi-user privacy facilities under the Compelled Affirmation \nPolicy. \n23.  There  are  no  controlled,  randomized  studies  that  demonstrate  the \nefficacy or safety of students accessing the other sex’s privacy facilities as a method \nof affirming a student’s claimed gender. \n24.  There  is  no  known  organic  cause  for  a  person  to  claim  a  gender \ndiscordant with his or her sex. \n25.  The sole dispositive criterion that the District relies upon to authorize \nopposite sex access for a given student is that student’s declaration of his or her \ngender. \n26.  Consequently, the District’s enforcement of the Compelled Affirmation \nPolicy results in SPP Students—some of whom are as young as fourteen years old—\nexperiencing  embarrassment,  humiliation,  anxiety,  fear,  apprehension,  stress, \ndegradation, and loss of dignity because the District has intentionally violated their \nreasonable expectation of privacy within the multi-user privacy facilities. \n27.  Similarly,  the  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  puts  SPP  Students  at \ncontinual  risk  of  encountering,  and  in  some  instances  actually  encountering, \nmembers of the opposite sex within multi-user privacy facilities while students using \nthe facility are disrobing, toileting, showering, and for some girls, while they are \n5 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 6 of 65 PageID #:2805\n \ndealing  with  highly  personal  feminine  hygiene  matters  while  in  the  throes  of \nadolescence. \n28.  SPP Students have not consented to this risk of encountering, or the \nactual  encounters  with  members  of  the  opposite  sex  within  multi-user  privacy \nfacilities. \n29.  The  District’s  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  violates  SPP  Students’ \nreasonable expectation of privacy in their multi-user privacy facilities. \n30.  The impacts on SPP Students and Parents from the District enforcing \nthe Compelled Affirmation Policy and its predecessor policies violate the Students’ \nrights under Title IX and violate their bodily privacy rights under the Constitution of \nthe United States. These impacts also deprive SPP Parents of their fundamental \nconstitutional right to direct the education and upbringing of their children. Finally, \nenforcing the Compelled Affirmation Policy violates the right to the free exercise of \nreligion  of  some  Christian  SPP  Students  and  Parents  under  the  United  States \nConstitution and Illinois law. \n31.  Plaintiffs therefore seek relief from this honorable Court. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n32.   This action arises under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 et seq. (the “Civil Rights \nAct”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et. seq. (“Title IX”), the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution, and the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \n775 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. §§ 35/1 et seq. \n33.   The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1343, 1361, and 1367. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 7 of 65 PageID #:2806\n \n34.  The Court has jurisdiction to issue the requested declaratory relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57. \n35.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  award  the  requested  injunctive  relief \nunder 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 703, 20 U.S.C. § 1683, 42 U.S.C. § 20000bb-1(c), 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1343(a)(3), 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. § 35/20, and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n65. \n36.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  award  nominal  and  compensatory \ndamages under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4). \n37.  The Court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412 and 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n38.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e), \nbecause a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to all claims occurred \nin this district where Township High School District 211 is located. \nPLAINTIFFS \n39.  Plaintiff Students and Parents for Privacy is a voluntary unincorporated \nassociation comprised of students who currently attend, or will be attending, District \nhigh schools and their parents. \n40.  Plaintiff Victoria Wilson is the president of Students and Parents for \nPrivacy, and is the mother of two students enrolled in District schools. \n41.  All Plaintiffs are citizens of the United States and residents of Cook \nCounty, Illinois. \n7 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 8 of 65 PageID #:2807\n \nDEFENDANTS \n42.  Defendant School Directors of Township High School District 211 is a \nschool district organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, and may be sued in \nthis Court pursuant to 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-2. \n43.  The District is comprised of public educational institutions that provide \na high school education to both male and female students. \n44.  The District receives federal educational funds sufficient to bring it \nunder the legal requirements of Title IX. \n45.  Intervenor-Defendant  Student  A  is  a  male  student  who  claims  a \nfeminine gender and is an alumnus of Fremd High School. \n46.  Intervenor-Defendants  Students  B  and  C  are  students  who  claim \ngenders discordant with their sex and are currently enrolled in District schools. \n47.  Intervenor-Defendant  Illinois  Safe  Schools  Alliance  is  an  advocacy \norganization that promotes the interests of “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and \nquestioning”  youth  and  provided  training  to  the  District.  The  Alliance  assisted \nStudent A in seeking access to female privacy facilities in the District. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nHow the Compelled Affirmation Policy developed. \n48.  When Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on May 4, 2016, Student A was a male \n11th grade student at Fremd High School. \n49.  Student A was born a male. \n50.  Student A is male. \n8 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 9 of 65 PageID #:2808\n \n51.  Until Student A was in middle school, Student A used male privacy \nfacilities. \n52.  At some point during middle school, Student A claimed a feminine \ngender. \n53.  Before Student A began classes at Fremd, his parents communicated to \nDistrict officials that Student A was to be treated as a girl once he was in high school. \n54.  After entering high school, the District \na.  created an individualized support plan to foster affirmation of \nStudent A’s claimed gender and mitigate any adverse impacts \nfrom the gender affirmation process; \nb.  formed a support team of District staff to facilitate affirming \nStudent  A’s  claimed  gender  and  to  minimize  stresses  to \nStudent A; \nc.  changed some or all of Student A’s school records to state that \nhe was female; \nd.  required District staff to use Student A’s preferred female \nname and pronouns; \ne.  allowed Student A to participate in girls’ athletics; and \nf.  authorized Student A to use the girls’ restrooms (“Restroom \nPolicy”). \n9 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 10 of 65 PageID #:2809\n \n55.  Prior to the 2013-14 school year, all District schools separated their \nmulti-user restrooms by sex: only females were allowed to use girls’ restrooms and \nonly males were allowed to use boys’ restrooms. \n56.  The district separated the sexes in multi-user restrooms to protect each \nuser’s reasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex. \n57.  Student  A  and  his  parents  sought  access  to  girls’  privacy  facilities \nbecause those facilities were reserved to the use of, and used by, female students. \n58.  If female students did not use the girls’ privacy facilities, Student A \nwould not have sought access to those facilities. \n59.  During the 2013-14 school year, the District authorized Student A to \naccess all girls’ restrooms at Fremd. \n60.  The District authorized Student A to access the girls’ restrooms so as to \naffirm his claimed gender. \n61.  No Illinois law obligated the District to authorize Student A to access \ngirls’ restrooms. \n62.  No federal law obligated the District to authorize Student A to access \ngirls’ restrooms. \n63.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ restrooms \nbased on Student A manifesting appearances or behaviors that would be stereotypical \nof females. \n64.  The  District  did  not  prohibit  Student  A  from  accessing  the  boys’ \nrestrooms. \n10 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 11 of 65 PageID #:2810\n \n65.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ restrooms \nto protect his reasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex. \n66.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ restrooms \nto protect the reasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex of the female \nstudents using the facility. \n67.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ restrooms \non the basis of his sex. \n68.  The District did not notify parents or students that it had authorized a \nmale student to access girls’ restrooms. \n69.  The District did not notify parents or students that the District was \nusing its otherwise sex-separated restrooms to affirm a student’s claimed gender. \n70.  Some SPP Girls found out about the new policy when they walked into \ntheir restroom and encountered Student A. \n71.  They were startled, shocked, embarrassed, and made afraid by finding \na male in the girls’ bathroom. \n72.  At some time after authorizing Student A to access the girls’ restrooms, \nthe District applied the same standard for access to all restrooms at all schools in the \nDistrict. \n73.  Under  this  expanded  policy  (“Restroom  Affirmation  Policy”),  any \nstudent seeking to affirm a claimed gender that was discordant from the student’s \nsex was authorized to access restrooms consistent with his or her claimed gender. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 12 of 65 PageID #:2811\n \n74.  District Superintendent Daniel E. Cates later explained the District’s \nrationale for the Restroom Affirmation Policy, saying that “[t]ransgender students \nwho don’t want separate private accommodations are allowed to use restrooms in \naccordance with their gender identity, as there are private stalls available.” (V.W. \nDecl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. 3, ECF No. 21-5 at 2 of 3.) \n75.  Despite the District providing a dedicated support team for Student A \nand complying with every request Student A made to have his claimed gender \naffirmed other than access to the girls’ locker rooms, Student A demanded access to \nthe girls’ locker rooms so as to affirm his claimed gender. \n76.  Student A accessed one or more girls’ locker rooms one or more times \nprior to the District creating a policy to authorize his access to girls’ locker rooms. \n77.  One female student, who had been previously sexually assaulted, was \nexposed to Student A’s genitalia within a girls’ locker room in January, 2014. \n78.  Despite notice of that incident and subsequent incidents, the District \nfailed to properly investigate or remediate the situation. \n79.  The initial exposure to male genitalia, and subsequent similar incidents, \ntraumatized the girl, who committed suicide in 2017. \n80.  The District initially refused to grant Student A access to the girls’ \nlocker rooms after he began classes at Fremd. \n81.  The District’s refusal to grant Student A access to the girls’ locker rooms \nwas based on Student A being male. \n12 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 13 of 65 PageID #:2812\n \n82.  The District’s refusal to grant Student A access to the girls’ locker rooms \nwas intended to protect the reasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex \nof the females who used those facilities. \n83.  The District’s refusal to grant Student A access to the girls’ locker rooms \nwas grounded in at least two constitutional privacy concerns: \na.  Authorizing Student A to be in a girls’ locker room would \nexpose female students as young as fifteen years old to being \nobserved  in  a  state  of  undress  by  a  biologically  male \nindividual; and \nb.  Authorizing Student A to be in a girls’ locker room would \nexpose girls as young as fifteen years old to a biologically male \nbody. \n(V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. 8, ECF No. 21-10 at 11 of 15.) \n84.  The District’s refusal to grant Student A access to the girls’ locker rooms \nwas not based on Student A manifesting appearances or behaviors that might be \ncharacterized as sex stereotypes. \n85.  In  December  2013,  Student  A  filed  a  complaint  with  the  U.S. \nDepartment of Education Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) alleging that the District \nviolated his rights under Title IX when it denied him use of the girls’ locker rooms.  \n86.  The OCR investigated the District’s denial of access for Student A to the \ngirls’ locker rooms. \n13 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 14 of 65 PageID #:2813\n \n87.  Until  December  2,  2015,  when  the  District  agreed  with  the  OCR’s \nposition that Student A should have access to the girls’ locker rooms, the District \nrefused to authorize Student A to access the girls’ locker rooms. \n88.  In support of denying Student A access to the girls’ locker rooms, the \nDistrict stated: \na.  “The goal of the District . . . is to protect the privacy rights of \nall students when changing clothes or showering before or \nafter physical education and after-school activities, while also \nproviding  reasonable  accommodations  to  meet  the  unique \nneeds of individual students.” (V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. \nPrelim. Inj. Ex. 3, ECF No. 21-5 at 2 of 3.) \nb.  “District  211  has  supported  –  and  continues  to  support  – \ntransgender  students  and  their  families  while  always \nbalancing the rights and concerns of all students we serve.” \n(Id.) \nc.  “[T]he  District  will  continue  to  provide  private \naccommodations  for  transgender  students  to  ensure  a \nrespectful school environment[.]” (Id.; V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ \nMot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. 2, ECF No. 21-4 at 2 of 3.) \nd.  “District 211 has provided individual accommodations in a \nmanner that does not infringe on the privacy concerns of other \nstudents.” (Id.) \n14 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 15 of 65 PageID #:2814\n \ne.  “Our  position  throughout  this  ongoing  matter  has  always \ncentered  on  safeguarding  student  privacy  and  upholding \ndignity for all students in our district.” Exhibit B (Post-Board \nof Education Vote Statement by Township High School District \n211  Superintendent  of  Schools  Daniel  Cates  (December  2, \n2015), https://adc.d211.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cates \n-Public-Statements.pdf). \nf.  “[P]ermitting Student A to be present in the locker room would \nexpose female students to being observed in a state of undress \nby a biologically male individual.” (V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. \nPrelim. Inj. Ex. 8, ECF No. 21-10 at 11 of 15.) \ng.  “Granting Student A the option to change . . . clothes in the \ngirls’ locker room would expose students . . . to a biologically \nmale body.” (Id.) \n89.  On November 2, 2015, the OCR issued its Letter of Findings in Student \nA’s case, concluding \nthat [the District], on the basis of sex, excluded Student A from \nparticipation  in  and  denied  [Student  A]  the  benefits  of  its \neducation program, provided [Student A] different benefits or \nbenefits in a different manner, subjected [Student A] to different \nrules  of  behavior,  and  subjected  [Student  A]  to  different \ntreatment in violation of the Title IX regulation, at 34 C.F.R. § \n106.31. \n(V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. 8, ECF No. 21-10 at 14 of 15.) \n90.  The Letter of Findings further provided “[i]f an agreement is not reached \nwithin 30 calendar days of the date of this [l]etter . . . OCR must follow the procedures \n15 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 16 of 65 PageID #:2815\n \nin  its  Case  Processing  Manual,  at  Section  305  for  the  issuance  of  a  Letter  of \nImpending Enforcement Action.” (Id.) \n91.  The OCR Case Processing Manual Section 305 details information that \nmust be included in a Letter of Impending Enforcement Action if the recipient of the \nLetter  of  Findings  “refuses  to  make  a  commitment  to  voluntarily  resolve  the \nidentified areas of noncompliance[.]” Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Dep’t. of Educ., Case \nProcessing  Manual  32  (2015),  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/\nocrcpm.pdf. \n92.  The OCR Case Processing Manual at Article VI states that to “initiate \nenforcement action[,]” “OCR will either: (1) initiate administrative proceedings to \nsuspend, terminate, or refuse to grant or continue and defer financial assistance from, \nor with respect to the Boy Scouts Act, funds made available through the Department \nto the recipient; or (2) refer the case to DOJ for judicial proceedings to enforce any \nrights of the United States under any law of the United States.” Id. at 28. \n93.  The  District’s  budget  from  July  1,  2015  to  June  30,  2016  included \nreceipts of approximately $6,160,700 in federal aid. \n94.  Once the Letter of Findings issued, the District voluntarily decided to \naffirm Student A’s claimed gender by authorizing his access to the girls’ locker rooms. \n95.  On December 2, 2015, the District signed an Agreement to Resolve OCR \nCase No. 05-14-1055 (“Locker Room Agreement”). (V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. \nInj. Ex. 1, ECF No. 21-3.)  \n16 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 17 of 65 PageID #:2816\n \n96.  The Locker Room Agreement stated “For the duration of Student A’s \nenrollment in the District . . . the District agrees to provide Student A access to locker \nroom facilities designated for female students at school[.]” (Id. at 3 of 6.) \n97.  Prior to December 2, 2015, all of the schools in the District separated \ntheir locker rooms and related shower areas by sex: only females were allowed to use \nthe girls’ locker rooms, and only males were allowed to use the boys’ locker rooms. \n98.  The district separated the locker rooms by sex to protect each user’s \nreasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex. \n99.  The Locker Room Agreement acknowledged that the privacy interests of \nthe female students would be at risk when the District authorized access for Student \nA: \na.  “Student A[] represent[ed] that she will change in private \nchanging stations in the girls’ locker rooms[.]” (Id.) \nb.  “[T]he District agrees to . . . take steps to protect the privacy \nof its students by installing and maintaining sufficient privacy \ncurtains (private changing stations) within the girls’ locker \nrooms to accommodate Student A and any students who wish \nto be assured of privacy while changing[.]” (Id.) \nc.  “If any student requests additional privacy in the use of sex-\nspecific  facilities  designed  for  female  students  beyond  the \nprivate changing stations described in item II.A.1, the District \nwill  provide  that  student  with  access  to  a  reasonable \n17 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 18 of 65 PageID #:2817\n \nalternative, such as assignment of a student locker in near \nproximity to the office of a teacher or coach; use of another \nprivate area (such as a restroom stall) within the public area; \nuse of a nearby private area (such as a single-use facility); or \na separate schedule of use.” (Id.) \n100.   District  Superintendent  Daniel  Cates  made  the  following  public \nstatements after the District voted to approve the Locker Room Agreement with OCR: \na.  “OCR threatened to pursue enforcement action against the \nDistrict  including  withholding  federal  funding  unless  a \nresolution was reached within 30 days.” Exhibit B. \nb.  “By reaching this mutual agreement with OCR, the threat of \nfurther litigation specific to the initial complaint has ended, \nand the District will retain full access to its federal funds used \nprimarily to serve at-risk students.” Id. \n101.  District Superintendent Daniel Cates clarified that the Locker Room \nAgreement “pertains solely to this individual student and does not require a District-\nwide policy[.]” Id. \n102.  The Locker Room Agreement states that Student A represented that he \nwould change in private changing stations in the locker rooms, but nothing in the \nagreement required him to do so. \n103.  The Locker Room Agreement did not provide any penalty if Student A \ndid not use a private changing station in the girls’ locker room. \n18 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 19 of 65 PageID #:2818\n \n104.  During his tenure in the girls’ locker rooms, Student A failed to use a \nprivate changing station on one or more occasions. \n105.  The District authorized Student A to access the girls’ locker rooms so as \nto affirm his claimed gender. \n106.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ locker \nrooms based on Student A manifesting appearances or behaviors that would be \nstereotypical of females. \n107.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ locker \nrooms to protect his reasonable expectation of privacy from males. \n108.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ locker \nrooms to protect the reasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex of female \nstudents using the facility. \n109.  The District did not authorize Student A’s access to the girls’ locker \nrooms on the basis of his sex. \n110.  The District did not prohibit Student A from accessing the boys’ locker \nrooms. \n111.  The District chose to affirm Student A’s claimed gender by authorizing \nStudent A to access the girls’ locker rooms because those facilities were designated \nfor, and were used only by, females. \n112.  If females did not use the girls’ locker rooms, the District would not have \nbeen able to affirm Student A’s claimed gender by granting Student A the use of those \nfacilities. \n19 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 20 of 65 PageID #:2819\n \n113.  After the Locker Room Agreement became effective, at least one SPP \nParent requested that the District protect her daughter’s privacy by providing her \ndaughter access to the same private locker room that the District provided to Student \nA before the Locker Room Agreement was effective. \n114.  The District refused to make that locker room available to the daughter. \n115.  At some time after authorizing Student A to access the girls’ locker \nrooms, the District applied the same standard for access to all locker rooms at all \nschools in the District. \n116.  Under this new policy (“Locker Room Affirmation Policy”), any student \nseeking to affirm a claimed gender that is discordant from the student’s sex would be \nauthorized to access locker rooms consistent with his or her claimed gender. \n117.  The Locker  Room Affirmation  Policy  and the  Restroom  Affirmation \nPolicy together comprise the District’s current Compelled Affirmation Policy. \n118.  Prior to enforcing the Compelled Affirmation Policy, the District made \nno intentional, systematic effort to examine the quality or reliability of the science \nunderlying gender affirmation treatments. \n119.  Prior to enforcing the Compelled Affirmation Policy, the District made \nno  intentional,  systematic  effort  to  understand the  psychological  impacts  on  an \nadolescent student who is exposed to the opposite sex in a privacy facility where that \nadolescent has a reasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex. \n   \n20 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 21 of 65 PageID #:2820\n \n120.  The District currently enforces the Compelled Affirmation Policy on all \nof its students and on all of its campuses: \na.   “[M]ultiple transgender students . . . daily use bathrooms and \nlocker rooms of their gender identity” in “multiple” District \nschools.  Exhibit  C  (Media  Statement  from  Superintendent \nDaniel  Cates  Regarding  ACLU  Lawsuit  filed  11-30-2017 \n(November  30,  2017),  https://adc.d211.org/wp-content/ \nuploads/2017/11/D211-Statement-11-30-2017.pdf). \nb.  “Every transgender student in the District who has requested \nuse of the locker room of their identified gender has been \noffered such access[.]” Exhibit A. \nc.  “Every day in our  schools,  transgender  students have  full \naccess to the bathrooms of their identified gender. Each day, \ntransgender students use the locker room of their identified \ngender.” Id. \nd.  The District has explained that “accommodating access to all \nfacilities” of the opposite sex is one of the supports the District \n“provide[s] to students experiencing transgender identity.” Id. \ne.  The  District  did  not  explain  how  authorizing  opposite-sex \naccess  to  multi-user  privacy  facilities  would  mitigate  the \n“unspoken  discomfort”  that  many  teenagers  have  when \n \n21 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 22 of 65 PageID #:2821\n \n“changing clothes or showering in the locker room.” Exhibit D \n(Statement of Daniel Cates, Superintendent, Township High \nSchool District 211, Judge rules in favor of balanced access to \nlocker room (Jan. 25, 2018), https://adc.d211.org/wp-content/ \nuploads/2018/01/D211-Statement-1-25-2018.pdf). \n121.  Contemporaneously with the course of events leading up to and through \nthe early stages of this case, federal officials issued two letters purporting to interpret \n“sex” under Title IX to include gender identity: \na.  Letter to Emily Prince from James A. Ferg-Cadima, Acting \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights \nat the Department of Education dated January 7, 2015; and \nb.  Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students jointly issued \nby  the  Civil  Rights  Division of  the  Department of  Justice \n(DOJ) and the Department of Education dated May 13, 2016. \n(V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. 4, ECF 21-6.) \n122.  Although the OCR and DOJ postured the federal letters as binding \nguidance  on  the  schools,  neither  were  issued  pursuant  to  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking. \n123.  Although the OCR and DOJ postured the federal letters as binding \nguidance on the schools, neither letter adhered to the plain meaning of “sex” in Title \nIX. \n   \n22 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 23 of 65 PageID #:2822\n \n124.  On February 22, 2017, the OCR and the DOJ jointly issued another Dear \nColleague letter, stating that \nThe purpose of this guidance is to inform you that the Department \nof Justice and the Department of Education are withdrawing the \nstatements of policy and guidance reflected in: \n  Letter to Emily Prince from James A. Ferg-Cadima, Acting \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights \nat the Department of Education dated January 7, 2015; and \n  Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students jointly issued \nby the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and \nthe Department of Education dated May 13, 2016. \n(Fed. Defs.’ Notice to Court Attach., ECF No. 165-1.) \n125.  That letter stated as follows: \na.  “These  guidance  documents  take  the  position  that  the \nprohibitions on discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ in Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), 20 U.S.C. § \n1681 et seq., and its implementing regulations, see, e.g., 34 \nC.F.R.  §  106.33,  require  access  to  sex-segregated  facilities \nbased on gender identity.” (Id. at 2 of 3.) \nb.  “[T]he  Department  of  Education  and  the  Department  of \nJustice  have  decided  to  withdraw  and  rescind  the  above-\nreferenced guidance documents . . . .” (Id.) \nc.  “The Departments thus will not rely on the views expressed \nwithin them.” (Id.) \n23 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 24 of 65 PageID #:2823\n \n126.  In  a  letter  dated  June  7,  2017,  OCR  terminated  the  resolution \nagreement that had been entered into between OCR and the District on December 2, \n2015. \n127.  After  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  rescinded  its  2016  Dear \nColleague Letter and the earlier Ferg-Cadima letter, repudiated further reliance \nupon  the  positions  expressed  in  those  letters,  and  terminated  the  resolution \nagreement with the District, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the federal defendants \nfrom the instant lawsuit. (Pls.’ Notice Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 178; Min. Entry \nDismiss Fed. Def.s Without Prej., ECF No. 179.) \n128.  In February, 2018 the OCR announced that it would not process Title \nIX discrimination claims arising from a professed transgender student seeking access \nto opposite sex privacy facilities. \n129.  Currently  there  is  no  federal  or  state  authority  that  obligates  the \nDistrict to authorize students of one sex to access the multi-user privacy facilities of \nthe other sex so as to affirm a student’s claimed gender. \nHow the Compelled Affirmation Policy operates. \n130.  Under  the  Compelled  Affirmation Policy,  the  District  may affirm  a \nstudent who claims a gender discordant with his or her sex via such official acts as \na.  Using the student’s preferred name(s); \nb.  Using the student’s preferred pronouns; \nc.  Changing at least some school records to report the student’s \nclaimed gender in lieu of the student’s sex; \n24 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 25 of 65 PageID #:2824\n \nd.  Permitting the student to dress in accord with the student’s \nclaimed gender; \ne.  Instructing District staff to use the student’s preferred names \nand pronouns; \nf.  Instructing  other  District  students  to  use  the  student’s \npreferred names and pronouns; \ng.  Authorizing access to multi-user restrooms in accord with the \nstudent’s claimed gender rather than the student’s sex; \nh.  Authorizing access to multi-user locker rooms in accord with \nthe student’s claimed gender rather than the student’s sex, \nsubject  to  the  student  agreeing  to  take  additional  privacy \nmeasures—such as changing in a screened area or within a \nstall enclosure—while in the multi-user facility; \ni.  In some cases, authorizing unrestricted access to a multi-user \nlocker room in accord with the student’s claimed gender rather \nthan their sex; and \nj.  Authorizing a student to room with one or more students of \nthe other sex while engaged in authorized school activities \ninvolving overnight travel, contingent upon some element of \nparental consent to the arrangement. \n25 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 26 of 65 PageID #:2825\n \n131.  In respect to the overnight arrangements described in ¶ 130(j), the \nDistrict disclaims any obligation to ascertain the sexes of any particular student \ninvolved in the rooming arrangement. \n132.  In respect to the overnight arrangements described in ¶ 130(j), the \nDistrict disclaims any obligation to notify any of the parents of the sexes of the \nstudents involved in the arrangement. \n133.  In respect to the overnight arrangements described in ¶ 130(j), the \nDistrict disclaims any obligation to notify any of the students of the sexes of the other \nstudents involved in the arrangement. \n134.  The  District  may  or  may  not  provide  all  forms  of  affirmation  to  a \nparticular student, but typically affirms the student in the manner a student requests \nof the District. \n135.  Some or all of the methods described in ¶¶ 130(a)-(j) have been used in \nvarious combinations by the District to affirm students’ claimed genders. \n136.  Affirming a student’s claimed gender under the Compelled Affirmation \nPolicy requires the active participation and cooperation of third parties, including the \nSPP Students. \n137.  Pursuant to the Compelled Affirmation Policy, the District may direct \nother students to endorse or conform to actions taken by the District to affirm a \nparticular student’s claimed gender. \n138.  The District disclaims any duty or authority to notify any student of \nanother student’s claimed gender.  \n26 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 27 of 65 PageID #:2826\n \n139.  The District disclaims any duty or authority to notify any student using \na multi-user privacy facility that a student of the other sex has been authorized to \naccess that facility. \n140.  A student who claims a feminine or masculine gender may exhibit some \nset of behaviors and appearances reflecting the claimed gender, but the District does \nnot require a student to present in any particular way as a condition of accessing a \nmulti-user privacy facility reserved to the use of a single sex, when that student is \nseeking affirmation of his or her gender. \n141.  The sole dispositive criterion upon which the District relies to determine \na student’s gender is what that student declares his or her gender to be. \n142.  Unless the District has some legitimate basis to suspect a student’s \ndeclaration  of  gender  is  fraudulent  or  motivated  by  improper  purposes  (e.g., \nvoyeurism), it would not challenge a student’s claimed gender. \n143.  Other than reliance on a student’s declaration of the student’s gender, \nthe District has no objective criteria by which it may determine the gender of a \nstudent. \n144.  Under the Compelled Affirmation Policy a student may request access \nto a multi-user privacy facility that accords with the student’s claimed gender, or that \naccords with the student’s sex, regardless of whether the student manifests behaviors \nor appearances characteristic of the gender that the student claims. \n27 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 28 of 65 PageID #:2827\n \n145.  Once a student requests access to an opposite-sex privacy facility based \nupon that student’s claimed gender, under the Compelled Affirmation Policy the \nDistrict will authorize that access. \n146.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy applies to all enrolled students on all \nDistrict campuses. \n147.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy applies to all visiting students on all \nDistrict campuses. \n148.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy applies to all lawful visitors to all \nDistrict campuses. \n149.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy applies to all District staff. \n150.  Currently, there are male students who claim a feminine gender at one \nor more schools in the District. \n151.  Currently, there are female students who claim a masculine gender at \none or more schools in the District. \n152.  During the pendency of this litigation, one or more District students \nhave identified as a non-binary gender or as genderless. \n153.  One or more District students have identified as being of one or more \ndifferent genders over some period of time.5 \n                                            \n5 This is termed “gender fluidity” which “conveys a wider, more flexible range of gender \nexpression, with interests and behaviors that may even change from day to day. Gender fluid \npeople do not feel confined by restrictive boundaries of stereotypical expectations of women \nand men. For some people, gender fluidity extends beyond behavior and interests, and \nactually serves to specifically define their gender identity. In other words, a person may feel \nthey are more female on some days and more male on others, or possibly feel that neither \nterm  describes  them  accurately.  Their  identity  is  seen  as  being  gender  fluid.”  Gender \n28 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 29 of 65 PageID #:2828\n \n154.  The District does not provide multi-user privacy facilities reserved for \nthe exclusive use of students claiming \na.  a non-binary gender; \nb.  claiming to be genderless; or \nc.  claiming to be gender fluid. \n155.  Upon information and belief, one or more students of one sex are or were \nauthorized access to multi-user locker rooms reserved to the use of the other sex based \nupon those students’ claimed genders, without availing themselves of additional \nprivacy measures pursuant to the Compelled Affirmation Policy or its predecessor \npolicies. \n156.  Upon information and belief, one or more students of one sex are or were \nauthorized under the Compelled Affirmation Policy or its predecessor policies to \naccess multi-user restrooms reserved to the use of the other sex based upon those \nstudents’ claimed genders. \n157.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy authorizes any District student of one \nsex, who claims a gender identity of the other sex, to access a group shower facility \nreserved to the use of the other sex. \n158.  The  District  takes  the  position  that  a  male  student  who  claims  a \nfeminine gender is a member of the female sex. \n                                            \nDiversity, Gender Terminology, November 25, 2014, www.nwais.org/uploaded/conferences/\nGender_Identity/GD_Terminology_2014.pdf. \n \n29 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 30 of 65 PageID #:2829\n \n159.  The  District  takes  the  position  that  a  male  student  who  claims  a \nfeminine gender is legally indistinguishable from any member of the female sex.  \n160.  The District takes the position that a female student who claims a \nmasculine gender is a member of the male sex. \n161.  The District takes the position that a female student who claims a \nmasculine gender is legally indistinguishable from any member of the male sex. \n162.  The District takes the position that for a person whose sex and gender \nalign with one another, then that person’s primary sex characteristics serve as a \nproxy for assigning his or her sex based upon his or her gender identity. \n163.  The  District  has,  through  various  announcements  to  its  students, \nconveyed that a student’s objection to the Compelled Affirmation Policy implies \nintolerance or even bigotry on behalf of the objector. \n164.  The  District  has,  through  various  public  meetings,  conveyed  that \nobjections to the Compelled Affirmation Policy imply intolerance or even bigotry on \nbehalf of the objector. \n165.  The  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  is  particularly  likely  to  cause \nemotional and psychological trauma to female students who have been sexually \nassaulted, and for whom the presence of a male in their privacy facilities is likely \nterrifying and may result in further psychological trauma. \n166.  The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (the  “CDC”)  has \nobserved that some 10.3% of high school girls reported that they had already suffered \nforced intercourse. Laura Kann, et al., CDC, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance — \n30 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 31 of 65 PageID #:2830\n \nUnited States, 2015, 65 Morbidity & Mortality Wkly. Rep. Surveillance Summs. No. \nSS-6,  1  (June  10,  2016),  https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/2015/\nss6506_updated.pdf. \n167.  This means that more than one out of every ten high school girls has \nlikely suffered sexual assault. \nRisks to student’s privacy in locker rooms generally. \n168.  All District high schools have PE locker rooms restricted to the exclusive \nuse of one sex or the other. \n169.  Completing PE is a requirement to graduate, excepting situations where \nthe District may have waived the requirement for a student. \n170.  A PE class is a mandatory daily class for all four years of school in the \nDistrict. \n171.  It is normative for PE students to change into PE clothes within their \nrespective single-sex locker rooms. \n172.  Females  changing  for  PE,  gymnastics,  and  other  sports  activities \nsometimes change into sports bras during which time their breasts may be fully \nexposed. \n173.  Students changing for swim class may be fully nude while changing to \nor from their swimsuits. \n174.  Some  girls  showering  after  swim  class  turn  down  the  top  of  their \nswimsuits while rinsing off, during which time their breasts may be fully exposed. \n175.  As described in ¶¶ 163-164, the District’s thematic message delivered to \nstudents was that objections to sharing a multi-user privacy facility with a person of \n31 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 32 of 65 PageID #:2831\n \nthe opposite sex, who was authorized to access that facility under the Compelled \nAffirmation Policy, imply bigotry, ignorance, and a lack of education on behalf of the \nobjector. \n176.  Because  of  the  District’s  message  that  differing  views  will  not  be \ntolerated, few SPP Students have sought to use a single-user privacy facility, lest \nthey be viewed as bigoted, ignorant, or uneducated. \n177.  SPP Girls and SPP Boys have been denied their reasonable expectation \nof privacy from the opposite sex consequent to the Compelled Affirmation Policy, and \nare daily at risk of having their multi-user privacy facilities compromised by an \nopposite-sex student accessing the facility. \nPrivacy risks related to restroom use. \n178.  District students have a reasonable expectation of privacy from the \nopposite sex within a multi-user restroom whether they are in the common area of a \nrestroom, using a urinal, or using a commode stall. \n179.  In male facilities, wall-mounted urinals increase the risk of exposure of \ngenitalia to other users of multi-user privacy facilities as compared to a commode \nstall. \n180.  Using a commode stall does not provide full privacy, as in both the boys’ \nand girls’ restrooms, there are gaps above and below the stall doors, and gaps along \nthe sides of the door allowing those outside the stall to see into the stall, whether \npurposefully or inadvertently. Thus, there is an ongoing risk of unconsented exposure \nto  the  other  sex  when  the  stall  occupant  is  fully  or  partially  disrobed  and/or \nconducting personal hygiene. \n32 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 33 of 65 PageID #:2832\n \n181.  Commode stalls enclose commodes and are inherently less suitable for \nchanging than a dedicated changing stall: commode stalls are less sanitary, more \ncramped (posing physical safety risks), and have a built-in water hazard that may \nsoak clothing or swallow dropped personal items. \n182.  Even when using a commode or changing stall within a multi-user \nprivacy facility, a District student retains their reasonable expectation of privacy that \na member of the opposite sex will not enter that facility. \nALLEGATIONS OF LAW \n183.  Defendant District is responsible for the adoption, implementation, and \nenforcement of its Compelled Affirmation Policy and its predecessor policies within \nits schools. \n184.   Defendant District is responsible for the enforcement of its policies by \nits Superintendent, administrators, teachers, and other of its agents and employees. \n185.  The  District  has  authority  to  terminate  or  amend  the  Compelled \nAffirmation Policy. \n186.  No  federal  law  obligates  the  District  to  maintain  the  Compelled \nAffirmation Policy insofar as it regulates access to multi-user privacy facilities. \n187.  No  state  law  obligates  the  District  to  maintain  the  Compelled \nAffirmation Policy insofar as it regulates access to multi-user privacy facilities. \n188.  Despite being on notice of the harassing environment and aware of \nspecific  instances  of  harassment,  the  District  has  not  amended  the  Compelled \nAffirmation Policy to eliminate the harassing environment. \n33 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 34 of 65 PageID #:2833\n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX \n189.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 188 and \nincorporate them herein. \n190.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n191.  Title IX implementing regulations further explain in relevant part that \n“no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular . . \n. or other education program or activity operated by a recipient which receives \nFederal financial assistance.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a). \n192.  The District receives federal funding that brings it under the coverage \nof Title IX. \n193.  The  provision  of  privacy  facilities  to  protect  students’  reasonable \nexpectation of privacy from the opposite sex is one of the District’s educational \nprograms, activities, benefits, or services. \n194.  For the Fiscal Year beginning July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2018, \nthe District was budgeted to receive approximately $6,955,000 in federal aid. \n195.  Courts  have  given  Title  IX  broad  effect  in  order  to  combat  sex \ndiscrimination in the educational setting. \n34 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 35 of 65 PageID #:2834\n \n196.  There is a private cause of action against the District available under \nTitle IX. \n197.  There  is  no  requirement  that  a  claimant  exhaust  administrative \nremedies before bringing a Title IX cause of action. \n198.  The Title IX implementing regulations provide that \na [funding] recipient shall not, on the basis of sex: 1) Treat one \nperson differently from another in determining whether  such \nperson satisfies any requirement or condition for the provision of \nsuch aid, benefit, or service; 2) Provide different aid, benefits, or \nservices or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different manner; \n3) Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service; 4) Subject \nany person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or \nother treatment; . . . [or] 7) Otherwise limit any person in the \nenjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity. \n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(b). \n199.  Title IX states that “nothing contained herein shall be construed to \nprohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this Act, from maintaining \nseparate living facilities for the different sexes[,]” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, indicating that \nCongress intended that Title IX should respect student privacy rights, and not violate \nthem by compelling introduction of students of one sex into private areas designated \nfor one sex. \n200.  Title  IX’s  implementing  regulations  authorize  schools  to  “provide \nseparate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, [as long as] such \nfacilities provided for students of one sex [are] comparable to such facilities provided \nfor students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n201.  Federal regulation 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 does not authorize the District to \nmaintain separate multi-user privacy facilities for each gender. \n35 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 36 of 65 PageID #:2835\n \n202.  Federal regulation 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 does not authorize the District to \nregulate access to multi-user privacy facilities based upon a student’s gender. \n203.  Federal regulation 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 authorizes the District to regulate \naccess to multi-user privacy facilities based upon a student’s sex. \n204.  Similarly, Illinois permits the District to discriminate on the basis of sex \nin multi-user privacy facilities by expressly exempting distinctly private facilities \nfrom coverage by its Illinois Human Rights Act (IHRA).6 \n205.  The foregoing statutory and regulatory provisions are consistent with \nthe holding in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996), in which the Supreme \nCourt instructed that while the two sexes may be appropriately integrated within a \nstudent body, it is “undoubtedly . . . necessary to afford members of each sex privacy \nfrom the other sex in living arrangements. . . .” Id. at 550 n.19. \n206.  The term “sex” in Title IX and its implementing regulations means male \nor female, as grounded in the fact that humans reproduce sexually. \n207.  Sexual reproduction in humans requires a male and a female to each \ncontribute their sex-specific gametes to form a zygote. \n208.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy violates Title IX because it creates \nongoing risks, and has resulted in actual instances, of exposure to the other sex within \nmulti-user facilities reserved for either male or female use. \n                                            \n6 The IHRA deems public schools to be public accommodations at 775 ILCS 5/5-101(A)(11) \nand requires that schools not deny access to facilities under 775 ILCS 5/5-102.2. While the \nIHRA expressly protects gender identity under sections 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A) and 775 ILCS \n5/1-103(O-1), distinctly private facilities such as the locker rooms, rest rooms, and showers \nare expressly excluded from coverage by the IHRA. 775 ILCS 5/5-103(B). \n36 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 37 of 65 PageID #:2836\n \n209.  The elements of a Title IX claim are \na.  plaintiff belongs to a protected group; \nb.  plaintiff was subjected to harassment; \nc.  the harassment was based on sex; \nd.  the harassment was so pervasive, or alternatively is so severe, \nthat it altered the conditions of plaintiff's education; and \ne.  knowledge of the harassment by school officials. \n210.  The SPP Students satisfy all five elements. \nSPP Students are a protected group. \n211.  The SPP Students belong to a protected group because they are students \nat an educational institution that receives federal financial assistance.  \nSPP Students were and are being harassed. \n212.  The SPP Students are subjected to harassment because the Compelled \nAffirmation Policy authorizes males to use female multi-user privacy facilities and \nfemales to use male multi-user privacy facilities. The risk and actual instances of \nexposure  to  the  opposite  sex  within  multi-user  privacy  facilities  cause \nembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and \nloss of dignity in SPP members who access the facility for the lawful purpose of \nprotecting their privacy from the opposite sex. \n213.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy violates the SPP Students’ reasonable \nexpectation  of  privacy  from  the  opposite  sex  in  all  District  multi-user  privacy \nfacilities. \n   \n37 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 38 of 65 PageID #:2837\n \n214.  The following are some of the impacts on SPP Students: \na.  Pursuant to the Locker Room Agreement, Student A gained \naccess to all Fremd girls’ locker rooms: the PE locker room \nnear the main gymnasium; the gymnastics locker room (which \nalso served other sports); and the swim locker room near the \npool. \nb.  One  female  student,  who  had  been  previously  sexually \nassaulted,  was  initially  exposed  to  Student  A’s  genitalia \nwithin a girls’ locker room in January, 2014. \nc.  Despite notice of the initial incident and subsequent events, \nthe District failed to properly investigate or remediate the \nsituation. \nd.  The  initial  exposure,  and  subsequent  similar  incidents, \ntraumatized the girl, who committed suicide in 2017. \ne.  The Fremd girls’ PE locker room is long and rectangular, with \nbanks of lockers in the middle and along its periphery. \nf.  Approximately 130 PE students change for each PE class, \nabout 65 of whom are girls. \ng.  Students are allocated approximately 5 minutes of PE class \ntime to change before and after class, in addition to the 5 \nminutes that are allowed between classes. \n38 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 39 of 65 PageID #:2838\n \nh.  During Student A’s tenure in the Fremd girls’ locker room \nunder  the  Locker  Room  Agreement,  one  SPP  Girl  began \nwearing her gym clothes underneath her regular clothes to \navoid actually undressing in the locker room—which left her \nwearing soiled, sweaty gym clothes underneath her regular \nclothes for the balance of the day. \ni.  During Student A’s tenure in the Fremd PE locker room under \nthe Locker Room Agreement, one SPP Girl sought privacy by \nusing one of five available changing stalls. \nj.  While using the stall, other girls in the locker room began \ncalling her names such as “transphobic” and “homophobic.” \nk.  She was thereafter harassed in the hallways as other students \nyelled derogatory slang words for female body parts at her, \nand accused her of being transphobic or homophobic. \nl.  Intimidated by this experience, she has not tried to use a \nchanging  stall  again,  but  rather  resorted  to  wearing  gym \nclothes underneath her regular clothes as described above. \nm.  Word of the incident spread, and few students will brave the \nrisk of such harassment to use the changing stalls. \nn.  Even absent harassment for using the changing stalls, the \nstalls are not adequate alternatives to protect privacy to the \nPE locker room. \n39 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 40 of 65 PageID #:2839\n \no.  There are too few changing stalls to provide privacy for all of \nthe girls who are changing clothes before and after gym class. \np.  The stalls are located within the room’s common area where \ndozens of girls will be changing their clothes before or after PE \nclass. Therefore, if a female-identifying male student is in the \ncommon area, a female desiring to use a stall will have to pass \nthrough the area where the male is changing, and the reverse \nwould be true: a male student seeking to access a stall would \nhave to walk through the roomful of girls in various states of \nundress. \nq.  The  stall  doors  have  gaps  above  and  below  them,  with \nadditional gaps along the sides of the door. These gaps render \nthe stall less than fully private from viewing, or being viewed \nby, other students. \nr.  The girls’ gymnastic locker room at Fremd is small and open, \nwith a few banks of lockers and an open shower area with two \ngang shower poles. \ns.  Girls in the Fremd girls’ gymnastic locker room must change \nin the open, within view of one another. \nt.  There are no changing stalls in the girls’ gymnastic locker \nroom. \n40 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 41 of 65 PageID #:2840\n \nu.  SPP Girls who take part in gymnastics must strip down to \nchange  into  leotards,  which  at  times  results  in  exposing \nundergarments or intimate parts to others in the locker room. \nv.  The girls’ gymnastics locker room is also used by participants \nin a number of extracurricular activities and sports. \nw.  SPP Girls currently participate in some of the extracurricular \nsports and change in the girls’ gymnastic locker room for those \nactivities. \nx.  Under the Compelled Affirmation Policy, a male student may \ngain access to the gymnastic locker room for extracurricular \nsports. \ny.  At least one SPP Girl is currently enrolled in swim class at \nFremd. \nz.  That student is fearful, uncomfortable, and apprehensive to be \nchanging for swim class; changing clothes for PE class, or \nattending to feminine hygiene needs in restrooms when a male \nmay be present or enter at any time. \naa.  Swimming is a required part of PE class for District freshman \nand sophomore students, and junior and senior students may \ntake elective swim classes. \n41 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 42 of 65 PageID #:2841\n \nbb.  The Fremd girls’ swim locker room consists of a common area \nwith lockers in the middle and mirrors, shelves, dryers, and \nbenches along the periphery of the room. \ncc.  There are no private changing stalls in the Fremd girls’ swim \nlocker room, so girls changing for swim class or other activities \ninvolving the pool must either. \ni.  change  into  and  out  of  their  swimsuits  in  the \ncommon area while their classmates are changing; \nii.  use the single handicapped accessible shower stall \nthat has a curtain; or \niii.  change in a commode stall. \ndd.  SPP Girls in swimming activities must fully disrobe at some \npoint so as to change into or out of their swimsuits. \nee.  Many girls, including SPP Girls in swim class, shower after \nswimming. \nff.  When showering after swimming, some girls pull the top half \nof their bathing suits down to their waists in an effort to rinse \noff the chlorinated pool water. \ngg.  Showering takes place in open showers that are visible to \nother students in the locker room. \n42 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 43 of 65 PageID #:2842\n \nhh.  The District does not prohibit students who are not taking \nswim class or other swimming activities from accessing the \nswim locker room. \nii.  While the Locker Room Agreement was in effect, Student A \nwas authorized to access the Fremd girls’ swim locker room at \nany time. \njj.  While the Locker Room Agreement was in effect, some SPP \nGirls repeatedly encountered Student A when they used the \nFremd girls’ restrooms, up to four times in a week. \nkk.  Using a commode stall does not resolve the privacy issue as \nset forth in ¶¶ 180-182. \nll.  Consequent to Student A’s use of girls’ restrooms, some SPP \nGirls used the girls’ restrooms as little as possible to avoid \nencountering a male in the facility. \nmm.  Failing to timely urinate increases the risk of various health \nconditions including urinary tract infections, dehydration, and \nconstipation in both males and females. \nnn.  One or more SPP Girls use the restroom during class time to \nreduce the risk of encountering a member of the opposite sex \nin the facility. \n43 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 44 of 65 PageID #:2843\n \noo.  One or more SPP Girls use the restroom during class time to \nreduce the risk of being tardy entailed by trying to find a male-\nfree facility in the limited time available between classes. \npp.  Similar events are playing out at Palatine High School, where \none or more SPP Girls attend and are enrolled in mandatory \nPE classes that include a required swimming component. \nqq.  The SPP Girls use the girls PE locker room to change into gym \nclothes for PE class, and into swimsuits when swimming is \nscheduled. \nrr.  On November 30, 2017, Nova Maday, an adult male senior \nstudent at Palatine who claims a feminine gender, sued the \nDistrict to gain unrestricted access to the girls’ PE locker \nroom. \nss.  Maday was already authorized to access the girls’ locker rooms \npursuant  to  the  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy,  subject  to \nMaday taking additional privacy measures should he change \nclothes in the locker room.7 \n                                            \n7 Although the Compelled Affirmation Policy authorized Maday (aka “N.S.”) access to the \ngirls’ PE locker room subject to taking some additional privacy measures such as changing \nbehind a screen or in a stall, he unsuccessfully pursued a complaint, In re N.S., a minor, and \nTownship High School District 211, Charge No. 2017 CP 0498, with the Illinois Department \nof Human Rights (“IDHR”) to obtain unrestricted access to the Palatine girls’ locker rooms. \nThe complaint was denied for lack of evidence to substantiate his claim. See Exhibit E \n(complainant’s letter transmitting charge); Exhibit F (Charge of Discrimination filed on \nbehalf of N.S.); Exhibit G (IDHR’s Investigation Report); and Exhibit H (IDHR’s Notice of \nDismissal for Lack of Substantial Evidence). On November 30, 2017, Maday filed Nova \nMaday v. Township High School District 211, No. 17 CH 15791, in the Circuit Court of Cook \n44 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 45 of 65 PageID #:2844\n \ntt.  No District policy prohibits Maday from accessing the girls’ \nlocker rooms for purposes other than changing clothes. \nuu.  One female SPP Student at Palatine participates in after-\nschool sports and regularly uses the girls’ PE locker room to \nchange for those activities. \n215.  Thus, just as it has at Fremd, the Compelled Affirmation Policy operates \nto deny girls at Palatine their reasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex \nand they are at constant risk of opposite-sex students entering their multi-user \nprivacy facilities. \n216.  The consequence of the foregoing impacts resulting from the District \nenforcing the Compelled Affirmation Policy is that SPP Girls at Palatine suffer \nembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress degradation, and \nloss of dignity. \n217.  In respect to sexual harassment, District Board Policy JFJK/GBMB \nProhibition of Sexual Harassment (last revised Nov. 12, 1998) states that \n[a]lthough harassment may take many different forms, examples \ninclude  name-calling  and  other  derogatory  comments,  jokes, \ngestures, posting or distribution of derogatory pictures, notes or \ngraffiti  and  pushing  or  hitting  or  other  forms  of  physical \naggression.  Sexual  harassment  may  also  include  persistent \n                                            \nCounty, Illinois, Chancery Division. In that suit, Maday raised a single claim of gender \nidentity discrimination under the Illinois Human Rights Act (“IHRA”), and again demands \nunrestricted access to the girls’ locker rooms. Exhibit I (Maday Complaint). Upon learning of \nthe Maday Complaint, SPP successfully moved to intervene and lodged a motion to dismiss \nbecause distinctly private facilities such as the girls’ locker room are excluded from coverage \nby the IHRA. Exhibit J (Maday MTD). On January 25, 2018, the Cook County Circuit Court \ndenied Maday’s motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that the IHRA did not mandate \n“full and equal” access in the context of privacy facilities. Exhibit K (MPI Order). SPP’s \nmotion to dismiss is pending, with a status conference scheduled for February 22, 2018. \n45 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 46 of 65 PageID #:2845\n \nunwelcome  attempts  to  interact  with  someone,  spreading  of \nrumors of a sexual nature, and aggressive physical contact such \nas kissing, touching, or pulling at clothes in a sexual way. \nThe terms “intimidating”, “hostile”, or “offensive” include, but are \nnot  limited  to,  conduct  which  has  the  effect  of  humiliation, \nembarrassment or discomfort. \n218.  By  the  District’s  own  standards,  the  intentional  violation  of  SPP \nStudents’ reasonable expectation of privacy; the constant and continuing risk of \nopposite-sex exposure; the intimidation of SPP Students by third parties when they \nattempted  to  protect  their  privacy;  and  the  repeated  instances  of  exposure  to \nmembers of the opposite sex within their multi-user privacy facilities results in sexual \nharassment of SPP Students. \n219.  Rather than protect the SPP Students’ reasonable expectation of privacy \nfrom the opposite sex, District officials instead direct SPP Students to leave the \nfacility if they wish to have their privacy protected. \n220.  By  being  directed  to  leave  the  facility  to  protect  their  privacy,  the \nDistrict  is  violating  the  unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine  and  engaging  in \nretaliation. \n221.  The foregoing facts establish sexual harassment and a hostile sexual \nenvironment under Title IX. \nThe harassment is based on SPP Students’ sex. \n222.  The harassment is based on sex: \na.  The reason that a female student who claims a masculine \ngender (i.e., asserts that she is male) pursues access to a male \nprivacy facility is to affirm that student’s claimed gender. \n46 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 47 of 65 PageID #:2846\n \nb.  For that female student, accessing a female privacy facility \nwould not affirm the student’s claimed gender. \nc.  The reason that a male student who claims a feminine gender \n(i.e., asserts that he is female) pursues access to a female \nprivacy facility is to affirm that student’s claimed gender. \nd.  For that male student, accessing a male privacy facility would \nnot affirm the student’s claimed gender. \n223.  Therefore, the District targets a multi-user privacy facility for access by \nthe opposite sex under the Compelled Affirmation Policy specifically because of the \nsex of the students who normally use the facility, i.e., but for the fact that females \nuse  girls’  facilities,  the  District  would  not  authorize  a  male  access  under  the \nCompelled Affirmation Policy to affirm his claimed feminine gender. \nThe harassment is pervasive. \n224.  SPP Students are subjected to the Compelled Affirmation Policy at all \ntimes that they are on campus or otherwise under the authority of the District. \n225.  SPP Students no longer have a protected reasonable expectation of \nprivacy from the opposite sex in any multi-user privacy facility within the District. \n226.  Prior to the District adopting the Locker Room Agreement, Student A \nwas able to enter girls’ locker rooms without being challenged by District staff upon \nhis entry to the facility. \n227.  The District refuses to provide any warning to SPP Students that a \nmember of one sex has been authorized to access the multi-user privacy facilities of \n47 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 48 of 65 PageID #:2847\n \nthe other sex, nor will it warn SPP Students when such a person enters the privacy \nareas. \n228.  The District refuses to take any action to protect the SPP Students’ \nreasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex within multi-user privacy \nfacilities other than telling the SPP Students that they should seek alternative \nfacilities to preserve their privacy. \nThe harassment is severe. \n229.  The  factors  that  demonstrate  pervasiveness  also  demonstrate  the \nseverity of the harassment: despite state and federal law establishing facilities to \nrespect the real physical differences between the sexes resulting from a person’s \nsexual reproductive capacity as a male or a female, SPP Students have no safe haven \nfor privacy unless they waive their constitutional bodily privacy rights and risk the \nexposure to the opposite sex within a multi-user privacy facility, or abandon the very \nfacility lawfully provided to protect their privacy from the opposite sex. \n230.  This is despite the District admitting that the anatomical differences \nbetween boys and girls are the reason for sex-separated facilities when students \nchange  or  shower  in  open  areas.  Exhibit  L  (Email  from  Daniel  E.  Cates, \nSuperintendent, Township High School District 211, to District listserv, District \nResponse to Office of Civil Rights (Nov. 2, 2015, 17:57 EST.); see also supra at ¶¶ 83, \n88 (District’s defense of students’ bodily privacy). \n231.  What is seen cannot be unseen: while monetary damages might redress \nthe embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, \nand loss of dignity that students suffer when unconsented cross-sex exposure is not \n48 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 49 of 65 PageID #:2848\n \nonly a constant risk but becomes a reality, nothing can reverse the psychological \nimpacts of adolescents being exposed to members of the opposite sex in a state of \nundress or when conducting extremely personal hygiene matters. \n232.  A female’s bodily privacy is hers and hers alone. Unconsented exposure \nto the opposite sex within privacy facilities is not mitigated by what that member of \nthe opposite sex is thinking. \n233.  A male’s bodily privacy is his and his alone. Unconsented exposure to \nthe opposite sex within privacy facilities is not mitigated by what that member of the \nopposite sex is thinking. \n234.  A person’s perception of his or her gender does not in itself alter his or \nher primary or secondary sex characteristics. \n235.  A person’s state of mind cannot alter his or her genetic complement. \n236.  Although authorized by law to do so, the District not only fails to protect \nthe privacy of SPP Students under Title IX, but rather intentionally violates Title IX \nby creating and enforcing its Compelled Affirmation Policy. \n237.  SPP Students thus are forced to abandon multi-user privacy facilities \nthat are lawfully provided for protecting their privacy, or waive their fundamental \nbodily privacy rights as the condition of using those facilities. \n238.  Under Title IX case law, the victim of sexual harassment is not obligated \nto self-cure the situation by foregoing educational rights and benefits, or altering the \nterms of the students’ education. \n49 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 50 of 65 PageID #:2849\n \n239.  When SPP Students have sought to preserve their privacy by seeking \nalternate facilities, they have been harassed by other students using terms that \ncharacterize the SPP Students as being transphobic or bigoted. \n240.  SPP Students have lost instructional time because the safest option \nsome have found is to ask to use the restroom during class time rather than during \nscheduled breaks, so as to minimize the risk of being exposed to the opposite sex \nconsequent to the Compelled Affirmation Policy. \n241.  The foregoing factors demonstrate that the harassment is sufficiently \nsevere and pervasive so as to violate Title IX. \nOfficials are on notice of the harassment. \n242.  Prior  to  and  during  the  development  of  the  Compelled  Affirmation \nPolicy, SPP Students notified District officials that privacy violations would result \nfrom intermingling the sexes in multi-user privacy facilities. \n243.  District officials have admitted that authorizing students of one sex to \naccess  multi-user  privacy  facilities  of  the  other  sex  would  infringe  upon  the \nconstitutional right to bodily privacy. \n244.  Some SPP Parents have directly notified school officials of the privacy \nviolations and sought assurances that their children would be provided protection for \ntheir privacy. \n245.  Prior  to  the  Locker  Room  Agreement  taking  effect,  some  District \nstudents and at least one parent notified the District that Student A was accessing \ngirls’ locker rooms. (V.W. Decl. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. 8, ECF No. 21-10 at \n8 of 15.) \n50 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 51 of 65 PageID #:2850\n \n246.  Ms. Wilson recounted the substance of the events leading to the suicide \nof the Fremd female student and identified the risks of opposite-sex access to multi-\nuser privacy facilities in a public school board meeting in January, 2016. \n247.  Whereas notice may be an issue in cases where students violate school \npolicies to engage in student-on-student sexual harassment, in this instance the \nsexually  harassing  conduct  among  students  results  directly  from  the  District \nintentionally  designing  the  hostile  environment  and  authorizing  the  harassing \nconduct. \n248.  SPP Students therefore satisfy every element of a Title IX violation.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: \nVIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY \n249.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 248 and \nincorporate them herein. \n250.  Fundamental rights are grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due \nProcess Clause. \n251.  They are rights that are deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and \ntradition and are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n252.  Included within those rights is the right to privacy in one’s fully or \npartially unclothed body. \n51 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 52 of 65 PageID #:2851\n \n253.  The  right  to  privacy  also  encompasses  the  right  to  be  free  from \ngovernment-enforced, unconsented risk of cross-sex exposure when either sex is \npartially or fully unclothed. \n254.  The right to be free from government-enforced, unconsented risk of \ncross-sex exposure when either sex is partially or fully unclothed is deeply rooted in \nthis Nation’s history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. \n255.  Throughout its history, American law and society has had a national \ncommitment  to  protecting  citizens,  and  especially  children,  from  unconsented \nexposure involving partial or full nudity of either sex, and protecting them when they \nare conducting personal hygiene. \n256.  Because of that national commitment, sex-specific restrooms and locker \nrooms are ubiquitous in public places. \n257.  Sex-separated privacy facilities are the norm in Illinois public schools. \n258.  The ability to be clothed in the presence of the opposite sex, along with \nthe freedom to use the restroom and locker room away from the presence of the \nopposite sex, is fundamental to most people’s sense of self-respect and personal \ndignity. \n259.  The  government  may  not  infringe  fundamental  rights,  unless  the \ninfringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires that the government \ndemonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compelling government interest in \nthe least restrictive means available. \n52 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 53 of 65 PageID #:2852\n \n260.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy authorizes male students who claim \na feminine gender to access female restrooms. \n261.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy authorizes female students who claim \na masculine gender to access male restrooms. \n262.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy requires the SPP Students to risk \nbeing exposed to those of the opposite sex in multi-user privacy facilities, where \nstudents are necessarily disrobing for various classes or activities and may be nude \nor semi-nude, absent the SPP Students’ consent. \n263.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy violates the SPP Students’ reasonable \nexpectation of privacy from the opposite sex within multi-user privacy facilities. \n264.  The  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  infringes  the  SPP  Students’ \nfundamental right to privacy in their unclothed bodies, as well as their fundamental \nright  to  be  free  from  government-compelled  risk  of  being  exposed  to  unclothed \nmembers of the opposite sex, without any compelling justification. \n265.  The District has no compelling government interest in using its privacy \nfacilities to affirm an individual student’s state of mind regarding that student’s \ngender. \n266.  The District has no compelling government interest in intermingling the \nsexes within privacy facilities lawfully established specifically to protect students’ \nreasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex. \n267.  The District has not used the least restrictive means of serving any \ninterest they may have in intermingling the sexes within multi-user privacy facilities. \n53 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 54 of 65 PageID #:2853\n \n268.  Accordingly, the Compelled Affirmation Policy fails the required strict \nscrutiny review and is unconstitutional as applied to any student, including the SPP \nStudents. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: \nVIOLATION OF PARENTS’ FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DIRECT THE \nEDUCATION AND UPBRINGING OF THEIR CHILDREN \n269.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 268 and \nincorporate them herein. \n270.  The right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and \ncontrol  of  their  children  is  a  fundamental  right  protected  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Due Process Clause. \n271.  Included within that fundamental parental right is the power to direct \nthe education and upbringing of one’s children. \n272.  Parents hold a fundamental right to instill moral standards and values \nin their children. \n273.  Parents’ right to instill moral standards and values in their children, \nand to direct their education and upbringing, encompasses the right to determine \nwhether, and when, their minor children endure the risk of being exposed to members \nof the opposite sex in privacy facilities. \n274.  Parents have a fundamental right to determine whether their children \nwill have to risk being exposed to the undressed or partially clothed bodies of the \nopposite sex while at school, and a fundamental right to determine whether their \n54 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 55 of 65 PageID #:2854\n \nchildren, while at school, will have to risk exposing their own undressed or partially \nunclothed bodies to members of the opposite sex. \n275.  The District lacks authority under the in loco parentis doctrine to decide \nwhen to put children under its care at risk of unconsented exposure to the opposite \nsex when either sex is fully or partially unclothed or is conducting personal hygiene. \n276.  All SPP Parents adamantly and conscientiously hold moral objections to \ntheir children using multi-user privacy facilities when a member of the other sex is \npresent within the facility. \n277.  All SPP Parents do not want their children to view a student of the other \nsex while that student is in a state of undress. \n278.  All SPP Parents do not want their children’s bodies to be exposed to a \nstudent of the other sex while naked or otherwise in a state of undress, nor do they \nwant their children to attend to their personal hygiene in the presence of the other \nsex while their children are under the District’s control. \n279.  When some SPP Parents requested a private locker room facility for \ntheir daughters, the Fremd Principal told them that their daughters could use the \nstalls in the PE locker room, the swimming or athletic locker rooms, or the nurses’ \noffice. \n280.  None of these were or are acceptable alternatives: \na.  Commode stalls are not an adequate alternative as set forth \nat ¶¶ 180-182. \n55 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 56 of 65 PageID #:2855\n \nb.  The changing stalls in the PE locker room are not an adequate \nalternative as set forth at ¶¶ 214(n)-(q). \nc.  The swimming and gymnastics locker rooms are not adequate \nalternatives because Student A was authorized to access them \nat all times, and any male student who claims a feminine \ngender currently may access them at any time, including when \nthe SPP Girls use them to change clothes. \nd.  Even  were  the  swim  or  gymnastics  locker  rooms  viable \nalternatives (i.e., off limits to males), in which girls could \nchange for PE class, SPP Girls would have to go pick up their \ngym clothes from the PE locker room, retire to the alternative \nfacility (each of which is some distance away), then return to \nthe PE locker room, drop off their regular clothes, attend class, \nthen repeat the process in reverse at the end of class. \n281.  In response to the request for a private restroom facility, the Fremd \nPrincipal told some SPP Parents that if their daughters walk into a multi-user \nrestroom when a male student is present, their daughters’ option is to leave the \nfacility and use a different restroom in the school. \n282.  This suggested solution is not acceptable for several reasons: \na.  It obligates the students to self-cure the District’s intentional \nintermingling of the sexes within a facility that is reserved for \nthe use of girls under state and federal law. \n56 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 57 of 65 PageID #:2856\n \nb.  Seeking an alternative facility is not feasible when a male \nenters the restroom after a girl has already begun using the \nfacility, a situation that is exacerbated because the District \nrefuses to give any advance notice that a male student has \nbeen authorized to access the facility. \nc.  Similarly, a girl who urgently needs to use the facility may not \nhave time to reach a single-user facility, even if it is nearby. \nd.  In  some  instances,  even  were  a  girl  to  seek  a  single-user \nfacility, some restrooms are so distant from an alternative \nfacility that SPP Girls could not access the facility within the \nfive minutes allowed between classes. \ne.  At Fremd the issue is exacerbated in the music wing and \napplied technology wing, as both wings lack restrooms. \n283.   SPP Boys are at no less risk of having their reasonable expectation of \nprivacy violated by the District enforcing the Compelled Affirmation Policy: as with \nSPP Girls, a member of the opposite sex can appear at any time, on any campus, in \nany multi-user privacy facility that is lawfully reserved to male use only. \n284.  Because of the Compelled Affirmation Policy, at least one SPP Parent \nsent his daughter to private school, instead of a District school, after she had attended \nFremd in the 2016-17 school year. \n57 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 58 of 65 PageID #:2857\n \n285.  The  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy,  instituted  and  enforced  by  the \nDefendants, make it impossible for the SPP Parents to direct the upbringing and \neducation of their children. \n286.  Accordingly,  the  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  infringes  the  SPP \nParents’ fundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children. \n287.  Defendants may not infringe fundamental rights, including parents’ \nfundamental right to direct the education and upbringing of their children, unless \nthe infringement satisfies strict scrutiny review, which requires that Defendants \ndemonstrate that the law or regulation furthers a compelling government interest in \nthe least restrictive manner available. \n288.  The District has no compelling government interest in using its privacy \nfacilities to affirm an individual student’s state of mind regarding that student’s \ngender. \n289.  The District has no compelling government interest in intermingling the \nsexes within privacy facilities lawfully established specifically to protect students’ \nreasonable expectation of privacy from the opposite sex. \n290.  The District has not used the least restrictive means of serving any legal \ninterest they may have. \n291.  Accordingly,  the  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  fails  strict  scrutiny \nreview and is an unconstitutional infringement on parents’ fundamental right to \ndirect the education and upbringing of their children. \n   \n58 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 59 of 65 PageID #:2858\n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: \nVIOLATION OF THE \nILLINOIS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT \n292.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 291 and \nincorporate them herein. \n293.  The Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) provides in \npertinent part: \nGovernment may not substantially burden a person’s exercise of \nreligion,  even  if  the  burden  results  from  a  rule  of  general \napplicability,  unless  it  demonstrates  that  application  of  the \nburden  to  the  person  (i)  is  in  furtherance  of  a  compelling \ngovernmental interest and (ii) is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering that compelling governmental interest. \n775 ILCS 35/15. \n294.   Many  of the  SPP Students hold  strong  religious  tenets to  practice \npersonal modesty. These students have the sincere religious belief that they must not \nundress, or use the restroom, in the presence of the opposite sex, and also that they \nmust not be in the presence of the opposite sex while the opposite sex is undressing \nor using the restroom. \n295.  Many of the SPP Parents have the sincere religious belief that they must \nteach their children to practice modesty in respect to the opposite sex. Their religious \nfaith also requires them to protect the modesty of their children. These parents have \nthe sincere religious belief that their children must not undress, or use the restroom, \nin the presence of a member of the opposite sex, and that they must not be in the \n59 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 60 of 65 PageID #:2859\n \npresence  of  the  opposite  sex  while  the  opposite  sex  is  undressing  or  using  the \nrestroom. \n296.   The Compelled Affirmation Policy prevents the SPP Students from \npracticing the modesty that their faith requires of them. \n297.  The  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  contradicts  the  SPP  Parents’ \nsincerely-held religious beliefs relative to teaching their children sexual modesty \nconsistent with their religious beliefs. \n298.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy inhibits the SPP Parents’ ability to \nset standards for their children’s behavior in respect to sexual modesty that are \nconsistent with their religious beliefs. \n299.  Complying with the requirements of the Compelled Affirmation Policy \nthus places a substantial burden on the SPP Parents’ and Students’ exercise of \nreligion. \n300.  It is a substantial burden to require SPP Parents and Students to choose \nbetween the benefit of a free public education and violating their religious beliefs. \n301.  The District has no compelling government interest that would justify \nburdening the SPP Parents’ and Students’ exercise of religion in this manner. \n302.  Additionally, the District has not used the least restrictive means to \nachieve its purported interest in burdening the SPP Parents’ and Students’ exercise \nof religion in this manner. \n303.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy accordingly violates the SPP Parents’ \nand Students’ rights under the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n60 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 61 of 65 PageID #:2860\n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION: \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT’S GUARANTEE OF  \nFREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION \n304.  Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth in paragraphs 1 through 303 and \nincorporate them herein. \n305.  The  First  Amendment  provides  that  Congress  shall  make  no  law \nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. \n306.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy burdens the free exercise rights of \nsome of the SPP Parents and Students. See supra, Fourth Cause of Action. \n307.  Laws  that  burden  free  exercise,  but  are  not  neutral  or  generally \napplicable, are presumptively unconstitutional under strict scrutiny. \n308.  The Compelled Affirmation Policy is not generally applicable because it \ndoes not allow all students to use the opposite-sex restrooms, but only students who \nclaim to have a gender discordant with their sex. \n309.  The predecessor Restroom Policy was not generally applicable. \n310.  The Locker Room Agreement applied only to one student, Student A. \n311.  The Locker Room Agreement did not apply to all students, allowing \nthem to access whichever locker or shower rooms they requested. \n312.  The Locker Room Agreement did not apply to all students who claim a \ngender that is discordant with their sex. \n61 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 62 of 65 PageID #:2861\n \n313.  Because the Compelled Affirmation Policy and its predecessor policies \nwere and are not generally applicable, they are subject to strict scrutiny, which they \nfail. See supra, Second and Third Causes of Action.  \n314.  Additionally,  the  Compelled  Affirmation  Policy  is  subject  to  strict \nscrutiny under hybrid rights principles because it burdens free exercise rights in \ncombination  with  bodily  privacy  rights  and  parental  rights  and  is  therefore \npresumptively unconstitutional under strict scrutiny.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set \nforth hereinafter in the Prayer for Relief. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for judgment as follows and \nrequest the following relief: \nA.  That this Court enter a declaratory judgment declaring that as applied \nto Plaintiffs, the Compelled Affirmation Policy violates Title IX by creating a sexually \nhostile environment and results in sexual harassment; violates the SPP Students’ \nconstitutional  right  to  privacy;  impermissibly  burdens  the  SPP  Parents’ \nconstitutional right to direct the upbringing and education of their children; violates \nthe rights of some of the SPP Students and Parents under the Illinois Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act; and violates the constitutional guarantee to free exercise \nof religion for some of the SPP Students and Parents under the Free Exercise Clause. \nB.  That this Court enter a declaratory judgment declaring that on its face, \nthe Compelled Affirmation Policy violates Title IX by creating a sexually hostile \nenvironment and results in sexual harassment; violates the constitutional right to \n62 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 63 of 65 PageID #:2862\n \nprivacy; impermissibly burdens the SPP Parents’ constitutional right to direct the \nupbringing and education of their children; violates the rights of some of the SPP \nStudents and Parents under the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act; and \nviolates the constitutional guarantee to free exercise of religion for some of the SPP \nStudents and Parents under the Free Exercise Clause. \nC.  That this Court permanently enjoin Defendants, their officers, agents, \nemployees, and all other persons acting in concert with them, from enforcing the \nCompelled Affirmation Policy insofar as it may authorize any student of one sex to \naccess the multi-user privacy facilities of the other sex; \nD.  That this Court award nominal damages in the amount of one hundred, \nthirty-six ($136)8 dollars for the violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory \nrights; \nE.  That this Court retain jurisdiction of this matter for the purpose of \nenforcing any Orders; \nF.  That  this Court award  Plaintiffs costs  and  expenses  of this  action, \nincluding a reasonable attorneys’ fees award, in accordance with 775 ILCS 35/20, 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412, and 42 U.S.C § 1988; \nG.  That this Court issue the requested injunctive relief without a condition \nof bond or other security being required of Plaintiffs; and \nH.  That this Court grant such other and further relief as the Court deems \nequitable and just in the circumstances. \n                                            \n8 That would equate to a ceremonial award of one dollar to each original SPP member. \n63 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 197 Filed: 02/15/18 Page 64 of 65 PageID #:2863\n \nRespectfully submitted this 15th day of February, 2018. \n \n            By: /s/ Gary S.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n  Plaintiffs  Students  and  Parents  for  Privacy,  an  unincorporated  association,  and  five \ncurrent or prospective high school students who live in suburban Cook County, Illinois, by and \nthrough their parents and legal guardians, (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) have filed a Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction that, if granted, would require Defendant School Directors of Township \nHigh School District 211 (“District 211” or “the District”) to segregate restrooms and locker \nrooms on the basis of students’ biological sex (which Plaintiffs consider to be sex assigned at \nbirth).  Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin a rule, adopted by Defendant United States Department of \nEducation (“DOE”) and enforced in conjunction with Defendant United States Department of \nJustice (“DOJ”) (together with the Secretary of Education and the Attorney General, collectively \n“the Federal Defendants”), that requires all schools in the United States to allow students to use \nrestrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity.  Last, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin \nthe  District’s  policy,  implemented  in  August  2013,  allowing  transgender  students  to  use \nrestrooms consistent with their gender identity, and an agreement DOE entered into with District \n211 in December 2015 in which the District agreed to allow Student A, a transgender girl, to use \nthe girls’ locker rooms at William Fremd High School (“Fremd High School”), a public high \nschool in Palatine, Illinois.   \n  District Judge Jorge Alonso referred Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction to this \nMagistrate Judge for a Report and Recommendation as to whether it should be granted or denied.  \nA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy.  Granting a preliminary injunction in this \ncase would change the status quo before a full determination on the merits of the claims and \ndefenses raised in the lawsuit.  Preliminary injunctive relief is granted only when the moving \nparties—here, Plaintiffs—make a clear showing that they have a likelihood of success on the \n2 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 3 of 82 PageID #:1816\nmerits of their claims, they likely will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not issued \npending a final determination of the matters at issue, and they lack an adequate remedy at law.  If \nthe moving parties make these three threshold showings, then they still must show, on balance, \nthat they will suffer more harm if an injunction is not issued than the non-moving parties will \nsuffer if it is issued, and that the public interest would be served by the issuance of an injunction.  \n  The Court finds Plaintiffs have not shown they have a likelihood of success on the merits \nof their claim that DOE violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 500 et \nseq., by promulgating a rule that interprets Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n(“Title IX”), 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., to require that schools permit transgender students to use \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms  consistent  with  their  gender  identity,  and  by  entering  into  an \nagreement informed by that rule with District 211 under which the District is required to allow \nStudent A to use the girls’ locker rooms at Fremd High School.  The law in the Seventh Circuit \nconcerning the meaning of the term “sex” as used in Title IX may be in flux.  Just last week, the \nSeventh Circuit vacated a decision by a panel of that court that adhered to a longstanding \ninterpretation of the word “sex” in the almost identically worded Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., as very narrow, traditional and biological.  \nPlaintiffs relied heavily on the now vacated panel decision.  The full court of appeals agreed to \nrehear that case next month.  Recent rulings by courts around the country including a district \ncourt in the Seventh Circuit evince a trend toward a more expansive understanding of sex in Title \nIX  as  inclusive  of  gender  identity.    Therefore,  the  Court  cannot  say  with  confidence  that \nPlaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that DOE’s interpretation of \nTitle IX is not in accordance with law or entitled to deference.   \n3 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 4 of 82 PageID #:1817\n  The Court also finds Plaintiffs have not shown they have a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their claim that District 211 or the Federal Defendants are violating their right to \nprivacy under the United States Constitution or that District 211 is violating Title IX because \ntransgender students are permitted to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity and \nStudent A is allowed to use the girls’ locker rooms at Fremd High School.  High school students \ndo not have a constitutional right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender \nstudents whose sex assigned at birth is different than theirs.  In addition, sharing a restroom or \nlocker room with a transgender student does  not create a severe, pervasive, or objectively \noffensive hostile environment under Title IX given the privacy protections District 211 has put in \nplace in those facilities and the alternative facilities available to students who do not want to \nshare a restroom or locker room with a transgender student. Further, the facilities District 211 \nprovides for its male and female students are comparable as is required by Title IX.   \n  In addition, even if Plaintiffs were able to show they have a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their claims, they still would not be entitled to the injunctive relief they seek.  Plaintiffs \nhave  not  shown  they  are  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  if  the  District’s  or  the  Federal \nDefendants’ actions are not enjoined.  Plaintiffs also have not shown they lack an adequate \nremedy at law against either District 211 or the Federal Defendants if they ultimately succeed on \ntheir claims.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not made the three required threshold showings at this \nearly stage of the case that the law requires to change the status quo before a final decision on the \nparties’ claims and defenses.   \n  For all of these reasons, there is no legal reason why District 211 cannot continue to \npermit all students to use restrooms and Student A to use locker rooms consistent with their \ngender identity while this case proceeds.  As discussed more fully below, District 211 balanced \n4 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 5 of 82 PageID #:1818\nthe interests of all its students when it decided to permit transgender students to use restrooms \nconsistent with their gender identity and to allow Student A to use the girls’ locker rooms at her \nhigh school.  Although the District decided to allow Student A to use the girls’ locker rooms \nunder threat of an enforcement action by DOE, it nevertheless agreed to resolve that action rather \nthan litigate the issue, and it defends its decision to do so in this case.  District 211 now offers all \nstudents reasonable accommodations to ensure their privacy is protected in restrooms and locker \nrooms.  In addition, the District has made clear that any cisgender high school student who does \nnot want to use a restroom or a locker room with a transgender student is not required to do so.   \n  Accordingly, this Court respectfully recommends to Judge Alonso that Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction be denied.   \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.    Events That Preceded This Lawsuit \n  In  August  2013,  District  211  began  allowing  transgender  students  to  use  restrooms \nconsistent with their gender identity (“the Restroom Policy”).  Verified Complaint for Injunctive \nand Declaratory Relief (“Complaint”), [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 214-217].1  But it did not allow \ntransgender students to use locker rooms consistent with their gender identity.  In December \n2013, Student A, a transgender girl now in her senior year at Fremd High School, filed a \n                                                 \n1 At oral argument, District 211’s counsel pointed out that the District allows transgender students to use \nrestrooms consistent with their gender identity as a matter of practice but the District 211 Board never \nadopted a formal policy on that subject.  Transcript of August 15, 2016 Preliminary Injunction Hearing \n(“Oral Argument Transcript”), [ECF No. 127, at 68].  According to the District’s counsel, a “policy” is a \nterm of art the District uses when it takes action in an open session and adopts a formal policy.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs characterize District 211’s practice as “the Restroom Policy” in their Complaint.  See, e.g., \nComplaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 211-237].  Although the Court uses the term “Restroom Policy” in this \nReport and Recommendation to mean District 211’s practice of allowing transgender students to use \nrestrooms consistent with their gender identity, it accepts District 211’s position that the practice is not a \nformal policy adopted by the District’s Board.  It does not matter to the Court’s analysis whether the \nundisputed fact that District 211 allows transgender students to use restrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity is characterized as a practice or a policy.    \n \n5 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 6 of 82 PageID #:1819\ncomplaint with DOE’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”), alleging that District 211 was violating \nTitle IX by denying her access to the girls’ locker rooms.  Id. at ¶¶ 71-75, 80.2  \n  Title IX prohibits recipients of “Federal financial assistance” from discriminating on the \nbasis of sex in education programs and activities.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  DOE and DOJ share \nresponsibility for enforcing Title IX.  See id. at § 1681; 34 C.F.R. pt. 106; 28 C.F.R. pt. 54.  \nUnder  this  grant  of  authority,  OCR  investigates  complaints,  conducts  compliance  reviews, \npromulgates  regulations,  and  issues  guidance.    DOE’s  regulations  implementing  Title  IX \nprovide,  in  relevant  part,  that  “no  person  shall,  on  the  basis  of  sex,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any . . . \neducation  program  or  activity  operated  by  a  recipient  which  receives  Federal  financial \nassistance.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a).  The regulations permit recipients to provide sex-segregated \n“toilet, locker room, and shower facilities,” so long as “facilities provided for students of one sex \n[are] comparable to such facilities for students of the other sex.”  Id. at § 106.33.  As a recipient \nof “Federal financial assistance” from DOE, District 211 is subject to Title IX.  See 20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a). \n  In a series of guidance documents issued in 2014 and 2015 (collectively, “Guidance \nDocuments”  or  “Guidance”),  DOE  explained  how  schools  that  receive  “Federal  financial \nassistance”  should  comply  with  Title  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  with  respect  to \n                                                 \n2 Student A, who was assigned the sex of male at birth, has identified as female from a young age.  Letter \nof Findings, [ECF No. 21-10, at 2].  During her middle school years, Student A began living full-time as a \nfemale.  Id.  Since then, she has presented a female appearance and taken hormone therapy.  Id.  Student \nA also has changed her legal name and passport to reflect her gender identity.  Id.  Plaintiffs refer to \nStudent A as a biological male throughout their written filings and consistently use the masculine \npronouns “he” and “him” when referring to Student A.  The Federal Defendants, District 211, and \nIntervenor-Defendants use the feminine pronouns “she” and “her” when referring to Student A.  In this \nReport and Recommendation, the Court will identify Student A as a transgender girl and use female \npronouns when referring to her, which is consistent with Student A’s gender identity and the way she \nrefers to herself. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 7 of 82 PageID #:1820\ntransgender students.  In April 2014, in response to requests for clarification from various \nfunding  recipients,  DOE,  through  OCR,  issued  guidance  stating  that  “Title  IX’s  sex \ndiscrimination  prohibition  extends  to  claims  of  discrimination  based  on  gender  identity.”  \nQuestions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence (“Q&A on Sexual Violence”), [ECF \nNo. 21-9, at 5].  In December 2014, DOE also said that “[u]nder Title IX, a recipient generally \nmust  treat  transgender  students  consistent  with  their  gender  identity  in  all  aspects  of  the \nplanning,  implementation,  enrollment,  operation,  and  evaluation  of  single-sex  classes.”  \nQuestions and Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and \nExtracurricular Activities (“Q&A on Single-Sex Classes and Extracurricular Activities”), [ECF \nNo. 21-8, at 25].  In April 2015, DOE reiterated this interpretation, stating that recipients must \n“help ensure that transgender students are treated consistent with their gender identity in the \ncontext of single-sex classes.”  Title IX Resource Guide, [ECF No. 21-7, at 21-22].3  \n  The Guidance Documents were issued after Student A filed her complaint with OCR \nconcerning locker room access but during the time that OCR was reviewing that complaint.  \nAfter investigating Student A’s complaint, OCR notified District 211 by a letter dated November \n2, 2015—the “Letter of Findings” for short—that excluding Student A from the girls’ locker \nrooms violated Title IX’s implementing regulations.  Letter of Findings, [ECF No. 21-10, at 13].  \nThe Letter of Findings further explained that if OCR and District 211 were not able to negotiate \n                                                 \n3 Less than one week after Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this case, DOE and DOJ issued a joint \nguidance dated May 13, 2016, in the form of a “Dear Colleague Letter,” explaining that “[w]hen a school \nprovides sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students must be allowed to participate in \nsuch activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender identity.”  Dear Colleague Letter on \nTransgender Students (“Dear Colleague Letter”), [ECF No. 21-6, at 3].  Although the statements in and \nrationale for this Dear Colleague Letter are consistent with the Guidance Documents, the May 13 Dear \nColleague Letter is not among the Guidance Documents directly at issue in this case because it was issued \nafter this lawsuit was filed.   \n7 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 8 of 82 PageID #:1821\nan agreement to bring the District into compliance with its obligations, OCR would issue a Letter \nof Impending Enforcement Action.  Id.  \n  On December 2, 2015, OCR and District 211 entered into an Agreement to Resolve, \nwhich will be referred to as the “Locker Room Agreement.”  Locker Room Agreement, [ECF \nNo. 21-3].  The Locker Room Agreement provides, among other things:  \nBased on Student A’s representation that she will change in private changing \nstations in the girls’ locker rooms, the District agrees to provide Student A access \nto locker room facilities designated for female students at school and to take steps \nto protect the privacy  of its students by installing and maintaining sufficient \nprivacy curtains (private changing stations) within the girls’ locker rooms  to \naccommodate Student A and any students who wish to be assured of privacy \nwhile changing.  \n \nId. at 2.  The Locker Room Agreement further provides:  \nIf any student requests additional privacy in the use of sex-specific facilities \ndesigned  for  female  students  beyond  the  private  changing  stations  described \n[above],  the  District  will  provide  that  student  with  access  to  a  reasonable \nalternative, such as assignment of a student locker in near proximity to the office \nof a teacher or coach; use of another private area (such as a restroom stall) within \nthe public area; use of a nearby private area (such as a single-use facility); or a \nseparate schedule of use.  \n \nId.  \nB.    Plaintiffs’ Complaint In This Case \n  On May 4, 2016, a little more than five months after the Locker Room Agreement was \nsigned, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against the Federal Defendants and District 211, challenging \nthe Restroom Policy, the Locker Room Agreement, and the Guidance Documents.  Complaint, \n[ECF No. 1].4  In Count I of their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that DOE violated the APA by \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs filed a “Verified Complaint” in this case.  There is no requirement in the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure that a complaint must be verified “[u]nless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise.”  \nFED. R. CIV. P. 11(a).  The Court is unaware of any rule or statute that requires verification of a complaint \nseeking an injunction.  Although a verified complaint may be treated as an affidavit when filed in support \nof a motion seeking an injunction, Myers v. Thompson, 2016 WL 3610431, at *5 (D. Mont. June 28, \n2016), “a party’s verification of a pleading that need not have been verified does not give the pleading \n8 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 9 of 82 PageID #:1822\nentering  into  the  Locker  Room  Agreement  with  District  211  and  by  promulgating  a  rule, \nembodied in the Guidance Documents, requiring schools to treat students consistent with their \ngender identity.  In Counts II and IV respectively, Plaintiffs allege that the Federal Defendants \nand District 211 are violating Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy, and that the District is \nviolating their rights under Title IX, by allowing transgender students to use restrooms consistent \nwith their gender identity and by allowing Student A, who Plaintiffs consider to be a biological \nmale, to use the girls’ locker rooms. \n  In addition, Plaintiffs assert claims for violations of their parental right to direct the \neducation  and  upbringing  of  their  children  (Count  III);  the  Illinois  and  Federal  Religious \nFreedom  Restoration  Acts  (Counts  V  and  VI);  and  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First \nAmendment (Count VII).  Counts I and VI are against the Federal Defendants only; Counts IV \nand V are against District 211 only.  The remaining counts are against all Defendants. \n  Plaintiffs are an unincorporated association and five individually named minor plaintiffs \n(four females and one male), identified only by their initials.  Plaintiffs use the term “Girl \nPlaintiffs” to refer to “all girl students who attend Fremd, or will attend Fremd in fall 2016, and \nare  part  of  the  Students  and  Parents  for  Privacy  [including  the  four  female  minor  named \nplaintiffs].”  Id. at ¶ 36.  They use the term “Student Plaintiffs” to refer to “all students who are \npart of Students and Parents for Privacy [including the five individual minor named plaintiffs].”  \nId.5  The only individual minor plaintiff who is male is identified as B.W. in paragraph 35 of the \n                                                                                                                                                             \nany added weight or importance in the eyes of the district court,” 5A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 1339 (3d ed. 2004) (hereinafter “Wright”).  Therefore, the allegations in \nPlaintiffs’  Complaint  are  not  entitled  to  any  greater  weight  nor  are  they  insulated  from  being \ncharacterized as speculative, vague, general, or overbroad, or from being contradicted by evidence \nsubmitted by Defendants.  Id. \n \n5 The Court will use the terms “Student Plaintiffs” and “Girl Plaintiffs” as Plaintiffs have defined them.  \nIn addition, Plaintiffs refer to male and female students as boys and girls, and to the facilities at issue in \n9 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 10 of 82 PageID #:1823\nComplaint.  Plaintiffs allege B.W. is subject to the Restroom Policy but he is not referenced \nanywhere else in the Complaint.  Student Plaintiffs allege they are affected by the Restroom \nPolicy, but only Girl Plaintiffs allege they are affected by the Locker Room Agreement.  The \nonly transgender student who is alleged to have used a restroom or locker room at Fremd High \nSchool is Student A. \n  Plaintiffs  allege,  among  other  things,  the  Restroom  Policy  and  the  Locker  Room \nAgreement  cause  Girl  Plaintiffs  to  experience  “embarrassment,  humiliation,  anxiety,  fear, \napprehension, stress, degradation, and loss of dignity” because they use, and anticipate having to \nuse, restrooms and locker rooms with Student A, who they label as a “biological male.”  Id. at ¶¶ \n7, 11; see also id. at ¶ 226 (adding the word “intimidation” to the list of emotions Girl Plaintiffs \nallege  they  are  experiencing).    Plaintiffs  allege  Girl  Plaintiffs  are  afraid,  worried,  and \nembarrassed  about  the  possibility  of  seeing  or  being  seen  by  Student  A  when  either  Girl \nPlaintiffs or Student A are in a state of undress.  Id. at ¶¶ 8, 9, 114, 126, 127, 186, 187.  Plaintiffs \nassert Girl Plaintiffs’ distress is “ever-present” and “constant.”  Id. at ¶¶ 114, 115, 125, 237.  \nPlaintiffs also say Girl Plaintiffs are fearful of having to attend to personal needs in restrooms \nand locker rooms when Student A is present.  Id. at ¶¶ 8, 10.  All Student Plaintiffs allege they \n“experience  embarrassment,  humiliation,  anxiety,  intimidation,  fear,  apprehension,  stress, \ndegradation, and loss of dignity” because of the Restroom Policy.  Id. at ¶ 226. \n  Plaintiffs generally allege the Restroom Policy and the Locker Room Agreement have a \nnegative effect on Girl Plaintiffs’ access to educational opportunities, benefits, programs, and \nactivities at their schools.  Id. at ¶¶ 12-13.  Plaintiffs allege some Girl Plaintiffs risk tardiness by \nrunning to the opposite end of the school, during short passing periods, to find a restroom or \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthis case as boys’ and girls’ restrooms and locker rooms.  For the most part, the Court has adopted \nPlaintiffs’ convention of referring to male and female high school students as “boys” and “girls.”   \n10 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 11 of 82 PageID #:1824\nlocker room that Student A is not likely to be using, and change clothes as quickly as possible \nwhile experiencing stress and anxiety and avoiding eye contact and conversation.  Id. at ¶ 12.   \n  Plaintiffs allege the privacy protections District 211 provides in restrooms and locker \nrooms do not do enough to ameliorate Student Plaintiffs’ concerns about sharing those facilities \nwith a transgender student assigned a different sex than theirs at birth, or the risk that they may \nsee or be seen by a transgender student when either is in an unclothed or partially clothed state.  \nPlaintiffs allege there are “large gaps” above and below the doors on the stalls in both the boys’ \nand girls’ restrooms, id. ¶ 158, and “gaps along the sides of the door[] that another student could \nsee through even inadvertently,” id. at ¶ 228.  Plaintiffs allege this “mean[s] that the Student \nPlaintiffs, both boys and girls, must risk exposing themselves to the opposite sex every time they \nuse the restroom.”  Id. at ¶ 229.  Plaintiffs allege the privacy stalls provided in the physical \neducation locker room for changing clothes or showering are not adequate to address Girl \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental concern with using the same facility as Student A.  Id. at ¶¶ 259-260.  \nPlaintiffs also allege Girl Plaintiffs are ridiculed and harassed by their classmates when they use \nthe privacy stalls.  Id. at ¶¶ 140-146.  Plaintiffs allege there are no private stalls in the girls’ swim \nlocker room and the girls’ gymnastics locker room for changing clothes or showering.  Id. at ¶¶ \n161, 172-174, 196-197.  Plaintiffs allege the completely separate, private facilities District 211 \nprovides for students who do not want to use the common facilities “are inadequate and inferior” \nto the common facilities and “unworkable in terms of the practical locker room needs of Girl \nPlaintiffs.”  Id. at ¶ 245; see also id. at ¶¶ 242-244.       \nC.    Plaintiffs’ Motion For Preliminary Injunction \n  On May 23, 2016, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on Counts I, II, and IV of \ntheir Complaint.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Plaintiffs’ Motion”), [ECF No. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 12 of 82 PageID #:1825\n21].  As noted above, Count I is a claim against the Federal Defendants for violating the APA.  \nCount II is a claim against both the Federal Defendants and District 211 for violating Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional right to privacy.  Count IV is a claim against District 211 for violating Title IX.  \nJudge Alonso referred Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction to this Magistrate Judge for \na Report and Recommendation.  [ECF Nos. 24, 26].   \n  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs ask the Court to “set aside” or enjoin DOE’s “new rule that \nredefines ‘sex’ in Title IX” and to enjoin the Federal Defendants from taking “any action” based \non this interpretation of Title IX and its implementing regulations as requiring schools to treat a \nstudent’s gender identity as the student’s sex.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, Prayer for Relief, at ¶¶ B \nand C].  During oral argument on their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, however, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel clarified that Plaintiffs are asking the Court only to enter a preliminary injunction \nrestraining the Federal Defendants from “further application of the rule to force District 211 to \ncomply with it in the operation of its facilities.”  Oral Argument Transcript, [ECF No. 127, at \n155]; see also id. at 155-58.  In other words, Plaintiffs are not now asking the Court broadly to \n“set aside” a rule or prevent the Federal Defendants from taking “any action” based on DOE’s \ninterpretation of Title IX other than with respect to District 211.  Id.  Plaintiffs will seek broader \nrelief if they prevail on the merits of their claims at the conclusion of this case.  Id.  Plaintiffs \nfurther seek to enjoin District 211 from enforcing the Restroom Policy and complying with the \nLocker Room Agreement.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, Prayer for Relief, at ¶ A].6   \n                                                 \n6 After Plaintiffs filed their Motion, a federal district court in Texas issued a “nationwide” injunction \nagainst several federal agencies and various officials, including the Federal Defendants in this case, \nenjoining them from: (1) “enforcing” certain guidelines against the plaintiffs in that case and “their \nrespective schools, school boards, and other public, educationally-based institutions”; (2) “initiating, \ncontinuing, or concluding any investigation based on [their] interpretation that the definition of sex \nincludes gender identity”; and (3) “using the Guidelines or asserting the Guidelines carry weight in any \nlitigation initiated following the date of [its] Order.”  Texas v. United States, 2016 WL 4426495, at *17 \n(N.D. Tex. Aug. 21, 2016).  The court said that its injunction was not intended to interfere with litigation \n12 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 13 of 82 PageID #:1826\nD.    District 211’s Request For Early Discovery And The June 9, 2016 Hearing \n  Shortly after Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, District 211 requested leave to \nconduct discovery before responding to Plaintiffs’ Motion.  Plaintiffs opposed the District’s \nrequest for early discovery.  They wanted a relatively quick (as the litigation timeline goes) \ndecision on their request for injunctive relief and to avoid getting bogged down in fact-intensive, \ndrawn-out discovery that potentially could delay a decision on their Motion.  On June 3, 2016, at \nthe Court’s direction, District 211 served the interrogatories it wanted Plaintiffs to answer and a \nshort memorandum explaining why the District felt the discovery was necessary for a ruling on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion.  [ECF No. 44].  Five days later, on June 8, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for \nProtective Order opposing the requested discovery.  [ECF No. 48].   \n  On June 9, 2016, the Court held a hearing and granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective \nOrder.  The Court found that responses to the interrogatories District 211 sought to serve were \nnot necessary at this preliminary stage for the Court to make its recommendation on Plaintiffs’ \nMotion.  [ECF No. 52].  The Court’s ruling was based on Plaintiffs’ representation that the thrust \nof their case in support of their Motion rests on facial challenges to the Restroom Policy and the \nLocker Room Agreement which, as Plaintiffs allege, is the result of DOE’s interpretation of Title \nIX in the Guidance Documents.  In Plaintiffs’ words:   \nPlaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion places before this Court two questions of \nlaw related to the activities of the District.  First, does letting a biological male \nuse the girls’ locker rooms and restrooms, and so subjecting the Girl Plaintiffs to \nthe risk of compelled exposure of their bodies to the opposite biological sex, \nviolate the Girl Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy?  Second, does letting a \nbiological male use these private female facilities create a hostile environment for \nthe Girl Plaintiffs, in violation of Title IX, and does offering the Girl Plaintiffs \nincomparable facilities as compared to boy students violate Title IX?   \n                                                                                                                                                             \nbefore other courts involving the same issues.  Id.  For this and other reasons, the Texas injunction does \nnot impact this case.  See Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep’t. of Educ., -\n-- F. Supp. 3d --- , 2016 WL 5372349, at *20 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 26, 2016). \n  \n13 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 14 of 82 PageID #:1827\n   \nPlaintiffs’  Memorandum  in  Support  of  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Protective  Order  (“Plaintiffs’ \nProtective Order Brief”), [ECF No. 50, at 3].   \n  At the June 9 hearing, Plaintiffs’ counsel elaborated on what Plaintiffs were and were not \narguing in support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction:   \nWhat you need to know, Your Honor, is that the policy exists, nobody disputes \nthat, that the policy allows a biological [male] student into a locker room and \nrestroom, and that, of course, results in interactions in the locker room on a daily \nbasis  between  girls  and  boys.  .  .  .    Inserting  the  biological  male  into  those \nfacilities is sufficient to show the violation.   \n \nTranscript of June 9, 2016 Hearing (“June 9 Hearing Transcript”) [ECF No. 128, at 18]. \n  District 211’s proposed interrogatories (and depositions of certain Plaintiffs and others \nthat might have followed) were focused on discovering the “who, what, where, when, etc.”—in \nother words, the facts—underlying Plaintiffs’ anonymous, general, and relatively conclusory \nallegations in their Complaint.  See District 211’s Proposed Interrogatories, [ECF No. 44-1].  \nPlaintiffs argued none of that discovery was necessary at this stage because they are not relying \non the specifics of any interactions in either restrooms or locker rooms between any Plaintiff and \nStudent A or anyone else in support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  According to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel, “who saw who in the state of undress or naked . . . is not relevant . . . at the \npreliminary  injunction  stage.    We  don’t  need  to  prove  that.    We  didn’t  allege  that  in  the \ncomplaint, nor do we rely on it at the preliminary injunction stage.”  June 9 Hearing Transcript, \n[ECF No. 128, at 18].  Rather, Plaintiffs argued the simple fact that Student A, in Plaintiffs’ \nwords a biological boy, is or can be present in the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms is what \nentitles them to the relief they seek:   \nThe District’s policies allow Student A access to the girls’ private facilities. . . . \nStudent A has used the girls’ facilities while some Girl Plaintiffs were present.  \nGirl Plaintiffs know that any time they use the restroom or locker room, Student \n14 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 15 of 82 PageID #:1828\nA has the right to be present with them.  They also know that, even if he is not \npresent, he could walk in at any time.  As a result, Girl Plaintiffs are suffering \nstress, anxiety, embarrassment, and intimidation.   \n \nPlaintiffs’ Protective Order Brief, [ECF No. 50, at 3].7         \n  The Court agreed Plaintiffs are entitled to frame the issues as they want in support of \ntheir Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  The Court also recognized that, if it allowed District \n211 to proceed with the discovery it wanted to take, that materially could delay a decision on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion.  In addition, District 211’s counsel agreed that if Plaintiffs were resting their \ncase in favor of a preliminary injunction on “the risk of exposure . . . in front of a biological male \nwhose gender identity is female . . . [a] fact that I don’t think anybody disputes[,] . . . as opposed \nto looking at what plaintiffs allege has actually happened in locker rooms and restrooms,” then \nthe District’s proposed discovery could be deferred.  June 9 Hearing Transcript, [ECF No. 128, \nat 15].     \n  On  May  25,  2016,  Students  A,  B,  and  C,  by  and  through  their  parents  and  legal \nguardians, and the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance (collectively, “Intervenor-Defendants”) filed a \nMotion to Intervene in this case.  [ECF No. 30].  As discussed above, Student A is the subject of \nthe Locker Room Agreement entered into by DOE and District 211.  Locker Room Agreement, \n[ECF No. 21-3].  Student C is a transgender boy who recently entered his freshman year at a high \nschool in District 211 and wants to use the boys’ restrooms and locker rooms at his school.  \nDeclaration of Parent C (“Parent C’s Declaration”), [ECF No. 32-3, at ¶¶ 2, 10].  Student B is a \ntransgender boy who soon will attend a high school in District 211 and wants to use the boys’ \nrestrooms  and  locker  rooms  at  his  high  school.    Declaration  of  Parent  B  (“Parent  B’s \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiffs also opposed the District’s discovery because they intimated that if certain individual plaintiffs \nor members of the association plaintiff were forced to disclose their identities, as the District asked them \nto do in its interrogatories, they might drop out of the lawsuit, which was something Plaintiffs wanted to \navoid.  Plaintiffs’ Protective Order Brief, [ECF No. 50, at 5].   \n15 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 16 of 82 PageID #:1829\nDeclaration”), [ECF No. 32-2, at ¶¶ 2, 19].  The Illinois Safe Schools Alliance is an organization \nthat supports lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students in Illinois through advocacy and \ntraining, including in District 211.  Declaration of Owen Daniel-McCarter, [ECF No. 32-4, at ¶¶ \n2-15].  On June 15, 2016, Judge Alonso granted Intervenor-Defendants’ Motion to Intervene.  \n[ECF No. 56].  Intervenor-Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction is fully briefed, and this Court held oral \nargument on August 15, 2016.  The record before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion consists of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint and the attached exhibits, the parties’ respective briefs filed in support of \nand in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion, the various declarations and other materials submitted \nwith those briefs, and counsels’ oral arguments during the hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion.  For all \nof the reasons set forth below, the Court respectfully recommends that Judge Alonso deny \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n  A preliminary injunction “‘is an extraordinary and drastic remedy.’”  Goodman v. Ill. \nDep’t of Fin., 430 F.3d 432, 437 (7th Cir. 2005) (quoting Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, \n972 (1997)).  In the Seventh Circuit, the court analyzes a request for such relief in two distinct \nphases: a threshold phase and a balancing phase.  Girl Scouts of Manitou Council Inc. v. Girl \nScouts of USA, Inc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1085-86 (7th Cir. 2008).  During both phases, movants—\nhere, Plaintiffs—bear the burden of proving “‘by a clear showing’” that a preliminary injunction \nshould be granted.  Goodman, 430 F.3d at 437 (quoting Mazurek, 520 U.S. at 972) (emphasis in \nthe original).   \n  During  the  first  phase,  Plaintiffs  must  make  three  threshold  showings.    Turnell  v. \nCentiMark Corp., 796 F.3d 656, 661-62 (7th Cir. 2015).  Plaintiffs must show they have a \n16 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 17 of 82 PageID #:1830\nlikelihood of success on the merits.  Id. at 662.  They must show, “absent preliminary injunctive \nrelief, [they] will suffer irreparable harm in the interim prior to a final resolution.”  Id.  And \nPlaintiffs must show there is no adequate remedy at law.  Id.  If Plaintiffs fail to make any of \nthese showings, the court must deny injunctive relief.  Girl Scouts, 549 F.3d at 1086. \n  If Plaintiffs carry their burden in the threshold phase, the court then proceeds to the \nbalancing phase.  During this stage of the analysis, the court first “weighs the irreparable harm \nthat the moving part[ies] would endure without the protection of the preliminary injunction \nagainst any irreparable harm the nonmoving part[ies] would suffer if the court were to grant the \nrequested relief.”  Id.  Then the court considers how granting or denying the injunction would \naffect the interests of non-parties—commonly called the “public interest.”  Ty, Inc. v. Jones Grp., \nInc., 237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001).  During the balancing phase, the court “weighs the \nbalance of potential harms on a ‘sliding scale’ against the movant[s’] likelihood of success.”  \nTurnell, 796 F.3d at 662. \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nA.    Likelihood Of Success On The Merits \n  To satisfy the first threshold requirement for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must \nshow they have a likelihood of success on the merits.  D.U. v. Rhoades, 825 F.3d 331, 338 (7th \nCir. 2016).  “This ‘likelihood’ standard requires more than a ‘mere possibility of relief’ and more \nthan  a  ‘better  than  negligible’  showing.”    Truth  Foundation  Ministries,  NFP  v.  Village  of \nRomeoville, --- F. Supp. 3d --- , 2016 WL 757982, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 26, 2016). \n17 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 18 of 82 PageID #:1831\n1.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown They Have A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits \nOf Their APA Claim Against The Federal Defendants \n \na.  The Locker Room Agreement And The Federal Defendants’ Interpretation Of The \nWord “Sex” In Title IX Are Subject To Judicial Review \n \n  The APA vests “the courts with the power to ‘interpret . . . statutory provisions’ and \noverturn agency action inconsistent with those interpretations.”  Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, ---\nF.3d --- , 2016 WL 4436309, at *7 (10th Cir. Aug. 23, 2016) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (quoting 5 \nU.S.C. § 706).  But the APA limits judicial review to “final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704; see also Salazar v. King, 822 F.3d 61, 82 (2d \nCir. 2016).  Therefore, “[w]hether there has been ‘agency action’ or ‘final agency action’ within \nthe meaning of the APA are threshold questions; if these requirements are not met, the action is \nnot reviewable.”  Fund for Animals, Inc. v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 460 F.3d 13, 18 (D.C. \nCir. 2006). \n  The APA defines “agency action” to include “the whole or a part of an agency rule, \norder, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”  5 U.S.C. § \n551(13).  Only two of these types of actions—sanction and rule—are relevant to this case.  A \nsanction is, in pertinent part, “the whole or a part of an agency . . . prohibition, requirement, \nlimitation, or other condition affecting the freedom of a person.”  Id. at § 551(10).  And a “rule” \nis, again in pertinent part, “the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular \napplicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.”  Id. \nat § 551(4).  \n  This case involves a sanction and a rule.  Plaintiffs argue and the Federal Defendants \nagree the Locker Room Agreement is a sanction because it imposes “concrete consequences” on \nDistrict 211.  See Oral Argument Transcript, [ECF No. 127, at 48, 141, 143, 151].  The rule is \n18 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 19 of 82 PageID #:1832\nthe  Federal  Defendants’  “interpretation  of  Title  IX,”  stated  in  the  Guidance,  “as  requiring \nschools to treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX and its \nimplementing  regulations.”    Federal  Defendants’  Memorandum  of  Law  in  Opposition  to \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Federal Defendants’ Response Brief”), [ECF No. \n80, at 1].  The Federal Defendants agree with Plaintiffs that this “interpretation,” which the Court \nwill refer to as “the Rule,” is a rule.  See id. at 15 (“Here, the Guidance has all the indicia of an \ninterpretive rule.”). \n  Generally, an agency action is final when the action marks the consummation of the \nagency’s decision-making process, and has legal consequences or, phrased another way, directly \naffects a party.  Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 452 F.3d 798, 800, \n806  (D.C.  Cir.  2006);  Home  Builders  Ass’n  of  Greater  Chicago  v.  U.S.  Army  Corps  of \nEngineers, 335 F.3d 607, 614 (7th Cir. 2003).  Under this standard, an agency’s behavior may \nindicate that an action is final even when the agency has not observed “‘the conventional \nprocedural accoutrements of finality.’”  Kobach v. U.S. Election Assistance Comm’n, 772 F.3d \n1183, 1189 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 479 \n(2001)).  In the end, the finality requirement must be interpreted pragmatically.  U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1815 (2016); Rhea Lana, Inc. v. Dep’t of Labor, \n824 F.3d 1023, 1027 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \n  The Federal Defendants do “not contest[]” that the Locker Room Agreement constitutes \nfinal agency action.  Oral Argument Transcript, [ECF No. 127, at 48, 139]; see also id. at 141, \n143.  The Locker Room Agreement marked the conclusion of DOE’s administrative action \nagainst District 211, and DOE did not contemplate any further proceedings.  The Locker Room \nAgreement  imposes  on  District  211  concrete  obligations  that,  according  to  the  Federal \n19 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 20 of 82 PageID #:1833\nDefendants, are legally enforceable.  See id. at 48, 141, 143, 151.  At least some of these legal \nobligations exceed what Title IX and its implementing regulations would require the District to \ndo if the Locker Room Agreement did not exist.  The Court thus is satisfied that the Locker \nRoom Agreement constitutes final agency action because it represents the culmination of DOE’s \ndecision-making process and has concrete legal consequences that bind District 211 and impact \nPlaintiffs. \n  The Federal Defendants argue the Rule is not final agency action and, thus, not subject to \njudicial review.  They do not dispute that the Rule is the culmination of DOE’s decision-making \nprocess with respect to the issue of whether “sex” as used in Title IX includes gender identity.  \nInstead, they assert in a footnote that the Rule “is not final agency action . . . because it does not \ndetermine rights or obligations and no ‘legal consequences’ flow from it.”  Federal Defendants’ \nResponse Brief, [ECF No. 80, at 16 n.9].  The Federal Defendants do not say why the Rule does \nnot  determine  rights  or  obligations  and  has  no  legal  consequences.    Instead,  the  footnote \nreferences the corresponding text in the body of the brief, which explains why, in the Federal \nDefendants’  view,  the  Rule  is  interpretive,  not  legislative.    In  essence,  then,  the  Federal \nDefendants seem to be arguing the Rule is not a final agency action because it is an interpretive \nrule.  \n  This argument is contrary to clear precedent holding that interpretive rules and guidance \ndocuments may be subject to judicial review.  Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 251 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014); Oregon v. Ashcroft, 368 F.3d 1118, 1147 (9th Cir. 2004), aff’d sub nom., \nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243 (2006).  “‘An agency may not avoid judicial review merely by \nchoosing the form of’” a guidance document “‘to express its definitive position on a general \nquestion of statutory interpretation.’”  CSI Aviation Servs., Inc. v.

EPA, 801 F.2d 430, 438 n.9 (D.C. \nCir. 1986)).  “Once [an] agency publicly articulates an unequivocal position . . . and expects \nregulated entities to alter their primary conduct to conform to that position, the agency has \nvoluntarily relinquished the benefit of postponed judicial review.”  Ciba-Geigy, 801 F.2d at 436; \nsee also Am. Tort Reform Ass’n v. Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 738 F.3d 387, 395 \n(D.C.

Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C. \nCir. 2000).  It does not describe what DOE thinks Title IX might mean or propose how schools \npossibly could interpret Title IX.  The Guidance Documents state definitively that “Title IX’s sex \ndiscrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity,” Q&A \non Sexual Violence, [ECF No. 21-9, at 5], and tell schools what they “must” do to comply with \nTitle IX, see, e.g., Q&A on Single-Sex Classes and Extracurricular Activities, [ECF No. 21-8, at \n25]; Title IX Resource Guide, [ECF No. 21-7, at 21-22].  DOE has not expressed any uncertainty \nabout the binding nature of its interpretation.  To the contrary, even since the filing of this \nlawsuit, DOE has continued to maintain and advance its interpretation as binding on schools in \nthe United States.  On May 23, 2016, for example, DOE issued a Dear Colleague Letter saying \nthat “[w]hen a school provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students must \n                                                 \n8 “If an agency acts as if a document issued at headquarters is controlling in the field, if it treats the \ndocument in the same manner as it treats a legislative rule, if it bases enforcement actions on the policies \nor interpretations formulated in the document, if it leads private parties or State permitting authorities to \nbelieve that it will declare permits invalid unless they comply with the terms of the document, then the \nagency’s document is for all practical purposes ‘binding.’”  Appalachian Power, 208 F.3d at 1021. \n \n21 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 22 of 82 PageID #:1835\nbe allowed to participate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity.”  Dear Colleague Letter, [ECF No. 21-6, at 3].  There is no indication in the record that, \nwithin DOE, agency officials consider the Rule to be a suggestion or an interim position.  Rather, \nit guides DOE’s review of complaints and pursuit of enforcement actions.   \n  In this particular case, the Rule “informed” DOE’s “review” of Student A’s complaint \nagainst District 211.  Federal Defendants’ Response Brief, [ECF No. 80, at 1-2].  After its \nreview, DOE sent a Letter of Findings to District 211, saying the agency found the District to be \nin violation of Title IX, and that, if DOE and the District did not agree to resolve the matter, the \nagency would issue a Letter of Impending Enforcement Action within 30 days, initiating a \nprocess that ultimately could result in District 211 losing its federal funding.  Letter of Findings, \n[ECF No. 21-10, at 13].  District 211 and DOE then entered into the Locker Room Agreement, a \nresolution  that  the  Federal  Defendants  concede  was  “informed”  by  the  Rule.    Federal \nDefendants’ Response Brief, [ECF No. 80, at 1-2].  The Federal Defendants concede the Locker \nRoom Agreement has a direct and consequential effect on District 211 and, thus, in turn on \nPlaintiffs.  See Oral Argument Transcript, [ECF No. 127, at 48, 141, 143, 151]. \n   DOE says it issued the Rule in response to questions it was receiving from schools \naround  the  country  confronted  with  how  they  should  address  transgender  students’  use  of \nfacilities denominated as single-sex.  See Federal Defendants’ Response Brief, [ECF No. 80, at \n16];  Q&A  on  Sexual  Violence,  [ECF  No.  21-9,  at  ii];  Q&A  on  Single-Sex  Classes  and \nExtracurricular Activities, [ECF No. 21-8, at 1].  As a practical matter, the Rule represents and \nhas been treated by DOE as its definitive statement that “sex” as used in Title IX and its \nimplementing regulations includes gender identity.  This has led some schools, such as District \n211, to acquiesce to DOE’s view.  For all of these reasons, the Rule constitutes final agency \n22 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 23 of 82 PageID #:1836\naction.  See Nat’l Envtl. Dev.

The APA provides that a court may \nreview preliminary and intermediate agency actions “on the review of the final agency action.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 704.  That means when a court is reviewing a final agency action, such as the Locker \nRoom Agreement, it also can review any preliminary or intermediate agency actions that led to \nthe final agency action.  See Benzman v. Whitman, 523 F.3d 119, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); Oliver v. \nU.S. Dep’t of the Army, 2015 WL 4561157, at *3 (D.N.J. July 28, 2015); Souza v.

Cir. 1991) (“Section 704 authorizes us to review only those \npreliminary, intermediate, or procedural rulings that relate to the final agency action presently \nbefore the court.”).   \nFor all of these reasons, the Rule is subject to judicial review in this case. \n \n                                                 \n9 In Texas v. United States, the court reviewed a different, but slightly overlapping, set of DOE guidance \ndocuments containing the same rule, and also concluded DOE’s promulgation of the rule constituted a \nfinal agency action.  2016 WL 4426495, at *2 & n.4, 8-9. \n23 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 24 of 82 PageID #:1837\nb.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown They Have A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits \nOf Their Argument That “Sex” As Used In Title IX Unambiguously Excludes \nGender Identity \n \n  Plaintiffs argue DOE violated the APA by promulgating the Rule and entering into the \nLocker Room Agreement which, according to Plaintiffs, conflict with the unambiguous meaning \nof the term “sex” in Title IX.  Plaintiffs contend the statute and its implementing regulations \nunambiguously mean that one’s “sex” is determined by his or her “chromosomes, anatomy, \ngametes,  and  reproductive  system.”    Plaintiffs’  Reply  Memorandum  in  Support  of  Their \nPreliminary Injunction Motion (“Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief”), [ECF No. 94, at 1].  Sex does not and \ncannot, Plaintiffs assert, include gender identity.  Plaintiffs look to Seventh Circuit decisions \ninterpreting Congress’s intent when it used the word “sex” in the almost identically worded Title \nVII to support their position under Title IX.   \n  The Federal Defendants argue the word “sex” as used in Title IX is ambiguous as to \nwhether one’s sex is determined “‘with reference exclusively to genitalia’” or “‘with reference to \ngender identity.’”  Federal Defendants’ Response Brief, [ECF No. 80, at 19] (quoting G.G. ex \nrel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 720 (4th Cir. 2016)).  They claim that, \nbecause of this ambiguity, courts should defer to DOE’s interpretation of the term “sex” under \nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), and Chevron U.S.A. v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 \nU.S. 837 (1984).  Intervenor-Defendants go a step further and argue that whenever there is not \ncomplete alignment among a student’s sex-related characteristics, the unambiguous meaning of \nthe term “sex” in Title IX requires that schools determine a student’s sex based upon his or her \ngender identity because gender identity in those circumstances is the only way to determine sex.  \nIntervenor-Defendants’  Brief  in  Response  to  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction \n(“Intervenor-Defendants’ Response Brief”), [ECF No. 79, at 2-7]. \n24 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 25 of 82 PageID #:1838\n  The Seventh Circuit first addressed, to the extent relevant here, the meaning of “sex” as \nused in Title VII in Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1984).  In that case, \nwhich involved a transsexual plaintiff alleging employment discrimination under Title VII, the \ncourt of appeals held Congress intended the term “sex” in Title VII to have a “narrow, traditional \ninterpretation.”  Id. at 1086.  Ulane was decided in 1984, more than 32 years ago, and a number \nof courts around the country since then have declined to follow its reasoning in light of more \nrecent developments in the law including, among others, the Supreme Court’s recognition in \n1989 that discrimination claims based upon gender stereotypes and gender non-conformity are \ncognizable under Title  VII.   See Price  Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490  U.S. 228, 251  (1989) \n(“Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women \nresulting from sex stereotypes.”); see also Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316-17 (11th Cir. \n2011); Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio, 378 F.3d 566, 572-75 (6th Cir. 2004); Rosa v. Park W. Bank \n& Trust Co., 214 F.3d 213, 215-16 (1st Cir. 2000); Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1201-02 \n(9th Cir. 2000); Roberts v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 2016 WL 5843046, at *6 (D. Nev. Oct. 4, \n2016).10 \n  On July 28, 2016, in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College, South Bend, a panel of the \nSeventh Circuit had an opportunity to overrule Ulane but declined to do so. 830 F.3d 698 (7th \nCir. 2016).  Instead, it concluded Ulane’s holding that Congress intended a very narrow and \ntraditional interpretation of the term “sex” in Title VII “so far, appears to be correct.”  Id. at 702.  \nOn October 11, 2016, however, the full Seventh Circuit vacated the panel’s decision in Hively \nand granted a rehearing en banc in that case, with oral argument scheduled for November 30, \n2016.  Order Granting Rehearing En Banc and Vacating the Panel Opinion, Hively v. Ivy Tech \n                                                 \n10 Although not all of these cases are Title VII cases, they do evidence broad support for the proposition \nthat the term “sex” in the context of statutes similarly designed to attack discrimination on the basis of sex \nshould not be construed narrowly.    \n25 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 26 of 82 PageID #:1839\nCmty.

Oct. 11, \n2016).   \n  As a result of these recent developments, it appears the law in the Seventh Circuit \nconcerning the interpretation of the term “sex” in Title VII, as relevant to the almost identically \nworded Title IX, may be in flux.  When the Seventh Circuit rules after its en banc review of \nHively, whether with one voice or otherwise, it very well could shed important new light on the \nquestion  of  whether  the  term  “sex”  as  used  in  Title  VII,  and  by  implication  in  Title  IX, \nencompasses gender identity.   \n  To understand the parties’ respective arguments as to the meaning of the term “sex” \nunder Title VII and Title IX and the current state of the law in that respect in this Circuit and \naround the country, it is important to understand the Seventh Circuit’s decisions in Ulane and its \nprogeny through and including the recent panel decision, now vacated, in Hively.   \ni.  Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc. and its progeny \n  The plaintiff in Ulane, Karen Frances Ulane, was an Army veteran who earned the Air \nMedal with eight clusters for her service in Vietnam.  Ulane, 742 F.2d at 1082.  When Ulane \nreturned home, Eastern Airlines, Inc. hired her as a pilot, and she eventually reached the position \nof First Officer.  Id.  When it discovered that Ulane was transsexual, though, Eastern fired her.  \nId. at 1082-83.  Ulane then filed suit, alleging that Eastern discriminated against her because of \nher sex in violation of Title VII.  Id. at 1082.  The district court, after a bench trial, found that \n“sex”  “comprehend[s]  ‘sexual  identity’”  because  “‘sex  is  not  a  cut-and-dried  matter  of \nchromosomes,’ but is in part a psychological question—a question of self-perception; and in part \na social matter—a question of how society perceives the individual.”  Id. at 1084 (quoting Ulane \nv. Eastern Airlines, Inc., 581 F. Supp. 821, 823-24 (N.D. Ill. 1983), rev’d, 742 F.2d 1081 (7th \n26 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 27 of 82 PageID #:1840\nCir. 1984)).  The district court ruled in Ulane’s favor, holding Title VII prohibits discrimination \non the basis of transsexualism.  Id.  The court also ruled Eastern had discriminated against Ulane \nas a female.  Id.  at 1087.   \n  The Seventh Circuit disagreed with the district court’s analysis and held Title VII does \nnot prohibit discrimination on the basis of transsexualism.  Id. at 1084.  In doing so, the court of \nappeals attempted to discern Congress’s intent when it enacted Title VII, and the court identified \nthree adjectives that describe Congress’s thinking about the plain meaning of “sex.”  See id. at \n1085, 1086 (discussing the “plain” and “common” meaning of Title VII).  The first adjective is \n“traditional.”  Id. at 1085 (recognizing “Congress never considered nor intended that this 1964 \nlegislation apply to anything other than the traditional concept of sex”); id. at 1085-86 (saying \nCongress’s failure to amend Title VII “strongly indicates . . . sex should be given a . . . \ntraditional interpretation”); id. at 1086 (determining only Congress can decide whether “sex” \nshould encompasses “the untraditional”); id. (declining “to judicially expand the definition of sex \nas used in Title VII beyond its common and traditional interpretation”).  The second is “narrow.”  \nId. at 1085-86 (concluding Congress’s failure to amend Title VII “strongly indicates . . . sex \nshould be given a narrow . . . interpretation”); id. at 1086 (explaining “Congress had a narrow \nview of sex in mind when it passed the Civil Rights Act”).  And the third is “biological.”  Id. at \n1087 (agreeing “with the Eighth and Ninth Circuits that if the term ‘sex’ as it is used in Title VII \nis to mean more than biological male or biological female, the new definition must come from \nCongress”).11   \n                                                 \n11 It is hard to reconcile the court of appeals’ holding that “sex” under Title VII has a narrow, traditional, \nand biological meaning, and does not encompass sexual identity, with its statement in dicta that “[i]f \nEastern had considered Ulane to be female and had discriminated against her because she was female . . . \nthen the argument might be made that Title VII applied.”  Ulane, 742 F.2d at 1087.  The court reversed \nthe district court’s finding that Eastern had discriminated against Ulane as a female because that finding \nwas not supported by sufficient factual evidence in the record.  Id.  But the court’s apparent willingness to \n27 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 28 of 82 PageID #:1841\n  Based  on  its  understanding  of  congressional  intent,  the  Seventh  Circuit  in  Ulane \noverruled the district court’s conclusion that “sex” “comprehend[s] ‘sexual identity.’”  Id. at \n1084.  The court of appeals said that “even though some may define ‘sex’ in such a way as to \nmean an individual’s ‘sexual identity,’ our responsibility is to . . . determine what Congress \nintended when it decided to outlaw discrimination based on sex.”  Id.  In this context, the \nSeventh Circuit held discrimination because of “sex” does not encompass discrimination based \non “a sexual identity disorder or discontent with the sex into which [one was] born.”  Id. at \n1085.12   \n  Between 1984 and 2015, the Seventh Circuit referenced Ulane’s holding that the word \n“sex” in Title VII is to be interpreted in a narrow, traditional, and biological sense in three \nopinions.  In Doe by Doe v. City of Belleville, Illinois, a 1997 decision, the court of appeals said \n“Congress had nothing more than the traditional notion of ‘sex’ in mind when it voted to outlaw \nsex discrimination.”  119 F.3d 563, 572 (7th Cir. 1997), judgment vacated sub nom. City of \nBelleville  v.  Doe  by  Doe,  523  U.S.  1001  (1998),  and  abrogated  by  Oncale  v.  Sundowner \nOffshore  Servs.,  Inc.,  523  U.S.  75  (1998).13    Then,  in  a  pair  of  opinions—Hamner  and \nSpearman—released just two months apart in 2000, the Seventh Circuit, again relying on Ulane, \nreaffirmed  that  “Congress  intended  the  term  ‘sex’  to  mean  ‘biological  male  or  biological \n                                                                                                                                                             \nconsider a claim that Ulane was the victim of discrimination as a woman implies that the court would be \nconsidering her gender identity as relevant and potentially dispositive in the context of a Title VII claim.   \n \n12  The court’s use of language in Ulane and its reference to medical sources is somewhat dated today.  \nFor example, the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders recognizes \nthat gender non-conformity is not a mental disorder; this is a change from prior editions of the DSM, \nincluding the Third Edition, which was in effect when Ulane was decided.  American Psychiatric \nAssociation, Gender Dysphoria 1 (2013), available at http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dy \nsphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf (discussing changes made in the Fifth Edition of the DSM).   \n \n13 But see Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 251 (“Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of \ndisparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.”).   \n28 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 29 of 82 PageID #:1842\nfemale.’”  Spearman v. Ford Motor Co., 231 F.3d 1080, 1084-85 (7th Cir. 2000) (quoting Ulane, \n742 F.2d at 1087); Hamner v. St. Vincent Hosp. & Health Care Ctr., Inc., 224 F.3d 701, 704 (7th \nCir. 2000) (quoting Ulane, 742 F.2d at 1087).  Between 2001 and 2015, though, Ulane almost \nentirely faded from Seventh Circuit opinions.14   \nii.  Hively and the Seventh Circuit’s decision to vacate the panel’s ruling \nand rehear that case en banc \n \n  As noted above, on July 28, 2016, Ulane re-emerged in the Seventh Circuit.  In Hively, a \npanel of the court of appeals said Ulane remained good law.  The plaintiff-appellant in that case, \nKimberly Hively, was a former teacher who alleged Ivy Tech Community College denied her \nfull-time employment and promotions on the basis of her sexual orientation.  Hively, 830 F.3d at \n699.  On appeal, Hively argued, among other things, that Ulane and Hamner were wrong and \nshould be reversed.  Appellant’s Brief at 4-17, Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. Coll., S. Bend, 830 F.3d \n698 (7th Cir. 2016) (No. 15-1720), Dkt. No. 10.  The panel in Hively rejected this argument.  \nInstead, the panel said the “understanding in Ulane that Congress intended a very narrow reading \nof the term ‘sex’ when it passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, so far, appears to be correct.”  \nHively, 830 F.3d at 702.   \n  Plaintiffs, the Federal Defendants, and Intervenor-Defendants (District 211 did not brief \nthe APA issue) submitted supplemental briefs after the panel’s decision in Hively.  Plaintiffs \nargued Ulane and Hively were case dispositive in their favor: “[u]nder the law of Hively and \nUlane, Plaintiffs should prevail on the merits of their APA claim, as well as their Title IX and \nprivacy  claims,  and  so  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  should  be  granted.”  \nPlaintiffs’ Supplemental Brief Addressing Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. Coll., S. Bend, No. 15-1720, \n                                                 \n14 From 2001 through 2015, the Seventh Circuit cited Ulane in just one case.  Davis v. Ruby Foods, Inc., \n269 F.3d 818, 819 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing Ulane for the proposition that Title VII does not prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of transsexualism). \n29 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 30 of 82 PageID #:1843\n2016 WL 4039703 (7th Cir. July 28, 2016) (“Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Brief”), [ECF No. 118, at \n1].  The Federal Defendants and Intervenor-Defendants argued, on the other hand, that Hively \nshould be limited to its facts, and only to Title VII and sexual orientation claims.  See generally \nFederal  Defendants’  Supplemental  Brief,  [ECF  No.  116];  Federal  Defendants’  Responsive \nSupplemental Brief, [ECF No. 121]; Intervenor-Defendants’ Opening Brief on Hively v. Ivy Tech \nCommunity College, No. 15-1720 (7th Cir. 2016) (“Intervenor-Defendants’ Hively Brief”), [ECF \nNo. 117]; Intervenor-Defendants’ Response Brief on Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College, No. \n15-1720 (7th Cir. 2016) (“Intervenor-Defendants’ Responsive Supplemental Brief”), [ECF No. \n120].   \n  The Federal Defendants also argued Ulane and Hively, both of which interpreted Title \nVII, are not relevant to, much less controlling of any resolution of the question presented in this \ncase under Title IX.  Title VII and Title IX are different statutes enacted at different times to \naddress different discriminatory conduct.  And while the court of appeals in Ulane found that \nCongress included the term “sex” in Title VII at the last minute as the resfult of an effort \nintended to kill the bill, Ulane, 742 F.2d at 1085, the entire purpose behind Title IX was to \naddress  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  broadly  in  educational  institutions,  Jackson  v. \nBirmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 175 (2005).  Still, courts routinely rely on Title VII \njurisprudence  to  determine  the  meaning  of  similar  provisions  in  Title  IX.    Carmichael  v. \nGalbraith, 574 F. App’x 286, 293 (5th Cir. 2014); Jennings v. Univ. of N. Carolina, 482 F.3d \n686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007); Doe v. Claiborne Cty., Tenn. By & Through Claiborne Cty. Bd. of \nEduc., 103 F.3d 495, 514 (6th Cir. 1996).  Moreover, in this case, all parties rely on Title VII \ncases in support of their respective legal positions, and they effectively equate the meaning of \n“sex” in Title VII and Title IX.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Brief, [ECF No. 118, at 3]; \n30 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 31 of 82 PageID #:1844\nFederal  Defendants’  Responsive  Supplemental  Brief,  [ECF  No.  121,  at  2];  Intervenor-\nDefendants’  Hively  Brief,  [ECF  No.  117,  at  9];  Intervenor-Defendants’  Responsive \nSupplemental Brief, [ECF No. 120, at 7].   \n  Therefore, had the Seventh Circuit not vacated Hively, the panel’s decision certainly \nwould have been relevant to this Court’s analysis of the issues raised by Plaintiffs under Title IX.  \nWhen the Seventh Circuit vacated the panel’s decision, however, it called into serious question \nwhether the narrow, traditional, and biological interpretation of the term “sex” announced in \nUlane remains good law in this Circuit with respect to Title VII and Title IX.  Moreover, \nalthough the panel in Hively relied on Ulane’s reading of congressional intent underlying Title \nVII, courts throughout the country for years have questioned and discounted the continued \nvitality of Ulane, particularly since the Supreme Court’s decision in Price Waterhouse.  See \nSmith, 378 F.3d at 573 (“[T]he approach in . . . Ulane . . . has been eviscerated by Price \nWaterhouse.”).  As the Sixth Circuit noted in Smith, “the Supreme Court established that Title \nVII’s reference to ‘sex’ encompasses both the biological differences between men and women, \nand gender discrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical \ngender norms.”  Id.   \n  In addition, two of the three judges on the Hively panel said the distinction between \ndiscrimination  claims  based  on  gender  stereotypes  or  gender  non-conformity,  which  are \ncognizable under Title VII but only if a person does not conform to the stereotypes associated \nwith his or her gender assigned at birth, and sexual orientation claims, which are not cognizable \nunder Title VII, “seems illogical,” and “[p]erhaps the writing is on the wall” that this legal \nparadox should be corrected.  Hively, 730 F.3d at 718.15  In this Circuit, the distinction between \n                                                 \n15 See also Hively, 730 F.3d at 715 (“As things stand now . . . our understanding of Title VII leaves us \nwith a somewhat odd body of case law that protects a lesbian who faces discrimination because she fails \n31 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 32 of 82 PageID #:1845\nthese two kinds of claims flows in no small part from the narrow, traditional, and biological \ninterpretation of the term “sex” announced in Ulane.  The same two judges on the Hively panel \nalso recognized that “precedent can be overturned when principles of law have so far developed \nas to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine . . . or whether facts \nhave so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant \napplication or justification.”  Id. at 718 (citing Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. \n33, 854-55 (1992)). 16   \n  In language that seems to invite the kind of re-examination that will now take place in the \nform of an en banc rehearing, two of the three judges on the Hively panel also said:   \n[W]e can see no rational reason to entertain sex discrimination claims for those \nwho defy gender norms by looking or acting stereotypically gay or lesbian (even \nif they are not), but not for those who are openly gay but otherwise comply with \ngender norms.  We allow two women or two men to marry, but allow employers \nto terminate them for doing so.  Perchance, in time, these inconsistencies will \ncome to be seen as defying practical workability and will lead us to reconsider our \nprecedent.  \n \nId.17   \n                                                                                                                                                             \nto meet some superficial gender norms—wearing pants instead of dresses, having short hair, not wearing \nmakeup—but not a lesbian who meets cosmetic gender norms, but violates the most essential of gender \nstereotypes by marrying another woman. . . . It seems likely that neither the proponents nor the opponents \nof protecting employees from sexual orientation discrimination would be satisfied with a body of case law \nthat protects ‘flamboyant’ gay men and ‘butch’ lesbians but not the lesbian or gay employees who act and \nappear straight.”). \n \n16 Ironically, Karen Ulane likely could prevail today on a claim against her employer based on a gender \nnon-conformity theory.  In other words, if Karen Ulane alleged today that she was fired not because she \nwas a transsexual or because she was a woman, but because she failed to conform to Eastern’s stereotype \nof how a man should look or act, she might prevail even if the term “sex” in Title VII is defined in a \nnarrow, traditional, and biological way.  Under the same law, however, if Ulane alleged that she was fired \nbecause she did not conform to Eastern’s stereotype of how a woman should look or act, or because she \nwas a woman, Ulane would not have a claim.   \n \n17  As  Intervenor-Defendants  argue,  “[t]ransgender  persons  by  definition  violate  ‘gender  norms.’”  \nIntervenor-Defendants’ Hively Brief, [ECF No. 117, at 4] (emphasis in original). \n32 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 33 of 82 PageID #:1846\n  In this Court’s view, the Seventh Circuit’s en banc review of Hively also may delve into \nthe underlying basis for the Hively decision, which is whether Ulane correctly divined that \nCongress intended a very narrow, traditional, and biological interpretation of the term “sex” in \nTitle VII.  See Easley v. Reuss, 532 F.3d 592, 594 (7th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (explaining that \nthe Seventh Circuit usually only hears cases en banc to address an intra-circuit split, not involved \nhere, or a question of exceptional importance).  Whether or not the court of appeals does so, \nhowever, its en banc decision could have an important impact on Plaintiffs’ argument about the \nmeaning of the term “sex” in Title VII and, by implication, in Title IX.  In this respect, that \ndecision could affect materially Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their APA claim \nas this case proceeds.   \n  In light of this uncertainty in the Seventh Circuit, it is useful to look to decisions by other \ncourts concerning the issues raised in this case.  To date, only one court of appeals has addressed \nwhether “sex” in Title IX can or must include gender identity.  In a case known as G.G., a \ndistrict court in Virginia found one of Title IX’s implementing regulations allowed a local school \nboard “‘to limit bathroom access ‘on the basis of sex,’ including birth or biological sex.’”  G.G., \n822 F.3d at 719 (quoting G.G. v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 132 F. Supp. 3d 736, 745-46 (E.D. \nVa. Sept. 17, 2015)).  The Fourth Circuit disagreed.  See id. at 727.  In its decision reversing the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals explained that “sex” is ambiguous as it “is susceptible to more \nthan one plausible reading because it permits . . . determining maleness or femaleness with \nreference exclusively to genitalia . . . [and] determining maleness or femaleness with reference to \ngender identity.”  Id. at 720.  The court of appeals concluded DOE’s interpretation of the term \n“sex” at issue in that case, which is the same interpretation challenged in this case, is not plainly \nerroneous or inconsistent with Title IX because various dictionaries from the time when the \n33 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 34 of 82 PageID #:1847\nstatute was enacted and its implementing regulations were promulgated “suggest that a hard-and-\nfast binary division on the basis of reproductive organs—although useful in most cases—was not \nuniversally descriptive.”  Id. at 721.  The Fourth Circuit therefore found DOE’s interpretation of \n“sex” as used in Title IX must be given deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997).  \nG.G., 822 F.3d at 723; see also Carcano v. McCrory Berger, --- F. Supp. 3d --- , 2016 WL \n4508192, at *13-17 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 26, 2016) (recognizing G.G. cannot be limited to its facts  \nand deferring to DOE’s interpretation of “sex”).18 \n  In Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education, a district court \nin the Seventh Circuit reached the same conclusion under Title IX notwithstanding Ulane or \nHively.    Court  Minutes  from  the  Oral  Argument  Hearing  on  9/6/2016  (“Whitaker  Court \nMinutes”), Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 16-cv-00943-PP, Dkt. No. \n26 (Sept. 6, 2016).  The court recognized none of the relevant dictionary definitions “are helpful” \nin determining one’s sex “when . . . genes, or chromosomes, or character, or attributes . . . point \ntoward male identity, and others toward female.”  Id. at 3.  Then it identified some of the \nproblems with a narrow definition of “sex.”  Id. at 3-4.  Finally, the court found Ulane did not \ncontrol the issue because it was a Title VII case decided before Price Waterhouse.  Id. at 4-5.  \nFor these reasons, the court held the term “sex” as used in Title IX is ambiguous and it deferred \nto DOE’s interpretation under Auer.  Id. at 6-7.  \n  A district court in Ohio also recently decided “sex” as used in Title IX is ambiguous and, \ntherefore, DOE’s interpretation should be given deference under Auer.  Highland, 2016 WL \n5372349, at *15.  The court recognized dictionaries at the time Title IX was enacted “defined \n                                                 \n18 Although the Supreme Court stayed the mandate of the Fourth Circuit and the preliminary injunction \nissued by the district court in G.G., pending a petition for a writ of certiorari, Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd. v. \nG.G. ex rel. Grimm, 136 S. Ct. 2442 (2016), G.G., unlike Hively, has not been vacated and still remains \ngood law, Highland, 2016 WL 5372349, at *11 n.5. \n34 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 35 of 82 PageID #:1848\n‘sex’ in a myriad of ways.”  Id. at *11.  Relying in part on G.G., the court concluded that “neither \nTitle IX nor the implementing regulations define the term ‘sex’ or mandate how to determine \nwho is male and who is female when a school provides sex-segregated facilities.”  Id.  The court \nalso  acknowledged  Title  IX  allows  transgender  people  to  bring  claims  when  they  are \ndiscriminated  against  because  of  their  gender  non-conformity.    Id.  at  *12-13.    The  court \nconcluded Title IX is ambiguous and then found DOE’s interpretation is not plainly erroneous or \ninconsistent with Title IX.  Id. at *13-14.  Based on these determinations, the court gave Auer \ndeference to DOE’s rule.  Id. at *14. \n  These decisions holding “sex” is ambiguous in the context of Title IX and, therefore, that \nit can encompass gender identity are well-reasoned and persuasive.19  They provide another basis \nfor questioning whether Ulane, a Title VII case, has continued validity and should be applied in \nthe context of Title IX.  While the Seventh Circuit’s decision to vacate the panel’s decision in \nHively and to rehear that case en banc technically leaves Ulane in place as the law in this Circuit, \nit does so only barely, in this Court’s view, particularly with respect to the interpretation of Title \nIX.  Unconstrained by Hively’s recent affirmation of Ulane, and with the continued vitality of the \nnarrow,  traditional,  and  biological  view  of  the  term  “sex”  articulated  in  Ulane  subject  to \nquestion, this Court believes the better reasoned recent decisions hold that the term “sex” in Title \nIX can be interpreted to encompass gender identity as DOE has interpreted it.   \n                                                 \n19 Only two district courts have held that one’s “sex” must be determined biologically under Title IX.  \nTexas, 2016 WL 4426495; Johnston v. Univ. of Pittsburgh of Com. Sys. of Higher Educ., 97 F. Supp. 3d \n657, 676 (W.D. Pa. 2015), appeal dismissed (Mar. 30, 2016).  In Johnson, however, the court did not \nconsider whether DOE’s interpretation was entitled to deference and, therefore, that decision is of limited \npersuasive value in this case.  See Highland, 2016 WL 5372349, at *13 n.9.  In Texas, the court decided \nDOE’s interpretation should not be given deference based on a relatively conclusory analysis that this \nCourt finds unpersuasive.  See Texas, 2016 WL 4426495, at *14-15. \n \n35 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 36 of 82 PageID #:1849\n  Under  the  APA,  a  court  must  “hold  unlawful  and  set  aside”  agency  action  that  is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  The APA also says a court must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is \n“in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” Id. at § \n706(2)(C).  Plaintiffs argue that the Rule and the Locker Room Agreement violate the APA \nbecause they are based on an interpretation of Title IX that is “not accordance with” Congress’s \nintent regarding the unambiguous meaning of “sex” and because they likely are “in excess of” \nDOE’s jurisdiction and authority because DOE is not empowered to interpret Title IX contrary to \ncongressional intent.   \n  The foundation for each of Plaintiffs’ arguments, in the Seventh Circuit, is Ulane and \nHively.  Plaintiffs’ rely heavily on these two cases for the premise that Congress intended a very \nnarrow and traditional interpretation of the term “sex” in Title VII and, by implication, in Title \nIX.  Given the discussion above, the Court cannot say that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of success \non the merits of these arguments.  It is far from clear that the narrow interpretation of the term \n“sex”  articulated  32  years  ago  in  Ulane  will  continue  to  inform  the  Seventh  Circuit’s \njurisprudence generally after its en banc review of Hively or, in particular, with respect to \nwhether that term as used in Title IX includes gender identity.   \n  Accordingly, against this legal backdrop and at this early stage of this case, the Court \ncannot say with confidence that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the merits of their \nclaim that the Federal Defendants violated the APA by promulgating the Rule or entering into \nthe Locker Room Agreement based on an interpretation of Title IX that includes gender identity \nwithin the term “sex.”  \n   \n36 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 37 of 82 PageID #:1850\nc.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits Of Their \nOther APA Claims \n \n  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is legislative in nature and, thus, DOE was required to observe \nthe notice-and-comment process.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 11-12]; Plaintiffs’ \nReply Brief, [ECF No. 94, at 4-9].  This argument relies in large part on Plaintiffs’ contention \nthat “sex” in Title IX means biological sex.  Because they have not shown this premise is sound, \nthat flaw significantly undermines the assertion that the Rule is legislative.  \n  Plaintiffs also contend the Rule is legislative because it “contradicts four decades of \nunbroken authority.”  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 11].  A rule is not legislative, \nthough, simply because it reflects a new position of the agency.  Twp., Marion Cty., Ind. v. \nDavila, 969 F.2d 485, 492 (7th Cir. 1992).  Rather, “the APA ‘permit[s] agencies to promulgate \nfreely [interpretive] rules—whether or not they are consistent with earlier interpretations’ of the \nagency’s regulations.”  Ass’n of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO v. Huerta, 785 F.3d 710, 719 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1207 (2015)); see \nalso Dismas Charities, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 401 F.3d 666, 681 (6th Cir. 2005).   \n  Plaintiffs also argue the Rule must be legislative because it impacts legal rights and \nobligations.    An  interpretive  rule,  though,  may  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  rights  of \nindividuals because “‘[t]he impact of a rule has no bearing on whether it is legislative or \ninterpretative; interpretative rules may have a substantial impact on the rights of individuals.’”  \nDavila, 969 F.2d at 493 (quoting Am. Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO v. U.S. Postal Serv., 707 \nF.2d 548, 560 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).  If a rule “cannot be independently legally enforced [because] \nthere must be some external legal basis supporting its implementation,” than it is interpretive.  \nIowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 874 (8th Cir. 2013).  The “critical feature of \ninterpretive rules is that they are ‘issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s \n37 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 38 of 82 PageID #:1851\nconstruction of the statutes and rules which it administers.’”  Perez, 135 S. Ct. at 1204 (quoting \nShalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U.S. 87, 99 (1995)).   \n  It is undisputed that DOE issued the Guidance that contains the Rule in response to \nquestions from school administrators, teachers, and parents.  See Federal Defendants’ Response \nBrief, [ECF No. 80, at 16]; Q&A on Sexual Violence, [ECF No. 21-9, at ii]; Q&A on Single-Sex \nClasses and Extracurricular Activities, [ECF No. 21-8, at 1].  The Guidance details what DOE \nthinks Title IX means.  It does not provide an independent basis for an enforcement action.  \nInstead, any action would have to be grounded in Title IX itself.  Moreover, the specific facts of \nthis case demonstrate DOE does not treat the Guidance as giving rise to the legal obligation to \ntreat transgender students consistent with their gender identity.  DOE began its review of Student \nA’s complaint before any of the challenged Guidance Documents were issued.  And its Letter of \nFindings does not reference or cite the Guidance.  Therefore, the record shows the Guidance was \nissued in response to questions received by DOE to inform schools and the public in general as \nto what schools must do to comply with DOE’s understanding of Title IX.    \n  For these reasons, the Rule is interpretive and need not have been promulgated through \nthe notice-and-comment process.20 \n  In  addition,  Plaintiffs  contend  the  Rule  conflicts  with  Title  IX  and  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional right to privacy.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 10].  As discussed in \nthe subsequent sections of this Report and Recommendation, the Court finds Plaintiffs do not \n                                                 \n20 Plaintiffs note at one point in their briefs that “20 U.S.C. § 1682 provides in part that any ‘rule, \nregulation, or order’ issued by a federal agency to effectuate Title IX must be approved by the President \nin order to become effective.”  Equity In Athletics, Inc. v. Dep’t of Educ., 639 F.3d 91, 106 (4th Cir. \n2011).  Although this argument was not developed and supported, the Court notes that, “[a]s with the \nAPA’s notice and comment requirements, courts have held that the requirement of presidential approval \ndoes not apply to the issuance of interpretive guidelines.”  Id. \n \n38 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 39 of 82 PageID #:1852\nhave a likelihood of success on either of these claims.  This, in turn, undermines that aspect of \nPlaintiffs’ APA claim.21   \n  Plaintiffs assert the Rule violates the Spending Clause of the Constitution because it \npermits the Federal Defendants to pull federal funds for discrimination based on a student’s \ngender identity.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 10-11]; Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief, [ECF \nNo. 94, at 17-18].  Plaintiffs do not dispute that Congress has provided adequate notice that \nfederal funds may be withheld from a school that discriminates in violation of Title IX.  Instead, \nPlaintiffs argue Title IX only prohibits discrimination based on biological sex and, therefore, that \nTitle IX does not provide notice that funding may be withheld for discrimination based on \ngender identity.  As with many of Plaintiffs arguments, this one rests on the meaning of “sex” in \nTitle IX.  And, as the Court already has explained, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden, at this \nstage, to establish clearly they have a probability of success on the merits of that claim. \n  Title IX does not explicitly state that a school may lose its federal funding if it does not \ntake adequate steps to stop discrimination against transgender students.  But a spending condition \nis not unconstitutional simply because its application may be unclear in certain contexts.  Bennett \nv. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 665-66 (1985).  Moreover, Congress need not “specifically” \nidentify and prescribe “each condition in the legislation.”  Parker v. Franklin Cty. Cmty. Sch. \nCorp., 667 F.3d 910, 921 (7th Cir. 2012).  Simply put, “it does not matter that the manner of that \ndiscrimination can vary widely.”  Benning v. Georgia, 391 F.3d 1299, 1306 (11th Cir. 2004).   \n                                                 \n21 Plaintiffs also assert that DOE’s actions violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., and various additional constitutional rights, including the parental right to direct \na child’s upbringing and the right to free exercise of religion.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at \n10].  They never develop or support these arguments.  Instead, Plaintiffs raise them in a conclusory \nsentence or two.  That is not enough.  See United States v. Hook, 471 F.3d 766, 775 (7th Cir. 2006) (“We \nrepeatedly  have  made  clear  that  perfunctory  and  undeveloped  arguments,  and  arguments  that  are \nunsupported by pertinent authority, are waived (even where those arguments raise constitutional issues).”) \n(quoting United States v.

Plaintiffs’ Opening \nBrief, [ECF No. 23, at 9-10]; Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief, [ECF No. 94, at 16-17].  In the Guidance \nand the Letter of Findings, however, DOE extensively cited the provisions of Title IX, its \nregulations, and relevant court decisions.  In the Letter of Findings, DOE also acknowledged the \nprivacy concerns of the various parties; described in detail the layout of the various restrooms \nand locker rooms, with a particular emphasis on the resulting privacy risks; and laid out the \nalternative privacy options. Letter of Findings, [ECF No. 21-10, at 3-13].  In the “Conclusion” \nsection of the Letter of Findings, DOE dedicated a lengthy paragraph solely to explaining how a \nprivacy curtain, coupled with Student A’s stated intention to use the curtain, could adequately \nprotect all “potential or actual student privacy interests.”  Id. at 13.  Plaintiffs have not done \nenough to overcome the “highly deferential” standard of review for arbitrary and capricious \nclaims, under which agency actions are presumed valid.    See Am. Trucking Associations, Inc. v. \nFed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 724 F.3d 243, 245 (D.C. Cir. 2013); see also Judulang v. \nHolder, 132 S. Ct. 476, 483 (2011) (noting that a court must not “‘substitute its judgment for that \nof the agency’”) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. \nAutomobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).   \n  For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs do not have a likelihood of success on the merits of \ntheir claim that the Rule and the Locker Room Agreement violate the APA. \n2.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown They Have A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits \nOf  Their  Constitutional  Claim  Against  Either  The  Federal  Defendants  Or \nDistrict 211 \n \n  Plaintiffs allege a violation of their right to substantive due process.  There is a “basic \nframework” for evaluating substantive due process claims.  Christensen v. Cty. of Boone, Ill., \n40 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 41 of 82 PageID #:1854\n483 F.3d 454, 461 (7th Cir. 2007).  The analysis begins with “a ‘careful description’ of the \n[right] said to have been violated.”  Id. at 462 (quoting Doe v. City of Lafayette, 377 F.3d 757, \n768 (7th Cir. 2004)); see also Second Amendment Arms v. City of Chicago, 135 F. Supp. 3d 743, \n763 (N.D. Ill. 2015).  Then the inquiry turns to whether that right is “fundamental.”  Christensen, \n483 F.3d at 462; Second Amendment Arms, 135 F. Supp. 3d at 763.  If it is, the question becomes \nwhether there is a “direct” and “substantial” interference with a fundamental right.  Christensen, \n483 F.3d at 462; Second Amendment Arms, 135 F. Supp. 3d at 763.  Even if there is such an \ninterference,  the  challenged  action  still  must  “shock[]  the  conscience”  for  there  to  be  a \nconstitutional violation.  Christensen, 483 F.3d at 462; Second Amendment Arms, 135 F. Supp. \n3d at 763. \na.  There Is No General Constitutional Right To Privacy \n  Plaintiffs assert a claim against the Federal Defendants and District 211 for violating their \n“fundamental right to privacy.”  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at p.53].22   In Griswold v. Connecticut, \nthe  Supreme  Court  acknowledged  for  the  first  time  that  the  “penumbras”  of  the  “specific \nguarantees in the Bill of Rights” protect certain privacy interests.  381 U.S. 479, 484 (1965).  But \nthe Supreme Court never has recognized “a generalized right” to privacy in the substantive due \nprocess context.  C.N. v. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 430 F.3d 159, 178 (3d Cir. 2005); see also \n                                                 \n22 Plaintiffs describe the “fundamental right to privacy” they seek to vindicate in this case as “grounded in \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶ 359].  But the Fourteenth \nAmendment does not apply to the federal government.  The Federal Defendants, therefore, couch their \nresponse to Plaintiffs’ claim in the context of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  Federal \nDefendants’ Response Brief, [ECF No. 80, at 26].  The Court will read the Complaint as asserting a claim \nunder both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Both due process clauses “‘guarantee more than fair \nprocess’” and “cover a substantive sphere as well, ‘barring certain government actions regardless of the \nfairness of the procedures used to implement them.’”  Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 840 \n(1998) (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719 (1997); Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, \n331 (1986)).  They also protect the same fundamental rights and are governed by the same legal \nstandards.  See United States v. Al-Hamdi, 356 F.3d 564, 575 n.11 (4th Cir. 2004); Molina-Aviles v. D.C., \n824 F. Supp. 2d 4, 9 n.8 (D.D.C. 2011).  \n41 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 42 of 82 PageID #:1855\nKatz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350 (1967) (explaining that the Fourth Amendment also \ndoes not encompass a “general constitutional ‘right to privacy’”).  Instead, it has extended \nsubstantive due process protection to privacy interests only in limited circumstances.  See, e.g., \nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578  (2003) (recognizing that “‘individual decisions . . . \nconcerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce \noffspring,  are  a  form  of  ‘liberty’  protected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment’”) (quoting Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 188 (1986)); Whalen v. Roe, 429 \nU.S. 558, 578 (1977) (holding that a New York law, which established a database of names and \naddresses of persons who received prescriptions for certain drugs sold on the black market, did \nnot pose an unconstitutional invasion of privacy); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153 (1973) \n(finding that the right to privacy “found[] in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal \nliberty . . . is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision” to terminate a pregnancy); \nGriswold, 381 U.S. at 485-86 (holding that the Fourteenth Amendment confers a right to privacy \nin one’s marital relations and use of contraceptives). \n  The Supreme Court “always [has] been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive \ndue process because guide posts for responsible decision making in this area are scarce and \nopen-ended.”  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720.  “The doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires \n[courts] to exercise the utmost care whenever [they] are asked to break new ground in this field.”  \nReno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993).  Accordingly, the “Supreme Court of the United States \nhas made clear, and [the Seventh Circuit] similarly cautioned, that the scope of substantive due \nprocess is very limited.”  Belcher v. Norton, 497 F.3d 742, 753 (7th Cir. 2007). \n   \n42 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 43 of 82 PageID #:1856\nb.  Plaintiffs Too Broadly Define The Right At Issue In This Case  \n  The first step in the substantive due process analysis is to define carefully the right (or \nrights) at issue in this case.  As the Seventh Circuit has observed, the definition of a substantive \ndue  process  right  is  “constrained  by  the  factual  record  before  [the  court],  which  sets  the \nboundaries  of  the  liberty  interests  truly  at  issue  in  the  case.”    Lafayette,  377  F.3d  at  769 \n(emphasis in original); see also Williams v. Attorney Gen. of Ala., 378 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir. \n2004).  The definition must be “specific and concrete,” avoiding “sweeping abstractions and \ngeneralities.”  Lafayette, 377 F.3d at 769.  Crafting a narrow, focused definition ensures that \ncourts “do not stray into broader ‘constitutional vistas than are called for by the facts of the case \nat hand.’”  Doe v. Moore, 410 F.3d 1337, 1344 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Williams, 378 F.3d at \n1240).  This in turn “tends to rein in the subjective elements that are necessarily present in due-\nprocess judicial review.”  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722.   \n  An  example  is  helpful.    In  Washington  v.  Glucksberg,  the  plaintiff  asserted  as  a \nfundamental right the “liberty to choose how to die,” “a right to control of one’s final days,” and \n“the liberty to shape death.”  Id.  The court of appeals framed the right at issue as “a liberty \ninterest in determining the time and manner of one’s death” and “a right to die.”  Id.  The \nSupreme Court, however, rejected all of these formulations as not specific enough.  Instead, the \nSupreme Court asked whether there was a “right to commit suicide which itself includes a right \nto assistance in doing so.”  Id. at 723; see also Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City, 528 F.3d 762, 770 \n(10th Cir. 2008) (expressing doubt that the definition of a right “to engage in a private act of \nconsensual sex” is narrow enough). \n43 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 44 of 82 PageID #:1857\n  Plaintiffs assert generally that the Restroom Policy and the Locker Room Agreement \nviolate their constitutional “right to privacy.”23  They identify two broad privacy interests they \ncontend are protected by substantive due process.  The first is the “right to privacy in one’s fully \nor partially unclothed body.”  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶ 362]; see also id. at ¶ 393.  The \nsecond is “the right to be free from State-compelled risk of intimate exposure of oneself to the \nopposite sex.”  Id. at ¶ 363; see also id. at ¶ 393.  Plaintiffs’ framing of these rights is not tied to \nthe facts of the case and, therefore, is inconsistent with the Seventh Circuit’s admonition to avoid \n“sweeping abstractions and generalities” in the context of substantive due process analysis.  \nLafayette, 377 F.3d at 769.  \n  For this reason, the Federal Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ articulation of the fundamental \nrights at issue in this case “grossly overstates the interest that they actually seek to vindicate, \nwhich is an alleged right to change [clothes] in a locker room from which transgender students \nare excluded.”  Federal Defendants’ Response Brief, [ECF No. 80, at 3].  When opposing \nDistrict 211’s request for discovery, Plaintiffs also framed their constitutional argument more \nnarrowly than they do in their Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  In their brief in support of \ntheir Motion for Protective Order, Plaintiffs identified the issue to be decided as: “does letting a \nbiological male use the girls’ locker room and restrooms, and so subjecting Girl Plaintiffs to the \n                                                 \n23 Count II of Plaintiffs’ Complaint, which asserts Plaintiffs’ claim that the Federal Defendants and \nDistrict 211 are violating Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, does not mention DOE’s Rule.  Complaint, \n[ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 358-396].  In Count I of the Complaint against the Federal Defendants, Plaintiffs do \nallege the Rule violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to privacy, id. at ¶ 332, and Plaintiffs’ incorporate \nby reference all of their prior allegations into Count II.  In their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin the Restroom Policy and the Locker Room Agreement.  They acknowledged at \noral argument on that Motion that they are only seeking at this time to enjoin the Federal Defendants \n“from further application of the rule to force District 211 to comply with it in the operation of its \nfacilities.”  Oral Argument Transcript, [ECF No. 127, at 155].  The Rule, however, only impacts District \n211 in the context of the Locker Room Agreement.  District 211 put its Restroom Policy into place years \nbefore it heard from OCR in connection with Student A’s complaint about locker room access.  Plaintiffs’ \nwritten arguments in support of their constitutional claims focus on the Restroom Policy and the Locker \nRoom Agreement, and do not reference the Rule at all.  Therefore, the Court need not address in this \nReport and Recommendation whether the Rule, standing alone, violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n44 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 45 of 82 PageID #:1858\nrisk of compelled exposure of their bodies to the opposite biological sex, violate Girl Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional right to privacy?”  Plaintiffs’ Protective Order Brief, [ECF No. 50, at 3].  This is a \nbetter attempt at framing the issue, and it encompasses Plaintiffs’ main claim in this case which \nrevolves around Student A’s access to restrooms and locker rooms also used by Girl Plaintiffs, \nbut it does not account for Plaintiffs’ claim that allowing transgender students to use restrooms \nconsistent with their gender identity violates the privacy rights of both male and female Student \nPlaintiffs. \n  Essentially, in the Court’s view, Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim posits this question: do \nhigh school students have a constitutional right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with \ntransgender students whose sex assigned at birth is different than theirs?  The Court will analyze \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claims in this context.  See Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794 F.3d 1064, \n1087 (9th Cir. 2015) (refining the definition of the right at issue to account for the fact that the \nchallenged conduct applied “only to persons in specific circumstances,” not “generally to the \npopulation as a whole”).    \nc.  High  School  Students  Do  Not  Have  A  Constitutional  Right  Not  To  Share \nRestrooms Or Locker Rooms With Transgender Students Whose Sex Assigned At \nBirth Is Different Than Theirs \n \n  Initially, it is important to note that, for purposes of the constitutional analysis, the Court \nis not bound by the narrow, traditional, and biological understanding of “sex” that the Seventh \nCircuit held in Ulane that Congress codified in Title VII.  Congress’s intent in enacting that \nstatute is irrelevant to the analysis of Plaintiffs’ asserted constitutional right to privacy.  Further, \nin the Court’s view, sex assigned at birth is not the only data point relevant to the question of \nwhether the Constitution precludes a school from choosing to allow transgender students to use \nrestrooms  or  locker  rooms  consistent  with  their  gender  identity.    Rather,  as  the  Federal \n45 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 46 of 82 PageID #:1859\nDefendants and Intervenor-Defendants point out, a transgender person’s gender identity is an \nimportant factor to be considered in determining whether his or her needs, as well as those of \ncisgender people, can be accommodated in the course of allocating or regulating the use of \nrestrooms and locker rooms.  So, to frame the constitutional question in the sense of sex assigned \nat birth while ignoring gender identity frames it too narrowly for the constitutional analysis.   \n  In addition, it also is important to note Plaintiffs are not required—“compelled” in their \nwords, Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 15]—by any state actor to use restrooms or \nlocker rooms with Student A or any other transgender student.  The District’s Restroom Policy \nallows transgender students to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity.  No cisgender \nstudent is compelled to use a restroom with a transgender student if he or she does not want to do \nso.  In addition, District 211 does not require any cisgender girl student to use a locker room with \nStudent A if she does not want to do so.  As discussed more fully below, District 211 has made \nclear that any cisgender high school student who does not want to use a restroom or a locker \nroom with a transgender student is not required to do so.     \n  If the privacy stalls and protections the District provides in restrooms and locker rooms \nare not sufficient for the comfort of any student, whether cisgender, transgender, or otherwise, he \nor she can use an alternative facility that satisfies his or her privacy needs.  See Declaration of \nMark Kovack (“Kovack’s Declaration”), [ECF No. 78-1, at ¶¶ 15-17] (explaining available \nprivacy alternatives include separate, single-use facilities).  In addition, District 211 notified all \nparents that “[s]tudents who seek additional levels of privacy [other than the stalls provided in \nthe communal locker rooms] may request the use of an alternate changing area by contacting \ntheir school counselor.”  Id. at ¶ 15(b).  The absence of any compulsion distinguishes this case \n46 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 47 of 82 PageID #:1860\nfrom  others  Plaintiffs  cite  which,  as  discussed  below,  involve  involuntary  invasions  of \nsomeone’s privacy. \n  Generally speaking, the penumbral rights of privacy the Supreme Court has recognized in \nother contexts protect certain aspects of a person’s private space and decision-making from \ngovernmental intrusion.  Even in the context of the right to privacy in one’s own body, the cases \ndeal with compelled intrusion into or with respect to a person’s intimate space or exposed body.  \nNo case recognizes a right to privacy that insulates a person from coming into contact with \nsomeone who is different than they are, or who they fear will act in a way that causes them to be \nembarrassed or uncomfortable, when there are alternative means for both individuals to protect \nthemselves from such contact, embarrassment, or discomfort. \n  Again,  courts  are  very  careful  in  extending  constitutional  protection  in  the  area  of \npersonal privacy.  “Although the Supreme Court has recognized fundamental rights in regard to \nsome special . . . privacy interests, it has not created a broad category where any alleged \ninfringement on privacy . . . will be subject to substantive due process protection.” Moore, 410 \nF.3d at 1343-44.  In other words, “privacy” is not a magic term that automatically triggers \nconstitutional protection.  Instead, the same rules that govern every other substantive due process \nanalysis apply in the privacy context.  See Jenkins v. Rock Hill Local Sch. Dist., 513 F.3d 580, \n591 (6th Cir. 2008).  That means an asserted privacy right is not fundamental unless it is \n“‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered \nliberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if [it was] sacrificed.’”  Khan v. Bland, \n630 F.3d 519, 535 (7th Cir. 2010) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720-21).  The list of rights \nthat rise to this level is “a short one.”  Sung Park v. Indiana Univ. Sch. of Dentistry, 692 F.3d \n828, 832 (7th Cir. 2012).  This list “‘for the most part’” has been limited to “‘matters relating to \n47 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 48 of 82 PageID #:1861\nmarriage, family, procreation, and the right to bodily integrity.’”  Gibson v. Am. Cyanamid Co., \n760 F.3d  600, 615  (7th Cir. 2014)  (quoting Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 272 (1994) \n(plurality opinion)); see also Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040, 1047 (7th Cir. 1995). \n  In assessing the nature and scope of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and whether those \nrights have been infringed, the Court also must consider the need to preserve the discretion of \nschools  to  craft  individualized  approaches  to  difficult  issues  that  are  appropriate  for  their \nrespective communities.  Schools “have the difficult task of teaching ‘the shared values of a \ncivilized social order.’”  Doninger v. Niehoff, 527 F.3d 41, 54 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Bethel \nSch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 683 (1986)).  Our public education system “has evolved” \nto rely “necessarily upon the discretion and judgment of school administrators and school board \nmembers.” Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 326 (1975); see also Jeffrey v. Bd. of Trustees of \nBells ISD, 261 F. Supp. 2d 719, 728 (E.D. Tex. 2003), aff’d, 96 F. App’x 248 (5th Cir. 2004) \n(“Local  school  boards  have  broad  discretion  in  the  management  of  school  affairs.”).    The \nSupreme Court “has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority \nof the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to \nprescribe and control conduct in the schools.”  Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 \nU.S. 503, 507 (1969).   \n  Even when confronting segregation, perhaps the most intractable problem ever to afflict \nour public schools, the Supreme Court emphasized that schools “have the primary responsibility \nfor elucidating, assessing, and solving” problems that arise during desegregation.  Brown v. Bd. \nof Educ. of Topeka, Kan., 349 U.S. 294, 299 (1955); see also Fisher v. Univ. of Texas at Austin, \n136 S. Ct. 2198, 2214 (2016) (“Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those \nintangible  characteristics,  like  student  body  diversity,  that  are  central  to  its  identity  and \n48 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 49 of 82 PageID #:1862\neducational mission.”).  Therefore, our Nation’s deeply rooted history and tradition of protecting \nschool administrators’ discretion require that this Court not “unduly constrain[] [schools] from \nfulfilling  their  role  as  a  principal  instrument  in  awakening  the  child  to  cultural  values,  in \npreparing him [or her] for later professional training, and in helping him [or her] to adjust \nnormally to his [or her] environment.”  Bannon v. Sch. Dist. of Palm Beach Cty., 387 F.3d 1208, \n1220  (11th  Cir.  2004)  (Black,  J.,  specially  concurring)  (quoting  Hazelwood  Sch.  Dist.  v. \nKuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 287 (1988)).  \nIt also is important to remember that constitutional privacy rights, whether rooted in the \nFourth  Amendment  or  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  “are  different  in  public  schools  than \nelsewhere.”  Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 656 (1995).  “[I]t is well established \nthat public school students enjoy a reduced expectation of privacy in comparison to the public at \nlarge.”  Dominic J. v. Wyoming Valley W. High Sch., 362 F. Supp. 2d 560, 570 (M.D. Pa. 2005).  \nOf particular relevance to this case, public school locker rooms in this country traditionally have \nbeen and remain “not notable for the privacy they afford.”  Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 657. \n  Contemporary notions of liberty and justice are inconsistent with the existence of the \nright to privacy asserted by Plaintiffs and properly framed by this Court.  A transgender boy or \ngirl, man or woman, does not live his or her life in conformance with his or her sex assigned at \nbirth.  The record in this case provides ample evidence of this point.  Intervenor-Defendants \nStudents A, B, and C live, for all intents and purposes, consistent with their gender identity.  \nStudent  A  “live[s]  her  life  full-time  as  a  girl.”    Declaration  of  Parent  A  (“Parent  A’s \nDeclaration”), [ECF No. 32-1, at ¶ 5].  She dresses in girls’ clothes.  Id.  She maintains “a \ntraditionally female hair style . . . and overall appearance.”  Kovack’s Declaration, [ECF No. 78-\n1, at ¶ 7].  She plays on girls’ athletic teams.  Parent A’s Declaration, [ECF No. 32-1, at ¶ 7].  \n49 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 50 of 82 PageID #:1863\nHer legal name is female, and she uses female pronouns to refer to herself.  Id. at ¶ 5.  Her \npassport lists her gender as female.  Id.  Likewise, Student B “live[s] his life full-time as a boy.”  \nParent B’s Declaration, [ECF No. 32-2, at ¶ 5].  He dresses in boys’ clothing and cuts his hair \nshort.  Id.  His legal name is a “traditionally male name,” and he uses male pronouns to refer to \nhimself.  Id.  Student C also lives “life as a boy.”  Parent C’s Declaration, [ECF No. 32-3, at ¶ 5].  \nHe uses male restrooms in public.  Id. at ¶ 10.  His legal name is a “traditionally male name,” and \nhe uses male pronouns to refer to himself.  Id. at ¶ 5.  His state identification card lists his gender \nas male, and his Social Security records do the same.  Id.  \n  Further, people who interact with Students A, B, and C largely treat them consistent with \ntheir gender identity.  In fact, many people who interact with Students A, B, and C on a daily \nbasis may have no idea, and may not care, what sex they were assigned at birth.  Even before \nOCR got involved, District 211 “honored Student A’s request to be treated as female” in every \nrespect other than locker room access.  Letter of Findings, [ECF No. 21-10, at 2].  The District \nallowed her to use the girls’ restrooms.  Kovack’s Declaration, [ECF No. 78-1, at ¶ 9].  All of \nStudent B’s friends and most of his family use male pronouns to refer to him.  Parent B’s \nDeclaration, [ECF No. 32-2, at ¶ 5].  The teachers, administrators, and staff at Student B’s school \n“have made an effort to treat” him “consistent with his gender identity.”  Id. at ¶ 8.  The school \nemployees and Student B’s friends support his use of the boys’ restrooms.  Id. at ¶ 13.

The Restroom Policy permits all students to use restrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity, and the Locker Room Agreement allows only Student A, who identifies and presents as \na female, to use the girls’ locker rooms.  This is not the same as allowing all cisgender boys to \nuse the girls’ facilities or all cisgender girls to use the boys’ facilities.  District 211 has no such \npolicy, and there is no indication it plans to institute such a policy.  Further, speculation that \nsomeone will abuse or violate a school policy, and presumably be subject to discipline for doing \nso, is not a reason to invalidate policies that do not, by their terms, condone such conduct.24   \n                                                 \n24 In a similar vein is Plaintiffs’ allegation in their Complaint that one out of eight high school girls \nreports being a victim of rape according to the Centers for Disease Control.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ \n52 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 53 of 82 PageID #:1866\n  For all these reasons, high school students do not have a fundamental constitutional right \nnot to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender students whose sex assigned at birth is \ndifferent than theirs. \nd.  Plaintiffs Also Have Not Shown The Broad Constitutional Rights They Allege \nExist  Have  Been  Infringed  By  The  Actions  Of  District  211  Or  The Federal \nDefendants \n \n  Even if the Court were to accept that the broad rights to privacy asserted by Plaintiffs—\nthe right to privacy in their fully or partially unclothed bodies and the right to be free from State-\ncompelled risk of intimate exposure of oneself to the opposite sex—are fundamental, Plaintiffs \nstill have not shown those rights have been “directly” and “substantially” infringed in this case.  \nSee Christensen, 483 F.3d at 462; Second Amendment Arms, 135 F. Supp. 3d at 763; Presley v. \nBd. of Sch. Directors of Rankin Sch. Dist. No. 98, 2014 WL 1468087, at *2 (C.D. Ill. Apr. 15, \n2014).  The cases upon which Plaintiffs rely to establish that the facts in this case rise to the level \nof a constitutional violation involve starkly different operative facts, law, and analysis.  None of \nthe cases stand for the proposition that the risk of bodily exposure to a transgender student in a \nhigh school restroom or locker room, particularly given the privacy protections put in place by \nDistrict 211, infringes upon a fundamental right and thereby violates the Constitution. \n  For instance, Plaintiffs cite Doe v. Luzerne County, 660 F.3d 169 (3d Cir. 2011), for the \nproposition that Defendants are violating Plaintiffs’ right to privacy in their unclothed and \npartially clothed bodies.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 13].  In that case, the \nplaintiff, a female deputy sheriff went to a local hospital to use a decontamination shower.  \n                                                                                                                                                             \n270-271].  There is absolutely no evidence in this record that allowing transgender high school students to \nuse restrooms or locker rooms consistent with their gender identity increases the risk of sexual assault.  \nFurther, there are no allegations that during the more than three years transgender students have been \nusing District 211 restrooms consistent with their gender identity, and the portions of two academic years \nduring which Student A has been using the girls’ locker room, there have been any actual or threatened \nsexual assaults as a result of District 211’s policies.  Again, the entirely speculative risk that someone will \ncommit a criminal act is not a reason to invalidate otherwise valid policies.    \n53 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 54 of 82 PageID #:1867\nLuzerne, 660 F.3d at 172.  She took every possible precaution to make sure that no one saw her \nnaked by using a showering room in which no one else was present and closing the door \ncompletely before undressing.  Id. at 172-73.  When she got out of the shower, she realized that \nthere were no towels in the room and wrapped herself in some paper that normally was used to \ncover doctors’ examination tables.  Id. at 173.  Then, while wrapped in the paper, she allowed \nanother female deputy to inspect her to see if any fleas survived the decontamination process.  Id.  \nUnbeknownst to either female deputy, two of their male colleagues opened the closed door and \nsurreptitiously recorded the plaintiff.  Id.  These men later showed the video to other people in \ntheir department and saved the images to a public work computer.  Id. at 173-74.  \n  On  appeal,  the  Third  Circuit  did  not  find  the  plaintiff’s  constitutional  rights  were \nviolated.  Instead, the court of appeals explained that “[p]rivacy claims under the Fourteenth \nAmendment necessarily require fact-intensive and context-specific analyses.”  Id. at 176.  The \nThird Circuit explicitly recognized there is no “rule that a nonconsensual exposure of certain \nanatomical areas constitutes a per se violation.”  Id.  The court of appeals then said that, even in \nlight of the egregious facts in Doe, it still was not clear whether the plaintiff had suffered a \nconstitutional  violation.    Instead,  the  Third  Circuit  determined  a  material  question  of  fact \nremained as to whether certain sensitive parts of the plaintiff’s body were exposed, which could \nhave affected her claim, and it reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its \nopinion.  Id. at 178.   \n  Plaintiffs also rely heavily on Norwood v. Dale Maintenance System, Incorporated, 590 \nF. Supp. 1410 (N.D. Ill. 1984), for the proposition that “compelled cross-sex restroom and locker \nroom use violates” the Constitution.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 15-16.]  In \nNorwood, the female plaintiff, who worked as a restroom attendant on the night shift, sought a \n54 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 55 of 82 PageID #:1868\njob working in a men’s restroom during the day shift.  Norwood, 590 F. Supp. at 1413-14.  Based \nsolely on her gender, she was denied that position.  Id. at 1414-15.  In challenging that decision, \nshe argued she was subjected to sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.  Id. at 1414.  \nNorwood did not raise any constitutional issue.  Instead, the case turned solely on whether sex \nwas a “bona fide occupational qualification” (“BFOQ”) under Title VII for the sought-after \nrestroom attendant job.  Id. at 1415.  While the court’s inquiry regarding this issue involved \nprivacy issues in a vernacular sense, the relevant standard required only a “showing that the \nclients or guests of a particular business would not consent to service by a member of the \nopposite sex, and that the clients or guests would stop patronizing the business if members of the \nopposite sex were allowed to perform the service.”  Id. at 1416.  The burden on an employer to \nestablish a BFOQ defense based on the level of privacy it wants to afford to its clientele is \ndifferent, and substantially less demanding, than the burden on Plaintiffs here to establish the \nexistence of a constitutionally protected right.  Therefore, Norwood simply does not shed any \nlight on Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n  This Court also is not persuaded by Plaintiffs’ reliance on Kohler v. City of Wapakoneta, \n381 F. Supp. 2d 692 (N.D. Ohio 2005).  Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief, [ECF No. 94, at 21.]  In Kohler, \nthe plaintiff, a police dispatcher, was shown a pornographic picture by a colleague who later \nbecame the Chief of Police and found another pornographic image anonymously left on her \ncomputer.  Kohler, 381 F. Supp. 2d at 697.  The future Chief of Police also told the plaintiff that \nshe could buy used women’s underwear online, sent her multiple offensive emails, hid a tape \nrecorder in a toilet stall in the women’s restroom, and circulated an old photo of the plaintiff to \nnumerous people.  Id.  After being victimized by this misconduct, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit \nasserting, in part, that she suffered a violation of her substantive due process right to privacy.  Id. \n55 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 56 of 82 PageID #:1869\nat 698.  The court, however, never addressed the merits of this claim.  Instead, the court \ndiscussed various procedural grounds related to Plaintiffs’ constitutional privacy claim.  Id. at \n710-13.  And, in the end, the court actually granted summary judgment in favor of all the \ndefendants on that claim.  Id. at 713. \n  Plaintiffs further cite cases that involve unwarranted aggressive touching of unclothed \nbody parts by members of the opposite sex.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief [ECF No. 23, at 13] (citing \nSafford Unified Sch. District No. 1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364 (2009) (search of a student’s bra \nand underpants); Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d 1117 (4th Cir. 1981) (forceful removal of a student’s \nunderwear)).  They also rely upon cases holding that governmentally-compelled exposure of \none’s body to members of the opposite sex, such as school administrators and prison guards, may \nviolate  the  Fourth  Amendment’s  prohibition  against  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures.  \nPlaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 13-14] (citing Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183, 185 \n(7th Cir. 1994) (strip search by members of the opposite sex); Cornfield v. Consolidated High \nSchool District 230, 991 F.3d 1316, 1320 (7th Cir. 1993) (same)).   \n  The Fourth Amendment cases cited by Plaintiffs simply are not relevant to this case.  \nPlaintiffs do not allege, nor can they, that the Restroom Policy or the Locker Room Agreement \nresults in any search or seizure that implicates Fourth Amendment privacy interests.  Rather, \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claim is premised solely on the substantive due process clauses.  While \nthe Fourth Amendment generally requires that a government’s intrusion on privacy through a \nsearch or a seizure must be reasonable, substantive due process does not impose a similar \nrestriction.    Instead,  substantive  due  process  applies  in  very  limited  circumstances  when \nfundamental rights are implicated.  \n56 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 57 of 82 PageID #:1870\n  This case, moreover, does not involve the extreme invasions of privacy that the courts \nconfronted in the cases cited by Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have not alleged any students, whether \nStudent A, any other transgender student, or any Student Plaintiff, ever were in each other’s \npresence in an unclothed state.  In fact, Plaintiffs’ counsel disclaimed that is central or even \nrelevant to Plaintiffs’ case:  “who saw who in the state of undress or naked . . . is not relevant . . . \nat the preliminary injunction stage.  We don’t need to prove that.  We didn’t allege that in the \ncomplaint, nor do we rely on it at the preliminary injunction stage.”  June 9 Hearing Transcript, \n[ECF No. 128, at 18].  Plaintiffs also do not allege that any transgender student, including \nStudent A, and  any Student Plaintiff ever  saw an intimate part of the other’s body.   The \nunderlying facts of this case are entirely unlike the surreptitious recordings, strip searches, and \naggressive body touchings that courts have found unconstitutional in certain circumstances.25 \n  This case also does not involve the type of forced invasion of privacy that animated the \ncases cited by Plaintiffs.  The restrooms and the physical education locker room at Fremd High \nSchool have traditional privacy stalls that can be used when toileting, changing clothes, and \nshowering.  Kovack’s Declaration, [ECF No. 78-1, at ¶¶ 8, 15].  There is no reason why a \nstudent who does not want to do so would have to take off clothing or reveal an intimate part of \nhis or her body outside of the private stalls.  Inside the stalls, there is no meaningful risk that any \npart of a student’s unclothed body would be seen by another person.  Therefore, these protections \n                                                 \n25 The only allegations in Plaintiffs’ Complaint that even remotely touch on the risk of actual exposure of \nany body part are the vague references to Student A lifting up her shirt one time in a common area of the \ngirls’ locker rooms and her changing clothes in the gymnastics locker room when one or more girls (not \nnecessarily Girl Plaintiffs, which is not alleged) “were present.”  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 96, 135].  \nNo details are provided about what part of Student A’s body, if any, was revealed on either of these \noccasions.  And, when District 211 sought discovery into these incidents, Plaintiffs successful opposed it, \narguing  that  for  purposes  of  their  preliminary  injunction  motion,  actual  locker  room  or  restroom \ninteractions were irrelevant.   \n57 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 58 of 82 PageID #:1871\nalmost entirely mitigate any potential risk of unwanted exposure either by or to any Student \nPlaintiff.   \nFurther,  District  211  has  informed  parents  and  students  that  additional  privacy \nalternatives, beyond the stalls, are available upon request.  Id. at ¶ 15(b).  These include separate, \nsingle-use facilities for male and female students who do not want to use the common locker \nrooms or restrooms.  Id. at ¶ 17.  Any Student Plaintiff who uses the alternative facilities has no \nmeaningful risk of either seeing or being seen by a student in a state of undress or seeing an \nintimate part of his or her body.  In light of these privacy protections and alternatives, any \nStudent Plaintiff who does not want to risk exposure of his or her body to a transgender student \nhas the ability to change clothes and shower in a private space.  Put simply, this case does not \ninvolve any forced or involuntary exposure of a student’s body to or by a transgender person \nassigned a different sex at birth. \n  For all of these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are not suffering a “direct” and \n“substantial” infringement on any substantive due process right.   \ne.  Defendants’ Actions Do Not Shock The Conscience \n \n  Even  if  the  Restroom  Policy  and  the  Locker  Room  Agreement  did  directly  and \nsubstantially  infringe  upon  a  fundamental  right,  that  alone  would  not  render  them \nunconstitutional under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments.  The Restroom Policy and the \nLocker Room Agreement would not be unconstitutional unless they require something that \n“shock[s] the conscience.”  Christensen, 483 F.3d at 462 n.2.  “[T]he meaning of this standard \nvaries  depending  on  the  factual  context.”    United  Artists  Theatre  Circuit,  Inc.  v.  Twp.  of \nWarrington, PA, 316 F.3d 392, 400 (3d Cir. 2003).  Courts variously have described conscience-\nshocking conduct as that which “violates the decencies of civilized conduct; . . . is so brutal and \n58 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 59 of 82 PageID #:1872\noffensive that it does not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency; . . . interferes \nwith rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty; [or] . . . is so egregious, so outrageous, that \nit may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”  Doe ex rel. Magee v. Covington \nCty. Sch. Dist. ex rel. Keys, 675 F.3d 849, 867 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting City of Sacramento, 523 \nU.S. at 846-47 & n. 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under all of these formulations, the \nconduct  must  go  “beyond  merely  ‘offending  some  fastidious  squeamishness  or  private \nsentimentalism.’”  Smith ex rel. Smith v. Half Hollow Hills Cent. Sch. Dist., 298 F.3d 168, 173 \n(2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 n.6 (2d Cir. 1973), partially \nabrogated on other grounds by Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989)).  “Only ‘the most \negregious official conduct’ will satisfy this stringent inquiry.”  Jackson v. Indian Prairie Sch. \nDist. 204, 653 F.3d 647, 654 (7th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cty. of Sacramento, 523 U.S. at 846); see \nalso  Tun  v.  Whitticker,  398  F.3d  899,  902  (7th  Cir.  2005)  (“Cases  abound  in  which  the \ngovernment  action—though  thoroughly  disapproved  of—was  found  not  to  shock  the \nconscience.”).  \n  Plaintiffs never address whether the Restroom Policy and the Locker Room Agreement \nshock the conscience.  Instead, Plaintiffs argue those policies cannot pass muster under a strict \nscrutiny test.  As noted above, that standard applies to legislative enactments.  Christensen, 483 \nF.3d at 462 n.2.  The executive actions at issue in this case must shock the conscience to violate \nsubstantive due process.  Id.  And the Fourth Amendment cases cited throughout Plaintiffs’ \nbriefs, and upon which they rely, simply are not relevant to this issue because “the Fourth \nAmendment invokes the less stringent reasonableness standard.”  Gottlieb ex rel. Calabria v. \nLaurel Highlands Sch. Dist., 272 F.3d 168, 171 (3d Cir. 2001). \n59 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 60 of 82 PageID #:1873\n  Neither the Restroom Policy nor the Locker Room Agreement shocks the conscience.  \nDistrict 211 is legally responsible for providing an effective learning environment for over \n12,000 students.  See Defendant Board of Education of Township High School District No. 211’s \nResponse to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“District 211’s Response Brief”), \n[ECF No. 78, at 1, 10]  It determined that allowing all students to use restrooms consistent with \ntheir gender identity would improve the educational environment of its students.  In reaching this \nconclusion, District 211 recognized isolating transgender students in separate facilities against \ntheir will could, and did, at least in the case of Student A, negatively impact their experience in \nschool.  The District decided that remedying this harm by offering appropriate restroom access \nwould  not  infringe  on  the  privacy  of  other  students  because  the  privacy  protections  and \nalternatives sufficiently protected all students’ privacy in the restrooms.  Kovack’s Declaration, \n[ECF No. 78-1, at ¶ 9].  \n  After District 211 instituted the Restroom Policy, roughly three years elapsed before \nPlaintiffs challenged it.  If Student Plaintiffs did not know they were using restrooms with \ntransgender students during this three-year period, it is hard to say this is a conscience shocking \npolicy. Alternatively, if some Student Plaintiffs were aware transgender students were using \nrestrooms consistent with their gender identity during that time and did not complain about it, \nthen it also is hard to say that state of affairs shocks the conscience.26   \n  The Locker Room Agreement represents the same balancing of interests as the Restroom \nPolicy.  Before District 211 and DOE entered into the Agreement, DOE conducted a lengthy \n                                                 \n26 Girl Plaintiffs allege they “frequently run into Student A when they use the schools’ restrooms.”  \nComplaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶ 231]; see also id. at ¶¶ 232-234].  It is not clear from the Complaint whether \nthis occurred before or only after District 211 publicly announced in October 2015 that transgender \nstudents had been using restrooms consistent with their gender identity since 2013.  In any event, the \nseven-month delay between the District’s announcement that transgender students were being permitted \nto use restrooms consistent with their gender identity and the filing of this lawsuit in May 2016, also \nmilitates against a finding that this state of affairs shocks the conscience.       \n60 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 61 of 82 PageID #:1874\nfactual investigation.  The resulting Letter of Findings describes in great detail what harm \nStudent A was suffering because of her lack of access to the girls’ locker rooms.  See generally \nLetter of Findings, [ECF No. 21-10].  The Letter also discusses what facilities are available at \nFremd High School, when and how students use those facilities, and what can be done to protect \ntheir privacy.  Id.  The Locker Room Agreement requires District 211 to provide significant \nprivacy  protections,  and  District  211  has  promised  to  provide  alternative  facilities  already \nmentioned upon request.  Ultimately, District 211 and DOE, both of which are tasked with \nadvancing and protecting the health, safety and educational environment of all students, at a time \nwhen they were potential litigation adversaries, decided that the Locker Room Agreement served \nthe students at Fremd High School well enough to justify entering into it.  Therefore, the Court \nfinds that neither the Restroom Policy nor the Locker Room Agreement shocks the conscience \nbecause they represent a careful and sensitive balancing of the interests of all the students in \nDistrict 211. \n  For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs have not shown they have a likelihood of success on \nthe merits of their claim that the Restroom Policy and the Locker Room Agreement violate their \nconstitutional right to privacy. \n3.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown They Have A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits \nOf Their Title IX Claims \n \n  Plaintiffs’  argument  for  preliminary  injunctive  relief  under  Title  IX  focuses  on  two \nissues: (1) whether the Restroom Policy and the Locker Room Agreement create a hostile \nenvironment  for  Student  Plaintiffs  in  violation  of  Title  IX;  and  (2)  whether  District  211’s \ndecision to allow Student A to use the girls’ locker rooms when boys do not have to share access \nto the boys’ locker rooms with a transgender student, even with the alternative facilities the \nDistrict  offers  for  girls  seeking  additional  privacy,  violates  a  regulation  promulgated  to \n61 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 62 of 82 PageID #:1875\nimplement  Title  IX  that  provides  that  sex-segregated  facilities  must  be  comparable.    See \nPlaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 18]; Plaintiffs’ Protective Order Brief, [ECF No. 50, \nat 3].  As discussed below, Plaintiffs have not shown they are likely to prevail on either of these \narguments.  \na.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown They Are Suffering Discrimination On The Basis Of \nSex \n  \n  There is a threshold question under Title IX—whether the harassment Plaintiffs allege \nthey are suffering properly can be characterized as sexual harassment, or discrimination on the \nbasis of sex.  See Burwell v. Pekin Community High Sch. Dist. 303, 213 F. Supp. 2d 917, 930 \n(C.D. Ill. 2002); see also C.R.K. v. U.S.D., 176 F. Supp. 2d 1145, 1163 (D. Kan. 2001); Manfredi \nv. Mount Vernon Bd. of Educ., 94 F. Supp. 2d 447, 453-56 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).  To be actionable \nunder Title IX, the offensive behavior must be “on the basis of sex.”  See Frazier v. Fairhaven \nSchool Community, 276 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir. 2002); Benjamin v. Metropolitan Sch. Dist. of \nLawrence Township, 2002 WL 977661, at *3 (S.D. Ind. 2002). \n  Here, Plaintiffs complain that the Restroom Policy and the Locker Room Agreement \ncreate a hostile environment.  But Girl Plaintiffs are not being targeted or singled out by District \n211 on the basis of their sex, nor are they being treated any different than boys who attend school \nwithin District 211.  The Restroom Policy applies to all restrooms.  That means cisgender boys \nuse the boys’ restrooms with transgender boys just like cisgender girls use the girls’ restrooms \nwith transgender girls.  District 211 also has made clear that it will allow transgender boys to use \nthe boys’ locker rooms and will provide the same privacy protections in the boys’ locker rooms \nas exist in the girls’ locker rooms, if requested.  See District 211’s Response Brief, [ECF No. 78, \nat 22 n.9].  Therefore, the alleged discrimination and hostile environment that Girl Plaintiffs \nclaim to experience is not on the basis of their sex, and any discomfort Girl Plaintiffs allege they \n62 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 63 of 82 PageID #:1876\nfeel is not the result of conduct that is directed at them because they are female.  All of Plaintiffs’ \nTitle IX claims suffer from this threshold problem.   \nb.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown The Alleged Harassment Is Severe, Pervasive Or \nObjectively Offensive \n \n  In addition, to establish a hostile environment under Title IX, “a plaintiff must establish \nsexual harassment . . . that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively  offensive, and that so \nundermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are \neffectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities.”  Davis, Next \nFriend LaShona D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 651-52 (1999); Doe v. \nGalster, 768 F.3d 611, 617 (7th Cir. 2014).  Plaintiffs argue that the presence of and risk of \nexposure to transgender students in restrooms and Student A’s presence, and the risk of exposure \nto or by Student A, in the girls’ locker rooms, is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive \nconduct that subjects them to a hostile environment in violation of Title IX.  The facts of record \ndo not support these propositions, and Plaintiffs do not cite any persuasive authority for this legal \nconclusion.   \n  Plaintiffs’ Complaint is long on conclusory statements but sparse on specific facts.  As \nnoted above, Plaintiffs allege generally and repeatedly that District 211’s Restroom Policy and \nthe Locker Room Agreement cause Student Plaintiffs “embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, \napprehension, stress, degradation, and loss of dignity.”  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 11, 124, \n129, 136, 191, 205, 208, 210, 226].    Girl Plaintiffs say they are fearful of sharing facilities with \nand attending to personal needs in the presence of transgender students.  Id. at ¶¶ 8, 10.  Girl \nPlaintiffs also say they are afraid, worried and embarrassed about the possibility of seeing or \nbeing seen by Student A while in a state of undress.  Id. at ¶¶ 8, 9, 114, 126, 127, 186, 187.  They \nassert that their distress is “ever-present” and constant.”  Id. at ¶¶ 114, 115, 125, 237.  Nowhere, \n63 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 64 of 82 PageID #:1877\nhowever, do Plaintiffs allege they ever have seen Student A undressed or that Student A has seen \nany  Girl  Plaintiff  undressed  if  that  Student  Plaintiff  wanted  not  to  be  seen  in  that  state.  \nMoreover, the risk of that occurring is very low given the privacy protections put in place by \nDistrict 211, the alternative facilities available for any student who does not want to use the \ncommon restrooms or locker rooms, and Student A’s undertakings in the locker room agreement \nconcerning her use of the girls’ locker room.    \n  Generalized  statements  of  fear  and  humiliation  are  not  enough  to  establish  severe, \npervasive or objectively offensive conduct.  General allegations have been held to be insufficient \nto establish a Title IX violation.  See, e.g., Trentadue v. Redmon, 619 F.3d 648, 654 (7th Cir. \n2010) (finding undeveloped allegations of student-on-student harassment cannot establish a Title \nIX claim); Gabrielle M. v. Park Forest-Chicago Heights, Ill. Sch. Dist. 163, 315 F.3d 817, 822 \n(7th Cir. 2003) (finding accusation that a student did “nasty stuff” is insufficient to state a Title \nIX). \ni.  The mere presence of transgender students in restrooms or locker rooms \n  is not severe, pervasive, or objectively offensive conduct \n \n  It is important to recognize that Title IX does not say schools cannot allow males and \nfemales to use the same restrooms or locker rooms under any circumstances.  “Title IX is a \nbroadly  written  general  prohibition  on  [sex]  discrimination,  followed  by  specific,  narrow \nexceptions to that broad prohibition.”  Jackson, 544 U.S. at 175.  One of those exceptions says \nthat a school “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, \nbut  such  facilities  provided  for  students  of  one  sex  shall  be  comparable  to  such  facilities \nprovided for students of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  Nowhere does Title IX or its \nregulations  say  that  schools  must  provide  single-sex  facilities.    During  oral  argument  on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs’ counsel conceded that Title IX is written \n64 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 65 of 82 PageID #:1878\npermissively with respect to single-sex facilities.  Oral Argument Transcript, [ECF No. 127, at \n34].  Title IX does not require schools to provide separate facilities; it allows schools to do so as \nlong as they provide comparable facilities for males and females.  In other words, Title IX \npermits  schools  to  decide  whether  to  have  sex-segregated  restrooms,  and  gender-neutral \nrestrooms do not per se violate Title IX as long as all students’ privacy interests are protected.  \nTherefore, the foundation upon which Plaintiffs build much of their Title IX argument—that it is \na violation of Title IX for a biological boy to use a restroom also used by a biological girl under \nany circumstances—does not hold the weight Plaintiffs place on it.   \n  The mere presence of a transgender student in a restroom or locker room does not rise to \nthe level of conduct that has been found to be objectively offensive, and therefore hostile, in \nother cases.  See, e.g., Davis, 526 U.S. at 653 (holding that over a period of five months, a fifth-\ngrade male student harassed the plaintiff, a fifth-grade female student, by engaging in sexually \nsuggestive  behavior,  including  attempting  to  touch  the  plaintiff's  breasts  and  genital  area, \nrubbing against the plaintiff and making vulgar statements); Vance v. Spencer County Public \nSchool Dist., 231 F.3d 253, 259-60 (6th Cir. 2000) (finding that a female student was repeatedly \npropositioned, groped and threatened and was also stabbed in the hand; during one incident, two \nboys held her hands while other male students grabbed her hair and started yanking off her shirt); \nMurrell v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo., 186 F.3d 1238, 1243-44 (10th Cir. 1999) (finding \nthat a disabled female student was sexually assaulted by a male student on multiple occasions); \nSeiwert v. Spencer-Owen Community School Corporation, 497 F. Supp. 2d 942, 953 (S.D. Ind. \n2007) (holding that the alleged harassment suffered by a male eighth-grade student, which \nincluded being called “faggot,” being kicked by several boys during a dodge ball game, and \nreceiving death threats, if proven, amounted to severe and pervasive conduct that was objectively \n65 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 66 of 82 PageID #:1879\noffensive); Bruning ex rel. v. Carrol County Sch. Dist., 486 F. Supp. 2d 892, 917 (N.D. Iowa \n2007) (finding repeated acts of touching and sexual groping were objectively offensive); Snelling \nv.  Fall  Mountain  Regional  Sch.  Dist.,  2001  WL  276975,  at    *1-3  (D.N.H.  2001)  (finding \nwidespread peer harassment, both verbal and physical, which involved referring to the plaintiff \nas a homosexual, as well as some harassment by coaches); see also Cruzan v. Special Sch. Dist. \nNo. 1., 294 F.3d 981, 983 (8th Cir. 2002) (finding mere presence of transgender female teacher \nin women’s faculty restroom did not create a hostile environment for cisgender female teachers).   \n  Plaintiffs rely on People v. Grunau, 2009 WL 5149857 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 29, 2009), \nwhich  Plaintiffs  acknowledge  is  an  unpublished  opinion  that  is  not  to  be  cited  under  the \nCalifornia Rules of Courts.  In that case, a man with two previous convictions for sexually \nmolesting a 5-year-old girl and a 10-year-old girl was caught staring at a teenager showering in a \nlocker room.  Grunau has absolutely nothing in common with this case.  \n  In addition, Plaintiffs cite New Jersey Division of Youth & Family Services v. M.R., 2014 \nWL 1977014 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Feb. 25, 2014), for the proposition that “allowing [a] \nteen girl to be unclothed and shower with a biological male risked mental and emotional injury.”  \nPlaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 22].  In that case, however, the biological male who \nshowered with the girl was her father, who also was accused of having sexual relations with his \nunder-aged niece.  M.R., 2014 WL 1977014, at *1.  Again, this case is not remotely similar. \n  Plaintiffs’  Title  VII  cases  similarly  are  inapposite  and  improperly  equate  allowing \ntransgender students to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity and a transgender girl \nto use the girls’ locker rooms with sexual deviancy.  Plaintiffs cite Lewis v. Triborough Bridge \nand Tunnel Authority, 31 F. App’x 746 (2nd Cir. 2002), which is another decision that is \nunpublished and does not have any precedential effect, for the proposition that the defendant  \n66 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 67 of 82 PageID #:1880\ncompany created a hostile environment when it allowed male cleaners inside the women’s locker \nroom while female employees were changing clothes.  Plaintiffs, however, omit that the cleaning \nservice employees were leering at the female plaintiff and would crowd the entrance of the \nlocker room, forcing her to “run the gauntlet” and physically brush up against them.  Lewis v. \nTriborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, 77 F. Supp. 2d 376, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).  And the \nsupervisor used lewd and objectively offensive words when referring to the employees who \ncomplained of the conduct.  Id. at 378.  Nothing of that sort is alleged to have occurred in this \ncase. \nii.  Any risk of unwanted exposure is mitigated effectively by the privacy \nprotections and alternatives provided by District 211 \n  Plaintiffs maintain that the presence of a transgender student in a restroom or locker room \nwith cisgender students violates Title IX because it creates a risk that students will see each other \nin an unclothed or partially clothed state by virtue of their sharing these facilities, and that is a \nsevere, pervasive and objectively offensive hostile environment.  The risk of unwanted exposure \nin this case, however, is substantively mitigated and reduced by the privacy protections that \nDistrict 211 provides in the restrooms and locker rooms, and by the alternative facilities it \nprovides for students who do not want to use the common facilities. \n  District 211 agreed in the Locker Room Agreement to install and maintain “sufficient \nprivacy curtains (private changing stations) within the girls’ locker rooms to accommodate . . . \nany students who wish to be assured of privacy while changing.”  Locker Room Agreement, \n[ECF No. 21-3, at 3].  The District has installed 13 private stalls, a curtained shower, and privacy \ncurtains  on  two  pre-existing  private  changing  and  showering  stalls  in  the  girls’  physical \neducation locker room at Fremd High School.  Kovack’s Declaration, [ECF No. 78-1, at ¶ \n67 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 68 of 82 PageID #:1881\n15(a)].27  The record shows that District 211 also has installed private changing stalls in the \nboys’ locker room at Fremd High School.  Id.  The District agreed to provide “reasonable \nalternative[s]”  to  female  students  who  request  “additional  privacy  .  .  .  beyond  the  private \nchanging stations,” including use of a single-use facility.  Locker Room Agreement, [ECF No. \n21-3, at 3].  Separate from the Locker Room Agreement, District 211 has informed parents that \n“an alternative changing area” will be made available upon request.  Kovack’s Declaration, [ECF \nNo. 78-1, at ¶ 15(b)].  \n  Plaintiffs allege there are no privacy stalls for changing clothes or showering in the girls’ \nswim or gymnastics locker rooms.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 172, 174].  The District does \nnot appear to dispute this fact.   But Student A has completed her swim requirements for \ngraduation, and she informed OCR that she did not intend to take any more physical education \nclasses that include swimming.  Letter of Findings, [ECF No. 21-10, at 6].  Therefore, the fact \nthat there are no privacy options available in the swim locker room is not enough for Plaintiffs to \nsatisfy their burden of showing a likelihood of success that the District’s failure to provide \nprivacy options in that locker room is severe, pervasive or objectively offensive conduct.  There \nare no allegations, let alone evidence, that Student A is using or intends to use the swim locker \nroom to change her clothes or that other students are forced to change their clothes in the swim \nlocker room when Student A is or will be present.   The mere risk that Student A might change \nclothes or shower in the girls’ swim locker room when she has no reason to be there and is not \n                                                 \n27 Plaintiffs allege that there are five privacy stalls in the physical education locker room for students to \nchange their clothes.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶ 138].  The conflict appears to be that the District’s \nreference is to privacy stalls for changing clothes and showering while Plaintiffs’ reference only is to \nprivacy stalls for changing clothes.   \n \n68 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 69 of 82 PageID #:1882\nenrolled in any required swim class does not create or contribute to a severe, pervasive or \nobjectively offensive hostile environment.28   \n  In addition, although Plaintiffs allege there are open pole showers and no privacy curtains \nfor changing clothes in the girls’ gymnastics locker room, they do not allege that any girls, or \nmore specifically Girl Plaintiffs, use the showers, or want to use the showers but cannot do so \nbecause Student A is present.  To the contrary, in the Letter of Findings, OCR said girls on the \ngymnastics team do not shower in the gymnastics locker room.  Letter of Findings, [ECF No. 21-\n10, at 7].    So, the only issue in the gymnastics locker rooms appears to be that there are no \nprivacy stalls available for students to use when changing into or out of their uniforms.  Girl \nPlaintiffs allege Student A changed clothes in the gymnastics locker room once “while girls were \npresent.”  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶ 96].  Plaintiffs, however, do not allege any Girl Plaintiff \nwas present on this occasion nor do they allege any Girl Plaintiff, or any other girl, saw any \nprivate part of Student A’s body or even that any part of her body was visible on that occasion.  \nThis  is  not  evidence  of  a  severe,  pervasive,  or  objectively  offensive  hostile  environment.  \nMoreover, students who do not want to change or shower in the swim or gymnastics locker \nrooms can use the physical education locker room, which provides privacy protections, or an \nalternative facility, including a single-use space. \n  Plaintiffs also allege a number of other girls’ athletic team locker rooms in the high \nschool “are open to a male student’s use.”  Id. at ¶ 190.  But there is nothing specific pled in the \nComplaint or anywhere in the record to indicate that District 211 would allow cisgender boy \nstudents to have access to the girls’ team locker rooms or that any transgender girl wants or \nintends to use any of those locker rooms.  A hostile environment and allegations of severe, \n                                                 \n28 There is no allegation, evidence or argument that any other transgender girl student uses or intends to \nuse the swimming locker room.   \n69 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 70 of 82 PageID #:1883\npervasive  and  objectively  offensive  conduct  have  to  be  based  on  something  more  than \nspeculation and conjecture. \n  Finally, according to Girl Plaintiffs, they are ridiculed and harassed by their classmates if \nthey choose to change clothes in the privacy stalls provided in the girls’ physical education \nlocker room.  Id. at ¶¶ 140-147.  Plaintiffs do not allege that District 211 was aware of this \ninappropriate conduct before the Complaint was filed (no complaint to the administration, for \nexample, is alleged) nor is it clear that the District’s policies are responsible for this alleged \nconduct by Girl Plaintiffs’ classmates.  In any event, this isolated or sporadic conduct is not the \nkind of severe, pervasive, objectively offensive conduct that has been held to violate Title IX.  \n  Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Restroom Policy also is short on facts necessary to show a \nhostile environment.  There are private toilet stalls in the restrooms.  Even considering the \nalleged gaps in the stalls above and below the doors, and on the sides of the doors, there is \nnothing objectively offensive about Girl Plaintiffs having to use the restroom when Student A \nalso  is  using  the  restroom,  or  about  any  Student  Plaintiff  using  the  same  restroom  as  a \ntransgender student whose sex assigned at birth is different than theirs.  There is nothing to \nindicate that the gaps in the stalls make it likely or even possible for someone to observe \nanything that occurs in the stall if the person inside the stall does not want that to happen.  There \nare no allegations that Student A, or any other transgender student, has harassed anyone in the \nrestroom other than by her mere presence.  Moreover, there undoubtedly are remedies within the \nschools for situations when any student acts in a threatening, harassing, or inappropriate way in a \nrestroom.  See also Cruzan, 294 F.3d at 984 (“We agree with the district court that Cruzan failed \nto show the school district’s policy allowing [a transgender female teacher] to use the women’s \n70 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 71 of 82 PageID #:1884\nfaculty restroom created a working environment that rose to the level of [sexual harassment or a \nhostile environment].”).   \n  In summary, the allegations in Plaintiffs’ Complaint are not comparable to the type of \nconduct that has been found to be severe, pervasive and objectively offensive in violation of Title \nIX.  The Court is not persuaded that there is anything objectively offensive about a transgender \nstudent being present in a restroom or Student A being present in a locker room when at no time \nis his or her unclothed body exposed to any Student Plaintiff, the risk of that happening is \nsubstantially mitigated by the various privacy protection put in place by District 211 and Student \nA’s undertakings in the Locker Room Agreement, and any Student Plaintiff who does not want \nto expose his or her body to a transgender student or anyone else is not compelled to do so.  The \nrisk of an unwanted exposure under these circumstances is minimal and not so severe, pervasive, \nor objectively offensive as to constitute a hostile environment much less a hostile environment \nthat denies any Student Plaintiff access to any educational benefits. \niii.  There  is  no  evidence  Girl  Plaintiffs  have  been  denied  access  to  any \neducational opportunities or benefits \n  Finally, Plaintiffs assert in a conclusory and generalized manner that the Locker Room \nAgreement and the Restroom Policy “have had and continue to have a profoundly negative effect \nof  the  girls’  access  to  educational  opportunities,  benefits,  programs,  and  activities  at  their \nschools.”  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶ 12].  Plaintiffs give five examples: (1) some girls avoid \nthe locker rooms;  (2) one girl wears her gym clothes underneath her regular clothes; (3) other \ngirls change quickly in the locker rooms and avoiding all conversation and eye contact; (4) some \ngirls avoid the restrooms as long as possible; and (5) other girls spend time trying to find an \nempty restroom and therefore risk being tardy to class.  Id.  There are, however, no specific \n71 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 72 of 82 PageID #:1885\nallegations that Plaintiffs have been excluded from “participation in” or “denied the benefits of” \nany education opportunity, class or program as required by Title IX.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n  An action under Title IX lies only when the behavior at issue denies a victim equal access \nto education.  Davis, 526 U.S. at 652.  The harassment must have a “concrete, negative effect” \non the victim’s education.  Id. at 654.  Examples of a negative impact on access to education may \ninclude dropping grades, id. at 634, becoming homebound or hospitalized due to harassment, see \nMurrell, 186 F.3d at 1248-49, and suffering physical violence, see Vance, 231 F.3d at 259.  \n  Here, there is no evidence Girl Plaintiffs have been denied access to any educational \nopportunity or benefit.  Plaintiffs do not allege, for instance, they have stopped going to gym \nclass, quit an extracurricular activity, started getting lower grades, or struggled to focus during \nclass.  Instead, the only effect on their educational opportunities they identify is the risk of \nrunning late to class when using more remote restrooms and locker rooms they think will not be \nused by a transgender student.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 12(e), 236].  There is no indication \nPlaintiffs  actually  have  missed  meaningful  class  time  and  that  this  in  turn  has  negatively \nimpacted their education.  Therefore, they have not shown they have been denied equal access to \nany educational activities or programs.   \n  Accordingly,  for  all  of  these  reasons,  the  Court  is  not  persuaded  Plaintiffs  have  a \nlikelihood of success in establishing a hostile environment in violation of Title IX based on \ntransgender students use of the same high school restrooms as Student Plaintiffs, or Student A’s \nuse of the girls’ locker rooms. \nc.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown The Facilities Are Not Comparable \n \n  By allowing Student A to use the girls’ locker rooms at Fremd High School, Plaintiffs \nargue the locker room facilities for the girls provided by District 211 are inferior to the facilities \n72 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 73 of 82 PageID #:1886\nprovided for the boys in violation of Title IX.  Plaintiffs argue that the girls’ locker rooms are \ninferior to the boys’ locker rooms for two reasons: (1) the girls have to share a locker room with \na biological boy while the boys do not have to share a locker room with a biological girl; and (2) \nthe alternate private single-use facilities for girls to use if they do not want to use the common \nlocker room are inferior to the boys’ locker room.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, [ECF No. 23, at 18-\n19]. \n  Plaintiffs do not dispute that the physical facilities provided for the boys’ and girls’ \nrestrooms and locker rooms are comparable.  Plaintiffs’ argument is based on the fact the Locker \nRoom Agreement allegedly creates inferior facilities for girls because of who is permitted to use \nthe girls’ locker rooms, i.e., the girls have to share a locker room with a transgender student and \nthe boys do not.  However, even though Plaintiffs allege the boys do not have to share a locker \nroom with a transgender student, District 211 has represented it will provide similar access for a \ntransgender boy wanting to use the boys’ locker room with the same privacy accommodations.  \nSee District 211’s Response Brief, [ECF No. 78, at 22 n.9]. \n  When Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Student A was the only \ntransgender student who had asked District 211 to allow her to use locker rooms consistent with \nher gender identity.  At oral argument on Plaintiffs’ Motion, Intervenor-Defendants’ counsel \nstated that Student C, a transgender boy, recently began his freshman year at a District 211 high \nschool.  Based on District 211’s representation that it would provide similar access to the boys’ \nlocker rooms for transgender boys, the Court is not persuaded Plaintiffs have a likelihood of \nsuccess in establishing that District 211 is violating Title  IX by not providing comparable \nfacilities for all students.  District 211’s Response Brief, [ECF No. 78, at 22 n.9]. \n73 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 74 of 82 PageID #:1887\n  The  Court  also  is  not  persuaded  that  the  alternate  single-use  facilities  District  211 \nprovides for students who do not want to use common restrooms or locker rooms have to be \ncomparable to the common facilities.  Plaintiffs do not cite any case to support that proposition.  \nDistrict 211 provides comparable locker room facilities for boys and girls, and the fact that \nDistrict 211 provides alternate single-use facilities that offer greater privacy options for students \nwho  want  additional  privacy  does  not  change  the  fact  that  the  District  offers  comparable \ncommon facilities for all students.  As far as the Court can tell on this record, the boys’ and girls’ \nlocker rooms at Fremd High School are comparable in all respects.  Student Plaintiffs who \nchoose  to  use  the  alternate  single-use  facilities  with  additional  privacy  protections  cannot \ncomplain that the alternate facilities are not “comparable” to the main facilities offered to boys \nand girls, which they have chosen not to use.  There is no allegation that the alternative facilities \nmade available for boys and girls are not comparable. \n  Accordingly, for all of these reasons, the Court finds Plaintiffs do not have a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their claims that District 211 is violating Title IX. \nB.    Irreparable Harm  \n \n  To satisfy the second threshold requirement for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must \nshow there is a likelihood—more than a mere possibility—they will suffer irreparable harm.  \nWinter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Michigan v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, 667 F.3d 765, 788 (7th Cir. 2011).  Harm “is ‘irreparable’ where it ‘cannot be \nprevented or fully rectified by the final judgment after trial.’”  Girl Scouts, 549 F.3d at 1089 \n(quoting Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 386 (7th Cir. 1984)).  Phrased \nanother way, harm is irreparable when it is “difficult—if not impossible—to reverse.”  Michigan, \n667 F.3d at 788.   \n74 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 75 of 82 PageID #:1888\n  Plaintiffs devote scant space—just three short paragraphs out of 50-plus pages of briefing \nin support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction—to irreparable harm.  Plaintiffs raise two \nundeveloped  arguments.    They  contend  that  irreparable  harm  is  presumed  when  a  party \nestablishes a likely constitutional violation.  Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief, [EFC No. 94], at 24.  And \nthey  assert that Student Plaintiffs are being  forced to endure  a “per  se hostile educational \nenvironment.”  Id.  Both of these arguments rely on the premise that Plaintiffs’ underlying \nconstitutional and Title IX claims have merit.  As already explained, however, Plaintiffs have not \nshown they are likely to prevail on either their constitutional claim or their Title IX claims.  \n  Plaintiffs also assert in a conclusory and generalized manner that Girl Plaintiffs are \nsuffering  from  an  impaired  “access  to  educational  opportunities,  benefits,  programs,  and \nactivities.”  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶ 13].  “[L]ack of access to classes and related programs, \nservices, and activities can constitute irreparable injury for purposes of a preliminary injunction.”  \nP.P. v. Compton Unified Sch. Dist., 135 F. Supp. 3d 1126, 1148 (C.D. Cal. 2015).  Even when \naccess is denied, though, movants may be required to show more to establish irreparable harm.  \nSellers v. Univ. of Rio Grande, 838 F. Supp. 2d 677, 687 (S.D. Ohio 2012) (noting that there is \n“some authority for the proposition that an interruption in an educational program is not, of \nitself, an irreparable injury” and also “contrary case law” that finds irreparable harm “especially \nwhen the denial of an educational opportunity is coupled with other types of harm”). \n  As discussed above, Plaintiffs do not allege that Girls Plaintiffs have stopped going to \nphysical education class, quit an extracurricular activity, received lower grades, or struggled to \nfocus during class.  Instead, the only effect on Girl Plaintiffs’ educational opportunities that \nPlaintiffs identify is the risk of running late to class if they use more remote restrooms and locker \nrooms in the school to avoid using a restroom or locker room with a transgender student.    \n75 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 76 of 82 PageID #:1889\nComplaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 12(e), 236]. There is no indication that anything has negatively \nimpacted Girl Plaintiffs’ education.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not shown this speculative harm is \nirreparable.   \n  Student Plaintiffs’ main irreparable harm argument boils down to their contention that \nthey are suffering “embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, \nand loss of dignity,” which the Court will refer to as “emotional distress” for short, when they \nuse restrooms in the presence of a transgender student or locker rooms in the presence of Student \nA who they label a biological boy.  Id. at ¶ 11 123, 124, 220, 226, 237.  Sometimes, emotional \nharm can be serious enough to rise to the level of irreparable harm.  Moore v. Consol. Edison Co. \nof New York, 409 F.3d 506, 511 (2d Cir. 2005); Kennedy v. Sec’y of Army, 191 F.3d 460, 460 n.5 \n(9th Cir. 1999); Caspar v. Snyder, 77 F. Supp. 3d 616, 640 (E.D. Mich. 2015); Norsworthy v. \nBeard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1164, 1192 (N.D. Cal. 2015), appeal dismissed and remanded, 802 F.3d \n1090 (9th Cir. 2015).  But “emotional suffering is commonly compensated by monetary awards” \nin our legal system.  Bhd. of Locomotive Engineers & Trainmen v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 2011 \nWL 221823, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 24, 2011); see also The Great Tennessee Pizza Co. Inc. v. \nBellsouth  Commc’ns,  2010  WL  3806145,  at  *2  (E.D.  Tenn.  Sept.  23,  2010).    It  is  the \n“extraordinary circumstance[]” when emotional harm, standing alone, is so severe that money \ndamages cannot rectify the harm after a final judgment.  Lore v. City of Syracuse, 2001 WL \n263051, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2001); see also Colorado Wild Horse v. Jewell, 130 F. Supp. 3d \n205, 220 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Therefore, Plaintiffs’ observation or contemplation of the stress and \nsmall risk of physical harm that the horses might suffer while being gathered—sincere as it \nmight be—does not rise to the level of a cognizable, irreparable injury.”). \n76 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 77 of 82 PageID #:1890\n  In this case, Plaintiffs’ allegations of emotional distress do not show Student Plaintiffs are \nsuffering from distress that is so severe it is incapable of being rectified by money damages after \na final judgment.  Plaintiffs’ general and conclusory claims to the contrary are insufficient to \ncarry their burden.  See Lane v. Buckley, --- Fed. App’x. --- , 2016 WL 1055840, at *3 (10th Cir. \nMar. 17, 2016) (“‘As a general rule, . . . a district court should be wary of issuing an injunction \nbased solely upon allegations and conclusory affidavits submitted by plaintiff.’”) (quoting Atari \nGames Corp. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc., 897 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1990)); Gatsinaris v. ART \nCorp. Sols., Inc., 2015 WL 3453454, at *8 (C.D. Cal. May 29, 2015); McDavid Knee Guard, Inc. \nv. Nike USA, Inc., 683 F. Supp. 2d 740, 749 (N.D. Ill. 2010).  In addition, Plaintiffs’ conclusory \nallegations of discomfort and distress, unsupported by the “who, what, where, when, why, and \nhow” of what Student Plaintiffs are experiencing, are too speculative to justify injunctive relief.  \nSee Winkler v. Eli Lilly & Co., 101 F.3d 1196, 1204 (7th Cir. 1996) (recognizing that it is an \nabuse of discretion to grant an junction “based on nothing but speculation and conjecture”); see \nalso Moore, 409 F.3d at 511 (“We affirm the district court’s conclusion[] . . . that the claim of \npsychological harm was too speculative to warrant preliminary relief.”); Holcomb v. California \nBd. of Psychology, 2015 WL 7430625, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 23, 2015) (“Plaintiff likewise \nprovides no factual support showing she is likely to suffer irreparable reputational or emotional \nharm.”); Aune v. Ludeman, 2009 WL 1586739, at *5 (D. Minn. June 3, 2009) (“Plaintiff argues \nthat  excessive  stress  ‘may’  induce  or  aggravate  physical  illness  and  mental  or  emotional \ndisturbance, without a showing of any real threat of irreparable harm to himself.”).   \n  The fact that District 211 provides significant privacy protections and alternate facilities \nfor  students  who,  like  Student  Plaintiffs,  are  uncomfortable  at  the  risk  of  encountering  a \ntransgender  student  in  a  state  of  undress  also  undermines  Plaintiffs’  ability  to  establish \n77 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 78 of 82 PageID #:1891\nirreparable injury.  In the context of a request for preliminary injunctive relief, the movants’ \nfailure to investigate potentially mitigating alternatives undermines any claim of irreparable \nharm.  Orth v. Wisconsin State Employees Union Council 24, 2007 WL 1029220, at *2 (E.D. \nWis. Mar. 29, 2007).  Further, harm is not irreparable if the moving parties fail to take advantage \nof readily available alternatives and thereby effectively inflict the harm on themselves.  Stuller, \nInc. v. Steak N Shake Enterprises, Inc., 695 F.3d 676, 679 (7th Cir. 2012); see also Contech \nCasting,  LLC  v.  ZF  Steering  Sys.,  LLC,  931  F.  Supp.  2d  809,  818  (E.D.  Mich.  2013) \n(“‘[I]rreparable harm will not be found where alternatives already available to the plaintiff make \nan injunction unnecessary.’”) (quoting Curtis 1000, Inc. v. Youngblade, 878 F. Supp. 1224, 1248 \n(N.D. Iowa 1995)). \n  Plaintiffs contend Student Plaintiffs are not using the privacy stalls because they are \ninadequate.  Plaintiffs assert the stalls do not guarantee that Student Plaintiffs will not see or be \nseen by a transgender student in a state of undress.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 162-168, 228-\n230].  Plaintiffs also point out that even if Student Plaintiffs use the stalls, they still will be \nsharing an intimate environment with a student who they perceive to be of the opposite sex.  Id. \nat ¶¶ 155-161, 227, 259-261.   None of these assertions is accurate with respect to the single-use \nalternatives that are available to both female and male students.  Moreover, even if Plaintiffs \nwere correct, that would not change the fact that the privacy stalls substantially reduce the risk \nStudent Plaintiffs will see or be seen by a transgender student in a state of undress in the \nrestrooms or locker rooms.   \n  In addition, there is no evidence that the risk of being late to class and extracurricular \nactivities,  id.  at  ¶¶  250-251,  254-257,  will  have  a  meaningful  negative  impact  on  Student \nPlaintiffs’ education.  Moreover, the mere inconvenience of walking to a facility that is farther \n78 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 79 of 82 PageID #:1892\naway does not constitute irreparable harm.  See Mclean v. Aurora Loan Servicing, 2011 WL \n4635027, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2011); Corbett v. United States, 2011 WL 1226074, at *5 (S.D. \nFla. Mar. 2, 2011) (both stating that mere inconveniences are not irreparable harms).         \n  Plaintiffs further contend all of the privacy protections and alternatives available to them \nto mitigate the risk of exposure to or by a transgender student are inadequate because of pressure \nfrom District 211 and other students.  Plaintiffs assert the District has “conveyed to the Student \nPlaintiffs the message that any objection to the Locker Room Agreement (or the Restroom \nPolicy) will be viewed by the District administration as intolerance and bigotry.”  Complaint, \n[ECF No. 1, at ¶ 148]; see also id. at ¶¶ 149-154.  There also are very general allegations District \n211 has conveyed  the  message that “differing views will not be tolerated.”  Id. at ¶ 153.  \nPlaintiffs say this message has deterred Student Plaintiffs from requesting privacy options.  Id.  \nEven assuming this is true, the discomfort Plaintiffs (both parents and students) feel at the \nDistrict’s perceived disapproval of their position does not constitute irreparable injury.   \n  As discussed above, Girl Plaintiffs also say students who take advantage of the privacy \noptions in the main physical education locker room are “ridicule[d]” by their classmates.  Id. at ¶ \n140; see also id. at ¶¶ 141-146.  Plaintiffs allege that, in the locker room and in the hallways, \nmale and female students called one Girl Plaintiff names, yelled derogatory slang words for \nfemale body parts at her, and accused her of being transphobic and homophobic.  Id. at ¶ 145.  \nThere is no justification for that kind of conduct by other students.  But the pain and pressure \nthese other students have brought upon a Girl Plaintiff is not necessarily the District’s fault, and \nthere is no allegation that District 211 was aware of any such conduct and willfully ignored or \ndisregarded it.  And, again, Plaintiffs stymied District 211’s attempt to discover the specifics \nunderlying these allegations, including whether the District was informed of this misconduct.  \n79 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 80 of 82 PageID #:1893\nAlso, importantly, there is no indication in the record that any student was bullied or risks being \nbullied if she were to use a single-use facility to change clothes or shower.   \n  Finally, the Restroom Policy, in particular, is neither causing nor likely to cause Plaintiffs \nirreparable harm.  District 211 implemented the Restroom Policy during August 2013.  See id. at \n¶¶ 211, 214-217; Federal Defendants’ Response Brief, [ECF No. 80, at 13].  Plaintiffs did not \nfile this lawsuit until May 2016, almost three years later.  Either Student Plaintiffs did not notice \nthat transgender students were using restrooms consistent with their gender identity, or they \nknew about the Restroom Policy and tolerated it for years.  Further, Plaintiffs acknowledge they \nwere aware of the Restroom Policy at least as of October 2015 when it was announced publicly \nby District 211, and they waited almost seven months after that before filing this lawsuit.   \n  Under these circumstances, it is likely that the impetus for this lawsuit was the Locker \nRoom Agreement signed in December 2015, not the Restroom Policy standing alone.  For all of \nthese reasons, Plaintiffs’ delay in challenging the Restroom Policy strongly indicates that the \nRestroom Policy is not causing them irreparable harm.  See Tap Pharm. Products, Inc. v. Atrix \nLabs., Inc., 2004 WL 2034073, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 26, 2004) (recognizing that an unjustified \ndelay in seeking relief “can be fatal to claims of irreparable harm”); see also Traffic Tech, Inc. v. \nKreiter, 2015 WL 9259544, at *22 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 18, 2015); Ixmation, Inc. v. Switch Bulb Co., \nInc., 2014 WL 5420273, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2014); Celebration Int’l, Inc. v. Chosun Int’l, \nInc., 234 F. Supp. 2d 905, 920 (S.D. Ind. 2002). \n  Accordingly,  the  Court  finds  Plaintiffs  have  not  shown  they  are  likely  to  suffer \nirreparable harm that cannot be rectified after a final judgment, even if they prevail on the merits \nof their claims. \n80 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 81 of 82 PageID #:1894\nC.    Adequate Remedy At Law \n \n  To satisfy the third and final threshold showing, Plaintiffs must show they do not have an \nadequate remedy at law.  Girl Scouts, 549 F.3d at 1095.  In other words, Plaintiffs must show \nmoney damages would be inadequate compensation for the harm they have suffered if they win \nthis  lawsuit.    Id.    Plaintiffs  need  not  show  traditional  legal  remedies  would  be  “wholly \nineffectual,”  but,  rather,  that  they  would  be  “seriously  deficient  as  compared  to  the  harm \nsuffered.”  Foodcomm Int’l v. Barry, 328 F.3d 300, 304 (7th Cir. 2003).  “[S]howing irreparable \nharm is ‘[p]robably the most common method of demonstrating that there is no adequate legal \nremedy.’”  Campbell v. Miller, 373 F.3d 834, 840 (7th Cir. 2004) (Williams, J., dissenting) \n(quoting 11A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 2944 (2d ed. 1995)); see also Fleet Wholesale Supply Co. v. Remington Arms Co., \n846 F.2d 1095, 1098 (7th Cir. 1988); Wil-Kar, Inc. v. Vill. of Germantown, 153 F. Supp. 2d 982, \n987 (E.D. Wis. 2001).  \n  Plaintiffs do not address or even touch on this threshold requirement for the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction.  As previously stated, “emotional suffering is commonly compensated by \nmonetary awards” in our legal system.  Bhd. of Locomotive Engineers & Trainmen, 2011 WL \n221823, at *5; see also The Great Tennessee Pizza Co., 2010 WL 3806145, at *2.  In this case, \nPlaintiffs seek nominal and compensatory money damages as a remedy.  Complaint, [ECF No. 1, \nPrayer for Relief, at ¶ E].  They have not shown why these damages would be a seriously \ndeficient or inadequate remedy.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to show they \nlack an adequate remedy at law. \n81 \n\nCase: 1:16-cv-04945 Document #: 134 Filed: 10/18/16 Page 82 of 82 PageID #:1895\nD.    The  Court  Need  Not  Engage  In  A  Balancing  Analysis  In  Light  Of  Its \nRecommendation Concerning The First Three Threshold Showings For Preliminary \nInjunctive Relief \nWhen the parties seeking a preliminary injunction have not made “any one of” the three \nthreshold showings—likelihood of success on the merits, likelihood of irreparable harm, and \ninadequate remedy at law—the court “must deny the injunction.”  Girl Scouts, 549 F.3d at 1086. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs have not made any of the required three showings with respect to either the \nFederal Defendants or District 211.  Because of these failures, the Court need not address the \nbalancing phase of the preliminary injunction analysis.  See id. (explaining that only after the \ncourt finds that the movants have “passed this initial threshold” does the court “then proceed[] to \nthe balancing phase”); see also Ctr. For Individual Freedom v. Madigan, 735 F. Supp. 2d 994, \n1000 (N.D. Ill. 2010) (“Plaintiff has failed to establish some likelihood of succeeding on the \nmerits.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to also consider the balance of harms.”). \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor  all  of  the  reasons  discussed  in  this  Report  and  Recommendation,  the  Court \nrespectfully recommends that Judge Alonso deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n[ECF No. 21].  Written objections to this Report and Recommendation may be served and filed \nwithin 14 days from the date of this Report and Recommendation.  FED. R. CIV. P. 72(b).  Failure \nto file objections with the district court within the specified time will result in a waiver of the \nright  to  appeal  all  findings,  factual  and  legal,  made  in  this  Report  and  Recommendation. \nTumminaro v. Astrue, 671 F.3d 629, 633 (7th Cir. 2011).   \n____________________________________ \nJeffrey T. Gilbert \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \nDated: October 18, 2016 \n82 ",
