      "text": "\n############# New Text on 20240829 ###############\nIN  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF COOK COUNTY,  ILLINOIS \nCOUNTY DEPARTMENT,  CHANCERY DIVISION \nNOVA  MADAY!, \n \nPlaintiff,  e\nCase No. \nVv.  e\ne\nTOWNSHIP HIGH  SCHOOL DISTRICT \n211, \n \nDefendant.  e\ne\nN\nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE AND  OTHER RELIEF \nNova Maday (“Nova”),  by her attorneys  John Knight  and  Ghirlandi  Guidetti  of the Roger \nBaldwin  Foundation  of ACLU,  Inc.,  and  Jeffrey  H.  Bergman  of Mandell  Menkes  LLC,  for  her \ncomplaint  against  Township  High  School  District  211  (“District  211”  or  “the  District”),  states  as \nfollows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Nova  is  a  female  high  school  senior  who  is  suing  District  21 1,  the  school  district \nthat runs her school,  Palatine High  School,  for violating the Illinois Human Rights Act by treating \nher differently from other girls  solely because  she is transgender. \n2.  The  District has  denied Nova use of the girls’  locker room  to  change into  required \nclothing  for  participation  in  physical  education  (“P.E.”)  class  while  permitting  ali  otherznon- \ntransgender girls  to use the  locker room to  change.  a  =  i. \n:  N ; \n  G\nLE A\nM\n \n  S\nB G\nM\nO\n   \nee Wd\ni\nz\n:\n \n4\nG\n  \n3.  More recently,  the  District  told Nova that  it would allow her to  use the  girls’  locker \nroom,  but  only  if  she  agreed  to  dress  in  an  unspecified  private  changing  area  within  the  locker \nroom,  even  though  the  District  does  not  require  other  girls  to  do  so. \n4.  Nova  would  like  to  participate  in  P.E.  as  other  students  are  required  to  do. \n5.  Like students  at many other high  schools across the country,  students attending P.E. \nclasses  at  Palatine  High  School  change  into  gym  shorts  and  t-shirts  without  fully  undressing  or \nshowering. \n6.  Students  at  Palatine  High  School  changing  for  P.E.  generally  do  not  completely \nundress  for class  and  take  measures  to  preserve  their privacy  while  changing. \n7.  Like many other  students,  Nova is  modest  about her body  and would  takes  steps  to \navoid  other  students  seeing her body in  the  locker  room. \n8.  Like  other  students,  Nova  values  privacy  and  would  use  the  locker  room  to \ndiscretely  change  her  own  clothes  and  not  observe  anyone  else’s  changing  habits  or  bodies. \n9.  Under the  District’s  policy,  however,  Nova  must  be  conspicuously  separated  from \nher  fellow  students  and  singled  out  for differential  treatment by being required  to  dress  separately \nfrom  them,  either  in  a  separate  facility  or in  a  separate  area within  the  locker room.  The  District’s \nactions  signal  to Nova that  she is  not really a  girl  and  should  feel  ashamed  of who  she  is  and  about \nher  body,  in  particular.  Her  treatment  by  the  District  challenges  Nova’s  identity  and  personhood, \nundermines  her  self-confidence,  and  revokes  her  membership  from her peer  group. \n10.  In  order  to  take  P-E.,  the  District  would  separate  Nova  from  her  peers  and  single \nher out by requiring her to  change in  a separate area.  As  a result,  for both her Junior and her Senior \nyears up  until  the  date  of this  complaint,  she has  accepted  a  waiver from  participating in  P.E.\n11.  District  211’s  discriminatory  treatment  of Nova  constitutes  illegal  discrimination \non  the  basis  of  gender  identity  under  the  Human  Rights  Act.  School  administrators  across  the \ncountry  recognize  that  it  is  harmful  to  transgender  students  to  single  them  out  by  treating  them \ndifferently  than  their  peers  and  that  frequently  raised  hypothetical  concerns  and  fears,  including \nprivacy  concerns,  about  allowing  transgender  students  to  use  locker  rooms  and  restrooms  are \n“wholly  unfounded  in  practice.”  Brief of Amici  Curiae  School  Administrators  from  Thirty-One \nStates  and  the  District  of Columbia  at  3,  11-16,  Gloucester  County  School  Board  v.  G.G.,  2017 \nWL  930055  (U.S.  2017).  In  contrast,  schoo]  districts  with  policies  that  allow  students  to  use  the \nlocker  rooms  that  match  the  student’s  gender  identity  “enhance[]  the  educational  experience  for \nall  students.” Jd.  at  3. \n12.  | Among other relief, Nova asks the Court to  enter a cease and desist order that would \nallow her to  use the girls’  locker room to  change  for  P.E.  on  the  same  terms  as  other girls  and  take \nP.E.  before her last  semester of school  begins  on  January  9,  2018. \nJURISDICTION \n13.  Nova  celebrated  her  eighteenth  birthday,  and  became  a  legal  adult,  on  September \n23,  2017.  On  September 8,  2016,  Nova  was  still  a minor,  so her mother filed charge number 2017- \nCP-0498  on  her  behalf  against  District  211  with  the  Illinois  Department  of  Human  Rights \n(“IDHR”).  The  charge alleged that District 211  unlawfully discriminated  against Nova in violation \nof the  Illinois  Human Rights Act,  775  ILCS  5/1-101,  et seg.  (the  “Act”)  by denying her use  of the \ngirls’  locker room  because  she  is  transgender. \n14.  On  or  about  September  6,  2017,  IDHR  mailed  its  Notice  of Dismissal  for  Lack  of \nSubstantial  Evidence  (the  “Notice  of Dismissal”)  to  counsel  for the  parties.  Because  IDHR mailed \nthe  Notice  of Dismissal  to  the  wrong  address  for  Nova  and  her  mother’s  lawyers,  Nova  did  not\nreceive  it  until  October  11,  2017.  This  complaint  is  filed  within  ninety  (90)  days  of receipt  of the \nNotice  of Dismissal  and  is  therefore  timely under  775  ILCS  5/7A-102(D)(3). \n15.  Venue  is  proper in this  Court because the  civil  rights violations  complained of took \nplace  in  Cook  County.  775  ILCS  5/8-111(A)(). \nTHE  PARTIES \n16.  — The  District  is  a  school  district  located  in  Cook  County  that  operates  several  high \nschools,  including Palatine  High  School.  Nova has  attended  Palatine  High  School  since  she  began \nthe  ninth  grade  in  the  fall  of 2014  and  is  currently  in  the  twelfth  grade  for  the  2017-2018  school \nyear. \n17.  Palatine  High  School  is  an  Illinois  public  school  located  in  Palatine,  Illinois. \nPalatine  High  School  serves  students  in  grades  nine  through  twelve. \n18.  Palatine  High  School  is  a  “place  of public  accommodation”  under the  Act,  since  it \nis  a high  school.  775  ILCS  5/5-101(A)(11). \nFACTS \nA.  Nova  is  Female  and  Transgender \n19.  Nova  is  a  young  woman. \n20.  Nova  is  transgender,  since  her  female  gender  identity  does  not  match  her \ndesignation  as  male  at  birth.  While  hospital  staff identified  her  as  male  at  birth,  she  has  known \nsince  she was  young that  she  is  female.  Nova  lives  and  presents  herself as  female  in  all  aspects  of \nher life. \n21.  Nova  is  not  any less  female  than her  female peers  because  she  is  transgender. \n22.  Everyone  has  a  gender  identity,  which  is  an  established  medical  concept  referring \nto  a  person’s  deeply  felt,  inherent  sense  of being  a  particular  gender  (e.g.,  a  girl  or  female).  Most\npeople have  a gender identity that matches  their gender-assigned  at birth,  but transgender people’s \ngender  identity  fails  to  match  the  gender they were  assigned  when  born. \n23.  Nova  first  told  her  family  she  was  a  girl  on  March  29,  2014,  before  her  freshman \nyear at Palatine High  School.  She did so, because  she had been experiencing  extreme distress  from \ngender  dysphoria,  a  serious  and  internationally-recognized  medical  condition  experienced  by \nmany  transgender persons  in  which  the  mismatch  between  a  person’s  gender  identity  and  gender \nassigned  at  birth  causes  them  persistent  and  clinically  significant  distress.  In  March  or  April  of \n2014,  Nova  sought medical  treatment  and  was  diagnosed  with  gender dysphoria.  She has  received \ntreatment  for  the  condition  since  then. \n24.  Gender  dysphoria  is  recognized  by  the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s \nDiagnostic  &  Statistical  Manual  of Mental  Disorder  (Sth  ed.  2013). \n25.  Being  transgender,  however,  “implies  no  impairment  in  judgment,  stability, \nreliability,  or  general  social  or vocational  capabilities.” Am.  Psychiatric  Ass’n, Position  Statement \non  Discrimination  Against  Transgender  &  Gender  Variant  Individuals  (2012),  at \nhttps://goo.gl/iXBMOS. \n26.  With  appropriate  treatment,  individuals  with  gender  dysphoria  can be  cured  of the \ncondition  and  experience  no  clinical  symptoms. \n27.  Around  the  same  time  that  Nova  was  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria,  she  began \ngrowing  out her hair and  dressing  and  grooming  consistent with  the  styles  of other girls  her  age  at \nher  school.  Since  September of 2014,  Nova has  presented  fully  and  exclusively as  a  girl  outside of \nschool  by  also  using a  traditionally feminine name,  the  female pronouns  “she/her/hers,”  and  using \nfemale restrooms  in  public places.  In  October 2016,  Nova  started  hormone  therapy.\n28.  |  The  medical  and  scientific  community  has  reached  a  consensus  that  the  treatment \nof  gender  dysphoria  is  for  girls  who  are  transgender  to  live  as  girls,  and  for  boys  who  are \ntransgender to  live  as  boys.  For  certain  transgender persons,  treatment may  also  include  hormone \ntherapy  and  surgery.  Every  major  medical  and  mental  health  organization  in  the  United  States \nsupports  this  consensus  regarding treatment,  including the  American  Medical  Association  and the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics. \n29.  Transgender  persons’  ability  to  live  consistent  with  their  gender  identity  is  critical \nto  their  health  and  well-being.  This  includes  the  ability  to  use  names  and  pronouns  that  are \ncongruent with their gender identity,  groom  and dress  according to  norms typically associated with \ntheir gender,  and  the use  of restrooms  and  locker rooms  that match  their  gender identity.  Denying \npersons,  including  students,  the  ability  to  live  according  to  their  gender  identity  puts  them  at \nserious  risk  of depression  and  even  suicide;  while  persons  who  are  transgender  who  are  able  to \nlive  consistently  with  their  core  identity  are  able  to  lead  successful  lives  in  all  respects,  including \nthe  ability to  excel  at  school  and  work. \nB.  Nova’s  Experience  at  District 211  and  Denial  of Girls’  Locker  Room  Usage \n30.  Nova has presented  fully as  a  girl  at  school  since  October 2014.  At  school,  she uses \na female name and  dresses  and grooms  in  a  style consistent  with the way other girls  at  school  dress \nand  groom.  Also,  Nova’s  teachers  and  peers  have  referred  to  her  by  her  female  name  and  female \npronouns  since  October  2014. \n31.  Nova  uses  the  girls’  restrooms  at  school  without  incident.  She  delayed  using  the \ngirls’  restrooms  until  May  2016,  however,  because  of her  concern  that  the  District’s  requirement \nthat  she  dress  for gym  separately  from  all  the  other  girls  would  encourage  one  or more  of them  to \nchallenge Nova’s use  of the  girls’  restrooms.\n32.  In May 2015,  Nova  met  with  a school  counselor to discuss her transition  within  the \nschool  environment  and  whether  she  could  use  the  girls’  locker  room.  The  counselor  told  Nova \nshe  could  not  use  the  girls’  locker room,  which  the  Director  of Student  Services  confirmed. \n33.  In  June  2015,  Nova’s  mother  spoke  with  the  school  counselor  about  Nova’s \ntransition  and  about  her  locker  room  usage  for  P.E.  in  the  fall  of 2015.  The  counselor  offered  to \nallow  Nova to  use  the  private  restroom  in  the  nurse’s  office  to  change  for  P.E.  class.  Nova  agreed \nto dress  separately from the other girls, because the District had  excluded her from the  girls’  locker \nToom. \n34.  Soon  thereafter,  Nova’s  mother  requested  that  the  District  list  Nova’s  gender  as \nfemale  and  reflect  her  female  name  in  her  school  records.  The  District  at  first  said  that  it  was \nunable  to  make  those  changes,  but  then  informed  Nova  on  October  1,  2015  that  it  would  do  so? \nAt  that  time,  the  District  also  issued  Nova  an  updated  student  identification  card  reflecting  her \nfemale name  and  gender. \n35.  During the beginning of her sophomore year in fall  2015, Nova began to experience \nanxiety,  depression,  and  worsening  of her  gender  dysphoria  related  to  the  requirement  that  she \ndress  separately  from  all  the  other  girls  for  her  P.E.  class.  As  a  result,  her  P.E.  grade  rapidly \ndeclined. \n36.  | From  November  2015  until  June  2016,  Nova’s  mother  emailed,  spoke  by  phone, \nand  met  with  District  211  administration  and  Nova’s  P.E.  teacher  several  times  regarding  Nova’s \nperformance  and  grade  in  P.E.  and  the  harmful  emotional  impact  her  experience  dressing  for  P.E. \nwas  having on  her.  In  addition,  Nova  and  her mother repeatedly renewed  their request  for Nova to \nbe  able to  use  the  girls’  locker room. \n*  District records indicate that it  did not  actually make the change unti]  November  18,  2015.\n37.  On  November  3,  2015,  for  example,  Nova’s  mother  emailed  the  school  counselor \nand Director  of Student  Services  about  a  notice  she had  received  from  the District  discussing the \nfederal  Department  of  Education  (“ED”)  investigation  of the  District  for  discriminating  against \nanother  transgender  student  (“Student  A”)  who  attended  another  high  school  operated  by  the \nDistrict.  In  the  notice,  the  District  referred  to  private  changing  stations  in  locker  rooms  and  stated \nthat  transgender  students  may  use  the  locker  room  that  matches  their  gender  identity  if they  use \n“individual  measures  of privacy.”  Nova’s  mother  asked  if Nova  would  now be  allowed  to  use  the \ngirls’  locker  room.  The  Director  responded  that  it  was  not  possible  to  install  privacy  areas  at \nPalatine  High  School  so  Nova  would  not be  able to  use  the  girls’  locker  room. \n38.  Again on December 3,  2015,  Nova’s mother emailed the District to  ask whether the \nDecember  2,  2015  ED  settlement  regarding  Student  A  would  mean  that  Nova  would  finally  be \nallowed  to  use  the  girls’  locker  room.  The  Director  of Student  Services  told  Nova’s  mother  that \nthe  settlement  only  applied to  Student  A  and would not  extend  to  any other  student  in  the District. \n39.  | Nova’s mother called the Director of Student Services on January 3,  2016 regarding \nNova’s  ongoing problems  with  P.E.  The District  still  refused to  allow Nova to  use  the  girls’  locker \nroom,  but  instead  offered  an  alternate  private  locker  room  that  would  remain  locked  until  Nova \nrequested  that  school  staff let  her  in  to  dress  for  P.E.  class  and  to  let  her  in  again  after  class  to \nchange  out  of her  gym  clothing, \n40.  Nova began using the  separate  locker room  on  February  1,  2016,  and  soon  ran  into \ndifficulties.  On February 2,  she  found that  the locker containing her belongings had  been replaced. \nNova  went  to  the  school  office  to  ask  the  Director  of Student  Services  what  had  happened  to  her \ngym  clothes.  After talking  with  several  other District  staff members,  Nova  learned  that  her locker \nhad  been replaced by other  lockers,  but  no  one  was  sure  where the  old  lockers  had  been  moved.\n41.  Nova and District  staff spent several minutes trying to locate the locker, which they \nfinally  found  on the  school’s  loading  dock.  Nova retrieved  her  clothes  and  changed.  However,  by \nthe  time  Nova  made  it  to  P.E.  class,  the  period  was  halfway  over.  Even  though  Nova  was  late \nbecause  of  the  District’s  actions  in  moving  her  locker,  the  P.E.  teacher  told  her  she  would  be \nrequired  to  complete  the  full  set  of  class  exercises  in  the  remaining  class  time,  which  she  was \nunable  to  do. \n42.  On February 3, 2016,  the day after her locker was placed  on the loading dock, Nova \nwent  back  to  using  the  restroom  in the  nurse’s  office  to  change  for  P.E.  However,  from  February \nthrough May 2016, Nova’s PE. teacher changed the location of class approximately once per week \nand posted  a notice inside the  girls’  locker room  informing the  other girls of the  change.  Nova was \nnot  allowed  to  enter  the  girls’  locker  room  and  the  P.E.  teacher  did  not  tell  her  where  P.E.  class \nwould  be  held,  so  Nova  frequently  had  to  wander  around  the  school  to  find  out  where  her  P.E. \nclass  was  being held,  causing her to  miss  a  significant  amount  of class  time. \n43.  Isolating  and  singling  out  Nova  from  the  other  girls  by  forcing  her  to  dress \nseparately  for  P.E.  and  requiring her  to  at  times  wander  the  halls  looking  for  where her  class  was \nbeing  held  were  extremely  upsetting  experiences  for  Nova.  These  experiences  worsened  her \nanxiety level  and  further  impacted her P.E.  grade. \n44,  After  Nova’s  mother  contacted  the  Director  of  Student  Services  about  the  P.E. \nteacher’s  failure  to  advise  Nova  of the  location  of her  P.E.  class,  the  Director  had  a  notice  board \ninstalled  outside  of the  girls’  locker  room  where  the  P.E.  teacher  could  post  notice  of the  location \nfor P.E.  each day.  However,  the P.E.  teacher rarely posted  such  a notice,  so Nova continued to  face \nthe embarrassment and missed  class  time from having to  search out where her P.E.  class was being \nheld. \n \n45.  On  May  12,  2016,  Nova’s  mother  emailed  Nova’s  P.E.  teacher  to  explain  Nova’s \ndifficulty  with  class  and  tried  to  work  on a  solution  to  make  it  possible  for Nova  to  complete  the \nclass  with  a passing  grade. \n46.  | Nova’s  mother  also  emailed  the  Director  of  Student  Services  on  May  13,  2016, \nregarding  the  guidance  from  the  federal  Departments  of  Education  and  Justice  regarding  the \napplication  of Title IX to  transgender students  (“Title  [x guidance”).  She  wanted to  know whether \nthis  guidance  would  mean  that  Nova  would  finally  be  able  to  use  the  girls’  locker  room.  The \nDirector  followed  up  by phone  and  said the District would  not be following the  guidance. \n47.  The  following  day,  May  14,  2016,  Nova  met  with  the Director of Student  Services \nto  once  again  request  use  of the  girls’  locker  room.  She  informed  him  that  she  could  not  use  the \nnurse’s  office  anymore  because  of the  extreme  anxiety using  it  caused  her. \n48.  From  early  May 2016  until  the  end  of the  school  year  in  June,  Nova’s  P.E.  teacher \ngrew  increasingly hostile  towards Nova,  exacerbating Nova’s  anxiety.  The teacher repeatedly told \nNova  that  she  would  fail  P.E.  unless  she  did  make-up  sessions,  and  minimized Nova’s  experience \nof discrimination.  The  P.E.  teacher’s  comments  further upset Nova,  making it even more difficult \nfor her to participate in P.E.  class. \n49.  On May  19, 2016, Nova’s mother called the Director of Student Services to express \nher  disappointment  in  the  P.E.  teacher’s  treatment  of Nova,  and  asked  that  he  talk  with  the  P.E. \nteacher.  The  Director  of  Student  Services  assured  Nova’s  mother  that  Nova  would  not  have  to \nrepeat  P.E.,  and  that he  would  talk  with  the teacher  about the  situation. \n50.  The  next  day,  on  May  20,  2016,  the  P.E.  teacher  confronted  Nova  about  her  grade \nagain,  and  said  she would need to  attend make-up  sessions  in order to pass the  class.  Nova told her \nwhat  the  Director  had  said  the  day  before:  that  she  would  be  able  to  pass  P.E.  so  long  as  she \n10\nparticipated  in  class.  The  P.E.  teacher  said  she  had  not  heard  from  the  Director  but  would  follow \nup with him. \nSi.  The  P.E.  teacher  also  asked  why Nova  was  having  a  hard  time  participating.  Nova \nexplained  the  anxiety  she  experienced  by  being  separated  from  all  the  other  girls  and  forced  to \ndress separately in the nurse’s office. The teacher minimized the impact Nova’s segregation should \nhave  on  her,  suggested  that  Nova  had  brought  the  problem  on  herself,  and  implied  that  she  could \nsimply  dress  with  the  boys.  The  teacher  then  suggested  that  Nova  could  keep  her  regular  clothes \non  for  P.E.  for  the  rest  of the  school  year,  rather  than  changing  for  gym.  Not  dressing  for  gym, \nNova  explained,  would  only  make  her  stand  out  more  than  she  already  does,  since  all  the  other \ngirls  in  her  class  would  be  in their P.E.  clothes. \n52.  Later  that  day,  Nova  told  her mother  about  her  conversation  with  the  P.E.  teacher. \nNova’s  mother then  emailed  the  Director of Student  Services  to  request  a  meeting. \n53.  On  May  23,  2016,  Nova’s  mother  met  with  the  Director  of  Student  Services,  the \nschool  counselor,  the  P.E.  teacher,  and  the  Chair  of  the  P.E.  Department  to  discuss  Nova’s \ntreatment  by  the  P.E.  teacher,  and  again  requested  that  Nova  be  allowed  to  use  the  girls’  locker \nroom.  This  time,  the Director told  her that  he had  no  authority to  grant Nova permission to use the \ngirls’  locker room. \n54.  | Nova’s  mother  emailed  the  District  administration  on  June  17,  2016,  to  again \nrequest  that  Nova  be  allowed  to  use  the  girls’  locker  room  for  the  upcoming  2016-2017  school \nyear. \n55.  Counsel  for the District  and  for Nova spoke by phone on June  17,  2016  about Nova \nbeing  able  to  use  the  girls’  locker  room.  Nova’s  counsel  advised  the  District’s  lawyer  that  Nova \n \nal \n  \nwanted  to  be  able  to  use  the  girls’  locker  rooms,  but  if the  District  intended  to  refuse  that  request \nshe would  accept  a  gym waiver  as  an  alternative. \n56.  On  July  1,  2016,  the  District  Superintendent  emailed  Nova’s  mother  regarding \nNova’s  need  to  use  the  girls’  locker  room.  Rather  than  affirming  Nova’s  right  to  use  the  girls’ \nlocker  room,  the  Superintendent  said  the  District  would  discuss  the  possibility  of  a  waiver  of \nNova’s  requirement  to participate  in  P.E. \n57.  On  August  11,  2016  District  staff met  with  Nova  and  her mother  and  offered Nova \na waiver  from  P.E,  class,  rather than  allowing her to  use the  girls’  locker room, \n58.  Close  to  a  year later,  Nova  and  her mother met with  District  staff on July 24,  2017. \nDuring  that  meeting,  the  District  for  the  first  time  offered  Nova  use  of the  girls’  locker  room,  but \nonly if Nova agreed to dress in  an unspecified privacy area.  Nova and her mother refused  that offer \nbecause the District does not require non-transgender girls to  dress in  a privacy area.  Instead, Nova \nand  her mother  accepted  another  waiver  from  the  P.E.  requirement. \n59.  The  District  has  denied  Nova  the  use  of the  girls’  locker  room  for  her  sophomore \n(2015-2016),  junior  (2016-2017),  and  senior  years  (2017),  up  until  the  filing  of this  complaint. \nUnder  Illinois  law,  all  students  in  grades  Kindergarten  through  12  must  take  a  P.E.  class,  unless \ngranted  a  waiver.  Nova  wants  to  participate  in  P.E.  class,  like  other  students.  However,  because \nthe  District  has  refused  to  let  her  use  the  girls’  locker room,  Nova  has  agreed  up  to  now  to  accept \na P.E.  waiver. \n60.  District  211s  position  that  Nova  should  be  required  to  change  in  a  separate  area \nwithin  the  locker  room  because  she  is  transgender  is  different  from  the  locker  room  policies  and \npractices  used  by  numerous  other  schools.  Numerous  schools  in  Mlinois  and  nationally  treat \ntransgender  students  the  same  as  non-transgender  students  with  respect  to  locker room  usage. \n  \n  \n12 \n \n61.  Based  on her  conversations  with  other girls,  Nova  believes  that  as  a general  matter \nthe  other  girls  at  her high  school  do  not  fully disrobe  when  changing  in  the  locker rooms  for  P.E. \nand  take  steps  to  minimize  the  chance  that  other  girls  will  see  their  bodies.  Nova  would  do  the \nsame. \n62.  On  information  and  belief,  no  non-transgender student  at  District  211  was  required \nto  use  a  separate  facility  to  dress  for  P.E.  class  from  the  common  locker  room  used  by  the  other \nstudents  of the  same  gender  or  forced  to  use  a  separate  changing  area  within  the  locker room. \n63.  Nova’s  ability to  live as a  girl  in  all  aspects  of her life has been  essential  for treating \nher  gender  dysphoria.  Before  treatment,  Nova  had  severe  depression.  Since  her  treatment  began, \nNova’s  depression  has  improved,  her grades  have  gotten  better  in  all  her  classes  besides  P.E.,  and \nshe  has  become  more  social.  On  the  other  hand,  being  excluded  from  the  girls’  locker  room  at \nPalatine  High  School  by  District  211  or  forced  to  change  in  a  separate  area  has  been  extremely \nupsetting  for  Nova,  and  causes  her  great  anxiety.  It  makes  her  feel  like  an  outcast  and  something \nless  than  a real  person;  it  is  simply humiliating  for her. \nCIVIL  RIGHTS  VIOLATIONS  UNDER THE \nILLINOIS  HUMAN  RIGHTS  ACT \nCount  I:  District 211  Denied Nova  the  Full  and  Equal  Access  of Its  Facilities  Because \nof Nova’s  Gender-Related  identity. \n64.  Nova  hereby  incorporates  by  reference  and  re-alleges  Paragraphs  1  through  63,  as \nthough  fully  set  forth herein. \n65.  The  Act  is  intended  to  prevent  and  eliminate  discriminatory practices  in  places  of \npublic  accommodation  because  of an  individual’s  gender-related  identity.  775  ILCS  5/1-102(A). \nThe  Act  prohibits  discrimination  on the  basis  of “sexual  orientation,”  which  is  defined  to  include \n“actual  or  perceived...gender-related  identity,  whether  or  not  traditionally  associated  with  the \nperson's  designated  sex  at  birth.”  775  ILCS  5/1-103(O-1). \n13\n66.  It  is  a  civil  rights  violation  under  the  Act  “for  any  person  on  the  basis  of unlawful \ndiscrimination to...[d]eny or refuse to  another the  full  and  equal  enjoyment of the facilities,  goods, \nand  services  of any  public  place of accommodation.”  775  ILCS  5/5-102(A). \n67.  Respondent refused,  withheld  from,  and  denied  Nova the  full  and  equal  enjoyment \nof its  facilities,  namely  the  girls’  locker  rooms,  based on her  gender-related  identity. \n68.  Asa  result  of  Respondent’s  violation  of  the  Act,  Nova  has  suffered  substantial \nmental  and  emotional  distress,  as  well  as  the  stigmatizing  injury  and  deprivation  of  personal \ndignity that  accompanies  the  denial  of equal  access  to  a place  of public  accommodation. \nWHEREFORE  Plaintiff respectfully requests  the  following relief: \nA.  The  entry of an  order directing District  211  to  cease  and  desist  from  discriminating \non  the  basis  of gender-related  identity by  refusing  transgender  students,  including \nbut not limited to Nova, to use the locker rooms  consistent with their gender identity  i \nand on the  same terms  as  other  students  (i-e.,  without  restrictions); \nB.  The  entry  of  an  order  directing  District  211  to  cease  and  desist  from  all  other  : \nviolations  of the Act; \nCc.  Actual  damages,  including  damages  for  emotional  distress,  for  the  injury  and  loss \nsuffered by Nova; \nD.  Interest  on  Nova’s  actual  damages; \nE.  An  order  mandating  that  District  211  pay  Nova’s  and  her  mother’s  reasonable \nattomeys’  fees  and  costs  pursuant  to  775  ILCS  5/8A-104(G);  and \nF,  Any  additional  relief that the  Court  deems just  and  appropriate. \n  \n14\n  \n  \n   \nDATED:  November  30,  2017  Respectfully  Submitted, \nNOVA \nJohn  Knight,  Attorney No.  45404 \nGhirlandi  Guidetti,  Attorney No.  62067 \nRoger Baldwin Foundation  of ACLU,  Inc. \n150 N.

Bergman of Mandell Menkes LLC, and Neil \nLloyd,  Meredith  R.W.  DeCarlo,  and  Carly  E.  Weiss  of  Schiff  Hardin  LLP,  for  her  First \nAmended  Complaint  against  Township  High  School  District  211  (“District  211”  or  “the \nDistrict”) states as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Nova  is  a  young  woman  who  attended  Palatine  High  School,  which  is \nadministered by District 211. Nova graduated in 2018. She is suing District 211 for damages for \nviolating the Illinois Human Rights Act by treating her differently from other girls solely because \nshe is transgender.  \n2.  During the 2017-2018 school year, pursuant to its policy regarding transgender \nstudents’ use of locker room facilities, the District denied Nova full and equal enjoyment of the \ngirls’ locker room by placing limits on her use of the locker room to change into required \nclothing  for  participation  in  physical  education  (“P.E.”)  class  that  were  not  put  on  non-\ntransgender students. Specifically, the District told Nova that it would only allow her to use the \n\ngirls’ locker room if she dressed in a separate changing area, or “privacy stall,” within the locker \nroom, even though the District did not require other non-transgender girls to do so.  \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nh 3.  Because Nova objected to being treated differently from other girls because she is \nc\n7\n1\n0\n2\nM    transgender, and feared being stigmatized because she was not allowed to use the locker room in \nA\n1 \n5\n1: the same manner as the other students, she obtained a waiver at the District’s suggestion from the \n1\n9 \n1\n0\n2/2 required P.E. class. However, had she been allowed to use the locker room in the same manner \n1\n3/\nTE:  as other girls, she would not have sought a waiver, and would have participated in P.E. class. \nA\nD\nD \nE 4.  The District’s policy would have conspicuously separated Nova from her fellow \nL\nFI\nstudents, and singled her out for differential treatment, by requiring her to dress separately from \nthem in a separate area within the locker room. The District’s actions signaled to Nova that she \nwas not really a girl, and that she should feel ashamed of who she is and ashamed about her \nbody. Her treatment by the District challenged Nova’s identity and personhood, undermined her \nself-confidence, and revoked her membership from her peer group.  \n5.  School  administrators  across  the  country  recognize  that  it  is  harmful  to \ntransgender students to single them out by treating them differently than their peers, and that \nfrequently raised hypothetical concerns and fears, including privacy concerns, about allowing \ntransgender students to use locker rooms and restrooms are “wholly unfounded in practice.” \nBrief  of  Amici  Curiae  School  Administrators  from  Thirty-One  States  and  the  District  of \nColumbia at 3, 11-16, Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., 2017 WL 930055 (U.S. 2017). \nIn contrast, school districts with policies that allow students to use the locker rooms that match \nthe student’s gender identity “enhance[] the educational experience for all students.” Id. at 3. \n2 \n\n6.  District 211’s discriminatory treatment of Nova constituted illegal discrimination \non the basis of gender identity under the Human Rights Act. Nova seeks to recover damages and \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nh attorneys’ fees for this violation of her rights. \nc\n7\n1\n0\n2\nM    7.  In addition to the illegal discrimination described herein that took place during \nA\n1 \n5\n1: Nova’s senior year (the 2017-2018 school year), the District illegally discriminated against Nova \n1\n9 \n1\n0\n2/2 by denying her the full and equal enjoyment of the girls’ locker room at Palatine High School for \n1\n3/\nTE:  periods prior to her senior year. However, in this First Amended Complaint Nova only seeks to \nA\nD\nD \nE recover damages and attorneys’ fees for the violation of her rights that took place during her \nL\nFI\nsenior year. During that academic year, the District required Nova to change in an area within the \ngirls’ locker room separate from all the other girls if she wanted to use the locker room to change \nfor P.E. class, a requirement that the District did not impose on non-transgender girls. \nJURISDICTION \n8.  Nova celebrated her eighteenth birthday, and became a legal adult, on September \n23, 2017. On September 8, 2016, while Nova was still a minor, her mother filed charge number \n2017-CP-0498 on her behalf against District 211 with the Illinois Department of Human Rights \n(“IDHR”).  The  charge  alleged  that  District  211  unlawfully  discriminated  against  Nova  in \nviolation of the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101, et seq. (the “Act”) by denying her \nuse of the girls’ locker room because she is transgender. \n9.  On or about September 6, 2017, IDHR mailed its Notice of Dismissal for Lack of \nSubstantial Evidence (the “Notice of Dismissal”) to counsel for the parties. Because IDHR \nmailed the Notice of Dismissal to the wrong address for Nova and her mother’s lawyers, Nova \ndid not receive it until October 11, 2017. Nova’s initial complaint in this matter was filed within \n3 \n\nninety (90) days of receipt of the Notice of Dismissal and was therefore timely under 775 ILCS \n5/7A-102(D)(3).  \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nh 10.  Venue is proper in this Court because the civil rights violations complained of \nc\n7\n1\n0\n2\nM    took place in Cook County. 775 ILCS 5/8-111(A)(1). \nA\n1 \n5\n1: THE PARTIES  \n1\n9 \n1\n0 11.  The District is a school district located in Cook County that operates several high \n2\n2/\n1\n3/\nE:  schools, including Palatine High School. Nova attended Palatine High School from the time she \nT\nA\nD\nD  began the ninth grade in the fall of 2014 until she graduated in May of 2018. \nE\nL\nFI\n12.   Palatine High School is an Illinois public school located in Palatine, Illinois. \nPalatine High School serves students in grades nine through twelve. \n13.  Palatine High School is a “place of public accommodation” under the Act, since it \nis a high school. 775 ILCS 5/5-101(A)(11). \nFACTS \nA.  Nova is Female and Transgender \n \n14.  Nova is a young woman.  \n15.  Nova  is  transgender,  since  her  female  gender  identity  does  not  match  her \ndesignation as male at birth. While hospital staff identified her as male at birth, she has known \nsince she was young that she is female. Nova lives and presents herself as female in all aspects of \nher life.  \n16.  Nova is not any less female than her female peers because she is transgender.  \n17.  Everyone has a gender identity, which is an established medical concept referring \nto a person’s deeply felt, inherent sense of being a particular gender (e.g., a girl or female). Most \npeople have a gender identity that matches their gender-assigned at birth, but a transgender \nperson’s gender identity does not match the gender they were assigned when born.  \n4 \n\n18.  Nova first told her family she is a girl on March 29, 2014, before her freshman \nyear at Palatine High School. She did so because she had been experiencing extreme distress \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nh from gender dysphoria, a serious and internationally-recognized medical condition experienced \nc\n7\n1\n0\n2\nM    by many transgender persons in which the mismatch between a person’s gender identity and \nA\n1 \n5\n1: gender assigned at birth causes them persistent and clinically significant distress. In March or \n1\n9 \n1\n0\n2/2 April of 2014, Nova sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. She \n1\n3/\nTE:  has received treatment for the condition since then.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 19.  Gender  dysphoria  is  recognized  by  the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s \nL\nFI\nDiagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (5th ed. 2013).  \n20.  Being  transgender,  however,  “implies  no  impairment  in  judgment,  stability, \nreliability,  or  general  social  or  vocational  capabilities.”  Am.  Psychiatric  Ass’n,  Position \nStatement on Discrimination Against Transgender  & Gender Variant Individuals  (2012), at \nhttps://goo.gl/iXBM0S. \n21.  With appropriate treatment, individuals with gender dysphoria can be cured of the \ncondition and experience no clinical symptoms. \n22.  Around the same time that Nova was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, she began \ngrowing out her hair, and dressing and grooming consistent with the styles of other girls her age \nat her school. In September of 2014, Nova began presenting fully and exclusively as a girl \noutside  of  school  by  also  using  a  traditionally  feminine  name,  the  female  pronouns \n“she/her/hers,” and using female restrooms in public places. In October 2016, Nova started \nhormone therapy. \n23.  The medical and scientific community has reached a consensus that the treatment \nof gender dysphoria is for girls who are transgender to live as girls, and for boys who are \n5 \n\ntransgender to live as boys. For certain transgender persons, treatment may also include hormone \ntherapy and surgery. Every major medical and mental health organization in the United States \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nh supports this consensus regarding treatment, including the American Medical Association and \nc\n7\n1\n0\n2\nM    the American Academy of Pediatrics.  \nA\n1 \n5\n1: 24.  Transgender persons’ ability to live consistent with their gender identity is critical \n1\n9 \n1\n0\n2/2 to their health and well-being. This includes the ability to use names and pronouns that are \n1\n3/\nTE:  congruent with their gender identity, groom and dress according to norms typically associated \nA\nD\nD \nE with their gender, and the use of restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. \nL\nFI\nDenying persons, including students, the ability to live according to their gender identity puts \nthem at serious risk of depression and even suicide; while persons who are transgender who are \nable to live consistently with their core identity are able to lead successful lives in all respects, \nincluding the ability to excel at school and work. \nB.  Nova’s Experience at District 211 and the District’s Denial of Her Use of the \nGirls’ Locker Room. \n \n25.  Nova presented fully as a girl at school beginning in October 2014. At school, she \nused a female name and dressed and groomed in a style consistent with the way other girls at \nschool dressed and groomed. She also used the girls’ restrooms at school with incident from May \n2016 until she graduated. Nova’s teachers and peers referred to her by her female name and \nfemale pronouns since October 2014.  \n26.  Beginning in the spring of her freshman year of high school, Nova and her mother \nmade repeated requests of relevant officials at the District that the District allow her to use the \ngirls’ locker room to change her clothes for P.E. class, as non-transgender girls did. Each time up \nuntil she met with the District in July 2017, the District refused to let Nova use the girl’s locker \nroom at all.  \n6 \n\n27.  Before Nova’s senior year of high school on July 24, 2017, Nova and her mother \nmet with District staff again to request that she be allowed to use the girl’s locker room. During \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nh that meeting, the District for the first time offered Nova use of the girls’ locker room, but only if \nc\n7\n1\n0\n2\nM    Nova agreed to dress in what the District referred to as a “privacy area,” which was an enclosed \nA\n1 \n5\n1: stall within the girls’ locker room. Nova and her mother refused that offer because the District \n1\n9 \n1\n0\n2/2 did not require non-transgender girls to dress in such a stall, separated from the other girls. \n1\n3/\nTE:  Instead, at the District’s suggestion Nova and her mother accepted a waiver from the P.E. \nA\nD\nD \nE requirement  \nL\nFI\n28.  The District denied Nova the full and equal enjoyment of the girls’ locker room \nfor  her  senior  year  of  high  school  (2017-2018).  Under  Illinois  law,  all  students  in  grades \nKindergarten through 12 must  take a P.E. class, unless granted a waiver. Nova wanted to \nparticipate in P.E. class, like other students. However, because the District refused to let her use \nthe girls’ locker room, Nova agreed to accept a P.E. waiver. \n29.  The policy that District 211 adopted in the 2017-2018 school year that would \nhave required Nova to change in a separate area within the girls’ locker room because she is \ntransgender is different from the locker room policies and practices used by numerous other \nschools. Numerous schools in Illinois and nationally treat transgender students the same as non-\ntransgender students with respect to locker room usage.  \n30.  Nova’s ability to live as a girl in all aspects of her life has been essential for \ntreating her gender dysphoria. Before treatment, Nova had severe depression. Once her treatment \nbegan, Nova’s depression improved, her high school grades improved in all her classes besides \nP.E., and she became more social. On the other hand, being excluded from the girls’ locker room \nat Palatine High School by District 211 or forced to change in a separate area was extremely \n7 \n\nupsetting for Nova, and caused her great anxiety. It made her feel like an outcast and something \nless than a real person; it was simply humiliating for her. \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nch CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS UNDER THE \n7\n01 ILLINOIS HUMAN RIGHTS ACT \n2\nM   \nA Count I:   District 211 Denied Nova the Full and Equal Access of Its Facilities Because \n1 \n5 of Nova’s Gender-Related identity. \n1:\n1\n9 \n01 31.  Nova hereby incorporates by reference and re-alleges Paragraphs 1 through 30, as \n2\n2/\n1\n3/\nE:  though fully set forth herein. \nT\nA\nD\nD  32.  The Act is intended to prevent and eliminate discriminatory practices in places of \nE\nL\nFI\npublic accommodation because of an individual’s gender-related identity. 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A). \nThe Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of “sexual orientation,” which is defined to include \n“actual or perceived…gender-related identity, whether or not traditionally associated with the \nperson's designated sex at birth.” 775 ILCS 5/1-103(O-1). \n33.  It is a civil rights violation under the Act “for any person on the basis of unlawful \ndiscrimination to…[d]eny or refuse to another the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities, \ngoods, and services of any public place of accommodation.” 775 ILCS 5/5-102(A). \n34.  By requiring Nova to change her clothes within a separate enclosed area within \nthe girls locker room during the 2017-2018 school year, instead of allowing her to change \noutside of such an area as other girls were allowed to do, the District refused, withheld from, and \ndenied Nova the full and equal enjoyment of its facilities, namely the girls’ locker room at \nPalatine High School, based on her gender-related identity.  \n35.  As a result of Respondent’s violation of the Act, Nova suffered substantial mental \nand emotional distress, as well as the stigmatizing injury and deprivation of personal dignity that \naccompanies the denial of equal access to a place of public accommodation. \nWHEREFORE Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief: \n8 \n\nA.  Actual damages, including damages for emotional distress, for the injury and loss \nsuffered by Nova; \n1\n9\n7\n5\n1\nh B.  Interest on Nova’s actual damages; \nc\n7\n1\n0\n2\nM    C.  An order mandating that District 211 pay Nova’s and her mother’s reasonable \nA\n1 \n5\n1: attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 775 ILCS 5/8A-104(G); and \n1\n9 \n1\n0\n2/2 D.  Any additional relief that the Court deems just and appropriate.  \n1\n3/\nTE:  DATED: March 12, 2019        Respectfully Submitted, \nA\nD\nD \nE               NOVA MADAY  \nL\nFI\n                         \n              By: Jeffrey H.

The  trial  court  denied  Nova’s  request  for  a \npreliminary injunction, concluding that the Act permits the school to treat Nova differently \non the basis of her transgender identity.  This appeal of right followed.  No questions are \nraised on the pleadings. \nISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW \n1.  Does the Illinois Human Rights Act permit a school to treat students \ndifferently in their use of school locker room facilities because they are transgender? \n2.  Did the circuit court err in denying Nova Maday a preliminary injunction, \nwhen her pleadings and the evidence of record show that she has a clear, ascertainable, \nprotectable right; would be irreparably harmed by the denial of injunctive relief; has no \ninadequate remedy at law, is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim; and the balance \nof harms favors injunctive relief?   \nJURISDICTION \nSupreme Court Rule 307(a)(1) permits an appeal “from an interlocutory order of \ncourt:  granting, modifying, refusing, dissolving, or refusing to dissolve or modify an \ninjunction.”1  On January 25, 2018, the circuit court denied Nova’s preliminary injunction \nrequest. A. 3.  Nova timely appealed on February 7, 2018. \n                                                 \n1 The circuit court has jurisdiction over Nova’s lawsuit.  The Act provides that when the \nIllinois Department of Human Rights (“IDHR”) dismisses a charge for lack of substantial \nevidence (as it did here), the complainant may file a civil action in the appropriate circuit \ncourt. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(3). \n  -1-   \n \n\n \nSTATUTES INVOLVED \nThis appeal involves the interpretation of the following provisions of the Illinois \nHuman Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.: \nSec. 1-103. General Definitions. When used in this Act, unless the \ncontext requires otherwise, the term: \n* * *  \n(O) Sex. “Sex” means the status of being male or female.  \n(O-1) Sexual orientation. “Sexual orientation” means actual or perceived \nheterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, or gender-related identity, \nwhether or not traditionally associated with the person’s designated sex at \nbirth. “Sexual orientation” does not include a physical or sexual attraction \nto a minor by an adult. \n* * *   \n(Q) Unlawful Discrimination. “Unlawful discrimination” means \ndiscrimination against a person because of his or her race, color, religion, \nnational origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, order of protection \nstatus, disability, military status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or \nunfavorable discharge from military service as those terms are defined in \nthis Section. 2 \nSec. 5-101. Definitions. The following definitions are applicable strictly \nin the context of this Article:  \n(A) Place of Public Accommodation. “Place of public accommodation” \nincludes, but is not limited to:  \n* * *  \n(11) a non-sectarian nursery, day care center, elementary, secondary, \nundergraduate, or postgraduate school, or other place of education; \n \n                                                 \n2 Although sexual orientation and gender identity are included within the definition of \nSection 1-103(O-1), the Act makes clear that sexual orientation and gender identity are \ndifferent.  \n  -2-   \n \n\n \nSec. 5-102. Civil Rights Violations: Public Accommodations. It is a civil \nrights violation for any person on the basis of unlawful discrimination to:  \n(A) Enjoyment of Facilities, Goods, and Services. Deny or refuse to \nanother the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities, goods, and services \nof any public place of accommodation;  \nSec. 5-102.2. Jurisdiction limited. In regard to places of public \naccommodation defined in paragraph (11) of Section 5-101, the \njurisdiction of the Department is limited to: (1) the failure to enroll an \nindividual; (2) the denial of access to facilities, goods, or services; or (3) \nsevere or pervasive harassment of an individual when the covered entity \nfails to take corrective action to stop the severe or pervasive harassment. \n(Emphases added.) \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nNova Is a Student at District 211 Who is Transgender \nFor purposes of the preliminary injunction motion, the following central facts \nwere undisputed:  (1) Nova is a girl who is also transgender; (2) she is currently a student \nat Palatine High School, part of defendant Township High School District 211 (the \n“District”); and (3) the District has denied, and continues to deny, Nova full and equal \nuse of the girls’ locker room because she is transgender. \nNova is transgender because she has known since a very young age that she is \nactually female even though she was assigned the male gender when she was born.  A. 65; \nA. 70.  Every human being has a deeply internalized view of their gender identity, a sense \nof oneself as belonging to a particular gender.  A. 76.  The term gender identity is a well-\nestablished concept in medicine, and the medical community has determined that gender \nidentity is firmly established early in life.  Id.  A person’s gender identity, however, is not \ndirectly linked to, nor does it have a causal relationship with, the gender a person is \nclassified as when they are born.  Id.  Moreover, a person’s innate sense of their gender \nidentity may not always conform to their birth-assigned gender.  Id.  For transgender \n  -3-   \n \n\n \nindividuals, the sense of one’s self — one’s gender identity — differs from their birth-\nassigned gender, giving rise to a sense of being “wrongly embodied.” Id. \n  Nova has been formally diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the medical term used \nto describe this sense of being “wrongly embodied” and the resulting clinically significant \ndistress experienced by some people whose innate sense of their gender differs from the \ngender they were assigned at birth.  A. 77–78; A. 82.  This condition predisposes Nova to \nincreased depression and anxiety when societal expectations that she conform to her birth-\nassigned gender defy her innate comprehension that she is actually female.  A. 77.   \n  Many transgender people experience this condition, particularly during those (often \nadolescent) years when the process of externally presenting as their inherent gender \n(instead of the one assigned at birth) begins.  A. 79.  For example, before she presented as \nfemale, Nova avoided mirrors and photographs that reminded her of her assigned male \ngender, and she increasingly isolated herself in her room, away from family and friends \nwhose perception of her as male further increased her depression.  A. 65. \nThe District Has Treated Nova Unequally Because She Is Transgender. \n  Nova is prohibited from using the girls’ locker room like other girls at Palatine High \nSchool.  The only reason is that she is transgender.  In May 2015, at the end of her freshman \nyear of high school, Nova approached the school’s administration to request that she be \nallowed to use the girls’ locker room to change for P.E. class.  A. 66–67.  A month later, \nNova’s mother followed up with the District.  A. 71.  The District refused.  A. 67; A. 71.  \nAnd it continues to refuse.  A. 66–67; A. 71.   \n  Instead of treating Nova like all other Palatine High School girls, the District \ninitially proposed that she change in a restroom in the school nurse’s office.  A. 65–66; A. \n71.  Several months later, before her sophomore year began, the District told Nova that she \n  -4-   \n \n\n \ncould use a single-user locker room. A. 66.  But this room was always locked, requiring \nNova to find a staff member to let her in to change before and after P.E. class, often causing \nher to be late.  A. 66.  This was embarrassing; it exacerbated her gender dysphoria, \nincreased her anxiety, and hurt her P.E. class grade.  A. 66.   \n  Nova and her mother continued to request permission for Nova to use the locker \nroom.  On July 24, 2017, following these requests, the District told Nova that she could use \nthe girls’ locker room during her senior year, provided that she “agreed to change her \nclothes in changing stalls within the locker room.”  Def.’s Resp., C. 251–52; see also A. \n66; A. 71.  Girls who are not transgender are not required to use the changing stalls.  \nInstead, those girls can use those stalls if they want, but they have the option of changing \nin the open section of the locker room.  The District told Nova that she must always use a \nstall separating her from the other girls or she would be barred from the girls’ locker room.  \nA. 66–67; A. 71.  Rather than accept a policy that treated her differently solely because she \nis transgender, Nova accepted a waiver from P.E. for the 2017–2018 school year. A. 67; \nA. 71–72. \nThe District’s Discriminatory Policy Has Caused Nova Significant Harm \n  The District’s decision to prevent Nova from using the girls’ locker room has \ncaused Nova to experience increased anxiety, depression, and increased gender dysphoria \nstress, facts that the District has neither challenged, nor has a basis to dispute.  A. 66–67.  \nSpecifically, by enforcing a policy that requires Nova to use the locker room facilities in a \nmanner different from her female classmates, the District has declared that Nova is not a \n“real” girl.  A. 67.  Nova has been made to feel as though she is an outcast who should be \nashamed of her identity.  Id.  Drawing this distinction between Nova and the other female \n  -5-   \n \n\n \nhigh  school  students  has  exacerbated  Nova’s  gender  dysphoria  —  the  District  has \nreinforced the division between Nova’s assigned birth gender and her true identity, forcing \nher to constantly confront that incongruence and the significant distress that accompanies \nthat realization.  A. 67; A. 77–78.   \n  Medical experts have determined that gender dysphoria elicits a “grief of being \nborn into the wrong body.”  A. 79.  Nova has stated, and the District has not denied, that \nits policy has unnecessarily worsened that sense of grief and despair.  A. 66–67.  All Nova \nwants is to be treated the same as the other girls in her school.  A. 67.  Instead, the District \nhas disrupted Nova’s transition to living consistent with her gender identity, which the \nmedical community has found to be in conflict with “evidence-based medical practice and \ndetrimental to the health and well-being of the individual[.]”  A. 80.   \nOther Female High School Students Have the Option to Use Private Changing Areas \n  Intervenor Students and Parents for Privacy (SPP) filed its own federal lawsuit \nagainst the District in federal court in Chicago.3  SPP claimed that the presence of a \ntransgender student in the locker room violated their privacy.  The federal court disagreed:  \n“the students had not established any constitutional right to privacy” that would allow them \nto prevent a transgender student from using the same locker room.  Def.’s Resp., C. 252.  \nInstead, any student who does not want to share the locker room with someone who is \ntransgender may ask the District to use a separate private changing area.  The school \nprovides separate changing areas in the communal locker room (the changing stalls), in a \nsingle-user locker room, and in a gender neutral bathroom in the nurse’s office.  Def.’s \n                                                 \n3 Students and Parents for Privacy v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 1:16-cv-04945, 2017 WL \n6629520 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 29, 2017). \n  -6-   \n \n\n \nResp., Sec. C. 22–23.  Just as every student has the option of requesting (by their own \nchoice) to use a separate facility to change for any number of personal reasons, a female \nstudent who objects to Nova’s right to use the locker room would be able to use the separate \nfacilities available at the high school.  Def.’s Resp., Sec. C. 21–23. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  On September 3, 2016 (when Nova was beginning her junior year), Nova’s mother \nfiled, on Nova’s behalf, a Charge of Discrimination (the “Charge”) with the Illinois \nDepartment of Human Rights (IDHR) alleging that the District was discriminating against \nNova on the basis of her gender identity in violation of the Act.  A. 86–89.  Just over a year \nlater (on September 6, 2017), the IDHR mailed (to the wrong address) a Notice of \nDismissal for Lack of Substantial Evidence (the “Notice”).  Nova’s counsel received the \nNotice on October 11, 2017.  Nova sued the District on November 30, 2017 under 775 \nILCS 5/7A-102(D)(3).  Compl., C. 14.   \n  On December 13, 2017, Nova sought a preliminary injunction to bar the District \nfrom discriminating against her solely on the basis of her transgender identity.  A. 47–104.  \nAfter briefing and argument, the trial court denied the motion.4  In an oral ruling issued on \nJanuary 25, 2018, the trial court held that Section 5-102.2 of the Act permits the District to \ntreat Nova differently solely because she is transgender.  A. 3–46.   \n                                                 \n4 In the course of briefing on her preliminary injunction request, the trial court granted \nleave for SPP to intervene in the case on an emergency basis.  It did so without affording \nNova an opportunity to oppose intervention in writing, but instead provided her the \nopportunity to file a motion to reconsider the grant of intervention.  Nova has done so and \nSPP’s status is pending before the trial court.  Notably, in its ruling denying Nova’s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction, the trial court did not rely on any of SPP’s arguments.  As \nnoted above, SPP has separately sued the District in the Northern District of Illinois \nconcerning its policies toward students who are transgender. \n  -7-   \n \n\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Act Does not Permit the District’s Discriminatory Policy.  \nThis is a straightforward case of unlawful discrimination.  There is no disputed \nissue of fact.  Indeed, the District concedes that the only reason it treated Nova differently \n— requiring of her what it did not require of other girls — is because she is transgender.  \nThat is classic discrimination, the very thing the General Assembly has prohibited.  To be \nsure, the District believes that the Act permits it to discriminate and the trial court agreed.  \nBut the only question on review is a legal one.  Nova will succeed on her claim if the Act \nforbids the District’s unwritten discriminatory policy. \nUnder the facts and circumstances of this case, the standard of review of the trial \ncourt’s order is accordingly de novo.  First, a trial court’s exercise of its equitable authority \nis ordinarily subject to review for abuse of discretion.  Roxana Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. No. 1 \nv. WRB Ref., LP, 2012 IL App (4th) 120331, ¶ 27, (“We review a trial court’s decision \ngranting or denying a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion, which occurs only \nwhen its ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, or when no reasonable person would \nadopt the court’s view.”) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  Second, an error of \nlaw is an abuse of discretion.  A&R Janitorial v. Pepper Constr. Co., 2017 IL App (1st) \n170385, ¶ 16 (“‘If a trial court’s decision rests on an error of law, then it is clear that an \nabuse of discretion has occurred, as it is always an abuse of discretion to base a decision \non an incorrect view of the law,’” quoting North Spaulding Condo. Ass’n v. Cavanaugh, \n2017 IL App (1st) 160870, ¶ 46).  Third, review of legal questions, including issues of \nstatutory construction, is de novo.  Bank of New York Mellon v. Laskowski, 2018 IL 121995, \n¶ 12 (“The construction of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo.”). \n  -8-   \n \n\n \nHere, the trial court made no factual findings, but instead denied Nova’s request for \na preliminary injunction on a purely legal ground:  it concluded that the Act permits school \ndistricts to treat transgender people differently solely on the basis of their transgender \nstatus.  Review is accordingly de novo.  See Makindu v. Illinois High Sch. Ass’n, 2015 IL \nApp (2d) 141201, ¶ 32 (“[W]here the trial court does not make any factual findings and \nrules on a question of law, the appellate court’s review is de novo”); Doe v. Ill. Dep’t of \nProf’l Regulation, 341 Ill. App. 3d 1053, 1060 (1st Dist. 2003) (“The court’s ruling \nconstruing the statute will be reviewed de novo”); People ex rel. White v. Travnick, 346 Ill. \nApp. 3d 1053, 1060, (2d Dist. 2004) (“to the extent that the trial court’s ruling was based \non its construction of a statute, a reviewing court may resolve the issue as a matter of law \nusing a de novo standard of review”) (internal citation omitted); Peregrine Fins. & Sec. v. \nHakakha, 338 Ill. App. 3d 197, 202 (1st Dist. 2003) (de novo standard of review applies \nwhen preliminary injunction is issued “in the absence of any findings as to factual issues,” \n“the relevant underlying facts are not in dispute,” and the trial court “ruling was clearly \none of law”). \nA  party  may  obtain  a  preliminary  injunction  when  she  has  “(1)  a  clear, \nascertainable, protectable right; (2) irreparable injury; (3) inadequate remedy at law; and \n(4) likelihood of success on the merits.”  Stanton v. City of Chicago, 177 Ill. App. 3d 519, \n522 (1st Dist. 1988); see also In re Estate of Wilson, 373 Ill. App. 3d 1066, 1075 (1st Dist. \n2007).  “[A] party seeking injunctive relief need only raise a ‘fair question’ as to the \nexistence of the right claimed.”  George S. May Int’l Co. v. Int’l Profit Assocs., 256 Ill. \nApp. 3d 779, 786–87 (1st Dist. 1993) (citing Buzz Barton & Assocs. v. Giannone, 108 Ill. \n2d 373, 382 (1985)).  Preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent the continuation \n  -9-   \n \n\n \nof an injurious act until the court can reach the merits.  Kalbfleisch v. Columbia Cmty. Unit \nSch. Dist. No. 4, 396 Ill. App. 3d 1105, 1117–18 (5th Dist. 2009) (upholding injunction \npermitting  service  animal  to  accompany  student;  relief  permissible  to  prevent  the \nprospective harm sought to be avoided); see also Brooks v. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, 11 Ill. App. \n3d 791, 798–99 (1st Dist. 1973); Kolstad v. Rankin, 179 Ill. App. 3d 1022, 1034 (4th Dist. \n1989).  If a plaintiff satisfies the four-part test, the court then considers whether granting \nthe injunction would be in the public interest.  See, e.g., Kalbfleisch, 396 Ill. App. 3d at \n1119–20 (in balancing the hardships between the parties, “the court should also consider \nthe effect of the injunction on the public”). \nThe trial court concluded that Nova had met the second (irreparable harm) and third \n(no adequate remedy) prongs of the four-part test.  A. 27–28 (“I would submit that those \nelements are likely established by the Plaintiff, no adequate remedy at law or irreparable \nharm, based on the briefs, based on the arguments and based on the facts.”).  But it denied \nthe injunction because it concluded that the statute permits the District to discriminate; \nNova accordingly was unlikely to succeed on the merits. \nSpecifically, the trial court held that the Act gives members of a protected class \n(like Nova) a right only to “access,” and not to “full and equal enjoyment,” of her school’s \nfacilities, goods, and services.  A. 27.  Because the District did offer to allow Nova to \nchange for P.E. class within the girls’ locker room, the trial court held that it had given her \n“access.”    A. 28–31 (“But what they have done is they’ve allowed access.  Access, access, \naccess.”).   \nThe trial court declined to address the balance of harms.  A. 31–32 (“The statute \nbrought us here, I’m looking at the statute, that’s the way I interpret the statute, and \n  -10-   \n \n\n \ntherefore I don’t think that there’s a likelihood of success on the merits and I don’t need to \nget to the other balancing issues.”).   \nFor three reasons, the Act does not permit the District to discriminate against Nova.   \nFirst, there is no question that the Act prohibits schools from discriminating on the \nbasis of transgender identity.  Here’s why.  Section 5-102 makes it a civil rights violation \nfor any person to use a discriminatory basis to “[d]eny or refuse to another the full and \nequal  enjoyment  of  the  facilities,  goods,  and  services  of  any  public  place  of \naccommodation.”  Nova’s  school  is  a  place  of  public  accommodation.    Section  5-\n101(A)(11).  Among the prohibited discriminatory bases is gender-related identity.  See \nSection 1-103(Q) (unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation); Section 1-\n103(O-1) (defining sexual orientation to include “actual or perceived . . . gender-related \nidentity, whether or not traditionally associated with the person’s designated sex at birth”).  \nRead in tandem, these provisions prohibit discrimination against someone because their \ngender identity does not match the gender assigned to them at birth.   \nIn Sommerville v. Hobby Lobby Stores, ALS No. 13-0060C (Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n \n2015) (May 15, 2015 Recommended Liability Determination) (adopted in relevant part by \nCommission, Nov. 2, 2016)) (A. 92–104), the Illinois Human Rights Commission held that \nHobby Lobby Stores violated a female employee’s right to be free from discrimination in \nher use of a public accommodation under the Act when it prohibited her use of the women’s \nrestroom used by other female employees and customers because she is transgender.  See \nalso Michael S. and Andrea E. v. Komarek Sch. Dist. 94, ALS No. 16-0003 (Ill. Hum. Rts. \nComm’n 2018) (March 20, 2018 Recommended Liability Determination) (finding that a \nschool policy which denies a student use of the restroom that matches their gender identity \n  -11-   \n \n\n \nbecause they are transgender is a violation of the IHRA) (A. 168–190).  The Illinois Human \nRights  Commission’s  interpretation  of  a  statutory  provision  of  the  Act  is  accorded \nsubstantial weight and deference; “[t]his is so because the Commission’s interpretation of \nthe Act flows directly from its expertise and experience with the statute that it administers \nand enforces.”  Wanless v. Illinois Human Rights Comm’n, 296 Ill. App. 3d 401, 403 (3d \nDist. 1998).  Accordingly, the Act on its face precludes any public accommodation \n(including the District) from denying a person the “full and equal enjoyment of the \nfacilities” (here, the girls’ locker room) because she (like Nova) is transgender. \nSecond, the District has discriminated against Nova because she is transgender.  No \nother girls are required to use a separate stall to change for P.E. class in the girls’ locker \nroom.  Only someone who is transgender faces this requirement.  And they face the \nrequirement  only  because  they  are  transgender.    The  Act  requires  “full  and  equal \nenjoyment” for a reason — there is no such thing in Illinois as “a little” allowable \ndiscrimination.  The General Assembly has made it clear that singling out members of \nidentified protected classes and treating them differently because of their protected status \nis abhorrent and unlawful.  The District does not have — and cannot offer — a legally \ncognizable reason for treating Nova differently from other girls. \nThird, the Act does not carve out a discriminatory zone for schools.  The trial court \ndid not dispute that the District denied Nova full and equal use of the locker room.  See A. \n28 (“Plaintiff, Ms. Maday, and her attorneys argue that it’s not full and equal access, and \nthat may be a correct statement.”).  Nonetheless, the court concluded — without any \nsupport from the Illinois Human Rights Commission or the courts — that the District may \ndeny or refuse “full and equal enjoyment” (775 ILCS 5/5-102), of its facilities, goods, and \n  -12-   \n \n\n \nservices, provided it does not wholly deny “access” (id. at 5/5-102.2).  On the trial court’s \nreading, African-American and Caucasian girls could be required to use one part of the \ngirls’ locker room and Asians and Latinos another, since both would have “access” to the \nlocker room.  Students of different religions could be segregated in the cafeteria.  Race and \nreligion, after all, are also protected statuses under the Act, but a school apparently needn’t \ngive any member of every race or religion “full and equal enjoyment,” just “access.”   \nHow did the trial court reach this result?  By turning a section governing the \nDepartment of Human Rights’ jurisdiction into a substantive authorization for schools to \ndiscriminate.  It is clear that Section 5-102.2 is jurisdictional — it says so.  “[T]he \njurisdiction of the department is limited . . . .”  The legislature created Section 5-102.2 in \n2010 by moving language previously included in Section 5-101.  Compare 2007 Ill. Legis. \nServ. P.A. 95-668 (S.B. 593) (schools are public accommodations “in regard to the failure \nto enroll an individual or the denial of access to its facilities, goods, or services, except that \nthe Department shall not have jurisdiction over charges involving curriculum content, \ncourse content, or course offerings, conduct of the class by the teacher or instructor, or any \nactivity within the classroom or connected with a class activity such as physical education.” \n(emphasis added)) with 2009 Ill. Legis. Serv. P.A. 96-814 (H.B. 2547) (creating Section 5-\n102.2,  and  expanding  jurisdiction  to  include  “severe  or  pervasive  harassment  of  an \nindividual when the covered entity fails to take corrective action to stop the severe or \npervasive harassment.”).   \nThis  history  shows  that  the  legislature’s  intent  was  to  avoid  requiring  the \nDepartment to investigate charges about school curriculum and course content (areas \ntraditionally  entrusted  to  school  discretion).    For  example,  the  Department  cannot \n  -13-   \n \n\n \ninvestigate under the Act whether the content of a particular history, English, or science \ncourse is somehow discriminatory.  But there is not a whisper of a suggestion that the \nlegislature  meant  to  limit  the  Act’s  applicability  when  schools  deny  full  and  equal \nenjoyment of the facilities, goods, and services of schools on the basis of a protected status.  \nHad the legislature intended to redefine or limit what constitutes a “civil rights violation” \nin an educational setting, it clearly knew how to do so.  Indeed, it has done so for activity \nprotected by the First Amendment.  See id. at 5/5-102.1 (“(a) It is not a civil rights violation \n. . . (b) . . . shall not be a civil rights violation.”). \nCourts properly give different statutory language that has “substantially the same” \nmeaning the same effect.  See Maksym v. Bd. of Election Comm’rs of City of Chicago, 242 \nIll. 2d 303, 321–22 (2011) (“residency” in one part of an act and “resided” in another have \nsubstantially the same meaning and should be given the same effect absent a clearly \nexpressed legislative intent to treat them differently); see also Nuzzi v. Bd. of Trustees of \nTeachers’ Ret. Sys. of State, 2015 IL App (4th) 140401, ¶ 36 (the statutory phrases “benefit \nis not payable,” “benefit shall continue until,” and “such annuity shall cease” should all be \ngiven the same effect); People v. Rodriguez, 2014 IL App (2d) 130148, ¶ 81–82 (“at or \ninto” and “in the direction of or into” should be given the same effect).  Because the phrase \n“the denial of access to facilities” in Section 5-102.2 is substantially the same as the phrase \n“deny or refuse the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities” in Section 5-102, the two \nsections should be given the same effect.  Section 5-102.2 gives the Department of Human \nRights jurisdiction over cases involving denials of the use of a school facility or the goods \nor services of such accommodation, while Section 5-102 establishes the conduct by a \npublic accommodation that is a “civil rights violation.”  \n  -14-   \n \n\n \nAccepting the District’s statutory argument would undermine the purposes of the \nIHRA and lead to an absurd result.  A court should avoid interpreting statutory language \nin such a way as to undermine the statute’s overall purpose, Rodriguez, 2014 IL App (2d) \n130148, ¶ 44 (In interpreting statutory language, one factor a court considers is “the \napparent intent of the legislature in enacting it”), and because the IHRA is remedial \nlegislation, it must be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.  Arlington Park Race \nTrack Corp. v. Human Rights Comm’n, 199 Ill. App. 3d 698, 703 (1st Dist. 1990) \n(construing  “housing  accommodations”  in  the  IHRA  to  include  living  facilities  for \nbackstretch workers). \nThe District’s argument that schools are permitted to discriminate in ways that other \npublic accommodations are not would defeat the Act’s purpose and lead to absurd results.  \nSee In re B.C., 176 Ill. 2d 536, 550–51 (1997) (statutes “must be interpreted in a manner \nthat avoids absurd, unjust, unreasonable or inconvenient results which could not have been \nintended by the legislature”; rejecting interpretation of Illinois Hate Crime that would have \nrequired proof that the defendant’s “offensive conduct was directed against a specific \nperson” and instead requiring proof only of “improper bias which motivates certain \ncriminal acts” because “[t]here is no indication that the legislature intended only to redress \nthe narrower wrong caused by biased selection of victims”).  See also In re D.F., 208 Ill. \n2d 223, 230, 232 (2003) (“A court, however, is not bound by the literal language of a statute \nthat produces a result inconsistent with clearly expressed legislative intent, or that yields \nabsurd or unjust consequences not contemplated by the legislature”; rejecting proposed \nliteral reading of statute that “could only result in delaying a child’s permanent placement \nand cannot be reconciled with the legislature’s expressly stated policy to expedite juvenile \n  -15-   \n \n\n \ncourt proceedings”); People ex rel. Sherman v. Cryns, 203 Ill. 2d 264, 289–90 (2003) (“In \ninterpreting statutory provisions, we are to afford the statute’s plain language its fullest \nmeaning to effectuate the legislative intent . . . and we may not read into a statute \nexceptions, limitations or conditions that conflict with the intent of the legislature”; \nrejecting interpretation that individuals could avoid midwife licensure requirements by \nlabeling themselves “traditional nonnurse midwife” because it would lead to “an absurd \nresult” and “render a certified nurse midwife’s license meaningless”). \nIf the District were correct, then it and other educational institutions would be \nprohibited only from completely denying “access” to facilities and their goods and services \nto students who are transgender or from another protected class. Indeed, a school could set \nup separate sections within a locker room (or cafeteria or classroom) for different students \nbased on race, religion, or disability status.  Students of the targeted racial or religious \ngroup, or those with disabilities, would have no recourse under the Act.  \nBut those students’ lack of “full and equal enjoyment” would be simultaneously \nundeniable and legally irrelevant.  As the Illinois Supreme Court did in B.C. in interpreting \nthe Hate Crime Statute, this Court should avoid interpreting the Act to achieve a result \ninconsistent with the Legislature’s clearly expressed intent.  The Act is designed “to secure \nfor all individuals within Illinois the freedom from discrimination” on the basis of protected \nclass.  775 ILCS 5/1-102. \nThe  very  purpose  of  the  Act  is  to  strip  away  labels  and  require  public \naccommodations to treat all individuals equally.  Nova is female.  And she is transgender.  \nTreating her differently — requiring her to do, because of who she is, what no one else \nmust do — is the very vice the Act was meant to fix.  The only reason the District treated \n  -16-   \n \n\n \nNova differently is because of who she is.  The Act does not permit it to do so.  She is \nentitled to an injunction. \nII.  Nova Is Entitled to Preliminary Injunctive Relief. \nNova is entitled to a preliminary injunction because she has established  “(1) a clear, \nascertainable, protectable right; (2) irreparable injury; (3) inadequate remedy at law; and \n(4) likelihood of success on the merits,” Stanton, 177 Ill. App. 3d at 522, and because the \nbalance  of  harms  and  public  interest  weigh  in  favor  of  enjoining  the  District’s \ndiscriminatory policy.   \nFirst, Nova has a clear, ascertainable, and protectable right.  She has the right to \nfull and equal enjoyment of the District’s locker room facilities.  There is no dispute that \nthe District has denied her that right because of her gender identity: the District has \nconditioned Nova’s access to the girls’ locker room on her use of a stall separating her \nfrom the other girls, a requirement that is imposed solely on her and solely because she is \na girl who is transgender.  A. 67–67; A. 71.  With the Act interpreted as the legislature \nintended, Nova has established a clear, ascertainable, protectable right. \nSecond, as the trial court agreed, she has also established irreparable injury.  A. 27–\n28.  The District’s policy of unlawful discrimination reinforces the misconception that \nNova is not a “real” girl.  A. 67.  By distinguishing Nova as an “outcast” who must be \nseparated from other female students, the District has knowingly exacerbated Nova’s \ngender dysphoria.  Id.  The harm experienced by individuals diagnosed with gender \ndysphoria when they are treated in ways that are inconsistent with their innate gender \nidentity is understood to be “deeply traumatic, particularly for adolescents.”  A. 80–81.  By \nenacting a policy that regulates Nova’s use of the facility in a way that effectively \nsegregates her from her peers, the District has consciously signaled that Nova is “different” \n  -17-   \n \n\n \nthan other female students and implies that she should somehow be ashamed of who she \nis.  A. 67; A. 81.  Furthermore, medical research has demonstrated that the opportunity to \nuse “the same facilities available to others is an undeniable necessity for transgender \nindividuals.”  A. 81.  Therefore, by limiting Nova’s use of the locker room, the District has \nimpeded Nova’s ability to effectively treat and overcome her gender dysphoria, and the \nassociated distress and depression with feeling as though the body in which one is born \ndeeply conflicts with one’s sense of self — being made to feel as though one can never live \na life consistent with one’s true identity is plainly a form of “irreparable harm.”  See \nWhitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F. 3d 1034, 1045 (7th Cir. \n2017) (affirming preliminary injunction; school policy preventing transgender boy from \nusing the boy’s restroom; was “significantly and negatively impact[ing] his mental health \nand overall well-being” and causing life-long harm). \nThird, as the trial court found, Nova established that she has no adequate remedy at \nlaw.  A. 27–28.  Without a preliminary injunction, Nova will never again have the \nopportunity to enjoy a typical high school P.E. experience.  See, e.g., Doe v. Wood Cty. Bd. \nof Ed., 888 F. Supp. 2d 771, 778 (S.D. W. Va. 2012).  The only remedy for the harm is to \noverturn the policy.  \nFourth, Nova has established likelihood of success on the merits.  Again, under a \ncorrect interpretation of the Act, Nova would have prevailed.  The Act prevents schools \nfrom denying “full and equal access” of facilities to individuals on the basis of their gender \nidentity. 775 ILCS 5/1-103(O-1), 1-103(Q), and 5-102.  The District’s policy prevents \nNova from fully and equally using the girls’ locker room solely because of her gender \nidentity, an undisputed fact.  A. 28–31.  Because the District’s policy, as a matter of law, \n  -18-   \n \n\n \nviolates Nova’s civil rights, she has a strong likelihood of success on the merits.   \nAnd because the District has clearly violated Nova’s civil rights, no hardship \nbalance is even necessary.  See, e.g., Kalbfleisch, 396 Ill. App. 3d at 1119 (balancing \nagainst school district’s potential harm not required “where the existence of a private right \nand the violation thereof are clear”).  But if the Court decided to undertake the balancing \ninquiry, this is not a close case.  The District has identified no valid consideration to weigh \nagainst the harm Nova has suffered, and continues to suffer.  Actual or threatened litigation \nby SPP and other  anti-transgender organizations is not a “harm” that counts in the \nbalancing inquiry.  See Lammers v. Ill. Dep’t of Human Rights, Charge No. 1992 CN 3157, \n1996 WL 651361, at *2 (Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n. October 28, 1996) (“[I]t is black letter \nlaw that discrimination against an individual cannot be justified by the discriminatory \npreferences of customers”); Sommerville, ALS No. 13-0060C, at 11 (“[t]he prejudices of \nco-workers and customers are part of what the Act was meant to prevent”); Sprinkle v. \nRivers Edge Complex, Inc., ALS No. 10565, 2000 WL 33309367, at *10 (Ill. Hum. Rts. \nComm’n August 7, 2000) (“an employer cannot take action against a person based upon \nthe discriminatory preferences of the employer’s customers”).  As for the public’s interest, \nthe legislature has already spoken:  the Act’s purpose is “[t]o secure for all individuals \nwithin Illinois the freedom from discrimination.” 775 ILCS 5/1-102.  Denial of injunctive \nrelief under the facts and circumstances of this case will only frustrate that purpose. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  trial  court’s  order  denying  the  request  for  a \npreliminary injunction should be reversed and the case remanded with directions to grant \nthe preliminary injunction. \n  -19-   \n \n\n \n          Respectfully submitted, \nDated:  March 23, 2018 \nJohn Knight, Attorney No. 45404  Jeffrey H.

District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 5\n1 parties submitted briefs and we had argument on that\n2 matter last Friday, and I've had a chance to review\n3 the submissions and further study the cases and law\n4 on this subject matter and I'm ready to rule.\n5 So first we'll start by just giving a\n6 short synopsis of the facts or the background which\n7 has brought the parties to this point.\n8 So Ms. Maday is now 18 years old and\n9 she's a senior at Palatine High School.  She\n10 identifies as a female but is anatomically a male.\n11 The Plaintiff alleges that the District, the School\n12 District, has denied her the use of the girls' locker\n13 room while permitting other non-transgender girls'\n14 use of the locker room to change.\n15 The District most recently has offered\n16 Plaintiff and implemented a policy of allowing\n17 Plaintiff to use the girls' locker room but only if\n18 she agreed to change her clothes in the changing\n19 stall within the locker room.  And rather than use\n20 the locker room under those conditions, Ms. Maday\n21 accepted a waiver from participating in PE class.\n22 Subsequent to that change in policy or\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA009\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 6\n1 evolution of policy, Plaintiff's mother because she\n2 was a minor filed a charge on her behalf against\n3 District 211 with the Illinois Department of Human\n4 Rights and the Department issued a notice of\n5 dismissal for lack of substantial evidence after\n6 reviewing the matter on September 6, 2017.  After\n7 which, Ms. Maday filed this one-count complaint in\n8 the Circuit Court of Cook County alleging a violation\n9 of the Illinois Human Rights Act, and that complaint\n10 was filed on November 30th, 2017.\n11 Plaintiff's claim rests upon the theory\n12 that the Illinois Human Rights Act intends to prevent\n13 and eliminate discriminatory practices and Plaintiff\n14 is being discriminated against because she is a\n15 transgender female.\n16 Plaintiff believes that she should have\n17 the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities at a\n18 public place of accommodation, which is Palatine High\n19 School.  Plaintiff also sought injunctive relief so\n20 that she can register for PE class this year before\n21 she graduates.\n22 So let's talk first about the complaint\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA010\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 7\n1 which -- and the legal theory upon which it's based\n2 I've already alluded to that in a broad sense.  The\n3 complaint is a one-count complaint and it's firmly\n4 founded upon the Illinois Human Rights Act.\n5 Now, it's Count 1 and the allegation,\n6 the heading is that District 211 denied Nova the full\n7 and equal access of its facilities because of Nova's\n8 gender-related identity, and it seeks a cease and\n9 desist order from the Court directing District 211 to\n10 allow her to use the locker room without any\n11 conditions.\n12 Now, just generally under the law for\n13 preliminary injunctions there has to be a\n14 foundational legal premise, and that can be\n15 accomplished in several ways but more often it's\n16 couched in these terms, that the Plaintiff has a\n17 burden to raise a fair question that she has a\n18 substantive interest recognized by statute or common\n19 law.  So the obvious basis and premise of this\n20 lawsuit is statutory.  Clearly, simply, narrowly,\n21 exclusively, statutory.  Illinois Human Rights Act.\n22 So that's our starting point, and it's\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA011\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 8\n1 our analysis point, and it's our conclusion point in\n2 my estimation.  So it's refreshing because many times\n3 the lawyers throw multiple theories and make for an\n4 entertaining discussion, but this is straightforward\n5 Illinois Human Rights Act.\n6 So I think I want to start by -- don't\n7 be afraid it's a book, nobody looks at books anymore,\n8 but it's all printed papers off the Internet.  But\n9 I'm looking at the 775 ILCS 5/1-101, which is the\n10 reference to the Illinois Human Rights Act, and just\n11 when I did print it out it's 75 pages in length so\n12 it's very detailed and it's evolved over the years.\n13 But I think we have to start out with\n14 the premise of legislative intent and the effective\n15 date.  This law was passed in 1979, December 6, 1979,\n16 and became effective July 1, 1980.  So it's been\n17 around a long time.\n18 And I'm just going to read into the\n19 record the title of the Act.  The title of the Act is\n20 as follows:  \"An Act to promote the public health,\n21 welfare, and safety of the people of the State of\n22 Illinois by preventing unlawful discrimination in\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA012\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 9\n1 employment, real property transactions, access to\n2 financial credit, and public accommodations by\n3 authorizing the creation of a Department of Human\n4 Rights to enforce, and a Human Rights Commission to\n5 adjudicate allegations of unlawful discrimination and\n6 by making uniform the law with reference to unlawful\n7 discrimination through the addition, amendment, and\n8 repeal of various Acts.\"\n9 So the 1980 Illinois Human Rights Act\n10 comes into existence.  Now, let's talk about how it\n11 came into existence.  Quite obviously and plainly the\n12 Illinois legislature.  Now, the Illinois legislature\n13 like all legislatures is comprised of people who are\n14 elected by the citizens, and of course they are\n15 charged with the task of balancing society's\n16 interests, they act in response to public input and\n17 public requests.  And accordingly, as we all know\n18 when we -- as you've all been lawyers for a while,\n19 things change, mostly they grow in number of pages.\n20 As I said, the Illinois Human Rights Act is now\n21 75 pages when I printed it out on the Internet, and\n22 things change.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA013\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 10\n1 As an example, in my early career I was\n2 a Public Defender and I had a Chapter 38 which was a\n3 Criminal Code and that was my Bible and that's what I\n4 worked with for eight or nine years.  When I first\n5 arrived there in 1977, that pamphlet book was about\n6 half inch long -- wide or deep.  By the time I left,\n7 it was an inch and a half eight or nine years later.\n8 So the point is legislation changes and\n9 I don't think it's important for the purposes of our\n10 case to analyze that further, but I think it's\n11 important to note because this law, especially a\n12 couple of sections here that deal with Ms. Maday's\n13 circumstances, has had some amendments and some\n14 changes.\n15 So I want to look at that first.  And\n16 first, I want to focus on Article 5 of the Human\n17 Rights Act which is titled Public Accommodations, and\n18 there are definitions.\n19 In 5/5-101 is a Definition section and\n20 it reads as follows:  \"The following definitions are\n21 applicable strictly in the context of this Article.\n22 (A)  Place of Public Accommodation.  \"Place of public\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA014\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 11\n1 accommodation\" includes, but is not limited to:\" and\n2 there's a list of 13, and I'm just going to summarize\n3 it.  Number (1) an inn, hotel, motel;\n4 (2) a restaurant, bar; (3) a motion picture house,\n5 theater, concert hall; (4) auditorium, convention\n6 center, lecture hall; (5) bakery, grocery store,\n7 clothing store, shopping center; (6) laundromat,\n8 dry-cleaner, bank, barber shop, beauty shop,\n9 accountant, lawyer, office; (7) public conveyances on\n10 air, water or land; (8) a terminal, depot, or other\n11 station used for public transportation; (9) museum,\n12 library, gallery; (10) park, zoo, amusement park;\n13 (11) a non-sectarian nursery, day care center,\n14 elementary, secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate\n15 school, or other place of education; (12) a senior\n16 center, homeless shelter, food bank;\n17 (13) a gymnasium, health spa, bowling alley.\n18 Okay.  So there's a list and\n19 description and definition promulgated by the\n20 legislature of what they mean by public\n21 accommodation, or what falls under the umbrella of a\n22 place of public accommodation.  So those definitions\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA015\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 12\n1 are in the Act.\n2 Now, let's move on, the timeline of,\n3 and move to October 10th of 2007.  The legislators\n4 amended a portion of this Act under 5/5-102, which\n5 reads:  \"It is a civil rights violation for any\n6 person on the basis of unlawful discrimination\n7 to: (A),\" and then there's a caption or a title\n8 that's called \"Enjoyment of Facilities, Goods, and\n9 Services.\"\n10 So it's unlawful discrimination to:\n11 \"Deny or refuse to another the full and equal\n12 enjoyment of the facilities, goods, and services of\n13 any public place of accommodation.\"  So that\n14 amendment was effective October 10th, 2007.\n15 Next in our legislative history, the\n16 next important date is January 1st, 2010, and we have\n17 a new amendment to the Human Rights Act, Article 5,\n18 Public Accommodations, and this amendment is titled\n19 775 ILCS 5/5-102.2, and the title is Jurisdiction\n20 Limited.\n21 And it reads as follows:  \"In regard to\n22 places of public accommodation defined in\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA016\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 13\n1 paragraph 11 of Section 5-101, the jurisdiction of\n2 the Department is limited to:  (1) the failure to\n3 enroll an individual; (2) the denial of access to\n4 facilities, goods, or services; or (3) severe or\n5 pervasive harassment of an individual when the\n6 covered entity fails to take corrective action to\n7 stop the severe or pervasive harassment.\"\n8 All right.  So what did this amendment\n9 do?  And for our purposes we're only utilizing this\n10 for the second category, \"the denial of access to\n11 facilities, goods, or services.\"  So what was the\n12 effect of this amendment and why is it there, what\n13 does it stand for now?  So we're searching for, as\n14 always, legislative intent when we're dealing with a\n15 statutory cause of action which is what we have here.\n16 So let's go back to the definitions in\n17 that laundry list that I read in abbreviated fashion.\n18 And in 2010 the legislator went back to that section\n19 of the Human Rights Act and he plucked out one and\n20 only one place of public accommodation, and they\n21 carved out some different -- a different rule or a\n22 different analysis or a different jurisdictional\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA017\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 14\n1 authority or definition, so to say.\n2 Now, why did they do that?  Well, I\n3 don't know.  So we start analyzing.  If you look at\n4 all those places of public accommodation that exist\n5 in that definition section, this section, this\n6 particular section deals with schools, day care\n7 center, elementary, secondary, undergraduate,\n8 postgraduate school, or other place of education.\n9 Plain and simple.  Education.  Educational venue,\n10 educational facility, educational vocation.\n11 Education.\n12 And when they did this and highlighted\n13 this one category there's also a different\n14 description of access and there's -- the words are\n15 different as we all know because we talked about it\n16 at length last Friday.  And 102 before this\n17 amendment, this change in the statute, well, it still\n18 reads \"full and equal enjoyment of the facilities.\"\n19 So it's unlawful discrimination to deny or refuse to\n20 another the full and equal enjoyment of the\n21 facilities, goods, and the services.\n22 Now, 2-1/2 or 3 years later the\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA018\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 15\n1 legislature speaking only to this one definition of\n2 accommodation, only to the educational category, they\n3 don't include the words \"full and equal enjoyment.\"\n4 They describe it differently, that it would be\n5 unlawful to:  \"For the denial of access to\n6 facilities, goods, or services.\"\n7 Now, is that an accident?  Something\n8 this critical and important to our citizens of\n9 Illinois to be free from discrimination and not be\n10 discriminated against, is it an accident?  I don't\n11 know.  Well, I'll talk about that in a minute but\n12 we're not mind readers, but reasonable people could\n13 analyze and make a suggestion or offer possible\n14 reasoning for that.\n15 Education.  Education is not going to\n16 the movies.  Public education is the most, if not the\n17 single most important mission of our government.\n18 It's certainly up there at the top of the list.  It's\n19 mandatory.  Our education laws require that students\n20 attend school, otherwise -- I don't think they have\n21 truant officers anymore, but you have to attend\n22 school.  Parents hand off their minor children to\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA019\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 16\n1 teachers, and teachers act in our school system as\n2 almost quasi-parental in nature.  Many people argue\n3 that the teachers spend more time with the kids than\n4 the parents.  I'm sure we've all heard people dwell\n5 on that.  They're minors.  I don't know.  They're\n6 developing emotionally and physically.  They're\n7 adolescents.  Minors can't contract, they can't drive\n8 a car until they are 16 years old, and they can't --\n9 so I don't know.  Okay?  And I'm not speculating,\n10 just for the record.  So wherever this goes after me,\n11 I'm not speculating.  I'm just talking about\n12 reasonable explanations.  There could be reasonable\n13 ones on the other side.\n14 So we need guidelines, \"we\" meaning the\n15 Courts, when we have these disputes over legislative\n16 intent and what words mean and what they don't mean.\n17 And there are guidelines and the parties, you know,\n18 discuss them in their briefs, statutory construction,\n19 and I'm just going to read a few of the more\n20 straightforward fundamental rules.\n21 So typically when the Court interprets\n22 a statute, the fundamental rule of statutory\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA020\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 17\n1 construction is to ascertain and give effect to the\n2 legislature's intent.  Moreover, the language of the\n3 statute is the best indicator of legislative intent,\n4 and we give that language its plain and ordinary\n5 meaning.\n6 Lastly, the Court may not depart from\n7 the plain language of the statute by reading into it\n8 exceptions, limitations, or conditions that would\n9 conflict with the express legislative intent.\n10 Now, it's clear that what's missing in\n11 the amendment, or what's different I should say in\n12 the 2002 carveout -- I'm calling it a carveout,\n13 that's not a legal term, but just for sake of our\n14 discussion.  What's missing are those words \"full and\n15 equal access.\"  They are conspicuously not there in\n16 the definition, or in the statute I should say.\n17 Whereas, they are there and apply to all the other\n18 public accommodations, the 12 others that I listed\n19 and described generally.  So that's a fact, those\n20 words aren't there.  Now, that's the statute.\n21 Let's move on to the request for\n22 preliminary injunctive relief.  And before we get to\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA021\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 18\n1 that legal discussion of preliminary injunctive\n2 relief, I think I'm going to start by saying the\n3 obvious, at least to the lawyers and to those who\n4 have had equitable causes of action and litigated,\n5 and that is the law describes preliminary injunctive\n6 relief as extraordinary.  And I never quite\n7 understood what that meant, and I don't know that I\n8 ever still do, but I say that in jest because I sit\n9 here over the years and that's the word that's used\n10 every time, that injunctive relief is an\n11 extraordinary remedy.\n12 And so just for laughs I went to the\n13 dictionary to look at -- the legal dictionary and\n14 it's defined as \"going beyond what is usual, regular,\n15 or customary; of, relating to, or having the nature\n16 of a proceeding or action not normally required by\n17 law or not prescribed for the regular administration\n18 of law.\"\n19 So I don't know that it's helped me any\n20 but I tell you what I -- I would offer this in terms\n21 of my thoughts on why it's called extraordinary.\n22 Well, in the ordinary course of litigation without\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA022\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 19\n1 injunctive requests, here's what happens.  A party\n2 files a lawsuit, the other party responds.  The\n3 parties exchange information that's relevant to that\n4 lawsuit, they depose people, hire experts, and it\n5 goes on until all the facts are assembled, and those\n6 facts are presented to either a Judge or a jury and\n7 there is a decision based on evidence.\n8 Under injunctive relief there is no\n9 decision based on evidence, so I'm thinking in my\n10 mind that's why we call it extraordinary because it's\n11 not our standard way of deciding disputes in our\n12 American jurisprudence.\n13 In any event it's extraordinary,\n14 however parties want to define it.  That's not a\n15 legal definition, that's not the Court's definition,\n16 or some Appellate Court, but I think it's a common\n17 sense look at that because what we do in a\n18 preliminary injunction and in TRO's is the Court,\n19 whether it's me or whoever it is, in essence has to\n20 have -- pretend it has a crystal ball and can look\n21 out into the crystal ball and predict the outcome,\n22 the likely outcome of the litigation.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA023\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 20\n1 So I just start with that premise that\n2 extraordinary is attached all the time, every time,\n3 exclusively to injunctive requests.\n4 Now, let's look at the elements that\n5 are necessary for a Plaintiff to prevail.  First, I\n6 want to just add a few more comments regarding what I\n7 glean from the briefs and the narrative here because\n8 I think some of this needs to be highlighted.\n9 The Plaintiff's brief in support of the\n10 motion for preliminary injunction, in two places I\n11 think in the brief references -- well, let me just\n12 read it.  \"To date the District has either denied\n13 Nova the use of the locker rooms used by the other\n14 girls all together, or told her that she would be\n15 separated and required to dress in a private area in\n16 the girls' locker room away from the other girls.\"\n17 Then later on in the brief it's\n18 mentioned again or in a little different terms:  \"The\n19 District's most recent offer to Nova made in 2017,\n20 July, was for her to be separated from the other\n21 girls by requiring her to dress in a private area in\n22 the girls' locker room away from the other girls.\"\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA024\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 21\n1 I understand that, you know, this is a\n2 brief but my understanding from the discussion, the\n3 arguments, the submitted briefs is that the locker\n4 room is an open room like this with rows of lockers.\n5 The stalls are not bathroom stalls, they're -- I\n6 think that was described as four stalls, and they're\n7 two or maybe five feet off the end of the row of\n8 lockers from what I could see or, you know, it's --\n9 that gives the impression that this is a separate\n10 room.  I don't think that it's a separate room.\n11 There's no door, it's wide open, and it's a changing\n12 area for girls that wish to avail themselves of it, I\n13 guess, but it's part of the locker room I think, and\n14 I think that's an important fact that needs to be\n15 clarified.\n16 So here's the elements that a Plaintiff\n17 has to establish.  First, a clearly ascertained right\n18 and need of protection; second, that irreparable harm\n19 will occur without the injunction; third, there's not\n20 an adequate remedy at law; and fourth, there is a\n21 likelihood of success on the merits.\n22 And in addition to that the Court can\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA025\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 22\n1 balance hardships between the parties, and in\n2 balancing the equities the Court must weigh the\n3 benefits of granting the injunction against the\n4 possible injury to the opposing party from the\n5 injunction, and in balancing the equities the Court\n6 should consider the effect of the injunction on the\n7 public.\n8 So let's address the first element,\n9 ascertainable right in need of protection.  Now here\n10 Ms. Maday argues that she has a right to the full and\n11 equal enjoyment of the facilities, meaning that she\n12 has the right to unrestricted access to the girls'\n13 locker room as the other girls use the locker room at\n14 Palatine High School.\n15 District, on the other hand, argues\n16 that the Plaintiff misapplied the relevant law and\n17 that Section 102.2, the January 2010 amendment, is\n18 the section that applies and not the section that\n19 reads \"full and equal enjoyment of the facilities.\"\n20 So I have already discussed how that\n21 evolved, that paragraph 11 of the Definition section\n22 was singled out in the 2010 amendment, and \"full and\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA026\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 23\n1 equal\" was not attached to that amendment.\n2 So the question is whether Ms. Maday\n3 has -- if 102.2 applies, the question is her\n4 protectable right, arguably, is access to the\n5 facilities.  Defendant, the District, submits, argues\n6 and suggests that she has access to the facilities\n7 and that the access is to the locker room and the\n8 changing stalls which are part of the locker room,\n9 and that's their argument.\n10 So the question is whether that statute\n11 as amended, carving out educational institutions,\n12 should be given the interpretation that Defendant is\n13 suggesting.  And if it is then the ascertainable\n14 right is not to full and equal access to the\n15 facilities and thereby her right in need of\n16 protection should be analyzed with the amended\n17 section, namely, does she have access to the\n18 facilities.\n19 Now, let's move to the two other\n20 elements, irreparable harm without the injunction and\n21 no adequate remedy at law.  I would submit that those\n22 elements are likely established by the Plaintiff, no\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA027\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 24\n1 adequate remedy at law or irreparable harm, based on\n2 the briefs, based on the arguments and based on the\n3 facts.\n4 Likelihood of success on the merits,\n5 and this is where the crystal ball comes into play,\n6 and that is where this case, in my judgment, is to be\n7 decided.  And the Illinois Human Rights Act addresses\n8 unlawful discrimination, not just discrimination, but\n9 5/5-102 reads:  \"It is a civil rights violation for\n10 any person on the basis of unlawful discrimination,\"\n11 and then it goes on to recite what.\n12 Now, if there's discrimination here as\n13 Plaintiff would argue, is it unlawful discrimination?\n14 And in analyzing that, the jurisdictional limited\n15 amendment of 102.2 is our guideline, and the\n16 guideline is that it's undeniable that\n17 Ms. Maday has access to the girls' locker room.  It's\n18 also undeniable that Plaintiff, Ms. Maday, and her\n19 attorneys argue that it's not full and equal access,\n20 and that may be a correct statement.  But I also\n21 cannot ignore the plain language of 102.2 which as a\n22 result of extricating the educational accommodations\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA028\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 25\n1 that were long a part of the definition section and\n2 that had to comply in the same way as those other\n3 institutions, you can't ignore that it was carved out\n4 and it was addressed in a different manner by the\n5 Illinois legislature.  And they didn't use the words\n6 \"full and equal,\" they used \"access.\"\n7 Again, going back to my comments\n8 earlier, I don't see any legislative record that can\n9 dispel the plain language.  They pulled it out, \"full\n10 and equal enjoyment.\"  They might have -- maybe they\n11 had their crystal ball in looking down the road and\n12 seeing that in an educational setting that they\n13 wanted a different standard based on the fact that\n14 they're legislators and they have to balance the\n15 world in their district, that they have parties on\n16 all sides of the issues talking to them all the time,\n17 I don't know.  But that language is different and it\n18 can't be a mistake, it can't be that they meant to\n19 put it in there because you don't go tip-toeing\n20 around something this important, the Illinois Human\n21 Rights Act, as a legislative scribe or assistant or\n22 Court and like make a mistake like that.  I don't\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA029\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 26\n1 think so.\n2 Well, in closing what I have to say is\n3 that this is, as I said when we got here last Friday,\n4 the balancing act of all balancing acts.  But I'm not\n5 here to be the -- and it's not my role to establish\n6 social lines up or down.  My role is to look at what\n7 has been presented to me.  And this is not a\n8 Constitutional argument, you're not over at\n9 219 South Dearborn in federal court.  This is plain\n10 and simple a statutory cause of action and I've got\n11 to analyze this within the four corners of that\n12 statute and not according to common law.  It's\n13 strictly the words that are put on paper by the\n14 legislature and signed by the Governor and amended\n15 from time to time as they always are and maybe there\n16 will be some amendment after this.  But the question\n17 is likelihood of success on the merits, take out my\n18 crystal ball, look at the statute.  The statute says\n19 access to the facility, and it doesn't say full and\n20 equal access, and it applies only to educational\n21 settings.  There's got to be a reason and it's not\n22 for me to ignore those words.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA030\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 27\n1 And therefore my ruling is this, that\n2 there's not a likelihood of success on the merits\n3 because of the statutory impediment, the statutory\n4 language, and it's clear that the School District on\n5 a high-wire balancing act has done what they could,\n6 but I'm not even going to say that because it doesn't\n7 matter.  But what they have done is they've allowed\n8 access.  Access, access, access, and I'm not going to\n9 go into, you know, the balancing act.  This is a --\n10 as I said the other day, parties on all sides, no\n11 one, no one wants to be in this situation, everybody\n12 wants this to work out perfectly.  As we all know, we\n13 don't live in a perfect world, everything is\n14 imperfect.\n15 Accommodation, cooperation,\n16 consideration, those are the words that were buzzing\n17 in my head as I looked at this over the last few\n18 days.  But I know my role, it's limited.  The statute\n19 brought us here, I'm looking at the statute, that's\n20 the way I interpret the statute, and therefore I\n21 don't think that there's a likelihood of success on\n22 the merits and I don't need to get to the other\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA031\n\nNova Maday v. District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 28\n1 balancing issues.\n2 So for those reasons I'm going to deny\n3 the motion for preliminary injunction.  And so I\n4 guess the Defendant has to answer the complaint\n5 because we got a one-count complaint here.  Although\n6 I was looking at that too.\n7 What are we doing here, Mr. Knight?  I\n8 was looking at the prayer for relief and it's\n9 basically this is the whole ball game.  I mean your\n10 prayer for relief, I've been trying to figure out.\n11 MR.

KNIGHT:  I think that --\n20 THE COURT:  So I don't want to engage in\n21 unnecessary measures here if you're -- obviously, if\n22 you're, you know, taking this up then I'll\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA032\n\nNova Maday v.

BERGMAN:  Sure.\n19 THE COURT:  -- legal work if we don't have\n20 to.

Nova asks this  Court to  enjoin Defendant, \nTownship High School District 211 (\"District 211\" or ''the District\") from denying her use of the \ngirls' locker room so she can change for and take physical education (\"P.E.\") during her last \nsemester at Palatine High School. To date, the District has either denied Nova the use of the locker \nroom used by the other girls altogether, or told her that she would be separated and required to \ndress in a private area in the girls' locker room, away from the other girls. \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nNova is a young woman and student at Palatine High School who, since May 2015, has \nbeen denied use of the girls' locker rooms because she is transgender. The Illinois Human Rights \nAct unambiguously prohibits discrimination on the basis of one's gender identity. Nonetheless, \nDistrict 211 has repeatedly denied Nova's requests to be treated the same as other girls and allowed \nto use the locker room. District 211 's discriminatory treatment of Nova has made her feel like an \noutcast who doesn't belong, isn't accepted as an equal member of the school, and is somehow less \nof a person. The District has humiliated Nova, caused her significant anxiety, and worsened her \ngender dysphoria by effectively telling her that her school does not accept her as a girl. \n1 \nA048\n\nNova is entitled to a preliminary injunction ordering the District to allow her to use the \nlocker room without requiring her to use a separate, private changing area because she has a \nprotectable right to the same use of the girls' locker room as non-transgender girls; she has a \nlikelihood of succeeding on the merits because there is no question the Illinois Human Rights Act \nprohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity; and denying her the use of the locker room \nis causing her irreparable harm that cannot be fully remedied through damages. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Parties. \nNova is a female high school senior. See Ex. A, Aff. of Nova Maday (\"Maday Aff.\") ~~ 1, \n4. She has attended Defendant's Palatine High School since she began the ninth grade in the fall \nof 2014. Maday Aff. at~ 1. Nova is passionate about art, especially photography, and also enjoys \ncomputer programming and astronomy. Id. at~ 2. Nova has been a model student: completing her \ncourse  work,  participating in  class,  maintaining  a  good  academic  record,  and  forming  and \nmaintaining friendships with a close group of her classmates who accept and respect her. Id. at ~ \n3. Nevertheless, the District insists on humiliating Nova by separating her from her classmates \nbecause she is transgender, and effectively telling her that she isn't really a girl. All Nova wants is \nto be treated like any other girl, and use the girls' locker room to change clothes for P.E. Id. at~ \n14. \nII.  Nova is Transgender and Has Been Diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria. \nNova is transgender, which means that she was assigned the male gender when she was \nborn even though she has known since she was very young that she is female. Maday Aff. at~ 4; \nW \nEx. B, Aff. of Brenda Schweda (\"Schweda Af£\")  2-3. She has been diagnosed with gender \ndysphoria, the medical diagnosis for individuals whose gender identity-their innate sense of their \n2 \nA049\n\ngender--differs from the gender they were assigned at birth and causes them clinically significant \ndistress. See Ex. C, Affidavit of Dr. Randi Ettner (\"Ettner Aff.\") iM[ 12-13, 28. \nIII.  Gender Dysphoria is a Serious and Internationally Recognized Medical Condition. \nThe term \"gender identity\" is a well-established concept in medicine, referring to one's \nsense of oneself as belonging to a particular gender. Id.  at ,-r 8. All human beings develop this \nelemental internal view: the conviction of belonging to a gender, such as male or female. Id. \nGender identity is firmly established early in life. Id.  Most people have a gender identity that \nmatches their gender assigned at birth, but transgender people's gender identity fails to match the \ngender they were assigned when born, giving rise to a sense of being \"wrongly embodied.\" Id. at \n,-r 9. The medical diagnosis for this feeling of incongruence is gender dysphoria. Id. at ,-i 12. \nGender  dysphoria  is  a  serious  medical  condition  codified  in  the  DSM-V  and  the \nInternational Classification of Diseases-I 0 (yvo  rld Health Organization). Id.  The condition is \nmanifested by symptoms such as a preoccupation with ridding oneself of primary and secondary \nsex characteristics. Id.  Untreated gender dysphoria can result in significant clinical distress and \ndebilitating depression, and often suicidal thoughts and acts. Id.; see also De 'lonta v. Johnson, \n708 F.3d 520, 525-26 (4th Cir. 2013) (recognizing treatment for gender dysphoria as a serious \nmedical need under the Eighth Amendment). The criteria for diagnosing gender dysphoria in \nadolescents and adults are set forth in the DSM-V (302.85). Ettner Aff. at ,-r 13. \nAdditionally, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (\"WP ATH\") has \nestablished internationally accepted Standards of Care (\"SOC\") for the treatment of people with \ngender dysphoria. Id. at ,-i 14. The SOC have been endorsed as the authoritative standards of care \nby leading medical and mental health organizations, including the American Medical Association, \nthe Endocrine Society, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological \n3 \nA050\n\nAssociation. Id.; see also De 'lonta, 708 F.3d at 522-23 (recognizing that \"[t]he Standards of Care, \npublished by the World Professional Association of Trans gender Health, are the generally accepted \nprotocols for the treatment of [gender dysphoria] \"). The SOC recommend that individuals undergo \na medically-supervised transition to live in alignment with their gender identity. Ettner Aff. at~ \n15. Treatment of gender dysphoria can consist of social role transition, psychotherapy, hormone \ntherapy, and surgery to alter primary and secondary sex characteristics. Id. at~ 16. \nFor adolescents of Nova's age, the medically recommended treatment typically consists of \nsocial role transition, and may also consist of hormone therapy. Id.  at ~ 15. Cross-sex hormone \ntherapy results in an adolescent developing secondary sex characteristics consistent with their \ngender identity. Id.  at~ 19. Social role transition allows transgender adolescents to integrate into \nsociety in a manner consistent with their gender identity. Id. at ~ 18. This transition takes place at \nhome, in the community, and at school. Id.  However, if any aspect of social role transition is \nobstructed, it can destabilize the patient and undermine the treatment goals. Id.  at~ 20. In other \nwords, \"[f] or a gender dysphoric adolescent to be consideredf emale in one situation, for example, \nbut not in another is inconsistent with evidence-based medical practice and detrimental to the \nhealth and well-being oft he individual, regardless ofa ge.\" Id. at~ 21 (emphasis added). \nIV.  Nova Transitioned to Living and Presenting as a Girl More Than Three Years Ago. \nNova first told her family she was a girl on March 29, 2014, before her freshman year at \nPalatine High School. Maday Aff. at~ 5. She did so, because she could no longer go on avoiding \nmirrors and photographs that reflected her as a boy. Nor could she continue isolating herself in her \nroom and staying away from friends and others who would see her as a boy. Her anxiety about \ntrying to find a way to free her true self as a girl and to stop being seen as a boy had reached the \npoint that she simply could not going on living that way. Id.  In March or April of 2014, Nova \n4 \nA051\n\nsought medical treatment for the depression and anxiety this conflict was causing her. She was \ndiagnosed with gender dysphoria, and has been continuously treated for the condition since then. \nId. at ii 6. \nTo help resolve the conflict that led to Nova's gender dysphoria diagnosis, she began \ngrowing out her hair and dressing and grooming consistent with the styles of other girls her age at \nher school. Id. at ii 7. Since September of2014, Nova has presented fully and exclusively as a girl \noutside of school by also using a traditionally feminine name, and female restrooms in public \nplaces. Id.;  Schweda Aff.  at ii 6.  In October 2016, Nova started feminizing hormone therapy. \nMaday Af£ at ii 6. She is also in the process of legally changing her name, which should be \ncompleted by January 2018. Id. at ii 8. \nNova has presented herself fully as a girl at school since October 2014. Maday Aff. at ii 8; \nSchweda Aff. at ii 7. At school, she uses a female name, female pronouns, and dresses and grooms \nlike the other girls at her school. Maday Aff. at W 7-8. Also, Nova's teachers and peers have \nreferred to her by her female name and female pronouns since October 2014. Id. at ii 8. Nova also \nhas used the girls' restrooms at school since May 2016. Id. at ii 7. Her school records and school \nI.D. card list her as female. Id. at ii 8. \nV.  District 211 has Repeatedly Denied Nova Use of the Girls' Locker Room. \nSince at least May 2015, Nova and her mother have repeatedly requested that District \nofficials allow her to use the girls' locker room so that she can change her clothes for P.E. Maday \nAff. at ii 9; Schweda Aff. at ii 9. Their requests have been repeatedly denied. Maday Aff. at ii 12; \nSchweda Aff. at ii 10. Initially, the District refused Nova's request to use the girls' locker room at \nall. Maday Aff. at ii 9. Instead, she was told that she could change for P .E. in one of the restrooms \nin the school nurse's office ancJ later she was told that should could use a single-user locker room \n5 \nA052\n\nthat would remain locked until Nova requested that school staff let her in to change her clothes \nbefore and after P.E. Id. at ,-r 10. \nChanging in the nurse's office and the single-user locker room instead of the girls' locker \nroom often caused Nova to be late for P.E., which exacerbated her gender dysphoria and caused \nher significant anxiety and distress. Id. at ,-r 11. Nevertheless, the District continued to deny Nova \nuse of the locker room used by other girls. Id. at ,-r 12. As a result, in August 2016 Nova accepted \na waiver of the requirement that she take P.E. for the second semester for her junior year (2016-\n2017). Id. \nThe District's most recent offer to Nova, made in July 2017, was for her to be separated \nfrom the other girls by requiring her to dress in a private area in the girls' locker room, away from \nthe other girls. Id.  at ,-r 13. Nova and her mother refused that offer because the District does not \nrequire non-trans gender girls to dress in a separate area in the locker room, and because mandatory \nseparation from other girls indicated to Nova and to other girls that Nova is different-not a \"real\" \ngirl. Maday Aff. at ,-i,-r 14, 16; Schweda Aff. at ,-i 11. That is an intolerable message for anyone to \nhear, and especially for a young trans gender person. For that reason, Nova and her mother accepted \nanother waiver from the P.E. requirement. Maday Aff. at ,-i 14; Schweda Aff. at ,-i 12. \nLike many other female students who change in the locker room, Nova values her privacy, \nand she would take steps to discretely change her own clothes and not observe anyone else's \nchanging habits or bodies. Maday Aff. at ,-r 15. She is modest about her body, and like many other \ngirls she would take steps to avoid other students seeing her naked body in the locker room. Id. If \nthe District is concerned that other girls will see Nova naked in the locker room, Nova-like most \nteenage girls--doesn't want them too, either. Thus, requiring Nova to change in a private area \nserves no purpose but to treat her differently than other female students because she is transgender. \n6 \nA053\n\nPROCEDURAL POSTURE \nBecause the District denied Nova the use of the girls' locker room at school, Nova's mother \nfiled a Charge of Discrimination (the \"Charge\") with the Illinois Department of Human Rights \n(\"IDHR\")  on  Nova's  behalf  Ex.  D,  IDHR  Charge.  The  Charge  alleged  that  the  District \ndiscriminated against Nova on the basis of her gender-related identity. \nOn  or about September 6,  2016,  IDHR mailed its Notice of Dismissal  for  Lack  of \nSubstantial Evidence (the \"Notice of Dismissal\"), which Nova's counsel did not receive until \nOctober 11, 2017 .1 The Illinois Human Rights Act (\"IHRA\") provides that when IDHR dismisses \na charge for lack of substantial evidence, the complainant may seek review of the dismissal order \nbefore the Human Rights Commission or commence a civil action in the appropriate circuit court. \n775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(3). Rather than seeking review of the IDHR findings, Nova elected to \ncommence a civil action and filed her Complaint with this Court on November 30, 2017. This \nCourt should afford no deference to IDHR's erroneous conclusions, since in these circumstances \na \"circuit court ... hears the claim de novo rather than by administrative review.\" Vulpitta v. Walsh \nConst. Co., 2016 IL App (1st) 152203, if 16 (citing 775 ILCS 5/8-11 l(A) (2012)), appeal denied, \n77 N.E.3d 86 (Ill. 2017). \nLEGAL STANDARD \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, Nova must establish the following four factors: \"(1) a \nclear, ascertainable, protectable right; (2) irreparable injury; (3) inadequate remedy at law; and (4) \nlikelihood of success on the merits.\" Stanton v.  City of Chicago, 177 Ill. App. 3d 519, 522 (1st \nDist. 1988); see also In re Estate of Wilson, 373 Ill. App. 3d 1066, 1075 (1st Dist. 2007). \"[A] \nparty seeking injunctive relief need only raise a 'fair question' as to the existence of the right \n1 The more than a month delay was caused by IDHR's mailing the notice to the old address for \nNova's attorney, even though her attorney had advised IDHR of the new address. \n7 \nA054\n\nclaimed.\" George S. May Intern. Co. v. Intern. Profit Assocs., 256 Ill. App. 3d 779, 786-87 (1st \nDist. 1993) (citing Buzz Barton &Assocs. v. Giannone, 108 Ill. 2d 373, 382 (1985)). \nAlthough preliminary injunctive relief generally preserves the status  quo,  it can also \nprevent a threatened wrong or the further perpetration of an injurious act until the merits of the \ncase can be decided. Kalbfleisch v. Columbia Community Unit School Dist. No. 4, 396 Ill. App. 3d \n1105, 1117-18 (5th Dist. 2009) (injunctive relief that ordered school to allow service animal to \naccompany student to  school, which altered the status quo,  was permissible to  prevent the \nprospective harm sought to be avoided by the relief sought); see also Brooks v. LaSalle National \nBank, 11 Ill. App. 3d 791, 798-99 (1st Dist. 1973); Kolstad v. Rankin, 179 Ill. App. 3d 1022, 1034 \n(4th Dist. 1989). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Nova Has A Clearly Ascertainable and Protectable Right to Use the Girls' Locker \nRoom. \nThe IHRA explicitly makes it unlawful for District 211 to deny Nova use of the girls' locker \nroom because Nova is transgender. The IHRA provides that \"[i]t is a civil rights violation for any \nperson on the basis of unlawful discrimination to ... [d]eny or refuse to another the full and equal \nenjoyment of the facilities, goods, and services of any public place of accommodation.\" 775 ILCS \n5/5-102. A \"secondary school,\" such as Palatine High School, is a place of public accommodation. \nId. at 5/5-101 (A)(l 1). '\"Unlawful discrimination' means discrimination against a person because \nof his or her ... sexual orientation ... as th[is] term [is] defined in this Section.\" Id. at 5/1-103(Q). \n\"'Sexual orientation' means actual or perceived ... gender-related identity, whether or not \ntraditionally associated  with the person's designated  sex  at birth.\" Id.  at  5/1-103(0-1) \n(emphasis added). Thus, the text of the IHRA unambiguously makes it unlawful for District 211 \nto deny Nova \"full and equal enjoyment of the facilities,\" id. at 5/5-102, at District 211, including \n8 \nA055\n\nuse of the girls' locker room, because she is transgender, and therefore her gender-related identity \ndoes not match her gender assigned at birth. \nThere is no question that it is unlawful discrimination to deny someone the use of a gender-\nsegregated restroom or locker room that matches the person's gender identity, because that person \nis transgender.2 The Illinois Human Rights Commission recently found that Hobby Lobby Stores \nviolated a female employee's rights under the IHRA by denying her use of the women's restroom \nused by other female employees and customers because she is transgender. See Ex. E, Sommerville \nv.  Hobby Lobby Stores,  ALS No.  13-0060C (Ill.  Hum.  Rts.  Comm'n 2015) (May 15, 2015 \nRecommended Liability Determination) (adopted in relevant part by Commission, Nov. 2, 2016). \nThe Commission found that Hobby Lobby violated Ms. Sommerville's rights to be free both from \nemployment discrimination and discrimination in her use of a public accommodation. \nII.  Nova is Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nTo establish a likelihood of success, Nova \"need only raise a fair question regarding the \nexistence of a claimed right and a fair question that [she] will be entitled to the relief prayed for if \nthe proof sustains the allegations.\" Kalbfleisch, 3 96 Ill. App. 3d at 1114; see also Seyller v. Cnty. \n2 Several courts and administrative agencies have found that denying a transgender student use of \ngender-segregated facilities (e.g., restrooms and locker rooms) that matches their gender identity \nconstitutes unlawful discrimination. The Seventh Circuit recently affirmed a Wisconsin district \ncourt's preliminary injunction barring a school from violating Title IX and the Equal Protection \nClause by denying a boy use of the boys' restroom, because he is transgender.  Whitaker by \nWhitaker v.  Kenosha  Unified Sch.  Dist.  No.  1 Bd.  of Educ.,  858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir.  2017). \nSimilarly, a federal court in Ohio entered a preliminary injunction ordering a school to allow a \ntransgender girl to use the girls' restrooms in reliance on Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. \nBd. ofE duc. oft he Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep't ofE  duc., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850 \n(S.D. Ohio 2016). Also, the Colorado Division of Civil Rights concluded that a Colorado school \nviolated Colorado law by refusing to allow a transgender girl to use the girls' restrooms at her \nschool. Coy Mathis v. Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, Charge No. P20130034X (Colo. \nDiv. of Civil Rights June 17, 2013), available online at http://www.transgenderlegal.org/media/ \nuploads/doc  529.pdf. \n9 \nA056\n\nof Kane, 408 Ill. App. 3d 982, 991  (2d Dist. 2011) (providing the same standard); Fischer v. \nBrombolich, 207 Ill. App. 3d 1053, 1066 (5th Dist. 1991) (same). Nova easily meets that standard \nregarding the existence of her right to use the girls' locker room and the remedy of requiring \nDistrict 211 to allow her to use the locker room. \nNova has raised a fair question regarding the existence of her right not to be denied use of \nthe girls' locker room at school. The IHRA explicitly prohibits discrimination based on one's \ngender identity. See Argument, Section I, supra.  There are no exceptions to this prohibition. \nAlthough the IHRA permits public accommodations to maintain separate facilities for males and \nfemales, 775 ILCS 5/5-103(B), District 211 may not deny Nova, a female, use of the facilities \nreserved for females because she is transgender. See Ex. E, Sommerville, ALS No.  13-0060C \n(Although the IHRA permits public accommodations to segregate by sex facilities like locker room \nand restrooms, \"sex\" means the \"status of being male or female\" and is determined based on an \nindividual's gender identity.\") On similar facts, the Maine Supreme Court held that denying a \ntransgender girl use of the girls' restrooms and forcing her to use an individual restroom violated \nthe Maine Human Rights Act's prohibition against gender identity discrimination. Doe v. Reg'/ \nSch.  Unit 26, 86 A.3d 600, 606 (2014). As is true here, the school district violated state law \nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity, by treating a female student \"differently \nfrom other students solely because of her status as a trans gender girl.\" Id. \nNova has also raised a fair question that she will be entitled to the relief she seeks-the \nright to use the girls' locker room, rather than requiring her-and only her-to change in a separate \narea from other girls. \nAny concerns raised by the District regarding hypothetical privacy concerns on the part of \nnon-transgender students are not a defense to its violation of the IHRA. There is no \"privacy\" \n10 \nA057\n\nexception  to  the  IHRA's  prohibition  against  discrimination  against  transgender  students. \nMoreover, the District has offered any student who has particular privacy concerns alternative \nareas where they could dress for gym. Report and Recommendation 4, Doc. 134, Students and \nParents for Privacy v.  US Dept. ofE  d., No. 16-cv-4945, 2016 WL 6134121, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. \n18, 2016) (hereafter \"Students Recommendation\") (\"any cisgender [non-trans gender] high school \nstudent who does not want to use a restroom or locker room with a transgender student is not \nrequired to do so.\"). In addition, \"high school students do not have a constitutional right not to \nshare restrooms or locker rooms with transgender students whose sex assigned at birth is different \nthan theirs.\" Students Recommendation at *2; see also Doe by & through Doe v. Boyertown Area \nSch. Dist., CV 17-1249, 2017 WL 3675418, at *54 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 25, 2017) (same).3 \nIII.  Denying Nova The Use of The Girls' Locker Room Causes Nova Irreparable Harm \nThat Cannot Be Remedied Though An Award Of Monetary Damages. \nAn injury is irreparable if it cannot be adequately compensated by damages. Kalbfleisch, \n396 Ill. App. 3d at 1116; Cross Wood Products, Inc.  v. Suter, 97 Ill. App. 3d 282, 286 (1981). \n\"Irreparable harm\" has also been defined as an injury that is not \"beyond the possibility of repair \nor beyond the possibility of compensation in damages, but that species of injury that ought not be \nsubmitted to on the one hand or inflicted on the other.\" Cross, 97 Ill. App. 3d at 286. \nNova will continue to suffer irreparable harm if she is not allowed to use the girls' locker \nroom at school. District 211 humiliates and stigmatizes Nova by separating her from her female \npeers. She describes how the District has made her feel like an outcast who doesn't belong, isn't \naccepted as an equal member of the school, and is somehow less of a person. Maday Aff. at ,-i 16. \nThe District's message to her and the other girls in her class is that it does not consider Nova a \n3  Nor  could  those  students  allege  hostile  environment  sexual  harassment.  Students \nRecommendation, 2016 WL 6134121, at *30-35. \n11 \nA058\n\n\"real\" girl worthy of the same treatment as other girls, and that she should be ashamed of who she \nis and hidden away. Id. As a result, her self-confidence has suffered, she's experienced increased \nanxiety, and her gender dysphoria has worsened. Id. Nova's status as a senior who will soon be \nentering her last semester of high school is also significant. Unless this Court grants her the \ninjunction she requests, she will never again have the opportunity to enjoy a typical high school \nP.E. experience. See e.g. Doe v.  Wood County Bd. ofE  d., 888 F. Supp. 2d 771, 778 (S.D.W. Va. \n2012), (weighing in favor of granting the student plaintiffs' preliminary injunction the fact that \nthey \"will experience their middle school years only once during their life.\"). \nIn addition to Nova's own sworn affidavit, Dr. Randi Ettner, who is unquestionably an \nexpert on transgender issues, provides strong support for finding irreparable harm.4 She performed \na clinical assessment of Nova. Ettner Aff at ,-i 7. She concluded that telling Nova \"that she can \nonly use the girls' locker room if she is isolated from the group\" causes her anxiety and depression. \nId.  at ,-i 31. It \"signals that she is not 'truly a girl\"' and \"[t]hat message-that she is unlike her \nfemale peers-exacerbates her gender dysphoria, undermines her medically indicated treatment, \nand is extremely harmful to her psychological and emotional well-being.\" Id. Thus, there is strong \nsupport for the conclusion that Nova will suffer harm if the District continues to discriminate \nagainst her by denying her use of the girls'  locker room.  This harm  cannot adequately be \ncompensated in damages, cannot be measured by any pecuniary standard, and ought not to be \ninflicted on any young person. \n4 See Ex. C, Ettner Aff., ,-i,-i 2-6 (outlining her experience working with children and adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria, evaluating thousands of persons with gender dysphoria, consulting with \nschool systems in Chicago and Wisconsin on issues related to gender dysphoria, and publishing \nbooks regarding gender dysphoria and its treatment). \n12 \nA059\n\nThe Seventh Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Whitaker in affirming the district \ncourt's grant of a preliminary injunction because, in treating the student differently from other \nmale students by denying him use of the boys'  restroom, the school was \"significantly and \nnegatively impact[ing] his mental health and overall well-being\" by preventing an \"integral\" part \nof the student's transition so as to cause him life-long harm. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045; see also \nBd. ofE duc. oft he Highland Local Sch. Dist., 208 F. Supp. 3d at 877-78 (finding irreparable harm \ncaused by denying a transgender student the use of gender-appropriate facilities); Doe v. Regional \nSchool Unit 26,  86  A.3d 600,  607 (Me.  2014) (\"[A]  student's psychological well-being and \neducational success depend upon being permitted to use the communal bathroom consistent with \nher gender identity[.]\"). \nOther cases have also recognized the need for emergency relief in the school context to \nprevent irreparable harm to students experiencing discriminatory treatment. In Wood County Bd. \nofE  d., 888 F. Supp. 2d at 771, for example, a court found that students seeking relief from being \nrequired to attend sex-segregated schools were entitled to injunctive relief, since those students \n\"suffer from their involuntary placement in single-sex classrooms\" and \"will experience their \nmiddle school years only once during their life.\" Id.  at 778. Similarly, in Daniels v. Sch. Bd. of \nBrevard Cnty., Fla., 985 F. Supp. 1458 (M.D. Fla. 1997), the girls' softball team was entitled to \ninjunctive relief against a school to address the disparities between the girls' athletic facilities and \nboys' baseball facilities, since \"[e]ach day these inequalities go unredressed, the members of the \ngirls' softball team, prospective members, students, faculty and the community at large, are sent a \nclear message that girls' high school varsity softball is not as worthy as boys' high school varsity \nbaseball, i.e., that girls are not as important as boys.\" Id. at 1462. \n13 \nA060\n\nCONCLUSION \nNova has a clearly ascertainable right to not be discriminated against on the basis of her \ngender identity. Moreover, she will suffer irreparable harm if this Court does not compel the \nDistrict to stop treating her differently than other girls because she is transgender. Nova has raised \na fair question regarding the existence of her rights and entitlement to use the girls' locker room \nat school. Thus, a preliminary injunction is an appropriate remedy in this case. \nWHEREFORE, Nova prays that this Honorable Court grant her motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. \nDATED: December 13, 2017  Respectfully Submitted, \nr/fibJ \np~ \nBy:  f \n--==-..,--~~..;__~-A~~~ \nOne  Her Attorneys \nJohn Knight, Attorney No. 45404 \nGhirlandi Guidetti, Attorney No. 62067 \nRoger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU, Inc. \n150 N.

I am the plaintiff in this matter. I have been a student at Palatine High School, which\nis operated by defendant Township High School District 211 (the “District”), since the ninth \ngrade (fall 2014). My 18th birthday was on September 23, 2017, and I am currently in the twelfth \ngrade. I expect to graduate from Palatine High School this spring.  \n2. Outside of my school work, I spend my time working on art projects. I love\nphotography, and also enjoy computer programming and astronomy. \n3. I do well in school. I complete my course work, participate in class, and maintain\na good academic record. I also have a close group of friends who accept and respect me. \n1 \nA064\n\n4. I am transgender, which means that my female gender identity does not match the\nmale designation that I was given at birth. I have known since I was very young that I am female, \nand I have lived and presented myself as female in all aspects of my life since October 2014. \n5. I first told my family that I was a girl on March 29, 2014, before my freshman\nyear at Palatine High School. I was fourteen years old. I told them because I had been suffering \nfrom depression and anxiety, because I was expected to live as a male but I knew that I am a girl. \nI would stay in my room all of the time, because I did not want to see friends and other people \nwho would see me as a boy. I even avoided mirrors and photographs, because I did not want to \nsee images of myself as a boy. I decided that I simply could not go on living that way. \n6. After that, my family and I sought medical treatment, and I was diagnosed with\ngender dysphoria. I have received treatment for my gender dysphoria since then, including \nfeminizing hormones which I started taking in October of 2016. \n7. Since I “came out” as a girl before I started high school, I grew out my hair, and\nstarted dressing and grooming myself like other girls my age prior to starting high school. I \nstarted using “Nova” instead of the traditionally male name I was given at birth, and using \nfemale restrooms in public places. I have also used the girls’ restrooms at school since May \n2016. \n8. My teachers and peers at school have referred to me as “Nova” and have used\nfemale pronouns to refer to me since October of 2014. My school records and I.D. card both \nrefer to me as “Nova”, and list me as female. I am also in the process of legally changing my \nname to Nova Maday, which should be completed by January 2018.   \n9. In May of 2015, I met with, Katie Sobol, a school guidance counselor, to discuss\nwhether I could use the girls’ locker room to change for my physical education (“P.E.”) class. \n2 \nA065\n\nMs. Sobol told me that I could not use the girls’ locker room.  I then spoke with Fred Rasmussen, \nthe Director of Student Services, who confirmed that I could not use the girls’ locker room. \n10. In June of 2015, at the end of my freshman year, my mother told me that she had\nspoken with Ms. Sobol about my transition, and which locker room I would use to change for \nP.E. in the fall of 2015. My mother told me that Ms. Sobol had offered to allow me to use the \nprivate restroom in the nurse’s office to change for P.E. class. I agreed to use this private \nrestroom to dress separately from the other girls only because the school administration had told \nme I could not use the girls’ locker room. Later, I was told that I could use a single-user locker \nroom that would remain locked until I requested that school staff let me in before and after P.E. \n11. Once my sophomore year started in the fall of 2015, I began to experience\nanxiety, depression, and worsening of my feelings of gender dysphoria because I had to dress \nseparately from all the other girls for my P.E. class. I was frequently late for class, and my P.E. \ngrade rapidly declined. \n12. During my sophomore year, my mother and I repeatedly renewed my request to\nthe school administration that I be allowed to use the girls’ locker room. The answer was always \nthe same – “No.” So when the District offered me a waiver from P.E. class for my junior year in \nAugust 2016, I felt that I had no other choice but to accept. The alternative – not being able to \nchange in the girls’ locker room, and being treated differently from the other girls in school – just \nmade me feel too bad to continue taking P.E. \n13. In July 2017, before my senior year, the District made a new offer to me\nregarding locker room usage. I could use the girls’ locker room to change for P.E. but I would be \nrequired to dress in a private area in the locker room, away from the other girls.  \n3 \nA066\n\n14. I refused that offer because the District does not require non-transgender girls to\ndress in a separate area in the locker room. Singling me out for different treatment, and requiring \nme to dress where other girls could not see me, would isolate me from the other girls, and would \nsend both them and me the message that because I am transgender, I am not really a girl, and \nshould be ashamed of who I am and of my body. I would like to take P.E. class like every other \ngirl, but because the District would not agree to let me use the locker room like the other girls do, \nI agreed to accept a waiver from the P.E. requirement for my senior year. \n15. Like many girls, both transgender and non-transgender, I am modest about my\nbody, and do not like to be viewed while changing my clothes. If I were allowed to use the girls’ \nlocker room without being required to use a private changing area, I would change my clothes \ndiscretely, and avoid looking at other girls while they change. Also, I have no intention of letting \nother girls see me completely unclothed. As I understand that most girls at my school do, I would \nchange into gym shorts and a t-shirt for P.E. without fully undressing, would wrap myself in a \ntowel to protect my modesty, and would not shower after P.E. after exercising.  \n16. By not letting me use the locker room to change for P.E. like other girls, Palatine\nHigh School has made me feel like an outcast who doesn’t belong, who isn’t accepted as an \nequal member of the school, and who is somehow less of a person than non-transgender students. \nThe school’s message to me is that I am not a “real” girl worthy of the same treatment as other \ngirls, and that I should be ashamed of who I am and hidden away. As a result, my self-\nconfidence has suffered, I have experienced increased anxiety, and my gender dysphoria has \ngotten worse. I just want to be treated like the other girls in my school before I graduate this \nspring. \n4 \nA067\n\nFURTHER AFFIANT SA VETH NOT \niL \nDated: December  2017 \nNova Maday \n5 \nA068\n\nExhibit B\nA069\n\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLLNOIS \nCOUNTY DEPARTMENT, CHANCERY DIVISION \nNOVA MADAY,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  )  Case No. 17 CH 15791 \n) \nv.  )  Hon.

Nova Maday, the plaintiff in this matter, is my daughter. \n2.  She is currently eighteen years old and is a senior at Palatine High School  in \nTownship High School District 211 (the \"District\"). \n3.  When Nova was born, she was assigned the male gender. \n4.  On or about March 29, 2014, Nova told me that she identifies as female, and I \nhave come to understand that she is actually female even though she was assigned the male \ngender at birth. \n5.  After I  learned that my child is a girl, I did everything I could to support and \naffirm her, including by helping her to transition to live as a girl. \nA070\n\n6.  Nova has lived exclusively as a girl  outside of school since September 2014, \nincluding in the way she dresses and grooms herself. \n7.  Nova has presented herself fully as a girl at school since October 2014. \n8.  As part of my efforts to support my daughter's transition to living as a girl, I \nrepeatedly requested that officials at her school and from the District allow her to use the girls' \nlocker room to change for her gym class. \n9.  The first time I requested that Nova be allowed to use the girls' locker room was \nin June 2015. \n10.  School and District officials repeatedly told me Nova would not be allowed to \nchange in the girls' locker room. \n11.  Earlier this year, the school and District modified their position. During a meeting \non July 24, 2017, Mark Kovak, the District's Associate Superintendent for Student Services, said \nthat the district would allow Nova to use the girls' locker room, but only if Nova promised to use \na privacy area in the locker room while she changed that would shield her from the view of other \ngirls in the locker room. Mr. Kovak explained that other students are also able to use the privacy \nareas. I pointed out that while other students may be allowed to use the privacy areas, none of \nthem are required to use them. Mr. Kovak confirmed this was correct. I then explained that this \ndifferential treatment of Nova made the District's offer unacceptable. By making Nova change in \na privacy area, whether she wanted to or not, the District was isolating my daughter from the \nother girls, and signaling to her that there was something wrong with her, and that she was less \nworthy of using the locker room than other girls. It was humiliating for Nova. \n12.  Because the District refused to allow Nova to use the girls' locker room unless \nshe agreed to change in a privacy area, a precondition not expected of other girls, Nova and I \n2 \nA071\n\nrefused the District's offer, and instead accepted a waiver of the requirement that Nova take a \nphysical education class. \nFURTHER AFFIANT SA YETH NOT \n3 \nA072\n\nExhibit C\nA073\n\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS \nCOUNTY DEPARTMENT, CHANCERY DIVISION \nNOVA MADAY,  ) \n      ) \nPlaintiff,    )  Case No. 17 CH 15791 \n) \nv.  )  Hon.

I have been retained by counsel as an expert in connection with the above-\ncaptioned litigation.  I have actual knowledge of the matters stated in this declaration. The \npurpose of this declaration is to offer my opinions regarding (i) the scientific information about \nthe medical condition known as gender dysphoria; (ii) to describe the psychological harm that \narises when a transgender girl is treated unlike her female peers; and (iii) to offer my assessment \nof Nova Maday’s gender dysphoria diagnosis and the negative psychological impact she \nexperiences as a result of being told she would be segregated from the other girls within the \nlocker room.  \n2. My professional background, experience, and publications are detailed in my\ncurriculum vitae, a true and accurate copy is attached. I received my doctorate in psychology \nA074\n\nfrom Northwestern University in 1979.  I was the chief psychologist at the Chicago Gender \nCenter, a position I have held since 2005, and am now the psychologist at the Weiss Memorial \nHospital Gender Confirmation Center. \n3. I have expertise working with children, adolescents, and adults with gender\ndysphoria.  I have been involved in the treatment of gender dysphoric individuals since 1977, \nwhen I was an intern at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, and in the course of my career, I have \nevaluated and/or treated 3,000 individuals with gender dysphoria and mental health issues related \nto gender variance.   \n4. I have served as a consultant to multiple school districts in the state of Wisconsin,\nas well as the Chicago public school system on issues related to gender identity.  I was selected \nas the named honoree of an externally-funded fellowship in recognition of my achievements in \nthe field of transgender health—the University of Minnesota Randi and Fred Ettner Fellowship \nin Transgender Health—and have been an invited guest at the National Institute of Health to \nparticipate in developing a strategic plan to advance the health of sexual and gender minorities. \n5. I have published four books, including the medical text entitled “Principles of\nTransgender Medicine and Surgery” (co-editors Monstrey & Eyler; Routledge, 2007) and its 2nd \nedition (co-editors Monstrey & Coleman, 2016), and give grand rounds at university hospitals.  I \nhave authored numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals regarding the provision of health care \nto this population.  I have served as a member of the University of Chicago Gender Board and \nam a member of the editorial boards for the International Journal of Transgenderism and \nTransgender Health. \n6. I am the Secretary of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health\n(“WPATH”) (formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association), and an \n2 \nA075\n\nauthor of the WPATH Standards of Care (7th version), published in 2011.  The WPATH-\npromulgated Standards of Care are the internationally recognized guidelines for the treatment of \npersons with gender dysphoria and serve to inform medical treatment in the United States and \nthroughout the world. \n7. In preparing this declaration, I have relied upon my years of clinical and research\nexperience, the research that relates to my opinions cited, my assessment of Nova Maday and the \npsychodiagnostic testing I performed. \nGENDER IDENTITY AND GENDER DYSPHORIA \n8. The term “gender identity” is a well-established concept in medicine, referring to\none’s sense of oneself as belonging to a particular gender.  All human beings develop this \nelemental internal view: the conviction of belonging to a particular gender, such as male or \nfemale.  Gender identity is firmly established early in life. \n9. At birth, infants are classified as male or female. This classification becomes the\nperson’s birth-assigned gender. Typically, persons assigned male at birth identify as males.  \nHowever, for transgender individuals, this is not the case.  For transgender individuals, the sense \nof one’s self—one’s gender identity—differs from the birth-assigned gender, giving rise to a \nsense of being “wrongly embodied.”  \n10. Scientific research strongly suggests that gender identity has a biological\ncomponent, and is not the result of social, cultural or environmental influences. \n11. Attempts to change an individual’s gender identity to match their birth-assigned\ngender are ineffective, and cause extreme psychological damage. Such efforts are considered \nunethical. \n3 \nA076\n\n12. The medical diagnosis for the feeling of incongruence and accompanying distress\ndescribed above is gender dysphoria, which is codified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \nof Mental Disorders (DSM-V) (American Psychiatric Association) and the International \nClassification of Diseases-10 (World Health Organization).  The condition is manifested by \nsymptoms such as preoccupation with ridding oneself of the primary and/or secondary sex \ncharacteristics associated with one’s birth-assigned gender.  Untreated gender dysphoria can \nresult in significant clinical distress, debilitating depression, and often, suicidality.  \n13. The criteria for establishing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria in adolescents and\nadults are set forth in the DSM-V (302.85): \nA.  A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and \nassigned gender, of at least 6 months duration, as manifested by at least two of \nthe following: \n1. A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed\ngender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in\nyoung adolescents, the anticipated sex characteristics).\n2. A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary/and or secondary sex\ncharacteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s\nexperienced/ expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to\nprevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex\ncharacteristics).\n3. A strong desire for the primary and /or secondary sex\ncharacteristics of the other gender.\n4. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative\ngender different from one’s assigned gender).\n5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some\nalternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).\n6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions\nof the other gender (or some alternative gender different from\none’s assigned gender).\n4 \nA077\n\nB.  The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment \nin social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. \n14. WPATH has established internationally accepted Standards of Care (“SOC”) for\nthe treatment of people with gender dysphoria.  The SOC have been endorsed as the authoritative \nstandards of care by leading medical and mental health organizations, including the American \nMedical Association, the Endocrine Society, the American Psychiatric Association, the \nAmerican Psychological Association, the World Health Organization, the American Academy of \nFamily Physicians, the National Commission of Correctional Health Care, the American Public \nHealth Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American College of \nObstetrics and Gynecology and The American Society of Plastic Surgeons. \n15. In accordance with the SOC, transgender individuals undergo medically-\nnecessary transition in order to live in alignment with their gender identity.  For an adolescent \nwith gender dysphoria, medical treatment typically consists of social role transition, and may \ninclude cross-sex hormone therapy. \n16. The SOC identify the following evidence-based protocols for the treatment of\nindividuals with gender dysphoria: \n(cid:120)  Changes in gender expression and role, consistent with one’s gender identity \n(also referred to as social role transition). \n(cid:120)  Psychotherapy for purposes such as addressing the negative impact of stigma, \nalleviating internalized transphobia, enhancing social and peer support, \nimproving body image, promoting resiliency, etc.  \n(cid:120)  Hormone therapy to feminize or masculinize the body. (cid:850) \n(cid:120)  Surgery to alter primary and/or secondary sex characteristics. \n17. Like protocols for the treatment of other medical conditions, once a diagnosis is\nestablished, a treatment plan is developed based on an individualized assessment of the medical \nneeds of the patient.  Some combination of social role transition, hormone therapy, \n5 \nA078\n\npsychotherapy, and surgery is used to help the individual patient with gender dysphoria live \ncongruently and eliminate the clinically significant distress caused by the condition. \n18. Changes in gender presentation and role to feminize appearance—social role\ntransition—are an important component of treatment. This requires dressing, grooming, and \notherwise outwardly presenting oneself consistently through social signifiers that correspond to \none’s gender identity in every aspect of life—at home, school, and in the broader community. \nThis is an appropriate prerequisite of identity consolidation.   \n19. Hormone treatment will result in the acquisition of secondary sex characteristics,\n(eg. breast development, a softening of facial skin, and a redistribution of body fat) inducing an \nauthentic female appearance that aligns with the gender identity. \n20. Although children who are transgender feel “different” and may be confused\nabout the suitability of their assigned gender, they often abide anxiety until they are older, and \nlearn that there is a name for their experience—“transgender”—and a diagnosis—gender \ndysphoria.  For some, this happens in adolescence, or even adulthood.  Then, a sequential \ninternal and external process ensues: accepting and identifying as transgender, explaining to \nfamily and others about the necessity of transition, dis-identifying with the assigned gender and \nseeking support for post-transition life. The final stage—identity consolidation—is attained when \nthe transgender aspect of life becomes less important, and the individual refocuses on the normal \nchallenges of life. With identity consolidation, the shame of having lived as a “false self” and the \ngrief of being born into the “wrong body” can be ameliorated. If any aspect of this social \ntransition is impeded however, it can destabilize the patient and undermine the treatment goals. \n6 \nA079\n\nHARMFUL EFFECTS OF EXCLUSION  \nFROM GENDER-APPROPRIATE FACILITIES \n21. Social transition is a critical part of treatment for transgender individuals and it is\nimportant that the social transition occur in all aspects of the individual’s life.  For a gender \ndysphoric adolescent to be considered female in one situation, for example, but not in another is \ninconsistent with evidence-based medical practice and detrimental to the health and well-being \nof the individual, regardless of age.  The integration of a consolidated identity into the daily \nactivities of life is the aim of treatment.  Thus, it is critical that the social transition be complete \nand unqualified—including with respect to the use of locker rooms and other spaces and \nactivities separated by gender.  \n22. Use of the locker rooms and facilities available to others is an undeniable\nnecessity for transgender individuals. Locker rooms, unlike other settings (e.g., the library), \ncategorize people according to gender.  When it comes to gender-specific locker rooms, there are \ngenerally two, and only two, such categories designated: male and female.  To deny a \ntransgender individual use of a facility consistent with that person’s gender identity, or to insist \nthat a transgender individual use a separate, private area, communicates that such a person is not \na “real girl”; or that the person is some undifferentiated “other.”  Such segregation and \nidentification of the individual as “other” interferes with the person’s ability to consolidate \nidentity and undermines the social-transition process.  \n23. Separating a transgender girl from other girls in the locker room causes school to\nbecome a source of anxiety and humiliation. This division from peers, and the distress that arises \nfrom the discrimination make it difficult to concentrate at school. Transgender people go to great \nlengths to transition from their assigned birth gender. Segregating these individuals from spaces \nwith peers can be deeply traumatic, particularly for adolescents, and exacerbates the depression, \n7 \nA080\n\nanxiety and isolation that many transgender youngsters experience.  Indeed, research shows that \nusage of the same facilities available to others is an undeniable necessity for transgender \nindividuals.  \n24. Sending the message that a person is different from peers, and needs to be\nsegregated, triggers shame.  External attempts to negate a person’s gender identity constitute \nidentity threat.  Developing and integrating a positive sense of self-identity formation is a \ndevelopmental task for all human beings.  For the transgender individual, the process is more \ncomplex, as the “self” violates society’s norms and expectations.  Attempts to negate a person’s \nidentity—such as closeting an adolescent girl within a locker room of her female peers—\nchallenges the legitimacy of identity, erodes resilience and poses health risks, including anxiety, \ndepression, and other psychological harms. In a study of transgender youth age 15 to 21, \ninvestigators found school to be the most traumatic aspect of growing up.  Experiences of \nrejection and discrimination led to feelings of shame and unworthiness.   \n25. Until recently, it was not fully understood that these experiences of shame and\ndiscrimination could have serious and enduring consequences.  But it is now known that \nstigmatization and victimization are some of the most powerful predictors of current and future \nmental health problems, including the development of psychiatric disorders.  The social \nproblems that transgender teens face at school actually create the blueprint for future mental \nhealth, life satisfaction, and physical health. \nNOVA MADAY \n26. Nova was very young when she identified with females on television and believed\nshe should be a girl. She recalls taking her blanket and wrapping herself in it, attempting to \nfashion a dress for herself. As a youngster, she knew she was “different.” She preferred the \n8 \nA081\n\ncompany of girls, but spent most of her childhood alone. Nova had few friends, and was bullied \nat school and taunted for being “gay.” Grade school was difficult and lonely for Nova, and her \nacademic performance reflected her unhappiness.  \n27. When Nova was eleven years old, she searched Google: “how to tell my mother I\nwant to be a girl.” That search led to information about gender dysphoria and the relief of \nknowing that “I wasn’t the only person who felt this sort of thing.” Still, it was two more years \nbefore Nova worked up the courage to tell her mother about her gender incongruity. Fortunately, \nNova’s mother was extremely supportive and sought medical care. Nova was diagnosed with \ngender dysphoria and is receiving the appropriate and medically—indicated hormonal therapy. \nShe is now in the process of obtaining a legal name change. Despite her successful transition, the \nmandate to remain apart from the other girls in the locker room, is a constant source of anguish \nfor Nova, triggering anxiety and depression.  \n28. Nova Maday has been accurately diagnosed with early onset, severe Gender\nDysphoria in adolescents and adults (302.85). She is a senior in high school but does not \nparticipate in gym class, because she is not allowed to use the girls’ locker room, unless she \nsegregates herself in a private area. The shame of being singled out, separated from the group, \nand stigmatized is a devastating blow to Nova, who wants nothing more than to be treated “like \neveryone else—like the other girls.”  \n29. Preadolescence marks the beginning of the importance of the peer group. By\nadolescence, the authority of the peer group is at its apex. Personality theorists consider peer \ninteraction to be the single most powerful driver of human behavior. “Fitting in’ is the \noverarching motivation at this stage of life.

PRIMA FACIE ALLEGATIONS \n1.  N .S. is a transgender girl whose gender-related identity is female. \n2.  Respondent District 211 is a place of public accommodation as defined by \nthe Illinois Human Rights Act. \n3.  Respondent has been aware ofN.S.'s gender-related identity, female, at \nleast since January 2015. \n4.  N.S. is currently a junior (eleventh grade) at Palatine High School in District \n211 for the 2016-2017 school year. In all aspects of her life, she lives and \npresents as female.  District 211 uses her female name and female pronouns \nwhen referring to her. It also allows her to dress in female clothing and use \nthe girls' restroom. However, District 211 has denied N.S. full and equal \nenjoyment of its facilities by requiring her to change in a restroom in the \nnurse's office or a separate single-user locker room instead of the girls' \nlocker room. \n5.  N.S. and her mother first discussed where, now that she is presenting as \nfemale, she would change for gym class on May 1, 2015 during a meeting \nwith Kathleen \"Katie\" Sobol, a student counselor at Palatine High School. \nSince that meeting, N.S. and her mother have had several meetings, phone \ncalls, and email exchanges regarding locker room access with District 211 \nrepresentatives. Those representatives include Frank Rasmussen, Palatine \nHigh School's Director of Student Services; Mark Kovack, District 211 's \nAssociate Superintendent for Student Services, Gary Steiger, Palatine High \nSchool's Principal and Daniel E. Cates, District 211 's Superintendent-Elect. \n6.  District 211 treats N.S. differently than non-transgender female students at \nDistrict 211, because it denies her the use of the girls' locker room since her \ngender-related identity, female, fails to match her sex assigned at birth. \n7.  District 211 's refusal to allow N .S. to use the girls' locker room is damaging \nto her health and wellbeing, because the District denies her the ability to \nlive  her  life  in  complete  conformity  with  her  gender.  isolates  and \nstigmatizes her by treating her differently from other girls. \n1 \nA087\n\nIn the Matter of Brenda \nSchweda on behalf ofN.S., a \nminor \n11.

N.S. has been diagnosed with gender \ndysphoria by medical experts in that field. \n2.  N.S.  is  a qualified  individual  who  has  fulfilled  all  non-discriminatory \nrequirements for full and equal use of the facilities and services at District \n211, including the locker room that matches her gender identity. \n3.  Respondent District 211 is a place of public accommodation as defined by \nthe Illinois Human Rights Act. \n4.  District 211 has been aware of N.S. 's disability at least since January 2015. \n5.  N.S. is a junior (eleventh grade} at Palatine High School in District 211 \nduring the 2016-2017 school year. District 211 denies N .S. full and equal \nuse of the locker room at school that matches her gender identity, because \nof N.S. 's disability. Instead, because of her disability, District 211 requires \nher to change in the restroom in the nurse's office or a separate single-user \nlocker room, when girls who do not have gender dysphoria are allowed to \nchange in the girls' locker room. \n111.  A.  ISSUE/BASIS \nJune 2015 to Present - Respondent Township High School District 211  (\"District 211\") \ndenied N.S. a reasonable accommodation for her disability, gender dysphoria, when it \ndenied her full and equal use of the girls' locker room. \nB.

Respondent District 211 is a place of public accommodation as defined by \nthe Illinois Human Rights Act. \n4.  District 211 has been aware of N.S. 's disability at least since January 2015. \n5.  N.S. is a junior (eleventh grade)  at Palatine High School in District 211 \nduring the 2016-2017 school year. \n6.  N.S.  and her mother requested a reasonable accommodation for  N.S.'s \ngender dysphoria, namely that she be given the same access to the girls' \nlocker room at school as other girls. Having the same access to the girls' \nlocker room as other girls is a reasonable accommodation  because the \nrecommended medical treatment for many people diagnosed with gender \ndysphoria, including N.S .. is living in complete conformity with the gender \nwith which they identify. \n6.  District 211 denied N.S. and her mother's request that N.S. be allowed to \nuse the girl' locker room like other girls.

The Illinois Department of Human Rights filed an opposition \nbrief to Respondent's motion.  The matter is ready for decision. \nThe Department is an additional statutory agency that has issued state actions in this \nmatter.  Therefore, the Department is an additional party of record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe following material facts were derived from uncontested sections of the record.  The \nfindings did not require, and were not the result of, credibility determinations. \n1.  On February 28, 2013, Complainant, Meggan Sommerville, filed two separate \ncomplaints with the Illinois Human Rights Commission against Respondent, Hobby Lobby \nStores. One complaint cited Article 2 of the Illinois Human Rights Act, employment, and the \nsecond, Article 5, public accommodation.  Both complaints named sexual orientation \ndiscrimination, related to gender identity, as the protected class.  The cases were consolidated \non May 23, 2013. \n2.  In July 1998, Respondent hired Complainant as an employee.  In 2000, \nComplainant was transferred to Respondent's East Aurora store, No. 237. \n1 \nA092\n\n3.  Complainant was present on Respondent's premises both as an employee and \nas a customer.  The general public and employees utilize the store's restrooms, which are \ndesignated by gender. \n4.  Since 2007, Complainant implemented a procedure toward transitioning from \nmale to female.  In 2009, Complainant had medical treatment from health care providers and \nother services at Howard Brown Health Center, which resulted in female secondary sex \ncharacteristics, including breasts and absence of facial hair. \n5.  Complainant is a transsexual who presents and identifies as female. \n6.  In February 2010, Complainant removed the male name from her employee \nnametag, without objection from Respondent, as not to confuse the customers with the \nnoticeable physical manifestations of the transition. \n7.  On July 9, 2010, Complainant formally informed Respondent through Edward \nSlavin, store manager, of her male to female transition and her intent to use the women's \nrestroom. \n8.  Respondent changed Complainant's personnel records and benefits information \nto identify her as female.  Complainant appears at work in feminine dress and make-up. \nEmployees and employers refer to Complainant by her chosen female name. \n9.  However, Respondent did not consent to Complainant's use of the store's \ndesignated women's restroom, until Complainant produced legal authority mandating its use to \nher. \n10.  On July 12, 2010, Complainant had her name legally changed to \"Meggan Renee \nSommerville,\" by order of the Circuit Court of Kendall County, Illinois. \n11.  On July 29, 2010, the State of Illinois issued its driver's license identifying \nComplainant as female. \n12.  In July 2010, Complainant obtained a new social security card with her female \nname. \n2 \nA093\n\n13.  In July 2010, Complainant produced to Anna Lee Miller, Respondent's Human \nResources Specialist, a copy of the Illinois Human Rights Act, related statutes from Iowa and \nColorado, a copy of her revised Illinois driver's license, her social security card, and her court \nordered name change.  The material submitted also included a letter dated July 21, 2015, from \nKristin Koglovitz, Clinic Director of Howard Brown Health Center, who identified and verified \nComplainant as a female transgender individual, described the transition process, and \nadvocated Complainant's use of the women's restroom at Respondent's store. \n14.  On July 30, 2010, Miller instructed Complainant to communicate with \nRespondent's legal office and, despite the information submitted, she was not permitted to use \nthe women's restroom. \n15.  Complainant used the women's facilities at nearby businesses. \n16.  On February 23, 2011, Complainant was given a written warning for entering \nRespondent's women's restroom. \n17.  During the course of litigation, Respondent changed its precondition for the use \nof the women's facilities from producing legal authority to surgery.  In 2014, Respondent \nmodified its condition option to changing her birth certificate. \n18.  In December 2013 or January 2014, Respondent had built a \"unisex\" restroom \nfor Complainant's use. \n1g .  As of this Recommended Liability Determination, Complainant is still not \npermitted to use Respondent's women's restroom facilities as an employee or customer. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1.  The Commission has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. \n2.  Complainant established direct evidence of sexual related identity discrimination \nby Respondent preventing Complainant's access and use of the women's restroom at \nRespondent's store. \n3 \nA094\n\nDISCUSSION \nSUMMARY DECISION STANDARD \nUnder section 8-106.1 of the Human Rights Act, either party to a complaint may move \nfor summary decision.  775 ILCS 5/8-106.1.  A summary decision is analogous to a summary \njudgment in the Circuit Courts.  Cano v. Village of Dolton, 250 lll.App.3d 130, 138, 620 N.E.2d \n1200, 1206 (1st Dist. 1993). \nA motion for summary decision should be granted when there is no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to a recommended order in its favor as a matter of \nlaw.  Fitzpatrick v. Human Rights Comm'n, 267 111.App.3d 386, 391, 642 N.E.2d 486, 490 (4th \nDist. 1994).  All pleadings, affidavits, interrogatories, and admissions must be strictly construed \nagainst the movant and liberally construed in favor of the non-moving party.  Kolakowski v. \nVoris, 76 lll.App.3d 453, 456-57, 395 N.E.2d 6, 9 (1st Dist.1979).  Although not required to \nprove her case as if at a hearing, the non-moving party must provide some factual basis for \ndenying the motion.  Sirek v. City of Quincy, 241 lll.App.3d 119, 121, 608 N.E.2d 920, 922 (4th \nDist. 1993).  Only facts supported by evidence, and not mere conclusions of law, should be \nconsidered.  Chevrie v. Gruesen, 208 111.App.3d 881, 883-84, 567 N.E.2d 629, 630-31 (2d Dist. \n1991 ).  If a respondent supplies sworn facts that, if uncontroverted, warrant judgment in its favor \nas a matter of law, a complainant may not rest on her pleadings to create a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.  Fitzpatrick, 267 lll.App.3d at 392, 642 N.E.2d at 490.  Where the party's affidavits \nstand uncontroverted, the facts contained therein must be accepted as true and, therefore, a \nparty's failure to file counter-affidavits in response is frequently fatal to her case.  Rotzoll v. \nOverhead Door Corp., 289 lll.App.3d 410, 418, 681N.E.2d156, 161 (4th Dist.1997).  Inasmuch \nas summary decision is a drastic means for resolving litigation, the movant's right to a summary \ndecision must be clear and free from doubt.  Purtill v. Hess, 111 lll.2d 229, 240 (1986). \n4 \nA095\n\nSummary of Issues \nComplainant is a transsexual, who presents and identifies as female, was and is denied \naccess to Respondent's women's restroom at its store, both in her capacity as an employee and \na customer.  Complainant alleges such disparate treatment is contrary to the Act in terms and \nconditions of Complainant's employment and a denial of the full and equal enjoyment of a public \naccommodation. \nRespondent contends the Act does not require it as an employer or as a public \naccommodation to permit Complainant, a transgender person, to use its store's restroom other \nthan the one designated for her birth gender, male, or until she undergoes anatomical surgery. \nAct's Interpretation \n'The Illinois Human Rights Act is remedial legislation that must be construed liberally to \neffectuate its purpose.\" Nuraoka v. Illinois Human Rights Commission, 252 lll.App.3d 1039, 625 \nN.E.2d 251 (151 Dist. 1993) citing, Nielsen Co. v. Public Building Commission of Chicago, 81 \nlll.2d 290, 410 N.E.2d 40 (1980). \nA primary rule of statutory construction is to give effect to the words selected by the \nGeneral Assembly and its intent.  \"No word or paragraph should be interpreted so as to be \nrendered meaningless.\"  Boaden v. Illinois Department of Law Enforcement, 171 lll.2d 230, 664 \nN.E.2d 61 (1996); Sangamon County Sheriffs Department v. Illinois Human Rights Commission \net al., 233 lll.2d 125, 908 N.E.2d 39, (2009), citing Wade v. Citv of North Chicago Police \nPension Board, 226 lll.2d 485, 877 N.E2d 1011 (2008).  The best indication of the legislature's \nintent is the language of the statute, which must be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Id., \nciting Cinkus v. Village of Stickney Municipal Officers Electoral Board, 228 lll.2d 200, 886 \nN.E.2d 1011 (2008). \nDiscrimination Defined \nSection 1-102(A) of the Act provides that it is the \"public policy\" of this State to \"secure \nfor all individuals within Illinois the freedom from discrimination against any individual because \n5 \nA096\n\nof his or her race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, \nmarital status, physical or mental disability, military status, sexual orientation, or unfavorable \ndischarge from military service in connection with employment, real estate transactions, access \nto financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.\" (Emphasis added.)  1 \nSection 1-103 (0-1) of the Act defines \"sexual orientation,\" in pertinent part, as \"gender \nrelated identity, whether or not traditionally associated with the person's designated sex at \nbirth.\" \nSection 2-102(A) of the Act provides it is a \"civil rights violation\" for \"any employer ... to \nsegregate ... discipline ... terms, privileges or conditions of employment on the basis of unlawful \ndiscrimination ... \" \nSection 5-102 (A) of the Act provides it is a \"civil rights violation\" to \"deny or refuse to \nanother the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities ... and services of any public place of \naccommodation.\" \nStatutory Interpretation \nArticle 2, Employment \nRespondent's first statutory argument is that the Act does not address whether a \ntransgender employee has the right to use a restroom other than the restroom associated with \nthe person's sex at birth, \"thus, leaving the matter to the employers' discretion.\" 2 \nThe opposite is correct; Article 2, employment, is meant to be broad with noted \nexceptions, which does not exclude the use of restrooms by transsexuals. \nRespondent has not revealed any pertinent limitations of Section 2-102(A), Civil Rights \nViolations relating to Section 1-102(A), Freedom from Unlawful Discrimination or Section 1-103 \n(0-1 ), Sexual Orientation, in which sexual related identity is part.  As read, sexual related \nAll of the statutory classes were purposely cited, as each are equally protected and \nenforced under the Act. \n2  Respondent cites an Article 5, Public Accommodation, clauses, Section 5/5-102(A) and \n5/5-103(8) for its Article 2, Employment, argument; this statutory authority is misplaced. \n6 \nA097\n\nidentity is protected against all statutory employment civil rights violations, \"whether or not \ntraditionally associated with the person's designated sex at birth.\" Id. \nThere is no special treatment based on sexual orientation here, only the basic treatment \nof any employee.  Section 1-101.1 of the Act.  The basic right to use a restroom, as a term and \ncondition of employment, is discussed below. \nSignificantly, Respondent failed to note that if the legislature wished to limit Article 2, it \nwould have done so under Section 2-104, Exemptions.  (Emphasis added.)  It did not. \nTherefore, an employee's rights under sexual orientation, including sexual related \nidentity, is broadly interpreted and protected against all listed civil rights violations.  Id. \nArticle 5 - Public Accommodations \nComplainant averred that she was both an employee and customer of Respondent, and \nthat the women's restroom was available to the general public.  Respondent does not counter \nComplainants allegations, and they are accepted as true.  Rotzoll, supra. \nThe interpretation of Article Five is limited to the facts of this case, and the issue before \nme. \nArticle 1, General Provisions and Definitions, relate to the entire Act.  Thus, Section 1-\n102 (A), Freedom from Unlawful Discrimination; Section 1-103 (D). Civil Rights Violations; \nSection 1-103 (0), Sex; and Section 1-103 (0-1) Sexual Orientation, are pertinent to Article 5, \nPublic Accommodation. \nIt has been established that Respondent is a statutory public accommodation and that it \ncannot \"deny or refuse to another (customer) the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities, goods \nand services of any public place of accommodation.\"  Section 5-102 (A) Enjoyment of Facilities, \nGoods and Services. \nHowever, Section 5-103 (B ), Facilities Distinctly Private, sets out an exemption to an \nArticle 5 civil rights violation. \"Nothing in this Article shall apply to: Any facility, as to \ndiscrimination based on sex, which is distinctly private in nature such as restrooms, shower \n7 \nA098\n\nrooms, bath houses, health clubs and other similar facilities for which the Department, in its \nrules and regulations, may grant exemption based on bona fide consideration of public policy.\" \nRespondent contends that being anatomically correct makes a female, as that was and \nis Respondent's prerequisite before Complainant could be able to use the women's restroom. \nHowever, absence of male genitalia does not make a female, as that could occur by illness or \ninjury. \nMoreover, enforcement of Respondent's approach is inherently problematic.  Broad \ncustomer screening could prove difficult, whether by merely asking the customer if they were \ntranssexual or using a version of \"stop and frisk\" prior to the facility's use. \nSection 1-102(0) reads that \"Sex means the status of being male or female.\"  However, \nthe definition of sex must incorporate Section 1-103 (0-1), \"gender related identity, whether or \nnot traditionally associated with the person's designated sex at birth.\"  Thus, it is not relevant \nwhat the person's sex was at the time of birth.  Sex relates to a person's sexual related identity, \nwhich is discussed below. \nThe same reasoning is used to dismiss the third condition of Respondent's prior to \nComplainant's use of its women's facility.  Respondent required Complainant to change her \nbirth certificate to reflect her current sexual identity.  Complainant's birth gender is academic \nand is not relevant here. \nDiscrimination Standards - Sexual Identity \nIt is not necessary to discuss prima facie elements, as this is a rare case where there is \nno disagreement as to Respondent's action. \nDirect Method of Proof \nThere are two methods for proving discrimination, direct and indirect.  Sola v. Illinois \nHuman Rights Commission, 316 lll.App.3d 528, 736 N.E.2d 1150, (1st Dist. 2000). \nUnder the direct approach, Complainant must present sufficient evidence, direct or \ncircumstantial, without reliance upon inference or presumption, to allow a trier of fact to decide \n8 \nA099\n\nthat her sexual related identity was a motivating factor in Respondent's alleged adverse act.  Id. \nA review of what an employer did and/or said regarding a particular employment decision is \nrequired.  Where there is direct evidence of discrimination, it is unnecessary to use the three \npart analysis.  Catherine Littlejohn and Wal-Mart Stores, IHRC, ALS No. 9929, November 4, \n2009. \nDirect evidence is unique as \"it essentially requires an admission by the decision maker \nthat his actions were based on the prohibited animus .... \"  Daw Cady and Northeastern Illinois \nUniversity, IHRC, ALS No. 10589, February 1, 2005, quoting Havwood v. Lucent Tech, Inc., 169 \nF. Supp.2d 890, 907 (N.D. Illinois 2001 ). citing Radue v. Kimberly Clark Corp., 219 F. 3d 612, \n616 (?th Cir. 2000). (A notice for a teaching position required that candidates \"need to be \nminority.\"); Melvin Osborne and Robert Boudreaux and Steve's Old Time Tap, IHRC, ALS No. \nS-11225, April 25, 2001. (The reason as to why complainants were directed to leave the tavern \nwas based on race as they were told, \"I own this place and you get your Black asses out of \nhere.\") \nAnalysis \nThe evidence in this case establishes that Respondent's decision forbidding \nComplainant access and use of its women's restroom violated the Act, under the direct method \nof proof.  Respondent's motive for its decision was and is Complainant's sexual related identity, \nfemale, a decision that should have been made irrespective of her designated sex at birth, male. \nRespondent substantially relied on a prohibited factor in its decision.  Lalvani v. Illinois Human \nRights Commission, 324111.App.3d 774, 755 N.E.2d 51 (151 Dist. 2001). \n\"There is no surer way to find out what the parties meant, than to see what they have \ndone.\" Eric Sprinkle and Rivers Edge Complex. Inc., IHRC, ALS No. 10565, August 7, 2000, \nquoting Brooklyn Life Insurance Co. v. Dutcher, 95 U.S. 269, 273 (1877).  In this case, the facts \n, \nare straightforward. \n9 \nA100\n\nIt has been established that Complainant is a transgender woman, acknowledged as \nsuch by Respondent in both words and acts.  By July 2010, Complainant had been an \nemployee of Respondent for twelve years, and her transition from male to female was advanced \nand apparent, as she had physical characteristics in conformity with her gender identity. \nIn July 2010, after Complainant's discussion with the store's manager and as a result of \nit, Respondent changed Complainant's personnel records and benefits information to reflect her \ntransition to female.  Employees and employers referred to Complainant as \"Meggan,\" her \nchosen female name, and she performed her assigned duties in feminine dress and makeup. \nHowever, Complainant's request for access to Respondent's women's restroom in its \nstore was denied.  Instead, Respondent created its first precondition.  It demanded from \nComplainant presentment of legal authority that would mandate it to allow a transgender person \nthe use of a store's designated restroom different from that of the person's birth gender. \nIn response, Complainant submitted a copy of her court ordered name change, along \nwith a driver's license and a social security card reflecting that change.  Moreover, a written \nmedical explanation and verification of her transiti.on from Howard Brown Health Center was \nsubmitted, with its recommendation that Complainant be permitted to use Respondent's facility. \nFinally, a copy of the Illinois Human Rights Act was presented, along with other states' laws on \nthe topic of sexual identity. \nRespondent merely directed Complainant to its legal department.  To this day, \nComplainant is being forced to use the restrooms available in other unrelated stores or, since \nJanuary 2014, a \"unisex\" restroom.  The prohibition is enforced by threat of employment \ndiscipline.  For example, in February 2011, Complainant received a written warning because of \nher attempt to use the women's facility. \n10 \nA101\n\nOther Arguments \nThe totality of this order addresses the legal authority that mandates Respondent to \ngrant Complainant access to its women's restroom both as employee and customer, but other \narguments of significance also were raised. \nRespondent added anatomical surgery to the list of preconditions it demanded of \nComplainant.  However, nothing in the Act makes any surgical procedure a prerequisite for its \nprotection of sexual related identity.  Therefore, Respondent's unilateral surgical requirement is \nuntenable. \nRespondent also raised a concern about a woman employee expressing \"discomfort\" \nwith Complainant being present in the women's restroom.  However, a co-worker's discomfort \ncannot justify discriminatory terms and conditions of employment.  The prejudices of co-workers \nor customers are part of what the Act was meant to prevent.  Raintree Health Care Center v. \nIllinois Human Rights Commission, 173 lll.2d 469, 672 N.E.2d 1136, (1996) and Eric Sorinkle \nand Rivers Edge Complex. Inc., IHRC, ALS No.10565, August 7, 2000, (HIV medical condition \nand loss of customers); Jack Haynes and City of Springfield, Office of Public Utilities, IHRC, \nALS No. 7304 (S), April 3, 1998 (unwillingness to be supervised by a black man). \nIn 2014, Respondent built a \"unisex\" single use restroom for Complainant, which \nsegregates only her because of her gender related identity, and perpetuates different treatment, \n3 \ncontrary to the Act. \nRespondent's prohibition and/or segregation of Complainant to a \"unisex\" restroom is an \nadverse act and subjects her to different terms and conditions than similarly situated non-\ntransgender employees. Access to restrooms, if available, is a major and basic condition of \nemployment.  DeClue v. Central Illinois Light Company, 223 F.3d 434 (th Cir. 2000) and OSHA, \nInterpretation of 20 C.F.R. 1910.141 Section (cll1 )(i): Toilet Facilities (April 4, 1998)). \n'  However, the \"unisex\" restroom may resolve any concern by those who are allegedly \nuncomfortable by Complainant, by giving them the option of using it. \n11 \nA102\n\nTherefore, I find that Respondent's decision to restrict Complainant's access to the \nwomen's restroom on account of her gender related identity violated the Act as it concerns both \nemployment and public accommodation.  I further find that the record contains direct evidence \nrelated to both counts of the complaints that the decision was based on the gender related \nidentity of the Complainant. \nRECOMMENDATION \nBased upon the foregoing, there are no genuine issues of material fact and Complainant \nis entitled to a recommended order in her favor as a matter of law. \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n1.  Respondent's motion for summary decision is denied; \n2.  Complainant's motion for summary decision is granted; \n3.  A status hearing is set for June 25, 2015, at 10:00 a.m. when a damages \nhearing date will be set. \nHUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION \nBY:-'-'~~='=·~~...:.-....i'--\" ~ \nWILLIAM J.

So let me just get my      11:31AM\n11 papers in order here.\n12            So it's Mr. Olp and who else?  What was\n13 your name, counsel?\n14     MR.

All the\n18 parties have two lawyers each, so it's a fair fight.\n19            All right.

So let's get into the\n5 discussion.  So, Plaintiffs, Mr. Knight or             11:33AM\n6 Mr. Bergman.\n7     MR. KNIGHT:  Sure, Judge.\n8            So as the Court knows, Nova Maday is an\n9 18-year-old senior.  She'd like to use the gym and\n10 be treated no differently than other girls with        12:45PM\n11 respect to the use of the locker room.\n12            The question is whether she could be\n13 granted use of the locker room for this last semester\n14 without restricting her use of it in a way that no\n15 other girl is restricted.                              12:46PM\n16            Nova's complaint and her Affidavit show\n17 that the forced separation of her from the other\n18 girls makes her feel like an outcast, like she's not\n19 accepted as a girl but is isolated and excluded just\n20 because she's transgender.                             12:46PM\n21            Nova also has a medical condition called\n22 gender dysphoria.  That's a condition where a\n23 person's core understanding of their gender -- for\n24 her it's female -- fails to line up with the\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA109\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 5\n1 individual's sex assigned at birth causing the person\n2 serious clinical distress.  The treatment for that\n3 condition, the reason I mention it, involves social\n4 transition.  Social transition means living full-time\n5 in every way consistent with the new gender.  That's   12:46PM\n6 what Nova would like to do here with respect to\n7 allowing her the usage.\n8  Nova, if allowed to use the locker room,\n9 intends to preserve her modesty.  We pointed it out\n10 in the Complaint and in the Affidavit as well.  The   12:47PM\n11 District has raised the question of swim, swimming in\n12 their responsive brief.  The reality is Nova does not\n13 -- would like to seek an excuse from swimming, would\n14 not participate in that.\n15  But, in general, the School's denial of   12:47PM\n16 locker room usage seems to be premised on the notion\n17 that it would be somehow harmful for the other\n18 students to allow a transgender student to be seen\n19 in a state of undress within the locker room, but the\n20 reality is that's not going to happen.  Nova does   12:47PM\n21 not want that to happen.  She's committed to making\n22 sure that does not happen.\n23  As the Court knows, the preliminary\n24 injunction standard requires Plaintiffs to show a\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA110\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 6\n1 clearly ascertainable protectable right, irreparable\n2 harm and inadequate remedy at law and a likelihood of\n3 success at the merits.\n4  Nova has shown that.  She's at the least\n5 raised a fair question as the cases require that she   12:48PM\n6 has a right to use the girls' locker room like other\n7 girls.  The Human Rights Act make it a civil rights\n8 violation for a public accommodation, including\n9 schools, to deny someone the full and equal enjoyment\n10 of the facility's goods and services of the public   12:48PM\n11 accommodation because of the person's gender identity\n12 or because of other -- because they fall into another\n13 protected class, race, disability, for example.\n14  This has been true since 2006 when\n15 the legislature amended the Human Rights Act to   12:48PM\n16 include sexual orientation which is defined to\n17 include gender identity.  There's just no exception\n18 within the statute for locker rooms or restrooms.\n19  There is a provision which the Intervenors\n20 have pointed to that allows public accommodations to   12:49PM\n21 segregate certain facilities on the basis of gender.\n22 So it is not a violation of the Human Rights Act to\n23 have restrooms for girls or women and restrooms for\n24 men or boys.  That's okay.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA111\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 7\n1  But that does not determine which locker\n2 room a transgender individual gets to use, and this\n3 specific issue in this argument has been addressed\n4 by the Human Rights Commission which the Court knows\n5 is charged with interpreting the Human Rights Act.   12:49PM\n6  That's their responsibility, and they have\n7 found that sex for purposes of gender facilities must\n8 be determined based on gender identity.  That means\n9 that Nova Mayday, the girls' looker room is the right\n10 locker room for her.   12:50PM\n11  Denying -- and, your Honor, as you know,\n12 the School has not said that they want to keep her\n13 out of the locker room entirely.  They've conceded\n14 that she's a girl and should be treated as a girl,\n15 but what they wanted to do, though, is simply place   12:50PM\n16 a limitation on her that no other girl is required\n17 to abide by simply because she's transgender.\n18  Nova has shown that denying her locker\n19 room usage causes her irreparable harm, and the\n20 damages are inadequate to compensate for that harm.   12:50PM\n21 As I pointed out, it denies her the medical treatment\n22 she needs.  It challenges her identity as female.  It\n23 causes her serious distress to be isolated and\n24 excluded.  It's not surprising.  That's the way --\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA112\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 8\n1 that's the whole point of non-discrimination\n2 provisions is to prevent exclusion and isolation and\n3 differential treatment because of someone's\n4 membership in a protected class.\n5            The District's arguments I'd like to        12:51PM\n6 address briefly.  The first argument they make or at\n7 least the primary one, the first argument they make\n8 is that schools are somehow held to a lower standard\n9 than other public accommodations, and they base that\n10 argument on the language of a jurisdictional           12:51PM\n11 provision which is Section 5-102.2.\n12            But to read that jurisdictional section is\n13 a limitation on the liability of a school as a public\n14 accommodation would undermine the purpose of the\n15 Human Rights Act and would create an absurd result.    12:51PM\n16 Your Honor's -- that argument would apply regardless\n17 of whether we're talking about a transgender\n18 individual or an individual with a disability or an\n19 individual who is of racial minority.\n20            What the District seems to want is to be    12:52PM\n21 able to segregate students because of their protected\n22 category.  And if they can do it within a locker\n23 room, then they can do it in the cafeteria or in the\n24 gym or anyplace else there's a school facility.  That\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA113\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 9\n1 cannot be what the General Assembly intended when\n2 they included that provision.\n3            The reality is the legislative history\n4 shows what that provision in terms of jurisdiction\n5 was getting at was to prevent the Human Rights Act     12:52PM\n6 from -- or prevent issues related to the school\n7 curriculum from being reviewed for purposes of\n8 discrimination under the Human Rights Act.  It did\n9 not take away or limit the nature of discrimination\n10 that's covered by the Human Rights Act.                12:53PM\n11            The cases say that where there's wholly\n12 different language in different statutes; that parts\n13 of statutes that language can be read to have a\n14 different effect to indicate that the legislature\n15 intended that, but that is simply not the case here.   12:53PM\n16            Other cases recognize where the language\n17 may be different, but it's substantially the same.\n18 It should be given the same effect.\n19            The reality is what the District has\n20 proposed is a denial of certain use of the locker      12:53PM\n21 room telling her she can't dress in the locker room\n22 where other girls are allowed to dress.  That is a\n23 denial of access to a facility, so it falls within\n24 the jurisdictional provision.  It may not be a\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA114\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 10\n1 complete denial of access to the facility, but it's\n2 still a denial.\n3  And as a result, because it's a denial,\n4 the Courts should then look to Section 5-102 to\n5 determine whether that denial violates the Human   12:54PM\n6 Rights Act.  Of course, a denial, if it applies\n7 across the board, if all girls were told you\n8 can't dress in certain places within the locker room,\n9 that wouldn't be a problem.  But what is a problem is\n10 to discriminate.  And Section 5-102 makes it clear   12:54PM\n11 that discrimination with respect to denying full and\n12 equal use of the locker room because of someone's\n13 protected category is a violation of the Human Rights\n14 Act.\n15  The second argument the District makes   12:54PM\n16 is this argument about the public interest or\n17 balancing and suggests that -- concerns about\n18 community backlash.  They mention the Federal Court\n19 litigation and concerns that are raised or\n20 suggestions that other students are somehow harmed by  12:55PM\n21 having a transgender person in the locker room.\n22 Those can't be a basis for -- or that just simply\n23 cannot be a defense to a violation of the Human\n24 Rights Act.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA115\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 11\n1  The commission and the courts have said\n2 that in numerous times -- and we've cited some of\n3 those cases at pages eight or nine of our brief\n4 that either a employer or a -- cannot rely on the\n5 preferences of third parties like customer   12:55PM\n6 preferences, for example, to justify their\n7 discrimination.  That's what's that argument would\n8 ultimately mean.\n9  In addition, there is no constitutional\n10 privacy interest in refusing to share a locker room   12:55PM\n11 with a transgender student.  Magistrate Judge Gilbert\n12 and Judge Alonso address that very question in the\n13 federal litigation, the Students' and Parents'\n14 litigation that has been going on for several years\n15 there, and he framed the question as, \"Do students   12:56PM\n16 have a constitutional right to refuse to dress in the\n17 same restroom or locker room as students whose sex\n18 assigned at birth was different than their own?\"  And\n19 he found that they don't have such a right.\n20  And he found that, in particular, because   12:56PM\n21 the District has made available to anyone who objects\n22 to dressing in a -- or being in a restroom or\n23 dressing in a locker room with a transgender student,\n24 that there's alternative places to dress.  So it's\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA116\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 12\n1 not -- it is -- there's nothing compelled about the\n2 kind of privacy argument that they're raising here\n3 because they have alternatives that they can pursue.\n4  The District also suggests that no other\n5 court has ordered this kind of relief.  That's simply  12:57PM\n6 not true.  The reality is we've cited several cases\n7 where courts have ordered school districts to make\n8 available restrooms for purposes of -- based on\n9 gender identity.  And as Judge Alonso said in his\n10 recent decision affirming the Students' and Parents'   12:57PM\n11 case, he recognized that there is no legal difference\n12 or no -- between locker rooms and restrooms when it\n13 comes to consideration of discrimination under\n14 Federal Law, Title IX.\n15  The Intervenors have made various   12:57PM\n16 arguments in their brief yesterday.  I can address\n17 some of those now, or I can do that in rebuttal as\n18 the Court prefers.\n19  THE COURT:  Well, you might as well continue and\n20 address their arguments, too.  That would be good.   12:58PM\n21  MR. KNIGHT:  Okay.  So they made an argument\n22 based on this gender segregated facility provision\n23 which I talked about earlier.  That argument,\n24 however, ignores the Hobby Lobby decision or the\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA117\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 13\n1 Sommerville decision that I mentioned.  And the\n2 reality is to accept that argument would effectively\n3 rewrite the Human Rights Act.\n4  To suggest that transgender people are not\n5 able to use locker rooms or restrooms consistent with  12:58PM\n6 their gender identity would mean that schools and\n7 other public accommodations could simply deny someone\n8 the use of a locker room because they're transgender.\n9 So, in other words, what's happened here is that\n10 Nova is told I can't use -- she can't use the locker   12:59PM\n11 room not because she's not a girl but because she's\n12 transgender.  She's a transgender girl.  So they're\n13 going to place some limitations on her as a result of\n14 that.\n15  So, basically, what they're doing is   12:59PM\n16 suggesting writing an extension into the Human Rights\n17 Act that is simply not there.  The argument is based\n18 on this notion that sex is some kind of very narrow\n19 definition.  But the Sommerville decision has\n20 rejected that notion because to set this argument --   12:59PM\n21 and, first of all, sex is defined broadly in the\n22 Human Rights Act.  It is not defined as sex assigned\n23 at birth or some other way of defining sex.\n24  It is the status of being male or female,\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA118\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 14\n1 and in no way suggests that Nova is not female and\n2 shouldn't be treated accordingly.\n3  The Intervenors had suggested that the\n4 Court cannot rely on Affidavits or evidence to\n5 support the preliminary injunction here.  The reality  01:00PM\n6 is we think that the Plaintiffs and the Defendants\n7 have chosen to waive that argument and to allow the\n8 Court to consider those.  We don't believe the\n9 Intervenors should at this late date be able to\n10 object to the consideration of those -- that evidence  01:00PM\n11 that's been provided to the Court.\n12  But, in any event even with that, just\n13 looking at the Complaint and accepting as true the\n14 allegations of the Complaint, the preliminary\n15 injunction should be granted here.  Nova makes it   01:00PM\n16 clear in the Complaint she was denied full use of\n17 the locker room because she's transgender.  That's in\n18 paragraphs 3, 58 and 62 of her Complaint, and she\n19 explains how harmful to that is supporting the fact\n20 that this is irreparable harm to her in paragraphs   01:01PM\n21 9, 10, 63 and 68 of her Complaint.\n22  I'll conclude there.  There are other\n23 arguments that are made by the Intervenor, but I can\n24 address those in rebuttal.  Your Honor, Nova has\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA119\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 15\n1 raised a fair question at the very least.  In fact, I\n2 think she's made a compelling case that she has the\n3 right to use the locker room and cannot be denied\n4 that right or even partially denied that right\n5 because she's transgender.                             01:01PM\n6            She's shown that denying her locker room\n7 usage is causing her irreparable harm, and that can't\n8 be remedied by damages.\n9            Respectfully, your Honor, we'd ask that\n10 the Court grant the motion.                            01:01PM\n11     THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Knight.\n12            Ms. Scott?\n13     MS. SCOTT:  Yes.  Thank you, your Honor.\n14            As we hear counsel argue, they firmly\n15 believe that Ms. Maday is injured if she's not given   01:02PM\n16 unrestricted access to the locker room, and I want to\n17 be very clear that is the relief they are seeking.\n18 Although they've represented Ms. Maday would change\n19 modestly, that's not what they've asked for in the\n20 Complaint.                                             01:02PM\n21            What they've asked for is that she have\n22 unrestricted access which would not require her to\n23 change modestly or any other transgender student.\n24 Frankly, had she represented to the District she\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA120\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 16\n1 wanted to change in private, we wouldn't be before\n2 you.  So the issue is unrestricted access.\n3            I also assume we're going to hear Parents\n4 for Privacy argue that female students who are minors\n5 are harmed by having a transgender student access to   01:02PM\n6 the locker room and the bathroom.  As we've mentioned\n7 to your Honor when we were here on the Motion to\n8 Intervene, the District is currently being sued in\n9 Federal Court by Parents for Privacy with ACLU on the\n10 other side, whether transgender students get any       01:02PM\n11 access at all, and here we're being sued by a\n12 transgender student as to the extent of access.  The\n13 District has been in the middle on both of these\n14 litigations.\n15            But setting aside all of that emotion for   01:03PM\n16 a moment, I'd like to make sure we're very clear on\n17 the facts.  So Ms. Maday identifies as female, and\n18 she is anatomically male.  She has access to female\n19 bathrooms because there are privacy stalls in the\n20 bathrooms.  She's called by her preferred name and     01:03PM\n21 pronoun.  Her school records reflect she's female.\n22            She wasn't enrolled in PE last year, and\n23 she is not enrolled this year.  And, instead, she's\n24 taking classes of her choosing.  Specifically the\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA121\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 17\n1 issue in this case, if Ms. Maday were to take PE, she\n2 would have access to the girls' locker room.  She can\n3 enter with all of the other girls.  She would have an\n4 assigned locker.  She can use the sinks, the mirrors,\n5 the bathroom stalls in there.  She can do her hair     01:03PM\n6 and makeup.  The one condition is that she change in\n7 private in the private changing stalls located within\n8 the locker room.\n9            And attached with our response in\n10 Mr. Kovack's Affidavit were the pictures showing the   01:04PM\n11 private changing stations within the locker room that\n12 are just a few steps away from the lockers.\n13            I also want to be clear that the condition\n14 access that we are offering to Ms. Maday is exactly\n15 the same deal that we struck with the Federal          01:04PM\n16 Department of Education regarding another transgender\n17 student within the District.  In 2013, that student\n18 filed a complaint with the Department of Education\n19 saying that she was denied locker room access.  The\n20 Department of Education initially found in her favor,  01:04PM\n21 and we struck a deal with the Department of Ed.\n22            We agreed in the Resolution Agreement that\n23 based on that student's representation, she would\n24 change in private.  She had access to the looker\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA122\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 18\n1 room.  That is the exact same deal that we are\n2 offering to Ms. Maday in this case.\n3            So turning then to the elements of the\n4 preliminary injunction, if Ms. Maday has a legally\n5 protected right, it's the right to access the locker   01:05PM\n6 room, and the statute is clear on that point.\n7            Secondary school districts like District\n8 211 need to provide access to facilities.  Other\n9 places of public accommodation have a broader\n10 obligation, hotels, restaurants, stores, museums,      01:05PM\n11 theaters.  They have a different standard that\n12 applies to them.  That's where full and equal\n13 enjoyment of the facilities apply, not the school\n14 district.\n15            And in the legislative history of the act,  01:05PM\n16 and I have a copy if your Honor would like it, there\n17 has always been a separate standard for secondary\n18 schools.  It has always been simply denial of access\n19 to the facilities.  (Document tendered.)\n20            That section, part of Section 11, was moot  01:06PM\n21 to other parts of the act, but the actual language of\n22 the denial of access has always applied to schools,\n23 and the language of the full and free enjoyment never\n24 has.  I have a current version of the statute if you\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA123\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 19\n1 would also like it, your Honor.  (Document tendered.)\n2     THE COURT:  So that's kind of a weird\n3 distinction, isn't it?\n4            In other words, restaurants --\n5     MS.

SCOTT:  They have a higher standard, yeah.\n9     THE COURT:  Whereas our government, our\n10 educational institution, namely a government act, has  01:07PM\n11 a lower standard.\n12            Do you know what I'm saying?\n13     MS. SCOTT:  Well, specifically only the school.\n14 It is specifically only to schools.\n15     THE COURT:  That's unusual.                        01:07PM\n16     MS. SCOTT:  Yeah.\n17     THE COURT:  Do you think that's what it means?\n18     MS. SCOTT:  I think that is what it means.\n19            And because in part one of the reasons --\n20     THE COURT:  So, in essence, the government's       01:07PM\n21 allowed to -- I'll use this word just as an analogy\n22 -- to discriminate at a certain level, a higher level\n23 of discrimination than a public place of\n24 accommodation.  That's crazy, isn't it?\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA124\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 20\n1     MS. SCOTT:  Well, I wouldn't use the word\n2 discriminate.\n3     THE COURT:  Well, as I said, it's not the right\n4 word.\n5     MS. SCOTT:  But the General Assembly did apply     01:07PM\n6 different standards, and the Department of Human\n7 Rights recognize that there are different standards\n8 for these, and we had also included that in our brief\n9 and in our appendix.\n10            The Department on their website says under  01:07PM\n11 public accommodation, if you're in a place of public\n12 accommodation, this is your obligation.  If you're in\n13 a school district, it's to provide access.\n14     THE COURT:  I'm just going to pretend you're the\n15 legislature.  What's the logic behind that?  What      01:08PM\n16 kind of argument would you --\n17     MS. SCOTT:  I would not --\n18     THE COURT:  -- phantom?\n19     MS.

I just know that's what they wrote.\n3     THE COURT:  In what year?  What's the effective\n4 date of this?\n5     MS. SCOTT:  It was amended -- this amendment       01:08PM\n6 occurred effective 2007, but the original language\n7 came in about denial of access, I'm not sure of that.\n8     THE COURT:  So 10 years at least ago.\n9     MS. SCOTT:  Yes, at least 10 years ago.\n10     THE COURT:  The world has changed a lot in         01:08PM\n11 10 years, huh?\n12     MS. SCOTT:  The world has changed in 10 years.\n13            But based on the tenets of statutory\n14 construction, the General Assembly did use different\n15 language for whatever reason that they did.  And as I  01:09PM\n16 said, I would not assume to the preliminary task.\n17 They did.  And as your Honor knows, where the\n18 legislature includes language in one section but\n19 excludes it in another, the same statute, we have\n20 to assume they acted intentionally in doing so.        01:09PM\n21            So based on that, Ms. Maday has been\n22 offered access to the locker room.  She has full\n23 rights to go into the locker room.  If she just\n24 agrees, she will change in the privacy stalls.

Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 22\n1 as I said, the Department of Human Rights\n2 investigated this because you have to file a charge\n3 with the Department before you can file a civil act\n4 in court.       They investigated the charge.  They\n5 interviewed people.  They reviewed all of the          01:10PM\n6 documents.  And they did not find substantial\n7 evidence that the District discriminated against\n8 Ms. Maday with regard to locker room access.\n9            And their standard is substantial\n10 evidence.  That is not a high bar.  That is defined    01:10PM\n11 as more than a mere scintilla but less than a\n12 preponderance of evidence.  So even with that low\n13 standard in place, they did not find what the\n14 District offered, the locker room access, was\n15 discriminatory.  And they are the entity statutorily   01:10PM\n16 authorized to administer the Act.\n17            Now, counsel argues that the limitation\n18 in the Amendment 5-102.2 is a jurisdictional\n19 limitation.  I'm not quite sure if they're saying\n20 that's jurisdictional only in the Department and not   01:10PM\n21 the Court.  But the Human Rights Act itself is very\n22 clear that the Court's jurisdiction is the same as\n23 the Department's jurisdiction.  And I could give you\n24 the statutory cite for that if you'd like.

SCOTT:  We are also aware of no case that\n5 holds that a transgender student is entitled to        01:11PM\n6 unrestricted locker room access.  There have been\n7 bathroom cases.  There are no locker room cases.\n8            In the Federal Court litigation, the issue\n9 was keeping the students out of the bathroom and\n10 locker room.  And both the Magistrate Judge and the    01:11PM\n11 District Court Judge denied the Parents for Privacy's\n12 request for preliminary relief.  They had argued\n13 that constitutional right to privacy was violated,\n14 and that a hostile environment was created under\n15 Title IX of the Federal Law.                           01:11PM\n16            Both judges relied on the privacy\n17 protections in place, and neither judge found that\n18 the restricted access was unlawful or inappropriate\n19 in any way.\n20            Turning then to irreparable harm, and as    01:12PM\n21 counsel cited, they rely on the Affidavit from\n22 Dr. Ettner who concludes that Ms. Maday is\n23 experiencing anxiety and depression, and they\n24 conclude that the cause of it is being told -- is\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA128\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 24\n1 from being told that she can use the locker room on\n2 the condition that she agrees to change in a private\n3 changing stall.\n4            We had our expert, Dr. Rom Rymer, review\n5 the Affidavit, and Dr. Rom Rymer pointed out various   01:12PM\n6 flaws with the sufficiency of that Affidavit, and\n7 that Dr. Ettner failed to establish that if Ms. Maday\n8 enrolled in PE, having to change in private within\n9 the locker room, causes the stress or the anxiety as\n10 opposed to numerous other factors in Ms. Maday's       01:12PM\n11 life, including the fact that her father is resistant\n12 to her and denies her transition; that there is a\n13 relationship with her brother; she has a history of\n14 self harm, anxiety and depression.\n15            And Dr. Ettner simply did not take those    01:13PM\n16 factors into account at least in her Affidavit in\n17 coming to her conclusions.  As Dr. Rom Rymer also\n18 points out, Dr. Ettner relied exclusively on what\n19 Ms. Maday told her.  She didn't look at her medical\n20 record, her therapist's record, consult her therapist  01:13PM\n21 or doctor, school records, family members, anything\n22 else.\n23            So to the very high burden of a privy\n24 irreparable harm, that Affidavit isn't sufficient.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA129\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 25\n1 Counsel also relies on Ms. Maday's own Affidavit, but\n2 Ms. Maday herself admits she doesn't want to disrobe\n3 in front of other students, and that it would be\n4 distressing for her to change into her swimwear or\n5 shower in front of other students which is what we're  01:13PM\n6 asking as well.\n7            And then, lastly, your Honor, I want to\n8 look at the balance of harms.  The District is\n9 responsible for providing an educational sound\n10 environment for 12,000 students.  So it's not just     01:14PM\n11 the interest of Ms. Maday at issue here.  It's also\n12 the interest of all of these other students.  And\n13 these students are minors.  There are 14, 15,\n14 16-year-old girls who may or may not be comfortable\n15 changing clothes with a girl who's biologically male.  01:14PM\n16            If an injunction is entered allowing for\n17 unrestricted access which, again, is the relief that\n18 they've requested, then a single student is allowed\n19 to make the determination of whether to expose minor\n20 female students to the student's genitalia.  School    01:14PM\n21 districts have to have the discretion to craft\n22 individualized approaches to these difficult issues.\n23            The District has struck the appropriate\n24 balance between the needs for student privacy and\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA130\n\nNova Maday v.

Both\n2 the Federal Department of Education and the Illinois\n3 Department of Human Rights agree with the approach\n4 the District has taken regarding locker room use.\n5 And the District's approach is consistent with the     01:15PM\n6 requirements of the Human Rights Act.\n7            A preliminary injunction is an\n8 extraordinary remedy, and as your Honor well knows,\n9 it's only to be granted when an extreme emergency\n10 exists.  It's purpose is to preserve the status        01:15PM\n11 quo pending a hearing on the merits of the case.\n12 Locker room access is a novel issue in Illinois\n13 and elsewhere.  It's not been decided by any court\n14 in Illinois.  It's a complex and nuance issue and one\n15 that must be fully developed before a decision can     01:15PM\n16 be entered altering the status quo.\n17            Thank you.\n18     THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you, Ms. Scott.\n19            Mr. Olp?\n20     MR. OLP:  So we have a basic disagreement with     01:15PM\n21 the characterization of the Human Rights Act by\n22 Mr. Knight.  Mr. Knight says the exemption was based\n23 upon -- the exemption for privacy facilities in\n24 Section 5-103(B) is based upon gender.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA131\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 27\n1            But in point of fact, it's very clear that\n2 it's based upon sex, not gender and not gender\n3 identity.  And this exemption, this private\n4 facility's exemption, has been in place for many\n5 years.  In 2006, the category of -- sexual             01:16PM\n6 orientation protections for that work were into the\n7 statute, but this exemption was never removed.\n8            And there are now two definitions that\n9 pertain to this case in the Human Rights Act.  The\n10 first one is sex.  And sex is defined to mean the      01:16PM\n11 status of being male or female.  The status of being\n12 male or female.  That's a binary classification\n13 definition.  It can be either male or female.  And\n14 the exemption is based upon sex.  It basically says\n15 it's perfectly okay.  It's not a violation of the      01:17PM\n16 Human Rights Act for a public accommodation to\n17 segregate privacy facilities based upon sex.\n18            So now that's really the simple answer\n19 to whole case because that's what the District\n20 is doing.  Now our Intervenor group thinks that the    01:17PM\n21 District has gone too far in giving too much access.\n22 We believe that the limit should be at the locker\n23 room door.\n24            But, even so, the restriction that the\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA132\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 28\n1 District has placed, you must use a privacy facility,\n2 is exempt under the private facility's exemption in\n3 the Human Rights Act.  How does the Plaintiff get\n4 round that?\n5            Well, they argue that you can ignore sex    01:18PM\n6 in favor of sexual orientation or gender-related\n7 identity, again, whenever you want, any time after\n8 birth.  But that's not what the law itself says.\n9            And the Sommerville decision, which they\n10 rely on, which is an Administrative Law Judge's        01:18PM\n11 decision, is simply unreasonable, and it reads that\n12 exemption out of the act.  That's improper\n13 interpretation of the legislation.  It's clear that\n14 the legislature did not remove the exemption in 2006\n15 when it added protections for sexual orientation, and  01:18PM\n16 this Court has to read those sections together\n17 harmoniously.\n18            And it can't assume.  It can't presume\n19 that the legislature has erased, nullified, gotten\n20 rid of that exemption.  And that exemption is fully    01:19PM\n21 applicable in this case and fully protects what the\n22 School District did.\n23            So in that respect from the point of view\n24 of a preliminary injunction, the Plaintiff has not\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA133\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 29\n1 articulated a clearly ascertainable right to be\n2 protected.  They have no ability to show, no\n3 likelihood of success on the merits as far as that\n4 goes.  No right they have under HRA.\n5            Mr. Knight references federal privacy       01:19PM\n6 laws, et cetera, but this case is only about the\n7 Human Rights Act.  That's all.  So that's our first\n8 point.\n9            The second point is -- and we've seen the\n10 problem just now -- that this Court can't rely on the  01:19PM\n11 Affidavit extraneous to the Complaint when there's\n12 been no answer.  The issues haven't been joined in\n13 this case.  And Mr. Knight says, oh, we all agree to\n14 do that, and you guys are too late.  But you can see\n15 that based upon the other Affidavit -- we weren't      01:20PM\n16 aware of it -- another Affidavit from another expert\n17 we got was procured by the District which you can see\n18 that they're controverted.\n19            So, therefore, it can't be relied on to\n20 establish irreparable harm.  So we agree with the      01:20PM\n21 District in that respect.\n22            And in terms of the balance of harm and\n23 balance of interest here, Judge, our clients, as the\n24 District says, their students are at the school.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA134\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 30\n1 They have an interest in privacy, and they're minor\n2 students, and their interest is right in the core of\n3 the protection that the Human Rights Act gives to\n4 privacy and privacy facilities.  They want to be\n5 affirmed in their own gender identity, and they have   01:21PM\n6 a right to privacy, too.\n7            How is it that the balance of harms, the\n8 balance of equities, the balance of interests tip\n9 into the Plaintiff's favor?  They don't.  Clearly,\n10 the District is correct in taking into account the     01:21PM\n11 interest of all of the students.\n12            My last point I would make is that the\n13 Plaintiff needs to go to the legislature to find a\n14 solution to this problem.  This Court is not going\n15 to be able to find a solution because the Human        01:21PM\n16 Rights Act clearly, based upon sex, says there's\n17 no claim for a segregated privacy facility.\n18 Therefore, the Plaintiff is not satisfied.\n19            Thank you.\n20     THE COURT:  Okay.  We're back to you, Mr. Knight.  01:21PM\n21     MR. KNIGHT:  Let me first address the Human\n22 Rights Act argument that Intervenors have made.  The\n23 privacy provision does not -- it simply says that\n24 you can't argue that a gender facility is\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA135\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 31\n1 discriminatory on the basis of sex.  It says nothing\n2 about gender identity.  It doesn't define how you\n3 determine the sex of a transgender individual.\n4 That's what the Sommerville decision did is\n5 understand and interpret gender identity is            01:22PM\n6 determining someone's sex.\n7            And that's the only way to read the\n8 statute.  That does not create an exception to the\n9 public accommodations' provision.  It's just not\n10 there.  What that provision was about is to prevent    01:22PM\n11 a boy from claiming I get to use the girls' restroom.\n12 That's the only thing we're talking about here.\n13 My client is a girl.\n14            The only reason why she's being told she\n15 can't use the girls' locker room is because she's a    01:23PM\n16 transgender girl because of her gender-related\n17 identity, that violates the Human Rights Act.\n18            The District persists in misstating the\n19 Resolution Agreement in the Department of Education\n20 case.  The Department of Education made it very clear  01:23PM\n21 that in their findings of discrimination, as we've\n22 shown in our reply brief, that limiting transgender\n23 students and forcing them to dress in private areas\n24 was a violation of Title IX.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA136\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 32\n1            The District's argument that no court has\n2 addressed this particular issue is not quite right in\n3 the sense that, for example, in the Students' and\n4 Parents' case here that Judge Alonso was hearing,\n5 the question was whether -- one of the questions the   01:24PM\n6 Court had to consider was whether or not the\n7 Department's interpretation at that time that\n8 facilities such as restrooms and locker rooms, should\n9 it be available to transgender persons based on their\n10 gender identify, was consistent with Title IX, and he  01:24PM\n11 found that it was.\n12            He found that he reviewed the case law\n13 nationally and found that sex for purposes of\n14 Title IX includes gender identity.  The same -- the\n15 courts are finding the same is true here as the        01:24PM\n16 Sommerville decision did which is to find that for\n17 purposes of that sex or gender-segregated facility\n18 provision, Nova Maday's gender is female.\n19            The District's argument about this\n20 difference in language they talked about earlier I     01:25PM\n21 would simply say, again, that that can't possibly be\n22 what the Human Rights Act intended.  That would allow\n23 the District to tell disabled students they have to\n24 sit in one part of the cafeteria or students --\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA137\n\nNova Maday v.

As long as we let you in there, we\n4 haven't denied you access to the facility.\n5            What they would like to do is rewrite       01:25PM\n6 the jurisdictional provision to say that it's a\n7 denial of complete access, but that's not what it\n8 says.  It simply says a denial of access to a\n9 facility.  What the District has done here is\n10 deny Nova access to the facility in certain ways.      01:25PM\n11 They said it's partial denial, but it's still a\n12 denial of her use of the facility.\n13            Another case that addresses locker room\n14 usage is similar to the one here which is an argument\n15 being made by students that -- transgender students    01:26PM\n16 in Pennsylvania, Boyer Town, Pennsylvania, should\n17 be denied use of locker rooms and restrooms.  It is\n18 clear that that's a district that placed no\n19 limitations on transgender students.  They had full\n20 and complete access to locker rooms.                   01:26PM\n21            The District has suggested that the --\n22 what we're asking for here -- again, they suggested\n23 that what we're asking here is suggesting that\n24 there's some kind of nudity that's going to occur in\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA138\n\nNova Maday v.

First of all, that's not the way\n2 the girls dress within the locker room.\n3            My client intends to do what she\n4 understands other girls do which is to discretely\n5 change into clothing in the locker room without being  01:27PM\n6 forced to dress in these private areas and to ensure\n7 that she protects her modesty.  That does not -- she\n8 should have a choice.  She should not be required to\n9 dress in a private area unless that's the rule for\n10 all the girls.                                         01:27PM\n11            And, your Honor, it's worth pointing out\n12 that the District has not cited any cases that\n13 supports this lower standard.  It's doesn't make any\n14 sense.  So it's not surprising that schools have not\n15 been -- that there's no precedent for this argument    01:27PM\n16 that they're making to suggest that schools don't\n17 or can discriminate in certain ways as long as that\n18 they don't completely deny someone the use of a\n19 facility.\n20     THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me start with the one       01:28PM\n21 factual piece of information that wasn't in anybody's\n22 brief.  And as I was reading everything last night,\n23 it was obviously in my mind, and it was in the mind\n24 -- it would be on the mind of every -- likely every\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA139\n\nNova Maday v.

And that is\n2 I understand and our society understands and our\n3 legislatures understand and the justice of the\n4 Department understands all about gender and the\n5 evolution of changing gender or gender identity,       01:29PM\n6 transsexual, and everybody understands that.\n7            And the statutes are there.  They speak to\n8 sex.  And I have all of this paper, and everybody\n9 gives me the cases, and nobody talks about the only\n10 reason we're here which I've learned this morning,     01:30PM\n11 and I suspect it, is that Plaintiff is anatomically a\n12 male.\n13            It was in nobody's brief, right?  I know\n14 you don't want to talk about it, but you're asking me\n15 to decide something, and it's nowhere in the papers.   01:30PM\n16 Am I right?\n17     MR. OLP:  We thought that was known to everybody.\n18     THE COURT:  All right, so I guess I'm out of the\n19 loop but anyhow --\n20     MR. KNIGHT:  I would say we would disagree with    01:30PM\n21 that statement.  I'm sorry that I didn't address that\n22 earlier.  It's not relevant.  But someone's genitalia\n23 does not determine their sex, and the science is\n24 clear about that.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA140\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 36\n1     THE COURT:  I understand the science.  I'm\n2 looking at the law.  The law is evolutionary as we\n3 all know.  And I would venture to say that -- anyhow,\n4 let me back up.  You disagree with that, that\n5 statement made by Ms. Scott and I don't want to --     01:31PM\n6     MR. OLP:  Judge, can I make a comment?\n7     THE COURT:  Let me say this.\n8            I think that this is the balancing act of\n9 all balancing acts.  Nobody in this room of all the\n10 six lawyers that are here has any ill-will or          01:32PM\n11 ill-intent toward anyone, and that goes without\n12 saying.\n13            Now, the federal cases, the Civil Rights\n14 -- the Office of Civil Rights and their investigation\n15 which resulted in the -- I'll call it a consent        01:32PM\n16 decree or an agreement between the parties as to\n17 a student here in District 211 who is not, obviously,\n18 our Plaintiff, so there was a settlement there.\n19            Now, the Department of Education, Office\n20 of Civil Rights in their November 2nd, 2015 letter     01:33PM\n21 said that the District was violating federal law, I\n22 guess.  So the parties sat down and they arrived at\n23 an agreement in a short time, too, if I'm not\n24 mistaken.  It was November, and the agreement was in\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA141\n\nNova Maday v.

SCOTT:  Correct.\n4     THE COURT:  So -- anyway, but I would say that if\n5 it wasn't for the anatomically male component here,    01:33PM\n6 we wouldn't be sitting here; okay.\n7     MR. KNIGHT:  Your Honor --\n8     THE COURT:  I'm not making a legal statement.\n9 I'm making a commonsense statement.  Anyhow, I think\n10 that that's a factor that is -- like I said, it's not  01:34PM\n11 in any of the papers.  I don't know what it means.\n12 But here is what I will tell you, folks.\n13            This is a monumental balancing act, and\n14 under law, we balance all the time especially in a\n15 courtroom, an equitable courtroom, where equity is     01:34PM\n16 paramount.  So we balance all of the time.\n17            And my mission here is to, first of all,\n18 determine whether the Plaintiff has met the four\n19 basic requirements for injunctive relief, and the\n20 parties have addressed that.  And generally with       01:35PM\n21 injunctive relief, it's a high bar.  We know the\n22 language with respect to that, and it's an\n23 extraordinary remedy, whatever extraordinary means,\n24 and it's highly-fact specific.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA142\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 38\n1            So the facts are very important here, and\n2 I've got a good grip on it.  I read it.  I'll have to\n3 say that I didn't have the full time that I wanted to\n4 devote to it because I had a crazy bunch of cases in\n5 front of this.  But I know that when we got here       01:36PM\n6 earlier, a few weeks ago, three weeks ago before\n7 Christmas, the parties wanted this on an emergency\n8 basis, and that's what we did.  And I commend the\n9 parties for getting all of their submissions to me,\n10 and I read it all.                                     01:36PM\n11            But I don't make decisions until I have a\n12 comfort, and I will tell you right now I don't have a\n13 comfort in what I've -- on two levels, number one, on\n14 what I've read quickly, which I'm going to have to\n15 reread and, secondly, the discussion we had here       01:37PM\n16 today kind of reinforced what the parties put in\n17 writing.  So there were no surprises except for that\n18 one.  I guess I must be naive, but I should have\n19 figured that, and I don't know how that plays into\n20 the equation.                                          01:37PM\n21            Let me ask you, Mr. Knight.  Does it play\n22 into the equation?\n23     MR. KNIGHT:  It does not.  It does not.\n24     THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  Zero?\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA143\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 39\n1     MR. KNIGHT:  Zero.\n2     THE COURT:  Zero?\n3     MR. KNIGHT:  Yes.\n4     THE COURT:  And what's your basis for that?\n5     MR. KNIGHT:  Because there's no exception based    01:37PM\n6 on someone's sex at the time of birth, certain\n7 aspects of their body including genitalia.  There's\n8 no exception for that.\n9            We're talking about discrimination against\n10 someone because they're transgender, and the reality   01:37PM\n11 for the treatment for transgender individuals does\n12 not always include surgery.  And my client has had\n13 the treatment that's appropriate for her at the time,\n14 which includes hormone therapy, and there are a\n15 number of ways in which that changes her body to make  01:38PM\n16 her female.  But the signs are clear that someone's\n17 gender identity is --\n18     THE COURT:  I'm talking about real people.\n19     MR. KNIGHT:  -- in terms of real people.\n20     THE COURT:  I know the science.  I'm talking       01:38PM\n21 about real people, 14- and 15-year-old girls.\n22     MR. KNIGHT:  It does not make a difference.\n23     THE COURT:  I know the science.  You're saying\n24 under the law it doesn't matter.  I don't know the\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA144\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 40\n1 answer to that.  That's why the lawyers are here.  I\n2 value their viewpoint on it.\n3     MR. KNIGHT:  I mean, it's just irrelevant because\n4 she's not going to be getting naked in the locker\n5 room.  She's made that very clear.                     01:38PM\n6     THE COURT:  Yes, but -- how's that fool proof?  I\n7 mean, I agree with that a hundred percent from what\n8 I've read in the papers, and I totally get it, all\n9 right, and -- but I'm not -- I don't want to go\n10 there.                                                 01:39PM\n11            But go ahead, Ms. Scott.\n12     MS. SCOTT:  Yes.  Thank you, your Honor.\n13            For us, this is a critical factor.  She\n14 identifies as female.  She's anatomically male.  She\n15 is a girl with male genitalia in a girls' locker room  01:39PM\n16 with minors.  And so that's when I said the District\n17 has done this very careful, very thoughtful, very\n18 deliberate balancing act of the privacy interest and\n19 support of access to the locker room.  That is\n20 exactly what we're talking about and because of this   01:39PM\n21 circumstance and the male genitalia to be frank about\n22 it.  So that does absolutely come into play.\n23     THE COURT:  How does it come in legally?\n24 Mr. Knight says it doesn't, the law doesn't\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA145\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 41\n1 distinguish or differentiate.  It's just male or\n2 female.  Or maybe the law hasn't caught up with us\n3 yet.\n4     MS. SCOTT:  And it may not.  What the law talks\n5 about is access, that schools have to provide access,  01:40PM\n6 and we do believe we provided access.\n7            Mr. Knight has previously said can schools\n8 make other decisions about like where disabled\n9 students go.  The answer to that is yes.  They can\n10 and they do all the time.  Every student with a        01:40PM\n11 disability has an individual education plan and\n12 they have -- the school is responsible for their\n13 individual education.  So they make these kind of\n14 individual decisions all of the time.  It's very\n15 different than if you're going to a movie theater.     01:40PM\n16 These are kids, minors in school.\n17            So that may answer the question.  Why is\n18 there a different standard for schools?  Because\n19 schools are dealing with minor students who have\n20 individual needs and individual circumstances that     01:40PM\n21 need to be taken into account and balanced.\n22     THE COURT:  Okay.\n23     MR. OLP:  May I speak?\n24     THE COURT:  Sure, you may.\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA146\n\nNova Maday v. Township High School District 211 17 CH 15791 Court Proceedings\nPage 42\n1     MR. OLP:  It is very, very critical, I think, as\n2 to what the -- there's a difference between the male\n3 sex and the anatomically male and gender identity.\n4 In this case, as you know right now, this transgender\n5 girl has a male anatomy.                               01:41PM\n6            Under the Human Rights Act, that makes her\n7 sex male.  Her gender identity is female.  And our\n8 argument is that the Human Rights Act makes an\n9 exception for same sex bathrooms in privacy\n10 facilities based upon sex, maleness/femaleness and,    01:41PM\n11 therefore, not on gender identity which change is\n12 malleable.  And she's transitioned, but she's still a\n13 male.  And, therefore, the District is within its\n14 rights to restrict access to the female locker room.\n15 That's it in a nutshell.                               01:41PM\n16     THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I'm not going to rule on\n17 this this morning or this afternoon at this point.\n18            Let me find a date in my calendar where we\n19 can come back, and I'll give you a ruling, and it\n20 will be a day next week.                               01:42PM\n21            What about the 25th -- off the record.\n22\n23\n24\nScheff & Associates, Inc.  www.scheffreporting.com (312) 214-1994\nA147\n\nNova Maday v.

But I think -- I don't want to -- how\n12 do I put this?  It may come into play on the balance\n13 of hardships.\n14     MR.
