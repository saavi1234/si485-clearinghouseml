Defendants move the Court for a Protective Order asserting at paragraph 4 of their Motion that \"the Court has ordered Defendants to produce the documents in their possession related to the plan to transfer Youth to BCCY-WF.\" Defendants submit that these documents contain confidential information and thus seek a protective order. The Court did not order the production of any documents other than the transfer and detention plan. See Minute Entry 14 . Defendants fail to articulate what confidential information is contained in the plan ordered to be disclosed. Alternatively, Defendants move for an extension of time to disclose the transfer plan. Defendants fail to articulate how an extension of time to disclose the transfer plan obviates the need for a protective order to protect confidential information. The Motion for Protective Order 17 is DENIED, without prejudice. The Motion for extension of time to disclose the transfer and detention plan is DENIED. Although it is entirely unclear to the Court the nature and extent of confidential information that may be included in the plan, the parties are encouraged to reach an agreement to protect confidential information which may be included in the plan.

    "summary": "<p>Louisiana officials announced that they would incarcerate about two dozen children in the former death row of the Louisiana State Penitentiary (commonly referred to as Angola) after Chief District Judge Shelly D. Dick signed off on the transfer. On August 19, 2022, plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, filed suit against Governor John Bel Edwards, Deputy Secretary of the Office of Juvenile Justice William Sommers, and Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections James M. Leblanc in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana to try and stop the transfers. The named plaintiff brought this class action on behalf of himself and all current and future people facing transfer from Bridge City Correctional Center for Youth (BCCY) to Louisiana State Penitentiary or another adult prison.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Louisiana officials announced the plan due to security problems at BCCY. Plaintiffs contend this response was misguided and that by transferring youth to a maximum-security adult prison, Louisiana officials showed deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' health and safety and therefore violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights. Furthermore, for the plaintiffs with disabilities, the required educational and rehabilitative services would not be provided in the adult prison in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 19, 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order that included a request for a preliminary injunction. The court denied the temporary restraining order on August 23, 2022 because it would decide the preliminary injunction question before any of the transfers were scheduled to begin. On September 23, 2022, Chief District Judge Dick, despite describing the prospect of sending teenagers to a maximum-security adult prison as \"disturbing,\" denied the preliminary injunction on the grounds that there was no better option to protect other incarcerated youth at BCCY and the transfers were allowed to proceed.</p>\r\n<p>Since late October 2022, OJJ incarcerated a total of between 70 and 80 youth, some as young as 15, in Angola.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs submitted an amended class action complaint on October 25, 2022. In the amended complaint, plaintiffs added class action claims under the ADA. Plaintiffs alleged that an estimated 70% of youth incarcerated nationwide had disabilities. Given that youth with disabilities were overrepresented in the system, plaintiffs alleged that it was highly likely that some youth who would be transferred to Angola would have disabilities and wouldn&rsquo;t receive the care they needed, in violation of the ADA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 21, 2022, defendants submitted a motion to dismiss plaintiffs&rsquo; claims for lack of standing. The next day, defendants submitted a motion for a stay of discovery pending resolution of their motion to dismiss. Defendants also made an ex parte request to expedite consideration of the stay. The court denied expedited consideration on November 30, 2022, ordering plaintiffs to respond to the motion to stay. The court granted the stay on January 4, 2023. The motion to dismiss was still pending before the court when plaintiffs requested leave to amend the complaint once again, on April 6, 2023. The court denied the request to amend without prejudice, giving plaintiffs leave to refile their motion after the court issued a decision on defendants&rsquo; motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs submitted another motion for a preliminary injunction on July 17, 2023. Plaintiffs alleged that, despite their assurances to the court, defendants had not given youth at Angola temporary therapeutic placements. Rather, they alleged, defendants regularly confined young people in prolonged isolation, failed to provide them the educational and other services promised, and subjected them to excessive heat and other dangerous living conditions. The court set a hearing date for August 15, 2023, and ordered defendants to withdraw their motion to dismiss by July 21, 2023, if they had the intention to do so. Defendants withdrew the motion on July 21, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Department of Justice&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division (DOJ) filed a statement of interest in the matter on behalf of plaintiffs on July 28, 2023. The statement drew attention to the irreparable harms the youth faced if they were continued to be incarcerated in Angola, due to their harmful conditions of confinement and periods of prolonged isolation. Among other things, the DOJ highlighted plaintiffs&rsquo; allegations that there were no teachers to provide youth instruction, there was inadequate access to recreation and exercise, excessive heat, a lack of adequate ventilation, and inadequate access to safe drinking water. The DOJ&rsquo;s statement explained that many of the youth incarcerated at Angola likely had a history of trauma, and these conditions were highly likely to cause psychological harm and to their suffering.</p>\r\n<p>On August 10, 2023, defendants filed a motion to remove one of plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys. The court ruled on the motion the next day, finding that plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel inappropriately communicated ex parte with a witness. The witness was being deposed remotely by video to provide opinion testimony, during which counsel communicated with them by text, pointing them to factual evidence. The court denied defendants&rsquo; request for further sanctions, but granted expert video testimony on the matter.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification was granted on August 31, 2023. 2023 WL 5628592. The proposed class consisted of all current and future youth in OJJ custody who had been, would, or could be held at Angola or another adult prison. The subclass consisted of current and future youths with disabilities who were, would be, or had the potential to be transferred to Angola or another adult prison. The court found that plaintiffs had adequately demonstrated adequacy of representation, as well as the standard numerosity, commonality, and typicality requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A week after granting class certification, the court granted plaintiffs&rsquo; July 2023 motion for a preliminary injunction on September 8, 2023. 2023 WL 5984280. Defendants were ordered to remove youth from Angola within the week, with a deadline of September 15. The court found the record showed defendants locked children in cells for days at a time as a form of punishment; punished youth with handcuffs, mace, and denial of family visits; failed to provide adequate staffing (including no licensed social worker or professional counselor); failed to provide appropriate education and special education where necessary, and failed to provide necessary and appropriate mental health treatment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court evaluated the likelihood of success of plaintiffs&rsquo; claims regarding conditions of confinement by applying the deliberate indifference standard under the Eighth Amendment. Under this standard plaintiffs had to satisfy both an objective and subjective requirement, showing that a person was incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm, defendants were aware of facts from which they could draw the inference that the risk existed, subjectively drew the inference that the risk existed, and then disregarded the risk. The court found that enough evidence had been presented to reach the conclusions that 1) cell restrictions as used at Angola were de facto solitary confinement, both in use and affect, and 2) defendants had knowledge of the serious harms posed by solitary confinement, but were &nbsp;indifferent to the risk. The court also found that the excessive confinement of youth in their cells, untrained and undocumented use of handcuffs, Angola corrections officers&rsquo; use of mace, and systematic denial of family interactions for punitive reasons violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, the court held that plaintiffs had successfully demonstrated that youth with disabilities in Angola were being denied necessary services to which they were entitled to as a matter of law. As a result, the court concluded that plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs had previously demonstrated irreparable harm, and new evidence had added further psychological harms; as caused by being in adult prison cells, excessive and/or unwarranted cell restriction and macing, and the lack of education, mental health, and rehabilitative services. Finally, the court found that what changed in the 10 months since plaintiffs&rsquo; had first requested a preliminary injunction in September 2022 was the OJJ&rsquo;s broken promises to protect the constitutional rights of the youth incarcerated at Angola, weighing the balance of harms and public interest in their favour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 11, 2023, defendants appealed the orders granting the injunction and class certification, as well several rulings issued on discovery disputes. They also requested a stay of the injunction pending appeal. The District Court denied the stay the next day, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a stay on September 14.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout 2024, the case was mired in discovery disputes, with plaintiffs pressing for compliance and defendants seeking protective orders and extensions. Defendants renewed their attacks on the suit, filing motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and to decertify the class.</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, 2025, Chief Judge Dick granted defendants&rsquo; amended motion to dismiss, denied decertification as moot, and closed the case. The court found that plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were moot because all children had already been removed from Angola, and there was no ongoing or imminent threat that OJJ would return them there. As a result, the court concluded that plaintiffs no longer faced a live controversy under Article III&rsquo;s case-or-controversy requirement, and their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief could no longer be granted.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where the case remains pending.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Defendants, Governor Jon Bel Edwards, in his official \ncapacity as Governor of Louisiana, William Sommers (“Sommers”), in his official capacity \nas Deputy Secretary of the Office of Juvenile Justice (“OJJ”), and James M. Leblanc, in \nhis  official  capacity  as  Secretary  of  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Public  Safety  & \nCorrections (“DOC”)(collectively “Defendants”), filed an Opposition2 to Plaintiff’s motion.  \nThe Court denied Plaintiff’s Motion for Temporary Restraining Order3 and set the matter \n \n1 Rec. Doc. No. 3. \n2 Rec. Doc. No. 28. \n3 Rec. Doc. No. 15. \nPage 1 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 2 of 64\nfor a Preliminary Injunction hearing,4 which was held on September 6 through September \n8, 2022.5 The Parties were granted leave to file post-hearing memoranda.6   \nThis case presents an untenable proposition to house adolescents, some as young \nas 12 years old, who have been determined to be juvenile delinquents, at the notorious \nAngola Penitentiary in a cell block which once housed death row inmates. A few of the \nadolescents adjudicated as “delinquent” and placed in the secure care of the OJJ present \nformidable security and safety risks. OJJ is charged with a rehabilitative, not punitive, \nmission. But a small handful of youth have wreaked havoc, endangering themselves, \nother youth, OJJ staff, and members of the general public. Ongoing and repeated acts of \nviolent and disruptive behavior by a few has reduced OJJ to becoming security enforcers \ninstead of rehabilitators.  \nFor  the  reasons  which  follow,  the  Court  finds  that  the  Plaintiff’s  Motion  for \nPreliminary Injunction shall be denied. The prospect of putting a teenager to bed at night \nin a locked cell behind razor wire surrounded by swamps at Angola is disturbing. Some \nof the children in OJJ’s care are so traumatized and emotionally and psychologically \ndisturbed that OJJ is virtually unable to provide a secure care environment. While locking \nchildren in cells at night at Angola is untenable, the threat of harm these youngsters \npresent  to  themselves,  and  others,  is  intolerable.  The  untenable  must  yield  to  the \nintolerable.  \nThe Court finds that OJJ has shown that it will provide a constitutional level of care \nto youth transferred to the Temporary Transitional Treatment Unit (“TTU”) proposed to be \n \n4 Rec.

The Court is mindful that the specter of the prison surroundings alone \nwill likely cause psychological trauma and harm. However, the public interest and the \nbalance of harms require that OJJ be afforded the latitude to carry out its rehabilitative \nmission for the benefit of all youth in its care.   \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn July 19, 2022, in response to several recent incidents of serious events at OJJ \nsecure care facilities, including riots, attempted and successful escapes, and acts of \nviolence against staff, other youth, and members of the public, Louisiana’s Governor John \nBel Edwards held a press conference announcing that the state will “temporarily move” \napproximately 25 youth in the custody of OJJ from Bridge City Center for Youth (“BCCY”), \na juvenile secure care facility, to the grounds of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola \n(“LSP” or “Angola”).7 \nOn August 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed a class action complaint against the Defendants \non behalf of a putative class of all current and future persons held at BCCY who might be \ntransferred to LSP or another adult prison. Plaintiff asserts claims under the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n29 U.S.C. § 794.8   The Plaintiff moved for an Emergency Temporary Restraining Order \nseeking  to:  (1)  enjoin  Defendants  from  transferring  or  incarcerating  Plaintiff  or  any \nproposed Class member at LSP, and (2) enjoin Defendants to immediately return any \nyouth who may have already been transferred to LSP to BCCY or another appropriate \nOJJ facility for youth.9  \n \n7 PX 7; Rec. Doc. No. 4-2, p. 1. \n8 Rec. Doc. No. 1.  \n9 Rec. Doc. No. 3.  Memorandum in support filed at Rec. Doc. No. 9. \nPage 3 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 4 of 64\nOn August 23, 2022, the Court held a telephonic status conference, during which \nDefendants stipulated that no youth had been or would be moved to Angola until on or \nafter September 15, 2022.10 The Court denied Plaintiff’s emergency motion for a TRO \nand  set  this  matter  for  a  Preliminary  Injunction  hearing.11  The  Court  set  expedited \ndeadlines for discovery, including depositions and disclosure of experts.12  The Parties \nconducted limited, expedited discovery. The Preliminary Injunction hearing was held from \nSeptember 6 through September 8, 2022.  \nI.  PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT (“PLRA”) EXHAUSTION \nThe Parties dispute whether Alex A. exhausted administrative remedies under the \nPLRA before filing this action.  At the Preliminary Injunction hearing, neither Plaintiff nor \nDefendants presented evidence on this issue, and they offered no arguments other than \nthose previously briefed.  Thus, the Court will rule on this issue based on the pleadings \nbefore the Court.  \nAlex  A.  lodged  an  emergency  Administrative  Remedy  Procedure  (“ARP”) \ngrievance,  which  was  denied.13    Defendants  contend  that,  following  denial  of  the \nemergency ARP, Alex A. was required to engage the general ARP procedure, which he \ndid not do, and thus he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.  The general ARP \nprocess takes 51 days, which Plaintiff claims would render the emergency process \nmeaningless.  \nDefendants maintain that there is nothing in the ARP policy of OJJ that exempts a \nyouth from utilizing the “still available” general ARP process before filing suit; thus, \n \n10 Rec.

The  same \nargument advanced by the Defendants was recently rejected by another section of this \nCourt.   In J.H. v. Edwards,14 Judge deGravelles noted that:  \nThe Fifth Circuit has explained the following about exhaustion of remedies \nunder the PLRA: \nThe  PLRA  requires  inmates  to  exhaust  “such  administrative \nremedies  as  are  available”  before  filing  suit  in  federal  court  to \nchallenge prison conditions. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). This exhaustion \nobligation  is  mandatory—there  are  no  “futility  or  other  [judicially \ncreated] exceptions [to the] statutory exhaustion requirements....” \nBooth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 n.6, 121 S. Ct. 1819, 149 L. Ed. \n2d  958  (2001).  So  long  as  the  State's  administrative  procedure \ngrants “authority to take some action in response to a complaint,” that \nprocedure is considered “available,” even if it cannot provide “the \nremedial action an inmate demands.” Id. at 736, 121 S. Ct. 1819 \n(emphasis added); see also id. at 739, 121 S. Ct. 1819 (“Congress \nmeant to require procedural exhaustion regardless of the fit between \na  prisoner's  prayer  for  relief  and  the  administrative  remedies \npossible.”). \nBy  contrast,  a  remedy  is  not  “available”—and  exhaustion  is  not \nrequired—when: \n1. The procedure “operates as a simple dead end” because “the \nrelevant  administrative  procedure  lacks  authority  to  provide  any \nrelief,” or “administrative officials have apparent authority, but decline \never to exercise it.” \n2. The “administrative scheme [is] so opaque that ... no reasonable \nprisoner can use them.” \n3.  Or  when  “prison  administrators  thwart  inmates  from  taking \nadvantage  of  a  grievance  process  through  machination, \nmisrepresentation, or intimidation.” Ross v. Blake, ––– U.S. ––––, \n136  S.  Ct.  1850,  1859–60,  195  L.Ed.2d  117  (2016)  (quotation \nomitted).15 \n \n14  No. 20-293-JWD-EWD, 2020 WL 3448087 (M.D. La. June 24, 2020). \n15 Id. at *41 (quoting Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797, 804 (5th Cir. 2020)). \nPage 5 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 6 of 64\nTurning to OJJ’s ARP policy, the Court observed that: “the ARP Policy does not \nappear to require youth to exhaust the standard two-step procedure after they have filed \nan emergency procedure.”17  OJJ’s emergency ARP policy provides: \nIf a youth's ARP contains statements which indicate he believes he is at \nimmediate risk of harm and any delay in responding to the grievance would \nsubject the youth to substantial risk of immediate personal injury or cause \nother serious or irreparable harm, the ARP Coordinator shall immediately \nforward the ARP, or that portion of the ARP which alleges substantial risk \nof imminent personal injury or cause serious or irreparable harm, to the \nFacility Director, Regional Director, and IS. The Regional Director shall \nprovide an initial response with 48 hours and issue a final decision with five \n(5) calendar days.18 \nBased on the plain language in the ARP policy, the Court in J.H. reasoned: “both \nthe ARP Policy and the youth ARP Instructions indicate that the Emergency ARP results \nin a ‘final decision,’ which would logically mean that the Youth could proceed to the ‘next \nstep’ of filing suit.”19  \nIn this matter, without mentioning J.H., Defendants endeavor to get around the \nCourt’s ruling on exhaustion by stating:  \n103.  OJJ’s  ARP  does  not  except  Youths  from  addressing  grievances \nthrough the standard two-step process if they do not receive emergency \nrelief where requested. See generally ARP Policy (Doc. No. 28-1). In other \nwords, the ARP includes no provision for complete curtailment of the two-\nstep grievance process, even where a Youth is denied emergency relief. In \nfact, the ARP specifically states that a Youth may seek judicial review after \nthe conclusion of Step 2 of its standard process but contains no such \nlanguage in the emergency grievance provision. See id. at 9-10. Thus, the \nordinary grievance process remains “available” within the meaning of the \nPLRA  even  after  an  inmate  has  sought  administrative  relief  under  an \nemergency grievance. See, i.e., Brown v. Eardley, 184 F. App’x 689, 691-\n92 (10th Cir. 2006) (holding administrative remedies were still available to \ninmate through standard grievance process even though warden did not \n \n17 Id. \n18 Rec. Doc. No. 28-1, pp. 3-16 (emphasis added). The same language was analyzed by Judge DeGravelles \nin the J.H case, id. at *43. \n19 Id.  \nPage 6 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 7 of 64\nrespond to emergency grievances within the three days required under \napplicable regulations); Brazell v. Ruh, 2015 WL 2452410, at *3-4 (E.D. Ark. \nMay 21, 2015) (same).20 \nDespite this argument, the ARP policy is unchanged from the policy language \nevaluated by Judge deGravelles in J.H.21 The Court finds that the denial of Alex A.’s \nemergency ARP constituted a final decision upon which Plaintiff could rely in filing suit.  \nAlternatively, the Court finds that, following a denial of the emergency ARP,  the remaining \nprocedure “operates as a simple dead end” because the second step procedure, urged \nby the Defendants, “lacks authority to provide any relief.”22 Furthermore, if applied as \nadvocated by the Defendants the “administrative scheme [is] so opaque that ... no \nreasonable prisoner can use them.”23  \nII.  FINDINGS OF FACT \nThe Court has considered the Parties’ pre-hearing and post-hearing briefs, the \nevidence admitted during the hearing, and the applicable law.24  The Court’s credibility \nfindings, findings of fact, and conclusion of law are set forth below pursuant to Rule 52(a) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  If any finding is in truth a conclusion of law, or if \nany conclusion stated is in truth a finding of fact, it shall be deemed so.

OJJ Background, Structure, and Impetus for Transfer Plan \n11. The OJJ is the state agency responsible for providing rehabilitation services to \nyouth who have been adjudicated delinquent.37 OJJ’s Deputy Secretary for Youth \nservices is charged with establishing all rules and regulations for the placement, \ncare, and treatment of youth in the custody of the OJJ.38 The OJJ has sole authority \nover  the  placement,  care,  treatment,  or  any  other  considerations  deemed \nnecessary from the resources that are available for children judicially committed to \nthe Department.39  \n12. OJJ currently maintains five secure care facilities across the state: Acadiana \nCenter for Youth at Bunkie (“ACY”), Acadiana Center for Youth at St. Martinville \n(“ACY-SM”), Bridge City Center for Youth (“BCCY”), Swanson Center for Youth at \nMonroe  (“SCY”  or  “Swanson-Monroe”),  and  Swanson  Center  for  Youth  at \nColumbia (“SCY-C”).40 \n13. Several factors inform a youth’s placement in a secure care facility rather than a \nless restrictive facility, including (1) the violent nature of the underlying criminal act; \n(2) commission of a crime of sexual assault; (3) a history of repeated commission \nof serious crimes; and/or (4) the youth’s failure to respond in a  less restrictive \nrehabilitation program/facility.41   \n \n37 La.

OJJ  secure  care  facilities  include  housing  dormitories,  common  areas, \ngymnasiums,  outdoor  recreational  areas,  schools,  medical  and  counseling \nfacilities, and dining areas.42 \n15. Most youth in OJJ secure care facilities reside in dormitories which accommodate \ntwelve to fifteen Youth. The youth can move freely in their dormitories.43 \n16. Most youth offenders in OJJ secure care facilities have demonstrated an ability to  \nadapt to the secure environment and comply with behavioral rules and facility \npolicies.44 \n17. Recently there has been a significant increase in the frequency and severity of \nserious incidents at OJJ secure care facilities, including destruction of property, \nattempted and successful escapes, acts of violence against staff and other youth, \nand injury to a member of the public. A small population of the youth, approximately \n25, have engaged in violent and destructive behavior which has caused significant \ndisruption in OJJ’s ability to deliver educational and rehabilitation services to the \nother youth in its custody.45 OJJ Deputy Secretary Sommers estimates that “about \nfive percent of the youth give us the most problems.”46 \n18. Some  youth  have  repeatedly  escaped  and  have  engaged  in  violent  criminal \nbehavior before being returned to OJJ.  Youth who have escaped from OJJ secure \ncare facilities have been accused of motor vehicle theft, carjacking, burglary, \n \n42 See generally 9/6/22 Testimony of Gagnard; 9/7/22 Testimony of Dr. Dandrige, Nelson at 11:11-11:12; \n9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers, Deville, and Patin. \n43 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson, generally; 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers, generally. The Cypress Unit at \nSwanson Monroe is a facility providing single rooms with locking doors. \n44 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 11:04; 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers, generally. \n45 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 11:03 -11:30; 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:06, 10:42.  \n46 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:36-10:37. \nPage 13 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 14 of 64\narmed robbery, attempted murder, reckless operation of stolen vehicles, and illegal \npossession of handguns.47   \n19. A  small  percentage  of  the  OJJ  population  have  caused  substantial  property \ndestruction across OJJ campuses, with some dorms having been destroyed to the \npoint  of  being  uninhabitable.48  These  youth  have  also  become  increasingly \naggressive and have engaged in serious acts of violence against other youth and \nOJJ staff, resulting in “severely broken bones, crushed skulls, broken fingers, eye \nsockets” resulting, in some instances, in “lifelong injuries to some [OJJ] staff \nmembers.”49 \n20. Other youth have been victimized by the high-risk youth when they try to go to \nsleep at night, and they have reported to Nelson that they are afraid to go to sleep \nat night for fear of being attacked by these high-risk youth.50  \n21. The high-risk youth have created weapons like shanks, and they have used pipes \nfrom the walls and ceilings (of facilities they have destroyed) as weapons.  They \nhave destroyed security cameras so their behavior cannot be observed by OJJ \nsecurity.51  Rival groups have emerged who fight each other, particularly during \nrecreational time.52 \n \n47 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson 11:44-11:51. \n48 Id. at 11:03-11:04; DX 15-40 (Unusual Recurrence Reports (“UOR”) and photographs of damage to \nproperty from March 2021 through July 6, 2022). \n49 Id. at 11:08-11:09.  \n50 Id. at 11:11. \n51 Id. at 11:12-15. \n52 Id.  \nPage 14 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 15 of 64\n22.  In 2021, the Cypress Unit at Swanson, Monroe housed high-risk youth in need of \na high level of security; the Cypress Unit provided single rooms and locking \ndoors.53  \n23.  In May 2021, the Cypress Unit was “completely destroyed” by the high-risk youth \nhoused there.54 Nelson testified that he had “never seen that type of destruction to \nany  building,”55  and  the  photographic  evidence  admitted  supported  this \ntestimony.56 \n24. Having no secure location to house these youth, OJJ transferred them to the Ware \nfacility in Alabama, but the youth destroyed that facility as well.57  Sommers \ntestified that, very soon after the youth were transferred to the Ware facility, \nAlabama officials demanded their removal.58  \n25. More recently, on June 13, 2022, at least five youth were involved in a physical \naltercation outside of the school building at SCY, referred to by Nelson as a riot. \nAt least four staff members were battered by the youth, and one staff member was \ntransported to the hospital for treatment of injuries.59   \n26. On June 16, 2022, around 20 youth escaped their dormitory at BCCY, took over \npart of the facility, and caused a riot. The riot resulted in injuries requiring medical \nattention to at least two youth. At least one staff member was hospitalized due to \ninjuries. Ultimately, five youth escaped the BCCY secure care facility.60 \n \n53 Id. at 11:14. \n54 Id. at 11:03. \n55 Id. \n56 DX 36.  \n57 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 2:44-2:45. \n58 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:43. \n59 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 11:44; 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:06. \n60 Id. \nPage 15 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 16 of 64\n27. On July 17, 2022, six youth escaped the BCCY facility. Five of the youth stole a \ntruck from a nearby residence, repeatedly rammed it into a Jefferson Parish \nSheriff’s Deputy’s vehicle,  and led officers on a short pursuit before finally crashing \nthe stolen truck. Most of the escaped youth were apprehended, but one youth \nmanaged to get away.  The escaped youth then carjacked and shot the driver, who \nwas critically injured and remained hospitalized at the time of the hearing.61 \n28. The high-risk youth, primarily housed at BCCY, have destroyed the facility to the \npoint that it can no longer provide enough beds for the youth.62 \n29. Due to repairs and improvements that have become necessary, OJJ lacks high \nsecurity accommodations for the high-risk youth in OJJ custody.63 \n30. OJJ  is  in  the  process  making  substantial  repairs  to  the  structures  and \nreinforcement of the security infrastructure at some of its facilities.64  \n31. High-risk youth are stepped up to a higher level of secure care and therapeutic \nintervention in what is known as a Transitional Treatment Unit (“TTU”).65 \n32. A new TTU at Swanson-Monroe is expected to come online in April 2023.67  \n33. Before  the  July  17,  2022  escape  from  BCCY,  OJJ  had  been  looking  for  an \nacceptable facility to utilize as a TTU.68  Specifically, OJJ had looked into options \nat Jetson and a jail in St. Charles Parish.69  No facility on the grounds of Angola \nwas under consideration.70  After July 17, 2022, however, OJJ determined that \n \n61 Id. at 11:45-11:50. \n62 DX 1.  \n63 See generally Testimony of Nelson & Sommers. \n64 See generally Testimony of Nelson, Sommers, & Patin. \n65 DX 2 & DX3. \n67 DX 1; 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 9:40-9:42. \n68 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:03-10:04; 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 11:50-11:51. \n69 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:04. \n70 Id. at 10:03. \nPage 16 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 17 of 64\nnone of the options being considered could provide the level of safety and security \nrequired to house the high-risk youth.71  Thus, the facility on the grounds of Angola \nknown as the Reception Center and three other jails were considered as potential \noptions.72 \n34. Local politics and the “not in my backyard” community reaction to the July 17, 2022 \nescape from BCCY, and the aftermath, contributed to the urgency to locate a \nfacility that provided a high level of security.73  \n35. The Court finds that the evidence overwhelmingly established an immediate need \nfor a more secure facility.74   \nC. The Bridge City Center for Youth at West Feliciana (“BCCY-WF”) Plan \n36. In response to the need for a greater level of individualized treatment in a more \nrestrictive housing environment, OJJ is establishing a TTU to effectively deliver its \nrehabilitative services.78 \n37. OJJ has begun renovations at several secure care facilities across the state, \nincluding a newly-renovated TTU at Swanson-Monroe, and these efforts continue. \nThe new TTU at Swanson will have 72 beds and is scheduled to be completed at \nthe end of April 2023. The TTU at BCCY-WF is a temporary placement until the \nSwanson-Monroe TTU is online.80 \n38. While repairs are being made at existing secure care facilities and pending the \ncompletion of the TTU at Swanson-Monroe, OJJ identified the Reception Center, \n \n71 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 2:44-2:45.   \n72 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:05. \n73 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 9:42-9:43; 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:05. \n74 See Findings of Fact Nos. 17-27. \n78 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:03-10:04; -11:51; DX 3. \n80  9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 9:40-9:42, 9:50. \nPage 17 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 18 of 64\nan unused building on the campus of LSP that, with minor modifications, can \ntemporarily serve as a TTU.81 This building was most recently used to house \nfemale inmates evacuated from the St. Gabriel Women’s Prison following the 2016 \nflood.82  Before this building was repurposed to serve as the Reception Center, it \nwas the death row cell block at LSP.83  \n39. The proposed temporary TTU at Angola is to be called Bridge City Center for Youth \nat West Feliciana (“BCCY-WF”).84 \n40.  While far from ideal, the Court finds that the BCCY-WF location has adequate  \nphysical facilities needed to temporarily house high-risk youth.85 \n41. The Court finds that this temporary solution is necessary pending completion of \nthe permanent TTU at Swanson-Monroe.86 \n42. At full capacity, BCCY-WF will house between twenty-four to thirty youth who are \neligible for placement in the TTU pursuant to OJJ policy.87  The plan is to populate \nBCCY-WF in three phases, with eight youth being placed at the facility in each \nphase.  BCCY-WF will not open on day one with twenty-four youth.88  \n43. BCCY-WF should be capable of receiving youth by the end of September 2022.89  \n \n81 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson, generally; 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin, generally. \n82 9/6/22 Testimony of Gagnard at 9:44. \n83 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 9:41. \n84 DX 1; 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 9:40-9:42, 11:51. \n85 DX 1; Testimony of Sommers, generally. \n86 DX 1; 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 9:40-9:42. \n87 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 11:03; 2:37. \n88 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin at 4:15. \n89 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 9:50; 9/8/22 at 4:38 - Counsel for Defendants stipulated that no youth \nwould be transferred to BCCY-WF before September 23, 2022. \nPage 18 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 19 of 64\n44. The Court finds that the evidence established that no youth will be transferred to \nBCCY-WF  until  the  facility  is  ready,  properly  staffed,  and  can  fully  provide \neducational, medical, mental health, recreational, and food services.90  \nD. Relationship Between BCCY-WF, LSP, and DOC Security \n45. On August 29, 2022, OJJ and DOC signed a Memorandum of Understanding \n(“MOU”) outlining the relationship, rights, and responsibilities regarding BCCY-\nWF.91 \n46. Federal law requires that juvenile delinquents may not be housed in any institution \nwhere they could have sight or sound contact with adult inmates.92  Federal law \nalso  contemplates  the  existence  of  “collocated  facilities”  and  requires  that \nindividuals who work with both juveniles and adult inmates be trained and certified \nto work with juveniles.93 \n47. BCCY-WF  is  approximately  100  yards  inside  the  main  gates  of  LSP  and \napproximately 1.5 miles from the nearest adult housing unit.94 \n48. The Court finds that the evidence established that youth housed at  BCCY-WF will \nnot come in contact with adult inmates.95 \n49. The  Court  finds  that  the  evidence  established  that  OJJ  is  eliminating  the \nopportunity for youth to be within sight and sound of adult inmates. \n \n90 DX 1; 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:46; 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin at 4:01, 1:14. \n91 PX 32; 9/7/22 Testimony of Gagnard at 9:30.   \n92 34 U.S.C. § 11133(12)(A).

The existing perimeter fence around BCCY-WF will be wrapped in solid fabric to \nblock views.96 \n51. OJJ will provide all maintenance services except for repairs to damage to the \nfacility’s  infrastructure.97    OJJ  has  contracted  for  private  lawn  and  grounds \nmaintenance for the perimeter, both inside and outside the fenced area of BCCY-\nWF.  DOC will install signage around BCCY-WF to notify trustees that the facility \nis off-limits. DOC staff will be used as necessary for maintenance to the facility, but \nno LSP inmate labor will be used inside or outside the building for any reason.98 \n52. OJJ will run BCCY-WF independent of LSP. However, the MOU provides that DOC \nmay assist OJJ with staffing by providing interior and perimeter roving security. \nDOC is presently providing roving security at other OJJ secured facilities where \nstaffing shortages exist.99  \n53. DOC  may  provide  cafeteria  operations,  maintenance,  and  exterior  security \nsupport.100   \n54. DOC security will not be on tiers or delivery service; they are only there to assist if \ncalled for a disturbance.101 \n55. LSP will have no operational authority over the TTU,102 and LSP will provide \nsupplemental security for BCCY-WF only upon request.103 \n \n96 DX 1. \n97 DX 1; PX 32. \n98 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin at 3:56-3:57. \n99 DX 1. \n100 DX 1. \n101 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin at 4:18. \n102 9/6/22 Testimony of Gagnard at 9:45; PX 32. \n103 Id. at 9:30; PX 32. \nPage 20 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 21 of 64\n56.

The parties to the MOU acknowledge that, “[d]uring this temporary timeframe, \nDOC/LSP staff shall utilize chemical spray, electron control weapons (“Tasers”) \nand the use of force continuum for which they are trained.”105  This procedure, \navailable to DOC supplemental security officers, is not unique to the BCCY-WF \nfacility but is true of all OJJ secure care facilities.106  Any use of force on the \ncontinuum requires permission by an OJJ supervisor.107 \n58. OJJ will be responsible for the training of any LSP/DOC personnel.108 \n59. Based on the above, the Court finds that the TTU at BCCY-WF will be run by OJJ \nalone; DOC will only be utilized in a manner consistent with the terms of the MOU \nand historical practices. The Court further finds that OJJ has taken the appropriate \nmeasures to insulate the youth at BCCY-WF from contact with adult inmates at \nLSP and to eliminate sight and sound of LSP inmates. \nE.  TTU Policy, Programs, and Services \n60. The Youth Services Policy for the TTU states that the purpose of the TTU is “[t]o \nestablish the program objectives and the criteria for the placement of youth and \nyouth with disabilities in the Transitional Treatment Unit (TTU) located at the Bridge \nCity Center for Youth at West Feliciana. All students with disabilities assigned to \n \n104 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin at 4:18; PX 32. \n105 PX 32, p. 2.  \n106 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin at 3:59, 4:18. \n107 Id. \n108 PX 32; DX 1 (“All incoming staff will undergo additional training to ensure security within BCCY-WF.”). \nPage 21 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 22 of 64\nOJJ’s TTU program shall be provided a free and appropriate education (FAPE).”109 \nThis Policy identifies a variety of general and special education services that must \nbe provided to youth placed in a TTU.110 \n61. Youth ages ten through eighteen, identified as high-risk, are eligible for placement \nin the TTU.112 \n62. OJJ utilizes a classification system to determine what youth are appropriate for \ntransfer for the TTU.113  Youth are constantly being re-classified to see if they can \n“step down” back into the general population of another facility or be released to \ntheir  homes  and  communities.    OJJ  employs  a  multi-disciplinary  team  to \ndetermine, on a case-by-case basis, if a youth fits the criteria for placement at the \nTTU.  There is no current list of transferees to BCCY-WF because “every day is a \nnew day” for a child to start working their plan.114   \n63. The TTU is only for youth who are an imminent risk for violence, destruction, or \nescape after all de-escalation efforts have been made, unsuccessfully, at a regular \ncampus.115 \n64. The TTU is intended to be a 4-6 week intensive therapeutic program. Youth can \n“work their way out” of TTU by demonstrating ability to thrive in a social living \nenvironment.116 \n65. Sommers testified that the goal of OJJ is to design facilities that facilitate a tiered \ntherapeutic model, but OJJ has historically lacked the funding to accomplish \n \n109 DX 3. \n110 Id. \n112 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:01. \n113 DX 2. \n114 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 11:53-11:56. \n115 Id. at 2:20. \n116 Id. at 11:51. \nPage 22 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 23 of 64\nthis.117  The biggest challenge to creating a tiered system is the lack of the proper \nphysical plant.118  \n66. The existing secure care facilities in Louisiana were “just not built to keep youth \ninside,” and need to be designed  using “correctional construction” materials, such \nas correctional grade sheetrock, etc.119 \n67. The TTU Youth Services Policy provides that all services and programs available \nto youth in all other OJJ secure care facilities will be fully available to the youth at \nBCCY-WF.120 The evidence establishing that all services required by law, by \nLAMOD (where applicable), and TTU policies will be in place at BCCY-WF was \nunrefuted.  \n68. The Court finds that the TTU at BCCY-WF is a temporary solution and will provide \nall necessary programs and services to youth, and the TTU is not designed to be \npunitive but to be therapeutic and rehabilitative while maintaining discipline, safety, \nand security. \n1.  Medical & Mental Health Services \n69. Dr. Denise Dandridge, the Director of Health Services for OJJ is responsible for all \nmedical and mental health services provided by OJJ.121 \n70. OJJ contracts with Wellpath, LLC (“Wellpath”) to deliver medical and mental health \nservices to youth at BCCY-WF.122   \n \n117 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:31.   \n118 Id. at 10:32. \n119 Id. at 10:29, 10:34. \n120 DX 3. \n121 9/6/22 Testimony of Dandridge at 2:23. \n122 Id. at 2:25; DX 50. \nPage 23 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 24 of 64\n71. The scope of Wellpath’s delivery of medical and mental health services was \nextended to BCCY-WF on September 1, 2022.123 \n72. Wellpath has  provided medical and mental health services to OJJ for the last 10-\n11 years; Wellpath is also contracted to provide similar services to juvenile facilities \nacross the country.124  \n73. All OJJ medical providers are hired and employed or contracted by Wellpath; Dr. \nDandridge participates in this process.125 \n74. Wellpath personnel have visited the proposed facility in West Feliciana and are \nconfident they can provide the necessary medical and mental health services at \nthe BCCY-WF site.126 \n75. Mental health counselors will be onsite at BCCY-WF 8 hours a day, Monday \nthrough Friday.  Counselors will be on-call on weekends and nights.  A psychiatrist \nwill be available by telemedicine.127   \n76. A start-up team of experienced mental health providers and nursing staff have \nbeen identified and will be on-site when BCCY-WF opens.128  This start-up team \nwill be onsite until new staff have been hired and fully trained.129 \n77. The goal is for BCCY-WF to have two mental health providers on site.130 \n78. Youth who are transferred to BCCY-WF will receive the same mental health and \ncounseling services as youth in any other OJJ facility.131 \n \n123 Id.  \n124 Id. \n125 Id. at 2:26-2:27, 2:29. \n126 Id. at 2:31. \n127 Id. at 2:36-2:37. \n128 Id. at 2:37. \n129 Id. at 2:38-2:39; 9/7/22 Testimony of Dandridge at 9:15-9:16. \n130 Id. at 2:40, 9/7/22 Testimony of Dandridge at 8:43. \n131 9/8/22  Testimony of Bridgewater at 2:27. \nPage 24 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 25 of 64\n79. OJJ will be adding Trust Based Relational Intervention to BCCY-WF.132  \n80. The medical directors at BCCY-WF will be Dr. Christopher Lee and Dr. Michael \nDay who have a practice in Baton Rouge.133 \n81. OJJ will transport youth in need of medical treatment outside of BCCY-WF.134   \n82. Plaintiffs failed to present evidence or offer legal authority demonstrating that the \ndistance from the nearest hospital renders the level of medical care provided by \nOJJ unconstitutional. \n83. Dr. Dandridge testified that OJJ will likely contract a provider for emergency \ntransport  services;135  however,  according  to  the  MOU,  “LSP  may  provide \nassistance  to  OJJ/BCCY-WF  with  medical  transportation  (ambulance)  to  a \ndesignated emergency room facility in life threatening situations and as safety, \nresources, and regulations permit.”136 \n84. Youth offenders will not be treated with adult offenders.137 \n85. No juvenile will ever be referred to LSP for medical care.138 \n86. Youth at BCCY-WF will have the same access to medical and mental health care \nas in all other OJJ facilities.139 \n87. Youth at BCCY-WF will have the same access to prescribed medications.140  \n \n132 Id. \n133 9/6/22 Testimony of Dandridge at 2:35. \n134 Id. at 2:44. \n135  9/7/22 Testimony of Dandridge at 9:24. \n136 PX 32 at OJJ-000418. \n137 9/6/22 Testimony of Dandridge at 2:42. \n138 9/7/22 Testimony of Dandridge at 9:07-9:08, 9:13. \n139 Id. at 9:08-9:09. \n140 Id. at 9:13. \nPage 25 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 26 of 64\n88. Youth  at  BCCY-WF  will  have  the  same  individualized  and  group  counseling \navailable.141  \n89. No Youth will be transferred to BCCY-WF until all medical and mental health care \nservices are fully available, including the physical spaces to provide such care.142  \n90. The Court finds that the level of medical care, including mental health care, that \nwill be provided by OJJ at BCCY-WF meets the constitutional standard. The Court \nfurther finds that no child at BCCY-WF will receive medical care at LSP. \n2.  Education and Special Education Services \n91. The same education and special education services provided to youth in other OJJ \nfacilities will be provided to youth transferred to BCCY-WF.143 \n92. All youth assigned to OJJ’s TTU program at BCCY-WF will be provided a free and \nappropriate education (FAPE), including special education services.144 \n93. “OJJ’s TTU Program will designate at the minimum 2 special education teachers \nto provide students with disabilities identified by the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (“IDEA”) with any special education instruction as prescribed by the \nstudent’s Individualized Education Program (“IEP”). Related service providers are \nrequired  and  will  be  provided  by  the  Special  School  District  (“SSD”)[;]  the \ncontracted special education provider for the school site is determined by each \nindividual student need and identified in the Bulletin 1508 evaluation and IEP.”145 \n \n141 Id. at 9:13-9:14. \n142 Id. at 9:16. \n143 9/8/22 Testimony of Shenell Deville, generally. \n144 DX 43. \n145 Id. at OJJ-000265. \nPage 26 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 27 of 64\n94. The Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections Youth Services contracts \nwith the Louisiana Special School District to provide education and related services \nto the exceptional populations in OJJ secure care facilities.  This contract sets forth \nthe responsibilities of the State to provide special education services for students \nin unique settings.146  This contract governs all OJJ secure care facilities in the \nstate, including BCCY-WF.147 \n95. There  will  be  no  interruption  of  special  education  services  for  any  student \ntransferred to the TTU at BCCY-WF.150 \n96. If a student in the TTU has an IEP that requires a psychologist, speech therapist, \noccupational therapist, or any other special service deemed necessary by the IEP, \nsuch service/provider will be provided to the student in the BCCY-WF TTU.151 \n97. All special educators who provide education services in the TTU must go through \nspecialized training.152 \n98. The same general education format offered at all other OJJ secure care facilities \nwill be offered at BCCY-WF.153 \n99. The student to teacher ratio at BCCY-WF will be 8 to 1, compared to  the 12 to 1 \nstudent to teacher ratio typical at most other OJJ facilities.154 \n100. The BCCY principal will serve as the principal at BCCY-WF.155 \n101. Teachers at BCCY-WF will be credentialed as required by Louisiana state law.156 \n \n146 DX 44. \n147 9/8/22 Testimony of Deville at 1:12. \n150 Id.at 1:20-1:21. \n151 Id. at 1:23. \n152 Id. at 1:25. \n153 Id. at 1:29. \n154 Id.; DX 45, 46. \n155 Id. at 1:36. \n156 Id. at 1:40; DX 48.  \nPage 27 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 28 of 64\n102. No educational staff will be shared between staff at LSP and staff at BCCY-WF.157 \n103.  All educational services will be ready and available to each student at BCCY-WF \non  day  one;  no  student  will  be  transferred  to  BCCY-WF  until  the  education \ndepartment is fully staffed and trained.158 \n104.  The Court finds that the youth at BCCY-WF will be provided education, including \nspecial education, in accordance with the requirements of federal and state law, \nwithout interruption. \n3.  Food & Recreation Services and Visitation \n105.  Daily meals for BCCY-WF will be prepared by the DOC.  The food will be placed \nin a hot box and transported by OJJ staff from LSP to BCCY-WF.  DOC staff will \nnot transport the food to BCCY-WF, and no inmate trustees will transport food to \nBCCY-WF.159 \n106.  The Recreation and Activity Monitoring Standard Operating Procedure applicable \nto BCCY will apply to BCCY-WF.160 \n107.  The Activity Schedule for BCCY-WF sets forth opportunities for recreation at \nBCCY-WF.161 \n108.  While the designated recreation areas at the facility as of the date of the hearing \nwere sorely lacking, unrefuted evidence submitted at the hearing established that \nOJJ is having concrete poured for basketball courts and is undertaking other \nimprovements to serve recreational needs.162 \n \n157 Id. at 1:50. \n158 Id. at 1:52. \n159 9/8/22 Testimony of Bridgewater at 2:22. \n160 Id. at 2:29-2:30; DX 54. \n161 Id. at 2:31; DX 56. \n162 9/8/22 Testimony of Patin at 4:04. \nPage 28 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 29 of 64\n109.  Sommers vehemently stated that there would be contact visitation at BCCY-WF.  \nHe also testified that OJJ will hopefully be able to offer transportation for parents \nto and from BCCY-WF.163 \n110.  The Court finds that, based on the unrefuted evidence of upgrades that OJJ is in \nthe process of making to the BCCY-WF facility, youth at BCCY-WF will be provided \nconstitutionally adequate meals and opportunities for recreation.  The Court further \nfinds that youth will have the opportunity for contact visitation with family. \nF.  The BCCY-WF Plan - Rehabilitative/Therapeutic Model v. Correctional Model \n111. The Parties in this matter agree that the goal of juvenile justice is rehabilitation, not \npunishment.164 \n112. Vincent Schiraldi was accepted by the Court as an expert in juvenile justice and \ngave opinion testimony to the Court on the appropriateness of Defendants’ Plan \nfor BCCY-WF.165 \n113. Schiraldi explained that the goal of rehabilitation is to provide services, support, \nand opportunities to enable a young person to “matriculate out of delinquent \nbehavior”; punishment is the act of being confined or incarcerated that deprives a \njuvenile of their liberty as a matter of public safety and deterrence to committing \ncrimes.167  \n114. In  Schiraldi’s  opinion,  juvenile  justice  systems  should  not  mirror  adult  justice \nsystems. Youth should not be sent to adult prisons.168 \n \n163 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:39. \n164 9/7/22 Testimony of Schiraldi at 3:38; 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 10:34; 9/8/22 Testimony of \nSommers at 10:23. \n165 Id. at 3:30; PX 11, 12. \n167 Id. at 3:38-3:40. \n168 Id. \nPage 29 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 30 of 64\n115. A  juvenile  facility  should  provide  a  normalized  environment,  to  the  degree \npossible.169 \n116. Schiraldi conceded that, “eventually you may have to restrain a kid, put your hands \non a kid,” but this should be a last resort.171  \n117. Schiraldi toured the proposed BCCY-WF facility in the first week of September \n2022.172 \n118. Schiraldi opined that BCCY-WF is an inappropriate environment for youth because \nit “screams prison.”173  Its atmosphere suggests a correctional model rather than a \nrehabilitative model.174 \n119. The indoor space designated for recreation is inadequate.175 \n120. The existing outdoor recreational space are likewise inadequate, consisting of a \nbasketball goal erected in a grassy area in view of a guard tower.176 \n121. The existing visitation space is a non-contact, mesh screen separating the juvenile \nfrom a visitor.177  \n122. The youth’s living quarters will be prison cells with barred sliding doors that lock \nthem in.178 \n \n169 Id. at 3:49. Schiraldi testified that he had visited BCCY in 2016 and observed that the facility was old, \nbut it had an internal gym, outdoor field and basketball, a vocational building, school building, and dorms.  \n171 Id. at 4:05-4:06. \n172 Id. at 4:24. \n173 Id. at 4:25.  \n174 Id.

Schiraldi also raised the issue of lack of privacy in the open showers (PX 20 at Alex A. – \n000282), but Patin testified that shower curtains have been ordered to correct this issue.  9/8/22 Testimony \nof Patin at 4:05. \nPage 30 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 31 of 64\n123. The nearest hospital in West Feliciana Parish is 24 miles away from LSP, and the \ncontracted hospital is 134 miles away.179 \n124. While Schiraldi opines that the use of adult prison cells as rooms for youth is “de \nfacto” solitary confinement, the Court disagrees for the reasons stated below.  \nSchiraldi  concedes  that  confining  youth  to  their  cells  at  night  is  not  solitary \nconfinement, but it is isolation, and therein lies the psychological harm.180  \n125. Solitary confinement has a very negative affect on young people; it exacerbates \nalready existing mental health problems, it can exacerbate or cause the onset of \nmental illness and depression, and causes an increased risk of suicide.181  \n126. Unlike the situation in OJJ secure care facilities across the Louisiana, Schiraldi’s \nexperiences in renovating juvenile facilities in Washington, D.C. allowed him to \nrenovate a vacant facility while youth were housed elsewhere.  As renovations \nwere complete, the youth would be moved into renovated areas, and renovations \nwould start on the vacated areas.183 \n127. Years ago, both Louisiana and New York consulted with the Missouri Youth \nServices Institute regarding its model for juvenile justice.184 \n128. The Missouri Model for juvenile justice is a therapeutic model; it is not the model \nused by the majority of states in the country.  Further, the Missouri Model is not \nthe only therapeutic model in the United States.  Some states utilize a trauma \ninformed therapy model, and some states utilize a more correctional approach.185 \n \n179 Id. at 4:50. \n180 Id. at 5:00. \n181 Id. at 4:53-4:54. \n183 9/8/22 Testimony of Schiraldi at 8:40-8:42. \n184 9/7/22 Testimony of Schiraldi at 4:19. \n185 9/8/22 Testimony of Schiraldi at 8:42-8:44. \nPage 31 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 32 of 64\n129. Bridgewater, the Statewide LAMOD Coordinator for all OJJ facilities,186 explained \nthat LAMOD is the Louisiana model for juvenile justice, modeled after the Missouri \nmodel.    With  LAMOD,  youth  are  taught  various  social  skills.  The  LAMOD \nphilosophy allows the youth to work in groups, and peer-to-peer interaction is very \nimportant.  Youth are allowed to confront each other and discuss issues.  There \nare four stages of LAMOD, and youth progress from one stage to another while \ncompleting assignments and learning new skills.  The last stage is citizenship, and \nthere are rewards and incentives for completing the stages and learning the \nvarious skills associated with each stage.187  The LAMOD approach is defined as: \n“[a] holistic therapeutic approach to how we engage, work with, and treat youth \nstaff, families and communities.”188 \n130. Schiraldi agreed that rehabilitation of a juvenile is not the only interest served by \nthe juvenile justice system; the safety of youth, staff, and the public are also \ninterests served by the juvenile justice system.189  There must be a balancing of \nthese interests.190 Rehabilitation can many times serve all these interests, but not \nalways.191 \n131. When a youth is acting out violently, one of the last resort options is physical \nrestraint.192 \n132. Nelson believes in the LAMOD therapeutic model and finds it works well for \ncompliant youth that are willing to use the program and adapt; however, LAMOD \n \n186 9/8/22 Testimony of Bridgewater at 2:21. \n187 Id. at 2:27-2:28. \n188 DX 2 at OJJ-0000004. \n189 9/8/22 Testimony of Schiraldi at 8:44. \n190 Id. \n191 Id. at 8:45. \n192 Id. at 8:47. \nPage 32 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 33 of 64\ndoes not work well with aggressive, violent youth that attack staff and peers \nbecause they can freely move around and act out.196 \n133. Nelson testified, “We don’t punish kids placed in our custody.”197 \n134. Sommers stated that the goal of OJJ is “to rehabilitate every kid we get.”198 \n135. Sommers would prefer to use the Missouri model for juvenile justice in every \nsituation but lamented, “you cannot do therapy if a faction of youth are disrupting \neverything.”199 \n136. To the issue of solitary confinement, Nelson testified that, legally, no child can be \nconfined in their room for more than 8 hours and then only after an assessment; \nthe child must be checked on an hourly basis; once the child has calmed down, \nthey are released back into the general population.  Sleeping in your room at night \nis not solitary confinement.200  \n137. As for the photographs of the proposed BCCY-WF site that show that the visitation \narea is that of an adult prison, with a screen separating the offender from a visitor \nand  no  opportunity  for  physical  contact,201  Sommers  testified  that  these \nphotographs do not depict the plan for visitation at BCCY-WF: Visiting through \nplexiglass “is not gonna happen … a momma needs to hug her son … we will have \nthat type of visitation at West Feliciana, no doubt.”202 \n138. The photographs of the facility taken by Schiraldi on September 1, 2022 are, in \nsome instances, shocking and depressing.  However, the Court finds that these \n \n196 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 11:12-11:13. \n197 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 10:34. \n198 9/8/22 Testimony of Sommers at 10:23. \n199 Sommers at 10:31.

The Court finds that OJJ is committed to rehabilitation of youth that will be placed \nin the temporary TTU at BCCY-WF.  The Court further finds that the goal of using \nthe facility on the grounds of Angola is not punishment but rehabilitation in a setting \nthat allows OJJ to deliver therapeutic services while maintaining order, security, \nand safety for all youth in the custody of OJJ.  However, the Court also finds that \nsome aspects of the facility could have harmful psychological effects on youth \nplaced at BCCY-WF. \nG.    Alex A. - Evidence of Harm204 \n140. Alex A. is a seventeen-year-old who has been in the custody of OJJ since May 9, \n2021, and is currently housed at BCCY.205 \n141. Alex A. became aware of the “Angola plan” by overhearing OJJ staff discussions \nand seeing news reports that some youth in OJJ custody would be moved to the \ngrounds of Angola.206  \n142.

Alex A. admitted that he has a history of aggressive behavior and problems with \nanger management,209 and he receives counseling for anger management.210 \n145. Alex A. gets angry when he is told to do things by staff that he does not want to do \nand when other youth annoy him.211  \n146. Alex A. testified that getting angry sometimes makes him “want to kill.” He admitted \nthat  anger  has  caused  him  to  “choke  somebody  [another  youth]  out,”  break \nsomeone’s nose, and he stated he might kill someone if he got angry enough, \nincluding OJJ staff.212   \n147. Alex A. has been treated for a history of anxiety manifested by hair pulling.213 \n148. Many of Alex A.’s fears are based on incorrect assumptions; however, it is not Alex \nA.’s obligation to ask OJJ about the transfer plan, it is OJJ’s obligation to properly \ncommunicate with its youth and their parents.  \n149.

An ideal setting to rehabilitate delinquent youth is therapeutic rather than punitive.  \nThe environment should not be traumatizing.217 \n152.

Dr. Stevens concluded that the psychological impact of Angola’s reputation as a  \nscary  prison  plagued  with  aggression  and  violence  has  resulted  in  serious \nanticipatory stress for Alex A.222 The specter of the move to Angola is traumatic \nand thus harmful to the developing adolescent brain.  \n156.

Placement of Alex A. in a facility designed to house adult inmates will exacerbate \nhis PTSD.224  \n158. The goal of rehabilitation is disserved by re-triggering traumatized youth by placing \nthem in an environment that looks and feels punitive, like LSP.225 \n159. Placing  any  child  in  a  maximum-security  facility  designed  for  adults  is \nunreasonably psychologically harmful to children.226  \n160. The Court finds that there is a high-risk that the placement of adolescents in a \nfacility  designed  to  house  adult  inmates  will  be  psychologically  harmful  and \ntraumatizing. However, the Court finds that OJJ needs to place high-risk youth in \na facility that provides a high level of security, both for the protection and safety of \nhigh-risk youth and all youth in OJJ custody. This finding is validated by Alex A.’s \ntestimony and conduct record. \nIII.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“RA”) \nPlaintiff  claims  that  disabled  youth  will  not  receive  special  education \naccommodations or mental health services at BCCY-WF. The evidence does not bear \nthis out. First, Plaintiff’s RA claim is predicated on a faulty assumption and unproven \nassertion that youth will be placed in the LSP adult prison with adult inmates.  The \nevidence established that no youth will be placed in LSP with adult inmates.  \nSecond, to the extent Plaintiff attempted to show that disabled youths’ special \neducation and mental health needs will not be accommodated at BCCY-WF, Plaintiff \nfailed to carry his burden of showing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. \nPlaintiff’s argument that special education services and mental health services will be \nunavailable or deficient at BCCY-WF went unproven.244 Plaintiff failed to refute the \nevidence establishing that special education services, as well as mental health services, \nwill be provided to youth transferred to BCCY-WF to the same or greater extent and in \nthe same manner these services are provided to all youth in OJJ custody. The evidence \nestablished that there will be increased opportunities for counseling at BCCY-WF, and \nTrust Based Intervention will be an additional therapeutic tool provided at BCCY-WF to \naddress the youth’s particularized needs.245 The evidence established that mental health \nservices will be more robust at BCCY-WF, and there was utterly no showing that special \neducation requirements will be adversely impacted. \n \n244 For example, Plaintiff contends: “If he is denied those services, it will be discrimination on the basis of \nhis disability.”  Rec. Doc. No. 73, p. 16 (emphasis added).  \n245 9/8/22 Testimony of Bridgewater at 2:27, 2:33-2:34. \nPage 40 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 41 of 64\nThird, Plaintiff attempts to amend his Complaint via his post-hearing memorandum \nto add a claim for disability discrimination, claiming that “Defendants’ failure to address \nand accommodate Plaintiff’s non-classroom needs, namely his anxiety and fear related \nto the threatened transfer to Angola, is disability-based discrimination.”246  Plaintiff also \nargues, in conclusory fashion, “Defendants’ failure to provide any information about their \nplans to Plaintiff and other youth at risk of being transferred to LSP, despite knowing that \nthe young people are aware of the impending transfer, constitutes discrimination as well \nbecause it exacerbates his mental health disabilities.”247  These allegations do not appear \nin Plaintiff’s Complaint or in his motion for injunctive relief.  The Complaint alleges a failure \nto accommodate claim under the RA, not disability discrimination.   \nEven if such a claim could be somehow gleaned from Plaintiff's Complaint, there \nwas not a shred of evidence that Defendants intentionally failed to provide youth with \nmental disabilities at BCCY with the details of the plan because of their disabilities.249 \nA disability discrimination claim is not properly before the Court,250 and there has been \nutterly no showing of likelihood of success on the merits of such a claim. \n2.  Section 1983 Constitutional Claims \nPlaintiff claims that Defendants’ plan to transfer youth to BCCY-WF violates his \nFourteenth  Amendment  rights  because  it  subjects  him  to  unlawful  conditions  of \nconfinement, violates his due process rights, and unlawfully constitutes punishment. \n \n246 Rec.

Sept. 20, 2021)(emphasis \nadded). \n250 See Humana Insurance Company v Tenet Health System, No. 3:16-cv-2919-B, 2016 WL 6893629 (N.D. \nTex, Nov. 21, 2016). \nPage 41 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 42 of 64\nPreliminarily, the Court notes the Supreme Court’s holding in Reno v. Flores, that \n“‘the best interests of the child’ is not the legal standard that governs parents' or guardians' \nexercise of their custody: So long as certain minimum requirements of child care are met, \nthe interests of the child may be subordinated to the interests of other children, or indeed \neven to the interests of the parents or guardians themselves.”251   \nIn support of his claims, Plaintiff elicited testimony of “best practices” or prevailing \nindustry standards; however, the Constitution does not require “best practices.” Courts \naddressing the constitutional claims of juveniles in secure care stress this point.   \nIn Alexander S. by and through Bowers v. Boyd,253 the court noted that its role in \nthe  case  was  to  ensure  that  minimally  acceptable  standards  for  treatment  and \nrehabilitation were met by the juvenile justice agency.254   \n[I]t is not necessary that the state provide the best possible services and \ntraining available to the Plaintiffs. The test in this case is whether the state \nis  providing  minimally  adequate  or  reasonable  services  and  training \nnecessary  to  ensure  the  protected  interests  of  the  Plaintiffs.  It  is  not \nappropriate  that  the  state  be  held  to  a  standard  which  imposes  an \naffirmative  duty  to  succeed  in  the  purpose  of  correcting  the  juveniles' \nbehavior.  Although  such  a  standard  may  be  desirable,  it  is  not \nconstitutionally mandated. All that is required is that the juveniles be housed \nunder conditions that provide them with a reasonable opportunity to correct \ntheir behavior. Obviously, this standard incorporates the security, program, \nand service functions that are basic to juvenile corrections.255 \n \nSimilarly,  in  Hughes  v.  Judd,256  the  court  stressed  that  the  juvenile-plaintiffs’ \nattempt to import “best practices” into the constitutional standard was improper:  \nThe Sheriff argues, again convincingly, that the plaintiffs strive to avert the \nConstitution by substituting for the governing constitutional standard an \nimpromptu,  improvised  standard  equivalent  to  “best  practices”  as \n \n251 507 U.S. 292, 304 (1993)(citation omitted). \n253 876 F.Supp. 773 (D. S.C. 1995). \n254 Id. at 798. \n255 Id. \n256 108 F.Supp.3d 1167 (M.D. Fla 2015). \nPage 42 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 43 of 64\nunderstood  at  and  for  the  moment  by  persons  who  are,  in  effect, \nprofessional  advocates  and  critics,  that  is,  persons  other  than  the \ncorrections  and  detention  professionals  whose  professional  judgment \nreceives under the governing constitutional law a strong presumption of \ncorrectness and whose supervision is subject to judicial intervention under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment only in the extraordinary circumstance. Suffice \nto say that, if the Fourteenth Amendment requires intervention into the \nmanagement of the juvenile detention facility that the Sheriff operates at \nCCJ, the Fourteenth Amendment requires a wholesale intervention into \ndetention and incarceration at most of the facilities in the United States, an \nintervention possible only by an unprecedented and precipitous lowering of \nthe constitutional threshold.257 \n \na.  Conditions of Confinement Liability Standard \nPlaintiff maintains that the constitutional standard to be applied in this matter is an \nobjective deliberate indifference standard as discussed in Kingsley v. Hendrickson.268  In \nKingsley, the Supreme Court held that pretrial detainees need only show the objective \nprong of the “deliberate indifference” test in the context of an excessive force claim.   \nDefendants respond that Plaintiff incorrectly relies on Kingsley, which doesn’t \napply to this case.  Defendants contend:  \nThe  Fifth  Circuit  has  expressly  rejected  the  Kingsley  objectively \nunreasonable standard for cases not involving excessive force against pre-\ntrial detainees. See Alderson v. Concordia Par. Corr. Facility, 848 F.3d 415, \n419–20 (5th Cir. 2017) (rejecting one dissenting judge’s invitation to extend \nKingsley). This Court has repeatedly recognized this holding. See Guillory \nv. Louisiana Dep't of Health & Hosps., No. CV 16-787-JWD-RLB, 2018 WL \n1404277, at *8 (M.D. La. Mar. 20, 2018) (“deliberate indifference standard \nremains a subjective one as set out in Hare despite the intervening case of \nKingsley”).269 \nThe Plaintiff’s argument was considered and rejected by another Section of this \nCourt in J.H.v. Edwards:  \n263. Defendants argue that the Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference \nstandard applies, even for actions against juveniles. There is support in the \n \n257 Id. at 1174-1175. \n268 576 U.S. 389 (2015). \n269 Rec. Doc. No. 49, p. 22. \nPage 43 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 44 of 64\nFifth Circuit for this position; indeed, the Fifth Circuit expressly said in \nMorales v. Turman, 562 F.2d 993 (5th Cir. 1977),“The [E]ighth [A]mendment \napplies to juvenile detention centers as well as to adult prisons.” Id. at 998 \nn.1. One reported district court decision within this circuit also followed \nMorales. Vega v. Parsley, 700 F. Supp. 879, 883 (W.D. Tex. 1988) (“The \nFifth  Circuit  has  held  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  applies  to  juvenile \ndetention centers.” (citing Morales, supra)). \n264. Further, while Plaintiffs urge that the “objectively unreasonable” or \n“rational relationship” test discussed by Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. \n389, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 192 L. Ed. 2d 416 (2015), applies, Defendants are \ncorrect  that  the  Fifth  Circuit  has  limited  Kingsley'[s]  “objectively \nunreasonable” standard to cases involving excessive force against \npretrial detainees.” (citations omitted) 270 \nThus, the Court concludes that, in this Circuit, the deliberate indifference standard \napplies to Plaintiff’s conditions of confinement claim which requires proof of both the \nobjective component and the subjective component. \nIn Valentine v. Collier, the Fifth Circuit articulated the proper Eighth Amendment \nstandard to apply in a conditions of confinement case:  \nIn a constitutional claim alleging deliberate indifference to the conditions of \na prisoner's confinement, the plaintiff must satisfy both the “subjective and \nobjective  requirements”  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  inquiry.  Farmer  v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 846, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994). To \nsatisfy the objective requirement, the plaintiff must show an “objectively \nintolerable risk of harm.” Ibid. To satisfy the subjective requirement, the \nplaintiff must show that the defendant: “(1) was ‘aware of facts from which \nthe inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists’; \n(2)  subjectively  ‘dr[e]w  the  inference’  that  the  risk  existed;  and  (3) \ndisregarded the risk.” Cleveland v. Bell, 938 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837, 114 S. Ct. 1970) … The plaintiff must \nshow a denial of “basic human needs.” Ibid. “Deliberate indifference is an \nextremely high standard to meet.” Cadena v. El Paso Cty., 946 F.3d 717, \n728 (5th Cir. 2020).271 \n \n \n270 J.H., 2020 WL 3448087 at *31 (emphasis added). \n271 956 F.3d 797, 801 (5th Cir. 2020). \nPage 44 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 45 of 64\nBoth Valentine and Farmer hold that deliberate indifference requires “a subjective \n‘state of mind more blameworthy than negligence,’ akin to criminal recklessness.”272 Also, \nalthough a court may disagree with a defendant’s actions, “mere disagreement” “does not \nestablish deliberate indifference.”273 \ni.  Objective Component \nPlaintiff alleged the following serious risks of harm in placing youth at BCCY- WF: \n(1) risk of contact between adult inmates at LSP and youth at BCCY-WF, including \npotential  violations  of  the  sight/sound  prohibition  found  in  the  Juvenile  Justice \nDelinquency Prevention Act (“JJDPA“) and the potential assault and sexual assault of \nyouth by adult inmates; (2) risk of loss of or reduction to programs and services at BCCY-\nWF, including education, medical, rehabilitative, mental health, and recreational services \ndue to understaffing; (3) risk that youth will be housed in unfinished and unfit facilities at \nBCCY-WF; (4) risk that DOC staff at LSP will run BCCY-WF; and (5) risk of excessive \nsolitary confinement.274  Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate an objective risk of serious \nharm for the asserted claims. \nThe public policy underpinning the JJDPA is the principle that juvenile rehabilitation \nis undermined by placing juveniles in adult jails or prisons. Best practices counsel against \nhousing juveniles in an adult penal institution. The JJDPA “mandates that incarcerated \nyouths may not be placed in situations in which they have any clear visual or verbal \ncontact that is ‘not brief and inadvertent’ with adult incarcerated persons.”275  The JJDPA \n \n272 Id. at 802 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835, 839–40. \n273 Id. at 803. \n274 Rec.

The \nevidence established that there will be no sight or sound (or any other) contact between \nadult inmates at LSP and youth housed at BCCY-WF.278  \n  There is no evidence that a serious risk of the loss of standard services and \nprograms provided to youth will result from the transfer plan.  The testimony of OJJ \nemployees was consistent and unrefuted that no youth in OJJ custody will be transferred \nto  BCCY-WF  before  the  facility  is  structurally  ready,  adequately  staffed  with  multi-\ndiscipline professionals, and all special education, mental health, and other services are \nin place.279  Deville testified that OJJ is required by law to comply with Louisiana Bulletin \nfor Special Education 1508, which is a guideline for interpreting what disability or disorder \na  student  might  have  that  needs  accommodation.280    Federal  law  requires  this \ndetermination be made within sixty days.281 Thus, by law, OJJ cannot withhold or delay \nspecial education services in any facility. \n \n277 34 U.S.C. § 11133(12)(B). \n278 See generally testimony of Nelson and Patin. Schiraldi, Plaintiff’s expert, admitted that the JJDPA does \nnot prohibit any “rare” or “inadvertent” sight and sound contact that could possibly occur between LSP \ninmates and BCCY-WF youth offenders. \n279 See generally testimony of Nelson, Sommers, Dandridge, Deville, Bridgewater, and Patin. Plaintiff \nquibbles with this argument, noting that Bridgewater admitted that the only LAMOD phases that will be \noffered to youth at BCCY-WF will be morning check-in and morning check-out.  However, Bridgewater \nexplained the reason for this distinction, stating that group counseling can only happen when it is “feasible \nand safe to do so.” 9/8/22 Testimony of Bridgewater at 2:25. Bridgewater further explained that the youth \nsubject to transfer are not amenable to working in a group process.  The youth at BCCY-WF will receive \nindividual counseling and will also be introduced to Trust Based Intervention, a tool not currently used at \nother OJJ facilities. Id. at 2:27. Bridgewater testified at length that there will actually be more opportunities \nfor counseling at BCCY-WF and that any change in modality is based on the specific nature and \ncharacteristics of each child and a determination of how the child can best succeed.  This does not reflect \na decline or removal of a mental health or therapeutic program; rather, it is evidence of a plan to offer \nparticularized treatment to youth in the TTU in a manner that is best for each individual child.   \n280 9/8/22 Testimony of Deville at 1:09-1:10, 1:18. \n281 Id. at 1:21. \nPage 46 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 47 of 64\n  While the photos of the proposed BCCY-WF are disturbing, the testimony was \nunrefuted that much was left to be done to ready the site.282 There is no evidence of a \nserious risk that youth will be transferred to BCCY-WF before it is ready. Despite the \ncondition of the facility on the date the photographs were taken, Defendants presented \nevidence of a clear and detailed plan to complete the facility in a manner sufficient to \nprovide all security, programming, and behavioral intervention needs before the transfer \nof any youth.   \n  Plaintiff’s claim that the DOC would operate BCCY-WF is not supported by any \nrecord evidence.  To the contrary, the record evidence established that the OJJ, not the \nDOC, will be entirely responsible for the operation of BCCY-WF.  According to the MOU, \nthe role of DOC officers at BCCY-WF will be extremely limited, and DOC security officers \nwill provide staffing support at BCCY-WF only upon express request and authorization by \nOJJ. Should DOC staff be utilized at BCCY-WF in any capacity, OJJ will provide training \nto DOC staff on policies and procedures applicable to serving youth populations. There \nis no serious risk that untrained DOC staff will run BCCY-WF.283 \n  There is also insufficient evidence to support Plaintiff’s claim that there is a serious \nrisk of excessive or abusive solitary confinement.  Although youth will be confined to their \ncells while sleeping at night, there was no evidence that OJJ has any intent to unlawfully \nsubject youth to solitary confinement at BCCY-WF.  Nelson testified that, legally, no child \ncan be confined in their room for more than eight hours. Only after an assessment could \nyouth be confined to their room for a longer period; during such time, the youth must be \nchecked on an hourly basis, and once the youth has calmed, they must be released back \n \n282 See PX 20. \n283 See PX 32; DX 1. \nPage 47 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 48 of 64\ninto the general population.  Sleeping in a room, albeit a cell, at night is not solitary \nconfinement.284 \nThe Court does find, however, that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence of a \nserious risk of psychological harm to juveniles by placing them in facilities that were \ndesigned to house adult prisoners. To be clear, the Court is not finding that the facility in \ngeneral poses this risk, and the Court has already found that Defendants proved they \nwere undertaking aggressive measures to clean, paint, repair, and modify the facility.  But \nthe photographs of prison cells, barred sliding doors, open toilets in the cells, guard towers \nand razor wire surrounding the entire facility do, indeed, “scream prison” as Schiraldi \ntestified.285    Dr.  Stevens  testified  at  length  about  the  harmful  psychological  impact \njuveniles could suffer by being housed in a prison facility meant for adults, particularly \nbecause, at under 25 years old, they are cognitively underdeveloped, and they are likely \nalready suffering from a history of trauma.286  Schiraldi testified that using adult prison \ncells as rooms for youth has the effect of solitary confinement because the isolation \ncauses  the  psychological  harm.287    Dr.  Stevens  opined  that  placing  any  child  in  a \nmaximum security facility designed for adults is unreasonably psychologically harmful to \nchildren.288  \nThe fact that there are developmental differences between adult and juvenile \noffenders  has  been  recognized  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Court.  In  Roper  v. \nSimmons, the Supreme Court held that the execution of individuals under 18 years old at \n \n284 9/7/22 Testimony of Nelson at 2:20-2:23. \n285 9/7/22 Testimony of Schiraldi at 4:25. \n286 See generally, 9/6/22 Testimony of Stevens.  \n287 9/7/22 Testimony of Schiraldi at 5:00. \n288 96/22 Testimony of Stevens at 1:28-1:29. \nPage 48 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 49 of 64\nthe time of their capital crimes is prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.289 \nIn making this determination, the Court noted that ‘“[y]outh is more than a chronological \nfact.  It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence \nand  to  psychological  damage.’”290  More  recently,  in  Montgomery  v.  Louisiana,  the \nSupreme Court noted the line of Supreme Court precedent holding certain punishments \ndisproportionate when applied to juveniles.291   \nThe Plaintiff presented objective evidence of a serious risk of psychological harm; \nthus, the Court next considers the subjective component of the deliberate indifference \nstandard. \nii.  Subjective Component \nThe Court finds that Plaintiff failed to present evidence to demonstrate a likelihood \nof success that he could satisfy the subjective component of the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  While it is obvious that OJJ officials are aware of the ages of the youth eligible \nfor transfer and arguably aware of the mental health status of these youth, there is no \nevidence that OJJ officials subjectively drew the inference that housing youth on the \ngrounds of Angola in the designated facility poses a serious risk of psychological harm.   \nFirst, as set forth above, the Court found the OJJ witnesses who testified in this \nmatter to be credible and deeply committed to the rehabilitation of youth in their custody. \nMany of these OJJ employees have invested decades of their professional lives to \njuvenile justice.  Not a single OJJ witness struck the Court as cavalier or dismissive about \n \n289 543 U.S. 551 (2005). \n290 Id. at 569 (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 115 (1982)). \n291 577 U.S. 190, 206 (2016). \nPage 49 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 50 of 64\nthe needs of the youth to be rehabilitated, and none testified in a manner which was \nsuggestive of a vengeful or retaliatory intent in creating this transfer plan.  \nPlaintiff characterizes Nelson as being subjectively indifferent to the needs of high-\nrisk youth because he testified that there are some youth, a small percentage, that will \nnot be rehabilitated, either because they refuse to participate in the therapeutic programs \noffered by OJJ or because of other characteristics of the youth.  But Nelson unequivocally \ntestified that OJJ’s goal is always rehabilitation and never punishment, and OJJ never \nstops trying to find ways to rehabilitate even the most resistant youth.  \nA  wealth  of  unrefuted  evidence  established  that  the  high-risk  youth  have \ncompletely destroyed all secure care facilities in the state.  Sommers testified that OJJ \nhas been renovating these facilities and that the permanent home for the TTU will be in \nSwanson-Monroe in April of 2023. Sommers also explained that OJJ was considering \napproximately five facilities to place youth while these renovations continued.  But, after \nthe July 17, 2022 escape from BCCY-WF, Sommers knew these other potential facilities \ndid not provide the level of security necessary to address the increasingly violent and \ndestructive youth.  It was only then that Defendants began to consider the Reception \nCenter on the grounds of Angola as a facility that, with minimal modifications, could \nprovide a level of security necessary to address this problem.  The evidence shows that, \nsince that time, OJJ has invested considerable time and money to make the Reception \nCenter as appropriate as possible to house the youth and to maintain all services and \nprograms available to all youth in OJJ custody.  There is no evidence to support the \nproposition that OJJ made a “knee-jerk” reaction decision to “send youth to Angola.”  \nPage 50 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 51 of 64\nAccordingly, Plaintiff failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of his conditions of confinement claim.  \nb.  Standard Applied to Punishment of Juveniles \nPlaintiff  also  claims  that  the  facility  itself  is  inherently  punitive  rather  than \nrehabilitative in violation of state and federal law.  It is the public policy of the state of \nLouisiana that commitment of a juvenile to the care of OJJ “is not punitive nor is it in any \nway to be construed as a penal sentence, but as a step in the total treatment process \ntoward rehabilitation of the juvenile[.]”292  According to the Louisiana Supreme Court,  \n“[T]he unique nature of the juvenile system is manifested in its noncriminal, or civil, nature, \nits focus on rehabilitation and individual treatment rather than retribution, and the state's \nrole as parens patriae in managing the welfare of the juvenile in state custody.”293 \nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the United States Supreme Court established that, under the \ndue process clause, “a detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt.”294 \nThe Court also held that a pretrial detainee can demonstrate that he was subjected to \nunconstitutional punishment in either of two ways: (1) by showing “an expressed intent to \npunish on the part of the detention facility officials,” or (2) by showing that a restriction or \ncondition is not rationally related to a legitimate government objective or is excessive in \nrelation to that purpose.295  The Supreme Court in Schall v. Martin applied the Bell \nprinciples for pretrial detainees to juveniles because, like pretrial detainees, juveniles \nhave not been found guilty of a crime.296  \n \n292 La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 15:906(B). \n293 In re C.B., 708 So.2d 391, 396-7 (La. 3/11/98). \n294 441 U.S. 520, 535, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). \n295 Id. at 538–39, 99 S.Ct. 1861; see also Kingsley, 576 U.S. at 398. \n296 467 U.S. 253, 263 (1984).  Courts across the country apply the Bell test to constitutional claims brought \nby juveniles in detention facilities. \nPage 51 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 52 of 64\nThe “expressed intent to punish” prong prohibits an intent to punish a pretrial \ndetainee for the alleged crime for which he is detained.297 It also prohibits officials from \nsubjectively seeking to punish detainees simply because they are detainees,298 or to \nserve  vengeful  or  other  illegitimate  interests.299  However,  this  prong  does  not \n“categorically prohibit discipline imposed by jail officials for infractions committed while in \npretrial detention.”300    \nThe Court finds there is no evidence that OJJ officials “expressed intent to punish” \nthe youth subject to transfer. The Court next considers whether placing high-risk youth at \nBCCY-WF is “rationally related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose and \nwhether [it] appear[s] excessive in relation to that purpose.”301  As the Bell Court made \nclear, “maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are \nessential goals” of a detention facility.302   \nThere is overwhelming evidence in this matter that the transfer plan is rationally \nrelated to a legitimate, nonpunitive governmental purpose. OJJ has an obligation to \nattempt to rehabilitate all youth placed in its custody.  But, as Sommers testified, “you \ncannot do therapy if a faction of youth are disrupting everything.”303  The violent and \ndestructive conduct and the escapes require OJJ to create barriers to the youths’ ability \n \n297 See Bell, 441 U.S. at 535. \n298 See id. at 539. \n299 See Bistrian v.

Id. \nPage 52 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 53 of 64\nto continue this behavior, and BCCY-WF provides those structural barriers and a higher \nlevel of security in general. For example, BCCY-WF has reinforced concrete walls and \nhigh ceilings, making it impossible for the youth to damage the facility, and multiple secure \nfences that will help prevent escapes.  OJJ has an obligation to protect all other youth in \nits custody (and its staff) from the violent attacks that have taken place; transferring youth \nto BCCY-WF allows OJJ to segregate violent youth away from the youth who complain \nthat they cannot sleep at night for fear of being attacked.304 The transfer plan also serves \nthe interests of the high-risk youth because it increases rather than decreases the \nrehabilitative and counseling services available to them. All of these actions qualify as \n“maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline” which “are \nessential goals” of a detention facility. \nThe next question is whether the discipline utilized is excessive. In making this \ndetermination, courts are to keep in mind that jail administrators are afforded “wide-\nranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their \njudgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional \nsecurity.”305  Nevertheless, this deference is not unlimited; a detention facility is not \npermitted to impose conditions that are excessively “harsh ... to achieve objectives that \ncould be accomplished [with] ... alternative and less harsh methods.”306  \nPlaintiff argues that housing youth in a facility designed for adult inmates on the \ngrounds of Angola is “appallingly inappropriate.”307  Initially, the Court agreed. However, \n \n304 Nelson Testimony \n305 Id. at 547. \n306 Id. at 539, n.20. \n307 Rec. Doc. No. 9, p. 25. The Court notes that many of the same alleged risks of harm that formed the \nbasis of Plaintiff’s conditions of confinement claim are also raised here as purported punishment and/or \nexcessively harsh conditions.  Because these claims have already been dispelled, the Court will not repeat \nthem here.  \nPage 53 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 54 of 64\nthe hearing testimony demonstrated that several other options were being considered \nbefore July 17, 2022, and only after that date did the Reception Center enter these \nconsiderations.  The Reception Center was ultimately chosen because it was the only \nbuilding under consideration with the structural construction to address the security and \nsafety issues facing OJJ.  Thus, choosing the Reception Center after the events of July \n17, 2022 was not excessively harsh in response to the legitimate purpose of preserving \ninternal order and discipline and maintaining institutional security; indeed, the evidence \nestablished that it was the only option that could quickly accomplish these goals.  Thus, \nPlaintiff  has  failed  to  demonstrate  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  as  to  his \nunconstitutional punishment/due process claim.  \nc.  Supporting Jurisprudence  \nThe Court finds the following cases analogous and instructive to the issues raised \nby Plaintiff.  \nIn Alexander S., the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina \naddressed  Fourteenth  Amendment  claims  brought  by  juveniles  incarcerated  at  a \ncorrectional institution who challenged their conditions of confinement.308 Plaintiff sued \nthe Department of Juvenile Justice (“DJJ”) challenging a host of conditions similar to \nthose alleged in the instant case:  food, shelter, sanitation, living space, health care, \nrecreation, programs, classification, discipline, and personal safety.309  Regarding the \nneed for discipline in the juvenile detention facilities, the court found:  \nAn  effective  discipline  system  is  necessary  in  a  juvenile  correctional \ninstitution  to  aid  staff  in  controlling  violence  and  other  inappropriate \nbehavior, to maintain safety and security, and to serve as a training tool for \nthe  overall  purpose  of  correcting  the  juveniles'  behavior.  The  Plaintiffs \n \n308 876 F.Supp. 773 (D. S.C. 1995). \n309 Id. at 783. \nPage 54 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 55 of 64\nmount a variety of attacks against the system of discipline in place at DJJ \nfacilities, which depends primarily upon the use of lock-up units and CS gas \nto punish juveniles for disciplinary infractions. The Plaintiffs challenge the \nprocedures by which juveniles are placed in lock-up units and the Spartan \nconditions of the lock-up cells themselves. They also seek to have the court \nimpose a one-hour limitation on the duration of their stay in lock-up facilities. \nThey seek an order of this court imposing “less intrusive and more effective \nmethods of maintaining security and control.” The Plaintiffs also seek to \nhave the court prohibit the use of CS gas altogether.310 \n \nExcept for the DJJ’s use of CS gas, the court determined that the disciplinary \nprocedures at DJJ facilities were not unconstitutional.311  Regarding the use of CS gas, \nthe court took issue not with the fact that it was an option to use, but the fact that it was \nbeing “used on a fairly regular basis … for purposes other than the protection of staff or \nothers.”312  The court concluded that “the indiscriminate use of CS gas violates the \njuveniles' constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause.”313  The court further found \nthat “gas should be used only when a genuine risk of serious bodily harm to another exists \nand other less intrusive methods of restraint are not reasonably available.”314 \nThe plaintiffs also raised the issue of fire safety in the individual cells of the two \nlock-up units with padlocks on all the cell doors.315  The court described these two \n“disciplinary units” at DJJ as having thirty individual cells all secured with padlocks.316  \nBecause each padlock had to be unlocked by hand, the court concluded that this process \ncreated an unreasonable risk of harm to the plaintiffs in the event of a fire.317  Notably, \nthe  court  mentioned  no  constitutional  violations  merely  because  more  aggressive \n \n310 Id. at 785. \n311 Id. \n312 Id. at 786. \n313 Id. \n314 Id.

The juveniles possess a clearly recognized \nliberty interest in being free from unreasonable threats to their physical \nsafety. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315–16, 102 S.Ct. 2452, \n2457–58, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). On the other hand, the general public is \nentitled to reasonable protection from juveniles incarcerated at DJJ. \n \nFor  these  reasons,  juveniles  in  DJJ  facilities  should  be  screened  and \nclassified, so that the aggressive juveniles are identified and separated from \nmore passive juveniles. The level of restraint to be used for each juvenile \nshould be based upon some rational professional judgment as to legitimate \nsafety and security needs. Inherent in this right is a system of periodic \nreview of the initial placement to evaluate whether subsequent events \ndemonstrate  the  need  for  a  reclassification  of  the  juvenile's  security \nrequirements.319 \n \nThe issue of programming was also challenged.  The plaintiffs argued that, with \nproper rehabilitative programming, juveniles would be released faster.  “Because such \nprogramming improves the juveniles' behavior while confined, it reduces the need for \ndisciplinary lock-up and enhances the safety of the institution for the juveniles and the \nstaff.”320  The court found that \n[U]nder the Constitution, a minimally adequate level of programming is \nrequired in order to provide juveniles with a reasonable opportunity to \naccomplish the purpose of their confinement, to protect the safety of the \njuveniles and the staff, and to ensure the safety of the community once the \njuveniles are ultimately released. Minimally adequate program services \nshould be designed to teach juveniles the basic principles that are essential \nto correcting their conduct. These generally recognized principles include: \n(1) taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions; (2) learning \nappropriate ways of responding to others (coping skills); (3) learning to \n \n318 Id. at 787. \n319 Id.

Judd, a case decided by the Middle District of Florida, several \njuveniles, as representatives of other juveniles similarly situated, brought a Section 1983 \naction asserting that Grady Judd, in his capacity as Sheriff of Polk County, Florida, and \nCorizon Health, Inc., a health care provider retained by the Sheriff, violated the juveniles' \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment during the juveniles' detention at the Central \nCounty Jail (CCJ) in Bartow, Polk County, Florida.322  The plaintiffs alleged constitutional \nclaims similar to those asserted in the instant case.  \nIn Hughes, the Sheriff assumed new statutory responsibility for juvenile detainees \nand transferred them from the facility operated by the Department of Juvenile Justice \n(DJJ) to the Juvenile Detention Facility, a self-contained, newly refurbished section of \nCCJ.323  The court found that “the pre-adjudicated juveniles and the direct-file juveniles \nhave lived at CCJ but in separate dorms. The juveniles are separated—out of ‘sight and \nsound’—from the adult inmates, who are housed in a separate building across a large \nfield  at  the  adjoining  adult  campus  of  CCJ.”324    The  plaintiffs  alleged  constitutional \nviolations  based  on  being  housed  on  the  grounds  of  an  adult  prison  and  being \nincarcerated in “an adult model.”  The court rejected this claim: \nThe plaintiffs' claim that CCJ, owing to location and origin, is managed as \nan adult facility. However, the evidence establishes that CCJ is “not run as \nan adult model” but rather “with a juvenile focus or juvenile-specific focus.” \n(XXII  31:12–14)  The  plaintiffs  also  attempt  to  prove,  contrary  to  the \npredominant  and  clearly  convincing  evidence,  that  juveniles  are  left \n“unsupervised” and observed only remotely through cameras, that deputies \ninteract with the juveniles only to physically abuse them, that the deputies \n \n321 Id. \n322 108 F.Supp.3d 1167 (M.D. Fla. 2015). \n323 Id. at 1235. \n324 Id. \nPage 57 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 58 of 64\ndo “nothing” to prevent the “inevitable conflict” between juveniles, that “jail-\nhouse  justice”  rules  apply,  and  that  punishment  is  the  “default.”  The \nevidence soundly refutes each of the plaintiffs' claims, notwithstanding \nseveral episodes to the contrary. Consistent with the Sheriff's constitutional \nmandate to maintain security, safety, and control (XVII 134:20–135:16), \ndiscipline of juveniles occurs only after violation of a facility rule or after \ndisobedience  of  a  detention  deputy's  lawful  order.  Discipline  in  this \ncircumstance is not punishment in the constitutional sense, Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 537, 99 S.Ct. 1861, but is discipline on the “regulation” side of the \n“punitive/regulatory” dichotomy in Salerno and later cases.325 \n \nThe court also reinforced the principle that juvenile detention administrators do not \nviolate the Constitution by utilizing a discipline program to maintain order, safety, and \nsecurity in a detention facility:  \nNonetheless, United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 \nL.Ed.2d 697 (1987), finds that the regime of pre-trial detention codified in \nthe Bail Reform Act of 1984 “is regulatory in nature and does not constitute \npunishment before trial in violation of the Due Process Clause.” 481 U.S. at \n748, 107 S.Ct. 2095. Salerno holds that “the punitive/regulatory distinction \nturns on ‘whether an alternative purpose to which [the restriction] may \nrationally be connected is assignable for it and whether it appears excessive \nin relation to the alternative purpose assigned.’” 481 U.S. at 747, 107 S.Ct. \n2095. Quite obviously, this reasoning directly applies to Florida's system of \ndetention. The management of a detention facility and the preservation \nof safety and security at the facility present a compelling “alternative \npurpose” for regulatory measures, including temporary suspension of \na privilege or the imposition of administrative confinement, however \ndenominated, without implicating the Due Process Clause and without \nrequiring  an  adversary  hearing  before  every  enforcement  of  the \nrules.326 \nC. Irreparable Harm \nHaving found that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on his \nRA and Section 1983 claims, the Motion for injunctive relief fails.  Nonetheless, the Court \nwill analyze the proof on the irreparable harm element. “‘Irreparable harm requires a \n \n325 Id. at 1236. \n326 Id. at 1235 (emphasis added).  \nPage 58 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 59 of 64\nshowing that: (1) the harm to Plaintiff[] is imminent (2) the injury would be irreparable and \n(3) that Plaintiff[] ha[s] no other adequate legal remedy.”’327 A plaintiff seeking injunctive \nrelief: \nmust show that “irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.” \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 \nL.Ed.2d 249 (2008). “[A] preliminary injunction will not be issued simply to \nprevent  the  possibility  of  some  remote  future  injury.”  Id.  (alteration  in \noriginal)  (quoting  Wright  &  Miller,  supra,  §  2948.1);  Morrell  v.  City  of \nShreveport, 536 Fed.Appx. 433, 435 (5th Cir.2013). There must be more \nthan “an unfounded fear on the part of the applicant.” Holland Am. Ins. Co. \nv. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir.1985). Accordingly, the \nparty seeking a preliminary injunction must show that the threatened harm \nis  “more  than  mere  speculation.”  Janvey,  647  F.3d  at  601;  see  also \nConnecticut v. Massachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 674, 51 S.Ct. 286, 75 L.Ed. \n602 (1931) (“[An injunction] will not be granted against something merely \nfeared as liable to occur at some indefinite time in the future.”); Wis. Gas \nCo. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C.Cir.1985) (“[T]he injury must be both \ncertain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.”). Therefore, “[a] \npresently existing actual threat must be shown.” Morrell, 536 Fed.Appx. at \n435 (alteration in original)(quoting United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, \n262 (5th Cir.2001)).328 \n \nFor  the  same  reasons  the  Court  found  that  there  was  a  serious  risk  of \npsychological harm to Plaintiff (and similarly situated youth) due to his age and that he \nsuffers from PTSD and other mental health issues, the Court finds that Plaintiff has \npresented evidence to support the likelihood that psychological harm is imminent upon \nhis transfer to BCCY-WF.   \nTo be clear, the Court does not find that Alex A.’s nightmares, fears, or anxiety \ncaused by his mistaken belief that he would be transferred to LSP to be confined with \nadult inmates constitute irreparable psychological harm.  Alex A. testified that his only \n \n327 J.H. by and through N.H. v. Edwards, 2020 WL 3448087 at *44 (quoting Gonannies, Inc. v. Goupair.Com, \nInc., 464 F. Supp. 2d 603, 608 (N.D. Tex. 2006) (citing Chacon v. Granata, 515 F.2d 922, 925 (5th Cir. \n1975))). \n328 Monumental Task Committee, Inc. v. Foxx, 157 F.Supp.3d 573, 583 (E.D. La. 2016). \nPage 59 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 60 of 64\nconcern about BCCY-WF was the risk of being assaulted by adult inmates. Plaintiff further \ntestified that, if convinced he will not be assaulted by adult inmates, then he will no longer \nbe afraid of a transfer to BCCY-WF.329 \nHowever, Dr. Stevens’ expert opinions did not apply only specifically to Alex A. but \nto any juveniles in state custody based on the lack of brain development in adolescents \nand the likelihood that most incarcerated juveniles are suffering from trauma and/or other \nmental health issues.  Relying on her expertise in juvenile trauma, Dr. Stevens testified \nthat housing juveniles in a facility designed for adult inmates would place these juveniles \nin a defense posture and force them to regulate survival stressors rather than normal, \nappropriate stressors for adolescents, like stress related to their studies. The Court is \npersuaded that transferring emotionally vulnerable adolescents, many of whom have \nmental health issues and cognitive disfunction, to a prison camp on the grounds of Angola \nwill likely have deleterious psychological ramifications. This solution is distressing and not \nwithout consequence. That our society has such a choice to make is emblematic of grave \nunderlying systemic social issues.  \nThe Court’s finding of likely irreparable psychological harm, however, does not \nalone carry Plaintiff’s preliminary injunction burden.   \nD. Balance of Harms \nWhile Plaintiff focuses entirely on the alleged risk of harm to himself and the \npurported class, Plaintiff fails to advance any meaningful argument addressed to the \nserious potential risk of harm that an injunction would cause to Defendants.   \nIn this case, as in Valentine, the State of Louisiana has “assigned the prerogatives” \n \n329 See generally 9/6/22 Testimony of Alex A.  \nPage 60 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 61 of 64\nof  juvenile  detention  policy  to  Defendants,  and  granting  Plaintiff’s  injunction  would \n“prevent  the  State  from  effectuating  the  Legislature’s  choice  and  hence  imposes \nirreparable  injury.”330  As  the  Valentine  court  explained,  the  Supreme  Court  “has \nrepeatedly warned that it is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger \ninterest,  or  one  that  is  more  intricately  bound  up  with  state  laws,  regulations,  and \nprocedures, than the administration of its prisons.”331 The Supreme Court has counseled \nthat the operation of juvenile detention centers is no different. \nThe harm to Defendants if the Court grants the injunction is “particularly acute” \nbecause an injunction would interfere with OJJ’s “system-wide approach” to respond to \nthe changing needs of the youth in its care.332 Issuing an injunction would undermine \nDefendants’ “ability to continue to adjust its policies” by “lock[ing] in place a set of \npolicies.”333 If Defendants are not free to act “without a permission slip from the district \ncourt, … [t]hat constitutes irreparable harm.”334  \nThe youth eligible for transfer to BCCY-WF present a demonstrated risk to other \nyouth in OJJ care, OJJ staff, and when they escape, a risk to the public.  \nThe evidence demonstrated that the TTU program will provide intensified, targeted \nrehabilitative services and therapies to assist the youth who are not responding to OJJ’s \nstandard  programming.  An  injunction  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  the  OJJ’s  TTU \nprogram—\"to  teach  the  youth  to  overcome  their  maladaptive  behaviors,  to  re-enter \ntraditional  OJJ  secure  care  facilities,  and  ultimately  to  return  to  their  homes  and \n \n330 Valentine, 956 F.3d at 803. \n331 Id. (quotations omitted). \n332 Id. \n333 Id. \n334 Id. \nPage 61 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 62 of 64\ncommunities as productive members of society.”336  As Defendants succinctly state: \n“These youth cannot be effectively rehabilitated unless they can first be securely housed \nin a facility such as BCCY-WF (and ultimately, Swanson-Monroe) that allows OJJ staff to \ncontrol and monitor the youth’s activity and prevent the youth from engaging in violence, \nproperty destruction, or escape attempts while their therapy is ongoing.”337 \nAn injunction would subordinate rehabilitative therapies to security enforcement. \nOJJ’s therapeutic and educational programing would become subordinate to providing \nsafety and security from high-risk youth. Housing high-risk youth in a cell block that once \nwas Angola’s death row is far from ideal. However, the Court finds that OJJ has made the \nnecessary  provisions  to  provide  the  youth  subject  to  transfer  to  BCCY-WF  with \nconstitutionally  adequate  care  and  rehabilitative  services.  The  Court  finds  that  the \ninterests of the youth subject to transfer are subordinate to the needs of, and opportunities \nfor, the overwhelming majority of the youth in OJJ’s care who do not pose a security \nthreat. As the Supreme Court held: “So long as certain minimum requirements of child \ncare are met, the interests of the child may be subordinated to the interests of other \nchildren, or indeed even to the interests of the parents or guardians themselves.”338  The \nneeds of this small group of high-risk youth are subordinate to the health, safety, and \nwelfare of the other youth in the program, OJJ staff, and the public. \nThe Court finds that the balance of harms weighs against granting the injunction. \nE.  Public Interest \nPlaintiff  argues  it  is  always  in  the  public  interest  to  prevent  the  violation  of \n \n336 Rec. Doc. No. 74, pp. 15-16. \n337 Id. at 16. \n338 507 U.S. 292, 304 (1993)(citation omitted). \nPage 62 of 64 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 79    09/23/22   Page 63 of 64\nconstitutional rights; however, the Court finds no evidence that Plaintiff’s (or the proposed \nclass’s) constitutional rights would be violated by the transfer Plan.  \nLouisiana has vested OJJ with discretionary authority concerning secure care for \nthe  juveniles  in  its  custody.  The  Constitution  affords  juveniles  in  secure  care  no \nconstitutionally protected interests that outweigh the Defendants’ or the public’s interests \nin the administration of juvenile justice.339  \nThe  public  has  an  interest  in  seeing  adolescents  adjudicated  delinquent \nrehabilitated.  So too, the public has an interest in maintaining public safety.  There can \nbe  no  meaningful  rehabilitation  of  youth  if  OJJ’s  principal  objective  is  reduced  to \nmaintaining order.  As aptly observed by the court in Hughes, “[n]o one wants any of these \njuveniles to be where they are [but] [t]hat some are defiant, aggressive, and enduringly \nturbulent  . . . renders their safe and peaceful management complex.”340 The Court must \nconsider and balance the “many other acute and competing needs of society.”341 These \nyouth deserve more than the circumstances they have endured that have brought them \nto this point. In terms of their secure care, they “deserve and should have more—perhaps, \nquite a bit more—than the constitutionally permissible minimum.”342 Nonetheless, the \nCourt finds that the constitutional minimum is satisfied under the circumstances of this \ncase. \n \n \n \n339 Patterson v.

The Fifth Circuit holds that “[a] district court has wide \ndiscretion in deciding whether to certify a class.”5 Deciding whether a class should be \ncertified “generally involves considerations that are ‘enmeshed in the factual and legal \nissues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action.”’6 “Nevertheless, an evidentiary hearing \non  the  class  certification  issue  is  not  required.”7  As  the  Fifth  Circuit  explained, \n“‘[s]ometimes the issues are plain enough from the pleadings …’ to render an evidentiary \nhearing unnecessary.”8 For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the pertinent \nissues have been sufficiently briefed and supported by the record such that an evidentiary \nhearing is unnecessary. \nI.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nThis case was filed following an announcement by Louisiana Governor John Bel \nEdwards in the summer of 2022 that the Office of Juvenile Justice (“OJJ”) had plans to \ntemporary transfer a small number of youth in OJJ custody to the facility formerly used as \n“death row” on the grounds of the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola.

CLASS CERTIFICATION UNDER RULE 23 \nClass action is the exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and \non behalf of individual named parties only.41  The requirements for class certification are \ngoverned by Rule 23 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  To obtain class certification, \nparties must satisfy Rule 23(a)’s four prerequisites:  \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of that class; and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class.    \n \nAssuming the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs \nmust also establish the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3).42  Plaintiffs seek class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2), which permits certification if “the party opposing the \nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”43  Plaintiffs, as the party \nseeking class certification, bear the burden of demonstrating that the requirements of \nRule 23 have been met.44  “Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.”45  \n \n39 Id. at ¶¶ 10-12, 15. \n40 Id. at ¶ 14. \n41 Ibe v.

Merits \nquestions may be considered to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant \nto determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”51  \nThe proposed class and subclass in this case consist of:   \n[A]ll youth who are now or will be in the custody of OJJ who have been, \nmight be, or will be transferred to the OJJ site (the “Transitional Treatment \nUnit” or “TTU”) at Angola or another adult prison (the “Principal Class”), \nincluding a subclass of all current and future youth with disabilities within \nthe meaning of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in the \ncustody of OJJ who have been, might be, or will be transferred to the OJJ \nsite at Angola or another adult prison (the “Disabilities Subclass”).52 \n \n46 Perry, 675 F.3d at 837 (quoting Castano v.

Under similar circumstances, \nother courts have found numerosity satisfied where “the class is fluid, when ‘the juveniles \nmay by law be incarcerated for varying lengths of time, the [detention] population is \nconstantly in flux, and the proposed class includes future members whose identities are \nunknown.’”64  Further, “parties seeking class certification need not establish at the outset \n \n59 See September 2022 Hearing, DX 3. \n60  Coalition  for  Juvenile  Justice,  Youth  with  Undiagnosed  or  Mistreated  Disabilities, \nhttps://www.juvjustice.org/our-work/safety-opportunity-and-success-project/national-standards/section-i-\nprinciples-responding-2 (last accessed Oct. 28, 2022). \n61 Rec.

It is enough that the Plaintiffs have a \nsubstantial  claim  that”  OJJ’s  “custom,  if  not  its  ostensible  policy”  violates  their \nconstitutional and statutory rights.65  Accordingly, the proposed class and subclass are \nsufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. \nTherefore, the Court finds that the numerosity requirement is satisfied for both the \nPrincipal Class and the Disabilities Subclass. \nCommonality & Typicality66 \nThe Supreme Court, in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, further defined the contours \nof the “rigorous analysis” required by Rule 23.67  Under Wal-Mart, “[w]hat matters to class \ncertification…is not the raising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but, rather the \ncapacity of a class wide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the \nresolution of the litigation.  Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the \npotential to impede the generation of common answers.”68  \nThe Wal-Mart decision has heightened the standards for establishing commonality \nunder  Rule  23(a)(2),  demanding  more  than  the  presentation  of  questions  that  are \ncommon to the class “because any competently crafted class complaint literally raises \ncommon questions.”69 Furthermore, members of a proposed class do not establish that \n“their claims can productively be litigated at once,” merely by alleging a violation of the \n \njuveniles who will be detained at the Broome County Jail, precisely the sort of revolving population that \noften makes joinder of individual members impracticable.”)). \n65 Id. at 588-89. \n66 The Court addresses these requirements together because, as the Supreme Court observed, “[t]he \ncommonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.” Wal-mart, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5 \n(quoting General Telephone Co. of Southwest v.

Even an instance \nof injurious conduct, which would usually relate more directly to the defendant’s liability \nthan to the claimant’s damages, may constitute ‘the same injury.’”74   \nAs to typicality, “Rule 23(a) requires that the named representatives’ claims be \ntypical of those of the class.”75 Prior to Wal-Mart, the typicality test was “not demanding.”76  \nThe extent to which Wal-Mart changed the threshold for typicality in unclear.

Further, the \ndisability subclass challenges OJJ’s failure to have a system in place to accommodate \ndisabled children placed at BCCY-WF.

Further, the existence of factual variations within a proposed class does not \nnecessarily destroy commonality.83 The commonality requirement is satisfied as long as \nthe class’s common questions are “dispositive of their claim and the claim arises out of a \nsingle course of conduct and on a single theory of liability.”84   For example, “[c]ourts \nregularly certify classes of inmates who are disabled, even if they do not have the same \ndisability.”85   \n  The Court finds that the allegations and evidence submitted in this case clearly \nsatisfy commonality and typicality as the challenged policies and practices pose several \ncommon questions of fact and law as set forth above.

(For example, it is undisputed that every youth transferred \nfrom a state secure care facility to BCCY-WF will spend their first 24-72 hours in cell \nrestriction.) Thus, the alleged exposure of the entire class and subclass to the identified \npolicies  is  capable  of  class-wide  resolution  under  Rule  23,  and  there  are  common \nresolutions that would answer these common questions across the board. \nAdequacy of Representation \nNext,  Plaintiffs  must  demonstrate  that  they  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the \ninterests  of  the  class.86  “The  ‘adequacy’  requirement  looks  at  both  the  class \nrepresentatives and their counsel.”87 In determining this requirement, the Court must  \nconsider the (1) zeal and competence of representatives’ counsel; and (2) willingness \nand ability of representatives to take an active role in controlling litigation and protecting \nthe interests of absentees.88 This initial determination of a representative’s adequacy \n“should be based on two criteria: first, the representative must have common interests \nwith  the  unnamed  members  of  the  class;  and  second,  it  must  appear  that  the \nrepresentative  will  vigorously  prosecute  the  interests  of  the  class  through  qualified \ncounsel.”89  To satisfy the adequacy requirement, “there must be no significant conflict of \ninterest between the named plaintiffs and the absent class members.”90 \nDefendants primarily argue that the Named Plaintiffs are not adequate class \nrepresentatives because they have failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  However, \nthe Court already determined that Alex A. exhausted his administrative remedies. In \n \n86 Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4). \n87 Jenkins v.

Cook,  the  Fifth  Circuit  held  that  exhaustion  of  remedies  by  one  named \nrepresentative plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the requirement for the class.91  To the extent \nDefendants argue Charles C.’s claims have not been exhausted, since he was not at \nBCCY-WF at the time he filed his ARP and Amended Complaint, the Court finds that there \nis evidence in the record that may support the allegation that Charles C.’s fears about \nBCCY-WF materialized.  Like Alex A., Charles C. alleges he is “worried, scared, and \nanxious about being sent to Angola, and has had trouble sleeping because of this,” and \nhe “is concerned about being locked in a cell most of the time if he is moved there.”92  All \nNamed Plaintiffs allege that BCCY-WF is not equipped to provide for their educational, \nrehabilitative, mental health, and recreational needs.93    \nAfter  Charles  C.  was  transferred  to  BCCY-WF,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Motion  for \nPreliminary Injunction wherein Charles C. claims, inter alia, that he is routinely subject to \nsolitary confinement, receives almost no teaching  or instruction, and that  counseling, \nmental health treatment and recreation are inadequate.94   These are the same issues \nNamed Plaintiffs have complained of and feared since the inception of this litigation; thus, \nthe Court finds them within the scope of the pleadings.  As the Fifth Circuit explained in \n \n91 376 F.3d 323, 330 (5th Cir. 2004)(citing Oatis v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 398 F.2d 496, 498–99 (5th \nCir.1968) (exhaustion of remedies requirement satisfied for class action if named plaintiff representing class \nexhausted remedies); 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

In Plaintiffs’ recent Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs raise claims that \nhave not been exhausted and do not constitute “grievances about the same issue,” i.e., potable drinking \nwater and heat on the tiers.  However, the exhaustion of these “new” claims is irrelevant for purposes of \ndetermining class certification and will be addressed at the appropriate time.  \nPage 16 of 21 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 243    08/31/23   Page 17 of 21\nJones v. Jones, in some circumstances, “prisoners need not continue to file grievances \nabout the same issue.”95  \nAlternatively, the Court finds that OJJ’s grievance process, even as amended in \nDecember 2022,96 provides no available remedy with respect to certain grieved issues.  \nBoth Alex A. and Charles C. filed ARPs noting their fears of being transferred to BCCY-\nWF where they believed they would be locked in cells for long periods of time. The current \nrecord before the Court establishes that it is OJJ’s official policy to utilize cell restriction \nat the TTU, and every youth transferred to BCCY-WF will face cell restriction for the first \n24 to 72 hours, with no exceptions. Given this official policy that applies to all youth \ntransferred to BCCY-WF, the Court finds there is no available remedy via OJJ’s grievance \nprocess for such a complaint.   \nThis issue is similar to that addressed by the Court in Howard v. Ashcroft, where \na claimant brought suit against the United States based on the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ \n(“BOP”) wholesale policy change regarding the placement of a certain class of convicts \ndirectly  into  community  corrections  centers.97    The  BOP  officially  changed  its \ninterpretation of its discretion to place certain inmates into community correction centers \nand  informed  convicts  housed  in  community  correction  centers  that  they  would  be \n \n95 385 F.3d 503, 521 (5th Cir. 2004)(citing Sulton v.

While the Government is correct that the exhaustion doctrine normally \nbars direct resort to the courts, that is not true where pursuing administrative \nremedies would be futile, “because it is clear that the claim will be rejected.” \nWhere an agency has adopted a new rule or policy and announced that it \nwill follow that policy, especially where that policy has its origin above the \nBureau's General Counsel Office, it is pointless to require a complainant to \nfollow the administrative procedure.100 \n \nThe Court acknowledged that the plain language of the PLRA “destroy[s] the futility \nexception in some cases,” but it also found that “where a petitioner not only is unable to \nprevail by going through the proper procedures as a matter of plain agency policy, but by \ndoing so would be completely deprived of any hope of relief, the exhaustion requirement \nunder the PLRA does not bar relief in the courts.”101  For the same reasons, the Court \nfinds, alternatively, that OJJ’s grievance policy provides no relief for mandatory cell \nrestriction complaints.  \nTurning back to the adequacy requirement, the Court finds no conflict of interest \nbetween the Named Plaintiffs and putative class members, and the record demonstrates \nthat the class representatives have common interests with the unnamed members.  All \nclaims implicate OJJ’s policies and practices at BCCY-WF, which apply to all potential \nclass and subclass members.

This requires a showing that “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting  the  class  as  a  whole.”    “Rule  23(b)(2)  certification  is  available  if  three \nrequirements are satisfied: (1) class members must have been harmed in essentially the \nsame way; (2) injunctive relief must predominate over monetary damage claims; and (3) \nthe injunctive relief sought must be specific.”105 Further, “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when \n \n102 Fed.

It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would \nbe entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.”106  \nThis requirement is easily met based on the findings above.  This case is suitable \nfor certification under 23(b)(2) because Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' policies and \npractices generally applicable to class and subclass members operate to violate their \nrights under federal and state law; thus, the issuance of injunctive and/or declaratory \nrelief, if warranted, is appropriate in this case.  The Plaintiffs have been allegedly harmed \nin purportedly the same manner, i.e. the threat of transfer to BCCY-WF as a form of \npunishment where transferees’ constitutional and statutory rights will be violated, or for \nthose transferred, the actual alleged violation of those rights.  Without question, injunctive \nrelief predominates over money damage claims.  Finally, the injunctive relief requested is \nvery specific.  Plaintiffs request that the Court:  \nB.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants  are  violating  Named \nPlaintiffs’  and  class  members’  constitutional  rights  (and,  for  proposed \ndisability subclass members, federal statutory rights) by transferring them \nto the OJJ site at Angola where they will not receive lawful conditions of \nconfinement,  counseling,  education,  other  rehabilitative  services,  and \nsufficient safety from adults incarcerated at LSP; [and] \nC.  Issue  a  preliminary  injunction  and  permanent  injunction,  requiring \nDefendants to cease plans to transfer Plaintiffs and class members to the \nOJJ site at Angola, and to immediately release to the community or transfer \nPlaintiffs and any class members who have already been moved to the OJJ \nsite at Angola back to one of OJJ’s pre-existing secure care or other \nfacilities[.]107 \n \n \n106 Wal-mart v.Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360. \n107 Rec.

According to \nOJJ, “[y]outh in residential [(non-secure group homes)] and secure care facilities have the same \nrights,” and “[i]t is the state’s duty to act as a parent to the youth placed in custody.”2 OJJ recognizes \nthat “the purpose of incarcerating juveniles . . . is treatment and rehabilitation, [and] due process \nrequires that the conditions and programs . . . must be reasonably related to that purpose.”3 \n5. \nA normalized physical environment is critical to achieving the rehabilitative purpose of \n \n2 Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice, Louisiana Laws, https://ojj.la.gov/policies-systems/louisiana-laws/ (last accessed \nOct. 23, 2022).   \n3 Id.

Casey Foundation (Casey \nFoundation), an organization that focuses on improving the lives and wellbeing of children, \nincluding children in the juvenile justice system, and works closely with states, one of the principles \n“that every juvenile justice system should embrace right now” is to have a physical space and \nenvironment with “natural light, inviting and warm color schemes and pictures” and “[i]n place of \ngray walls, windowless rooms and caged-in recreational spaces typical of many correctional \ndesigns, secure settings [for children] would include places to relax and learn and separate space for \ntherapeutic conversation.”4 The Casey Foundation’s 2014 update to its Juvenile Detention Facility \nAssessment, a guide to juvenile detention reform, states that “[j]uvenile detention facilities should \nnot look like or be operated as jails.”5 These concepts are not new: in 1980, the Institute of Judicial \nAdministration-American  Bar  Association  (IJA-ABA)  Joint  Commission  on  Juvenile  Justice \nStandards (the “IJA-ABA Commission”) issued a set of standards and recommendations, instructing \nthat “[t]he princip[al] value that pervades these standards is the concept of normalization: that \nyouths, at whatever stage of the pre- or post- adjudicative process, should lead lives as close to \nnormal as possible.”6 As the IJA-ABA Commission explained, “[n]ormalization . . . points out that \nbuilding design should not be a source of punishment.”7 \n6. \nThe need for a normalized, rehabilitative, and non-punitive environment is a core reason \nDefendants’ decision to transfer youth in OJJ custody to the grounds of Angola Prison is dangerous \nand unlawful.

Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act (Pub. L. No. 93-415), 42 \nU.S.C. § 5601 et seq. The U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention (OJJDP) has similarly taken the position that “[c]hildren do not belong in adult courts, \njails, and prisons.”8 The JJDPA requires that youth not be confined in any institution where they \nmay have contact with adult inmates; if ever youth are held in adult facilities under temporary and \nexceptional circumstances, there must be “sight and sound separation” from incarcerated adults. \nThe requirement of “sight and sound separation” prohibits contact between children and adults “in \norder to protect [children] from threats or abuse from adult offenders,” and is defined as “any \nphysical, clear visual, or verbal contact that is not brief and inadvertent.”9 \n7. \nAt LSP, adult prisoners perform much of the maintenance of the grounds, food service, and \nother jobs on the property. In the recent past, adult prisoners have maintained the grounds around \nthe building where OJJ is housing children. \n8. \nEven with a strip of black fabric around the fencing surrounding the OJJ Angola site, there \nis a risk of sight and/or sound contact between youth in OJJ custody and adult prisoners incarcerated \nat LSP. \n9. \nPotential contact between incarcerated adults and children housed at the OJJ Angola site \n \n8 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP Priorities: Treat Children \nas Children https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/about/ojjdp-priorities#treat-children-as-children (“Children do not belong in adult \ncourts, jails, and prisons.”) (last accessed Sept. 2, 2022).   \n9 Coalition for Juvenile Justice, JJDPA Reauthorization: Updated Protections to Ensure Equity for Youth, Sep. 23, \n2019, https://www.juvjustice.org/blog/1138. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 5 of 41\nposes a substantial risk of harm to the children and has already caused anticipatory harm to children \nwho might be moved to the site. \n10. \nThe physical features of the Angola prison complex are typical of a maximum-security adult \nprison. These features, which children moved there and their families when they visit will see, \ninclude high fencing topped by multiple layers of razor wire, tall guard towers looming over the \nbuilding and yard designated for recreation for youth in OJJ custody, signage about weapons check-\nins, and signage indicating one is entering the Louisiana State Penitentiary on the way into the \ngrounds. \n11. \nThe OJJ site at Angola is in a building designed for and formerly used as the death row unit \nfor adult men. That building is located on the grounds of LSP, and as such, is surrounded by high \nfences, razor wire, guard towers, and other features that characterize maximum-security adult \nprisons.  \n12. \nIt is well known in Louisiana that Angola is a maximum-security adult prison that houses \nmen convicted of the most serious crimes, including those on death row. It is also well known in \nLouisiana that Angola is notorious for human rights abuses of adults incarcerated there. \n13. \nThe correctional, punitive environment in the building OJJ is using to house youth, designed \nas a death row building in an adult prison, is inappropriate and dangerous for children. Unlike \ndormitories or individual rooms where youth adjudicated delinquent normally live, including those \nin secure facilities, in the adult prison building at Angola, youth are forced to live in barred-door \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 6 of 41\ncells designed to house adults. The cells have no windows and only a single cot, a metal shelf, and \na metal sink and toilet without a toilet seat. These cells deprive youth of any modicum of privacy \nand normalcy, and create an increased risk of solitary confinement, suicide, and self-harm for youth \nliving there.  \n14. \nThe Defendants’ decision to transfer youth in OJJ custody to Angola creates an unreasonable \nrisk of harm for youth who have been or will be moved there because of the adult correctional design \nand environment; the heightened risks of solitary confinement, suicide, and self-harm; lack of \nadequate  access  to  medical,  educational,  and  rehabilitative  services,  including  inadequate \naccommodations for youth with disabilities; and the risk that sight and sound separation will not be \nmaintained.  \n15. \n  On July 19, 2022, at a press conference called to address the failings of the Bridge City \nCenter for Youth (BCCY), an OJJ secure care facility, Defendant Edwards declared that the State \nwould “temporarily move” youth from BCCY to a facility on the grounds of LSP (“the OJJ site at \nAngola”). Although Governor Edwards claimed that the youth would be held in a separate location \nat LSP, would not have any contact with adults incarcerated at LSP, and that youth transferred to the \nOJJ site at Angola will have counseling, educational programming, and other services, those claims \nwere unsupported by any public plan. Since the Governor’s July announcement, Defendants have \nacknowledged that youth in any OJJ facility––and not just BCCY––are at risk of being moved to \nthe OJJ site at Angola if they satisfy certain criteria set by OJJ. On October 19, 2022, OJJ moved \neight youth––four from Acadiana Center for Youth at St. Martinville and four from Swanson Center \nfor Youth at Monroe–– to the OJJ site at Angola. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 7 of 41\n16. \nAlmost five thousand men are incarcerated at LSP, making it the largest adult maximum-\nsecurity prison in the country. LSP is commonly referred to as “Angola” because of its origins as a \nplantation where people were enslaved before the Civil War, when it was called the “Angola \nPlantations.” Given that 83 percent of youth in OJJ’s secure juvenile care system are Black, it is \nhighly likely that Black youth will disproportionately suffer the brunt of the Governor’s plan to \ntransfer youth in OJJ custody to the site at Angola. \n17. \nLSP has a long history of abuse and human rights violations, continuing to this day. In July \n2020, four supervisory correctional officers at LSP pleaded guilty and/or were convicted for beating \nan adult incarcerated at LSP who was handcuffed, shackled, and not resisting.10 As described further \nbelow, LSP officers who normally work with adults at LSP are authorized under Defendants’ policy \nto provide security assistance at the OJJ site at Angola. The prison also cannot provide basic medical \ncare for the adults within its gates. In March 2021, Chief Judge Shelly Dick of this Court concluded \nthat “LSP lacks the infrastructure necessary to provide a constitutionally adequate health care system \nfor patients with serious medical needs,” and “overwhelming deficiencies in the medical leadership \nand administration of health care at LSP contributes to these constitutional violations.”11 Given the \nlikely interactions between youth in OJJ custody at Angola and adult corrections workers and the \nrisk that youth at the OJJ Angola site might receive medical care at LSP in cases of emergency, \nyouth moved to Angola will face significant threats to their safety, health, and wellbeing in this \n \n10 Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs, Four Supervisory Correctional Officers at Angola Prison Sentenced \nfor Beating a Handcuffed and Shackled Inmate, Jul. 6, 2020, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-supervisory-\ncorrectional-officers-angola-prison-sentenced-beating-handcuffed-and.  \n11 Lewis v.

As \none former top OJJ official noted, the move to transfer youth from juvenile facilities to the OJJ site \nat Angola is “abhorrent” and “the worst juvenile justice policy decision probably ever made in \nmodern times.”12 \n19. \nAdult staff working in the OJJ site at Angola will be able to see youth while they are  \nchanging their clothes and/or using the toilet in the cells in which they are confined. The bars, \ninstead of doors, create an increased risk of suicide and self-harm because of the numerous “cut-\noff” points presented by the bars where youth could tie a sheet or shoe string or comparable item. \n20. \nAlthough the site where youth will be held at Angola will be staffed in part by OJJ staff, \nyouth held at the OJJ site at Angola will be exposed regularly to adult corrections staff. Department \nof Public Safety and Corrections (DOC) staff are also authorized to provide security inside and \noutside the OJJ site at Angola. OJJ’s Curtis Nelson testified that DOC staff will be assigned to be \n“roving” throughout the building used by OJJ and will intervene to provide security whenever OJJ \nrequests it. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between OJJ and DOC, DOC \nguards are authorized to use the same force they are trained to use against adults at LSP––including \ndeploying pepper spray and using tasers––against youth at the OJJ site at Angola. \n \n12 Erin Einhorn, Teens in a Louisiana juvenile facility are being sent to Angola prison. Experts say it’s not only cruel, it \ncould violate the law, NBC News (Jul. 21, 2022), https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-sending-youth-\nangola-prison-rcna39150.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 9 of 41\n21. \nUnder Louisiana law, youth in OJJ custody are adjudicated delinquent, which is a civil-law \nadjudication. Plaintiffs and putative class members have not been convicted of any crime. They are \nin juvenile custody for the sole purpose of rehabilitation, and the State is prohibited under the \nFourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution from subjecting them to punishment. Transferring \nyoung people in OJJ custody to the OJJ site at Angola, an infamous prison with thousands of people \nconvicted of crimes under Louisiana law and sentenced to hard labor, is clearly punishment. \nDefendants’ unconstitutional actions place Plaintiffs and putative class members at risk of grave \nharm and lifelong trauma. \n22. \nThe harms of Defendants’ actions are exacerbated for Plaintiffs and putative class members \nwho have disabilities. Plaintiffs Alex A., Brian B., and Charles C. each have a disability as defined \nunder Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They \nseek to represent a subclass of all class members who have a disability, as defined under federal law \n(“Disability Subclass”). As people with disabilities, Plaintiffs and the Disability Subclass members \nare entitled to reasonable modifications, nondiscrimination, and equal access. This includes a right \nto modifications and accommodations in their education, housing, behavior and treatment plans, \nand other aspects of life in OJJ custody. OJJ must consider whether any general policies, systems, \nand procedures that it creates or applies uniformly have the effect of discriminating against or \nexcluding students with disabilities. If so, it must make changes to these policies to ensure equal \naccess and avoid such discrimination.  \n23. \nGiven that a disproportionate number of youth in OJJ’s custody are youth with disabilities, \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 10 of 41\nit is highly likely that youth with disabilities are at risk of being sent to the OJJ site at Angola. The \ncriteria for referring youth in OJJ custody to the Angola site consist chiefly or solely of bad \nbehaviors. Youth with mental health disabilities who are not provided appropriate services and \nsupports face an increased risk of being sent to the Angola site. \n24. \nYoung people with disabilities are overrepresented in juvenile justice system, with an \nestimated 70 percent of children in juvenile justice systems nationwide having disabilities. The OJJ \nsite at Angola is not equipped to provide minimally adequate care and education for any children, \nand even less so for children entitled to educational, behavioral, and housing accommodations, and \nin need of intensive therapeutic and mental health services, as a result of their disabilities. Youth \nwith disabilities are thus likely to suffer disproportionately if sent to Angola. Despite holding in \ncustody a majority-disabled population, OJJ is failing to take disability into account in using the \nAngola site, including in assessing or modifying its selection criteria or transfer process for \nplacement at Angola. By ignoring disability, OJJ is violating disability rights laws.   \n25. \nYoung people who are the target of Defendants’ commitment to transfer youth to the OJJ \nsite at Angola, including Plaintiffs and putative class members, are experiencing anxiety, fear for \ntheir safety, and exacerbated disability symptoms as a result of Defendants’ transfer plan.  \n26. \nBecause  Defendants’  actions  constitute  ongoing,  systemic  violations  of  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional and statutory rights, Plaintiffs seek classwide relief  enjoining Defendants from \ntransferring youth to the OJJ site at Angola or on the grounds of any other adult prison. In addition, \nPlaintiffs request that any youth who have already been transferred to the OJJ site at Angola be \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 11 of 41\nimmediately released to the community or transferred to one of OJJ’s other existing facilities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n27. \nThis action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution, and, for Plaintiffs and putative class members with disabilities, under \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1343 and 2201. \n28. \nVenue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the events and omissions giving rise to \nthese claims occurred and continue to occur in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n \n29. \nPLAINTIFF ALEX A. is a 17-year-old currently under juvenile court jurisdiction. He is \ncurrently in the secure custody of Defendant SOMMERS and OJJ, at BCCY, where he participates \nin  LAMOD,  the  Louisiana  Model  for  Secure  Care,  and  is  not  involved  with  the  Juvenile \nUnderstanding and Managing Problematic Behavior Program (JUMP) Sexual Treatment Units \nprogram. Alex A was deemed eligible by OJJ for transfer to the OJJ site at Angola. He has been \ninformed repeatedly by OJJ staff that he, along with other youth in OJJ custody, will be transferred \nto the OJJ site at Angola imminently. \n30. \nWhile at BCCY, Alex A. attends school every weekday for five hours, during which he takes \nsocial studies, math, English, and science. He has different teachers and changes classrooms for each \nsubject. As a student with a disability, he receives classroom accommodations to help him access \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 12 of 41\nmaterial in the classroom, including the use of a calculator and read aloud services. He also has the \nassistance of a special education teacher in his classes who helps to deliver his services. In addition to \nschool, he is provided with opportunities to explore his hobbies by reading at the library and \nexploring books about sports and life in the city. He receives intensive counseling and treatment \nservices at BCCY, including participating in group counseling three times a week for an hour, \nindividual counseling for at least thirty minutes twice a week, and meeting every two weeks with a \nsocial worker to discuss skills like coping and anger management. \n31. \nAlex A. is a child with a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and under \nthe ADA. He has been diagnosed with a learning disability, and post-traumatic stress disorder and \nhas been prescribed medication to address his PTSD, to help him sleep, and to address nightmares. \n32. \nAlex A. first learned that he and his peers would be moved to the OJJ site at Angola while \nwatching television news at BCCY. Since then, he has experienced significant mental and physical \nharm, including increased difficulty sleeping, extreme stress, and an exacerbation of his disabilities. \nDuring sleepless nights, he has started to pull out his hair. Alex A. fears that he will be subjected to \nunsafe conditions and violence at the OJJ site at Angola. At BCCY, DOC staff have been brought \nin to assist with security due to OJJ staffing shortages. DOC staff at BCCY have used mace and \npepper spray on Alex A. and other youth at the facility. As a result, Alex A. is afraid this violence \nand use of force by DOC staff will only intensify at the OJJ site at Angola, where DOC staff per the \nMOU with OJJ are explicitly authorized to use the force they are trained in using against adults at \nLSP against youth at the OJJ site at Angola. Additionally, Alex A. fears that he will not receive the \ntreatment, counseling, and education that he needs and receives at BCCY. Like Alex A., his peers \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 13 of 41\nare also terrified of being moved to the OJJ site at Angola. Alex A. has seen his peers break down \nand cry because of their fear of being moved there. \n33. \nIn July 2022, when Alex A. first learned of the decision to move BCCY youth to Angola, \nBCCY employees informed him that he would be moved within a week or two. Later, BCCY staff \ninformed him that he and his peers would be moved to the OJJ site at Angola on August 15 or August \n16, 2022. When that did not happen, staff members told him that he would be moved “any day now.” \nBased on these representations, Alex A.  reasonably believes that the move is imminent and could \nhappen at any time. \n34. \nAlex A.  filed an Emergency Grievance pursuant to OJJ’s Administrative Remedy Procedure \n(ARP) on Tuesday, August 16, 2022. Despite the imminent nature of Alex A.’s anticipated move \nto the OJJ site at Angola and the serious physical and psychological harm Alex A. is already \nexperiencing as a result, OJJ responded on August 18, 2022 by stating that Alex A.  is “not subject \nto any immediate risk of harm” and therefore his ARP would be reviewed “within the regular ARP \ntime limits.”  OJJ’s failure to properly treat Alex A.’s grievance as an emergency grievance that \nrequires an expedited timeline has made the grievance process unavailable to Alex A. As a result, \nAlex A. has exhausted all available administrative remedies and represents the class in this action. \n35. \nAlex A. brings his lawsuit through his mother and next friend, Molly Smith, who is an adult \nresident of the state of Louisiana.  Molly Smith brings this action on Alex A.’s behalf pursuant \nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2). Ms. Smith is dedicated to the best interests of Alex A. and will advocate \nfor those best interests in this action. Like her son, Ms. Smith is deeply concerned about Defendants’ \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 14 of 41\nimminent plan to move youth to the OJJ site at Angola. Ms. Smith is terrified that her son will be \nlocked in a windowless cell for 24 hours a day, or that he will be exposed to adults who are \nincarcerated at the OJJ site at Angola.  She is also concerned that Plaintiff will be deprived of the \neducation, medical and mental health treatment, and rehabilitative services he requires when he is \nmoved to the OJJ site at Angola. \n36. \nPLAINTIFF BRIAN B. is 18 years old. He is currently in the secure custody of Defendant \nSOMMERS and OJJ, at the Bridge City Correctional Center for Youth (BCCY). Brian B. was a \nminor when he was charged with juvenile delinquency and turned 18 while his case was pending. \n37. \nBrian B. participates in the LAMOD program at BCCY. He is currently assigned to Liberty \nDormitory at BCCY.  \n38. \nBrian B. learned about the plan to move youth from BCCY to Angola from the news and \nwas shocked and confused to learn he was one of the youth being moved.  \n39. \nPrior to his arrival at BCCY on or around April 20, 2022, Brian B. was hospitalized  twice \nat mental health facilities. Each hospitalization was due to a mental health crisis and each stay lasted \nabout a week.  \n40. \nBrian B. is a youth with a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the \nADA. He has been prescribed medication, including Adderall, to address behavioral and attention \ndisabilities since he was a young child.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 15 of 41\n41. \nWhile at BCCY, Brian B. attends school five days per week at Riverside Alternative School. \nBrian B. is currently in tenth grade and repeated sixth grade. While at school, he has access to work \non a computer while a teacher is present in the room. Brian B. believes he is earning high school \ncredits through his attendance at Riverside Alternative School.  \n42. \nBrian B. participates in group counseling on a daily basis at his dormitory. He also works \nwith a counselor in individual sessions once a week. \n43. \nBrian B. first learned about the plan to move youth to LSP while watching the television \nnews at BCCY. OJJ staff subsequently told Brian B. that he was one of the youths who would be \ntransferred. Brian B was shocked and confused by this news. Unlike many youth who OJJ plans to \ntransfer, Brian B. does not have a history of attempted escapes from any OJJ facility, which has \nadded to his confusion about why he would be sent to the OJJ site at Angola.  \n44. \nLike Brian B., his peers at BCCY fear being sent to the Angola site and have shared with \nhim their fear of being moved there.  \n45. \nBrian B. filed an Emergency Grievance pursuant to OJJ’s Administrative Remedy Procedure \n(ARP) on September 2, 2022.  Despite the imminent nature of Plaintiff’s anticipated move to the \nOJJ site at Angola and the serious physical and psychological harm Plaintiff is already experiencing \nas a result, OJJ responded that same day by stating that Plaintiff is “not subject to any immediate risk \nof harm” and therefore his ARP would be reviewed “within the regular ARP time limits.”  OJJ’s \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 16 of 41\nfailure to properly treat Plaintiff’s grievance as an emergency grievance that requires an expedited \ntimeline has made the grievance process unavailable to Plaintiff.  As a result, Plaintiff has exhausted \nall available administrative remedies and represents the Class in this action. \n46. \nPLAINTIFF CHARLES C. is 16 years old. He is currently in the secure custody of \nDefendant  SOMMERS  and  OJJ,  at  the  Acadiana  Center  for  Youth  at  St.  Martinville  (“St. \nMartinville”).  \n47. \nCharles C. is in the LAMOD program at St. Martinville. He is currently assigned to the \nCharlie pod. \n48. \nCharles C. has been informed by staff at St. Martinville that if he misbehaves, he will be \ntransferred to Angola. \n49. \nIn the past, Charles C. has been hospitalized for mental health crises. Each time, he stayed \nabout a week at the mental health hospital. \n50. \nCharles C. is a youth with a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the \nADA. He has been diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and PTSD. The main \nmedication he has been taking is Seroquel, which he was taking until last Friday when he was \ninstructed to stop because it was making him pre-diabetic. He has also taken Adderall, Risperdal, \nClonidine, Wafazine, and Remeron in the past to treat his mental health conditions. \n51. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 17 of 41\nAt St. Martinville, Charles C. attends school five days per week. He is currently in tenth \ngrade. Charles C. believes he is earning high school credits through his classes at St. Martinville. \n52. \nCharles C. receives individual counseling once a week for about thirty minutes at St. \nMartinville. \n53. \nCharles C. first learned about the plan to move youth to Angola a couple of months ago from \nstaff at St. Martinville, who told him that he has been behaving well, but if he started behaving badly \nagain, he would be sent to Angola. Staff at St. Martinville have been saying the same to him since \nthen, including as recently as three weeks ago. Charles C. has heard staff at St. Martinville say the \nsame to other kids.  \n54. \nCharles C. is worried, scared, and anxious about being sent to Angola, and has had trouble \nsleeping because of this. He has heard of Angola and knows it is an adult prison, that he would be \nliving in the old death row, and is concerned about being locked in a cell most of the time if he is \nmoved there.  \n55. \nCharles  C.  filed  an  Emergency  Grievance  pursuant  to  OJJ’s  Administrative  Remedy \nProcedure (ARP) on October 25, 2022. \n56. \nCharles C. brings his lawsuit through his mother and next friend, Kenione Rogers, who is \nan adult resident of the state of Louisiana. Kenione Rogers brings this action on Charles C.’s \nbehalf pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2). Ms. Rogers is dedicated to the best interests of Charles \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 18 of 41\nC. and will advocate for those best interests in this action.  Like her son, Ms. Rogers is worried \nCharles C. might be sent to the Angola site. \n57. \nDEFENDANT  JOHN  BEL  EDWARDS  (Defendant  Edwards)  is  an  adult  resident  of \nLouisiana.  Defendant Edwards is the Governor of Louisiana and responsible for the faithful \nexecution of the laws of Louisiana. In addition, he is responsible for appointments of the Secretary \nof the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections and Deputy Secretary of the Office of \nJuvenile Justice. Defendant Edwards is a final juvenile justice policymaker who at times delegates \npolicymaking authority to other Defendants named in this lawsuit. At all pertinent times, Defendant \nEdwards was acting under color of law. Defendant Edwards is being sued in his official capacity as \nGovernor of Louisiana. \n58. \nDEFENDANT  WILLIAM  SOMMERS  (Defendant  Sommers)  is  an  adult  resident  of \nLouisiana.  Defendant Sommers is the Deputy Secretary of the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nresponsible for the development and execution of Louisiana’s juvenile justice policy who at times \ndelegates policymaking authority to others in the OJJ.  At all pertinent times, Defendant Sommers \nwas acting under color of law.  Defendant Sommers is being sued in his official capacity as the \nDeputy Secretary of the Office of Juvenile Justice. \n59. \nDefendant JAMES M.

Defendant LeBlanc is being sued in his official capacity as \nthe Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nI.  The Adult Prison Physical Environment, Design, and Architecture of the OJJ Site at \nAngola is Inappropriate and Constitutes Punishment for Youth Transferred there. \n \n60. \nDefendants’ decision to transfer youth to an adult maximum-security prison flies in the face \nof prevailing professional standards of juvenile justice, as it plainly promotes punishment instead \nof rehabilitation. As noted above, the Casey Foundation has instructed that “[j]uvenile detention \nfacilities  should  not  look  like  or  be  operated  as  jails.”13  As  a  result,  the  Casey  foundation \n“encourages facilities to provide a non-penal environment appropriate for youth who need to be \nheld in a secure setting,” which includes ensuring that “the facility is clean, meets fire and safety \ncodes,  has  properly  functioning  temperature  controls,  light  and  ventilation  and  offers  youth \nappropriate living conditions,” and “that youth will have clean, properly-fitting clothing; pleasant, \nhealthy eating experiences; permission to retain appropriate personal items; and some measure of \nprivacy.”14 Indeed, one of the Casey Foundation’s recommended standards is for juvenile facilities \nto have “[f]urnishings and other decorations reflect a home-like, non-penal environment supportive \nof boys and girls to the maximum extent possible.”15  \n61. \nThe IJA-ABA Commission explained in its recommendations on the architecture of juvenile \njustice facilities that: \n \n13 Annie E. Casey Foundation, Juvenile Detention Facility Assessment, https://cclp.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/06/JDAI-Detention-Facility-Assessment-Standards.pdf at 77 (last accessed 10.25.22). \n14 Id. \n15 Id. at 79. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 20 of 41\n \nThe importance of this standard [(that “[s]ecure settings should provide \nsecurity measures which . . . instill a sense of security and well-being in \nfacility residents; and . . . rely on increased staff coverage rather than building \nplant”)]  is  that  it  does  not  interpret  security  as  simply  controlling  the \nactivities of many residents with as few staff as possible, thereby minimizing \nstaff and resident contact. It avoids the routinizing of activities, the boredom, \nand the brutality that often occurs in facilities designed on maximum security \nprinciples, whether for youths or adults. . . . The youth in detention or \ncorrections should not be viewed as deviant, subhuman, or mindless. He or \nshe should be treated with respect, encouraged to form a positive self-image, \nand provided with an interesting and varied program of activities.16 \n \n62. \nThe United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty prescribe \nsimilar recommendations. Specifically, they state “[s]leeping accommodation [for youth in juvenile \nfacilities] should normally consist of small group dormitories or individual bedrooms,” and “[t]he \ndesign of detention facilities for juveniles and the physical environment should be in keeping with \nthe rehabilitative aim of residential treatment, with due regard to the need of the juvenile for \nprivacy, sensory stimuli, opportunities for association with peers and participation in sports, \nphysical exercise and leisure-time activities.”17 \n63. \nYouth transferred to the OJJ site at Angola will be forced to live in single cells that have \npreviously only been used by adults incarcerated at LSP––originally by adult men on death row, \nand more recently by adult women. These cells have floor-to-ceiling sliding barred doorways that \nlock from the outside, a correctional-style metal cot, and a metal sink and metal toilet without a seat \n \n16 Institute of Judicial Administration American Bar Association, Juvenile Justice Standards, Standards Relating to \nArchitecture of Facilities, https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/83567.pdf (last accessed Oct. 25, 2022)  (emphasis \nadded). \n17 United Nations General Assembly resolution 45/113, United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived \nof their Liberty, adopted Dec. 14, 1990, https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/united-nations-\nrules-protection-juveniles-deprived-their-liberty (emphasis added). \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 21 of 41\nor cover. Because of the bars instead of doors, youth living in these cells lack privacy: indeed, when \nthey are changing clothes or using the toilet, any person in the hallway outside the cell––including \nstaff and/or other youth––is able to see the youth while exposed inside their cell. This contravenes \nthe recommended practice for juvenile facilities, as youth should be able to “change clothing without \nnonmedical staff of the opposite gender viewing their breasts, buttocks, or genitalia, except in \nexigent circumstances.”18 \n64. \nNothing about these cells resembles the dormitories or individual rooms that are standard in \njuvenile facilities; instead, they are different from the living and sleeping environments to which \nPlaintiffs and putative class members are accustomed in OJJ youth facilities. A photo of a cell in \nthe OJJ site at Angola where youth will live is below: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n65. \nOutside, the OJJ site at Angola is surrounded by high fences with razor wire and guard \ntowers, as depicted in the photographs of the site below. These features are characteristic of adult \n \n18 Annie E.

Youth Transferred to the OJJ Site at Angola Face an Increased Risk of Suicide, Solitary \nConfinement, and Use of Force by Staff. \n \n66. \nYouth in adult facilities are more likely to die by suicide, more likely to suffer from sexual \nassault and trauma, and more likely to experience exacerbated mental health disabilities than youth \nwho are not housed in adult facilities. These experiences can lead to long-term consequences for the \nmental and physical health of vulnerable youth in the juvenile and criminal legal system, many of \nwhom have already experienced significant trauma and mental health disabilities. As one former \ntop OJJ official has explained, even just informing youth that they will be placed at an adult facility \nis likely to cause “mental anguish” for youth who have already experienced significant trauma in \ntheir lives. Plaintiffs’ experiences confirm this prediction––each has experienced significant fear, \nanxiety, and worsening mental health symptoms due to the fear and anticipation of being transferred \nto Angola. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 23 of 41\n67. \nThe design of the prison cells in which youth at the OJJ site at Angola are being and will be \nheld creates a heightened risk of suicide. The bars provide multiple “cut-off” points around which \nyouth could tie sheets or comparable items. Unlike their peers in juvenile facilities with individual \nrooms or dormitories, rather than barred cells, youth transferred to the OJJ site at Angola face a \ngreater risk of suicide by the very architecture of the facility. \n68. \nThere are no windows in the cells that house youth in OJJ custody. \n69. \nPlaintiffs and putative class members are highly likely to be subject to solitary confinement \nbecause of the limited physical space available at the OJJ site at Angola for behavioral interventions \nand due to staffing limitations. Solitary confinement––even for only two days––has been linked to \nincreased rates of suicide, depression, paranoia, and anxiety in adults. These harmful outcomes are \nfurther amplified in youth. Indeed, youth are especially vulnerable to severe mental and physical \nharm as a result of solitary confinement, including developmental delay and psychosis. When youth \nare placed in solitary confinement, supportive or social systems they may have are often withdrawn, \nincluding educational and mental health programming and communication with their families. As a \nresult, youth placed in solitary confinement are precluded from participating in rehabilitative \nprogramming necessary for their growth and development, contrary to prevailing professional \nstandards of juvenile justice. \n70. \nYouth transferred to the OJJ site at Angola are also likely to be subject to uses of force that \nare inappropriate for and especially dangerous to young people. As noted above, the MOU between \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 24 of 41\nOJJ and LSP/DOC explicitly permits DOC staff to use force they are trained to use against adults \nat LSP against youth. The MOU states that “DOC/LSP may provide general supplemental security \nstaffing inside BCCY-WF [(the OJJ site at Angola)], upon request and availability, on an interim \nbasis until BCCY-WF is fully staffed. During this temporary timeframe, DOC/LSP staff shall utilize \nchemical spray, electronic control weapons (‘Tasers’) and the use of force continuum for which \nthey are trained.” \n71. \nOleoresin  capsicum  (OC) spray  (pepper spray)  is  a  chemical spray that  incapacitates \nindividuals by causing burning, swelling, and tearing of the eyes. It may also restrict breathing by \naffecting one’s lungs and respiratory tract. While dangerous to anyone, young people “are uniquely \nsusceptible to deployment of and exposure to riot-control agents such as tear gas and pepper spray” \nbecause of their higher respiratory rates than adults, which makes it more likely they will inhale \nmore of the pepper-sprayed air than adults.19 The Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators \n(now called the Council of Juvenile Justice Administrators) has stated that the use of pepper spray \n“has been shunned by juvenile correctional agencies because of the harm it causes to youths and the \nnegative impact it has on staff-youth relationships” and “very few states authorize its use and in the \nstates that allow its use in policy, most prohibit the use except as a last resort and with many \nconditions and few facilities put it into practice.”20 One court has concluded that “the indiscriminate \nuse of CS gas violates the juveniles’ constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause.”21 Even if \nOJJ’s policy does not permit indiscriminate use of chemical sprays, the MOU permits DOC/LSP \n \n19 Irwin Rendlener, Tear Gas Should Never Be Used on Children.

Youth Transferred to the OJJ Site at Angola Are Unlikely to Receive Adequate \nMedical, Educational, Rehabilitative, and Other Services.  \n \n72. \nThe OJJ site at Angola is not equipped to provide adequate recreation, medical care and \nmental health programming, education, and other forms of rehabilitation. As a result, youth moved \nto the OJJ site at Angola will be less likely to progress on their rehabilitative journey so that they \ncan return home to their families and communities. For example, upon information and belief, it is \nunlikely based on the infrastructure of the OJJ site at Angola that youth will have adequate indoor \nrecreation opportunities if the weather does not permit outdoor recreation; youth transferred to the \nOJJ site at Angola may receive medical care onsite at the infirmary at LSP in cases of emergency, \nwhich this Court has already ruled is constitutionally inadequate medical care; it is unclear and \nunlikely that sufficient numbers of teachers will be hired to provide adequate education to youth \nheld at the OJJ site at Angola; and it is unclear where youth will receive in-person contact visitation \nwith family at the OJJ site at Angola. \n73. \nMembers of the disability subclass will be denied the programming, treatment, education, \nand accommodations they are entitled to under federal disability rights laws.  \n74. \nDefendants have a long history of operational failings in Louisiana’s secure care system for \nyouth, which have been well-documented. At the OJJ facility at St. Martinville, which was, like the \nAngola site, developed as a temporary facility called a “Transitional Treatment Unit” for certain \nhigh-risk youth, youth were not provided education, as “Perry Stagg, OJJ’s assistant secretary, \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 26 of 41\nconfirmed that St. Martinville did not initially provide education” and the Louisiana Department of \nEducation and Louisiana Special School District did not even learn about the new facility until months \nafter it opened.22 Defendants acknowledge that these operational deficiencies have caused a situation \nat BCCY in which they are not properly caring for youth in OJJ’s custody there. \n75. \nJuvenile justice experts and organizations agree that indoor and outdoor recreation is crucial \nto youth in juvenile facilities. According to the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles \nDeprived of their Liberty, “[e]very juvenile should have the right to a suitable amount of time for \ndaily free exercise, in the open air whenever weather permits, during which time appropriate \nrecreational and physical training should normally be provided. Adequate space, installations and \nequipment should be provided for these activities.”23 The Casey Foundation similarly encourages \nfacilities to “offer[] youth a range of choices for recreational activities in dayrooms or common \nareas.”24 \n76. \nThe OJJ site at Angola has inadequate indoor and outdoor recreation facilities. When \nDefendants represented that youth would be moved to the site earlier, before the conclusion of the \npreliminary injunction hearing in this case, the OJJ site at Angola had only a muddy grass are with \none basketball goal, making it impossible for youth to play even a half-court game since they could \nnot dribble the ball. Although recent media reporting indicates Defendants have covered the area \nwith concrete, the outdoor recreation area likely remains inadequate given the limited physical \nactivities youth can engage in within that singular outdoor space. There is also no indication youth \n \n22 Erin Einhorn, et al., 'No light. No nothing.' Inside Louisiana's harshest juvenile lockup, NBC News, Mar. 10, 2022, \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-juvenile-detention-st-martinvillle-rcna19227.   \n23  United Nations General Assembly resolution 45/113, supra note 17. \n24 Annie E. Casey Foundation, supra note 14, at 59. \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 27 of 41\nwould receive adequate recreational opportunities indoors if the weather does not permit outdoor \nrecreation. The small room designated for recreation at the OJJ site at Angola is inadequate for \nindoor recreation and lacked any appropriate equipment for recreation. \n77. \nYouth transferred to the OJJ site at Angola also face unreasonable risks of harm to their \nhealth and safety. Defendants plan to provide medical and mental health care in certain offices in \nthe OJJ site at Angola. The nearest hospital to LSP is West Feliciana Parish, 24 miles away, which \ndoes not provide a full range of emergency and other health care services. OJJ would transport \nchildren offsite for health care in staff cars or in ambulances overseen by LSP. The hospital with \nwhich OJJ contracts  is 134 miles away.  Defendants  have admitted that  in  cases of medical \nemergency, youth at the OJJ site at Angola may receive medical care at the infirmary onsite at LSP–\n–used and staffed by adults incarcerated there––which this Court recently determined in another \nlitigation to be constitutionally inadequate medical care for the adult patients. Youth transferred to \nthe OJJ site at Angola who may receive medical care at the infirmary for adults at LSP are in danger \nof receiving equally inadequate medical treatment, placing their health and lives at risk. \n78. \nYouth transferred to the OJJ site at Angola also are unlikely to receive adequate education. \nOJJ is understaffed, including its teachers. As of September 8, 2022, only one teacher had been \nhired for the OJJ site at Angola; Defendants have represented that they will have three teachers and \nthree tutors for twenty-four students on site for each school day and two special education teachers, \nneither of whom had been hired as of that date. The rooms designated as classrooms at the OJJ site \nat Angola did not have whiteboards set up or books or any standard classroom equipment other than \ndesks in early September 2022.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 28 of 41\n79. \nThe existing visitation space at the OJJ site at Angola does not permit contact in-person \nvisits; there is a mesh screen fully separating youth from their visitor(s). Although Defendants claim \ncontact visits will be provided with family members, OJJ has not established areas in the OJJ site at \nAngola for such in-person contact visitation. \nIV.  Youth  with  Disabilities  Transferred  to  the  OJJ  Site  at  Angola  Will  Require \nReasonable Accommodations and Modifications that Defendants are Unlikely to \nProvide at that Site.  \n \n80. \nBecause the Defendants’ criteria for transferring young people to the OJJ site at Angola \nchiefly or solely consist of referrals based on bad behavior, youth with mental health and other \ndisabilities are more likely to be sent to the OJJ site at Angola. OJJ’s policy sets forth certain \n“[a]dmission criteria” for youth to be considered for transfer to the OJJ site at Angola, and states \nthat “a youth must meet at least one of the following criteria” to be eligible for transfer to Angola. \nThese criteria include whether the youth has, inter alia, “exhibited a pattern of battery on other \nyouth which has not been substantially reduced by prior intervention efforts,” “[h]as committed a \nsingle battery/predatory act of such serious consequence that the potential of reoccurrence must be \nactively prevented,” “[h]as been in possession of a significant weapon,” “[h]as marijuana or other \nillegal substances in possession or has a substantial amount with motivation to distribute.” OJJ’s \npolicy also states that “up to four youth classified as Seriously Mentally Ill may be transferred to \nthe program after a consensus recommendation from an [multidisciplinary team] staffing.” \n81. \nAlthough OJJ represents that this referral form will lead to a team meeting to evaluate each \nchild to be sent to Angola, the form itself includes a bypass provision whereby youth who are alleged \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 29 of 41\nto have committed serious behavior infractions will be sent directly, without a team meeting. In \nthose cases, there will be no individualized assessment of children’s needs or disabilities. \n82. \nAll youth who may be transferred to the OJJ site at Angola are likely to face serious \npsychological and physical harm. Youth with disabilities who are transferred to the OJJ site at \nAngola are likely to face even worse treatment, and suffer even more, than their peers who do not \nhave disabilities.  \n83. \nThe ADA and the Rehabilitation Act require all covered entities to provide reasonable \nmodifications in their policies, practices, and procedures in order to give people with disabilities an \nequal opportunity to benefit from the entity’s programs, services, and activities. OJJ is a covered \nentity under these laws. OJJ has failed to make modifications to ensure that children with disabilities \nare not sent to Angola because of their disabilities, or harmed in Angola. OJJ has also failed to \naccommodate individual children’s disabilities who have been or will be transferred to the Angola \nsite. \n84. \nThe ADA and the Rehabilitation Act also prohibit covered entities from using methods of \nadministration that defeat or impair the accomplishment and objectives of the public entity’s \nprogram. As the agency responsible for youth adjudicated delinquent, OJJ’s main purpose is \nrehabilitation, treatment, education, and preparing youth to return to society with the skills and tools \nto lead a safe, law-abiding life. By setting up a system where youth with disabilities in OJJ’s custody \nwill disproportionately face the harsh and harmful impact of transfer and incarceration at Angola, \nOJJ’s methods of administration discriminate against youth with disabilities, in violation of federal \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 30 of 41\nlaw.   \n85. \nDefendants are also failing to consider individuals’ disabilities and failing to modify their \nevaluation and notice criteria for transfer to the OJJ site at Angola. As a result, Defendants’ system \ndiscriminates against youth with disabilities, who will face additional harm and negative outcomes \nas a result of Defendants’ unlawful actions and practices––including potentially being transferred \nto the OJJ site at Angola because of their disabilities, and lacking the accommodations, supports, \nand modifications necessary within the transfer process and once housed in Angola. \nV.  Defendants  Have  Alternative,  Less  Punitive  Options  Available  to  Them  Short  of \nTransferring Youth to a Notorious Maximum-Security Adult Prison. \n \n86. \nIf Defendants cannot, in their view, lawfully provide rehabilitative care to youth in their \nexisting  secure  care facilities while also maintaining public safety, they have other responses \navailable to them that are short of transferring youth to Angola or another adult prison. \n87. \nDefendants are able to review youth in OJJ custody who may be eligible for release and \nfacilitate their release to alternatives to detention in order to reduce overall facility population. \nDefendants are also able to review youth in OJJ secure care and identify those who can be stepped \ndown to less secure environments. These measures would reduce the population in the secure \nfacilities Defendants are having trouble controlling, thus allowing Defendants to provide appropriate \ncare and services to Plaintiffs and putative class members in danger of being transferred to the OJJ \nsite at Angola.  \n88. \nJuvenile justice experts and organizations have long stated that using community-based \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 31 of 41\nalternatives to release youth who may not need to be held in facilities can lessen the burden on \njuvenile justice systems and advance rehabilitation while maintaining security. A literature review \nconducted by the OJJDP on alternatives to detention and confinement for children explains that \n“research has shown that juveniles who are kept in the community recidivate less often than \npreviously detained youths . . . [a]s a result, several researchers . . . suggest that placing juveniles in \ncommunity settings that offer appropriate rehabilitation services will serve public safety better than \ndetention or confinement,” and that “research has demonstrated that detention and confinement \nfacilities negatively affect a child’s mental state, academic aptitude, and employment prospects.”25 \nThe IJA-ABA Commission expressed that “[t]he standards recommend the development of a range \nof small, community-based facilities because such facilities are able to adapt to a range of programs \nand policy requirements to use community resources, to architecturally relate to the buildings in the \nsurrounding area, and to provide a richer range of options to ensure security.”26 \n89. \nThe OJJDP has also offered to work with Defendants to avoid transferring youth to the \nAngola site, recognizing the grave harms such a transfer would cause to youth. Other juvenile justice \nexperts, advocates, and officials have also offered to work with Defendants to hire experts in the field \nto conduct a systemwide assessment to safely reduce the overall population of youth adjudicated \ndelinquent in OJJ facilities and create specialized treatment units within existing OJJ facilities that \noffer rehabilitation based on best practices. \n \n \n \n25 U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Literature Review Alternatives \nto Detention and Confinement, Aug. 2014, https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/model-programs-guide/literature-\nreviews/alternatives_to_detection_and_confinement.pdf. \n26 Institute of Judicial Administration American Bar Association, Juvenile Justice Standards, Standards Relating to \nArchitecture of Facilities, https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/83567.pdf. \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 32 of 41\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n90. \nAlex A., Brian B., and Charles C. (“Named Plaintiffs”) bring this action on behalf of themselves \nand all others similarly situated as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \n91. \nThe class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as all current and future persons held in \nOJJ’s secure or other custody who have been or might be transferred to the OJJ site at Angola or \nanother adult prison. \n92. \nNamed Plaintiffs Alex A., Brian B., and Charles C. also seek to represent a subclass of all \ncurrent and future persons with disabilities as defined under the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act held in OJJ’s secure or other custody who have been or might be transferred to \nthe OJJ site at Angola or another adult prison (the “Disability Subclass”). \n93. \nThis action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  This action satisfies the requirements of numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). It also satisfies the \ncriteria for certifying a class action for declaratory and/or injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2). \n94. \nAny youth in OJJ custody ages ten through eighteen who satisfy OJJ’s selection criteria are \neligible for transfer to the OJJ site at Angola. Each youth who is now or will be in OJJ custody at \nrisk of transfer to the OJJ site at Angola, or has already been transferred to the OJJ site at Angola, is \na member of the proposed class.  \n \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 33 of 41\n95. \nOn any given day there are approximately 356 youth in OJJ’s secure care custody, the \nsubgroup of youth in OJJ custody who are most susceptible to transfer to the OJJ site at Angola. A \nsignificant proportion of these youth have disabilities, given that approximately 70 percent of youth \nin juvenile detention nationwide have educational or other disabilities. Given that Defendants have \nstated the OJJ site at Angola will be a temporary facility where they plan to have youth in custody \nfor about 4-to-6 weeks per youth, the population at the OJJ site at Angola will be fluid and constantly \nchanging. In addition, class members are detained and most or all are low-income, which limit their \nability to institute individual lawsuits.  The proposed class and subclass are therefore sufficiently \nnumerous as to make joinder impracticable. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n96 \nCommon questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class. The Named Plaintiffs \nseek common declarative and injunctive relief concerning whether Defendants’ policies, practices, \nand procedures violate the constitutional and statutory rights of the class members. These common \nquestions of fact and law include whether the transfer of youth adjudicated delinquent and not \nconvicted of any crime may be transferred to the OJJ site at Angola. With respect to the Disability \nSubclass,  common  questions  of  fact  and  law  include  whether  OJJ  is  failing  to  provide \naccommodations and modifications required by disability rights laws, and whether children with \ndisabilities are experiencing discrimination due to OJJ’s failure to consider and account for known \ndisabilities.  \n97. \nNamed Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class members’ claims. The injuries that Named \nPlaintiffs have suffered and will suffer because of Defendants’ unconstitutional and illegal course of \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 34 of 41\nconduct are typical of the injuries suffered by the class. All class members seek the same declaratory \nand injunctive relief. \n98. \nThe Named Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the class and the subclass, respectively, \nbecause their interests in the vindication of the legal claims they raise are entirely aligned with the \ninterests of the other class members, each of whom has the same constitutional (and, for the subclass, \nstatutory) claims.  There are no known conflicts of interest among members of the proposed class, \nand the interests of the Named Plaintiffs do not conflict with those of the other class members. \n99. \nPlaintiffs are represented by counsel with experience and success in litigating complex civil \nrights matters in federal court. The interests of the members of the class and subclass will be fairly \nand adequately protected by the Named Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \n100. \nBecause the putative class challenges Defendants’ system as unconstitutional and illegal \nthrough declaratory and injunctive relief that would apply the same relief to every member of the \nclass and subclass, certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate and necessary. \n101. \nA class action is the only practicable means by which the Named Plaintiffs and class members \ncan  challenge  the  Defendants’  unconstitutional  actions  and  obtain  the  necessary  immediate \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief sought for themselves and all other members of the class. \n \n \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 35 of 41\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT I (on behalf of Alex A., Brian B., Charles C. and the proposed class): \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief for Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n102. \nBy  transferring  youth  adjudicated  delinquent  to  the  grounds  of  the  Louisiana  State \nPenitentiary at Angola, a maximum-security adult prison, in a building designed for death row \nprisoners, Defendants violate their duty to provide conditions of reasonable health and safety to the \nyouth they holds in their custody, and demonstrate deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of \nserious harm to Plaintiffs and putative class members, in violation of their rights  under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Defendants’ actions also constitute punishment of \nPlaintiffs and putative class members, who are in civil detention, in violation of their substantive \ndue process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n103. \nPlaintiffs and the proposed Class have suffered and will imminently suffer irreparable injury \nas a result of Defendants’ policies, practices, and failures to act and are entitled to injunctive relief \nto avoid any further injury.  \nCOUNT II (on behalf of Alex A., Brian B., Charles C., and the proposed Disability \nSubclass): Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 \n \n104. \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that “no otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability … shall, solely by reason of [] disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial  assistance.”  29  U.S.C.  §  794(a).

Defendants are further violating the Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act by employing methods of administration (including selection criteria that \npenalize conduct that is likely disability-related) that tend to discriminate against people with \ndisabilities by placing them at heightened risk of transfer to an inappropriate, harmful, and dangerous \nadult facility.  By transferring youth adjudicated delinquent who have disabilities to the OJJ site at \nAngola, where they will  likely  face  exacerbation of their disabilities and inadequate support, \nDefendants are in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n108. \nBy transferring youth adjudicated delinquent who have disabilities to the OJJ site at Angola \ninstead of making reasonable modifications to appropriately address each youth’s disability-related \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 96    10/25/22   Page 37 of 41\nbehaviors in OJJ’s existing facilities, Defendants violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n109. \nBy transferring youth adjudicated delinquent who have disabilities to the OJJ site at Angola, \nDefendants are punishing and discriminating against youth with disabilities by disproportionately \nsegregating them from their peers in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n110. \nPlaintiffs with disabilities have also suffered and will imminently suffer irreparable injury \nas a result of Defendants’ policies, practices, and failures to act and are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to avoid any further injury.  \nCOUNT III (on behalf of Alex A., Brian B., Charles C. and the proposed subclass): \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief for Violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. \n \n111. \nTitle II of the ADA requires that public entities refrain from discriminating against qualified \nindividuals on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132.

The Plaintiffs in this matter are youth who have been \nadjudicated delinquent in Louisiana’s juvenile justice system and are in the custody of the Office \nof Juvenile Justice (OJJ) for the purpose of receiving treatment and rehabilitation. The Plaintiffs \nallege, among other things, that Defendants have confined these youth on the former death row \ncell block of the Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly known as “Angola,” deprived them of \neducation and mental health services, exposed them to dangerous living conditions, and \nsubjected them to harmful periods of isolation. These conditions, Plaintiffs claim, violate the \nEighth Amendment. Doc. 166, Mem. in Supp. Pls.’ 2d Mot. Prel. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 11. The \nUnited States submits this Statement of Interest to draw the Court’s attention to relevant case law \nand research regarding the serious and lasting harms that youth may experience when subjected \nto the alleged conditions of confinement, particularly isolation.  \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 183    07/28/23   Page 2 of 13\nI.  Interest of the United States \nThe United States files this Statement of Interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517, which \nauthorizes the Attorney General “to attend to the interests of the United States” in any case \npending in federal court.1 The United States is charged with enforcing the constitutional rights of \nyouth in institutions pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§1997 (CRIPA), as well as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, 34 U.S.C. \n§12601 (Section 12601) (giving Attorney General authority to seek declaratory and injunctive \nrelief for violations of the Constitution or federal law by entities responsible for “the \nincarceration of juveniles”). The United States has a long history of enforcing children’s \nconstitutional rights under CRIPA and Section 12601, including the rights of youth in the \njuvenile justice system to protection from harmful conditions of confinement. The United States \nfiles this Statement of Interest to assist the Court in its analysis of Plaintiffs’ Second Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction and Memorandum in Support thereof. See Doc. 163, Pls.’ 2d Mot. Prelim. \nInj.; Doc. 166, Pls.’ Mem. \nThe Civil Rights Division has previously exercised the United States’ authority under \nCRIPA and Section 12601 to address issues related to conditions of confinement for youth in the \njuvenile and criminal justice systems, most recently in the South Carolina Department of \nJuvenile Justice Broad River Road Complex and the Manson Youth Institution in Cheshire, \nConnecticut.2 \n \n1  The full text of 28 U.S.C. § 517 is as follows: “The Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department \nof Justice, may be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the \ninterests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court of a State, or to \nattend to any other interest of the United States.” \n2  Settlement Agreement between the United States and the South Carolina Dep’t of Juvenile Justice, \nUnited States v.

Background \nPlaintiffs brought this action individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated \nagainst state officials to address the transfer to Angola of youth who have been adjudicated \ndelinquent. Doc. 96, First Am. Comp. at 1. Angola has a long history of abuse and brutality.3 \nDoc. 79, Ruling on Pls.’ Mot. for TRO (“Ruling”) at 2. The youth in Angola are confined on a \ncell block that formerly held death row inmates. Id. They are surrounded by razor wire, guard \ntowers, and swampland. Id. at 48. \nOn August 19, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that \nDefendants are violating Plaintiffs’ constitutional and federal statutory rights by transferring \nthem to “a notoriously dangerous maximum security adult prison” without a plan to provide \nrequired services and sufficient safety.

Id.  \n  On September 23, 2022, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion. The Court was “persuaded \nthat transferring emotionally vulnerable adolescents…to a prison camp on the grounds of \nAngola” would “likely have deleterious psychological ramifications,” but ultimately relied on \nassurances by Defendants regarding plans for ensuring safety and services for the youth. Doc. \n79, Ruling at 60. Defendants testified the Angola placement was a temporary measure to house \nbetween 24 and 30 youth at a time and would facilitate rehabilitation, not punishment. Id. at 18, \n23. Defendants also testified there would be no risk of loss or reduction to programs and \nservices, no excessive or abusive solitary confinement, and no risk of youth being housed in unfit \nfacilities. Id. at 18–19. The Court found Defendants’ evidence established that “no youth will be \ntransferred until the facility is ready, properly staffed, and can fully provide educational, \nmedical, mental health, recreational, and food services.” Id. at 19.   \nSince late October 2022, OJJ has incarcerated a total of between 70 and 80 youth, some \nas young as 15, in Angola. Doc. 166, Pls.’ Mem. at 9–10. Most of these youth are Black. Id.  \nAdditionally, the youth in Angola are “likely already suffering from a history of trauma.” Doc. \n79, Ruling at 48.  \nOn July 18, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a second motion for preliminary injunction. Doc. 163, \nPls.’ 2d Mot. Prelim. Inj. Plaintiffs allege that, notwithstanding their assurances to the Court, \nDefendants have not given youth at Angola temporary therapeutic placements. Id. at 2. Rather, \nPlaintiffs allege, Defendants have regularly confined these young people in prolonged isolation, \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 183    07/28/23   Page 5 of 13\nfailed to provide them the educational and other services promised, and subjected them to \nexcessive heat and other dangerous living conditions. Id.   \nIII.  Discussion \nThe United States respectfully submits this Statement of Interest to draw the Court’s \nattention to the serious and irreparable harms that youth may experience when subjected to the \nalleged conditions of confinement. Case law and research show that isolation is particularly \nharmful to youth.4     \nA.  Youth are Particularly Vulnerable to Harmful Conditions of Confinement. \n \nPlaintiffs allege that the youth at Angola, including youth with mental health and other \ndisabilities, do not have adequate access to mental health and educational services. Doc. 166, \nPls.’ Mem. at 10–16. On one cell block, Plaintiffs allege, there are no teachers available to \nprovide youth instruction. Id. at 10–12. Plaintiffs also allege that youth at Angola do not have \nadequate access to recreation and exercise. Id. at 12–13. Instead, youth allegedly spend most of \ntheir time locked in their cells. Id. at 21. Youth at Angola also allegedly cannot have regular \ncontact with their families, id. at 14, suffer from excessive heat and a lack of adequate ventilation \nin their cells, and lack adequate access to safe drinking water. Id. at 17–22.  \nYouth are particularly vulnerable to harmful conditions of confinement such as those \nalleged because their brains are still developing and they lack adequate coping mechanisms.5 \nExposure to stressful conditions such as those alleged can result in long-term negative changes in \n \n4  Because the United States has not independently investigated the factual allegations of the second \nmotion for preliminary injunction, the United States takes no position on its merits. \n5  See See NAT’L ACADS. OF SCIS., ENG’G & MED., THE PROMISE OF ADOLESCENCE: REALIZING \nOPPORTUNITY FOR ALL YOUTH 58 (Richard J. Bonnie & Emily P. Backes eds., 2019), \nhttps://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25388/the-promise-of-adolescence-realizing-opportunity-for-\nall-youth [https://perma.cc/ACQ3-DKNH]. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 183    07/28/23   Page 6 of 13\nyouths’ bodies and brains.6 For youth exposed to high levels of stress, the resulting \nmaladaptation “disrupts brain circuitry and other organ and metabolic systems … during \nsensitive developmental periods, which may result in damage to the regulation of these \nsystems.”7 The risk of harm is particularly acute for the youth at Angola, whom this Court has \nfound are “likely already suffering from a history of trauma.” Doc. 79, Ruling at 48.8 \nIn assessing cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, the Supreme \nCourt has recognized the developmental vulnerability of children and adolescents, distinguishing \nchildren from adults in the criminal justice context.9 See Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012) \n(mandatory life imprisonment without parole for children is unconstitutional); Graham v. \nFlorida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010), as modified (July 6, 2010) (mandatory life imprisonment without \nparole for children who did not commit homicide is unconstitutional); Roper v. Simmons, 543 \nU.S. 551 (2005) (imposing the death penalty on children is unconstitutional). The Court has \nrecognized that youth “have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,” \nthat they are “more vulnerable…to negative influences and outside pressures,” and that their \ncharacters are not as “well formed” as those of adults. Miller, 567 U.S. at 471 (quoting Roper, \n \n6  Id. at 88–89. \n7  Id. at 89. \n8  RICHARD G. DUDLEY, JR., NEW PERSPECTIVES IN POLICING: CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND ITS EFFECTS: \nIMPLICATIONS FOR POLICE 5 (July 2015), https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/248686.pdf \n[https://perma.cc/65W4-EJAB] (discussing how repeated exposure to trauma causes changes in a youth’s \nbrain that impair the ability to effectively cope with stressors). \n9 As previously noted, the youth in this case have not been convicted of crimes, but rather, adjudicated \ndelinquent in Louisiana’s juvenile justice system for the purpose of receiving treatment and rehabilitation. \nLA CHILD. CODE ANN. art. 801 (“The purpose of [Louisiana’s juvenile justice system] is to … ensure that \n[a youth in the juvenile justice system] shall receive, preferably in his own home, the care, guidance, and \ncontrol that will be conducive to his welfare and the best interests of the state and that in those instances \nwhen he is removed from the control of his parents, the court shall secure for him care as nearly as \npossible equivalent to that which the parents should have given him.”). See also Application of Gault, 387 \nU.S. 1, 15 (1967) (the juvenile justice system was established to treat and rehabilitate children). \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:22-cv-00573-SDD-RLB     Document 183    07/28/23   Page 7 of 13\n543 U.S. at 569); see also Graham, 560 U.S. at 68. Thus, “youth is more than a chronological \nfact…. It is a moment and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence \nand to psychological damage.” Miller, 567 U.S. at 476 (internal quotations and citations \nomitted). In these decisions, the Court relied in part on “developments in psychology and brain \nscience [that] continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.” \nGraham, 560 U.S. at 68. \nThis Court previously found that the confinement of youth in Angola, even with promises \nof safety and services, places them at “serious risk of psychological harm.” Doc. 79, Ruling at \n48.10 If deprived of promised mental health and educational services and if subjected to isolation \nand other dangerous living conditions, youth in Angola are likely to suffer serious and \nirreparable harm to their physical and mental health. See Byrum v. Landreth, 566 F.3d 442, 445 \n(5th Cir. 2009) (stating elements for issuance of a preliminary injunction, including “a \nsubstantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued”). \nB.  Isolation is particularly harmful to youth. \n \nPlaintiffs allege that solitary confinement is not the exception for youth at Angola, but \ncloser to the rule. Plaintiffs allege that “youth are routinely locked in their cells for 23 hours a \nday” in their first 72 hours at Angola. Doc. 166, Pls. Mem. at 13. This initial period of \nconfinement is a critical period of adjustment. Indeed, a Department of Justice nationwide study \nfound that more than 40% of juvenile suicides in detention centers occurred within the first 72 \nhours of confinement.11 Plaintiffs also allege that the youth at Angola were on lock-down in their \n \n10  Given the alleged conditions at Angola, confining adjudicated youth there instead of in appropriate \ncommunity and juvenile justice settings also contradicts the purpose of Louisiana’s juvenile justice \nsystem.

Id. at 6–7, 13. These allegations stand in \ncontrast to Defendants’ previous testimony, which led to the Court’s finding that youth would be \n“confined to their cells while sleeping at night,” but “there was no evidence that OJJ has any \nintent to unlawfully subject youth to solitary confinement at [Angola].” Doc. 79, Ruling at 47.12 \nIt is now widely recognized within the medical, psychiatric, and correctional \ncommunities that isolation inflicts particular and serious harms on children because of their \ndevelopmental immaturity, brain development, and lack of effective coping mechanisms.13 As \nnoted above, youths’ brains are still developing,14 “making their time spent in solitary \nconfinement even more difficult and the developmental, psychological, and physical damage \nmore comprehensive and lasting.”15 Over 10 years ago, the United States Attorney General’s \nNational Task Force on Children Exposed to Violence similarly concluded that “[n]owhere is the \n \n12  These allegations, if true, also amount to a violation of Louisiana law, which prohibits solitary \nconfinement of any juvenile in the custody of OJJ “outside of regular sleeping hours,” for any period \nlonger than eight hours, and “for any reason other than a temporary response to behavior that poses a \nserious and immediate threat of physical harm to the juvenile or others.” LA Rev. Stat. § 15:905 (2022). \n13 Although research shows that isolation has a particularly damaging impact on children and adolescents, \nthe harms of isolation are not limited to them. See, e.g., Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 287 (2015) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (“The human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been \nunderstood[.]”); Palakovic v. Wetzel, 854 F.3d 209, 225 (3rd Cir. 2017) (noting “a growing consensus—\nwith roots going back a century—that conditions like those to which [the plaintiff] repeatedly was \nsubjected can cause severe and traumatic psychological damage, including anxiety, panic, paranoia, \ndepression, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, and even a disintegration of the basic sense of self \nidentity”); Stuart Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 WASH. U. J.L. & POL’Y 325, \n330–31 (“[E]ven a few days of solitary confinement will predictably shift the electroencephalogram \n(EEG) pattern toward an abnormal pattern characteristic of stupor and delirium.”). \n14  The prefrontal cortex of the brain – the area associated with response inhibition, emotional regulation, \nplanning, and organization – continues to develop well into a person’s 20s.

Conway, 236 F.Supp.3d \n554, 583 (N.D.N.Y. 2017) (enjoining disciplinary isolation of children in an adult facility and \nrelying on the “broad consensus among the scientific and professional community that juveniles \nare psychologically more vulnerable than adults”); A.T. v.

Hommrich, 2017 WL 1091864, at *2 (M.D. Tenn. 2017) (holding that \n“solitary confinement of juveniles in government custody for punitive or disciplinary reasons, \nespecially for extended periods of time and especially for youth who may suffer from mental \nillness, violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibitions against the inhuman treatment of \ndetainees”).  \n \n20  For the purposes of this Statement of Interest, we rely on the Eighth Amendment standard because the \nCourt has ruled that it applies. Doc. 79, Ruling at 44 (citing Morales v. Turman, 562 F.2d 993, 998 n.1 \n(5th Cir. 1977) and Alderson v. Concordia Par. Corr. Facility, 848 F.3d 415, 419-20 & n.4 (5th Cir. \n2017)). However, we note that the United States has previously taken the position that the Fourteenth \nAmendment applies to conditions of confinement for youth in the juvenile justice system because of its \nrehabilitative, rather than punitive, nature, and because youth adjudicated delinquent have not been \nconvicted of a crime.

In 2018, Congress passed the First \nStep Act, which prohibits the isolation of youth in federal facilities “for discipline, punishment, \nretaliation, or any reason other than as a temporary response to a covered juvenile’s behavior \n[which] poses a serious and immediate risk of physical harm to any individual, including the \ncovered juvenile.” 18 U.S.C. § 5043(b)(1).21 Numerous other organizations, such as the Annie E. \nCasey Foundation’s Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative, Council of Juvenile Correctional \nAdministrators, National Partnership for Juvenile Services,  and PbS Learning Institute have \nissued professional standards similarly limiting the use of isolation in juvenile justice facilities to \na brief de-escalation period (i.e., a short period to allow a child to regain emotional and physical \nself-control in response to an imminent risk of serious physical harm to another person).22  \nAs previously noted, the Court has already held that “transferring emotionally vulnerable \nadolescents, many of whom have mental health issues and cognitive disfunction, to a prison \n \n21  Under the Act, no child in federal custody may be kept in isolation for longer than three hours under \nany circumstances. 18 U.S.C. § 5043(b)(2)(B). The Act requires that facility staff members attempt to use \nless restrictive techniques prior to resorting to isolation, including talking with the child in an effort to de-\nescalate the situation, and allowing a qualified mental health professional to talk to the child. 18 U.S.C. § \n5043(b)(2)(A)(i). If staff nonetheless decide to place a child in isolation after attempting to use less \nrestrictive measures, they must explain to the child the reasons for doing so and that he or she will be \nreleased as soon as he or she regains self-control. 18 U.S.C. § 5043(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). If a child \ncontinues to pose a “serious and immediate risk of physical harm” beyond the maximum period of \npermissible time in isolation, the facility must transfer the child “to another juvenile facility or internal \nlocation where services can be provided to the covered juvenile without relying on room confinement,” or \n“if a qualified mental health professional believes the level of crisis service needed is not currently \navailable, a staff member of the juvenile facility shall initiate a referral to a location that can meet the \nneeds of the covered juvenile.” 18 U.S.C. § 5043(b)(2)(C). \n22  See Juv.

LEBLANC, in his official capacity \n as Secretary of the Louisiana Department  \nof Public Safety & Corrections \n \nRULING \nPursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the Court makes \nthe following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of law.  \nI.  FINDINGS OF FACT \nThis is a case of promises made and promises broken. Last summer, the Office of \nJuvenile Justice told this Court that, due to a shortage of adequate secure care facilities, \nit needed to use the former death row at Angola1 to temporarily house a small population \nof severely troubled and behaviorally challenged youth. It promised that renovated or new \nsecure housing for these adolescents would be available in April of this year.  \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice promised this Court that they would not violate the \nconstitutional rights of the young people housed at Angola if the Court would permit them \n \n1 The Court’s use of the terms “Angola” or the “Angola site or facility” refer to the Bridge City Center for \nYouth at West Feliciana (“BCCY-WF”), as it is called by Defendants. \nPage 1 of 20 \n \n\nto temporarily house a few youth for a short period of time. It argued that this drastic move \nwas needed to protect the public and other youth under its care. It was offered as a short-\nterm solution to a temporary space problem.  \nAs  of  last  week,  almost  a  year  later,  70  to  80  adolescent  boys  have  been \nincarcerated at the Angola facility.  \nAfter hearing seven days of testimony and considering thousands of pages of \nexhibits, the Court finds that the conditions of confinement of the youth incarcerated at \nAngola  constitute  cruel  and  unusual  punishment,  and  the  punitive  atmosphere  and \nsystemic programming failures violate the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe  Transitional  Treatment  Unit  at  Angola  does  not  provide  youth  with  a \nreasonable opportunity for rehabilitation, which is the professed goal of the Transitional \nTreatment Unit at Angola. The youth at Angola are being victimized, traumatized, and \nseriously and irreparably harmed.  \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice implored the Court to allow these seriously troubled \nyoung people to be housed at Angola for a short time promising that they would receive \nrobust rehabilitative treatment.  Regrettably, the Court bought what the Office of Juvenile \nJustice was selling, which was:   \n  use of the cell blocks at Angola would be temporary, \n  Angola would serve only a “very small population,” \n  the youth would be in their cells ONLY during sleeping hours, \n  it would offer rehabilitation not punishment,  \n  it would be properly and adequately staffed,  \n  it would provide the Free Appropriate Public Education guaranteed to all children, \nPage 2 of 20 \n \n\n  it would provide special education where necessary and appropriate, \n  it would provide necessary and appropriate mental health treatment, and \n  it would provide appropriate social services. \nBased on those sworn promises, the Court denied the Plaintiff’s request that the \nOffice of Juvenile Justice be prohibited from moving juveniles to the Angola site. Why did \nthe Office of Juvenile Justice make those promises - because such conditions and \nprogramming are required by law. \nVirtually every promise made was broken, causing severe and irreparable harm to \nthe wards that the Office of Juvenile Justice is obliged to help. \nPromise #1 \nThe use of the Angola site would be short term. A new facility was going to come \nonline in April 2023.2  \nAngola has now been used for almost a year, and the building that was supposed \nto be ready in April MIGHT be ready in December; the delay is blamed on bad weather \nand change orders. \nPromise # 2 \nAngola would be used for only a very small population; only “about five percent of \nthe youth,” would be eligible for transfer to Angola.3 \nOf the approximately 375 adolescents in the Office of Juvenile Justice secure care, \n70-80 have been transferred to Angola. \n \n \n \n2 Rec. Doc. 79, p. 50. \n3 Id. at p. 13. \nPage 3 of 20 \n \n\nPromise #3 \nThe following are the words of the Deputy Secretary of the Office of Juvenile \nJustice: \n“THIS IS NOT OUR CHILDREN BEING PLACED IN A CELL FOR 24 \nHOURS A DAY.”4 “THE ONLY TIME OUR YOUTH WILL BE IN THEIR \nROOMS IS AT NIGHTTIME, WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO TO SLEEP.”5  \n“YOU DO EVERYTHING OUTSIDE OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL CELLS, AND \nTHEN AT NIGHTTIME, WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO DOWN TO GO TO \nSLEEP, YOU GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM.”6 \n \nThose were the promises made by Otha “Curtis” Nelson, then-Assistant Secretary \nof the Office of Juvenile Justice, last September. He testified that legally, no child can be \nconfined in their room for more than 8 hours and then only after an assessment.7  The \ncells would be used only for sleeping. \nIn truth, right from the start, youth are locked in their cell for 48 to 72 hours for \n“orientation.” The youth eat two of three meals per day locked in their cells. Youth are \nlocked in their cells excessively and for days at a time as punishment. For example, Youth \n# 3 was confined to his cell 19 out of 30 days in June, 14 of which were consecutive days, \nand then he was confined another 9 out of 24 days in July. Youth # 5 was confined to his \ncell for 4 consecutive days after expressing suicidal thoughts and then locked in his cell \nfor another 6 days in the 2 weeks that followed. All youth on one of the tiers were locked \nin their cells for a week, and another youth was locked in his cell for 9 consecutive days. \nAt least 4 youth were locked in their cells for 5 straight days. \n \n4 Rec.

CHEMICALS (i.e, mace) ON THEM.”11 \n. . . \n \n“THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE DEPRIVED. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE \nTHEM  MORE,  BECAUSE  THAT'S  WHY  THEY  ARE  IN \nTHETRANSITIONAL TREATMENT UNIT.”12 \n \nBut  the  recent  evidence  showed  extensive  and  excessive  cell  restriction, \nindiscriminate use of hand cuffs and mace, and punitively denying youth family contact. \n \n8 Id. at 139:18. \n9 Id. at 140:20-21. \n10 Id. at 181:8. \n11 Id. at 80:6. \n12 Id. at 95:8-10. \nPage 5 of 20 \n \n\nEvery guard13 that testified said that cell restrictions are used as punishment. Physical \nrestraints are used indiscriminately when youth are out of their cells.  \nIn its site visit earlier this summer, the Court observed that the few youth who were \nnot in their cells were handcuffed. One young man was handcuffed while in the dining \nroom alone with two guards.  Two young men were handcuffed while playing cards with \ntwo guards, and another young man was handcuffed while writing in a journal under the \nsupervision of a guard. \nDirector London admitted that Youth are handcuffed during recreation if their \nbehavior is aggressive. There is no documentation of use of physical restraints despite \nthe fact that all use of force is required to be documented by agency Policy. \nGuards with a JJS4 designation can use restraints and cell restrictions at their \ndiscretion.  The guards also use mace or chemical agent.  Plaintiff’s Exhibit 440 is \ndisturbing video footage of a young man being maced while locked in his cell. From the \ntestimony and video, the story is as follows. \nAt lunchtime in the dining room, a young man complained about his food and \ndemanded a sandwich. When he was refused a sandwich, he became irate. One of the \nguards displayed a can of mace to the youth before removing him from the dining room \nand returning him to his cell. On the video, guards can be seen speaking with the young \nman through the cell bars. The young man threw liquid, reported to be toilet water, on one \nof the guards, at which point the guard reached his arm inside the cell through the bars \nand sprayed the young man with mace. Video shows the guards running off the tier but \nreturning several minutes later wearing gas masks. There were at least two other youth \n \n13 The Court’s use of the term “guards” refer to the Juvenile Justice Specialists employed by The Office of \nJuvenile Justice. \nPage 6 of 20 \n \n\nlocked in adjacent cells. The youth who was maced and the youth who are in neighboring \ncells were left in their cells for six to seven minutes. \nNelson,  now  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  the  agency,  called  the  mace  incident \nunacceptable, yet there is no evidence of any corrective training or reprimand of the \nguard.  JJS McKinley testified that she has seen mace used two to three times.  The \nrecords show that mace was used five times in July alone.14  \nFamily contact is also withheld as punishment. Dr. Lee Underwood, the designer \nof  the  treatment  program  at  Angola,  testified  that  family  engagement  is  a  critical \ncomponent of the treatment program.15  \nIn September 2022, then-Deputy Secretary William A. Sommers passionately told \nthe Court that: \nMAMAS NEED TO HUG THEIR BOYS. WHETHER THEY ARE DRIVING \nTHEM CRAZY OR NOT, WHETHER THEY'RE IN OUR FACILITIES OR \nNOT, THAT'S -- A MAMA NEEDS THAT TOUCH, THAT BOY NEEDS \nTHAT TOUCH. AND SO WE WILL HAVE THAT TYPE OF VISITATION AT \nWEST FELICIANA, NO DOUBT.16 \n \nHowever, instead of facilitating family engagement, Angola punitively withholds it.  \nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 399 is the case file of Youth #5. It documents that his mother was \nvery involved. She called and video conferenced with her son at every opportunity, but \nfor three consecutive weeks, she was told that she would not be permitted to speak with \nher son because of his behavioral infractions. \nFurther, the testimony revealed a culture of correction and punishment rather than \nrehabilitation. Juvenile Justice witnesses frequently used terms like: “call out,” “shake \n \n14 PX 89. \n15 Underwood Testimony on 9/18/23. \n16 Rec. Doc. 153, Sommers Testimony at 82:21-25. \nPage 7 of 20 \n \n\ndown,” and “lockdown.”  The Court finds that the Transitional Treatment Unit at Angola is \ndecidedly punitive and not rehabilitative. \nPromise #5 Staffing & Services \nAngola will be adequately staffed, and “SERVICES WILL BE RAMPED UP.”17 \nThe education plan calls for three teachers, but there has been one or none most \nof the time.  The Court acknowledges that one teacher resigned this past summer after \nan assault by some youth; however, this does not relieve the Office of Juvenile Justice’s \nlegal obligation to provide an appropriate education to the youth in its custody.  \nThe treatment plan calls for weekly individual counseling with a social worker. \nThere is no licensed social worker or professional counselor, and the case manager was \non site less than 50% of the time in June and July. \nThe treatment plan calls for two on-site mental health professionals. There are \nnone on site. Mental health is delivered by telemedicine, which, considering the extensive \nuse of cell restriction, is virtually unavailable. \nPromise #6 Education and Special Education \nThe promise was that Angola would have qualified teachers and provide instruction \nat a ratio of eight students to one teacher, and students would receive 360 minutes per \nday of instruction as required by state law, “lockdown notwithstanding.”  \nIn fact, there has rarely been an adequate number of teachers. For example, from \nMay 22 to July 13, there was one teacher at Angola when two were required. And the \nlogs reveal that educators were at Angola a total of eight partial days in two months; many \ntimes they were onsite for mere minutes. There is no teacher instruction provided to youth \n \n17 Rec. Doc. 152, Nelson Testimony at 165:19. \nPage 8 of 20 \n \n\nwho are locked in their cells. Instead, the youth are given workbooks which the agency \ncalls “distance learning.” \nPertaining to Special Education, he Office of Juvenile Justice promised that if a \nstudent  at  Angola  has  an  Individualized  Education  Plan,  or  IEP,  that  requires  a \npsychologist,  speech  therapist,  occupational  therapist,  or  any  other  special  service \ndeemed necessary by the IEP, such service/provider will be provided to the student.  \nThere was no evidence of the provision of any special services.  \nThe Court credits Dr. Joseph Gagnon’s expert testimony that there is a Systemic \nLack of Educational Supports at Angola, specifically:  \n  Inadequate Teacher time at facility; \n  Insufficient number of teachers;  \n  Unqualified teachers; \n  Overuse of Edgenuity, a computer based asynchronistic platform, which is also \nunavailable when a student is locked in their cell; and \n  Insufficient number of special education teachers and lack of fidelity to Individual \nEducation Plans.18 \nWhile on the topic of education, another circumstance warrants discussion. For \nseveral months, the youth incarcerated at Angola went to school in a classroom only three \nout of the six instructional hours per day. Half the population that was not on cell restriction \nwent to class in the morning and the other half went to class in the afternoon. Why? \nBecause, according to the agency, the youth “destroyed” two of the three classrooms.  \nThe  Court  now  displays  Defense  Exhibits  472  and  473.  What  is  shown  are  some \n \n18 Gagnon Testimony 8/16/23. \nPage 9 of 20 \n \n\ndamaged ceiling tiles and dislodged cameras. This is hardly the kind of damage that is \nan excuse for taking one classroom out of service for five months and another classroom \nfor over two months.  Moreover, Deputy Secretary Nelson testified that he anticipates that \nthere will be property damage from youth in secure care. By his words, he’s replaced \nliterally hundreds of television sets, and this type of acting out is just part of serving \nemotionally disturbed, traumatized youngsters.  \nThe Court finds that the agency’s abysmally slow response to making the basic \nrepairs needed, as shown by those photos, shows that the Office of Juvenile Justice is \ndeliberately indifferent to the educational rights and needs of the youth in their care at \nAngola and quick to lock youth in cells for their administrative convenience.  \nPromise # 7 Mental Health \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice promised that mental health counselors would be \nonsite at Angola eight hours a day, Monday through Friday. Counselors would be on-call \non weekends and nights. A psychiatrist would be available by telemedicine.19 \nCurrently, eleven of the youth confined to Angola were diagnosed with a “serious \nmental illness.” Yet, mental health is being delivered by telemedicine.  Mental health \nprofessionals  are  not  consulted  before  or  during  cell  restriction.  Mental  health \nprofessionals make no evaluation of the continuation of cell restriction. Mental health \nprofessionals do not round or check on the youth who are locked in their cells to determine \nwhether they are a threat to themselves or others.  Mental health professionals are not \nconsulted by staff to see if cell restriction would compromise any particular youth’s mental \nhealth treatment. \n \n19 Rec. Doc. 594, ¶ 75 (citing 9/6/22 Testimony of Dandridge).  \nPage 10 of 20 \n \n\nPromise # 8 Social Services \nThe treatment plan calls for weekly individual counseling and for “Skills training on \ninterpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance [to] occur in \ngroup counseling.”20  \nThere is no licensed social worker or professional counselor at Angola, and there \nis no evidence of any group counseling. The case manager who, according to the logs \nwas on site less than 50% of the time,21 is not qualified by education or training to counsel \nthe  youth.  The  Court  found  the  case  manager's  testimony  about  her  therapeutic \ninteractions with the youth anemic. She recounted her counseling as asking the youth \n“what's going on” or asking if they “have any issues?” The case manager is tasked well \nbeyond her education and training. \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice also told the Court that they would be adding Trust \nBased Relational Intervention therapies. There was no evidence that this was done. \nII.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nThe applicable law is set forth in the Court’s prior ruling denying Plaintiff’s First \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction and remains applicable to the pending motion.  The \nCourt therefore adopts by reference the legal standards and jurisprudence set forth in its \nSeptember 2022 Ruling22 and adopts by reference its Ruling finding that Plaintiffs have \nexhausted their administrative remedies as required by the PLRA.23    \nInjunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy, to be granted only if Plaintiffs clearly \ndemonstrate (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat \n \n20 See DX 3, 101, & 118. \n21 PX 93. \n22 See Rec. Doc. 79. \n23 Rec. Doc. 243. \nPage 11 of 20 \n \n\nthat Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) that the \nthreatened injury outweighs the threatened harm to the Defendants, and (4) that granting \nthe preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest.24  While the first two factors \nare most critical,25 the movant is required to “clearly carry the burden as to all four \nelements;” failure to do so requires a denial of the motion.26  \nA. Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1.  Section 1983 Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Constitutional Violations  \nPlaintiffs assert claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for unlawful conditions of \nconfinement and deprivation of due process.  Courts around the country have found \nincreased protections for juveniles and persons with diminished capacities from inhumane \ntreatment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.27  \na.  Conditions of Confinement \nThe Court previously followed the Fifth Circuit’s holding in Morales v. Turman that: \n“The [E]ighth [A]mendment applies to juvenile detention centers as well as to adult \nprisons.”28  Accordingly,  the  deliberate  indifference  standard  applies  to  Plaintiffs’ \nconditions of confinement claims.  Under this standard, a plaintiff must satisfy both the \n \n24 Gumns v. Edwards, No. 20-231-SDD-RLB, 2020 WL 2510248, at *3 (M.D. La.

Iowa 2015) and cases cited therein (isolation cells for juveniles \nunconstitutional). \n28 562 F.2d 993, 998 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1977). One reported district court decision within this circuit also followed \nMorales. Vega v. Parsley, 700 F. Supp. 879, 883 (W.D. Tex. 1988) (“The Fifth Circuit has held that the \nEighth Amendment applies to juvenile detention centers.” (citing Morales, supra)). \nPage 12 of 20 \n \n\nsubjective and objective requirements of the Eighth Amendment inquiry.29 To satisfy the \nobjective requirement, the plaintiff must show an “objectively intolerable risk of harm.” To \nsatisfy the subjective requirement, the plaintiff must show that the defendant: “(1) was \n‘aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious \nharm  exists’;  (2)  subjectively  ‘dr[e]w  the  inference’  that  the  risk  existed;  and  (3) \ndisregarded the risk.” \nBoth Valentine and Farmer hold that deliberate indifference requires “a subjective \n‘state  of  mind  more  blameworthy  than  negligence,’  akin  to  criminal  recklessness.”  \nHowever, systemic deficiencies in a custodial setting can provide the basis for a finding \nof deliberate indifference at an institutional level.30 The cumulative effect of different \ndeficiencies can demonstrate the subjective component of deliberate indifference, as the \nSupreme Court acknowledged in Wilson v. Seiter.31 \ni.  Objective Component  \nThe first, “objective” prong requires a showing that a person “is incarcerated under \nconditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.”32  Conditions of confinement can \nviolate the Eighth Amendment “alone or in combination.”33 If a prisoner challenges a \ncombination of conditions, he must demonstrate that the conditions have “a mutually \nenforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need.”34  \n \n29 Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797, 801 (5th Cir. 2020)(quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 846, \n114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)). \n30 See Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, 333 (5th Cir. 2004)(“Conditions of confinement may establish an Eighth \nAmendment violation ‘in combination’ when each would not do so alone, but only when they have a mutually \nenforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need . . . .”). \n31 501 U.S. 294, 300 (1991) (rejecting a distinction between “one-time” or “short-term” conditions of \nconfinement and “continuing” or “systemic” conditions). \n32 Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834. \n33 Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981). \n34 Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 at 304. \nPage 13 of 20 \n \n\nIn September 2022, this Court found as a matter of law that “Plaintiff has presented \nsufficient evidence of a serious risk of psychological harm to juveniles by placing them in \nfacilities that were designed to hold adult prisoners.”35 The plaintiffs proved that placing \nadolescents in a facility designed to house adult prisoners creates a serious risk of \npsychological harm. The Court was convinced after hearing the testimony of mental \nhealth experts at the first hearing “that transferring emotionally vulnerable adolescents, \nmany of whom have mental health issues and cognitive disfunction, to a prison camp on \nthe grounds of Angola will likely have deleterious psychological ramifications.”36 The \nCourt found that “placing any child in a maximum-security facility designed for adults is \nunreasonably psychologically harmful to children.”37  The objective standard is met. \nii.  Subjective Component \nThe “subjective” prong requires a showing that “a prison official . . . ha[s] a \nsufficiently culpable state of mind” in order to be liable under the Eighth Amendment … \nsuch a state of mind “is one of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.”38  \nThough  the  “Eighth  Amendment  requires  consciousness  of  a  risk,”39  “an  Eighth \nAmendment claimant need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act believing \nthat harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that the official failed to act despite \nhis knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm,”40 and “a factfinder may conclude that \na prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that it was obvious.”41 \n \n35 Rec. Doc. 79, p. 48-49 (“The Plaintiff presented objective evidence of a serious risk of psychological \nharm”). \n36 Rec.

The Parties in this matter agree that the goal of juvenile justice is rehabilitation, \nnot punishment. There is no dispute that when a youth is acting out, one of the last resort \noptions is physical restraint. There is no dispute that solitary confinement has a very \nnegative affect on the developing brain of adolescents; it exacerbates already existing \nmental health problems, it can exacerbate or cause the onset of mental illness and \ndepression, and it causes an increased risk of suicide. The Court finds that cell restrictions \nas used at Angola are de facto solitary confinement in both use and affect. Furthermore, \nthe Court finds that the cell restrictions as used on the youth at Angola meet the statutory \ndefinition of solitary confinement in La. R. S. 15:905, which states: “the involuntary \nplacement of a juvenile alone in a cell, room, or other area, except during regular sleeping \nhours.” The state law which proscribes solitary confinement of juveniles and the Deputy \n \n42 Id. at 842-43. \n43 Lewis v.

The Court concludes that The Office of \nJuvenile Justice was aware of and indifferent to the serious harm caused by excessively \nconfining adolescents in their cells. \nb.  Denial of Due Process – Punishment \nIt is the public policy of the state of Louisiana that commitment of a juvenile to the \ncare of the Office of Juvenile Justice “is not punitive nor is it in any way to be construed \nas a penal sentence, but as a step in the total treatment process toward rehabilitation of \nthe juvenile[.]”44  According to the Louisiana Supreme Court, “the unique nature of the \njuvenile system is manifested in its noncriminal, or civil, nature, its focus on rehabilitation \nand individual treatment rather than retribution, and the state's role as parens patriae in \nmanaging the welfare of the juvenile in state custody.”45 \nLike a pretrial detainee, a juvenile can demonstrate that he was subjected to \nunconstitutional punishment in either of two ways: (1) by showing “an expressed intent to \npunish on the part of the detention facility officials,” or (2) by showing that a restriction or \ncondition is not rationally related to a legitimate government objective or is excessive in \nrelation to that purpose.46   \nThe Court finds that excessively confining adolescents in their cells, the untrained \nand undocumented use of handcuffs, the use of mace in the manner depicted in Exhibit \n440, and the systematic denial of family interactions for punitive reasons violate the \nFourteenth Amendment.  \n \n44 La.

Violations of the ADA and RA \nTo  succeed  on  claims  under  Title  II  of  the  ADA  and  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs must show that: 1) they have a qualifying disability; 2) that \nthey were denied the benefits of certain programs, services, or activities for which a public \nentity is responsible; 3) that any discrimination is by reason of their disability; and 4) that \nthe public entity in question receives federal financial assistance.47  \nA person with a disability, under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, is any \nindividual who has a “physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more \nmajor life activities” that is recorded or which an individual is regarded as having.48  Major \nlife  activities  include  “learning,  reading,  concentrating,  thinking,  communicating,  and \nworking.”49  \nDefendants The Office of Juvenile Justice and DPSC/DOC are public entities \nregulated by Section 504 and the ADA.50  Named Plaintiffs and the Disabilities Subclass \nqualify as persons with disabilities under the ADA and Section 504 of the RA, as they \nhave learning disabilities and/or mental health disabilities, including PTSD, that impact \nmajor life activities such as sleeping, concentrating, thinking, and learning.51   \n“The ADA recognizes a ‘methods of administration’ claim that prohibits public \nentities from using “criteria or methods of administration . . .

Substantial Threat of Irreparable Injury \n“‘Irreparable harm requires a showing that: (1) the harm to Plaintiff[] is imminent \n(2) the injury would be irreparable and (3) that Plaintiff[] ha[s] no other adequate legal \nremedy.”’53  The Court previously held that Plaintiffs satisfied this prong, and the current \nrecord further supports this finding in the following ways:  1) the psychological harm of \nbeing in adult prison cell has already been heavily detailed by the Court; 2) there is new \nevidence of the excessive and/or unwarranted use cell restriction/macing which further \ndemonstrates psychological harm; and 3) the lack of education, mental health, and \nrehabilitative services furthers the harm to children and sets them back even further. \nC. Balance of Harms/Public Interest Factors \nThe final two elements of the preliminary injunction standard—the balance of the \nharms and whether an injunction will disserve the public interest—may be considered \ntogether. “These factors merge when the Government is the opposing party.”54 Courts \n“must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party \nof  the  granting  or  withholding  of  the  requested  relief.”55  “In  exercising  their  sound \n \n52 Tellis, 2021 WL 4267513, at *8 (internal citations omitted). \n53 J.H. by and through N.H. v.

Bond \nA federal court may waive the bond requirement pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(c).62 The Court finds that waiving the bond is appropriate in this case; the \nplaintiffs are indigent,63 and the Plaintiffs have brought this suit to enforce constitutional \nrights.64 Accordingly, no bond is imposed. \nIII.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \nALEX A., by and through his guardian, Molly   \nSmith, individually and on behalf of all others   \nsimilarly situated,   \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n  Civil Action No.  \nv.   \n   \nGOVERNOR JON BEL EDWARDS, in his  Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory \nofficial capacity as Governor of Louisiana;  Relief—Class Action \nWILLIAM SOMMERS, in his official   \ncapacity as Deputy Secretary of the Office of   \nJuvenile Justice, JAMES M. LEBLANC, in  IMMEDIATE RELIEF SOUGHT \nhis official capacity as Secretary of the   \nLouisiana Department of Public Safety &    \nCorrections, \n \nDefendants. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n1. \nSince 1974, with the passage of the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct (JJDPA), Congress recognized that young people should not be incarcerated in adult jails or \nprisons.  Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (JJDP) Act (Pub. L. No. 93-415), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 5601 et seq.  If ever youth are held in adult facilities under temporary and limited circumstances, \nthere must be sight and sound separation from detained and incarcerated adults. The JJDPA \nrequires that juveniles not be confined in any institution where they may have contact with adult \ninmates.  Known as one JJDPA’s core protections, sight and sound separation “mandates that \nincarcerated youths may not be placed in situations in which they have any clear visual or verbal \ncontact that is `not brief and inadvertent’ with adult incarcerated persons.”   \n2. \nOn July 19, 2022, at a press conference called to address the failings of one of the state’s \n1 \n \n\njuvenile facilities, Gov. Jon Bel Edwards declared that the state will “temporarily move” youth in \nthe custody of the Office of Juvenile Justice (“OJJ”) from a juvenile secure care facility to the \nLouisiana State Penitentiary (LSP).  Although Gov. Edwards claimed that the youth would be held \nin a separate location at LSP, would not have any contact with adults incarcerated at LSP, and that \nyouth transferred to LSP will have counseling, educational programming, and other services, those \nclaims are unsupported by any plan.  As one former top OJJ official noted, the move to transfer \nyouth from juvenile facilities to LSP is “abhorrent” and “the worst juvenile justice policy decision \nprobably ever made in modern times.” \n3.   \nAlmost five thousand men are incarcerated at LSP, with over eighty-four percent of the \npopulation locked up for crimes of violence.  LSP is commonly referred to as Angola due to its \norigins as a forced labor camp before the Civil War, when it was called the “Angola Plantations.”  \nGiven the fact that 83% of youth in OJJ’s secure care system are Black, it is statistically likely that \nBlack youth will disproportionately suffer the brunt of the Governor’s transfer plan. \n4. \nLSP cannot provide basic, humane care for the adults within its gates.  In 2021, Chief Judge \nShelly Dick of this Court found in Lewis v. Cain “that [the Louisiana State Penitentiary] lacks the \ninfrastructure necessary to provide a constitutionally adequate health care system for patients with \nserious  medical  needs,”  and  “overwhelming  deficiencies  in  the  medical  leadership  and \nadministration of health care at [the prison] contributes to these constitutional violations.”  In \naddition to regular COVID-19 outbreaks, LSP is currently under a boil water alert due to broken \ninfrastructure.  If LSP cannot protect the constitutional rights of the almost five thousand adults in \n2 \n \n\nits custody and care, it will not be to provide care to Plaintiff Alex A. 1 and the other youth placed \nthere.   \n5. \nUnder Louisiana law, youth in the OJJ are adjudicated delinquent, which is a civil law \nadjudication.  Young people are not convicted of a crime, and they are protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Arbitrarily transferring young people under OJJ jurisdiction \nto LSP, a place with thousands of people convicted of crimes under Louisiana law and sentenced \nto hard labor, is clearly punishment, which is not permitted for those who are civilly detained, and \nviolates young people’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendants’ \nunconstitutional actions place Plaintiff Alex A. and members of the class at risk of unspeakable \nharm and lifelong trauma.   \n6 \nPlaintiff Alex A., along with other putative class members, is a student who meets the \ndefinition of a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and previously had an \nIndividual Accommodations Plan.  As a result of his disability, he is entitled to receive educational \naccommodations and other services under federal law to ensure equal and nondiscriminatory \naccess to the classroom.  As a maximum-security adult prison, LSP does not have a school capable \nof providing those services and Defendants have provided no plan for doing so, despite being given \nmultiple opportunities to provide information about their plan. \n7. \nYoung people who are the target of Defendants’ commitment to transfer youth to LSP, \nincluding Plaintiff Alex A., are anxious and in fear for their safety as a result of Defendants’ \n \n1  Alex A. is pseudonym and files this suit by and through his mother, Molly Smith.  \n3 \n \n\nactions.  Because  Defendants’  actions  constitute  ongoing,  systemic  violations  of  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional and statutory rights, Plaintiffs seek class-wide relief enjoining Defendants from \ntransferring any youth, including Plaintiff Alex A., to LSP, and to prevent Defendants from \nincarcerating any youth adjudicated delinquent in LSP.  In addition, as set forth in Plaintiff’s \nrequest for emergency relief, Plaintiff requests that any youth who have already been transferred \nto LSP be transferred back to BCCY or another appropriate OJJ facility for youth. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8. \nThis action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution, and, for members of the putative subclass of youth with disabilities, \nunder Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  This Court has subject \nmatter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343 and 2201. \n9. \nVenue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because the events and omissions giving rise \nto these claims occurred and continue to occur in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n10. \nPLAINTIFF ALEX A. is a 17-year-old male currently under juvenile court jurisdiction.  \nHe is currently in the secure custody of OJJ at the Bridge City Correctional Center for Youth \n(BCCY), where he participates in the LAMOD program and is not involved with the JUMP \nprogram. Alex A. (Plaintiff) has been informed that he, along with approximately 24 other youth \nin BCCY, will be transferred to LSP imminently.  \n \n4 \n \n\n11. \nWhile at BCCY, Plaintiff attends school every weekday for five hours, during which he \ntakes social studies, math, English, and science.  He has different teachers and changes classrooms \nfor each subject.  As a student with a disability, he receives classroom accommodations to help \nhim access material in the classroom, including the use of a calculator and read aloud services.  He \nalso has the assistance of a special education teacher in his classes who helps to deliver his services.  \nIn addition to regular school, he is provided with opportunities to explore his hobbies by reading \nat the library and exploring books about sports and life in the city.  He receives intensive counseling \nand treatment services at BCCY, including participating in group counseling three times a week \nfor an hour, individual counseling for at least thirty minutes twice a week, and meeting every two \nweeks with a social worker to discuss skills like coping and anger management.  \n12. \nPlaintiff is a child with a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  He has \nbeen diagnosed with a learning disability, and also has been prescribed medication to address post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, to help him sleep, and to address nightmares.  \n13. \nPlaintiff first learned that he and his peers would be moved to LSP while watching \ntelevision news at BCCY.  Since then, he has experienced significant mental and physical harm, \nincluding increased difficulty sleeping and extreme stress.  During sleepless nights, he has started \nto pull out his hair.  Plaintiff fears that he will be subjected to unsafe conditions and violence at \nLSP.  Already, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (DOC) staff that have \nbeen brought into BCCY have begun using mace on Plaintiff and the other youth at the facility \nand he is afraid these actions will only intensify at LSP.  Additionally, Plaintiff is concerned that \n5 \n \n\nhe will not receive the same level of treatment, counseling, and education he receives at BCCY. \nLike Plaintiff, his peers at BCCY are also terrified of being moved to LSP.  Plaintiff has seen his \npeers break down and cry because of their fear of being moved to LSP.  \n14. \nStaff members at OJJ have continually told Plaintiff that he will be imminently moved to \nLSP.  When the decision to move BCCY youth to Angola was first announced, Plaintiff was \ninformed by BCCY employees that he would be moved within a week or two of the announcement.  \nLater, he was informed that he and his peers would be moved to LSP on August 15 or August 16.  \nWhen that did not happen, staff members told him that he would be moved “any day now.”  Based \non these representations, Plaintiff reasonably believes that the move is imminent and could happen \nat any time.  \n15. \nPlaintiff  filed  an  Emergency  Grievance  pursuant  to  OJJ’s  Administrative  Remedy \nProcedure (ARP) on Tuesday, August 16, 2022.  Despite the imminent nature of Plaintiff’s \nanticipated move to LSP and the serious physical and psychological harm Plaintiff is already \nexperiencing as a result, OJJ responded on August 18, 2022 by stating that Plaintiff is “not subject \nto any immediate risk of harm” and therefore his ARP would be reviewed “within the regular ARP \ntime limits.”  OJJ’s failure to properly treat Plaintiff’s grievance as an emergency grievance that \nrequires an expedited timeline has made the grievance process unavailable to Plaintiff.   As a result, \nPlaintiff has exhausted all available administrative remedies and represents the Class in this action. \n16. \nAlex A. brings his lawsuit through his mother and next friend, Molly Smith, who is an \nadult resident of the state of Louisiana.  Molly Smith brings this action on Alex A.’s behalf \n6 \n \n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2).  Ms. Smith is dedicated to the best interests of Alex A. and \nwill advocate for those best interests in this action.  Like her son, Ms. Smith is deeply concerned \nabout Defendants’ imminent plan to move youth to LSP.  Ms. Smith is terrified that her son will \nbe locked in a windowless cell for 24 hours a day, or that he will be exposed to adults who are \nincarcerated at LSP.  She is also concerned that Plaintiff will be deprived of the education, medical \nand mental health treatment, and rehabilitative services he requires when he is moved to LSP.  \n17. \nDEFENDANT GOVERNOR JON BEL EDWARDS (Defendant Edwards) is an adult \nresident of Louisiana.  Defendant Edwards is the Governor of Louisiana and responsible for the \nfaithful execution of the laws of Louisiana.  In addition, he is responsible for appointments of the \nSecretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections and Deputy Secretary of \nthe Office of Juvenile Justice.  Defendant Edwards is a final juvenile justice policymaker who at \ntimes delegates policymaking authority to other Defendants named in this lawsuit.  At all pertinent \ntimes, Defendant Edwards was acting under color of law.  Defendant Edwards is being sued in his \nofficial capacity as Governor of Louisiana. \n18. \nDEFENDANT  WILLIAM SOMMERS (Defendant Sommers) is  an adult resident of \nLouisiana.  Defendant Sommers is the Deputy Secretary of the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nresponsible for the development and execution of Louisiana’s juvenile justice policy who at times \ndelegates policymaking authority to others in the OJJ.  At all pertinent times, Defendant Sommers \nwas acting under color of law.  Defendant Sommers is being sued in his official capacity as the \nDeputy Secretary of the Office of Juvenile Justice.   \n \n7 \n \n\n19. \nDefendant JAMES M. LEBLANC (Defendant LeBlanc) is an adult resident of Louisiana.  \nDefendant LeBlanc is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections \n(DOC) and responsible for the development and execution of Louisiana’s adult criminal justice \npolicy who at times delegates policymaking authority to others in the DOC.  At all pertinent times, \nDefendant LeBlanc was acting under color of law.  Defendant LeBlanc is being sued in his official \ncapacity as the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections. \nTHE GRAVE RISK OF HARM POSED BY THE TRANSFER OF YOUTH  \nTO A NOTORIUS ADULT PRISON REQUIRES AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE \n \n20. \nDecades of research demonstrates the serious harms youth experience when they are \nincarcerated in adult jails and prisons.  Youth in adult facilities are more likely to commit suicide, \nmore likely to suffer from sexual assault and trauma, and more likely to experience exacerbated \nmental health challenges.  These experiences can lead to long-term consequences for the mental \nand physical health of vulnerable youth in the juvenile and criminal legal system, many of whom \nhave experienced significant trauma that can impact their responses to their surroundings.    As \none former top OJJ official has explained, even just informing youth that they will be placed at an \nadult  facility  is  likely  to  cause  “mental  anguish”  for  youth  who  have  already  experienced \nsignificant trauma in their lives. \n21. \nYouth in adult facilities are also more likely than their peers in juvenile facilities to be \nsubjected to solitary confinement.  Although adult prisons often rely on solitary confinement as a \nway to keep youth safe from incarcerated adults, it leads to serious and harmful consequences for \nvulnerable youth.  Solitary confinement – even for only two days-- has been linked to increased \n8 \n \n\nrates of suicide, depression, and anxiety.  These harmful outcomes are amplified in youth.   Indeed, \nyouth in particular are especially vulnerable to severe mental and physical harm as a result of \nsolitary confinement, including developmental delay and psychosis.   When youth are placed in \nsolitary  confinement,  they  are  frequently  not  given  access  to  education  and  mental  health \nprogramming, and they are not permitted to communicate with their families.  As a result, they are \nnot  able  to  participate  in  the  rehabilitative  programming  necessary  for  their  growth  and \ndevelopment. \n22. \nAs a maximum-security prison notorious for unsafe and violent conditions, and its overuse \nof  solitary  confinement  for  the  people  incarcerated  in  LSP,  youth  transferred  to  LSP  will \nexperience these serious and well-documented harms, leading to grave consequences.  Even short \nperiods of time in adult facilities have been linked to high rates of suicide as well as serious \nparanoia, anxiety, and depression for youth.  Because LSP is not equipped to provide education, \nmental health programming, or other forms of rehabilitation, youth moved to LSP will also be less \nlikely to progress on their rehabilitative journey so that they can return home to their families \nhealthy and whole.  \nDEFENDANTS MAY NOT RESPOND TO THE PROBLEMS IN \nLOUISIANA’S SECURE CARE SYSTEM BY PLACING YOUTH \n IN CONDITIONS THAT HEIGHTEN RISK OF HARM TO YOUTH \n \n23. \nDefendants have experienced operational failings in Louisiana’s secure care system for \nyouth  which  have  been  well-documented.    Defendants  acknowledge  that  these  operational \ndeficiencies have caused a situation at BCCY in which they are not properly caring for youth in \nOJJ’s custody there.  \n9 \n \n\n24. \nInstead of identifying the failures and taking steps to remedy them, Defendants have \nannounced an ill-thought-out and unplanned response, namely to transfer scores of vulnerable \nyouth to a notorious adult prison. \n25. \nIf Defendants cannot lawfully provide rehabilitative care to youth in their secure care \nfacilities, they have other responses available.  \n26. \nAmong these responses, Defendants are able to review youth in secure care who may be \neligible for release and facilitate their release to alternatives to secure detention in order to reduce \nfacility population, thus allowing Defendants to provide appropriate care and services to the \nPlaintiff and Class members in danger of transfer to LSP. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n27. \nThe Named Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated \nas a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \n28. \nThe class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as all current and future persons held \nat BCCY who might be transferred to LSP or another adult prison.  \n29. \nPlaintiff also seeks to represent a subclass of all current and future persons with disabilities \nwho are held at BCCY who might be transferred to LSP or another adult prison. \n \n10 \n \n\n30. \nThis action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule \n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  This action satisfies the requirements of numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n31. \nAs of July 19, 2022, BCCY confined at least 25 young people, all of whom are eligible \nmembers of the Class.  In addition, BCCY releases and accepts new youth on a weekly basis, \nmeeting the numerosity requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).  Plaintiff and other \nproposed subclass members are youth with disabilities within the meaning of Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  Given that up to 70% of youth in detention have educational or other \ndisabilities, there is a sufficient number of proposed subclass members who are now or will be \nplaced at BCCY to satisfy the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a).  \n32. \nJoinder is impracticable because the class members are numerous and shifting; the class is \nfluid due to the inherently transitory nature of BCCY’s population; and the class members are \nincarcerated and low-income, which limits their ability to institute individual lawsuits.  Certifying \nthis class supports judicial economy.  \n33.   \nCommon questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class.  The Named \nPlaintiff seeks common declarative and injunctive relief concerning whether Defendants’ policies, \npractices, and procedures violate the constitutional and statutory rights of the class members.  \nThese common questions of fact and law include whether the transfer of youth adjudicated \ndelinquent and not convicted of any crime may be transferred to LSP. \n11 \n \n\n34.   \nNamed Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the class members’ claims.  The injuries that the \nNamed Plaintiff has suffered due to Defendants’ unconstitutional course of conduct are typical of \nthe injuries suffered by the class.  All class members seek the same declaratory and injunctive \nrelief. \n35. \nThe Named Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the class and the subclass because his \ninterests in the vindication of the legal claims he raises are entirely aligned with the interests of \nthe other class members, each of whom has the same constitutional (and, for the subclass, statutory) \nclaims.  There are no known conflicts of interest among members of the proposed class, and the \ninterests of the Named Plaintiff does not conflict with those of the other class members. \n36. \nPlaintiff is represented by counsel with experience and success in litigating complex civil \nrights matters in federal court.  The interests of the members of the class will be fairly and \nadequately protected by the Named Plaintiff and his attorneys. \n37. \nBecause the putative class challenges Defendants’ system as unconstitutional through \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that would apply the same relief to every member of the class, \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate and necessary. \n38. \nA class action is the only practicable means by which the Named Plaintiff and class \nmembers  can  challenge  the  Defendants’  unconstitutional  actions  and  obtain  the  necessary \nimmediate declaratory and injunctive relief sought for themselves and all other members of the \n12 \n \n\nclass. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nCOUNT I (on behalf of Alex A. and the proposed class): Declaratory and \nInjunctive Relief for Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \nBy transferring youth adjudicated delinquent to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at \nAngola, a maximum-security adult prison, Defendants violate their duty to provide conditions of \nreasonable health and safety to the youth it holds in its custody, and demonstrate deliberate \nindifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiffs, in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Defendants’ actions are also \npunishment of Plaintiffs in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCOUNT II (on behalf of Alex A. and the proposed subclass): Declaratory and \nInjunctive Relief for Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n \nBy transferring youth adjudicated delinquent to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at \nAngola, a maximum-security adult prison, where required educational and rehabilitative services \nfor Plaintiffs with disabilities cannot be provided, Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ rights under \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Putative Class Members respectfully request that the \nCourt: \nA.  Certify the proposed class and subclass; \nB.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Defendants are violating Named Plaintiff’s and \nClass Members’ constitutional rights (and, for Plaintiff and subclass members, \nfederal statutory rights) by transferring them to a notoriously dangerous maximum \nsecurity adult prison, LSP, without a plan to provide counseling, education, other \n13 \n \n\nrehabilitative services, and sufficient safety from adult people incarcerated at LSP; \nC.  Issue  a  temporary  restraining  order,  preliminary  injunction,  and  permanent \ninjunction, requiring Defendants to cease plans to transfer Plaintiff and Class \nMembers to LSP, and to  immediately release or transfer the Plaintiff and any Class \nMembers who have already been moved to LSP back to one of OJJ’s secure care \nfacilities. \nD.
