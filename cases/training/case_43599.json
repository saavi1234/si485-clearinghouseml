    "summary": "<h3>Background</h3>\r\n<p>This is a case about accessibility for people with disabilities in senior living communities. On December 11, 2020, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed this lawsuit against fourteen companies who had designed, built, and/or owned fifteen buildings that housed independent living, assisted living, and memory care communities. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The DOJ sued the defendants under the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), alleging that these facilities contained numerous violations that made them inaccessible for people with disabilities, and that this was a pattern or practice of discrimination by the defendants. They sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and monetary damages. The case was initially heard by Judge Joseph F. Leeson, Jr. However, Judge John M. Gallagher took over the case on April 7, 2022.</p>\r\n<h3>Complaint</h3>\r\n<p>The DOJ relied on property plans and inspections to allege that the buildings had been constructed and designed with inaccessible multifamily units and public spaces; the former violated the Fair Housing Act, and the latter violated both the Fair Housing Act and the ADA. In the complaint, the DOJ listed numerous alleged violations at each building. In public areas, the violations included various barriers that made the areas inaccessible for people using wheelchairs, such as high slopes on walkways and around accessible parking spaces, inaccessible routes to public amenities, high shelves and mailboxes, too little space around automatic door switches, and inaccessible public bathrooms. The DOJ alleged similarly inaccessible features in the units, including narrow doorways, inaccessible paths within rooms, bathrooms and kitchens without enough floor space, high electrical controls, and shower walls on which grab bars could not be installed.</p>\r\n<p>The DOJ asked the court for declaratory judgment that the defendants had violated the Fair Housing Act and the ADA, and for injunctions requiring the defendants to retrofit their buildings to make them compliant as well as to ensure any future buildings they designed or built would be compliant. The DOJ also requested monetary damages to people who had been discriminated against by the defendants, as well as a civil penalty against the defendants.</p>\r\n<p>There were three types of defendants in the case: the architectural firm that had designed the buildings, eight companies that had owned the buildings and been part of the design and construction process, and six companies that owned some of the buildings but had not been part of the design and construction process. The last were Rule 19 defendants, meaning that they had to be added to the lawsuit so that the relief the DOJ wanted, such as retrofits to the buildings, would be possible.</p>\r\n<p>On March 1, 2021, the DOJ filed an amended complaint to fix the name of a defendant. A few weeks later, on March 22, the DOJ voluntarily dismissed the defendants Two Douglassville Properties and Care HSL Newtown Propco. About two weeks later, on April 8, a default was entered for the defendant AMC Delancey Traditions of Hershey Partners, which had failed to respond to the lawsuit. Two weeks later, on April 23, the DOJ again amended its complaint to remove the two defendants that it had voluntarily dismissed, and to add an additional defendant.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, April 23, the court granted the DOJ's unopposed motion to stay the case for 150 days so the parties could negotiate settlements. On September 14 of the same year, the court extended the stay for another two months. Two months later, on November 24, the court extended the stay until the parties had completed mediation in late February 2022. Another stay was granted on July 20, 2022, which was later extended through September 19, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2022, the architectural firm, J. Randolph Parry Architects, filed a third-party complaint in which they alleged that the buildings&rsquo; violations were largely the fault of other parties rather than the firm itself. The firm sought to add thirty-nine other defendants that it alleged were at fault, including construction, engineering, and interior design firms. The firm also made three state law crossclaims against every other defendant in the case. The firm requested that the court exercise supplemental jurisdiction to bring these many state law claims into the present lawsuit. Later that month, on March 28, several defendants moved to dismiss the firm&rsquo;s crossclaims, and two days later the DOJ filed a motion to strike or dismiss the third-party complaint.</p>\r\n<p>Two months later, on May 24, the court granted the motion to dismiss filed by various parties against the architectural firm&rsquo;s crossclaims and third-party complaint. The court held that including the numerous crossclaims and third-party claims would cause them to predominate over the original case, and that those claims involved many issues not relevant to the lawsuit. Therefore, the court declined to hear the architectural firm&rsquo;s state law claims.</p>\r\n<p>On April 29, 2022, J. Randolph Parry Architects moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the DOJ&rsquo;s lawsuit was barred by the federal statute of limitations and state statutes of repose because the alleged violations had occurred too many years ago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Two months later, on June 22, the court denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings from the architectural firm. The firm had alleged that a five-year federal statute of limitations and ten- and twelve-year statutes of repose in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, respectively, prevented the DOJ from suing over properties that had been designed and built more than five, ten, or twelve years ago, which included several of the buildings in the lawsuit. However, the court held that since at least one of the buildings had been constructed within the statutes of limitations and repose, the laws did not prevent the DOJ from alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination that included all of the buildings that were part of that pattern or practice, even if some of them were constructed outside the statutes of limitations and repose.</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2022, DOJ and J. Randolph Parry Architects agreed to a consent decree. The architectural firm paid $350,000 towards retrofits on the buildings, $75,000 in damages to those who had been discriminated against, and $25,000 as a civil penalty. It also agreed to a general injunction against discriminating in violation of the Fair Housing Act and ADA, and to a program for educating its employees about these laws. The firm was also required to inform the DOJ about the compliance of future projects, and to file yearly reports. The decree is slated to last forty-two months, until March 2026. The Court retained jurisdiction for enforcement purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2024, AMC Delancey Traditions of Hershey Partners, LP was voluntarily dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2024, the case was marked closed for administrative purposes</p>\r\n<h3>Consent Decrees</h3>\r\n<h4>1180 &nbsp;Ben Franklin Way</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;November 21, 2021&ndash; Consent Decree between DOJ and Rule 19 defendant 1180 Ben Franklin Way. Ben Franklin Way agreed to let the DOJ access the building they owned and to let retrofits take place in their building if another defendant agreed to or was ordered to make retrofits. The decree would end either if either six months passed after the retrofits were done or if the case against Ben Franklin Way was dismissed.</p>\r\n<h4>LifeQuest Nursing Center&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>April 13, 2022: Consent Decree between DOJ and LifeQuest Nursing Center.

It also paid $24,000 in damages to those discriminated against, and $14,000 as a civil penalty. The decree included a requirement that LifeQuest give quarterly reports, as well as reports on the compliance of any future building projects. The agreement contained other requirements, including that LifeQuest would educate its employees about Fair Housing Act and ADA compliance, inform past and present residents of the settlement, post signs about its non-discrimination policy in rental offices, and include a statement about accessibility on any advertising. The order would last until six months after the retrofits were done, or until the litigation ended, whichever came last.</p>\r\n<h4>J.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  This action is brought by the United States to enforce provisions of the Fair Housing \nAct (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12181-12189.  Specifically, the United States’ Second Amended Complaint alleges that \nDefendants have engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against persons with disabilities \nand denied rights to a group of persons because of disability by failing to design and construct \ncovered multifamily dwellings with the features of accessible and adaptive design and construction \nrequired by the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3), and as required by the ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12183(a)(1).  See ECF No. 41.  These covered multifamily dwelling units include \nproperties for seniors, including independent living, assisted living, and memory support dwelling \nunits.   \n2.  The United States and Defendant, One Newtown Properties, LP, a Pennsylvania \nlimited partnership (“One Newtown” or “Defendant”), have entered into this Consent Order \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 2 of 58\n(hereinafter “Order”) (collectively “Parties”) and agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the \nsubject matter of this case under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and \n12188(b)(1)(B).  The Parties further agree that this controversy should be resolved without further \nproceedings and without an evidentiary hearing or a trial. \n3.  Specifically, as to One Newtown, the United States alleges that One Newtown \nengaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination and a denial of rights based on disability when \nit failed to design and construct the Birches of Newtown with the accessibility features required \nby the FHA and ADA.  The United States’ Second Amended Complaint alleges that accessibility \nviolations at the Birches at Newtown include, but are not limited to, barriers at accessible routes, \nbarriers at common-use laundry rooms, activity rooms, and amenities, unit closets that are too \nnarrow, and insufficient clear floor space in unit bathrooms.   \n4.  One  Newtown  denies  that  it  engaged  in  any  form  of  intentional  or  willful \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities and states that at all times it has attempted to \ncomply with all applicable federal laws, including those requiring accessibility such as the FHA \nand ADA, in design and construction of the Birches at Newtown by, inter alia, contracting with \nexperienced  design  and  construction  professionals.  One  Newtown  acknowledges  that  its \nobligations to comply with the FHA and the ADA are non-delegable, and it must comply with the \nFHA and  the ADA itself despite  assurances of compliance with all applicable laws, rules, \nregulations, guidelines, and ordinances made by these design and construction professionals.  \n5.  The Parties agree that this Order is being entered into by One Newtown as a \ncompromise of disputed claims, and to avoid the cost and burden of litigation, and should not be \ndeemed an admission of liability by One Newtown.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 3 of 58\n6.  As indicated by the signatures appearing below, the Parties agree to the entry of \nthis Order. \nII.  DEFINITIONS \n7.  “Subject Property” means the Birches at Newtown (“Birches at Newtown”), a \nmemory care and personal care facility located at 70 Durham Road, Newtown, PA 18904 and \nreferred to in the Complaint, as amended, as “the Birches.” \n8.  “Defendant” means One Newtown Properties, LP (“One Newtown”).  \n9.  “Accessible Design Requirements” means the requirements that are listed in the \naccessible and adaptive design provisions of the FHA and stated in paragraph 15.  \n10.  “Inspection Report” is the report created after the implementation of the retrofits \nrequired in Appendices A and B, and Neutral Inspection by an inspector which will describe any \ndeficiencies in the required retrofits at the Subject Property, including digital photographs.  \nIII.  RECITALS \nA.  Subject Property \n11.  As set forth herein, and in the Second Amended Complaint, One Newtown owned \nthe Birches at Newtown at the time of its the design and construction. The Birches at Newtown is \na 91-unit memory care and personal care facility that offers various amenities to its residents. Care \nHSL Newtown PropCo LP is the current owner and operator of the Birches at Newtown.  \n12.  For purposes of this Order, the Parties agree that the Birches at Newtown is subject \nto the accessible design and construction requirements of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1), (f)(2), \nand (f)(3), and the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1).   \nB.  Relevant Requirements of the Fair Housing Act \n13.  The FHA provides that, for residential buildings with an elevator consisting of four \nor more dwelling units, all units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after March \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 4 of 58\n13, 1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible \nand adaptive design to make such units accessible to or adaptable for use by persons with \ndisabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(A). \n14.  The FHA provides that, for non-elevator residential buildings with four or more \ndwelling units, all ground-floor units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after \nMarch 13, 1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of \naccessible and adaptive design to make such units accessible to or adaptable for use by persons \nwith disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(B). \n15.  The  Accessible  Design  Requirements  in  the  FHA  for  covered  multifamily \ndwellings include: (i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings must be readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (ii) all the doors designed to allow passage \ninto and within all premises within such dwellings must be sufficiently wide to allow passage by \npersons with a disability using wheelchairs; (iii) all premises within such dwellings must contain \nthe following features of adaptive design: (I) an accessible route into and through the dwelling; \n(II) light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible \nlocations; (III) reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and (IV) \nusable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about the \nspace.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).   \n16.  For the purposes of this Order, One Newtown agrees that the Subject Property was \ndesigned and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, and therefore all the units in \nbuildings with elevators and the ground-floor units in non-elevator buildings at the Subject \nProperty are “covered multifamily dwellings” within the meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § \n3604(f)(7)(A) and (B).  As such, those units and the public and common use areas, including the \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 5 of 58\naccessible pedestrian routes at the Subject Property, must comply with the Accessible Design \nRequirements of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).   \nC.  Relevant Requirements of the ADA \n17.  The ADA and the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, ADA Accessibility \nGuidelines for Buildings and Facilities, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A (“ADA Standards”), that have \nbeen issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Department”) to implement the design and \nconstruction requirements of Title III of the ADA, also require that all “public accommodations” \ndesigned  and constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, and the goods, services, \nfacilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of those public accommodations, be readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with certain accessibility \nstandards promulgated under that Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12182(a) and 12183(a)(1).  A rental or sales \noffice for an apartment, condominium, or patio home complex is a “public accommodation”  under \nthe ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E).   \n18.  For the purposes of this Order, One Newtown agrees that the rental offices at the \nSubject Property were designed and constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, and \ntherefore the rental offices and the facilities and privileges provided at those offices, such as public \nparking, are required to be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards promulgated \nunder the ADA. \nACCORDINGLY, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED: \nIV.

One Newtown and its officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns, and all \nother persons in active concert or participation with them, are enjoined from discriminating on the \nbasis of disability as prohibited by the FHA and the ADA.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 6 of 58\nV.  RETROFITS  \n20.  The United States, as set forth herein and in its Second Amended Complaint, alleges \nthat the Subject Property does not meet the accessibility requirements of the FHA and, with respect \nto the sales and rental offices, the ADA, and the ADA Standards.  See ECF No. 41.  To address \nthe United States’ allegations, One Newtown will complete the actions and retrofits described in \nthis Section.  \n21.  As soon as reasonably possible, but not later than twenty-four (24) months from the \nentry of this Order, One Newtown will complete the retrofits to the Subject Property identified in \nAppendices A and B.   \n22.  If any architectural or engineering drawings are prepared as part of the retrofitting \nof the Subject Property, One Newtown will provide those drawings to the United States for \ncomment and approval within fourteen (14) days of their preparation.  The United States will \nprovide comments within forty-five (45) days.  One Newtown will incorporate those comments \ninto any relevant architectural or engineering plans and resubmit those to the United States for \napproval.  This process will continue until the United States has no further comments on any \nretrofit architectural or engineering plans.    \nVI.  INCONVENIENCE  AND  OVERNIGHT  STAYS  FOR  RETROFITTING  AT \nSUBJECT PROPERTIES \n23.  One Newtown will endeavor to minimize inconvenience to residents in scheduling \nand performing retrofits required by this Order at the Subject Property.   \n24.  Within thirty (30) days from the entry of this Order, One Newtown will provide a \nnotice that is substantially equivalent to Appendix C to Care HSL Newtown Propco LP to provide \nto the present residents of the covered dwelling units at the Subject Property.  The notice will \ninform residents in covered dwelling units that (1) the United States alleges that the covered \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 7 of 58\ndwelling units and public and common use areas do not meet the requirements of the FHA, the \nADA, and the ADA Standards; (2) One Newtown denies these allegations but has agreed to \ncooperate with the United States, and to resolve these allegations, One Newtown has agreed to \nperform certain retrofits to the public and common use areas and the covered dwelling units; (3) \nthe covered dwelling unit must be retrofitted within twenty-four (24) months; (4) One Newtown \nwill provide residents with a schedule of when the retrofits will be performed; (5) the retrofits will \nbe performed at no cost to the resident; and (6) One Newtown will, in consultation with the current \nowner, offer any resident of a unit scheduled to undergo a retrofit who will be dislocated from their \nunit for more than twelve hours consecutively a fully furnished unit at the property if one is \navailable.    If  no  unit  is  available,  or  relocation  of  the  resident  is  not  feasible  given  the \ncircumstances of the resident, One Newtown will be relieved of the time limitation in which to \ncomplete retrofits for that particular unit, and the retrofit inspection procedures described in \nParagraphs 26 - 29 below can proceed without completion of the retrofits to that particular unit.  \nThe required retrofits must be completed to the unit when turned for a new resident, or three \nmonths prior to the end of the current term of this Order, whichever is sooner.  Photographic \nevidence in compliance with the requirements of Appendix D of the retrofits performed at those \nspecific  units  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  sufficient  evidence  of  the  retrofit  absent \ninspection by the neutral inspection.  \n25.  If a resident desires to have the retrofits completed to the interior of his/her covered \ndwelling unit before the retrofits are scheduled to be performed by One Newtown, the resident \nmay request the retrofits in writing, and the requests will be granted by One Newtown on a first-\ncome, first-served basis.  One Newtown must complete the retrofits as promptly as practical, but \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 8 of 58\nno later than forty-five (45) days from the date on which the retrofits were requested by a resident \non a first-come, first-served basis.   \nVII.  NEUTRAL INSPECTOR  \n26.  One Newtown has or will enter into a contract with one or more neutral inspector(s) \nto conduct on-site inspections of the retrofits that  have been performed under this Order to \ndetermine whether the retrofits have been completed in accordance with the specifications in this \nOrder’s Appendices A and B.  Prior to entering into the contract with the inspector(s), One \nNewtown will submit the name(s) and resumes to the United States for approval.  The inspector(s) \nwill have expertise in the Accessible Design Requirements of the FHA, ADA, ADA Standards, \nANSI A117.1-1986 and the HUD-recognized safe harbors, will not be affiliated with One Newtown \nor its attorneys, and such expertise will be included in the submittal to the United States.   \n27.  An inspection of the Subject Property will take place within forty-five (45) days of \nthe completion of all of the retrofits to the Subject Property as set forth in the relevant Appendix, \nor as soon thereafter as practicable for each.  One Newtown will give the  United States at least \ntwenty-one (21) days prior written notice of any inspection, including any subsequent inspections \nas  set  forth  in  Paragraph  29,  and  will  give  the  United  States  an  opportunity  to  have  its \nrepresentatives present for the inspection. \n28.  The inspections will be conducted by the inspector in accordance with Appendix \nD, which will be provided to the inspector by One Newtown.   \n29.  The inspector will set out the results of each inspection in an Inspection Report, \nincluding deficits if any, in writing and will send that report to One Newtown and the United States.  \nThe inspector will take digital photographs of any deficiencies identified at the Subject Property \nand will include those photographs in the Inspection Report.  If the inspection indicates that not all \nthe  required retrofits have been made as specified in Appendices A and B, One Newtown will \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 9 of 58\ncorrect any applicable deficiencies within sixty (60) days and will pay for another inspection by \nthe same inspector to certify that such deficiencies have been corrected.  This process, including \nprior written notice to the United States of any inspections, will continue until the inspector certifies \nthat all the retrofits required under this Order have been made.  One Newtown will  pay all the \ninspector’s reasonable costs associated with these inspections of the Subject Property, and such \npayments will be made without regard to the inspector’s findings.  Upon reasonable notice to One \nNewtown, representatives of the United States will be permitted to inspect the retrofits made by \nOne Newtown in accordance with this Order, to ensure compliance; provided, however, that the \nUnited States will endeavor to minimize any inconvenience caused by such inspections. \nVIII.  TRANSFER OF INTEREST   \n30.  The sale, foreclosure, or any other transfer of ownership, in whole or in part, \nwhether voluntary or involuntary, of the Subject Property by its present owner will not affect One \nNewtown’s continuing obligation to retrofit the Subject Property as specified in this Order.    \nIX.

This account will be referred \nto as the “Settlement Fund.”  Within fifteen (15) days of the establishment of the Settlement Fund, \nOne Newtown will submit proof to the United States that the account has been established and the \nfunds deposited.     \n34.  Any interest accruing to the Settlement Fund will become a part of the Settlement \nFund and be used as set forth herein.

By consenting to entry of this Order, the Parties agree that in the event that One \nNewtown engages in any future conduct occurring after entry of this Order that leads to a \ndetermination of a violation of the FHA, such conduct will constitute a “subsequent violation” \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 3614(d)(1)(C)(ii).   \n55.  The Court will retain jurisdiction for the duration of this Order to enforce the terms \nof the Order; at the expiration of the Order, the case will be dismissed with prejudice.

The Property Survey will include all exterior and interior public and common use \nareas and as many units as required to determine the full extent of project \ncompliance with FHA and relevant ADA requirements, including: \n \na.  All portions of exterior and interior routes and circulation paths as \nrequired to determine existing conditions at all accessible route(s) and any \npotential alternate routes that may provide access to common areas or \nunits;    \n \nb.  All interior and exterior public and common use areas; and   \n \nc.  At least two of each unit type.  \n \n2.  Employee only areas (e.g., leasing workroom, staff-only package room, \ncommercial kitchen areas, and staff restroom) do not need to be surveyed. \n \n3.  If an accessibility survey of a Subject Property has been completed by an \napproved surveyor or inspector prior to the entry of this Order, those \nmeasurements may be reused and additional Property Surveys may be limited to \nsite evaluation of any portions of routes, common areas, or units that were not \nsurveyed or lack sufficient documentation of the survey results.   \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 49 of 58\nC.  Equipment  \n \n1.  The following equipment is required for all Property Surveys and Inspections \nconducted pursuant to this Order and Appendices: \n \na.  A standard 1” steel measuring tape; \n \nb.  A 24” nominal bar with a 6 1/2” digital inclinometer known as the \nSmartTool™ (“digital level”) or an equivalent instrument (other brands of \ndigital levels capable of measuring to a precision of 0.1% may be used \nincluding, for example, Bosch, Milwaukee, and Stabila).  Calibrate the \ndigital level according to the manufacturer’s instructions followed by \nperforming a 180-degree check reading prior to taking any measurements.  \nCheck calibration of the digital level at regular intervals during the survey \nand anytime the digital level is dropped or hit against another surface;    \n \nc.  A digital camera with minimum 16 megapixel resolution; and  \n \nd.  A standard door pressure gauge manufactured for this purpose. \n \n2.  The following equipment is optional for all Property Surveys and Inspections \nconducted pursuant to this Order and Appendices: \n \na.  Standard surveyor instruments; \n \nb.  A digital altimeter (Ziplevel or equivalent instrument) calibrated according \nto the manufacturer’s instructions; \n \nc.  Short digital inclinometer; or \n \nd.  Carpenter’s square or contour gauge. \n \nD.  Required Methodology and Documentation for Measurements of Length, Width, \nHeight, or Clearance \n \n1.  Measurements of length, width, height, or clearance: measure length, width, \nheight, or clearance using the measuring tape and record all findings with the \ncamera.  The camera must be held square to the element and aligned to reduce \nparallax.  Where possible, use the level to make sure that measurements are \naccurate and that the photograph is legible. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 50 of 58\nIllustration: \n \n2.  Measurements of slope: measurements of slope will be measured in percentages \nrecorded to the tenth of a percent.   \n \n3.  Measurements of length, width, height, or clearance: measurements of length, \nwidth, height, or clearance will be recorded in 1/8” increments.     \n \n4.  Width of door opening: open the door to a 90 degree open position, measure from \nface of door to the edge of the stop on the opposing jamb.   \n \nIllustration: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf unable to open the door to a full 90 degrees due to an obstruction, photograph \nand document the obstruction and measure and record the width of the door leaf. \n \n5.  Parking and access aisle dimensions: measure from the centerline of the stripe to \ncenterline of the stripe.  Alternatively, measure from one side of the stripe to the \nsame side of the stripe on the other side of the parking space. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 231   Filed 05/18/23   Page 51 of 58\n6.  Heights: measure heights of elements used by residents or members of the public \nto the top-most and bottom-most operating button, receptacle, etc., not to the \ncenterline of the device, with the exception of electrical receptacles.  For duplex \nelectrical receptacles, the measurement is to the centerline of the top outlet \n(maximum height) or centerline of the bottom outlet (minimum height).  Where \nelements are operated with a fob or motion sensor, the height measurement may \nbe anywhere within the design sensitivity range. \n \n7.  Closet depth: measure closet depth from front of closet drywall to back of closet \ndrywall on the inside of the closet. \n \n8.  Kitchen clearances: measure kitchen clearances from the edge of the counters to \nthe opposing counters, cabinets, appliances, or walls.  Do not include knobs at \nstoves, handles at refrigerators, and similar elements. \n \n9.  Slope: \n \na.

The  Accessible  Design  Requirements  in  the  FHA  for  covered  multifamily \ndwellings include the following:  \na.  the public use and common use portions of such dwellings must be readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with a disability;  \nb.  all the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within \nsuch dwellings must be sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons with \na disability using wheelchairs;  \nc.  all premises within such dwellings must contain the following features of \nadaptive design:  \n(i)  an accessible route into and through the dwelling; \n(ii)  light  switches,  electrical  outlets,  thermostats,  and  other \nenvironmental controls in accessible locations;  \n(iii)  reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation \nof grab bars; and  \n(iv)  usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using \na wheelchair can maneuver about the space.   \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).   \n16.  For the purposes of this Consent Order, the Views agrees that Cedar Views was \ndesigned and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, has an elevator, and therefore \nall the units at Cedar Views are “covered multifamily dwellings” within the meaning of the FHA, \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(A).  As such, those units and the public and common use areas, including \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 11 of 112\nthe  accessible  pedestrian  routes  at  Cedar  Views,  must  comply  with  the  Accessible  Design \nRequirements of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).   \nACCORDINGLY, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED: \nIV.  GENERAL INJUNCTION \n17.  The Views and its officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns, and all other \npersons in active concert or participation with it, are enjoined from discriminating on the basis of \ndisability as prohibited by the FHA.   \nV.  RETROFITS \n18.  The United States, as set forth herein and in its Second Amended Complaint, alleges \nthat Cedar Views does not meet the accessibility requirements of the FHA.  See ECF No. 41.  To \naddress the United States’ allegations, the Views will complete the actions and retrofits described \nin this Section.  \n19.  The Views acknowledges that if the United States’ allegations that Cedar Views \ndoes not comply with applicable FHA accessibility requirements are proven to be true: (a) the \nViews would be jointly and severally liable with Parry to correct non-compliant features designed \nby Parry and constructed by or for the Views; and (b) the Views would be liable to correct non-\ncompliant features constructed by or for the Views and not designed by Parry.  The Views does \nnot concede that the United States’ allegations are true and does not concede that other persons are \nnot potentially liable to correct the allegedly inaccessible features at Cedar Views. \n20.  As a compromise to resolve the United States’ allegations, the Views will complete \nthe retrofits set forth in the Retrofit Plan. \n21.  As soon as reasonably possible, but not later than twenty-four (24) months from the \nconclusion of the date of entry of this Order, the Views will complete the retrofits set forth in the \nRetrofit Plan.  The Views conducted a property inspection that the United States has considered \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 12 of 112\nand accepted, with modifications, in determining the retrofits set forth in the Retrofit Plan.  If \nadditional necessary retrofits are identified during inspections by the United States that are not \nreflected in the Retrofit Plan, those retrofits will be negotiated between the United States and the \nViews separately and completed pursuant to the requirements set forth in this Consent Order.  \n22.  If any architectural or engineering drawings are prepared as part of the retrofits set \nforth in the Retrofit Plan, the Views will provide those drawings to the United States for comment \nand approval within fourteen (14) days of their preparation.  The United States will provide \ncomments within sixty (60) days.  The Views will incorporate those comments into any relevant \narchitectural or engineering plans and resubmit those to the United States for approval.  This \nprocess will continue until the Views and United States reach mutual agreement on any retrofit \narchitectural or engineering plans.    \nVI.  NOTICE OF RETROFITS AND RESIDENT ACCOMMODATIONS \n23.  The Views will endeavor to minimize the inconvenience to Cedar Views residents \nin scheduling and performing the retrofits required by this Consent Order. \n24.  No later than thirty (30) days before commencing work in the Retrofit Plan at Cedar \nViews, the Views will provide to all residents at Cedar Views a notice that is substantially \nequivalent to Appendix B.  The notice will inform residents in covered dwelling units that (1) the \nUnited States alleges that the covered dwelling units and public and common use areas do not meet \nthe requirements of the FHA and that to resolve these allegations, the Views has agreed to perform \ncertain retrofits to the public and common use areas and the covered dwelling units; (2) the covered \ndwelling unit must be retrofitted within twenty-four (24) months; (3) the Views will provide the \nresident with a schedule of when the retrofits will be performed; (4) the retrofits will be performed \nat no cost to the resident; and (5) the Views will offer any resident of a unit scheduled to undergo \na retrofit who will be dislocated from the unit for more than twelve (12) hours consecutively a \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 13 of 112\nsimilarly-sized furnished unit at Cedar Views at no cost.  In the event that a similarly-sized \nfurnished unit at Cedar Views is not available, the Views will pay the resident the applicable \ngovernment  per  diem  rate  for  food  and  lodging  for  the  local  area  (as  available  at \nhttps://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates) for each day of undue inconvenience or \nhardship for the resident(s).  Such payment will be made prior to the commencement of any retrofit \nwork on the resident’s unit, so that the resident can use the payment to obtain alternative living \naccommodations and food while dislocated.  \n25.  In scheduling the agreed dwelling unit retrofits, the Views will reasonably prioritize \nthe retrofits to (i) any dwelling unit of a resident who requests to have the retrofits completed on a \npriority basis, (ii) any vacant dwelling unit, and (iii) any dwelling unit that is being turned over to \na new resident.   \nVII.  NEUTRAL INSPECTOR  \n26.  The Views has or will enter into a contract with one or more neutral inspector(s) to \nconduct on-site inspections of the retrofits performed pursuant to this Consent Order to determine \nwhether the retrofits have been completed in accordance with the Retrofit Plan.  Prior to entering \ninto the contract with the inspector(s), the Views will submit the name(s) and resumes to the United \nStates for approval.  The inspector(s)  will have expertise in the Accessible Design Requirements \nof the FHA, ADA, ADA Standards, ANSI A117.1-1986 and the HUD-recognized safe harbors, and \nsuch expertise will be included in the submittal to the United States.   \n27.  An inspection of Cedar Views will take place within forty-five (45) days of the \ncompletion of all of the retrofits set forth in the Retrofit Plan.  The Views will give the  United \nStates  at  least  twenty-one  (21)  days’  prior  written  notice  of  any  inspection,  including  any \nsubsequent inspection(s) as set forth in paragraph 29, and will give the United States an opportunity \nto have its representatives present for the inspection. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 14 of 112\n28.  The inspection(s) will be conducted by the  inspector in accordance with the \nprotocol attached as Appendix C to this Consent Order, which will be provided to the inspector \nby the Views.   \n29.  The inspector will set out the results of each inspection in a written inspection report \n(a “Property Inspection Report”), including deficits if any, in writing and will send that report \nto the Views and the United States.  The inspector will take digital photographs of any deficiencies \nidentified at the Cedar Views and will include those photographs in the Property Inspection Report.  \nIf the inspection indicates that not all the  required retrofits have been made as specified in the \nRetrofit Plan, the Views will correct any applicable deficiencies within sixty (60) days and will \npay for another inspection by the same inspector to certify such deficiencies have been corrected.  \nThis process, including prior written notice to the United States of any inspections, will continue \nuntil the inspector certifies that all the retrofits set forth in the Retrofit Plan have been made.  The \nViews will  pay all the inspector’s reasonable costs associated with these inspections of Cedar \nViews, and such payments will be made without regard to the inspector’s findings.  Upon \nreasonable notice to the Views, representatives of the United States will be permitted to inspect the \nretrofits made by the Views pursuant to this Consent Order to ensure compliance; provided, \nhowever, that the  United States will endeavor to minimize any inconvenience caused by such \ninspections. \nVIII.  ACCESS TO CEDAR VIEWS \n30.  The Views agrees to allow access to the public and common use areas and covered \nmultifamily dwelling unit interiors at Cedar Views for the purpose of performing the retrofits and \ninspection(s) required under this Consent Order, and for the purpose of interviewing or meeting \nwith residents at Cedar Views to aid in the implementation or completion of this Consent Order. \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 15 of 112\nIX.  TRANSFER OF INTEREST   \n31.  The sale, foreclosure, or any other transfer of ownership, in whole or in part, \nwhether voluntary or involuntary, of Cedar Views will not affect the View’s continuing obligation \nto retrofit Cedar Views as set forth in the Retrofit Plan.  Should the Views sell or transfer ownership \nof Cedar Views, in whole or in part, or any portion thereof, prior to the completion of the retrofits \nset forth in the Retrofit Plan, the Views will, at least thirty (30) days prior to completion of the sale \nor transfer: (a) provide to each prospective buyer written notice that Cedar Views is subject to this \nConsent Order, including specifically the Views’ obligations to complete required retrofit work \nand to allow inspections, along with a copy of this Consent Order; and (b) provide to the United \nStates, by e-mail and first-class mail, written notice of the intent to sell or transfer ownership, along \nwith a copy of the notice sent to each buyer or transferee, and each buyer’s or transferee’s name, \naddress and telephone number. \nX.  NO RAISING OF RENT PRICES OR FEES \n32.  The Views may not raise the rent price of any dwelling unit or demand any deposit \nor other fee for a dwelling unit at Cedar Views solely because of contemplated or completed \nretrofits in a dwelling unit or common area pursuant to this Consent Order.   \nXI.  NON-DISCRIMINATION IN FUTURE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION  \n33.  The Views will maintain and provide to the United States the following information \nand statements regarding any covered multifamily dwellings currently under construction or \nintended to be, or which actually are, purchased, developed, built, designed, constructed, or \nengineered in whole or in part, by any of them or by any entities in which they have a position of \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 16 of 112\ncontrol as an officer, director, member, or manager, or have a ten-percent (10%) or larger \nownership share:1 \na.  the name and address of the property;  \nb.  a description of the property and the individual units;  \nc.  the name, address, and telephone number of the civil engineer(s) involved \nwith the project;  \nd.  a  statement  from  the  civil  engineer(s)  involved  with  the  property \nacknowledging and describing his/her knowledge of and training in the \nAccessible  Design  Requirements  of  the  FHA,  the  ADA,  the  ADA \nStandards, ANSI A117.1-1986 and the field of accessible site design and \ncertifying that he/she has reviewed the engineering documents for the \nproject and that the design specifications therein fully comply with the \nrequirements of the FHA, the ADA, the ADA Standards, and ANSI A117.1-\n1986 or a HUD-recognized safe harbor used in its entirety;  \ne.  the name, address and telephone number of the architect(s) involved with \nthe property;  \nf.  a statement from all architect(s) involved with the property acknowledging \nand describing his/her knowledge of and training in the Accessible Design \nRequirements  of  the  FHA,  the  ADA,  the  ADA  Standards,  and  ANSI \nA117.1-1986 and certifying that he/she has reviewed the architectural plans \nfor the property and that the design specifications therein fully comply with \nthe requirements of the FHA, the ADA, the ADA Standards, and ANSI \nA117.1-1986 or a HUD-recognized safe harbor used in its entirety; and  \ng.  if the engineering documents or architectural plans are revised, and the \nrevisions could have any impact on the accessibility of the dwellings or \nproperty, Defendant will obtain, maintain, and provide to the United States \nupon request, a statement from the civil engineer(s) or architect(s) involved \nwith  the  property  that  all  specifications  in  the  revised  engineering \ndocuments or architectural plans, as pertinent, comply with the Accessible \nDesign  Requirements  of  the  Fair  Housing  Act,  the  ADA,  the  ADA \nStandards, and ANSI A117.1-1986 or a HUD-recognized safe harbor used \nin its entirety. \n \n1   Such information and statements need not be maintained on properties for which the Views \nbids or expresses an interest, but does not become finally involved. \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 17 of 112\n34.  The  Views  will  provide  to  the  United  States  a  copy  of  any  architectural  or \nengineering plans and related construction documents for any newly designed or constructed \nproperty identified pursuant to paragraph 33 upon request.   \nXII.

In no event will the aggregate of all such checks exceed the sum of the Settlement \nFund (including accrued interest). \n47.  When the United States has received the check from the Views payable to an \nAggrieved Person and a signed release in the form of Appendix E (a “Release”) from the \nAggrieved Person, the United States will deliver the check to the Aggrieved Person and the \noriginal, signed Release to the Views.  No Aggrieved Person will be paid until the Aggrieved \nPerson has executed and delivered to the United States the Release. \n48.  If any money remains in the Settlement Fund after all Aggrieved Persons identified \nby the United States have been compensated, the remainder will be paid to the United States \nTreasury in the form of an electronic funds transfer in accordance with written instructions to be \nprovided by the United States.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 228   Filed 05/10/23   Page 20 of 112\nXIII.

INTRODUCTION \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  This Consent Order is entered into between Plaintiff United States and Rule 19 \nDefendant, Care HSL Newtown Propco LP (“Care HSL Newtown”). \n2.  The United States initiated this action on December 11, 2020, to enforce the \nprovisions  of  the  Fair  Housing  Act  (“FHA”),  42  U.S.C.  §§  3601-3619  and  the  FHA’s \nimplementing regulations, 24 C.F.R. §§ 100.200-100.205, as set forth in more detail in the Second \nAmended Complaint filed on April 23, 2021 (ECF 41), and as summarized below (the “Action”).  \nSpecifically, the United States’ Complaint alleges that J. Randolph Parry Architects, P.C. and the \nowners  of  certain  covered  multifamily  properties  (collectively  “the  Design  and  Construct \nDefendants”) have designed and constructed various multifamily properties, including, but not \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 207   Filed 11/28/22   Page 3 of 11\nlimited to, the Birches at Newtown (the “Birches at Newtown”), without required accessible \nfeatures, and that this conduct constitutes a pattern or practice of discrimination and a denial of \nrights to a group of persons because of disability, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(f)(1), (f)(2), \n(f)(3)(C), and 3614(a). \n3.  The  United  States’  Complaint  further  alleges  that  the  Design  and  Construct \nDefendants have, among other things, failed to design and construct the Birches at Newtown with \nthe features of accessible and adaptable design and construction required by Title III of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12213, and its implementing \nregulation, the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, 28 C.F.R. § 36.104; 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36 \nAppendix A (1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design), as amended at 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36 \nAppendix D (2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design) (hereinafter, the “ADA Standards”). \nB.  Care HSL Newtown and Birches at Newtown \n4.  Care HSL Newtown is the owner of the Birches at Newtown.  The Birches at \nNewtown is a personal care and memory care community located at 70 Durham Road, Newtown, \nPA 18940.    \n5.  Care HSL Newtown had no involvement in the design or construction of the \nBirches at Newtown.  Sometime after its design and construction, the Birches at Newtown was \nsold to Care HSL Newtown, which currently owns the Birches at Newtown.  \n6.  Care HSL Newtown is named in the United States’ Complaint as a necessary party \nto this lawsuit in whose absence complete relief cannot be afforded to the United States.  See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 19. \n7.  The parties acknowledge that this Consent Order does not constitute, and should \nnot be construed as, an admission of wrongdoing by Care HSL Newtown, as identified herein and \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 207   Filed 11/28/22   Page 4 of 11\nCare HSL Newtown explicitly denies any wrongdoing on its part. \nC.  Relevant Requirements of the Fair Housing Act \n8.  The  FHA  provides  that,  for  elevator  residential  buildings  with  four  or  more \ndwelling units, all units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, \nare “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible and \nadaptive design to make such units accessible to, or adaptable for use by, a person who has or \ndevelops a disability.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(A). \n9.  The FHA further provides that, for non-elevator buildings with four or more \ndwelling units, all ground floor units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after \nMarch 13, 1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of \naccessible and adaptive design to make such units accessible to, or adaptable for use by, a person \nwho has or develops a disability.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(B). \n10.  The accessible and adaptive design provisions of the FHA require that for covered \nmultifamily dwellings: (i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (ii) all the doors designed to allow passage \ninto and within all premises within such dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by \npersons with a disability using wheelchairs; and (iii) all premises within such dwellings contain \nthe following features of adaptive design: (I) an accessible route into and through the dwelling; \n(II) light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible \nlocations; (III) reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and (IV) \nusable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about the \nspace.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C). \n11.  The Birches at Newtown is an elevator building and was first occupied after March \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 207   Filed 11/28/22   Page 5 of 11\n13, 1991, and therefore all units are “covered multifamily dwellings” within the meaning of the \nFHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(A).   \nD.  Relevant Requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n12.  The ADA and the ADA Standards, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A, which have been issued \nby the U.S. Department of Justice to implement the design and construction requirements of Title \nIII of the ADA, require that all “public accommodations” designed and constructed for first \noccupancy after January 26, 1993, and the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \naccommodations of those public accommodations, be readily accessible to and usable by persons \nwith disabilities in accordance with certain accessibility standards promulgated under that Act.  42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12182(a) and 12183(a)(1).  A rental or sales office for an apartment, condominium, or \npatio home complex is a “public accommodation” under the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). \n13.  The leasing office at the Birches at Newtown was designed and constructed for first \noccupancy after January 26, 1993.  Therefore, the leasing office and the facilities and privileges \nprovided at that office, such as public parking, are required to be designed and constructed in \naccordance with the standards promulgated under the ADA. \nE.  Care HSL Newtown’s Consent to Entry of this Order \n14.  Care HSL Newtown agrees that the units as described above and the public and \ncommon use areas of the Birches at Newtown are subject to the requirements of the FHA, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 3601-3619. \n15.  Care HSL Newtown agrees that the leasing office at the Birches at Newtown and \nthe facilities and privileges provided at that leasing office, such as public parking, are subject to \nthe requirements of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181, et seq., and its implementing regulation, the \nADA Standards. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 207   Filed 11/28/22   Page 6 of 11\n16.  Care HSL Newtown agrees that this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter \nof this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and 12188(b)(1)(B).   \n17.  As indicated by the signatures appearing below, the United States and Care HSL \nNewtown agree to the entry of this Consent Order.  This Consent Order is final and binding.  It \nsets forth all of the obligations incumbent on, and all of the relief sought from Care HSL Newtown \nand its successors and assigns arising out of or resulting from the claims the United States has or \nmay have brought against them for alleged violations of the ADA, the ADA Standards and/or the \nFHA. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND AGREED as follows: \nII.      GENERAL INJUNCTION \n18.  Subject to the terms set forth herein, Care HSL Newtown and each of its officers, \nemployees, agents, successors, and assigns, and all other persons in active concert or participation \nwith them, shall refrain from knowingly and/or willfully engaging in conduct that denies the \nUnited States or other persons or parties designated by the United States or the Court reasonable \naccess to the public and common use areas, the covered multifamily dwellings, or the public \naccommodations areas at the Birches at Newtown, and from knowingly and/or willfully engaging \nin any other action to impede any retrofits required to bring the Birches at Newtown into \ncompliance with the FHA, the ADA, and the ADA Standards. \nIII.

Upon reasonable notice, and in accordance with Care HSL Newtown ’s standard \nrules,  regulations,  policies,  and  procedures  for  third-party  access  and  health  and  safety \nrequirements and procedures and in accordance with the facility’s license, Care HSL Newtown \nshall allow the United States and its expert access to the units (including unit interiors) at the Care \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 207   Filed 11/28/22   Page 7 of 11\nHSL Newtown for inspection, including but not limited to photographing by the United States’ \nexpert(s), including providing required notice to tenants.

In accordance with Care HSL Newtown’s standard rules and regulations for third-\nparty access and health and safety requirements and procedures in accordance with the facility’s \nlicense, Care HSL Newtown shall allow the United States and its expert access to the public and \ncommon use areas at the Birches at Newtown, to be determined by the United States in its sole \ndiscretion, including but not limited to photographing by the United States’ expert(s).

Care HSL Newtown agrees to meet-and-confer in good faith with the Parties in the event \nthat such settlement, consent order or Court order regarding the Birches at Newtown includes terms \nthat are beyond the scope of this Consent Order.   \n26.  Subject to the terms of this Paragraph, Care HSL Newtown hereby waives all rights \nto object to any retrofits of the Birches at Newtown that may be agreed to by the United States and \nthe Design and Construct Defendants in connection with any settlement or consent order, and/or \nordered by the Court in this case.

Care HSL Newtown’s input will be limited to proposals intended to ensure that all \nretrofits are performed in a good and workmanlike manner, the aesthetic aspects of any retrofits, \nthe labor and materials to be utilized related to any retrofits, and that all retrofits will not \nunreasonably interfere with Care HSL Newtown’s business, operations, or compliance with \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 207   Filed 11/28/22   Page 9 of 11\nstatutory, regulatory, or licensure requirements. \n27.  Upon reasonable notice, and in accordance with Care HSL Newtown’s standard \nrules,  regulations,  policies,  and  procedures  for  third-party  access  and  health  and  safety \nrequirements and procedures and in accordance with the facility’s license, Care HSL Newtown \nshall allow any of the Design and Construct Defendants or other persons or entities (other than the \nother Rule 19 Defendants), as the Court may order, to make retrofits at the Birches at Newtown.  \nUpon reasonable notice, and in accordance with Care HSL Newtown’s standard rules, regulations, \npolicies, and procedures for third-party access and health and safety requirements and procedures \nand in accordance with the facility’s license, Care HSL Newtown shall allow access to the Birches \nat Newtown by the United States or other persons or parties designated by the United States or the \nCourt for purposes of planning, photographing, evaluating, and performing any action required \nunder a  consent order or other order by the Court to bring the Birches at Newtown into compliance \nwith the FHA, the ADA, and the ADA Standards.   \n28.

Pt. 36 \nAppendix A (1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design), as amended at 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36 \nAppendix D (2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design) (hereinafter, the “ADA Standards”). \nB.  Care HSL Harleysville and Birches at Harleysville \n4.  Care HSL Harleysville is the owner of the Birches at Harleysville.  The Birches at \nHarleysville  is  a  personal  care  and  memory  care  community  located  at  691  Main  Street, \nHarleysville, PA 19438.    \n5.  Care HSL Harleysville had no involvement in the design or construction of the \nBirches at Harleysville.  Sometime after its design and construction, the Birches at Harleysville \nwas sold to Care HSL Harleysville, which currently owns the Birches at Harleysville.  \n6.  Care HSL Harleysville is named in the United States’ Complaint as a necessary \nparty to this lawsuit in whose absence complete relief cannot be afforded to the United States.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 19. \n7.  The parties acknowledge that this Consent Order does not constitute, and should \nnot be construed as, an admission of wrongdoing by Care HSL Harleysville, as identified herein \n  2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 210   Filed 11/28/22   Page 3 of 10\nand Care HSL Harleysville explicitly denies any wrongdoing on its part. \nC.  Relevant Requirements of the Fair Housing Act \n8.  The  FHA  provides  that,  for  elevator  residential  buildings  with  four  or  more \ndwelling units, all units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, \nare “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible and \nadaptive design to make such units accessible to, or adaptable for use by, a person who has or \ndevelops a disability.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(A). \n9.  The FHA further provides that, for non-elevator buildings with four or more \ndwelling units, all ground floor units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after \nMarch 13, 1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of \naccessible and adaptive design to make such units accessible to, or adaptable for use by, a person \nwho has or develops a disability.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(B). \n10.  The accessible and adaptive design provisions of the FHA require that for covered \nmultifamily dwellings: (i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (ii) all the doors designed to allow passage \ninto and within all premises within such dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by \npersons with a disability using wheelchairs; and (iii) all premises within such dwellings contain \nthe following features of adaptive design: (I) an accessible route into and through the dwelling; \n(II) light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible \nlocations; (III) reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and (IV) \nusable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about the \nspace.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C). \n11.  The Birches at Harleysville is an elevator building and was first occupied after \n  3 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 210   Filed 11/28/22   Page 4 of 10\nMarch 13, 1991, and therefore all units are “covered multifamily dwellings” within the meaning \nof the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(A).   \nD.  Relevant Requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n12.  The ADA and the ADA Standards, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A, which have been issued \nby the U.S. Department of Justice to implement the design and construction requirements of Title \nIII of the ADA, require that all “public accommodations” designed and constructed for first \noccupancy after January 26, 1993, and the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \naccommodations of those public accommodations, be readily accessible to and usable by persons \nwith disabilities in accordance with certain accessibility standards promulgated under that Act.  42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12182(a) and 12183(a)(1).  A rental or sales office for an apartment, condominium, or \npatio home complex is a “public accommodation” under the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). \n13.  The leasing office at the Birches at Harleysville was designed and constructed for \nfirst occupancy after January 26, 1993.  Therefore, the leasing office and the facilities and \nprivileges provided at that office, such as public parking, are required to be designed and \nconstructed in accordance with the standards promulgated under the ADA. \nE.  Care HSL Harleysville’s Consent to Entry of this Order \n14.  Care HSL Harleysville agrees that the units as described above and the public and \ncommon use areas of the Birches at Harleysville are subject to the requirements of the FHA, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 3601-3619. \n15.  Care HSL Harleysville agrees that the leasing office at the Birches at Harleysville \nand the facilities and privileges provided at that leasing office, such as public parking, are subject \nto the requirements of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181, et seq., and its implementing regulation, the \nADA Standards. \n  4 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 210   Filed 11/28/22   Page 5 of 10\n16.  Care HSL Harleysville agrees that this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter \nof this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and 12188(b)(1)(B).   \n17.

It \nsets forth all of the obligations incumbent on, and all of the relief sought from Care HSL \nHarleysville and its successors and assigns arising out of or resulting from the claims the United \nStates has or may have brought against them for alleged violations of the ADA, the ADA Standards \nand/or the FHA. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND AGREED as follows: \nII.

AND J. RANDOLPH PARRY ARCHITECTS, P.C.  \n \nI.   INTRODUCTION  \n1.   This action is brought by the United States to enforce provisions of the  Fair Housing \nAct (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§  3601-3619, and the  Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42  \nU.S.C. §§ 12181-12189.  Specifically, the United States’  Second Amended Complaint alleges that  \nDefendants have engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against persons with disabilities  \nand denied rights to a group of persons because  of disability by failing to design and construct  \ncovered multifamily dwellings with the features of accessible and adaptive design and construction \nrequired by the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3), and as required by the ADA, 42  \nU.S.C. § 12183(a)(1).  See  ECF  No. 41.  These covered multifamily dwelling units include  \nproperties for seniors, including independent living, assisted living, and memory support dwelling \nunits.   \n2.   The United States and  Defendant  Westrum Hanover, L.P., a Delaware  limited  \npartnership  (“Westrum” or   “Defendant”), have entered  into this  Consent Order   (hereinafter  \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 2 of 15 \n“Order”)  (collectively “Parties”)  and agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter  \nof this case under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and 12188(b)(1)(B).  \nThe Parties further agree  that this controversy should be resolved without further proceedings and  \nwithout an evidentiary hearing or a trial.   \n3.   The United States  and Defendant J. Randolph Parry Architects, P.C. (“Parry”)  \npreviously entered into a consent  order in this case  that the Court approved on September 28, 2022  \n(“September 2022 Order”).   See  ECF No. 200.   Parry is only a party to this Order for administrative  \npurposes, specifically to memorialize the receipt of funds from Westrum and the administration of  \nsuch funds as further set forth herein, and this Order in no way modifies, alters, amends, \nsupplements, or revises the September 2022 Order. To the extent there is any conflict or ambiguity  \nbetween this Order and the September 2022 Order, the September 2022 Order shall control.  \n4.   Specifically, as to  Westrum, the United States alleges that  Westrum  engaged in a  \npattern or practice of discrimination and a denial of rights based on disability when it failed to  \ndesign and construct  Traditions of Hanover  with  the accessibility features required by the FHA  \nand ADA.  The United States’  Second Amended Complaint alleges that accessibility violations at  \nthe Traditions of Hanover  include, but are not limited to, barriers  at accessible routes, common-\nuse laundry rooms, activity rooms, and amenities, and insufficient clear floor space in unit  \nbathrooms  and kitchens.   \n5.   Westrum  denies that it engaged in intentional or willful discrimination  against  \npersons with disabilities  and states  that at all times  it has  attempted to comply with all applicable  \nfederal laws, including those requiring accessibility  such as the FHA and ADA,  in the design and \nconstruction  of Traditions of Hanover.   \n2  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 3 of 15 \n6.   Westrum  represents  that it is no longer an active  entity,  although it has not  been  \nwound-up in accordance with  the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, 6 Del. Code  \n§ 17-1102, et seq..   Westrum  further represents  that it has no intention of becoming an active  entity \nin any jurisdiction or designing or constructing multifamily properties in the future.  \n7.   The Parties agree that this  Order is being entered into by Westrum  as a compromise  \nof disputed claims, and should not be deemed an admission of liability by Westrum.  \n8.   As indicated by the signatures appearing below, the Parties agree to the entry of  \nthis Order.  \nII.   DEFINITIONS  \n9.   “Subject Property” means  Traditions of Hanover, an independent living community  \nlocated at  5300 Northgate Drive, Bethlehem,  PA 18017.  \n10.   “Defendant” means  Westrum Hanover, L.P.  (“Westrum”).  \n11.   “Accessible Design Requirements” means  the requirements that are listed in the  \naccessible and adaptive design provisions of the FHA and stated in Paragraph  17.  \n12.   “Westrum Participants”  means Westrum, or  any principal, manager, officer, or  \nowner with an ownership interest of 10% or greater in Westrum.  \nIII.

The FHA provides that, for residential buildings with an elevator consisting of four  \nor more dwelling units, all units that are designed and constructed for first  occupancy after March  \n13, 1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible  \nand adaptive design to make such units accessible to or adaptable for  use by persons  with  \ndisabilities.  42 U.S.C. §  3604(f)(3)(C) and  (f)(7)(A).  \n17.   The FHA provides that, for non-elevator residential buildings with four or more  \ndwelling units, all ground-floor units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after  \nMarch 13,  1991, are  “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of  \naccessible and adaptive design to make such units accessible to or adaptable for use by persons  \nwith  disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(B).  \n18.   The  Accessible  Design  Requirements  in  the  FHA   for  covered  multifamily  \ndwellings  include: (i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings  must be  readily \naccessible to and usable  by persons with a disability; (ii) all the doors designed to allow passage  \ninto and within all premises within such dwellings  must be  sufficiently wide to allow passage by  \npersons with  a disability  using wheelchairs; (iii)  all premises within such dwellings  must contain  \nthe following features of adaptive design: (I) an accessible route into and through the dwelling;  \n(II) light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats,  and other environmental controls in accessible  \nlocations; (III) reinforcements in bathroom walls  to allow later installation of grab bars; and (IV)  \nusable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about the  \nspace.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).   \n4  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 5 of 15 \n19.   Westrum  agrees  that the  Subject  Property was designed  and constructed  for first  \noccupancy after March 13, 1991, and therefore all the units in buildings  with elevators and the  \nground-floor units in non-elevator buildings at the  Subject  Property are  “covered multifamily  \ndwellings” within the meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(A) and (B).  As such, those  \nunits and the public and common use areas,  including the accessible pedestrian routes  at the  \nSubject   Property,   must  comply  with  the  Accessible  Design  Requirements  of  42  U.S.C.                           \n§ 3604(f)(3)(C).    \nC.   Relevant Requirements of the ADA  \n20.   The ADA and the ADA Standards  for  Accessible Design, ADA  Accessibility  \nGuidelines  for Buildings and  Facilities,  28 C.F.R.  pt.  36,  app.  A  (“ADA  Standards”),  issued  by  the  \nU.S.   Department   of   Justice   (the  “Department”)   to   implement   the   design  and  construction  \nrequirements  of  Title  III  of  the  ADA,  require that all “public  accommodations”  designed   and  \nconstructed   for   first   occupancy   after   January  26,   1993,   and   the   goods,   services,  facilities,  \nprivileges,  advantages,  or  accommodations  of those  public accommodations, be  readily  accessible  \nto  and  usable  by  persons  with  disabilities  in  accordance  with  certain  accessibility   standards  \npromulgated  under  that Act.  42 U.S.C.  §§ 12182(a) and 12183(a)(1).  A rental or sales  office for  \nan  apartment,  condominium,  or patio  home  complex  is a  “public  accommodation”  under  the  ADA.   \n42  U.S.C.  §  12181(7)(E).    \n21.   Westrum  agrees  that  the  rental  offices  at the Subject Property  were designed and  \nconstructed for  first occupancy after January 26, 1993, and   therefore  the  rental  offices  and  the  \nfacilities  and  privileges  provided at  those  offices,  such as public parking,  are required to be  \ndesigned  and  constructed in  accordance with  the  standards  promulgated  under the  ADA.  \nACCORDINGLY, it is  hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED:  \n5  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 6 of 15 \nIV.   GENERAL INJUNCTION  \n22.   Westrum  and its officers, employees, agents, successors,  and assigns, and all other  \npersons in active concert or participation with them,  are enjoined from discriminating on the basis  \nof disability as prohibited by the  FHA and  the  ADA.   \nV.   SETTLEMENT FUND AND PAYMENTS TO  AGGRIEVED PERSONS  \n23.   Within  thirty (30) days  from the entry  of this Order,  Westrum, by and through its  \ninsurance company,  will  deposit in an interest-bearing escrow  account  the sum of  FIFTEEN  \nTHOUSAND DOLLARS ($15,000)  into the interest-bearing  escrow  account (the “Settlement  \nFund”) established by Parry  under  paragraph 36 of the  September 2022 Order between Plaintiff  \nUnited States and Parry, see ECF NO. 200, for the purpose of compensating any aggrieved persons  \nwhom the United States  determines were harmed by Westrum’s alleged discriminatory housing  \npractices (hereinafter  “aggrieved persons”).   To  facilitate this transfer of  funds, within fourteen  \n(14) days of  the date of  entry of this  consent order, counsel for  Parry  shall provide all necessary  \naccount and wire transfer information to counsel for Westrum.  \n24.   Westrum shall submit proof to the United States, in writing,  that the money has  \nbeen deposited into the Settlement Fund within forty-eight (48) hours  after  the deposit is made.  \n25.   Immediately after the $15,000 deposit is made to the Settlement Fund by \nWestrum, Parry may withdraw  ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ($1,500)  as compensation \nfor the administration and distribution of the Settlement Fund as described below in Paragraphs  \n25-30.  \n26.   Any interest accruing to the Settlement Fund will  become a part of the Settlement  \nFund and be used as set forth herein.  Parry  will  be solely responsible for  any taxes assessed or  \nowed on any  interest earned on money deposited pursuant to Paragraph 23, above.   \n6  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 7 of 15 \n27.   Potential  aggrieved persons have  twenty-four  (24) months from the entry of this  \nOrder to contact the United States.  The United States  will  investigate the claims of allegedly  \naggrieved persons and inform  Parry  as to its determination as to which persons are aggrieved and  \nan appropriate amount of damages (plus accrued  interest) that should be paid to each aggrieved \nperson.  Westrum  agree  that  the determinations of the United States  will  be final, and Westrum  \nhereby waives  the  right to contest the United States’ determination in this or any other proceeding.    \n28.   The United States  will  submit its final recommendations to the Court for approval  \nin  the form of a Stipulated Order.  Within twenty (20) days  from  the entry of a Court order  \nproviding for the distribution of funds, Parry  will  deliver to the United States, by overnight  \ndelivery, a separate check payable to  each  aggrieved person in the amounts  stated in the Stipulated  \nOrder.    \n29.   In  no event  will  the aggregate of all such checks  exceed the sum of the Settlement  \nFund,  plus accrued interest.  \n30.   When the United States  has received a check from  Parry  payable to  an aggrieved  \nperson and a signed release  in the form of Appendix A  from the aggrieved person, the United \nStates  will  deliver the check to the aggrieved person and the original, signed release to Westrum.  \nNo aggrieved person  will  be paid until he or she has executed and delivered  to the United States  \nthe release at Appendix  A.  \n31.   If any money remains in the Settlement Fund after all aggrieved persons identified \nby the United States have been compensated, the remainder will be paid to  the United States  \nTreasury in the form of  an electronic funds transfer in accordance  with written instructions to be  \nprovided by the United States.   \n7  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 8 of 15 \nVI.

Westrum has represented that it is currently a defunct entity and  is  no longer  \nengaged in the design and/or  construction of covered multifamily dwellings.  In the  event  \nWestrum  intends to engage in any future design and/or  construction of covered multifamily  \ndwellings  during the term of this Consent Order, it will report that intention to the United States  \nwithin seven (7) days.   \n33.   Within thirty (30) days  of notification  to the United States, Westrum will ensure  \nthat its principals,  employees,  and agents who have authority over the design and/or construction \nof covered multifamily dwellings have a  copy of, are familiar with, and personally review the  Fair  \nHousing Accessibility Guidelines, 56 Fed. Reg. 9472 (1991), and the United States Department of  \nHousing and Urban Development, Fair Housing Act Design Manual, A Manual to Assist Builders  \nin Meeting the Accessibility Requirements of the Fair Housing Act, (August 1996, Rev.

Westrum Participants and all employees and agents whose duties, in whole or  in part,  \ninvolve the management, sale, and/or rental of multifamily dwellings at issue in this case will be  \ninformed of those portions of the Fair Housing Act that relate to accessibility requirements,  \nreasonable accommodations, and reasonable modifications.  \n34.   Within sixty (60)  days  of notification  to the United States,  Westrum and  all its  \nprincipals, employees or agents whose duties, in whole or in part, involve the design and/or  \nconstruction of covered multifamily dwellings  will undergo training on the  design and construction  \nrequirements of the FHA and the ADA.  The training will be conducted by  a qualified individual, \nunconnected to Westrum  or its attorneys, who has  been approved in advance by the United States.   \nAny expenses associated with this training will be borne by Westrum.  Westrum will provide to \nthe United States, within thirty (30) days  after the training, the name(s), address(es) and telephone  \nnumber(s) of the trainer(s); copies of the training outlines, and any materials distributed by the  \n8  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 9 of 15 \ntrainers; and certifications executed by all persons to which this  paragraph applies confirming their  \nattendance, in a form substantially equivalent to Appendix B.  \nVII.   NOTIFICATION AND DOCUMENT RETENTION REQUIREMENTS  \n35.   During the term of this  Order, Westrum  will advise the United States in writing  \nwithin fifteen (15) days  of receipt of any written administrative or legal fair housing complaint \nagainst any property owned,  managed, designed, or constructed by them, or against any employees  \nor agents of  Westrum  working at or for any such property, regarding discrimination on the basis \nof disability in housing.   Upon reasonable notice, Westrum  will also provide the United States all  \ninformation it may request concerning any such complaint.  Westrum  will also advise the United  \nStates, in writing, within fifteen (15) days of the  resolution of any complaint.  \n36.   During the term of this Order, Westrum  is required to preserve all records related  \nto this Order, to the  Subject  Property,  and to any other covered multifamily dwellings designed, \nconstructed, owned, operated, or acquired by them during the  term of  this Order.

By consenting to entry of  this Order, the  Parties agree that in the event that  Westrum  \nengages in any future conduct occurring after  entry of this Order that leads to a determination of a  \n9  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-1  Filed 11/02/23  Page 10 of 15 \nviolation of the FHA, such conduct will constitute a \"subsequent violation\" under 42  U.S.C. \n§ 3614(d)(l)(C)(ii). \n39.  The Comi will retain jurisdiction for the duration ofthis Order to enforce the terms \nof the Order; at the expiration of the Order, the case will be dismissed with prejudice.

AND J. RANDOLPH PARRY ARCHITECTS, \nP.C. \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  This action is brought by the United States to enforce provisions ofthe Fair Housing \nAct (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1218 1-12189.  Specifically, the United States' Second Amended Complaint alleges that \nDefendants have engaged in a pattern or practice ofdiscrimination against persons with disabilities \nand denied rights to a group of persons because of disability by failing to design and construct \ncovered multifamily dwellings with the features ofaccessible and adaptive design and construction \nrequired by the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(l), (f)(2), and (f)(3), and as required by the ADA, 42 \nU.S.C.  § 12183(a)(1).

The United States and Defendant One Boyertown Properties, L.P., a Pennsylvania \nlimited partnership (\"One Boyertown\" or \"Defendant\"), have entered into this Consent Order \n(hereinafter \"Order\") ( collectively \"Parties\") and agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the \nsubject matter of this case under 28 U.S.C. §§  1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and \n12188(6) (I )(B). The Parties further agree that this controversy should be resolved without further \nproceedings and without an evidentiary hearing or a trial. \n3.  The United States and Defendant J.  Randolph Parry Architects, P.C. (\"Parry\") \npreviously entered into a consent order in this case that the Court approved on September 28, 2022 \n(\"September 2022 Order\"). See ECF No. 200. Parry is only a party to this Order for administrative \npurposes,  specifically  to  memorialize  the  receipt  of funds  from  One  Boyertown  and  the \nadministration of such funds as further set forth herein, and this Order in no way modifies, alters, \namends, supplements, or revises the September 2022 Order. To the extent there is any conflict or \nambiguity between this Order and the September 2022 Order, the September 2022 Order shall \ncontrol. \n4.  Specifically, as to One Boyertown, the United States alleges that One Boyertown \nengaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination and a denial ofrights based on disability when \nit failed to design and construct Chestnut Knoll with the accessibility features required by the FHA \nand ADA.  The United States' Second Amended Complaint alleges that accessibility violations at \nthe Chestnut Knoll  include, but are not limited to, barriers at accessible routes, common-use \nlaundry rooms, activity rooms, and amenities, and insufficient clear floor space in unit bathrooms \nand kitchens. \n5.  One Boyertown denies that it engaged in intentional or willful discrimination \nagainst persons with disabilities and states that at all times it has attempted to comply with all \n2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-2  Filed 11/02/23  Page 3 of 15 \napplicable federal laws, including those requiring accessibility such as the FHA and ADA, in the \ndesign and construction of Chestnut Knoll. \n6.  One Boyertown represents that it is no longer an active entity, although it has not \nbeen wound-up in accordance with the Pennsylvania Limited Partnership Act, 15 Pa.C.S. § 8611, \nel seq.  One Boyertown further represents that it has no intention of becoming an active entity in \nany jurisdiction or designing or constructing multifamily properties in the future. \n7.  The Parties agree that this Order is being entered into by One Boyertown as a \ncompromise of disputed claims, and should not be deemed an admission of liability by  One \nBoyertown. \n8.  As indicated by the signatures appearing below, the Parties agree to the entry of \nthis Order. \nII.

One Boyertown agrees that the Subject Property was designed and constructed for \nfirst occupancy after March 13, 1991, and therefore all the units in buildings with elevators and \nthe ground-floor units in non-elevator buildings at the Subject Property are \"covered multifamily \ndwellings\" within the meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(A) and (B).  As such, those \nunits and the public and common use areas, including the accessible pedestrian routes at the \nSubject Property,  must  comply  with  the  Accessible  Design  Requirements  of 42  U.S.C.  § \n3604(f)(3)(C). \nC.  Relevant Requirements of the ADA \n20.

A rental or sales office for \nan apartment, condominium, or patio home complex is a \"public accommodation\"  under the ADA. \n42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). \n21.  One Boyertown agrees that the rental offices at the Subject Property were designed \nand constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, and therefore the rental offices and the \nfacilities and privileges provided at those offices, such as public parking, are required to  be \ndesigned and constructed in accordance with the standards promulgated under the ADA. \n5 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG  Document 241-2  Filed 11/02/23  Page 6 of 15 \nACCORDINGLY, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED: \nIV.

INTRODUCTION \nA.  Background \n1.   This Consent Order (“this Order”) is entered into between Plaintiff United States \nand certain Rule 19 Defendants, namely and specifically, GAHC3 Bethlehem PA ILF, LLC \n(“GAHC3 Bethlehem”), GAHC3 Palmyra PA ALF, LLC (“GAHC3 Palmyra”), and GAHC3 \nBoyertown PA ALF, LLC (“GAHC3 Boyertown”) (GAHC3 Bethlehem, GAHC3 Palmyra, and \nGAHC3 Boyertown are collectively referred to herein as “the Rule 19 Defendants”). \n2.   The United States initiated this action on December 11, 2020, to enforce the \nprovisions  of  the  Fair  Housing  Act  (“FHA”),  42  U.S.C.  §§  3601-3619  and  the  FHA’s \nimplementing regulations, 24 C.F.R. §§ 100.200-100.205, as set forth in more detail in the Second \nAmended Complaint filed on April 23, 2021 (ECF 41), and as summarized below.  Specifically, \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 2 of 15\nthe United States’ Complaint alleges that J. Randolph Parry Architects, P.C. (“Parry”) and the \nowners during construction of certain covered multifamily properties, (collectively “the Design \nand  Construct  Defendants”)  have  designed  and  constructed  various  multifamily  properties, \nincluding, but not limited to, Traditions of Hanover, Traditions of Hershey, and Chestnut Knoll \n(collectively “the Rule 19 Subject Properties”), without required accessible features, and that this \nconduct constitutes a pattern or practice of discrimination and a denial of rights to a group of \npersons because of disability, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3)(C). \n3.   The  United  States’  Complaint  further  alleges  that  the  Design  and  Construct \nDefendants have, among other things, failed to design and construct the Rule 19 Subject Properties \nwith the features of accessible and adaptable design and construction required by Title III of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12213, and its implementing \nregulation, the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, 28 C.F.R. § 36.104; 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36 \nAppendix A (1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design), as amended at 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36 \nAppendix D (2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design) (hereinafter, the “ADA Standards”). \nB.  The Rule 19 Defendants and Their Respective Rule 19 Subject Properties \n4.   The Rule 19 Defendants herein are named in the United States’ Complaint as \nnecessary parties to this lawsuit in whose absence complete relief cannot be afforded to the United \nStates.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 19. \n5.   The parties acknowledge that this Order does not constitute, and should not be \nconstrued as, an admission of wrongdoing by the Rule 19 Defendants identified herein.   \ni.  GAHC3 Bethlehem \n6.   GAHC3 Bethlehem is the owner of the Traditions of Hanover Rule 19 Subject \nProperty.  Traditions of Hanover is an independent living community located at 5300 Northgate \nDr., Bethlehem, PA 18017.    \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 3 of 15\n7.   Sometime after its design and construction, Traditions of Hanover was sold to \nGAHC3 Bethlehem, which currently owns Traditions of Hanover. \nii.  GAHC3 Palmyra \n8.   GAHC3 Palmyra is the owner of the Traditions of Hershey Rule 19 Subject \nProperty.  Traditions of Hershey is an independent living and assisted living community located \nat 100 N. Larkspur Dr., Palmyra, PA 17078.    \n9.   Sometime after its design and construction, Traditions of Hershey was sold to \nGAHC3 Palmyra, which currently owns Traditions of Hershey. \niii.  GAHC3 Boyertown \n10.   GAHC3 Boyertown is the owner of the Chestnut Knoll Rule 19 Subject Property.  \nChestnut Knoll is an assisted living and memory care community located at 120 W. 5th St., \nBoyertown, PA 19512.    \n11.   Sometime after its design and construction, Chestnut Knoll was sold to GAHC3 \nBoyertown, which currently owns Chestnut Knoll. \nC.  Relevant Requirements of the Fair Housing Act \n12.   The  FHA  provides  that,  for  elevator  residential  buildings  with  four  or  more \ndwelling units, all units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, \nare “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible and \nadaptive design to make such units accessible to, or adaptable for use by, a person who has or \ndevelops a disability.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(B). \n13.   The accessible and adaptive design provisions of the FHA require that for covered \nmultifamily dwellings: (i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (ii) all the doors designed to allow passage \ninto and within all premises within such dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 4 of 15\npersons with a disability using wheelchairs; and (iii) all premises within such dwellings contain \nthe following features of adaptive design: (I) an accessible route into and through the dwelling; \n(II) light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible \nlocations; (III) reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and (IV) \nusable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about the \nspace.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C). \n14.   The Rule 19 Subject Properties are elevator buildings and were first occupied after \nMarch 13, 1991, and therefore all units at the Rule 19 Subject Properties are “covered multifamily \ndwellings” within the meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(B).  As such, those units and \nthe public and common use areas at the Rule 19 Subject Properties must comply with the accessible \ndesign requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C). \nD.  Relevant Requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n15.   The ADA and the ADA Standards, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A, which have been issued \nby the U.S. Department of Justice to implement the design and construction requirements of Title \nIII of the ADA, require that all “public accommodations” designed and constructed for first \noccupancy after January 26, 1993, and the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \naccommodations of those public accommodations, be readily accessible to and usable by persons \nwith disabilities in accordance with certain accessibility standards promulgated under that Act.  42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12182(a) and 12183(a)(1).  A rental or sales office for an apartment, condominium, or \npatio home complex is a “public accommodation” under the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). \n16.   The leasing offices at the Rule 19 Subject Properties were designed and constructed \nfor first occupancy after January 26, 1993.  Therefore, the leasing offices and the facilities and \nprivileges provided at those offices, such as public parking, are required to be designed and \nconstructed in accordance with the standards promulgated under the ADA. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 5 of 15\nE.  Consent of the Rule 19 Defendants to Entry of this Order \n17.   The Rule 19 Defendants agree that the units and the public and common use areas \nof the Rule 19 Subject Properties are subject to the requirements of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-\n3619. \n18.   The Rule 19 Defendants agree that the leasing office at the Rule 19 Subject \nProperties and the facilities and privileges provided at that leasing office, such as public parking, \nare subject to the requirements of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181, et seq., and its implementing \nregulation, the ADA Standards. \n19.   The Rule 19 Defendants agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the subject \nmatter of this case under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and 12188(b)(1)(B).   \n20.   As indicated by the signatures appearing below, the United States and the Rule 19 \nDefendants agree to the entry of this Order. \n  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND AGREED as follows: \nII.  GENERAL INJUNCTION \n21.   Without admitting or denying any allegation herein, the Rule 19 Defendants and \neach of their officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns, and all other persons in active \nconcert or participation with them shall refrain from engaging in conduct that denies the United \nStates or other persons or parties designated by the United States or the Court access to the public \nand common use areas, the covered multifamily dwellings, or the public accommodations areas at \nthe Rule 19 Subject Properties, and from engaging in any other action to impede any retrofits \nrequired to bring the Rule 19 Subject Properties into compliance with the FHA, the ADA, and the \nADA Standards. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 6 of 15\nIII.  RETROFITS  \nA.  Retrofits at the Rule 19 Subject Properties \n22.    The United States, as set forth herein and in its Second Amended Complaint, alleges \nthat the Rule 19 Subject Properties do not meet the accessibility requirements of the FHA, the \nADA, and the ADA Standards.  See ECF No. 41.  To address the United States’ allegations, the \nRule 19 Defendants will complete the actions, where applicable, and retrofits described in this \nSection.  \n23.   The United States confirms that it has been provided with access to the Rule 19 \nSubject Properties and, through its own agents and contractors, conducted all inspections necessary \nfor the purpose of implementing this Order. \n24.   The Rule 19 Defendants agree to allow access to the public and common use areas \nand covered multifamily dwelling unit interiors at their respective Subject Properties for the \npurpose of performing the retrofitting and inspections required under this Order. \n25.   The Rule 19 Defendants agree to halt all retrofits until the Rule 19 Subject \nProperties can be surveyed by the United States’ and/or Defendant Parry’s experts for the purposes \nof litigation.  \n26.   After the Rule 19 Subject Properties are surveyed for the purposes of litigation, the \nRule 19 Defendant for each  of the Rule 19 Subject Properties will complete the retrofits identified \nin Appendices A through I.  These retrofits will be completed within thirty-six (36) months from \nthe conclusion of the inspections discussed in paragraph 25, which time-frame may be extended \nper the terms of paragraph 44.  \n27.   If any architectural or engineering drawings are prepared as part of the retrofitting \nof any Rule 19 Subject Property, the Rule 19 Defendant for that Subject Property will provide \nthose drawings to the United States for comment and approval within fourteen (14) days of their \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 7 of 15\npreparation.  The United States will provide comments within forty-five (45) days.  The Rule 19 \nDefendant  for  that  Subject  Property  will  incorporate  those  comments  into  any  relevant \narchitectural or engineering plans and resubmit those to the United States for approval.  This \nprocess will continue until the United States has no further comments on any retrofit architectural \nor engineering plans.   \nB.  Notice, Inconvenience, and Overnight Stays for Retrofitting at the Rule 19 \n  Subject Properties \n28.   The Rule 19 Defendants will endeavor to minimize inconvenience to residents in \nscheduling and performing retrofits required by this Order at the Rule 19 Subject Properties.   \n29.   Within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of this Order, the Rule 19 Defendants \nwill provide a notice that is substantially equivalent to Appendix J to residents of the covered \ndwelling units at the Rule 19 Subject Properties.  The notice will inform residents in covered \ndwelling units that (1) the United States alleges that the covered dwelling units and public and \ncommon use areas do not meet the requirements of the FHA, the ADA, and the ADA Standards, \nand that to resolve these allegations, the appropriate Rule 19 Defendant has agreed to perform \ncertain retrofits to the public and common use areas and the covered dwelling units; (2) the covered \ndwelling unit must be retrofitted within thirty-six (36) months; (3) the Rule 19 Defendants will \nprovide resident with a schedule of when the retrofits will be performed; (4) the retrofits will be \nperformed at no cost to the resident; and (5) the Rule 19 Defendant will offer any resident of a unit \nscheduled to undergo a retrofit who will be dislocated from the unit for more than twelve (12) \nhours consecutively a similarly-sized furnished unit at that Subject Property at no cost.  In the \nevent that a similarly-sized furnished unit at that Subject Property is not available, the Rule 19 \nDefendant will pay the resident the applicable government per diem rate for food and lodging for \nthe local area (as available at www.gsa.gov– click on “per diem rates” under travel) for each day \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 8 of 15\nof undue inconvenience or hardship for the resident(s).  Such payment will be made prior to the \ncommencement of any retrofit work on the resident’s unit, so that the resident can use the payment \nto obtain alternative living accommodations and food while dislocated.  \n30.   If a resident desires to have the retrofits completed to the interior of his/her covered \ndwelling unit before the retrofits are scheduled to be performed by the Rule 19 Defendant, the \nresident may request the retrofits in writing, and the requests will be granted by the Rule 19 \nDefendant on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Rule 19 Defendant must complete the retrofits \nas promptly as practical, but no later than forty-five (45) days from the date on which the retrofits \nwere requested by a resident on a first-come, first-served basis.   \nIV.  NEUTRAL INSPECTOR AT THE RULE 19 SUBJECT PROPERTIES \n31.   The Rule 19 Defendants have or will enter into a contract with one or more neutral \ninspector(s)  to conduct on-site inspections of the retrofits that  have been performed under this \nOrder to determine whether the retrofits have been completed in accordance with the specifications \nin this Order’s Appendices A through I.  Prior to entering into the contract with the inspector(s), \nthe Rule 19 Defendants will submit the name(s) and resumes to the United States for approval.  \nThe inspector(s)  will have expertise in the Accessible Design Requirements of the FHA, ADA, \nADA Standards, ANSI A117.1-1986 and the HUD-recognized safe harbors, and such expertise will \nbe included in the submittal to the United States.   \n32.   An inspection of each Rule 19 Subject Property will take place within forty-five \n(45) days of the completion of all of the retrofits at each Subject Property as set forth in the relevant \nAppendix, or as soon thereafter as practicable for each.  The Rule 19 Defendants will give the \nUnited States at least twenty-one (21) days prior written notice of any inspection, including any \nsubsequent inspections as set forth in Paragraph 34, and will give the United States an opportunity \nto have its representatives present for the inspection. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 9 of 15\n33.   The inspections will be conducted by the inspector in accordance with Appendix \nK, which will be provided to the inspector by the Rule 19 Defendants.   \n34.   The inspector will set out the results of each inspection in an inspection report \n(“Inspection Report”), including deficits if any, in writing and will send that report to the Rule 19 \nDefendants and the United States.  The inspector will take digital photographs of any deficiencies \nidentified at each of the Rule 19 Subject Properties and will include those photographs in the \nInspection Report.  If the Inspection Report indicates that not all the required retrofits have been \nmade  as  specified  in  Appendices  A-I,  the  Rule  19  Defendants  will  correct  any  applicable \ndeficiencies within sixty (60) days and will pay for another inspection by the same inspector to \ncertify such deficiencies have been corrected.  This process, including prior written notice to the \nUnited States of any inspections, will continue until the inspector certifies that all the retrofits \nrequired under this Order have been made.  The Rule 19 Defendants will  pay all the inspector’s \nreasonable costs associated with these inspections of each Rule 19 Subject Property, and such \npayments will be made without regard to the inspector’s findings.  Upon reasonable notice to the \nRule 19 Defendants, representatives of the United States will be permitted to inspect the retrofits \nmade by the Rule 19 Defendants in accordance with this Order, to ensure compliance; provided, \nhowever, that the  United States will endeavor to minimize any inconvenience caused by such \ninspections. \nV.  NO RAISING OF RENT PRICES OR FEES \n35.   The Rule 19 Defendants may not raise the rent price of any dwelling unit, or \ndemand any deposit or other fee for a dwelling unit at the Rule 19 Subject Properties, solely \nbecause of contemplated or completed retrofits in a dwelling unit or common area. \nVI.  COMPLIANCE WITH DISCOVERY \n36.   The Rule 19 Defendants shall preserve in their current form any and all paper and \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 10 of 15\nelectronic records, documents, files, and recordings in their custody or control that relate to the \nRule 19 Subject Properties or other multifamily dwellings owned by the Rule 19 Defendants or \ntheir related entities and affiliates.  This includes, but is not limited to, all current and former tenant \nfiles, all lists of current and former residents, by unit, and all documents related to the design and \nconstruction of the Rule 19 Subject Properties.   \n37.    The Rule 19 Defendants shall respond to discovery requests by the United States in \naccordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 30, 33, and 34, without the need for the United States’ issuance of \nsubpoenas under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45.   \n38.   The Rule 19 Defendants shall abide by any subsequent protective order entered by \nthe Court.    \n39.   The Rule 19 Defendants agree to cooperate with any subsequent settlement, consent \norder, or court order regarding the Rule 19 Subject Properties, including providing current and \nformer tenant lists and identification and payment to aggrieved persons.    \nVII.  TRANSFER OF INTEREST IN RULE 19 SUBJECT PROPERTIES \n40.   The sale, foreclosure, or any other transfer of ownership, in whole or in part, \nwhether voluntary or involuntary, of the Rule 19 Subject Properties prior to the resolution of this \nlawsuit will not affect the Rule 19 Defendants’ continuing obligation to retrofit the Rule 19 Subject \nProperties as specified in this Order, nor any future retrofits ordered by the Court.  Should any of \nthe Rule 19 Defendants sell or transfer ownership of any of the Rule 19 Subject Properties, in \nwhole or in part, or any portion thereof, prior to the completion of the retrofits specified in Section \nIII of this Order, including those set out in Appendices A-I that may be deferred until the United \nStates and other Defendants in this litigation can come and inspect the Rule 19 Subject Properties, \nthe Rule 19 Defendants will, at least thirty (30) days prior to completion of the sale or transfer: (a) \nprovide to each prospective buyer written notice that the Rule 19 Subject Property is subject to \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 11 of 15\nthis Order, including specifically the Rule 19 Defendants’ obligations to complete required retrofit \nwork and to allow inspections, along with a copy of this Order; and (b) provide to the United \nStates, by e-mail and first-class mail, written notice of the intent to sell or transfer ownership, along \nwith a copy of the notice sent to each buyer or transferee, and each buyer’s or transferee’s name, \naddress, and telephone number.  \nVIII.  DURATION OF CONSENT ORDER AND TERMINATION OF LEGAL ACTION \n41.   This Order shall remain in effect until the end date of a subsequent consent order(s) \nor other order(s) by the Court that relate, in whole or in part, to the Rule 19 Subject Properties. \n42.   The Court shall retain jurisdiction for the duration of this Order to enforce the terms \nof this Order.  The United States may move the Court to extend the duration of this Order in the \ninterests of justice. \n43.   The United States and the Rule 19 Defendants shall endeavor in good faith to \nresolve informally any differences regarding interpretation of and compliance with this Order prior \nto bringing such matters to the Court for resolution.  However, in the event of a failure by any Rule \n19 Defendant to perform in a timely manner any act required by this Order or any subsequent \nconsent order(s) or other order(s) by the Court, or to otherwise act in conformance with any \nprovision thereof, the United States may move this Court to impose any remedy authorized by law \nor equity, including, but not limited to, an order requiring performance of such act. \nIX.  REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS \n44. If a resident of a unit at Traditions of Hershey or Chestnut Knoll that has a shower with \ninsufficient clear floor space requests a reasonable accommodation (i.e., transfer to a unit that has \nor has been retrofitted to have sufficient clear floor space under the terms of this Consent Order), \nthe Rule 19 Defendants shall transfer the resident to a comparable unit type if available, or \nprioritize the resident’s request for the next available comparable unit type.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 12 of 15\n45. These transfers shall be made at no cost to the resident (e.g., transfer fees or moving \ncosts).  Provided, however, that if the resident voluntarily chooses to move to a larger unit type, \nRule 19 Defendants may charge their regular monthly fees for such units.  This obligation shall be \nconsidered part of the Rule 19 Defendants’ reasonable accommodation obligations under the Fair \nHousing Act and will survive the expiration of this Order.  \n46. Within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Order, Rule 19 Defendants will notify \nall current residents of this policy, and they will inform all future residents of this policy at the \ntime of leasing.    \nX.  TIME FOR PERFORMANCE \n47.   Any time limits for performance imposed by this Order may be extended by the \nmutual written agreement of the United States and the Rule 19 Defendants.   \nXI.

The Rule 19 Defendants acknowledge the United States may, in its discretion, seek \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 213   Filed 01/10/23   Page 13 of 15\nadditional monetary damages and/or retrofits from Defendant Parry, Westrum Hanover, LP, AMC \nDelancey Traditions of Hershey Partners, LP, and/or One Boyertown Properties, LP, which are \nnot  currently  provided  for  herein  or  in  Appendices  A-I.    The  Rule  19  Defendants  further \nacknowledge any consent order or judgment entered for monies to perform these additional retrofit \nrequirements or to compensate Aggrieved Persons payable to individuals under a Non-Rule 19 \nConsent Order is not payable to the Rule 19 Defendants, unless otherwise ordered by the Court or \nin accordance with a contract between Defendant Parry, Westrum Hanover, LP, AMC Delancey \nTraditions of Hershey Partners, LP, and/or One Boyertown Properties, LP and Rule 19 Defendants \nfor the performance of those additional retrofits.  The Rule 19 Defendants agree to cooperate with \nthe United States to determine costs of any additional retrofits not otherwise identified in in \nAppendices A-I. \n51.

Am. Compl. at 1-2, 23-26, ECF No. 10. The defendants \nnamed are original owners and architects of the dwelling complexes. Id. at 8-9. The complaint \nalso names the complexes’ current owners as Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 19 defendants for \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JFL   Document 37   Filed 04/20/21   Page 3 of 6\npurposes of relief. Id. at 9-10; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(A).

The FHA requires that certain multifamily dwellings developed for first occupancy \nafter March 13, 1991, defined in the FHA as “covered multifamily dwellings,” contain specified \naccessibility features to make them accessible to persons with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f).  \n3.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  This action is brought by the United States to enforce provisions of the Fair Housing \nAct (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12181-12189.  Specifically, the United States’ Second Amended Complaint alleges that \nDefendants have engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against persons with disabilities \nand denied rights to a group of persons because of disability by failing to design and construct \ncovered multifamily dwellings with the features of accessible and adaptive design and construction \nrequired by the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3), and as required by the ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12183(a)(1).  See ECF No. 41.  These covered multifamily dwelling units include \nproperties for seniors, including independent living, assisted living, and memory support dwelling \nunits.   \n2.  The  United  States  and  Defendant  HCRI  Pennsylvania  Properties,  Inc.,  a \nPennsylvania  corporation  (“HCRI”  or  “Defendant”),  have  entered  into  this  Consent  Order \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 235   Filed 06/05/23   Page 2 of 67\n(hereinafter “Order”) (collectively “Parties”) and agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the \nsubject matter of this case under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and \n12188(b)(1)(B).  The Parties further agree that this controversy should be resolved without further \nproceedings and without an evidentiary hearing or a trial. \n3.  Specifically, as to HCRI, the United States alleges that HCRI engaged in a pattern \nor practice of discrimination and a denial of rights based on disability when it failed to design and \nconstruct the Birches of Harleysville with the accessibility features required by the FHA and ADA.  \nThe United States’ Second Amended Complaint alleges that accessibility violations at the Birches \nat Harleysville include, but are not limited to, barriers at accessible routes, barriers at common-use \nlaundry rooms, activity rooms, and amenities, unit closets that are too narrow, and insufficient \nclear floor space in unit bathrooms.   \n4.  HCRI denies that it engaged in any form of intentional or willful discrimination \nagainst persons with disabilities and states that at all times it has  attempted to comply with all \napplicable federal laws, including those requiring accessibility such as the FHA and ADA in the \ndesign and construction of the Birches at Harleysville by, inter alia, contracting with experienced \ndesign and construction professionals.  HCRI acknowledges that its obligations to comply with the \nFHA and the ADA are non-delegable, and it must comply with the FHA and the ADA itself despite \nassurances of compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, guidelines, and ordinances \nmade by these design and construction professionals.  \n5.  The Parties agree that this Order is being entered into by HCRI as a compromise of \ndisputed claims, and to avoid the cost and burden of litigation, and should not be deemed an \nadmission of liability by HCRI.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 235   Filed 06/05/23   Page 3 of 67\n6.  As indicated by the signatures appearing below, the Parties agree to the entry of \nthis Order. \nII.  DEFINITIONS \n7.  “Subject Property” means the Birches at Harleysville, a memory care and personal \ncare facility located at 691 Main Street, Harleysville, PA 19438 and referred to in the Complaint, \nas amended, as “Phase 2” of the “Arbour Square” property and/or as the “Birches at Arbour \nSquare.”  For specificity, the “Birches at Harleysville” does not refer to the properties identified \nin the Complaint, as amended, as “Phase 1” or “Phase 3” of the “Arbour Square” property,. \n8.  “Defendant” means HCRI Pennsylvania Properties, Inc..  \n9.  “Accessible Design Requirements” means the requirements that are listed in the \naccessible and adaptive design provisions of the FHA and stated in paragraph 15.  \n10.  “Inspection Report” is the report created after the implementation of the retrofits \nrequired in Appendices A and B, and Neutral Inspection by an inspector which will describe any \ndeficiencies in the required retrofits at the Subject Property, including digital photographs.  \nIII.  RECITALS \nA.  Subject Property \n11.  As set forth herein, and in the Second Amended Complaint, HCRI owned the \nBirches at Harleysville at the time of its the design and construction. The Birches at Harleysville \nis a 69-unit memory care and personal care facility that offers various amenities to its residents.   \nCare HSL Harleysville PropCo LP is the current owner and operator of the Birches at Harleysville.  \n12.  For purposes of this Order, the Parties agree that the Birches at Harleysville is \nsubject to the accessible design and construction requirements of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1), \n(f)(2), and (f)(3), and the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 235   Filed 06/05/23   Page 4 of 67\nB.  Relevant Requirements of the Fair Housing Act \n13.  The FHA provides that, for residential buildings with an elevator consisting of four \nor more dwelling units, all units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after March \n13, 1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible \nand adaptive design to make such units accessible to or adaptable for use by persons with \ndisabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(A). \n14.  The FHA provides that, for non-elevator residential buildings with four or more \ndwelling units, all ground-floor units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after \nMarch 13, 1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of \naccessible and adaptive design to make such units accessible to or adaptable for use by persons \nwith disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(B). \n15.  The  Accessible  Design  Requirements  in  the  FHA  for  covered  multifamily \ndwellings include: (i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings must be readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (ii) all the doors designed to allow passage \ninto and within all premises within such dwellings must be sufficiently wide to allow passage by \npersons with a disability using wheelchairs; (iii) all premises within such dwellings must contain \nthe following features of adaptive design: (I) an accessible route into and through the dwelling; \n(II) light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible \nlocations; (III) reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and (IV) \nusable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about the \nspace.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).   \n16.  For the purposes of this Order, HCRI agrees that the Subject Property was designed \nand constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, and therefore all the units in buildings \nwith elevators and the ground-floor units in non-elevator buildings at the Subject Property are \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 235   Filed 06/05/23   Page 5 of 67\n“covered multifamily dwellings” within the meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(A) and \n(B).  As such, those units and the public and common use areas, including the accessible pedestrian \nroutes at the Subject Property, must comply with the Accessible Design Requirements of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)(3)(C).   \nC.  Relevant Requirements of the ADA \n17.  The ADA and the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, ADA Accessibility \nGuidelines for Buildings and Facilities, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A (“ADA Standards”), that have \nbeen issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Department”) to implement the design and \nconstruction requirements of Title III of the ADA, also require that all “public accommodations” \ndesigned  and constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, and the goods, services, \nfacilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of those public accommodations, be readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with certain accessibility \nstandards promulgated under that Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12182(a) and 12183(a)(1).  A rental or sales \noffice for an apartment, condominium, or patio home complex is a “public accommodation”  under \nthe ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E).   \n18.  For the purposes of this Order, HCRI agrees that the rental offices at the Subject \nProperty were designed and constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, and therefore \nthe rental offices and the facilities and privileges provided at those offices, such as public parking, \nare required to be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards  promulgated under \nthe ADA. \nACCORDINGLY, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED: \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 235   Filed 06/05/23   Page 6 of 67\nIV.  GENERAL INJUNCTION \n19.  HCRI and its officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns, and all other \npersons in active concert or participation with them, are enjoined from discriminating on the basis \nof disability as prohibited by the FHA and the ADA.   \nV.  RETROFITS  \n20.  The United States, as set forth herein and in its Second Amended Complaint, alleges \nthat the Subject Property does not meet the accessibility requirements of the FHA and, with respect \nto the sales and rental offices, the ADA, and the ADA Standards.  See ECF No. 41.  To address \nthe United States’ allegations, HCRI will complete the actions and retrofits described in this \nSection. \n21.  As soon as reasonably possible, but not later than twenty-four (24) months from the \nentry  of this  Order,  HCRI  will complete the  retrofits  to  the  Subject  Property  identified  in \nAppendices A and B.   \n22.  If any architectural or engineering drawings are prepared as part of the retrofitting \nof the Subject Property, HCRI will provide those drawings to the United States for comment and \napproval within fourteen (14) days of their preparation.  The United States will provide \ncomments within forty-five (45) days.  HCRI will incorporate those comments into any relevant \narchitectural or engineering plans and resubmit those to the United States for approval.  This \nprocess will continue until the United States has no further comments on any retrofit \narchitectural or engineering plans.    \nVI.  INCONVENIENCE  AND  OVERNIGHT  STAYS  FOR  RETROFITTING  AT \nSUBJECT PROPERTIES \n23.  HCRI will endeavor to minimize inconvenience to residents in scheduling and \nperforming retrofits required by this Order at the Subject Property.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 235   Filed 06/05/23   Page 7 of 67\n24.  Within thirty (30) days from the entry of this Order, HCRI will provide a notice that \nis substantially equivalent to Appendix C to Care HSL Harleysville Propco LP to provide to the \npresent residents of the covered dwelling units at the Subject Property.  The notice will inform \nresidents in covered dwelling units that (1) the United States alleges that the covered dwelling \nunits and public and common use areas do not meet the requirements of the FHA, the ADA, and \nthe ADA Standards; (2) HCRI denies these allegations but has agreed to cooperate with the United \nStates to resolve these allegations, HCRI has agreed to perform certain retrofits to the public and \ncommon use areas and the covered dwelling units; (3) the covered dwelling unit must be retrofitted \nwithin twenty-four (24) months; (4) HCRI will provide residents with a schedule of when the \nretrofits will be;(5) the retrofits will be performed at no cost to the resident; and (6) HCRI will, in \nconsultation with the current owner, offer any resident of a unit scheduled to undergo a retrofit \nwho will be dislocated from their unit for more than twelve hours consecutively a fully furnished \nunit at the property if one is available.  If no unit is available, or relocation of the resident is not \nfeasible given the circumstances of the resident, HCRI will be relieved of the time limitation in \nwhich to complete retrofits for that particular unit, and the retrofit inspection procedures described \nin Paragraphs 26 - 29 below can proceed without completion of the retrofits to that particular unit.  \nThe required retrofits must be completed to the unit when turned for a new resident, or three \nmonths prior to the end of the current term of this Order, whichever is sooner.  Photographic \nevidence in compliance with the requirements of Appendix D of the retrofits performed at those \nspecific  units  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  sufficient  evidence  of  the  retrofit  absent \ninspection by the neutral inspection.        \n25.  If a resident desires to have the retrofits completed to the interior of his/her covered \ndwelling unit before the retrofits are scheduled to be performed by HCRI, the resident may request \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 235   Filed 06/05/23   Page 8 of 67\nthe retrofits in writing, and the requests will be granted by HCRI on a first-come, first-served basis.  \nHCRI must complete the retrofits as promptly as practical, but no later than forty-five (45) days \nfrom the date on which the retrofits were requested by a resident on a first-come, first-served basis.   \nVII.  NEUTRAL INSPECTOR  \n26.  HCRI has or will enter into a contract with one or more neutral inspector(s)  to \nconduct on-site inspections of the retrofits that have been performed under this Order to determine \nwhether the retrofits have been completed in accordance with the specifications in this Order’s \nAppendices A and B.  Prior to entering into the contract with the inspector(s), HCRI will submit \nthe name(s) and resumes to the United States for approval.

If the surface appears to be warped, take \nadditional measurements in order to report the full nature and extent of \nthe existing conditions. \n \ne.  Slopes at curb ramps:  \n \ni.  Running slopes: measure running slopes at the base and top of \neach curb ramp run.  Measure running slopes at approximately \nthe center of each top and bottom landing.  Measure running \nslopes of aprons with the level aligned with the back of the curb \nline.  Take additional measurements as needed to document \nwarped conditions. \n \nii.  Cross slopes: measure cross slopes at the base and top of each \ncurb ramp run.  Measure cross slope at approximately the center \nof each top and bottom landing.  Take additional measurements \nas needed to document warped conditions. \n \nf.  Slopes at parking spaces and access aisles:  \n \ni.  Running slopes: measure running slopes at the top, middle, and \nbottom of each parking space and each access aisle.  \nMeasurements should be taken as close to the middle of the \nspace (from side to side) as possible.  If the space is occupied, \ntake measurements at both sides.  Take additional \nmeasurements as needed to document warped conditions or \ndeteriorated asphalt. \n \nii.

June 22, 2022 \nI.  OVERVIEW \nThe United States seeks to enforce the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) and the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”) against the owners of certain senior living facilities and against \nthe architect who designed them. The United States claims that these senior living homes fall \nshort of the FHA’s and ADA’s disability accessibility requirements.  \nThe architect has moved for judgment on the pleadings arguing that a federal statute of \nlimitations and two states’ statutes of repose should limit the United States’ claims. For the \nreasons that follow, the Court denies the architect’s motion.   \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \na.  Allegations & Procedural History \nThe United States brought this lawsuit to address conditions at fifteen facilities that \nallegedly render the facilities inaccessible to individuals with disabilities. Eleven of these \nfacilities were allegedly built more than five years before the commencement of this lawsuit. \nSecond Am. Compl. (“Compl.”) ¶¶ 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21. Four of these facilities \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 183   Filed 06/22/22   Page 2 of 6\nare located in Pennsylvania and were allegedly built more than twelve years before the \ncommencement of this lawsuit. Compl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 9, 11. Three other of these facilities are located in \nNew Jersey and were allegedly built more than ten years before the commencement of this \nlawsuit. Compl. ¶¶ 15, 20, 21.  \nAs a default rule, the United States Code provides a five-year statute of limitations for \nlawsuits brought to enforce civil “fine” or “penalty” provisions. 28 U.S.C. § 2462. Unrelated to \nthis federal rule, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have statutes of repose that require victims of \ndesign or construction defects to bring their suits within a certain time after a construction \nproject is completed. Pennsylvania’s statute bars suits brought more than “12 years” after \nconstruction has been completed. 42 Pa. C.S. § 5536(a). New Jersey’s statute bars suits brought \nmore than “10 years” after construction has been completed. N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:14-1.1. \nDefendant J. Randolph Parry Architects (“the Architect”) has moved for judgment on the \npleadings asserting the federal statute of limitations and Pennsylvania’s and New Jersey’s \nstatutes of repose as bars to the United States’ recovery. The Architect’s motion is presently \nbefore the Court. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD  \n“After the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move \nfor judgment on the pleadings.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(c).  We will grant the motion only “if, on the \nbasis of the pleadings, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed Cetera, LLC v. \nNat’l Credit Servs., Inc., 938 F.3d 466, 469 n.7 (3d Cir. 2019). \nMotions for judgment on the pleadings are governed by “the same standards that apply to \na Rule 12(b)(6) motion.”  Wolfington v. Reconstructive Orthopaedic Assocs. II PC, 935 F.3d 187, \n195 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting Revell v. Port. Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 598 F.3d 128, 134 (3d Cir. 2010)).  \n2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 183   Filed 06/22/22   Page 3 of 6\nAccordingly, the Court must determine whether a pleading contains “sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). A claim is facially plausible when the pleading \nalleges enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the \nclaim’s necessary elements. Walker v. Coffey, 956 F.3d 163, 166 (3d Cir. 2020).  \nIn evaluating a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court must “view the facts” and \n“the inferences to be drawn” from those facts in the “light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” \nWolfington v. Reconstructive Orthopaedic Assocs. II PC, 935 F.3d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 2019).  \nIV.  ANALYSIS  \nThe fundamental problem with the Architect’s motion is that it misconceives the nature \nof the United States’ claims. The United States claims that the Architect engaged in a pattern or \npractice of discrimination by repeatedly failing to design facilities accessibly. Accordingly, the \nUnited States has not brought fifteen claims—one for each of the facilities identified in the \nSecond Amended Complaint—against the Architect under each statute. Instead, the United \nStates has brought a single claim against the Architect under each statute. Each facility that the \nArchitect allegedly designed and constructed inaccessibly represents a constitutive act of the \nUnited States’ overarching pattern or practice claims rather than an independent basis for \nliability. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 381 (1982) (Plainly the [pattern or \npractice] claims . . . are based not solely on isolated incidents involving the two respondents, but \na continuing violation manifested in a number of incidents.”).  \nBecause the United States brings a single pattern or practice claim under each statute, the \nfederal limitations period for suits to collect civil penalties poses no obstacle. Actions to collect \nthese civil penalties must be “commenced within five years” of when the pattern or practice \n3 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 183   Filed 06/22/22   Page 4 of 6\nclaim “accrued.” 28 U.S.C. § 2462.1 A claim accrues when the “factual and legal prerequisites \nfor filing suit” have come into existence. 3M Co. (Minnesota Min. & Mfg.) v. Browner, 17 F.3d \n1453, 1460 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In a pattern or practice claim, the factual prerequisite to filing suit \ncomes into existence upon the completion of the final incident that makes up the pattern or \npractice. Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 381. Accordingly, so long as one of the incidents \nmaking up a pattern or practice has occurred within the statute of limitations, the pattern and \npractice claim is timely.   \nHere, the United States alleges that the Architect designed and constructed at least one \nfacility in 2020—well within five years of when this lawsuit was commenced. Compl. ¶ 17. \nBecause the United States has plead that at least one of the incidents making up the alleged \npattern or practice occurred within the statute of limitations, the United States’ pattern or practice \nclaim is timely, and the Court must deny the Architect’s motion for judgment on the pleadings \ninsofar as the motion is based on the federal statute of limitations for civil penalties. Bethel v. \nJendoco Const. Corp., 570 F.2d 1168, 1174 (3d Cir. 1978) (“If the [time]bar is not apparent on \nthe face of the complaint, then it may not afford the basis for a dismissal of the complaint.”).2 \nThe Architect’s argument that the United States’ claims are barred by state statutes of \nrepose fails for a conceptually similar reason. It is undisputed that at least eight of the facilities \n \n1 Neither the FHA nor the ADA imposes a statute of limitations for actions brought by \nthe Attorney General. 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a); 42 U.S.C. § 12188(b). But the parties agree that the \ndefault federal statute of limitations apply to actions brought under these statutes for civil \npenalties. See ECF No. 155 at 8–9. \n2 Resisting this conclusion, the Architect cites two design and construct disability \ndiscrimination cases in which district courts declined to find continuing violations: United States \nv. Taigen & Sons, Inc., 303 F. Supp. 2d 1129 (D. Idaho 2003) and Moseke v. Miller & Smith, \nInc., 202 F. Supp. 2d 492 (E.D. Va. 2002). But these cases are inapposite. In those cases, the \nplaintiffs did not identify any discriminatory actions taken by the defendants within the \napplicable statute of limitations. Taigen & Sons., 303 F. Supp. 2d at 1144; Moseke, 202 F. Supp. \n2d at 507.  \n4 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 183   Filed 06/22/22   Page 5 of 6\ninvolved in the United States’ pattern or practice claim are unaffected by Pennsylvania’s and \nNew Jersey’s statutes of repose. So, even if the Court were to accept the dubious proposition that \nthese state statutes of repose were intended to preclude civil rights suits3 and are not preempted \nfrom doing so4, the statutes still would not foreclose either of the United States’ pattern or \npractice claims.  \nSince the statutes of repose would not warrant an entry of judgment against the United \nStates on either of its claims against the Architect, the Court must deny the Architect’s motion \ninsofar as it relies upon these statutes of repose. 5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure § 1367 (3d ed.) (“[I]f the pleadings do not resolve all of the \nfactual issues in the case, proceeding with discovery and potentially a trial on the merits would \nbe more appropriate than an attempt at resolution of the case on a Rule 12(c) motion”). \nV.  CONCLUSION \nBecause the United States has plead a plausible pattern or practice of discrimination with \nat least one incident occurring within the federal limitations period, the Court cannot enter \njudgment on the pleadings in favor of the Architect on the United States’ claims for civil penalties. \nAnd because Pennsylvania’s and New Jersey’s statutes of repose would not resolve the Architect’s \n \n3 The Architect has not identified a single case in which either Pennsylvania’s or New \nJersey’s statute of repose was applied to preclude a civil rights or discrimination suit, nor has the \nCourt been able to find one.  \n4 As the Architect itself points out, Pennsylvania’s and New Jersey’s statutes of repose \nfunction not only to limit the remedies available to tardy plaintiffs but to abolish a cause of \naction entirely. Noll by Noll v. Harrisburg Area YMCA, 537 Pa. 274, 280 (1994) (“As a statute of \nrepose, Section 5536 does not merely bar a party's right to a remedy as a statute of limitations \ndoes, but it completely abolishes and eliminates the cause of action”); Rosenberg v. Town of N. \nBergen, 61 N.J. 190, 199 (1972) (“The injured party literally has No [sic] cause of action . . . The \nfunction of the statute [of repose] is thus rather to define substantive rights than to alter or \nmodify a remedy.”). It is difficult to imagine a stronger candidate for implied conflict preemption \nthan a state statute that purports to abolish a federal cause of action.  \n5 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 183   Filed 06/22/22   Page 6 of 6\nentire pattern or practice claims—if the statutes of repose were even applicable to those claims—\nthe Court cannot enter judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Architect based on those statutes.  \n \n            BY THE COURT: \n   \n/s/ John M.

May 23, 2022 \nI.  OVERVIEW \nThis is a civil rights suit. The United States is seeking to enforce the Fair Housing Act \n(“FHA”) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) against the owners of certain senior \nliving facilities and against the architect who designed them. The United States claims that these \nsenior living homes fall short of the FHA’s and ADA’s disability accessibility requirements.  \nThe architect claims that it is not responsible for most, if any, of the facilities’ alleged \nshortcomings. Rather than rely on this position as a defense to liability, however, the architect \nhas attempted to assert three crossclaims against each of its Co-Defendants and to implead thirty-\nnine additional Defendants into this case on the basis that they are the true parties responsible. In \neffect, the architect has attempted to transform this case into a construction defect case.  \nThe United States has moved to strike or dismiss the architect’s Third-Party Complaint. \nTwo groups of Defendants have also filed motions to dismiss the architect’s crossclaims. For the \nreasons that follow, the Court grants each of these motions.   \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 170   Filed 05/24/22   Page 2 of 8\na.  Allegations & Procedural History \nThe United States brought this lawsuit to address conditions at fifteen facilities across \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, and Connecticut that allegedly rendered the facilities \ninaccessible to individuals with disabilities.

The \nUnited States named fourteen Defendants in its lawsuit.  \nSeven of those Defendants are entities that owned the facilities at issue when they were \nfirst built. Id. ¶¶ 23–31. Six of the Defendants are entities that have come to own the facilities but \nthat did not own the properties when they were built. Id. ¶¶ 32–37. The remaining Defendant is \nJ. Randolph Parry Architects (the “Architect”), which is the firm that allegedly was responsible \nfor designing and building each of the fifteen facilities. Compl. ¶ 22.  \nThe Architect maintains, however, that it was not involved in designing or constructing at \nleast some of the allegedly inaccessible features. The Architect claims that, insofar as these \nfeatures are inaccessible, the fault rests with its Co-Defendants and other service providers.  \nTo this end, the Architect filed an Answer asserting three crossclaims—express \nindemnification, implied indemnification and contribution (the “Crossclaims”)—against each \nCo-Defendant. ECF No. 62. The Architect also filed a Third-Party Complaint against thirty-nine \nconstruction service providers asserting the same claims of express indemnification, implied \nindemnification and contribution. ECF No. 62-1.1 \n \n1 The Crossclaims and Third-Party Complaint also include a claim for “declaratory \nrelief.” See J. Randolph Parry Architects’ Answer at 21 (ECF No. 62); Third-Party Complaint at \n14 (ECF No. 62-1). The Architect does not specify whether it pleads this claim under the federal \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, or Pennsylvania’s Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 \nPa. C.S. § 7533. Under federal law, declaratory relief is a remedy, not a cause of action. Davis v. \nUnited States, 499 F.3d 590, 594 (6th Cir. 2007) (“§ 2201 does not create an independent cause \nof action.”). Because federal courts’ remedial powers are shaped by Congress rather than by state \nlegislatures, this Court will construe the Architect’s pleadings as though they seek declaratory \nrelief as a remedy rather than as a standalone cause of action. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 170   Filed 05/24/22   Page 3 of 8\nIn response, the United States filed a motion to strike or dismiss the Architect’s Third-\nParty Complaint. ECF No. 75. Defendants GAHC3 Bethlehem, GAHC3 Palmyra, and GAHC3 \nBoyertown filed a motion to dismiss the Architects’ Crossclaims in which Defendant LifeQuest \njoined. ECF Nos. 71, 73. And Defendants One Newtown Properties, HCRI Pennsylvania \nProperties, Care HSL Newtown PropCo, Care HSL Harleysville Propco, Westrum Hanover, and \nBoyertown Properties also filed a motion to dismiss the Architects’ Crossclaims. These three \nmotions are presently before the Court. \nThese motions raise a wide variety of challenges to the legal sufficiency of the \nCrossclaims and Third-Party Complaint. Beyond those challenges, the motions also ask the \nCourt to dismiss the Architect’s claims as a matter of discretion. The Court agrees that these \nclaims should be dismissed as a matter of discretion, so the Court does not reach the legal \nsufficiency of the Architect’s claims. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD  \nThe Architect pleads only one basis for the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over its \nCrossclaims and Third-Party Complaint: supplemental jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 1367. \nCrossclaims ¶1; Third-Party Compl. ¶ 41. Under certain circumstances, federal courts have \ndiscretion not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c); see also City of \nChicago v. Int'l Coll. of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 172 (1997) (quoting United Mine Workers of \nAm. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966)) (“[P]endent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not \nof plaintiff’s right.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nSpecifically, a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state \nlaw claim when (1) the claim raises a “novel or complex issue of State law”; (2) the claim \n“substantially predominates over the claim . . . over which the district court has original \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 170   Filed 05/24/22   Page 4 of 8\njurisdiction”; (3) the district court “has dismissed all claims over which it has original \njurisdiction”; or (4) in “exceptional circumstances” where there are “other compelling reasons \nfor declining jurisdiction.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). In determining whether to exercise supplemental \njurisdiction, the court must also consider the principles of “judicial economy, convenience, and \nfairness to the litigants.” Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware Cnty., Pa., 983 F.2d 1277, 1284 (3d \nCir. 1993). \nIV.  ANALYSIS  \nThe Architect pleads three claims against each of its Co-Defendants and the Third-Party \nDefendants: implied indemnification, express indemnification and contribution. Each of these \ncauses of action flows from state law. Def.’s Opp. Mot. Strike or Dismiss Third-Party Compl. at \n20 (ECF No. 93). If accepted into this case, these state law claims would substantially \npredominate over the federal claims upon which this Court’s original jurisdiction is founded. \nFurther, accepting jurisdiction over these claims would not, on balance, serve the principles of \njudicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the litigants. Accordingly, the Court will exercise \nits discretion under 28 U.S.C. 1367(c)(2) to decline jurisdiction over these claims. \nA claim may “substantially predominate” in multiple ways, including with respect to the \n“issues” the claim would raise and with respect to the “proof” the claim would require. United \nMine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966). If the number and complexity of the \nissues a state claim would raise or the quantity of evidence a state claim would require would \noverwhelm the evidence and issues involved in the federal claim within the court’s original \njurisdiction, a court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Borough of W. Mifflin v. \nLancaster, 45 F.3d 780, 789 (3d Cir. 1995) (approving of declining supplemental jurisdiction \nwhere “permitting litigation of all claims in the district court can accurately be described as \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 170   Filed 05/24/22   Page 5 of 8\nallowing a federal tail to wag what is in substance a state dog”). \nThe Architect’s claims would inundate this Court with state law issues that have no \nbearing on the claims within the Court’s original jurisdiction. The claims within the Court’s \noriginal jurisdiction are the United States’ claims under the FHA and ADA. To resolve the \nUnited States’ claims, the Court need only determine whether the facilities at issue are in fact \nnon-compliant under the terms of the FHA and ADA and whether the Defendants were in fact \ninvolved in the designing and constructing of those facilities. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C); 42 \nU.S.C. 12183(a)(1). \nThe Architect’s claims would require the Court to reach far beyond these two issues. The \nArchitect’s express indemnity claims would require the Court to address a plethora of issues \nunder state contract law to determine whether an express indemnity agreement exists and is not \nvoid against public policy. See, e.g., Richardson v. John F. Kennedy Mem'l Hosp., 838 F. Supp. \n979, 990 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (explaining that express indemnity actions are governed by contract \nlaw); 68 P.S. § 491 (declaring certain indemnity contracts requiring owners or contractors to \nindemnify architects “void as against public policy”). Further, the Court would likely have to \nengage in a conflicts of law analysis to determine which state’s interpretive law applies to each \ncontract. The Architect’s implied indemnity claims would require the Court to determine \nwhether the Architect’s relationship and agreements with each Co-Defendant and Third-Party \nDefendant were such that indemnification could be implied and whether the Architect’s role in \nthe non-compliance could be characterized as passive. City of Wilkes-Barre v. Kaminski Bros., \n804 A.2d 89, 94 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2002) (limiting recovery to passive tortfeasors). And the \nArchitect’s contribution claims would require the Court to determine the apportionment of fault \namong the Architect, its Co-Defendants and the Third-Party Defendants for each feature of the \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 170   Filed 05/24/22   Page 6 of 8\nfacilities that is found non-compliant. 42 Pa. C.S. § 8324.  \nBecause the Architect seeks to implead thirty-nine Defendants and has asserted \ncrossclaims against each of its thirteen Co-Defendants, the state law issues raised in the \nCrossclaims and Third-Party Complaint must be multiplied by a factor of fifty-two. And the \nnumber of these issues will likely continue to grow exponentially as the Architect’s Co-\nDefendants and Third-Party Defendants assert their own state law counterclaims and crossclaims \nfor indemnity or contribution.  \nIn terms of proof—the Architect’s claims would require significantly more proof than the \nclaims within this Court’s original jurisdiction. To prove its claims, the United States will have \nto present evidence indicating only that the facilities at issue are covered by the FHA and ADA, \nthat the Defendants had a role in designing and constructing the facilities, and that the features \nare in fact non-compliant with the statutes. By contrast, the Architect’s crossclaims and third-\nparty claims would require the introduction of evidence of the relationships among the parties, \ntheir contracts, communications and courses of performance with each other, their relative \ninvolvement in designing and constructing the facilities, and possibly even industry custom and \npractice. And, again, the Architect asserts its claims against fifty-two Defendants, so the \nadditional proof made relevant by the Architect’s claims must be multiplied by at least a factor of \nfifty-two.   \n  The principles of judicial economy, convenience, or fairness to the litigants would not be \nserved by accepting jurisdiction over these state law claims.  \nIt is true that judicial economy tends to be served when related claims are tried in a single \nproceeding. Efficiently. Ambromovage v. United Mine Workers of Am., 726 F.2d 972, 989 (3d \nCir. 1984). Here, however, the savings to judicial economy are reduced by the fact that many of \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 170   Filed 05/24/22   Page 7 of 8\nthe Architect’s claims may be mooted by the resolution of the United States’ claims. If indeed \nthe Architect is found not liable for some of the United States’ claims, then the Architect’s \nclaims for contribution will become entirely moot because the Architect would not be a joint \ntortfeasor. 42 Pa. C.S. § 8324 (making contribution available only to “joint tort-feasors”) \n(emphasis added). And if the Architect is found liable, then the Architect’s claims for implied \nindemnity will be moot. Kaminski Bros., 804 A.2d at 93 (“If the record provides any basis for \nfinding the plaintiff primarily negligent, it will defeat indemnification.”). If this Court accepts \njurisdiction over the Architect’s claims, the Court will likely have to resolve a bevy of \npreliminary questions as to the viability of the Architect’s claims for indemnity and contribution \nunder state law only to have those questions be rendered moot, and the Court’s decisions \nrendered advisory opinions, by the jury’s findings on the merits. Such an outcome would not be \nin the interest of judicial economy.  \nAnd while the Architect might find it more convenient to litigate all its potential claims \nagainst every potential defendant in the same case, the inconvenience, cost and delay to the other \nparties greatly outweighs the Architect’s convenience. Accepting jurisdiction over the \nArchitect’s claims would likely cause the other parties to undertake expensive discovery and pre-\ntrial litigation on claims that will not even be ripe for decision until after the jury renders a \nverdict on the claims within this Court’s original jurisdiction. \nFinally, the principle of fairness to the parties militates against accepting jurisdiction over \nthese claims. The Architect will not be deprived of any defense if the Court declines jurisdiction \nover its Crossclaims and Third-Party Complaint. Even absent these claims, the Architect may \nstill maintain that it had no role in designing or constructing the facilities’ allegedly non-\ncompliant features. And if that position is borne out by the evidence, then the Architect will have \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 170   Filed 05/24/22   Page 8 of 8\na complete defense to liability. On the other hand, allowing this case to be transformed into a \nwide-ranging construction defect case would be unfair to the United States, who brought this suit \npursuant to its duty to enforce federal civil rights statutes. It would also be unfair to the \nArchitect’s Co-Defendants, for whom closure in this matter will be delayed by the time it takes \nthis Court to disentangle the complex web of relationships among the Architect and the Third-\nParty Defendants. \nQuite simply, this case came into federal court as a federal civil rights enforcement \naction. Accepting supplemental jurisdiction over the Architect’s claims would transform this \ncase into a wide-ranging construction defect case. The Architect’s state law claims would simply \ninundate this Court with state contract, tort, contribution and indemnity law issues and the proof \nrelated to them. This inundation, and the substantial delay it would cause, would come at the \nexpense of the alleged victims of disability discrimination and the vindication of their federal \nrights. Rather than sideline the federal rights that are at the core of this case, the Court will \ndecline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Architect’s claims.   \nV.  CONCLUSION \nThe Architect’s Crossclaims and Third-Party Complaint would inject into this case state \nlaw claims that would substantially predominate over the claims within this Court’s original \njurisdiction. The principles of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the litigants would \nnot be served by accepting jurisdiction over these claims. Accordingly, the Court declines to \nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Architect’s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(2). \n            BY THE COURT: \n   \n/s/ John M.

INTRODUCTION\nA. Background\n1. This Consent Order is entered into between Plaintiff United States and Rule 19\nDefendant 1180 Ben Franklin Way LLC, including affiliated entities 200 Lillian Lane LLC and \n7080 Brooks Farm Road LLC (“1180 Ben Franklin”). \n2. The United States initiated this action on December 11, 2020, to enforce the provisions\nof the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 and the FHA’s implementing \nregulations, 24 C.F.R. §§ 100.200-100.205, as set forth in more detail in the Second Amended \nComplaint filed on April 23, 2021 (ECF 41), and as summarized below (the “Action”).  \nSpecifically, the United States’ Complaint alleges that J. Randolph Parry Architects, P.C. and the \n1 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 50   Filed 11/02/21   Page 2 of 13\n \n \nowners of certain covered multifamily properties, (collectively “the Design and Construct \nDefendants”) have designed and constructed various multifamily properties, including, but not \nlimited to, Keystone Villa, Heritage Green, and Daybreak (collectively “the 1180 Ben Franklin \nProperties”), without required accessible features, and that this conduct constitutes a pattern or \npractice of discrimination and a denial of rights to a group of persons because of disability, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(3)(C), and 3614(a). \n3. The United States’ Complaint further alleges that the Design and Construct Defendants \nhave, among other things, failed to design and construct the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties with \nthe features of accessible and adaptable design and construction required by Title III of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12213, and its implementing \nregulation, the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, 28 C.F.R. § 36.104; 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36 \nAppendix A (1991 ADA Standards for Accessible Design), as amended at 28 C.F.R. Pt. 36 \nAppendix D (2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design) (hereinafter, the “ADA Standards”). \nB.  1180 Ben Franklin and The 1180 Ben Franklin Properties \n4. 1180 Ben Franklin is the owner of the Keystone Villa property.  Keystone Villa is an \nassisted living and memory care community located at 1152 Ben Franklin Hwy East, \nDouglassville, PA 19518.    \n5. Sometime after its design and construction, Keystone Villa was sold to 1180 Ben \nFranklin, which currently owns Keystone Villa. \n6. 7080 Brooks Farm Road LLC, an entity affiliated with 1180 Ben Franklin, is the \nowner of the Heritage Green property.  Heritage Green is an assisted living and memory care \ncommunity located at 7080 Brooks Farm Road, Mechanicsville, Virginia 23111. \n7. Sometime after its design and construction, Heritage Green was sold to 7080 Brooks \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 50   Filed 11/02/21   Page 3 of 13\n \n \nFarm Road LLC, which currently owns Heritage Green. \n8.  200 Lillian Lane LLC, an entity affiliated with 1180 Ben Franklin, is the owner of the \nDaybreak property.  Daybreak is an assisted living and memory care community located at 201 \nLillian Lane, Lynchburg, Virginia 24502. \n9. Sometime after its design and construction, Daybreak was sold to 200 Lillian Lane \nLLC, which currently owns Daybreak. \n10. 1180 Ben Franklin is named in the United States’ Complaint as a necessary party to \nthis lawsuit in whose absence complete relief cannot be afforded to the United States.  See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 19. \n11. The parties acknowledge that this Consent Order does not constitute, and should not \nbe construed as, an admission of wrongdoing by 1180 Ben Franklin as identified herein.   \nC.  Relevant Requirements of the Fair Housing Act \n12. The FHA provides that, for elevator residential buildings with four or more dwelling \nunits, all units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, are \n“covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible and \nadaptive design to make such units accessible to, or adaptable for use by, a person who has or \ndevelops a disability.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(A). \n13. The FHA further provides that, for non-elevator buildings with four or more dwelling \nunits, all ground floor units that are designed and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, \n1991, are “covered multifamily dwellings” and must include certain basic features of accessible \nand adaptive design to make such units accessible to, or adaptable for use by, a person who has \nor develops a disability.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and (f)(7)(B). \n14. The accessible and adaptive design provisions of the FHA require that for covered \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 50   Filed 11/02/21   Page 4 of 13\n \n \nmultifamily dwellings: (i) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily \naccessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (ii) all the doors designed to allow passage \ninto and within all premises within such dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by \npersons with a disability using wheelchairs; and (iii) all premises within such dwellings contain \nthe following features of adaptive design: (I) an accessible route into and through the dwelling; \n(II) light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible \nlocations; (III) reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and (IV) \nusable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about \nthe space.  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C). \n15. Keystone Villa and Daybreak properties are elevator buildings and were first \noccupied after March 13, 1991, and therefore all units are “covered multifamily dwellings” \nwithin the meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(A).  Heritage Green is a non-elevator \nbuilding and was first occupied after March 13, 1991, and therefore all the ground floor units are \n“covered multifamily dwellings” within the meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(7)(B).  As \nsuch, those units and the public and common use areas at the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties must \ncomply with the accessible design requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C). \nD.  Relevant Requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n16. The ADA and the ADA Standards, 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, app. A, which have been issued \nby the U.S. Department of Justice to implement the design and construction requirements of Title \nIII of the ADA, require that all “public accommodations” designed and constructed for first \noccupancy after January 26, 1993, and the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \naccommodations of those public accommodations, be readily accessible to and usable by persons \nwith disabilities in accordance with certain accessibility standards promulgated under that Act.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 50   Filed 11/02/21   Page 5 of 13\n \n \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12182(a) and 12183(a)(1).  A rental or sales office for an apartment, condominium, \nor patio home complex is a “public accommodation” under the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). \n17. The leasing offices at the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties were designed and \nconstructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993.  Therefore, the leasing offices and the \nfacilities and privileges provided at those offices, such as public parking, are required to be \ndesigned and constructed in accordance with the standards promulgated under the ADA. \nE.  1180 Ben Franklin’s Consent to Entry of this Order \n18. 1180 Ben Franklin agrees that the units as described above and the public and \ncommon use areas of the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties are subject to the requirements of the \nFHA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619. \n19. 1180 Ben Franklin agrees that the leasing office at the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties \nand the facilities and privileges provided at that leasing office, such as public parking, are subject \nto the requirements of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181, et seq., and its implementing regulation, \nthe ADA Standards. \n20. 1180 Ben Franklin agrees that this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of \nthis case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 3614(a) and 12188(b)(1)(B).   \n21. As indicated by the signatures appearing below, the United States and 1180 Ben \nFranklin agrees to the entry of this Consent Order.  This Order is final and binding.  It sets forth \nall of the obligations incumbent on, and all of the relief sought from, 1180 Ben Franklin and its \nsuccessors and assigns arising out of or resulting from the claims the United States has or may \nhave brought against them for alleged violations of the ADA, the ADA Standards and/or the \nFHA. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-06249-JMG   Document 50   Filed 11/02/21   Page 6 of 13\n \n \n  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND AGREED as follows: \nII. GENERAL INJUNCTION \n22. Subject to the terms set forth herein, 1180 Ben Franklin and each of its officers, \nemployees, agents, successors, and assigns, and all other persons in active concert or \nparticipation with them, shall refrain from engaging in conduct that denies the United States or \nother persons or parties designated by the United States or the Court reasonable access to the \npublic and common use areas, the covered multifamily dwellings, or the public accommodations \nareas at the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties, and from engaging in any other action to impede any \nretrofits required to bring the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties into compliance with the FHA, the \nADA, and the ADA Standards. \nIII. DISCOVERY AND RETROFITS AT THE 1180 BEN FRANKLIN PROPERTIES \n23. Upon reasonable notice, and in accordance with 1180 Ben Franklin’s standard rules \nand regulations for third-party access and health and safety requirements and procedures, 1180 \nBen Franklin shall allow the United States and its expert access to the units (including unit \ninteriors) at the 1180 Ben Franklin Properties for inspection, including but not limited to \nphotographing by the United States’ expert(s), including providing required notice to tenants.  \nAccess shall be provided on reasonable notice from the United States.   \n24.
