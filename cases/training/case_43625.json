Even more, the United States \ngovernment and its USDA officials, the DEFENDANTS herein, have engaged and continue to \nengage in an institutional and insidious racism and conspiracy to interfere with the Black American \nFarmers’ civil rights and liberties. \n2.  To this day, the promise remains elusive for all Black Americans, Black American \nFarmers and their heirs, merely because of their race, Black.   \n3.  The racial hatred and animus perpetrated by the USDA, dubbed, “The Last \nPlantation,” persist like a plague. The DEFENDANTS, through intention, deceit, passivity, inaction \nand benign neglect, have knowingly allowed and even encouraged top government administrators \nand lawyers as well as local federal Farm Service Agency officials across this land to trample on the \n                                                 \n1 It is well established that the US Constitution Bill of Rights constitute two types of individual \nprotections - civil rights and civil liberties.  Civil Rights are those rights that the government is obligated to \nprotect between parties.  Civil Liberties are those same exact rights but the government is prohibited from \ninfringing upon. (Citation omitted)  The USDA fails, intentionally and with malice, at both.  \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 4 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 5 of 62\ncivil rights of the Class Representatives and to make a mockery of our precepts of freedom. \nDEFENDANTS, individually and jointly, knew or should have known that these blatant violations \nof law run rampant throughout every single agency in the mammoth USDA, “The Last Plantation.” \n The DEFENDANTS have admitted their misdeeds and overt violations of law.  Yet, they continue \ntheir terror against Black Farmers with an indescribable callous disregard, all in the face of judicial, \nlegislative and public scrutiny.      \n4.  This action is brought to dispel the notion that the United States government and its \nUSDA officials can further employ a repugnant racial animus in denying any American citizens, in \nthis matter, Black Farmers and their heirs, the benefits of any federal program or activity on the basis \nof their race, BLACK, and to vindicate the Class Members’ rights as guaranteed by the UNITED \nSTATES CONSTITUTION.    \nII. \nNATURE OF THE CASE\n  5.  This case involves DEFENDANTS’ administration, during the period January 1, \n1997 to August 30, 2004, of the USDA and the applications by American Black Farmers for farm \nloans and credit and participation in federal farm programs, (referred to hereinafter as, generally, \n“farm programs”).  PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS \ncontend that DEFENDANTS, when processing applications of African-American farmers for farm \nprograms (1) willfully discriminated against them, and (2) when, in response, PLAINTIFFS and all \nsimilarly situated black farmers filed written discrimination complaints with DEFENDANTS, \nDEFENDANTS failed, although required by, inter alia, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act and 7 C.F.R. §§ 2,28, 15.52 et. seq. to investigate the complaints.  For \nexample, when African-American farmers filed complaints of discrimination with DEFENDANTS, \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 5 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 6 of 62\nDEFENDANTS willfully either (1) avoided processing and  resolving the complains by stretching \nthe review process out over many years; (2) conducted a meaningless, or “ghost investigation”, or \n(3) failed to do anything.  These two acts: (1) the discrimination in denial of the application and (2) \nthe failure to properly investigate the discrimination complaints, deprived the African-American \nfarmers, inter alia, of equal and fair access to farm credit and farm programs, and due process, \nresulting in damages to them. \n  6.  In May, 1997, DEFENDANTS’ officials admitted that in early 1983, the Reagan \nadministration had quietly disbanded and dismantled the civil rights enforcement arm at United \nStates Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and that discrimination complaints had not been \nproperly investigated since that time.  Two federal reports, issued in February, 1997, verified these \nfacts.  \n  7.  In the Pigford v. Veneman  Black Farmers Class Action Complaint, related to the \ncase brought here, a settlement agreement was reached resulting in the denial of benefits to \nthousands of Black Farmers who had filed or could have applications for credit and who filed \ncomplaints of discrimination during the period January, 1983 to December 31, 1996.   \n  8.  Since the filing of the Pigford v. Veneman original complaint, 97cv01978 (PLF), \nnumerous annual reports by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, US Civil Rights Commission, \nGeneral Accounting Office, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and private groups, i.e., \nthe Environmental Working Group, have chronicled the treatment of Black Farmers beyond January \n1, 1997, those PLAINTIFFS, Black Farmers and their heirs, who that now seek justice as the BFAA, \nInc. (Post-Pigford) Class.    \nIII. \nJURISDICTION\n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 6 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 7 of 62\n9.  Jurisdiction is founded upon FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT2, US Const.,  15 \nU.S.C.  §1691, et seq. 28 U.S.C. §1331, 28 U. S.

BFAA, Inc has state \nchapters throughout the United States, and it asserts associational standing to bring suit based on (a) \nits members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to \nprotect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claims asserted nor the relief \nrequested necessarily requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.

There are ___ Individual Class representatives, each of which falls under one of  three \nsubclasses. \n (a)  Plaintiff  and  Class  representatives,  Robert  and  Laverne  Williams  (“Williams”), \n(Subclass A), are African-American farmers and residents of Roscoe, Nolan County, Texas. \nWilliams (1) timely applied for various loan programs with DEFENDANTS during the years \n1997 to 2004 and was the subject of willful and continuous racial discrimination, including \ndenial of his applications for farm ownership loans, and refusal to provide operating credit, \nand appropriate loan servicing, by reason of his race, causing him substantial damages, (2) \ntimely  filed  complaints  with  DEFENDANTS  of  these  acts  of  discrimination,  which \ncomplaints were denied by DEFENDANTS, although such denial was contrary to the facts \nand applicable law causing them substantial damages, and (3) who suffered reprisal as a \nresult of attempting to protect their rights by filing civil rights complaints and/or settling \ncomplaints. \n(b)  Plaintiff and Class Representative Charlie Scott (“Scott”) is a Black Farmer who farms \nin Fayette County, Tn.  Scott is a prevailing Pigford claimant who received the $50,000 cash \npayment in 2000.  Scott applied for a farm operating loan and/or credit in February 2001, \nand was denied the credit and operating because Defendants retaliated against Scott for filing \na claim and receiving benefit there from. The denial of this credit was due to racial \ndiscrimination and reprisal against Mr. Scott. This was acknowledged at the highest level of \nthe agency. The rejection of the FO by the County Committee was directly counter to \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 8 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 9 of 62\nAgency regulations as well as to its own actions before and after the FO loan decision. Mr. \nScott and thousands like him have suffered continued discrimination and reprisal, from 1997 \nthru 2004, even though they applied for the credit, was eligible for the credit and was denied \nsuch credit when white farmers received preferential treatment regarding such credit and \nloan extension.  \n(c)  Plaintiff and Class Representative Larry Thomas (“Thomas”) is a farmer in Earl, \nArkansas.  Thomas made application for a farm operating loan in February, 2000. Thomas \nreceived the farm operating loan, however, the loan was received in late July, two months \ntoo late for the planting season, and the loan was inadequate relative to the application made. \nScott is now facing land foreclosure.  Thomas did not receive assistance as a socially \ndisadvantaged farmer.  Thomas was qualified for an adequate loan, applied for an adequate \nloan and was denied an adequate a timely loan while white farmers received adequate loans, \ntimely loans, and assistance from USDA county officials.       \nEach of the remaining Class members is an African-American farmer and resident of any one \nof the fifty states of the union who (a) timely applied for loans and/or program payments \nwith DEFENDANTS during the period of January 1, 1997 – August 30, 2004, was qualified \nfor such credit and/or payments, yet denied and who were the subject of willful and \ncontinuous racial discrimination, and (b) timely filed a complaint or complaints with \nDEFENDANTS of these acts of discrimination, which complaint(s) was/were never acted \nupon pursuant to the applicable law, causing the black farmer substantial damages, TO WIT \n   \n   (1)  Plaintiff STOVALL  - Plaintiff and proposed Class representative, Michael \nStovall, (“Stovall”) is an African-American farmer and resident of Town \nCreek, Alabama, and resides at 2881 County Rd. 262, Town Creek, Alabama \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 9 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 10 of 62\n 35672, and whose phone number is (256) 685-9490.  Mr. Stovall (a) timely \napplied for various loan programs with defendant during the period of  1993 \nthrough  2001  and  was  the  subject  of  willful  and  continuous  racial \ndiscrimination, including refusal of applications, refusal to process his loan \napplications in a timely manner, intentionally falsifying information to thwart \nStovall’s efforts in obtaining loans and in farming, and (b) timely filed \nnumerous complaints of these acts of discrimination with defendant, which, \nalthough, after OCR found that discrimination had occurred, OCR never \nformally entered a Final Agency Decision as required after a finding of \ndiscrimination.  However, after settlement negotiations, settlement was \nreached between Stovall and Defendant, but said settlement agreement was \nnever acted on by Defendants. \n \n      Mr. Stovall suffered racially-based disparate treatment at the hands of FSA in \nbeing denied access to the full range of FSA farmer lending program \nalternatives while at the same time providing financial relief to white farmers \nin similar situations; in being refused applications with which to apply for \nloan assistance, and intentionally delaying and/or denying Stovall operating \ncapital for which he qualified pursuant to law.  As a result, Stovall suffered \nsubstantial loss of farm income, loss of creditworthiness in his community, \nlost opportunities to purchase additional farmland and to increase his stock, \nfailure to upkeep his present assets, and, although a finding of discrimination \nby the USDA’s Office of Civil Rights, and a properly negotiated settlement \nagreement, Defendant illegally failed to comply with such finding and \nagreement, therefore, causing  irreparable and related damages to Stovall. \n \n   (2)  Plaintiffs DAVIS -  Plaintiffs and proposed Class-representatives Dexter \nDavis and Phyllis Davis  (“The Davises”) are African American farmers who \nreside in Sondheimer, East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, whose address is Route \n1, Box 240, Sondheimer, LA 71276.  Dexter Davis is a second-generation \nfarmer.  The Davis’ (a) timely applied for loan programs and were the subject \nof willful and continuous racial discrimination, including failure to process \ntheir loan applications in a timely manner, and (b) timely filed complaints \nwith defendant of these acts of discrimination, which complaints were never \nacted upon pursuant to applicable law, and for which the Davises also \nsuffered retaliation, causing them substantial damages.   \n \n      The Plaintiffs have filed numerous discrimination complaints based on \ndiscrimination and retaliation because FSA officials used information that \nwas not applicable to a loan applications due to a former agreement with \nUSDA.; on or about July, 2001, The Davises, after applying for a farm and \nhome operating loan, were told in advance by FSA official Steve Dooley that \nhe  was  not  going  to  approve  the  loan,  in  violations  of  standard  loan \nprocessing procedure, and in, fact denied the loan, causing them substantial \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 10 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 11 of 62\ndamages. \n \n      The Davises suffered race-based disparate treatment in being denied timely \nconsideration by FSA of their loan applications, which in turn caused \ndamaging delays in planting of crops.  These failures to provide timely \nconsideration happened on an ongoing bias over the years 1998 through \n2004. \n \n   (3)  Plaintiff HILDEBRANDT  - Plaintiff and proposed Class Representative \nGeorge Hildebrandt (“Hildebrandt”) is an African-American farmer residing \nin Leavenworth, Leavenworth County, Kansas.  His address is 34324 159th \nStreet, Leavenworth, KS  66048 and telephone number is (913) 651-4648.  \nMr. Hildebrandt (a) timely applied for various loan programs with defendant \nduring the years 1981 to the year 1999 and was the subject of willful and \ncontinuous racial discrimination, including failure to process his applications \nin a timely manner, being declined for loans and/or disaster assistance \nwithout even being provided an application, failure to timely inform him of \napproval and failure to inform him that his funds were being managed by \nFSA and (b) timely filed complaints of these acts of discrimination with \ndefendant,  which  complaints  were  never  acted  upon  pursuant  to  the \napplicable law, causing him substantial damage. \n \n      Hildebrandt’s complaints were closed for improper reasons and due to the \ninefficiency of FSA/USDA/OCR’s actions.  However, after years of inquiry, \nand  re-filing  of  complaints,  it  was  April,  2003,  that  OCR  informed \nHildebrandt that it was reviewing its prior actions and fully recognized the \ntimeliness of his complains and Hildebrandt’s case was reopened.  In July, \n2003, Sidney Wiggins, a USDA investigator,  contacted Hildebrandt to \nobtain names of witnesses to interview, and it was not until June, 2004, that \nthe USDA/OCR forwarded its Final Agency Decision and advised that they \nfound no discrimination in the activities or conduct of FSA.  Hildebrandt \nknows that out of  ten or twelve witnesses provided to the investigator, only \ntwo were interviewed, therefore, a fair and unbiased investigation was never \nconducted.    Additionally,  OCR  did  not  use  proper  evidence  in  their \ninvestigation of Hildebrandt’s complaints but merely recited the FSA County \nAgent’s recollection, interpretation and handwritten notes as evidence as \nwhether or not discrimination occurred.   \n \n      Hildebrandt’s substantial damages and losses are due to defendant’ race-\nbased and disparate denial of loans and assistance and OCR’s failure to \nprocess  his  complaints  in  a  timely  manner,  including  the  improper \ninvestigation, if any, of his complaints. \n \n   (4)  Plaintiff BRADSHAW  - Plaintiff and proposed Class representative ROD \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 11 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 12 of 62\nBRADSHAW is an African American farmer, residing in Jetmore, Ford \nCounty, Kansas, whose address is 704 Clay, Jetmore, KS  67854 and whose \nphone number is (620) 357-8511.  Mr. Bradshaw is a farmer who (a) timely \napplied for various loan programs with defendant’s agency, FSA, for the \nyears 1997 – 2004 and was the subject of willful and continuous racial \ndiscrimination, including refusal of all applications in the past three years, \nbeing transferred from one FSA office to another, continuous offsets of all of \nBradshaw’s government payments, retaliation due to Bradshaws successful \nappeal of an illegal offset in 1999, attempts to obtain incorrect appraisals of \nBradshaw’s property to lower his net worth and thereby making him illegible \nfor  many  USDA  programs  and  loans,  and  the  continuous  delay  in \nimplementation of any assistance.  All of these discriminatory actions by \ndefendant have caused Bradshaw to suffer frustration, humiliation, anxiety, \nand other mental distress at his inability to obtain redress from USDA for the \nracial discrimination, including related damages for Bradshaw and his family \nsuffering. \n \n   (5)  Plaintiff TURNER  - Plaintiff and proposed Class Representative BURNIS \nTURNER, (“Turner”)is an African American farmer, who resides at 4333 \nFM 514, Point, Texas  75472.  Mr.  Turner is a farmer who (a) timely applied \nfor a loan with defendant’s agency, FSA, for the year 2000, and was the \nsubject of willful and continuous racial discrimination, including loan denial \nusing  improper  information  as  a  basis  for  denial  and  (b)  timely  filed \ncomplaints with defendant of these acts of discrimination.  Such complaint \nwas, and although a request was made for reinstatement based on good cause, \nsaid request was never acted upon pursuant to the applicable law, causing \nhim additional substantial damages. \n \n   (6)  Plaintiff HALL  - Plaintiff and proposed Class Representative GEORGE \nHALL, (“Hall”) is an African American farmer who resides at County Road \n133, Route 2, Box 163-A, Boligee, Alabama 35442.  His phone number is \n(205) 372-9458.    Mr. Hall (a) timely filed his applications for various loans \nfunds with the defendant during the years beginning in 2001.  Mr. Hall was \nsubjected to willful and continuous racial discrimination from his local FSA \noffice, including denial of loan funding and timely filed his complaint in \nJanuary 20, 2003. \n \n      Hall experienced disparate treatment and racial discrimination including \ninitial refusal by defendant provide the initial requested assistance including \nrefusal of the FSA County Agent to process the application and/or notify Hall \nof the agency decision and improperly applying administrative offsets for \nprogram monies that Hall was entitled to and  not subject to offsets.  The \nresults of this discriminatory action has caused severe financial reversals and \ndamages to Hall’s creditworthiness, and related losses, including, but not \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 12 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 13 of 62\nlimited to mental and emotional distress. \n    \nDEFENDANTS \n \n13.

HOW  DEFENDANTS  ARE  ORGANIZED  AND,  GENERALLY,  THE \nGOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AT ISSUE \n \n15.  USDA’s Farm Service Agency (“FSA”) provides commodity program benefits (such \nas deficiency payments, price support loans, conservation reserve benefits), disaster payments, farm \nloans and other farm credit benefits to U. S. farmers.  The agency was created in 1994, as a result of \na  reorganization  of  USDA,  primarily  by  the  merger  of  the  Agricultural  Stabilization  and \nConservation Service (“ASCS”, which previously had handled commodity program benefits, price \nsupport loans, CRP payments, disaster payments, and related services) with the Farmers Home \nAdministration (“FmHA”, which previously had provided farm loans and other farm credit benefits). \n16.  The FmHA was created decades ago to provide loans, credit and technical assistance \nfor formers.  FmHA made loans directly to farmers or guaranteed the loans made to farmers by \nprivate, commercial lenders.  These loans included “farm ownership”, “operating”, and “continuing \nassistance” loans, as well as loans that “restructure” existing loans and” emergency disaster” loans. \n17.  ASCS was an agency of USDA created to provide services to U. S. farmers under the \nprice support, deficiency payment, CRP, and related programs to stabilize farm income and prices, \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 16 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 17 of 62\nand to assist in the conservation of land.  It was consolidated into the Farm Service Agency in 1994. \n18.  DEFENDANTS Veneman is responsible for the administration of the Farm Service \nAgency  (FSA) and previously FmHA & ASCA.  FSA, like FmHA and ASCS before it, administers \nthe federal farm programs through a three-tiered review system consisting of (a) county offices and \ncommittees, (2) state offices and committees, and (3) a federal level of review in Washington, D.C., \nthe National Appeals Division (“NAD”).  The local county committees consist of producers from a \ncounty who have been elected by other producers in that county; they oversee the county offices.  \nThe state committees consist of producers from each state selected by the Secretary of USDA; they \noversee the state officers.  At the federal level NAD renders final determinations of administrative \nappeals. (Prior to the 1994 consolidation, FHA had its own administrative appeal process).   \nB.  PROCEDURE BY WHICH FARMERS (1) APPLIED FOR LOANS AND CREDIT \nWITH  FmHA  AND  (2)  APPLIED  FOR  PARTICIPATION  IN  OTHER  FARM \nPROGRAMS WITH ASCS \n \n19.  Traditionally, when a farmer applied for any FmHA loan or program, he went to his \ncounty office (formerly the FmHA office), and filled out a Farm and Home Plan (FHP), which \nrequired the assistance and guidance of DEFENDANTS’ officials to complete.  Assistance and \nguidance was critical because of the complexity of the programs and forms.  This application \nprocess was done pursuant to regulations found at 7 C.F.R. §1910, et seq.) and Commodity Credit \nCorporation (“CCC”) regulations (7 C.F.R. at §1400, et seq.). \n20.  When the FmHA loan application with its supporting documents was completed it \nwas presented to the county committee.  If approved, the loan was processed.  The Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act (“ECOA”) prohibits discrimination in credit based on sex, marital status, race, \ncolor, age, or national origin, religion, etc. (15 U.S.C. §1691 (a) ).  If an FmHA loan was denied on \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 17 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 18 of 62\ndiscriminatory grounds, the farmer could file a complaint of discrimination with the Secretary of \nUSDA,  the  FmHA  –  Equal  Opportunity  (“EO”)  office  or  with  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights \nEnforcement and Adjudication (“OCREA”), or both. \n21.  With respect to ASCS-type programs, the application was reviewed by the CED and \nthen presented to the county committee.  If approved, the ASCS benefits were awarded.  Title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits exclusion of participation I federal programs based on race, \ncolor or natural origin.  With respect to ASCS-type applications, if a farm program application was \ndenied on discriminatory grounds, the farmer could file a complaint of discrimination with the \nSecretary of USDA or OCREA. \nC.  USDA NON DISCRIMINATION REGULATIONS  (7 C.F.R. §§ 2.28, 15.51 AND \n15.52, AS AMENDED)\n   \n  22.  As early as 1966, which was eight years prior to ECOA’s enactment, USDA \npromulgated internal management guidelines proscribing discrimination based on Arace, color, \nreligion, sex, age, disability, or national original@ in the administration of any of its direct programs \nand activities.  See 7 C.F.R.  §§ 15.51, 15.52).  See also 31 Fed. Reg. 8175, 8175 (June 10, 1966). \nThese  guidelines  have  remained  in  effect  continuous  since  then  and  include  a  voluntary \nadministrative mechanism by which USDA receives complaints of discrimination involving any \nUSDA program, including the farm credit and ASCS subsidy programs at issue in This case.  See 7 \nC.F.R. §15.52.  Under § 15.52(a), a person who believes he or she have been the victim of \ndiscrimination in programs conducted directly by USDA may file a complaint with USDA’s Office \nof Civil Rights (“OCR”) within 180 days from the date the person knew or should have known of the \nalleged discrimination. OCR then investigates the complaint and determines the corrective actions, if \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 18 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 19 of 62\nany, required to resolve it.  7 C.F.R. §15.52(b).  The regulation sets no deadline by which OCR must \nact on a complaint, it does not establish requirements for how an investigation should be conducted \nor a claim reviewed, and it does not require that USDA advise a complainant regarding the \ndetermination of, or corrective action taken in response to, her complaint.  USDA’s decision to \npromulgate section 15.51 and 15.52 was a voluntary and unilateral one, see 54 Fed. Reg. 31,163, \n31,163(July  27,  1989);  50  Fed.  Reg.  25,687,  25,687(June  21,1985),  and  the  filing  of  an \nadministrative complaint under section 15.52 is not a prerequisite to filing suit against USDA under \nECOA or any other statute.  Instead, section 15.52 was designed to enable USDA to police itself \ninternally and correct any discriminatory conduct that might arise in programs USDA administers \ndirectly.  See 54 Fed. Reg. 31,163, 31,163-164(July 27, 1989) (citing 5 U.S.C. §301) See also 7 \nU.S.C. §15.50.  The USDA Office of Civil Rights has failed at its own regulations and intentionally \nviolates all authorizing federal statutes.  \n  23.  In an effort to give the USDA Civil Rights program more authority, the Congress \nauthorized the creation of a new presidential appointee, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.  \nPresident Bush nominated and the US Senate confirmed Mr. Vernon Parker as Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Rights on April 3, 2003.   \nD.  THE USDA OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS REFUSES TO EXECUTE THE LAW OF \nCIVIL RIGHTS; USDA/OCR: A DISMAL AND INTENTIONAL FAILURE \n   \n24.  The USDA Office of Civil Rights, administered by DEFENDANTS PARKER,  \nthrough Delegation of Authority from DEFENDANTS VENEMAN, has been consistently criticized \nby several government agencies, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, US Commission on \nCivil Rights, etc., by Congressional committees and by its own Office of Inspector General for \nfailing and refusing to conduct its administrative and  regulator authorities, timely, in good faith and \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 19 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 20 of 62\nin accordance with constitutional, statutory   This failure stems from the USDA’s admitted shut \ndown of the Office of Civil Rights by the Reagan White House to the benign neglect by  \nDEFENDANTS  PARKER and VENEMAN who have failed, through acquiescence, omission and \nblatant intention, to settle one administrative complaint, among the thousands of pending complaints, \nby a minority farmer since DEFENDANT PARKER’s appointment as the Assistant Secretary for \nCivil Rights.  DEFENDANT PARKER has refused and continues to refuse to exercise, to the \ndetriment of PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS and others \nsimilarly situated3, the Delegation of Authority in the Code of Federal Regulations, § 7 CFR,  which \nin detail delineates  the authority and conduct of the USDA’s administrative civil rights program.   \nPLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS and thousands with similar \nsituations have suffered, and in all probability will continue to suffer, as a result of detrimental \nreliance on DEFENDANTS PARKER and VENEMAN and their legally mandated, but non-\nimplemented, administrative civil rights complaint and resolution process.  On information and \nbelief, DEFENDANTS VENEMAN and PARKER have refused and continue to refuse to execute \nthe law and regulations of the land in furtherance of their discriminatory and illegal attempt to \ndestroy the black farm family.   \nVI. \nTHE HISTORICAL OVERVIEW \nPRE PIGFORD V. VENEMAN AND RESULTING CONSENT DECREE\n \nA.  HOW PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS AND \nMEMBERS OF THE PIGFORD CLASS WERE DAMAGED; WHAT DEFENDANTS \nDID IN RESPONSE TO ALL COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION\n                                                 \n3 On information and belief, DEFENDANT PARKER, with the tacit consent of DEFENDANT \nVENEMAN, on are about August 15, 2003, capriciously and arbitrarily dismissed approximately 3000 \nadministrative complaints of discrimination filed by black farmers employing a self-serving inter-office \nregulation that additional information had to be provided by the complainants within a legally unreasonable \nfifteen period.   \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 20 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 21 of 62\n \n25.  Unbeknownst to all PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK \nFARMERS and members of each Black Farmer Class, including the one at bar, DEFENDANTS \ndisbanded the enforcement ability of EO and OCREA in 1983, leaving DEFENDANTS with no \nability to investigate discrimination complaints.  In a May 25, 1997 Richmond News Dispatch \nArticle and interview of Lloyd Wright, Director of USDA office of Civil Rights, Mr. Wright stated \nthat (1) no systematic probes or investigations had been taken since 1983, when the Reagan \nadministration disbanded the Civil Rights investigative staff, and (2) that agency regulations and the \nprovisions  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  et  al.  were  violated.    Further  evidence  of \nDEFENDANTS’ willful failure to investigate discrimination complaints is evident in the February \n27, 1997,, Office of Inspector General Report (“OIG”), and the February, 1997 Civil Rights Action \nTeam Report (“CRAT”), both explained below. \n26.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) was required to ensure that Federal agencies met \ntheir  Title  VI  enforcement  obligations  and  provide  civil  rights  protection  to  persons  filing \ndiscrimination complaints in the FSA programs.  DOJ failed to ensure that DEFENDANTS met its \nTitle VI obligations. \n27.  Within USDA, The Policy Analysis and Coordination Center (PACC), an agency \nunder the Assistant Secretary for Administration, was responsible for civil rights compliance and \ndeveloping regulations for processing program discrimination complaints at USDA. [OIG Report, \np.4] OCREA was responsible for processing program discrimination complaints received by USDA \nfrom participants in FSA programs.  [OIG Report, p.4] \n28.  OCREA was required to forward written complaints form FSA program participants \nof discrimination to the appropriate agency with USDA asking the agency to attempt conciliation of \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 21 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 22 of 62\nthe complaint.  If conciliation was not successful, the agency was to be instructed to perform a \npreliminary inquiry and make a recommendation of a finding of discrimination.  If conciliation was \nnot successful, the agency was to be instructed to perform a preliminary inquiry and make a \nrecommendation of a finding of “discrimination” or “no discrimination”.  OCREA was to perform \nits own analysis of the complaint and the preliminary inquiry and make a recommendation to the \nAssistant Secretary for Administration on the finding of “discrimination” or “no discrimination”.  \nThis process never occurred during the relevant period covered by this lawsuit.  [OIG Report, p.4] \n29.  FSA’s Civil Rights and Small Business Staff (CR&SBUS) were responsible for \nhandling program discrimination complaints within FSA.   \n30.  The applicable State Civil Rights Coordinator in FSA was responsible for obtaining a \nconciliation agreement or performing a preliminary inquiry and forward it to CR&SBUS was to \nforward the agreement to OCREA and recommend the discrimination complaint be closed.  If a \npreliminary inquiry was performed, CR&SBUS would analyze the information and determine if \ndiscrimination was found;  CR&SBUS was to forward the preliminary inquiry and its analysis to \nOCREA with its determination.  These procedures were never and are not now properly followed.\n31.  USDA has codified regulations, C.F.R., Part 15 – “Nondiscrimination” which states \nUSDA’s policy of nondiscrimination in federally assisted and conducted programs in compliance \nwith Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The regulations should have served as a basis for civil \nrights compliance and enforcement with respect to participants in FSA programs, however, \nDEFENDANTS  admits the regulations have long been and still are outdated and never reflected the \ndepartmental agencies, programs and law.  (emphasis supplied.) [OIG Report, p.5]\n32.  USDA Regulation 4330-1, which is over 11 years old, dated June 27, 1986, set the \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 22 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 23 of 62\ndepartmental policy for program civil rights compliance reviews, but does not provide policy and \nguidance for processing program discrimination complaints. [OIG Report, p.5] \n33.  On December 12, 1994, in a management alert to the ten Office of Civil Rights \nEnforcement, DEFENDANTS’ Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported problems with how \nUSDA received, processed, and resolved program discrimination complaints. OIG recommended \nthat “a departmental regulation be promulgated that sets forth the authorities of the Office of Civil \nRights Enforcement and that written procedures and controls be established governing the receipt, \nprocessing, and resolution of  program discrimination complaints within established timeframes”. \n[OIG Report, p.5] \n34.  The regulation was never published.\n35.  After years of abuse and benign neglect of African American farmers, OIG finally \nundertook an investigation and review, the results of which were released on February 27, 1997, of \nDEFENDANTS’ program discrimination complaints within FSA as well as 10 other agencies within \nUSDA.  OIG found,  inter alia, that the discrimination complaint process within USDA lacked \n“integrity,” and “accountability” was without a tracking system, was in “disorder”, did not resolve \ndiscrimination complaints, and had a massive backlog: \nThe program discrimination complaint process at FSA lacks integrity, \ndirection and accountability.  The staff responsible for processing \ndiscrimination complaints receives little guidance from management, \nfunctions in the absence of any current position descriptions or \ninternal  procedures,  and  is  beset  with  its  own  personnel  EEO \nproblems.  The staff also processes discrimination complaints without \na reliable tracking system to determine the status of the complaints, \nand, apparently, without deadlines to resolve the complaints.  The \nresulting climate of disorder has brought the complaint system within \nFSA  to  a  near  standstill.    Little  gets  accomplished  to  resolve \ndiscrimination complaints or to make program managers aware of \nalleged problems within their programs.  After developing our own \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 23 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 24 of 62\ndata base of unresolved cases, we determined that as of January 27, \n1997,  FSA  had  an  outstanding  backlog  of  241  complaints.” \n(Emphasis added) [OIG Report, p.6] \n \n36.  OIG found that the staff responsible for processing the discrimination complaints \nconsisted of two untrained and unqualified people: \nThe FSA staff responsible for processing discrimination complaints, \nthe  Civil Rights and Small Business Utilization Staff (CR&SBUS)” \nhas two full-time program specialists working to resolve program \ncomplaints.  These program specialists are supplemented by an \nadministrative assistant who provides secretarial support and two \nstaff assistants who maintain case files and the tracking system.  The \ntwo program specialists and the two staff assistants transferred to  \nFSA  from  the  civil  rights  staff  of  the  former  Farmer’s  Home \nAdministration (FmHA) during the Department’s reorganization in \nOctober 1995.  The staff assistants have been performing analyses of \nthe preliminary inquiries conducted on the complaints, although they \nare not trained or otherwise qualified to do so.  None of the former \nFmHA employees with CR&SBUS have position descriptions to \nreflect  their  current  duties  and  responsibilities,  and  none  have \nreceived performance appraisals for fiscal year 1996. \n \nOIG Report, p.6 (emphasis added). \n \n37.  OIG found a “massive backlog” of unprocessed FSA complaints. (OIG Report, p.6).  \nOIG found the FSA files “disorganized” and unaccountable: \n…CR&SBUS was unable to provide us with an accurate number of \noutstanding complaints or their status.  We reviewed the case files \nand found them generally disorganized.  It was difficult for us to \nreadily determine the date of the complaint, the reason it was brought, \nand the status of its resolution. \n \nOIG Report, p.7 (emphasis added). \n \n38.  OIG found hundreds of FSA cases unresolved: \n  Our review at the CR&SBUS and CREA disclosed that, \nbetween them, they had listed a total of 272 cases as being active.  \nThe oldest case listed dates back to 1986. *** After resolving all \nduplications and determining the actual status of the 272 cases, we \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 24 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 25 of 62\nfound that  FSA had 241 cases of program discrimination complaints \nthat had not been resolved.   \n \nOIG Report, p.7 (emphasis added). \n \n39.  OIG found repeated unaccountability and missing files: \n  During our reconciliation of the two agencies’ lists, we noted \nthat some cases were listed by one or the other agency but could not \nbe found in its filing system.  CR&SBUS listed 32 cases that we \ncould not find in its filing system, and CREA listed 28 cases that we \ncould not find in its filing system.  WE also noted that CR&SBUS \nlisted cases unknown to CREA.  CR&SBUS listed 19 cases that \nCREA did not list.” \n \nOIG Report, p.7. \n \n40.  OIG found there was no reliable method to the processing: \n  CREA had officially closed 30 of the 272 cases with findings \nof no discrimination.  CREA had also closed one case with a finding \nof discrimination, and the complainant was compensated.  The case \ninvolved the FSA disaster program, and the complainant received \nwhich were at first denied by FSA.  Four of the remaining 24 cases \nhad findings of discrimination as determined by CREA and are \npending resolution.  On of the four complainants has not responded to \nthe  Department’s  written  notice  regarding  filing  a  claim  for \ncompensation.  Offices of Operations officials are negotiating a \nsettlement with the remaining three complainants. \nOIG Report, pp. 7-8. \n \n41.  OIG found improperly closed files and improper reviews, and many files with no \ndocumentation. \n  We found that FSA improperly closed and forwarded 30 \ncomplaints to program managers, without notifying the Department \n(26  of  30  cases  were  closed  under  the  old  FmHA  agency \nmanagement).  The civil rights staff concluded without first receiving \nconcurrence from the Department that these cases were the result of \n“programmatic discrepancies” (i.e., agency error rather than civil \nrights  violations).    Without  departmental  concurrence  with  its \nfindings, the agency may not have addressed the legitimate cases of \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 25 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 26 of 62\ndiscrimination.    CREA  has  the  responsibility  to  make  final \ndetermination of  program discrimination.  FSA may recommend to  \nCREA that cases be closed, but it does not have the authority to close \nthese cases without concurrence from CREA.  For example, we noted \nthat in one instance FSA (the former FmHA) incorrectly concluded \nthat a case had only programmatic concerns and closed the case \nwithout forwarding it to the Department.  Only after a civil rights \nstaff member complained, did FSA process the case as a civil rights \ndiscrimination case.  The civil rights staff stated in a letter that the \nallegation of racial discrimination was overlooked.  The mix-up was \ndiscussed with the Department, which determined that the case \nshould be process by the civil rights staff.  For most of the remaining \ncases, we found no Department has reviewed these cases. \n \nOIG Report, p.8 (emphasis added). \n \n42.  OIG found 58% of the FSA civil rights complaint case files were over 1 year old and \nover 150 cases were almost two years old: \n. . . the average age of the 241 cases we consider open because they \nwere not officially closed by the Department. \n \n  No. of Cases      Program    Average Age\n \n151  Ag. Credit     \n        (Farm Loans)    703 Days \n  40        Disaster    485 Days \n  50        Others     482 Days \n \nof  the 241 open cases, 139 (58 percent) were known to be over 1 \nyear old.  Of the 241 cases, 129 (54 percent) are awaiting action in \nFSA; the remaining 112 cases, 46 percent) are in the hands of the \nCREA staff in USDA’s Office of Operations.  Sixty-five of the cases \nat FSA (50 percent) need a preliminary inquiry.  Some of these date \nback to 1993. \n \nOIG Report, p.8. \n \n43.  OIG found no system within FSA for reconciliation or tracking of civil rights \ncomplaint cases: \nCR&SBUS has no procedures in place to reconcile or track the status \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 26 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 27 of 62\nof  complaints  after  they  are  forwarded  to  CREA.    Therefore, \nCR&SBUS could not tell us the status of complaints at CREA.  As \nnoted above, both CR&SBUS and CREA had different numbers and \nwere not aware of all the outstanding complaints. \n \nOIG Report, p.8 (emphasis added). \n \n44.  OIG found no management oversight within FSA with respect to the handling of civil \nrights complaints: \n  CR&SBUS also does not prepare management reports to \ninform FSA program managers of alleged problems of discrimination \nwithin their programs.  Without this information, program managers \nmay not be aware of potential discrimination in the programs they are \nresponsible for administering. \n \nOIG Report, p.9. \n \n45.  With respect to DEFENDANTS’ Office of Operations, Civil Rights Enforcement and \nAdjudication (CREA), OIG found repeated inaccuracies and unaccountability: \n  . . .that the listing of outstanding cases provided by CREA \ncontained inaccurate information.  In some instances we were unable \nto locate the case files at CREA that were on its outstanding case list. \n Without reviewing the case files, were unable to verify the status of \nthe complaints.  Also, CREA and FSA had not reconciled their cases, \nand neither could inform us of the correct number of outstanding \ncases. \n \n  CREA does not have controls in place to monitor and track \ndiscrimination complaints.  When complaints are received they are \nlogged in, given a case number, and after the agency forwards the \npreliminary inquiry to CREA, the case is assigned to one of its seven \nprogram specialists to follow up on overdue responses from the \nagency.    We  have  found  that  CREA  is  not  following  up  on \ndiscrimination  cases  it  returned  to  FSA  for  conciliation  or \nperformance of a preliminary inquiry.  CREA advises the agency that \nit has 90 days to complete its review, but it does not follow up with \nthe agency to determine the status of the complaint. \n \nOIG Report, p.9. \n \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 27 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 28 of 62\n46.  OIG surveyed 10 other USDA program agencies in addition to FSA, to determine the \nprocedures used for processing program discrimination complaints and found the same problems.  \n[OIG Report, pp. 10-11] \n47.  OIG compiled a list of outstanding (“open) program discrimination complaints, as \nlate as 1996, within the Department, totaling 271. [OIG Report, at Attachment A] \n48.  At the same time that OIG released its report, a USDA Civil Rights Action Team \nreleased  a  report,  dated  February  1997,  condemning  DEFENDANTS’  lack  of  civil  rights \nenforcement and lack of accountability which, inter alia, were a cause of the drastic decline in the \nnumber of African American farmers.  (The Report is hereinafter referred to as “CRAT”): \n  According to the most recent Census of Agriculture, the \nnumber of all minority farms has fallen –from 950,000 in 1920 to \naround 60,000 in 1992.  For African Americans, the number fell from \n925,000, 14 percent of all farms in 1920, to only 18,000, 1 percent of \nall farms in 1920. \n \n[CRAT, p.14]. \n \n49.  CRAT  found  a  common  problem  involved  minority  farmers  applying  to \nDEFENDANTS loans:    \n  The minority or limited-resource farmer tries to apply for a \nfarm operating loan through the FSA county office well in advance of \nplanting season.  The FSA county office might claim to have no \napplications available and ask the farmer to return later.  Upon \nreturning,  the  farmer  might  receive  an  application  without  any \nassistance in completing it, then is asked repeatedly to correct \nmistakes or complete oversight in the loan application.  Often these \nrequests for correcting the application could be stretched for months, \nsince they would come if the minority farmer contacted the office to \ncheck on the loan processing.  By the time processing is completed, \neven when the loan is approved, planting season has already passed, \nand the farmer either has not been able to plant at all, or has obtained \nlimited credit on the strength of an expected FSA loan to plant a \nsmall crop, usually without the fertilizer and other supplies necessary \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 28 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 29 of 62\nfor the best yields.  The farmer’s profit is then reduced. \n \n [CRAT, p.15 (emphasis added)] \n \n50.  CRAT found systematic mistreatment of minority farmers: \n \n  If the farmer’s promised FSA loan finally does arrive, it may \nhave been arbitrarily reduced, leaving the farmer without enough \nmoney to repay suppliers and any mortgage or equipment debts.  In \nsome cases, the FSA loan never arrives, again leaving the farmer \nwithout any means to repay debts.  Further operating and disaster \nloans may be denied because of the farmer’s debt load, making it \nimpossible for the farmer to earn any money from the farm.  As an \nalternative,  the  local  FSA  official  might  offer  the  farmer  an \nopportunity to lease back the land with an option to buy it back later. \n The appraised value of the land is set very high, presumably to \nsupport the needed operating loans, but also making repurchase of the \nland beyond the limited-resource farmer’s means.  The land is lost \nfinally and sold at auction, where it is bought by someone else at half \nthe price being asked of the minority farmer.  Often, it is alleged that \nthe person was a friend or relative of one of the FSA county officials. \n \n [CRAT, p.16 (emphasis added)] \n \n51.  CRAT found insufficient oversight of farm credit to minorities: \n \n  Currently,  the  Farm  and  Foreign  Agricultural  Services  \n(FFAS) Mission Area, which manages the FSA program delivery \nsystem, provides ineffective oversight of the local delivery of farm \ncredit services. \n \n[CRAT, p.16 (emphasis added)] \n \n52.  CRAT found a lack of diversity in FSA program delivery structure: \n \n  Because of the ways in which State and county committees \nare chosen and county offices are staffed, FSA lacks diversity in its \nprogram  delivery  structure.    Federal  EEO  and  Affirmative \nEmployment laws and policies do not govern the FSA non-Federal \nworkforce except by agency regulation. \n \n[CRAT, p.18 (emphasis added)] \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 29 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 30 of 62\n \n53.  CRAT found a lack of minority employees in  FSA county offices: “A recent GAO \nstudy indicated that in the 101 counties with the largest concentration of minority farmers, one-\nquarter had no minority employees in their offices.” [CRAT, p. 18]. \n \n54.  CRAT found lower participation rates and lower approval rates for minorities in  FSA \nprograms: \n  Recent studies requested by Congress and FSA have found \nlower participation  and lower loan approval rates for minorities \ninmost FSA programs.  Participation rates in 1994 in programs of the \nformer Agricultural  Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), \nparticularly  commodity  programs  and  disaster  programs,  were \ndisproportionately low for all minorities.  The GAO found that \nbetween October 1, 1994 and March 31, 1996, 33 percent of minority \napplications but only 27 percent of non-minority application in the \nAgricultural Conservation Program (ACP) were disapproved.  During \nthe same period, 16 percent of minority but only 10 percent of non-\nminority loans in the direct loan program were disapproved. \n \n[CRAT, p.21 (emphasis added)] \n \n55.  For some states, the approval rates for farm loans were widely disparate: \n \n  For example, only 67 percent of African-American loans were \napproved in Louisiana, compared to 83 percent of non-minority \nloans.  Alabama showed a similar disparity  --only 78 percent of \nAfrican-American l0ans approved compared to 90 percent of non-\nminority loans. \n \n[CRAT, p.21 (emphasis added)] \n \n56.  CRAT found minorities endured longer loan processing times: \n  Again, however, some States showed consistently longer \nprocessing times for minorities.  In the Southeast, for example, in \nseveral States it took three times as long on average to process \nAfrican-American  loan  applications  as  it  did  non-minority \napplications.    Similar  disparities  between  non-minority  loan \nprocessing and American Indian loan processing appeared in records \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 30 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 31 of 62\nfor a number of States included in  FSA’s Northwest region. \n \n[CRAT, p.21]. \n \n57.  CRAT found discrimination complaints at USDA were often ignored: \n  Farmers who told the CRAT stories of discrimination and \nabuse by USDA agencies also described a complaints processing \nsystem  which,  if  anything,  often  makes  matters  worse.    They \ndescribed a bureaucratic nightmare where, even after they receive a \nfinding of discrimination, USDA refuses to pay damages.  They \ncharged USDA with forcing them into court to seek justice, rather \nthan working with them to redress acknowledged grievances.  They \npainfully described the toll these ongoing battles with USDA have \ntaken on their families, and on their health. \n \n[CRAT, p. 22-23]. \n \n58.  CRAT found decisions favoring farmers routinely not enforced by USDA: “However, \nmany farmers, especially small farmers, who have managed to appeal their cases to FSA charge that \neven when decisions are overturned, local offices often do not honor the decision.  They claim that \ndecisions favoring farmers are simply “not enforced”. \n59.  CRAT found a lack of USDA regulations for discrimination complaint processing: \n  Program discrimination complaints generally fall within two \ncategories: (1)  programs conducted directly by a USDA agency, such \nas USDA loan programs, and (2) federal assisted programs, where \nUSDA does not directly offer services to customers, but recipients of \nUSDA funds do.  The recipients must obey civil rights laws, and \nUSDA can be sued under such laws as Title VI, the Rehabilitation \nAct, IX, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and others.  CRAT \nmembers were informed by OGC that USDA presently  has no \npublished regulations with clear guidance on the process or time lines \ninvolved in program discrimination complaints. When a farmer does \nallege  discrimination,  “preliminary  investigations”  are  typically \nconducted by the agency that has been charged with violating her or \nhis right. \n \n[CRAT, p.24]. \n \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 31 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 32 of 62\n60.  CRAT found discrimination complaints often are not responded to by USDA: “. . . \nUSDA doesn’t respond even when they do file complaints.  In Tulsa, OK. , an advocate representing \nblack and American Indian farmers said, “we have filed 72 civil rights complaints.  Not one \ncomplaint has even been answered.” [CRAT, p.24] \n61.  CRAT found record-keeping on discrimination complaints “non-existent” and that a \nbacklog existed: \n  The CRAT was unable to gather historical data on program discrimination \ncomplaints at USDA because record keeping on these matters has been virtually \nnonexistent.  Complaints filed with the agencies are not necessarily reported to \nUSDA’s Civil Rights office.  Some figures are available however, for cases that were \nopen as of December 31, 1996.  The largest number of pending discrimination \ncomplaints, as comments at the listening sessions suggests, are concentrated in three \nagencies at USDA.  There were 205 cases pending, representing 42 percent of the \ntotal, against the FSS: 165, or 33.3 percent against the Rural Housing Service (RHS); \nand 62, or 12.5 percent against the Food and Consumer Services.  Sixty-three cases, \nor 12.7 percent of the total, were pending against other agencies.  The Department \nhad a total of 495 pending program discrimination complaints.  Approximately one-\nhalf of the  pending cases are two years old or older, verifying farmer’s contention \nthat  complaints are being processed slowly, if at all.  According to the Complaints \nProcessing Division at the Office of Operation (OO), which processes complaints \nthat make it to the Department level?  USDA averages about 200 new program \ndiscrimination complaints each year.  However, in fiscal year 1996, an average of \nonly 9 cases was closed per month, or 108 during the year – increasing a backlog of \nprogram complaints. \n \n[CRAT, pp. 24-25 (emphasis added)] \n \n62.  CRAT uncovered neglect of and bias against minorities by USDA, resulting in a loss \nof farmers’ land and income. \n  The recent Civil Rights listening session revealed a general \nperception  of  apathy,  neglect,  and  a  negative  bias  towards  all \nminorities on the part of most local USDA government officials \ndirectly  involved  in  decision  making for program delivery.  A \nreporter at the recent listening session in Tulsa, Oklahoma observed \nthat minority farmers are not sure which condition “was worse – \nbeing ignored by the USDA and missing potential opportunities or \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 32 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 33 of 62\ngetting involved with its programs and facing a litany of abuses.  \nMinority farmers have lost significant amounts of land and potential \nfarm income as a result discrimination of FSA programs and the \nprograms of its predecessor agencies, ASCS and FmHA.  Socially \ndisadvantaged  and  minority  farmers  said  USDA  is  part  of  a \nconspiracy to take their land and look to USDA for some kind of \ncompensation for their losses. \n \n[CRAT, p. 30]. \n \n63.  CRAT found USDA the fifth worst (of 56 government agencies) in  hiring minorities: \n  According to the US Department of Labor, between 1990 and \n2000, women, minorities, and immigrants will account for 80 percent \nof the United States labor force growth.  The “Framework for \nChange: Work Force Diversity and Delivery of Programs,” a USDA \nreport released in 1990, found that USDA had a need to remedy \nunder-representation in its workforce by providing equal employment \nand promotion opportunities for all employees.  When this statement \nwas made, USDA ranked 52 out of 56 Federal agencies in the \nemployment of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. \n \n[CRAT, p.33]. \n \n64.  CRAT found the lack of diversity at USDA adversely affects program delivery to \nminorities:   “USDA’s workforce does not reflect the diversity of its customer base.  The lack of \ndiversity in field offices adversely affects program delivery to minority and women customers of \nUSDA.” [CRAT, p.45] \n65.  CRAT found a lack of resources at USDA to ensure fair and equitable (non-\ndiscriminatory ) program delivery to farmers: \n  The Assistant Secretary for Administration is USDA’s senior \nofficial responsible for civil rights.  Although that position has the \nresponsibility for civil rights policy and compliances, it does not have \nthe authority or resources necessary to ensure that programs are \ndelivered and employees are treated fairly and equitably. \n \n[CRAT, p.46]. \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 33 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 34 of 62\n \n66.  CRAT found enforcement of civil rights at USDA in program delivery lacking: \n  Another  problem  with  enforcing  civil  rights  in  program \ndelivery is fragmentation.  Agency civil rights directors have a \nnumber of responsibilities.  For example, USDA agencies each \nperform  come  complaint  processing  functions.    However,  the \nCommission  noted  that  the  respective  roles  of  OCRE  and  the \nagencies were not clearly defined.  The Commission also found that \nOCRE was providing technical assistance to agencies on civil rights \nstatutes, not proactively, but only when requested. \n \n[CRAT, p.51] \n \n67.  CRAT found a lack of civil rights specialists and knowledge for program-related civil \nrights issues at USDA: \n  The Civil Rights Commission’s report on the lack of Title VI \nenforcement also pointed to USDA’s lack of civil rights specialists in \nprogram-related civil rights issues.  Many of the Department’s civil \nrights  resources  are  devoted  to  processing  of  employment \ndiscrimination complaints.  Of the current staff in the Department’s \ntwo civil rights offices, two-thirds work on EEO complaints.  That \nmeans only a small percentage of USDA’s  civil rights staff works on \ncivil rights issues relating to program delivery.  According to the \nCommission,  the  1994  civil  rights  reorganization  was  deficient \nbecause OCRE did not separate internal and external civil rights \nissues into separate offices.  The Commission predicted that “a \nprobable consequence is that USDA’s Title VI enforcement program \nmay suffer as OCRE responds to pressures to improve USDA’s \ninternal civil rights program.”  It recommended that USDA establish \n“two separate units, with different supervisory staff,” one for internal \nand one for external civil rights issues. \n \n[CRAT, p.54] \n \n68.  CRAT found DEFENDANTS’ counsel hostile to civil rights, if not racist: \n  The perception that the Office of the General Counsel [at \nUSDA] is hostile to civil rights has been discussed earlier in this \nreport.  OGC’s legal positions on civil rights issues are perceived as \ninsensitive at the least, and racist at worst.  Correcting this problem is \ncritical to the success of USDA’s civil rights program. \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 34 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 35 of 62\n \n[CRAT, p.55] \n \n69.  CRAT  found DEFENDANTS’ counsel often have no civil rights experience or \neducation: \n  However, the CRAT has found that attorneys who practice \ncivil  rights  law  at  [USDA’s]  OGC  are  not  required  to  have \nspecialized experience or education in civil rights when they are \nhired.  They acquire their civil rights experience on the job.  In \naddition, most of OGC’s lawyers working on civil rights issues work \non non-civil rights issues as well. \n \n[CRAT, p.55] \n \n70.  In sum, CRAT concluded that DEFENDANTS does not support or enforce civil \nrights: \n  USDA does not have the structure in place to support an \neffective  civil  rights  program.    The  Assistant  Secretary  for \nAdministration lacks authority and resources essential to ensure \naccountability among senior management ranks.  There has been \ninstability and lack of skilled leadership at the position of USDA \nDirector of Civil Rights.  Dividing up the Department’s Civil Rights \noffice between policy and complaints  has further exacerbated the \nproblem.  The division of responsibility for civil rights among \ndifferent  USDA  offices  and  agencies  has  left  confusion  over \nenforcement  responsibilities.    Finally,    OGC  is  perceived  as \nunsupportive of civil rights. \n \n[CRAT, p. 56] \n \n71.  On September 29, 1997, USDA’s Office of Inspector General issued Phase II of the \nOIG Report on Civil Rights Issues, entitled “Minority Participation In Farm Service Agency’s Farm \nLoan Programs – Phase II” (hereafter “OIG Report Phase II”) which found, inter alia that (a) \nDEFENDANTS has resolved only 32 of the 241 outstanding discrimination complaints reported in \nthe OIG Report (back in February, 1997) and (b) that the backlog of discrimination complaints had \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 35 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 36 of 62\nincreased from 241 to 474 for FSA and from 530 to 984 for all of USDA. \n72.  On September 30, 1998, the USDA’s Office of Inspector General released its “Report \nto the Secretary on Civil Rights Issues – Phase V” [hereinafter “OIG Report V”], which supplements \nPLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS claims and supporting \nmaterials in this lawsuit and in the above pending motions.  In particular, OIG Report V states, inter \nalia:\ni.  “We  found  that  the  Department  [USDA],  t  through  CR \n(Office of Civil Rights], has not made significant progress in \nreducing the complaints backlog.  Whereas the backlog stood \nat 1,088 complaints on November 1, 1997, it still remains at \n616 complaints as of September 11, 1998.”  OIG Report V, \ncover letter to the Secretary. \n \nii.  The backlog is not being resolved at a faster rate because CR \nitself has not attained the efficiency it needs to systematically \nreduce the caseload.  Few of the deficiencies we noted in our \nprevious reviews have been corrected.  The office is still in \ndisarray, providing no decisive leadership and making little \nattempt to correct the mistakes of the past.  We noted with \nconsiderable concern that after 20 months,  CR has made \nvirtually no progress implementing the corrective actions we \nthought essential to the viability of its operations. OIG Report \nV at I (emphasis added). \n \niii.  Most conspicuous among the uncorrected problems is the \ncontinuing disorder within CR.  The database CR uses to \nreport the status of cases is unreliable and full of error, and \nthe files it keeps to store needed documentation are slovenly \nand unmanaged.  Forty complaint files could not be found, \nand another 130 complaints that were listed in USDA agency \nfiles were not recorded in  CR’s data base.  Management \ncontrols were so poor that we could not render an opinion on \nthe quality of CR’s investigations and adjudications.”  OIG \nReport V at iii (emphasis added). \n \niv.  “Of equal significance is the absence of written policy and \nprocedures.” OIG Report V at iii. \n \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 36 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 37 of 62\nv.  “The absence of formal procedures and accurate records \nraises  questions  about  due  care  within  the  complaints \nresolution process.  We found critical quality control steps \nmissing at every stage of the process.  Staff members with \nlittle training and less experience were put to judging matters \nthat carry serious legal and moral implications.  Many of \nCR’s  adjudicators,  who  must  determine  whether \ndiscrimination occurred, were student interns.  Legal staff \nmembers with the Office of  General Counsel (PGC), who \nreview CR’s decisions for legal sufficiency,  have had to \nreturn  over  half  of  them  because  they  were  based  on \nincomplete  data  or  faulty  analysis.    We  noted  that  a \ndisproportionately  large  percent  of  the  616  cases  of \nunresolved backlog had bottlenecked in the adjudication \nunit.”  OIG Report V at iii (emphasis added). \n \n73.  In sum, DEFENDANTS’ willful disregard of, and failure to properly investigate, \nAfrican-American discrimination complaints began with the disbanding of civil rights enforcement \nfunctions back in 1983, until February 1997 when the current administration reorganized and \nreestablished the enforcement staff of the civil rights office, and since February, 1987, has gotten \nworse, as evidenced by the massive increase of backlogged, unresolved cases and overall disarray in \nthe USDA Office of Civil Rights as reported in the most recent OIG Report.  \nB.  THE PIGFORD DISASTER RELEVANT TO BFAA, INC. CLASS  \n74.  The Pigford lawsuit is “a disaster,” opined Mr. Vernon Parker, Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Rights.  Richmond Times Dispatch. \n75.  In the Pigford lawsuit Memorandum and Order approving the Consent Decree, the \nCourt opined regarding the Consent Decree’s flaws and weaknesses by asserting that the \nagreement was “moot on forward looking injunctive relief” and the restructuring of the antiquated \ncounty committee system that led to the gross deprivation of rights and discrimination against the \nPigford class members.               .  \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 37 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 38 of 62\n76.  The Environmental Working Group, a public interest group which studies US \nAgriculture policy, released a report,  “Obstruction of Justice: USDA Undermines Historic Civil \nRights Settlement for Black Farmers”,July 26, 2004, essentially concluding that the Pigford \nlawsuit has been rendered an abject failure. The EWG in describing the Pigford failures stated as \nfollows: \nA.  Deadline barred 64,000 claims, despite lack of notice. The \nsettlement-funded arbitrator rejected 64,000 farmers who \ncame forward with claims during the late claims process \nestablished  by  the  court.  The  late  claims  process  was \nnecessary  because  the  farmers'  attorneys,  whose \nrepresentation was characterized by the court as \"bordering \non legal malpractice,\" failed to notify the farmers of the \noriginal  deadline  for  application.  The  settlement-funded \narbitrator rejected these 64,000 farmers simply on the basis of \ntheir tardiness for the original deadline, even though all \n64,000  rejected  claims  were  submitted  within  the  court \nestablished late claims period. An additional 7,800 farmers \nfailed to file before the late claims deadline expired and were \nalso denied entry to the class. \nB.  Nearly  nine  out  of  ten  denied  restitution.    USDA  \naggressively fought claims by African American farmers, \ncontracting with United States Department of Justice lawyers \nwho  spent  at  least  56,000  staff  hours  and  $12  million \ncontesting individual farmer claims for discrimination. \n77.  The Black Farmers’ saga and the Pigford’s “disaster” have been chronicled in news \ncoverage, print and electronic, all over the country since the release of the EWG Report.

CLASS  WERE  DAMAGED;  WHAT \nDEFENDANTS DID IN RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION \nAND GOVERNMENT REPORTS OF INEFFICIENCY   \n \n78.  Unbeknownst to BFAA, Inc., prospective class representatives and putative class \nmembers and despite the 1977 Pigford law suit and the resulting 1999 Consent Decree, the \nDefendants continued discriminating, in violation of the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, ECOA \nand the APA, against the proposed class members, individually and collectively, and operating \nOCREA in a manner, if not de jure, but indisputably de facto, closely consistent with the goals of \nthe Reagan Administration in shutting down the OCREA (Office of Civil Rights [“OCR”] ) in 1983. \n79.  In 1996, and after years of abuse and complaints, the OIG initiated a series of civil rights \ncompliance, employee and programmatic investigations4, some of which are above delineated.  \nSubsequent to Pigford, the OIG continued its annual investigations up to and including the year 2000 \nat which time the OIG investigations and reports abruptly ceased.5\n80.  On information and belief, the Bush Administration, by and through DEFENDANTS, \nindividually and collectively, directed and or caused OCR, during and subsequent to the Pigford \nlawsuit  and  the  resulting  Consent  Decree,  to  delay  and  frustrate  program  and  employee \ndiscrimination investigations and to not issue affirmative findings of discrimination pursuant to 7 \nCFR §§ 2.28, 15.52, et. seq. and related Secretarial Delegations of Authority to the Assistant \n                                                 \n4 The Office of Civil Rights employee and program administrative investigative processes are under the \nauspices of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Vernon Parker, a Defendant herein.   There is no distinction in \nterms of policy or personnel relative to employee and program complaints.  Defendants would argue contrary to this \nposition. Succinctly put, their argument presents a distinction without a difference.  \n \n5 On information and belief, the USDA OIG initiated two new discrimination review reports, entitled, \nEvaluation of the Office of Civil Rights’ Efforts to Implement at Implementation of recommendations in seven \nprevious OIG Investigations.

United States Civil Rights Commission (“USCCR”) 2003 Report, chronicles the \nUSDA’s continuous, intentional, insidious institutional racism, and its benign neglect of this \ncountry’s civil rights laws and this county’s efforts to rid this society of such mindless racial animus \nand hatred.  The report states, in part, as follows: \nDepartment of Agriculture \nThe Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers billions of \ndollars in federally assisted programs that reach almost every citizen \nin  the  United  States.  Civil  rights  offices  and  staff  are  situated \nthroughout the Department… The Department has one of the most \ncomplex  and  decentralized  civil  rights  structures  in  the  federal \ngovernment. USDA has done little to coordinate all of its civil rights \nresponsibilities  effectively.  The  Department’s  agencies  have \nundergone  reorganizations,  name  changes,  and  realignments; \nhowever with inconsistent result.  Overall, the Department has not \nmade  significant  changes  to  address  the  Commission’s  1996 \nrecommendations or improve civil rights enforcement. \n \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Office of Civil Rights Evaluation, Ten-Year Check-up: Have \nFederal Agencies Responded to Civil Rights Recommendations?, Volume lll: An Evaluation of the \nDepartments Of Agriculture. . .

In its evaluation of the USDA’s Civil Rights Programs, The USCCR concludes, in \npart, as follows: \n. . . USDA/OCR could not distinguish its Title VI (Title VII or \nECOA) workload or expenditures from those of the activities that \nother civil rights statues required.  OCR could not plan reasonable \ngoals for Title VI (Title VII or ECOA) enforcement. . . In addition \nOCR’s guidance is still confusing. . .USDA/OCR, FSA had not made \nmany improvements or changes since the Commission evaluated \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 42 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 43 of 62\nwhat was the FmHA (FSA) in 1996. . . FSA/OCR does not have the \nability to submit and control its own budget. . .In 1996, the agency \nsubmitted Civil Rights Implementation Plans to DOJ, but today the \nagency is not required to submit plans because it conducts few if any \npre-award and post-award reviews and has no record of legal and \nadministrative activity. . . despite its legal, administrative and \nregulatory authority and mandate to so do.  \n \nId. at 34, 52 (emphasis added). \n84.  The GAO has been just as critical of the USDA’s civil rights programs and refusal to \nadequately provide due process and equal protection to program participants, prospective class \nmembers, and employees as has other internal and external federal agencies.  The GAO stated:          \n                         \nPursuant to a congressional request, GAO discussed the Department \nof Agriculture's (USDA) efforts to process discrimination complaints, \nfocusing on the: \n(1)  timeliness and ability of USDA's Office of Civil Rights \n(OCR) to process employment discrimination complaints; and  \n(2)  reasons  for  delays  in  the  implementing  GAO's  previous \nrecommendations. \n \nGAO noted that: \n(1)  a number of long-standing problems are impending USDA's \nefforts to improve delays in its processing of discrimination \ncomplaints within its Civil Rights Program, including: \n  (a) continuing management turnover and reorganizations in \nUSDA's OCR; \n  (b)  inadequate staff and managerial expertise; \n  (c)  a lack of clear, up-to-date guidance and procedures; \nand  \n  (d)  poor working relationships and communication within \nOCR and between the office and other USDA entities;  \n \n(2)  USDA is not consistently using alternative dispute resolution \ntechniques, such as mediation, to address workplace and other \ndisputes before they become formal complaints; \n(3)  USDA  has  drafted  a  long-term  improvement  plan  to \nsystematically address problems in the program which they \nplan to implement in October 2000; \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 43 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 44 of 62\n(4)  to address personnel problems in OCR, USDA plans to: \ndevelop an (a) assessment of the skills needed for OCR; (b) \nimplement training programs to properly educate employees; \nand  (c)  to  conduct  performance  evaluations  that  would \nprovide the basis for taking appropriate action in regard to \nemployees who are not performing at acceptable levels; \n(5)  OCR is in the process of issuing two operations manuals and \nseveral  standard  operating  procedures  for  implementing \nregulations addressing complaint processing; \n(6)  OCR's implementation of the program complaint process was \nhindered by agencies' disagreement with OCR about their role \nin the program complaint process and by inadequate OCR \nguidance; \n(7)  OCR also has difficulties in developing effective working \nrelationships with the Office of General Counsel, which \nfurther  lead  to  inefficiencies  and  delays  in  processing \ncomplaints; \n(8)  inadequate communication within OCR also contributed to \nlow morale and productivity; \n(9)  according to USDA's Assistant Secretary for Administration, \nOCR meets regularly with a committee of agency civil rights \ndirectors; \n(10)  GAO's 1999 report on this matter found that USDA's Civil \nRights Program had a long way to go before it achieved the \nSecretary's stated goal of making USDA the civil rights \nleader in the federal government; \n(11)  plans to address civil rights complaints will require long-term \nimplementation, including funding for hiring and training \npersonnel; and \n(12)  it appears as if the Secretary's goal, at least in the short term, \nremains elusive. \n \nU.S. Department of Agriculture: Problems in Processing Discrimination Complaints (Testimony, \n09/12/2000, GAO/T-RCED-00-286). \n85.  In reporting to the Secretary on the implementation of program administrative \nsettlement agreements resulting from USDA’s admitted discrimination and USDA’s refusal to \ndiscipline the offending government officials, Inspector General Roger C. Viadero wrote the \nfollowing:                                             \n  . . . Even though there was a high probability that discrimination did \nindeed occur. . . no disciplinary action has been taken against any \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 44 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 45 of 62\ndiscriminating official.  CR (Office of Civil Rights, OCR) has \nprovided agencies no formal guidance on how to proceed. . . We have \nconsistently urged CR to provide guidance on all stages of the \ncomplaint resolution process. . . CR remained unaware of the number \nand status of all agreements. CR was not tracking the implementation \nof the agreements, and it offered no formal guidance on cases that \nhad  been  referred  for  disciplinary  action.  We  found  that  no \ndisciplinary actions had been taken in any of the cases involving \nproven or probable discrimination . . . \n     \nUnited States Department of Agriculture, Report to the Secretary 0f Agriculture On Civil Rights \nIssues – Phase IV: Evaluation of the Office of Civil Rights’ Efforts to Implement Civil Rights \nSettlements, Office of Inspector General, Evaluation Report No. 60801-2-Hq, March 1999;  pp. 2, i \n(Executive Summary)             \n86.  In his Phase VII Report to the Secretary on Civil Rights Issues, USDA Inspector \nGeneral Roger V. Viadero wrote: \n. . . Although this is the first time we evaluated CR’s management of \nEEO                 complaints, it represents our seventh attempt to \nprovide CR with constructive ways to overcome its inefficiencies.  \nBased on our current review of CR’s EEO complaint processing and \nour observations of the EEO operating environment at CR, we cannot \nreport encouraging news . . . CR is as inefficient in processing EEO \ncomplaints as past reviews have shown it to be in processing \nprogram complaints (Complaints of Class Members). . .

The Inspector General further concluded, among other detailed conclusions, that (a) \nthe OCR case files “were in chaos”  (b) “case files were not maintained with any decree of order, (c) \n“documents were either improperly filed or missing, and (d) files themselves were disordered and \nsometimes difficult to locate.”   \n88.  To  illustrate  the  callous  disregard  for  the  rights  of  all  complainants  by  the \nDefendants, the Inspector General included the following visuals in his report: \n                                                                                                                                                             \n8 On information and belief, the USDA OIG initiated two new discrimination review reports, entitled  \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 46 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 47 of 62\n \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 47 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 48 of 62\n     \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 48 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 49 of 62\nId. at 10,11 (FN9). \n89.  In yet another scathing report to the Secretary, of USDA’s intentionally non-\nresponsive and near dormant civil rights program and in the subtle furtherance of program \ndiscrimination resulting in denial of due process and equal protection of the laws and violation of the \nAPA and ECOA, against this class, Inspector General Roger C. Viadero, wrote \n(a)   .  .  .  This  is  our  seventh  attempt  to  provide  CR  with \nconstructive ways to   overcome its’ inefficiencies. . . we cannot \nreport encouraging news. . . We found that CR continues to be \ninefficient  in  processing  program  (class  member)  complaints. \nProgram complainants must wait, on average, 122 days before they \nare even notified by CR that it intends to investigate their complaints. \nThe processing time reported to you do not reflect the actual average \ntimes and do not provide meaningful comparisons on which to base \nthe notion of progress; and  \n \n(b)   . . .  CR did not reengineer its complaints resolution process.  \nAlthough CR officials had previously agreed that the system they \nused to process complaints was neither effective or efficient and \nalthough we recommended a major transformation of this system, no \nsignificant changes in how complaints are processed has been \nmade.  As a result, we cannot conclude that all complaints are being \nprocessed with due care. . . CR’s data base and file room remain \npoorly managed. . .

PURPOSE OF THE EQUAL CREDIT & OPPORTUNITY ACT \n92.  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), as amended in 1976, is a detailed and \nexhaustive legislative directive unequivocal in its statutory intent to stamp out discrimination by any \nlender, anywhere, whether they be a private, public, governmental or quasi-governmental entity. \n93.  ECOA states, inter alia : \nIt shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any \napplicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction – (1) on \nthe basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, \nor age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);…  \n \n15 U.S.C. §1691 (a)(1). ECOA provides for monetary relief to both individuals and \nclass members who are damaged by creditors who violate the statute: \nAny creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed \nunder this subchapter shall be liable to the aggrieved applicant for \nany actual damages sustained by such applicant acting either in an \nindividual capacity or as a member of a class. \n \n15 U.S.C. §1691e(a). Thirdly, district courts are invested with the authority to \nprovide equitable and declaratory relief: \nUpon application by an aggrieved applicant, the appropriate United \nStates district court or any other court of competent jurisdiction may \ngrant such equitable and declaratory relief as is necessary to enforce \nthe requirements imposed under this subchapter. \n \n15 U.S.C. §1691e(c) (emphasis added).  Fourthly, the prevailing party can recover \ncosts and reasonable attorney’s fees: \nIn the case of any successful action under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of \nthis  section,  the  cost  of  the  action,  together  with  a  reasonable \nattorney’s fee as determined by the court, shall be added to any \ndamages awarded by the court under such subsection.  \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 52 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 53 of 62\n \n15 U.S.C. §1691e (d) (emphasis added). \n \n94.  In sum, this court has jurisdiction to grant actual damages, equitable and declaratory \nrelief, costs and attorneys fees, and ECOA contains a waiver of United States sovereign immunity. \n95.  When the class members filed discrimination complaints, they fell four-square under \nthe umbrella of ECOA.  It is PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK \nFARMERS’ belief that ninety-five percent of class members filed complaints of discrimination with \nrespect to the USDA loan application process.  Only five percent have claims for denial of disaster \napplications. \n96.  DEFENDANTS do not dispute the waiver of sovereign immunity under ECOA.    \nPlaintiffs assert that there is no just reason for denying the remaining five percent of PLAINTIFFS \nAND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS’ relief for complaints of discrimination \ninvolving disaster benefits.  While ECOA covers farm “credit” programs, but not disaster programs, \nthe APA provides an avenue of relief for Black farmers who have been denied equal access to \ndisaster programs and, subsequently, due process of law in challenging the implementation of that \nprogram.  The implementation of USDA’s credit programs and other programs were closely \nintertwined and the violation of PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK \nFARMERS’ rights equally egregious in both areas.  Racial discrimination ran rampant under both \nprograms, and neither offered Black farmers an opportunity to appeal to a civil rights enforcement \nbody to obtain relief.  Further, in many instances, the calculation of loans under the credit program \nand payments or benefits under the other programs were interdependent.  For example, the amount \nof program benefits or program allotments that a farmer could receive for the crop of a commodity \n(such as cotton, corn, wheat, rice, peanuts, or tobacco) in a year required a review of his or her \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 53 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 54 of 62\nfarming history, which, in turn, was directly related to the yield per acre the farmer cultivated, which \nwas dependent on the amount of operating credit made available to the farmer. \n97.  Class members are seeking redress for the denial of due process to the members of \nthe class for the discriminatory implementation of these interconnected farm programs and for the \nDEFENDANTS’ failure regarding these programs to provide sufficient civil rights investigation and \nenforcement. \nB.  ECOA STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS WAIVED \n98.  On October 21, 1998, the President signed into law the Omnibus Consolidated \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999, P.L. 105-___.  This legislation contains the following \nprovisions: \nSec. 741.  Waiver of Statute of Limitations. \na.  To the extent permitted by the Constitution, any civil action \nto obtain relief with respect to the discrimination alleged in an \neligible complaint, if commenced not later than 2 years after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act, shall not be barred by \nany statute of limitations. \n \nb.  The complainant may, in lieu of filing a civil action, seek a \ndetermination on the merits of the eligible complaint by the \nDepartment of Agriculture if such complaint was filed not \nlater than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.  The \nDepartment of Agriculture shall– \n  i.  provide the complainant an opportunity for a hearing \non the record before making that determination; \n  ii.  award  the  complainant  such  relief  as  would  be \nafforded under the applicable statute from which the \neligible complaint arose notwithstanding any statute of \nlimitations; and \n  iii.  to the maximum extent practicable within 180 days \nafter the date a determination of an eligible complaint \nis  sought  under  this  subsection  conduct  an \ninvestigation,  issue  a  written  determination  and \npropose  a  resolution  in  accordance  with  this \nsubsection. \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 54 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 55 of 62\n \n  c.  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if an eligible claim \nis denied administratively, the claimant shall have at least 180 \ndays to commence a cause of action in a Federal Court of \ncompetent jurisdiction seeking a review of such denial. \n \nd.  The United States Court of Federal Claims and the United \nStates District Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction \nover– \n  i.  any cause of action arising out of a complaint with \nrespect to which this section waives the statute of \nlimitations; and \n  ii.  any civil action for judicial review of a determination \nin an administrative proceeding  in the Department of \nAgriculture under this section. \n \ne.  As used in this section, the term “eligible complaint” means a \nnon-employment related complaint that was filed with the \nDepartment of Agriculture before July 1, 1997 and alleges \ndiscrimination at any time during the period beginning on \nJanuary 1, 1981 and ending December 31, 1996– \n \ni.  in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 \nU.S.C. 1691 et seq.) in administering– \n    1.  a  farm  ownership,  farm  operating,  or \nemergency loan funded from the Agriculture \nCredit Insurance Program Account; or \n    2.  a housing program established under title V of \nthe Housing Act of 1949; or \n \n  ii.  in the administration of a commodity program or \ndisaster assistance program. \n \nf.  This section shall apply in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. \n \ng.  The standard of review for judicial review of an agency \naction with respect to an eligible complaint is de novo review. \nChapter 5 of title 5 of the United States Code shall apply with \nrespect to an agency action under this section with respect to \nan eligible complaint, without regard to section 554(a)(1) of \nthat title. \n \n \nIX. \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 55 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 56 of 62\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  \n \n99.

P. 23, and LCvR 23.1(a)(2) , the proposed class \ndefinition is as follows: \n  All African American, BLACK farmers who (1) farmed or \nattempted farm between January 1, 1997 and August 30, 2004; \nand (2) applied, or would have applied but for the rampant and \novert  USDA  discrimination,  during  that  time  period,  for \nparticipation in a federal farm program with USDA, and as a \ndirect result of a determination by USDA in response to said \napplication, believed that they were discriminated against on the \nbasis  of  race,  Black,  and  those  who  may  have  filed  a \ndiscrimination complaint in that period of time.   \n \n100.  The potential number of  Class Members is estimated to be between 5,000 and with \nNotice to putative class members the final number should or may result in somewhere between \n25,000 or more Class Members.11  With respect to the Class Members, the allegations are similar, if \nnot identical, to the allegations and causes of actions of the  Class representatives.  Simply put, each \nand every plaintiff and class representative was denied a loan or program benefit, such as a farm \nownership, farm operating or disaster loan, by DEFENDANTS, or was granted a loan or program \nbenefit on terms different than that of white farmers; said plaintiffs complained on grounds of \ndiscrimination; said discrimination complaint was never resolved pursuant to the law; and all of \nthese events occurred during the period 1997-2004. \n101.  The  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  all  class  members  is  based  on \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, US Const., 15 U.S.C. §1691, et seq.  42 U.S.C. §§  1985, 7 CFR  \n§§ 2,28, 15.52, et. seq. and 5 U.S.C. § 706 and the DEFENDANTS’ violations thereof, all to the \n                                                 \n11 The status of the approximate 70,000 late filer class members in the Pigford Class Action \nlawsuit remains to be determined by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The \nBFAA, Inc. class makes no assertion that the late filers should be or are included in their ranks.  \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 56 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 57 of 62\ndetriment of and damages to the entire class.  \n102.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, individually and collectively, arbitrarily \nand capriciously dismissed, on or about August 15, 2003, without acceptance or investigation, the \nprogram discrimination complaints of approximately 3000 class members, all in the furtherance of \nits goal to discriminate against Black farmers and to provide preferential treatment to white farmers. \n The DEFENDANTS were perpetrated with the express intent to injure Black Farmers and to deny \nBlack Farmers their rights, all to the class members’ detriment. \n  103.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, each with the other, conspired, within \nthe USDA’s Administrative Civil Rights Process, to deprive Class Members their civil rights as is \npartially evidenced by the public statements of former Assistant Secretary for Administration12 Lou \nGallegos contained in an article entitled, “Virginia Bias Case Triggers Debate”. Assistant Secretary \nGallegos’ instructive statement  follows:      \n   There’s  nothing  more  demeaning  to  humanity  than \ndiscrimination especially when it is done by your own \ngovernment . . . Gallegos said the Department’s Office of \nGeneral Counsel  pushed him to order a detailed review of \nthe (Warren) decision - in effect, an appeal.  He said that \nthe lawyers tried to offer evidence that had not been a \npart of the Court  record . . . I thought that was unseemly \n. . . The payout ($6.6 million) >was the cost of not acting \nwhen they (USDA) should have in a meaningful way.    \n \nRichmond Times Dispatch, April 3, 2003 (emphasis added).   \n104.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, each with the other, conspired to deprive \n                                                 \n \n12 The Assistant Secretary for Administration had the delegated and regulatory authority to accept \nemployee and program complaints of discrimination and to resolve such complaints for payment of \ncompensatory damages prior to the transfer of those authorities to the newly created Assistant Secretary for \nCivil Rights political position.  Gallegos resigned under pressure and dubious circumstances upon his refusal \nto follow the dictates of the OGC and the DEFENDANT SECRETARY who insisted that he reverse the ALJ 6.6 \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 57 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 58 of 62\nclass members their civil rights by secretly installing DEFENDANT TRUE, former Deputy \nAssociate General Counsel for Civil Rights, current Director of the Office of Civil Rights, when they \nhad actual notice and knew or should have known that to do so would present, and did present, a \nirrefutable conflict of interest and would violate, and did violate, the federal disciplinary rules for \nlawyers and the Canon of Ethics.  The DEFENDANTS did so with the express intent of placing an \nattorney responsible for legal defense of the DEFENDANTS in civil rights administrative claims, all \nof which she is imputed to have knowledge of by virtue of her former position, into the Directorship \nof the Office of Civil Rights where she now has the responsibility to accept, investigate and settle, if \ndiscrimination affirmed, class members’ administrative discrimination claims, all in violation of law \nand regulations and to the detriment of all class members.   \n105.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, each with the other, conspired to deprive \nBFAA, Inc. and Pigford late filer class members their civil rights by obstructing justice as stated in \nthe EWG report, “Obstruction of Justice: USDA Undermines Historic Civil Rights Settlement for \nBlack Farmers” which is incorporated herein as if fully stated verbatim.       \n106.  The  foregoing  allegations  are  typical  as  to  all  Class  Members.    The  Class \nRepresentatives, for themselves and members of the Class will present a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination showing (1)DEFENDANTS’ awarding of credit and farm program participation to \nwhites was a pattern different than for the Class members (2)(a) the Class Members were qualified \nfor credit, 2(b) applied for credit and (2(b) were denied credit while white farmers received credit \nwhether qualified or not, and (3) a willful failure of DEFENDANTS to accept complaints of \ndiscrimination, to properly investigate the discrimination complaints filed by PLAINTIFFS AND \n                                                                                                                                                             \nmillion dollar Warren award issued against the DEFENDANTS.   \n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 58 OF 62 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 1   Filed 09/09/04   Page 59 of 62\nALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS and members of the Class, and a willful, \ncollusive  failure  to  compensate  Black  Farmers  who  had  been  discriminated  against  by  the \nDEFENDANTS, individually and collectively. \nX. \nCAUSES OF ACTION  \n \nA.

The DEFENDANTS, each with the other, have intentionally denied the Class \nRepresentatives and Members the due process of and equal protection of the laws by their willful \nconduct and callous disregard for the Class Representatives’ civil rights and liberties, all to the \ndetriment of and damages to the plaintiffs.  \nB.

COUNT IV – CONTINUOUS AND UNABATED VIOLATIONS OF THE ECOA \n \n115.  Class representatives, on behalf of themselves and all Class members similarly \nsituated, re-allege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n116.

Civil Rights are those rights that the government is obligated to \nprotect between parties.  Civil Liberties are those same exact rights but the government is prohibited from \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 2 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 28 of 82\npursuit of life, liberty, happiness and ownership of property. Even more, the United States \ngovernment and its USDA officials, the DEFENDANTS herein, have engaged and continue to \nengage in an institutional and insidious racism and conspiracy to interfere with the Black American \nFarmers’ civil rights and liberties. \n2.  To this day, the promise remains elusive for all Black Americans, Black American \nFarmers and their heirs, merely because of their race, Black.   \n3.  The racial hatred and animus perpetrated by the USDA, dubbed, “The Last \nPlantation,” persist like a plague. The DEFENDANTS, through intention, deceit, passivity, inaction \nand benign neglect, have knowingly allowed and even encouraged top government administrators \nand lawyers as well as local federal Farm Service Agency officials across this land to trample on the \ncivil rights of the Class Representatives and to make a mockery of our precepts of freedom. \nDEFENDANTS, individually and jointly, knew or should have known that these blatant violations \nof law run rampant throughout every single agency in the mammoth USDA, “The Last Plantation.” \n The DEFENDANTS have admitted their misdeeds and overt violations of law.  Yet, they continue \ntheir terror against Black Farmers with an indescribable callous disregard, all in the face of judicial, \nlegislative and public scrutiny.      \n4.  This action is brought to dispel the notion that the United States government and its \nUSDA officials can further employ a repugnant racial animus in denying any American citizens, in \nthis matter, Black Farmers and their heirs, the benefits of any federal program or activity on the basis \nof their race, BLACK, and to vindicate the Class Members’ rights as guaranteed by the UNITED \nSTATES CONSTITUTION.    \n                                                                                                                                                             \ninfringing upon. (Citation omitted)  The USDA fails, intentionally and with malice, at both.  \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 3 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 29 of 82\nII. \nNATURE OF THE CASE\n  5.  This case involves DEFENDANTS’ administration, during the period January 1, \n1997 to August 30, 2004, of the USDA and the applications by American Black Farmers for farm \nloans and credit and participation in federal farm programs, (referred to hereinafter as, generally, \n“farm programs”).  PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS \ncontend that DEFENDANTS, when processing applications of African-American farmers for farm \nprograms (1) willfully discriminated against them, and (2) when, in response, PLAINTIFFS and all \nsimilarly situated black farmers filed written discrimination complaints with DEFENDANTS, \nDEFENDANTS failed, although required by, inter alia, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act and 7 C.F.R. §§ 2,28, 15.52 et. seq. to investigate the complaints.  For \nexample, when African-American farmers filed complaints of discrimination with DEFENDANTS, \nDEFENDANTS willfully either (1) avoided processing and  resolving the complains by stretching \nthe review process out over many years; (2) conducted a meaningless, or “ghost investigation”, or \n(3) failed to do anything.  These two acts: (1) the discrimination in denial of the application and (2) \nthe failure to properly investigate the discrimination complaints, deprived the African-American \nfarmers, inter alia, of equal and fair access to farm credit and farm programs, and due process, \nresulting in damages to them. \n  6.  In May, 1997, DEFENDANTS’ officials admitted that in early 1983, the Reagan \nadministration had quietly disbanded and dismantled the civil rights enforcement arm at United \nStates Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and that discrimination complaints had not been \nproperly investigated since that time.  Two federal reports, issued in February, 1997, verified these \nfacts.  \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 4 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 30 of 82\n  7.  In the Pigford v. Veneman  Black Farmers Class Action Complaint, related to the \ncase brought here, a settlement agreement was reached resulting in the denial of benefits to \nthousands of Black Farmers who had filed or could have applications for credit and who filed \ncomplaints of discrimination during the period January, 1983 to December 31, 1996.   \n  8.  Since the filing of the Pigford v. Veneman original complaint, 97cv01978 (PLF), \nnumerous annual reports by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, US Civil Rights Commission, \nGeneral Accounting Office, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and private groups, i.e., \nthe Environmental Working Group, have chronicled the treatment of Black Farmers beyond January \n1, 1997, those PLAINTIFFS, Black Farmers and their heirs, who that now seek justice as the BFAA, \nInc.

There are 190 Individual Class representatives, each of which falls under one of  three \nsubclasses. \n (a)    Plaintiff and Class Representative Charlie Scott (“Scott”) is a Black Farmer who \nfarms in Fayette County, Tn.  Scott is a prevailing Pigford claimant who received the \n$50,000 cash payment in 2000.  Scott applied for a farm operating loan and/or credit in \nFebruary 2001, and was denied the credit and operating because Defendants retaliated \nagainst Scott for filing a claim and receiving benefit there from. The denial of this credit was \ndue to racial discrimination and reprisal against Mr. Scott. This was acknowledged at the \n                                                                                                                                                             \n2 Made applicable to the United States through the FIFTH AMENDMENT, us const. \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 6 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 32 of 82\nhighest level of the agency. The rejection of the FO by the County Committee was directly \ncounter to Agency regulations as well as to its own actions before and after the FO loan \ndecision. Mr. Scott and thousands like him have suffered continued discrimination and \nreprisal, from 1997 thru 2004, even though they applied for the credit, was eligible for the \ncredit and was denied such credit when white farmers received preferential treatment \nregarding such credit and loan extension.  \n(b)  Plaintiff and Class Representative Larry Thomas (“Thomas”) is a farmer in Earl, \nArkansas.  Thomas made application for a farm operating loan in February, 2000. Thomas \nreceived the farm operating loan, however, the loan was received in late July, two months \ntoo late for the planting season, and the loan was inadequate relative to the application made. \nScott is now facing land foreclosure.  Thomas did not receive assistance as a socially \ndisadvantaged farmer.  Thomas was qualified for an adequate loan, applied for an adequate \nloan and was denied an adequate a timely loan while white farmers received adequate loans, \ntimely loans, and assistance from USDA county officials. \n(c)     Plaintiff Walter Powell is a black farmer who resides in Monroe, Louisiana.  Plaintiff \nis but one of approximately three thousand (3000) or more black farmers who (a) attempted \nto apply or timely applied for loans and/or program payments with DEFENDANTS during \nthe period of January 1, 1997 – August 30, 2004, was qualified for such credit and/or \npayments,  yet  denied  and  who  was  the  subject  of  willful  and  continuous  racial \ndiscrimination, and (b) timely filed a complaint or complaints with DEFENDANTS of these \nacts of discrimination. Said complaint(s) were never acted upon pursuant to the applicable \nlaw, causing this plaintiff and thousands of other black farmer substantial damages.

HOW  DEFENDANTS  ARE  ORGANIZED  AND,  GENERALLY,  THE \nGOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AT ISSUE \n \n15.  USDA’s Farm Service Agency (“FSA”) provides commodity program benefits (such \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 11 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 37 of 82\nas deficiency payments, price support loans, conservation reserve benefits), disaster payments, farm \nloans and other farm credit benefits to U. S. farmers.  The agency was created in 1994, as a result of \na  reorganization  of  USDA,  primarily  by  the  merger  of  the  Agricultural  Stabilization  and \nConservation Service (“ASCS”, which previously had handled commodity program benefits, price \nsupport loans, CRP payments, disaster payments, and related services) with the Farmers Home \nAdministration (“FmHA”, which previously had provided farm loans and other farm credit benefits). \n16.  The FmHA was created decades ago to provide loans, credit and technical assistance \nfor formers.  FmHA made loans directly to farmers or guaranteed the loans made to farmers by \nprivate, commercial lenders.  These loans included “farm ownership”, “operating”, and “continuing \nassistance” loans, as well as loans that “restructure” existing loans and” emergency disaster” loans. \n17.  ASCS was an agency of USDA created to provide services to U. S. farmers under the \nprice support, deficiency payment, CRP, and related programs to stabilize farm income and prices, \nand to assist in the conservation of land.  It was consolidated into the Farm Service Agency in 1994. \n18.  DEFENDANTS Veneman is responsible for the administration of the Farm Service \nAgency  (FSA) and previously FmHA & ASCA.  FSA, like FmHA and ASCS before it, administers \nthe federal farm programs through a three-tiered review system consisting of (a) county offices and \ncommittees, (2) state offices and committees, and (3) a federal level of review in Washington, D.C., \nthe National Appeals Division (“NAD”).  The local county committees consist of producers from a \ncounty who have been elected by other producers in that county; they oversee the county offices.  \nThe state committees consist of producers from each state selected by the Secretary of USDA; they \noversee the state officers.  At the federal level NAD renders final determinations of administrative \nappeals. (Prior to the 1994 consolidation, FHA had its own administrative appeal process).   \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 12 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 38 of 82\nB.  PROCEDURE BY WHICH FARMERS (1) APPLIED FOR LOANS AND CREDIT \nWITH  FmHA  AND  (2)  APPLIED  FOR  PARTICIPATION  IN  OTHER  FARM \nPROGRAMS WITH ASCS \n \n19.  Traditionally, when a farmer applied for any FmHA loan or program, he went to his \ncounty office (formerly the FmHA office), and filled out a Farm and Home Plan (FHP), which \nrequired the assistance and guidance of DEFENDANTS’ officials to complete.  Assistance and \nguidance was critical because of the complexity of the programs and forms.  This application \nprocess was done pursuant to regulations found at 7 C.F.R. §1910, et seq.) and Commodity Credit \nCorporation (“CCC”) regulations (7 C.F.R. at §1400, et seq.). \n20.  When the FmHA loan application with its supporting documents was completed it \nwas presented to the county committee.  If approved, the loan was processed.  The Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act (“ECOA”) prohibits discrimination in credit based on sex, marital status, race, \ncolor, age, or national origin, religion, etc. (15 U.S.C. §1691 (a) ).  If an FmHA loan was denied on \ndiscriminatory grounds, the farmer could file a complaint of discrimination with the Secretary of \nUSDA,  the  FmHA  –  Equal  Opportunity  (“EO”)  office  or  with  the  Office  of  Civil  Rights \nEnforcement and Adjudication (“OCREA”), or both. \n21.  With respect to ASCS-type programs, the application was reviewed by the CED and \nthen presented to the county committee.  If approved, the ASCS benefits were awarded.  Title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits exclusion of participation I federal programs based on race, \ncolor or natural origin.  With respect to ASCS-type applications, if a farm program application was \ndenied on discriminatory grounds, the farmer could file a complaint of discrimination with the \nSecretary of USDA or OCREA. \nC.  USDA NON DISCRIMINATION REGULATIONS  (7 C.F.R. §§ 2.28, 15.51 AND \n15.52, AS AMENDED)\n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 13 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 39 of 82\n   \n  22.  As early as 1966, which was eight years prior to ECOA’s enactment, USDA \npromulgated internal management guidelines proscribing discrimination based on Arace, color, \nreligion, sex, age, disability, or national original@ in the administration of any of its direct programs \nand activities.  See 7 C.F.R.  §§ 15.51, 15.52).  See also 31 Fed. Reg. 8175, 8175 (June 10, 1966). \nThese  guidelines  have  remained  in  effect  continuous  since  then  and  include  a  voluntary \nadministrative mechanism by which USDA receives complaints of discrimination involving any \nUSDA program, including the farm credit and ASCS subsidy programs at issue in This case.  See 7 \nC.F.R. §15.52.  Under § 15.52(a), a person who believes he or she have been the victim of \ndiscrimination in programs conducted directly by USDA may file a complaint with USDA’s Office \nof Civil Rights (“OCR”) within 180 days from the date the person knew or should have known of the \nalleged discrimination. OCR then investigates the complaint and determines the corrective actions, if \nany, required to resolve it.  7 C.F.R. §15.52(b).  The regulation sets no deadline by which OCR must \nact on a complaint, it does not establish requirements for how an investigation should be conducted \nor a claim reviewed, and it does not require that USDA advise a complainant regarding the \ndetermination of, or corrective action taken in response to, her complaint.  USDA’s decision to \npromulgate section 15.51 and 15.52 was a voluntary and unilateral one, see 54 Fed. Reg. 31,163, \n31,163(July  27,  1989);  50  Fed.  Reg.  25,687,  25,687(June  21,1985),  and  the  filing  of  an \nadministrative complaint under section 15.52 is not a prerequisite to filing suit against USDA under \nECOA or any other statute.  Instead, section 15.52 was designed to enable USDA to police itself \ninternally and correct any discriminatory conduct that might arise in programs USDA administers \ndirectly.  See 54 Fed. Reg. 31,163, 31,163-164(July 27, 1989) (citing 5 U.S.C. §301) See also 7 \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 14 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 40 of 82\nU.S.C. §15.50.  The USDA Office of Civil Rights has failed at its own regulations and intentionally \nviolates all authorizing federal statutes.  \n  23.  In an effort to give the USDA Civil Rights program more authority, the Congress \nauthorized the creation of a new presidential appointee, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.  \nPresident Bush nominated and the US Senate confirmed Mr. Vernon Parker as Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Rights on April 3, 2003.   \nD.  THE USDA OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS REFUSES TO EXECUTE THE LAW OF \nCIVIL RIGHTS; USDA/OCR: A DISMAL AND INTENTIONAL FAILURE \n   \n24.  The USDA Office of Civil Rights, administered by DEFENDANTS PARKER,  \nthrough Delegation of Authority from DEFENDANTS VENEMAN, has been consistently criticized \nby several government agencies, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, US Commission on \nCivil Rights, etc., by Congressional committees and by its own Office of Inspector General for \nfailing and refusing to conduct its administrative and  regulator authorities, timely, in good faith and \nin accordance with constitutional, statutory   This failure stems from the USDA’s admitted shut \ndown of the Office of Civil Rights by the Reagan White House to the benign neglect by  \nDEFENDANTS  PARKER and VENEMAN who have failed, through acquiescence, omission and \nblatant intention, to settle one administrative complaint, among the thousands of pending complaints, \nby a minority farmer since DEFENDANT PARKER’s appointment as the Assistant Secretary for \nCivil Rights.  DEFENDANT PARKER has refused and continues to refuse to exercise, to the \ndetriment of PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS and others \nsimilarly situated3, the Delegation of Authority in the Code of Federal Regulations, § 7 CFR,  which \n                                                 \n3 On information and belief, DEFENDANT PARKER, with the tacit consent of DEFENDANT \nVENEMAN, on are about August 15, 2003, capriciously and arbitrarily dismissed approximately 3000 \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 15 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 41 of 82\nin detail delineates  the authority and conduct of the USDA’s administrative civil rights program.   \nPLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS and thousands with similar \nsituations have suffered, and in all probability will continue to suffer, as a result of detrimental \nreliance on DEFENDANTS PARKER and VENEMAN and their legally mandated, but non-\nimplemented, administrative civil rights complaint and resolution process.  On information and \nbelief, DEFENDANTS VENEMAN and PARKER have refused and continue to refuse to execute \nthe law and regulations of the land in furtherance of their discriminatory and illegal attempt to \ndestroy the black farm family.   \nVI. \nTHE HISTORICAL OVERVIEW \nPRE PIGFORD V. VENEMAN AND RESULTING CONSENT DECREE\n \nA.  HOW PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS AND \nMEMBERS OF THE PIGFORD CLASS WERE DAMAGED; WHAT DEFENDANTS \nDID IN RESPONSE TO ALL COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION\n \n25.  Unbeknownst to all PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK \nFARMERS and members of each Black Farmer Class, including the one at bar, DEFENDANTS \ndisbanded the enforcement ability of EO and OCREA in 1983, leaving DEFENDANTS with no \nability to investigate discrimination complaints.  In a May 25, 1997 Richmond News Dispatch \nArticle and interview of Lloyd Wright, Director of USDA office of Civil Rights, Mr. Wright stated \nthat (1) no systematic probes or investigations had been taken since 1983, when the Reagan \nadministration disbanded the Civil Rights investigative staff, and (2) that agency regulations and the \nprovisions  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  et  al.  were  violated.    Further  evidence  of \n                                                                                                                                                             \nadministrative complaints of discrimination filed by black farmers employing a self-serving inter-office \nregulation that additional information had to be provided by the complainants within a legally unreasonable \nfifteen period.   \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 16 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 42 of 82\nDEFENDANTS’ willful failure to investigate discrimination complaints is evident in the February \n27, 1997,, Office of Inspector General Report (“OIG”), and the February, 1997 Civil Rights Action \nTeam Report (“CRAT”), both explained below. \n26.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) was required to ensure that Federal agencies met \ntheir  Title  VI  enforcement  obligations  and  provide  civil  rights  protection  to  persons  filing \ndiscrimination complaints in the FSA programs.  DOJ failed to ensure that DEFENDANTS met its \nTitle VI obligations. \n27.  Within USDA, The Policy Analysis and Coordination Center (PACC), an agency \nunder the Assistant Secretary for Administration, was responsible for civil rights compliance and \ndeveloping regulations for processing program discrimination complaints at USDA. [OIG Report, \np.4] OCREA was responsible for processing program discrimination complaints received by USDA \nfrom participants in FSA programs.  [OIG Report, p.4] \n28.  OCREA was required to forward written complaints form FSA program participants \nof discrimination to the appropriate agency with USDA asking the agency to attempt conciliation of \nthe complaint.  If conciliation was not successful, the agency was to be instructed to perform a \npreliminary inquiry and make a recommendation of a finding of discrimination.  If conciliation was \nnot successful, the agency was to be instructed to perform a preliminary inquiry and make a \nrecommendation of a finding of “discrimination” or “no discrimination”.  OCREA was to perform \nits own analysis of the complaint and the preliminary inquiry and make a recommendation to the \nAssistant Secretary for Administration on the finding of “discrimination” or “no discrimination”.  \nThis process never occurred during the relevant period covered by this lawsuit.  [OIG Report, p.4] \n29.  FSA’s Civil Rights and Small Business Staff (CR&SBUS) were responsible for \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 17 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 43 of 82\nhandling program discrimination complaints within FSA.   \n30.  The applicable State Civil Rights Coordinator in FSA was responsible for obtaining a \nconciliation agreement or performing a preliminary inquiry and forward it to CR&SBUS was to \nforward the agreement to OCREA and recommend the discrimination complaint be closed.  If a \npreliminary inquiry was performed, CR&SBUS would analyze the information and determine if \ndiscrimination was found;  CR&SBUS was to forward the preliminary inquiry and its analysis to \nOCREA with its determination.  These procedures were never and are not now properly followed.\n31.  USDA has codified regulations, C.F.R., Part 15 – “Nondiscrimination” which states \nUSDA’s policy of nondiscrimination in federally assisted and conducted programs in compliance \nwith Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The regulations should have served as a basis for civil \nrights compliance and enforcement with respect to participants in FSA programs, however, \nDEFENDANTS  admits the regulations have long been and still are outdated and never reflected the \ndepartmental agencies, programs and law.  (emphasis supplied.) [OIG Report, p.5]\n32.  USDA Regulation 4330-1, which is over 11 years old, dated June 27, 1986, set the \ndepartmental policy for program civil rights compliance reviews, but does not provide policy and \nguidance for processing program discrimination complaints. [OIG Report, p.5] \n33.  On December 12, 1994, in a management alert to the ten Office of Civil Rights \nEnforcement, DEFENDANTS’ Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported problems with how \nUSDA received, processed, and resolved program discrimination complaints. OIG recommended \nthat “a departmental regulation be promulgated that sets forth the authorities of the Office of Civil \nRights Enforcement and that written procedures and controls be established governing the receipt, \nprocessing, and resolution of  program discrimination complaints within established timeframes”. \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 18 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 44 of 82\n[OIG Report, p.5] \n34.  The regulation was never published.\n35.  After years of abuse and benign neglect of African American farmers, OIG finally \nundertook an investigation and review, the results of which were released on February 27, 1997, of \nDEFENDANTS’ program discrimination complaints within FSA as well as 10 other agencies within \nUSDA.  OIG found,  inter alia, that the discrimination complaint process within USDA lacked \n“integrity,” and “accountability” was without a tracking system, was in “disorder”, did not resolve \ndiscrimination complaints, and had a massive backlog: \nThe program discrimination complaint process at FSA lacks integrity, \ndirection and accountability.  The staff responsible for processing \ndiscrimination complaints receives little guidance from management, \nfunctions in the absence of any current position descriptions or \ninternal  procedures,  and  is  beset  with  its  own  personnel  EEO \nproblems.  The staff also processes discrimination complaints without \na reliable tracking system to determine the status of the complaints, \nand, apparently, without deadlines to resolve the complaints.  The \nresulting climate of disorder has brought the complaint system within \nFSA  to  a  near  standstill.    Little  gets  accomplished  to  resolve \ndiscrimination complaints or to make program managers aware of \nalleged problems within their programs.  After developing our own \ndata base of unresolved cases, we determined that as of January 27, \n1997,  FSA  had  an  outstanding  backlog  of  241  complaints.” \n(Emphasis added) [OIG Report, p.6] \n \n36.  OIG found that the staff responsible for processing the discrimination complaints \nconsisted of two untrained and unqualified people: \nThe FSA staff responsible for processing discrimination complaints, \nthe  Civil Rights and Small Business Utilization Staff (CR&SBUS)” \nhas two full-time program specialists working to resolve program \ncomplaints.  These program specialists are supplemented by an \nadministrative assistant who provides secretarial support and two \nstaff assistants who maintain case files and the tracking system.  The \ntwo program specialists and the two staff assistants transferred to  \nFSA  from  the  civil  rights  staff  of  the  former  Farmer’s  Home \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 19 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 45 of 82\nAdministration (FmHA) during the Department’s reorganization in \nOctober 1995.  The staff assistants have been performing analyses of \nthe preliminary inquiries conducted on the complaints, although they \nare not trained or otherwise qualified to do so.  None of the former \nFmHA employees with CR&SBUS have position descriptions to \nreflect  their  current  duties  and  responsibilities,  and  none  have \nreceived performance appraisals for fiscal year 1996. \n \nOIG Report, p.6 (emphasis added). \n \n37.  OIG found a “massive backlog” of unprocessed FSA complaints. (OIG Report, p.6).  \nOIG found the FSA files “disorganized” and unaccountable: \n…CR&SBUS was unable to provide us with an accurate number of \noutstanding complaints or their status.  We reviewed the case files \nand found them generally disorganized.  It was difficult for us to \nreadily determine the date of the complaint, the reason it was brought, \nand the status of its resolution. \n \nOIG Report, p.7 (emphasis added). \n \n38.  OIG found hundreds of FSA cases unresolved: \n  Our review at the CR&SBUS and CREA disclosed that, \nbetween them, they had listed a total of 272 cases as being active.  \nThe oldest case listed dates back to 1986. *** After resolving all \nduplications and determining the actual status of the 272 cases, we \nfound that  FSA had 241 cases of program discrimination complaints \nthat had not been resolved.   \n \nOIG Report, p.7 (emphasis added). \n \n39.  OIG found repeated unaccountability and missing files: \n  During our reconciliation of the two agencies’ lists, we noted \nthat some cases were listed by one or the other agency but could not \nbe found in its filing system.  CR&SBUS listed 32 cases that we \ncould not find in its filing system, and CREA listed 28 cases that we \ncould not find in its filing system.  WE also noted that CR&SBUS \nlisted cases unknown to CREA.  CR&SBUS listed 19 cases that \nCREA did not list.” \n \nOIG Report, p.7. \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 20 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 46 of 82\n \n40.  OIG found there was no reliable method to the processing: \n  CREA had officially closed 30 of the 272 cases with findings \nof no discrimination.  CREA had also closed one case with a finding \nof discrimination, and the complainant was compensated.  The case \ninvolved the FSA disaster program, and the complainant received \nwhich were at first denied by FSA.  Four of the remaining 24 cases \nhad findings of discrimination as determined by CREA and are \npending resolution.  On of the four complainants has not responded to \nthe  Department’s  written  notice  regarding  filing  a  claim  for \ncompensation.  Offices of Operations officials are negotiating a \nsettlement with the remaining three complainants. \nOIG Report, pp. 7-8. \n \n41.  OIG found improperly closed files and improper reviews, and many files with no \ndocumentation. \n  We found that FSA improperly closed and forwarded 30 \ncomplaints to program managers, without notifying the Department \n(26  of  30  cases  were  closed  under  the  old  FmHA  agency \nmanagement).  The civil rights staff concluded without first receiving \nconcurrence from the Department that these cases were the result of \n“programmatic discrepancies” (i.e., agency error rather than civil \nrights  violations).    Without  departmental  concurrence  with  its \nfindings, the agency may not have addressed the legitimate cases of \ndiscrimination.    CREA  has  the  responsibility  to  make  final \ndetermination of  program discrimination.  FSA may recommend to  \nCREA that cases be closed, but it does not have the authority to close \nthese cases without concurrence from CREA.  For example, we noted \nthat in one instance FSA (the former FmHA) incorrectly concluded \nthat a case had only programmatic concerns and closed the case \nwithout forwarding it to the Department.  Only after a civil rights \nstaff member complained, did FSA process the case as a civil rights \ndiscrimination case.  The civil rights staff stated in a letter that the \nallegation of racial discrimination was overlooked.  The mix-up was \ndiscussed with the Department, which determined that the case \nshould be process by the civil rights staff.  For most of the remaining \ncases, we found no Department has reviewed these cases. \n \nOIG Report, p.8 (emphasis added). \n \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 21 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 47 of 82\n42.  OIG found 58% of the FSA civil rights complaint case files were over 1 year old and \nover 150 cases were almost two years old: \n. . . the average age of the 241 cases we consider open because they \nwere not officially closed by the Department. \n \n  No. of Cases      Program    Average Age\n \n151  Ag.

Of the 241 cases, 129 (54 percent) are awaiting action in \nFSA; the remaining 112 cases, 46 percent) are in the hands of the \nCREA staff in USDA’s Office of Operations.  Sixty-five of the cases \nat FSA (50 percent) need a preliminary inquiry.  Some of these date \nback to 1993. \n \nOIG Report, p.8. \n \n43.  OIG found no system within FSA for reconciliation or tracking of civil rights \ncomplaint cases: \nCR&SBUS has no procedures in place to reconcile or track the status \nof  complaints  after  they  are  forwarded  to  CREA.    Therefore, \nCR&SBUS could not tell us the status of complaints at CREA.  As \nnoted above, both CR&SBUS and CREA had different numbers and \nwere not aware of all the outstanding complaints. \n \nOIG Report, p.8 (emphasis added). \n \n44.  OIG found no management oversight within FSA with respect to the handling of civil \nrights complaints: \n  CR&SBUS also does not prepare management reports to \ninform FSA program managers of alleged problems of discrimination \nwithin their programs.  Without this information, program managers \nmay not be aware of potential discrimination in the programs they are \nresponsible for administering. \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 22 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 48 of 82\n \nOIG Report, p.9. \n \n45.  With respect to DEFENDANTS’ Office of Operations, Civil Rights Enforcement and \nAdjudication (CREA), OIG found repeated inaccuracies and unaccountability: \n  . . .that the listing of outstanding cases provided by CREA \ncontained inaccurate information.  In some instances we were unable \nto locate the case files at CREA that were on its outstanding case list. \n Without reviewing the case files, were unable to verify the status of \nthe complaints.  Also, CREA and FSA had not reconciled their cases, \nand neither could inform us of the correct number of outstanding \ncases. \n \n  CREA does not have controls in place to monitor and track \ndiscrimination complaints.  When complaints are received they are \nlogged in, given a case number, and after the agency forwards the \npreliminary inquiry to CREA, the case is assigned to one of its seven \nprogram specialists to follow up on overdue responses from the \nagency.    We  have  found  that  CREA  is  not  following  up  on \ndiscrimination  cases  it  returned  to  FSA  for  conciliation  or \nperformance of a preliminary inquiry.  CREA advises the agency that \nit has 90 days to complete its review, but it does not follow up with \nthe agency to determine the status of the complaint. \n \nOIG Report, p.9. \n \n46.  OIG surveyed 10 other USDA program agencies in addition to FSA, to determine the \nprocedures used for processing program discrimination complaints and found the same problems.  \n[OIG Report, pp. 10-11] \n47.  OIG compiled a list of outstanding (“open) program discrimination complaints, as \nlate as 1996, within the Department, totaling 271. [OIG Report, at Attachment A] \n48.  At the same time that OIG released its report, a USDA Civil Rights Action Team \nreleased  a  report,  dated  February  1997,  condemning  DEFENDANTS’  lack  of  civil  rights \nenforcement and lack of accountability which, inter alia, were a cause of the drastic decline in the \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 23 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 49 of 82\nnumber of African American farmers.  (The Report is hereinafter referred to as “CRAT”): \n  According to the most recent Census of Agriculture, the \nnumber of all minority farms has fallen –from 950,000 in 1920 to \naround 60,000 in 1992.  For African Americans, the number fell from \n925,000, 14 percent of all farms in 1920, to only 18,000, 1 percent of \nall farms in 1920. \n \n[CRAT, p.14]. \n \n49.  CRAT  found  a  common  problem  involved  minority  farmers  applying  to \nDEFENDANTS loans:    \n  The minority or limited-resource farmer tries to apply for a \nfarm operating loan through the FSA county office well in advance of \nplanting season.  The FSA county office might claim to have no \napplications available and ask the farmer to return later.  Upon \nreturning,  the  farmer  might  receive  an  application  without  any \nassistance in completing it, then is asked repeatedly to correct \nmistakes or complete oversight in the loan application.  Often these \nrequests for correcting the application could be stretched for months, \nsince they would come if the minority farmer contacted the office to \ncheck on the loan processing.  By the time processing is completed, \neven when the loan is approved, planting season has already passed, \nand the farmer either has not been able to plant at all, or has obtained \nlimited credit on the strength of an expected FSA loan to plant a \nsmall crop, usually without the fertilizer and other supplies necessary \nfor the best yields.  The farmer’s profit is then reduced. \n \n [CRAT, p.15 (emphasis added)] \n \n50.  CRAT found systematic mistreatment of minority farmers: \n \n  If the farmer’s promised FSA loan finally does arrive, it may \nhave been arbitrarily reduced, leaving the farmer without enough \nmoney to repay suppliers and any mortgage or equipment debts.  In \nsome cases, the FSA loan never arrives, again leaving the farmer \nwithout any means to repay debts.  Further operating and disaster \nloans may be denied because of the farmer’s debt load, making it \nimpossible for the farmer to earn any money from the farm.  As an \nalternative,  the  local  FSA  official  might  offer  the  farmer  an \nopportunity to lease back the land with an option to buy it back later. \n The appraised value of the land is set very high, presumably to \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 24 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 50 of 82\nsupport the needed operating loans, but also making repurchase of the \nland beyond the limited-resource farmer’s means.  The land is lost \nfinally and sold at auction, where it is bought by someone else at half \nthe price being asked of the minority farmer.  Often, it is alleged that \nthe person was a friend or relative of one of the FSA county officials. \n \n [CRAT, p.16 (emphasis added)] \n \n51.  CRAT found insufficient oversight of farm credit to minorities: \n \n  Currently,  the  Farm  and  Foreign  Agricultural  Services  \n(FFAS) Mission Area, which manages the FSA program delivery \nsystem, provides ineffective oversight of the local delivery of farm \ncredit services. \n \n[CRAT, p.16 (emphasis added)] \n \n52.  CRAT found a lack of diversity in FSA program delivery structure: \n \n  Because of the ways in which State and county committees \nare chosen and county offices are staffed, FSA lacks diversity in its \nprogram  delivery  structure.    Federal  EEO  and  Affirmative \nEmployment laws and policies do not govern the FSA non-Federal \nworkforce except by agency regulation. \n \n[CRAT, p.18 (emphasis added)] \n \n53.  CRAT found a lack of minority employees in  FSA county offices: “A recent GAO \nstudy indicated that in the 101 counties with the largest concentration of minority farmers, one-\nquarter had no minority employees in their offices.” [CRAT, p. 18]. \n \n54.  CRAT found lower participation rates and lower approval rates for minorities in  FSA \nprograms: \n  Recent studies requested by Congress and FSA have found \nlower participation  and lower loan approval rates for minorities \ninmost FSA programs.  Participation rates in 1994 in programs of the \nformer Agricultural  Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 25 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 51 of 82\nparticularly  commodity  programs  and  disaster  programs,  were \ndisproportionately low for all minorities.  The GAO found that \nbetween October 1, 1994 and March 31, 1996, 33 percent of minority \napplications but only 27 percent of non-minority application in the \nAgricultural Conservation Program (ACP) were disapproved.  During \nthe same period, 16 percent of minority but only 10 percent of non-\nminority loans in the direct loan program were disapproved. \n \n[CRAT, p.21 (emphasis added)] \n \n55.  For some states, the approval rates for farm loans were widely disparate: \n \n  For example, only 67 percent of African-American loans were \napproved in Louisiana, compared to 83 percent of non-minority \nloans.  Alabama showed a similar disparity  --only 78 percent of \nAfrican-American l0ans approved compared to 90 percent of non-\nminority loans. \n \n[CRAT, p.21 (emphasis added)] \n \n56.  CRAT found minorities endured longer loan processing times: \n  Again, however, some States showed consistently longer \nprocessing times for minorities.  In the Southeast, for example, in \nseveral States it took three times as long on average to process \nAfrican-American  loan  applications  as  it  did  non-minority \napplications.    Similar  disparities  between  non-minority  loan \nprocessing and American Indian loan processing appeared in records \nfor a number of States included in  FSA’s Northwest region. \n \n[CRAT, p.21]. \n \n57.  CRAT found discrimination complaints at USDA were often ignored: \n  Farmers who told the CRAT stories of discrimination and \nabuse by USDA agencies also described a complaints processing \nsystem  which,  if  anything,  often  makes  matters  worse.    They \ndescribed a bureaucratic nightmare where, even after they receive a \nfinding of discrimination, USDA refuses to pay damages.  They \ncharged USDA with forcing them into court to seek justice, rather \nthan working with them to redress acknowledged grievances.  They \npainfully described the toll these ongoing battles with USDA have \ntaken on their families, and on their health. \n \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 26 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 52 of 82\n[CRAT, p. 22-23]. \n \n58.  CRAT found decisions favoring farmers routinely not enforced by USDA: “However, \nmany farmers, especially small farmers, who have managed to appeal their cases to FSA charge that \neven when decisions are overturned, local offices often do not honor the decision.  They claim that \ndecisions favoring farmers are simply “not enforced”. \n59.  CRAT found a lack of USDA regulations for discrimination complaint processing: \n  Program discrimination complaints generally fall within two \ncategories: (1)  programs conducted directly by a USDA agency, such \nas USDA loan programs, and (2) federal assisted programs, where \nUSDA does not directly offer services to customers, but recipients of \nUSDA funds do.  The recipients must obey civil rights laws, and \nUSDA can be sued under such laws as Title VI, the Rehabilitation \nAct, IX, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and others.  CRAT \nmembers were informed by OGC that USDA presently  has no \npublished regulations with clear guidance on the process or time lines \ninvolved in program discrimination complaints. When a farmer does \nallege  discrimination,  “preliminary  investigations”  are  typically \nconducted by the agency that has been charged with violating her or \nhis right. \n \n[CRAT, p.24]. \n \n60.  CRAT found discrimination complaints often are not responded to by USDA: “. . . \nUSDA doesn’t respond even when they do file complaints.  In Tulsa, OK. , an advocate representing \nblack and American Indian farmers said, “we have filed 72 civil rights complaints.  Not one \ncomplaint has even been answered.” [CRAT, p.24] \n61.  CRAT found record-keeping on discrimination complaints “non-existent” and that a \nbacklog existed: \n  The CRAT was unable to gather historical data on program discrimination \ncomplaints at USDA because record keeping on these matters has been virtually \nnonexistent.  Complaints filed with the agencies are not necessarily reported to \nUSDA’s Civil Rights office.  Some figures are available however, for cases that were \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 27 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 53 of 82\nopen as of December 31, 1996.  The largest number of pending discrimination \ncomplaints, as comments at the listening sessions suggests, are concentrated in three \nagencies at USDA.  There were 205 cases pending, representing 42 percent of the \ntotal, against the FSS: 165, or 33.3 percent against the Rural Housing Service (RHS); \nand 62, or 12.5 percent against the Food and Consumer Services.  Sixty-three cases, \nor 12.7 percent of the total, were pending against other agencies.  The Department \nhad a total of 495 pending program discrimination complaints.  Approximately one-\nhalf of the  pending cases are two years old or older, verifying farmer’s contention \nthat  complaints are being processed slowly, if at all.  According to the Complaints \nProcessing Division at the Office of Operation (OO), which processes complaints \nthat make it to the Department level?  USDA averages about 200 new program \ndiscrimination complaints each year.  However, in fiscal year 1996, an average of \nonly 9 cases was closed per month, or 108 during the year – increasing a backlog of \nprogram complaints. \n \n[CRAT, pp. 24-25 (emphasis added)] \n \n62.  CRAT uncovered neglect of and bias against minorities by USDA, resulting in a loss \nof farmers’ land and income. \n  The recent Civil Rights listening session revealed a general \nperception  of  apathy,  neglect,  and  a  negative  bias  towards  all \nminorities on the part of most local USDA government officials \ndirectly  involved  in  decision  making for program delivery.  A \nreporter at the recent listening session in Tulsa, Oklahoma observed \nthat minority farmers are not sure which condition “was worse – \nbeing ignored by the USDA and missing potential opportunities or \ngetting involved with its programs and facing a litany of abuses.  \nMinority farmers have lost significant amounts of land and potential \nfarm income as a result discrimination of FSA programs and the \nprograms of its predecessor agencies, ASCS and FmHA.  Socially \ndisadvantaged  and  minority  farmers  said  USDA  is  part  of  a \nconspiracy to take their land and look to USDA for some kind of \ncompensation for their losses. \n \n[CRAT, p. 30]. \n \n63.  CRAT found USDA the fifth worst (of 56 government agencies) in  hiring minorities: \n  According to the US Department of Labor, between 1990 and \n2000, women, minorities, and immigrants will account for 80 percent \nof the United States labor force growth.  The “Framework for \nChange: Work Force Diversity and Delivery of Programs,” a USDA \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 28 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 54 of 82\nreport released in 1990, found that USDA had a need to remedy \nunder-representation in its workforce by providing equal employment \nand promotion opportunities for all employees.  When this statement \nwas made, USDA ranked 52 out of 56 Federal agencies in the \nemployment of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. \n \n[CRAT, p.33]. \n \n64.  CRAT found the lack of diversity at USDA adversely affects program delivery to \nminorities:   “USDA’s workforce does not reflect the diversity of its customer base.  The lack of \ndiversity in field offices adversely affects program delivery to minority and women customers of \nUSDA.” [CRAT, p.45] \n65.  CRAT found a lack of resources at USDA to ensure fair and equitable (non-\ndiscriminatory ) program delivery to farmers: \n  The Assistant Secretary for Administration is USDA’s senior \nofficial responsible for civil rights.  Although that position has the \nresponsibility for civil rights policy and compliances, it does not have \nthe authority or resources necessary to ensure that programs are \ndelivered and employees are treated fairly and equitably. \n \n[CRAT, p.46]. \n \n66.  CRAT found enforcement of civil rights at USDA in program delivery lacking: \n  Another  problem  with  enforcing  civil  rights  in  program \ndelivery is fragmentation.  Agency civil rights directors have a \nnumber of responsibilities.  For example, USDA agencies each \nperform  come  complaint  processing  functions.    However,  the \nCommission  noted  that  the  respective  roles  of  OCRE  and  the \nagencies were not clearly defined.  The Commission also found that \nOCRE was providing technical assistance to agencies on civil rights \nstatutes, not proactively, but only when requested. \n \n[CRAT, p.51] \n \n67.  CRAT found a lack of civil rights specialists and knowledge for program-related civil \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 29 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 55 of 82\nrights issues at USDA: \n  The Civil Rights Commission’s report on the lack of Title VI \nenforcement also pointed to USDA’s lack of civil rights specialists in \nprogram-related civil rights issues.  Many of the Department’s civil \nrights  resources  are  devoted  to  processing  of  employment \ndiscrimination complaints.  Of the current staff in the Department’s \ntwo civil rights offices, two-thirds work on EEO complaints.  That \nmeans only a small percentage of USDA’s  civil rights staff works on \ncivil rights issues relating to program delivery.  According to the \nCommission,  the  1994  civil  rights  reorganization  was  deficient \nbecause OCRE did not separate internal and external civil rights \nissues into separate offices.  The Commission predicted that “a \nprobable consequence is that USDA’s Title VI enforcement program \nmay suffer as OCRE responds to pressures to improve USDA’s \ninternal civil rights program.”  It recommended that USDA establish \n“two separate units, with different supervisory staff,” one for internal \nand one for external civil rights issues. \n \n[CRAT, p.54] \n \n68.  CRAT found DEFENDANTS’ counsel hostile to civil rights, if not racist: \n  The perception that the Office of the General Counsel [at \nUSDA] is hostile to civil rights has been discussed earlier in this \nreport.  OGC’s legal positions on civil rights issues are perceived as \ninsensitive at the least, and racist at worst.  Correcting this problem is \ncritical to the success of USDA’s civil rights program. \n \n[CRAT, p.55] \n \n69.  CRAT  found DEFENDANTS’ counsel often have no civil rights experience or \neducation: \n  However, the CRAT has found that attorneys who practice \ncivil  rights  law  at  [USDA’s]  OGC  are  not  required  to  have \nspecialized experience or education in civil rights when they are \nhired.  They acquire their civil rights experience on the job.  In \naddition, most of OGC’s lawyers working on civil rights issues work \non non-civil rights issues as well. \n \n[CRAT, p.55] \n \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 30 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 56 of 82\n70.  In sum, CRAT concluded that DEFENDANTS does not support or enforce civil \nrights: \n  USDA does not have the structure in place to support an \neffective  civil  rights  program.    The  Assistant  Secretary  for \nAdministration lacks authority and resources essential to ensure \naccountability among senior management ranks.  There has been \ninstability and lack of skilled leadership at the position of USDA \nDirector of Civil Rights.  Dividing up the Department’s Civil Rights \noffice between policy and complaints  has further exacerbated the \nproblem.  The division of responsibility for civil rights among \ndifferent  USDA  offices  and  agencies  has  left  confusion  over \nenforcement  responsibilities.    Finally,    OGC  is  perceived  as \nunsupportive of civil rights. \n \n[CRAT, p. 56] \n \n71.  On September 29, 1997, USDA’s Office of Inspector General issued Phase II of the \nOIG Report on Civil Rights Issues, entitled “Minority Participation In Farm Service Agency’s Farm \nLoan Programs – Phase II” (hereafter “OIG Report Phase II”) which found, inter alia that (a) \nDEFENDANTS has resolved only 32 of the 241 outstanding discrimination complaints reported in \nthe OIG Report (back in February, 1997) and (b) that the backlog of discrimination complaints had \nincreased from 241 to 474 for FSA and from 530 to 984 for all of USDA. \n72.  On September 30, 1998, the USDA’s Office of Inspector General released its “Report \nto the Secretary on Civil Rights Issues – Phase V” [hereinafter “OIG Report V”], which supplements \nPLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS claims and supporting \nmaterials in this lawsuit and in the above pending motions.  In particular, OIG Report V states, inter \nalia:\ni.  “We  found  that  the  Department  [USDA],  t  through  CR \n(Office of Civil Rights], has not made significant progress in \nreducing the complaints backlog.  Whereas the backlog stood \nat 1,088 complaints on November 1, 1997, it still remains at \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 31 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 57 of 82\n616 complaints as of September 11, 1998.”  OIG Report V, \ncover letter to the Secretary. \n \nii.  The backlog is not being resolved at a faster rate because CR \nitself has not attained the efficiency it needs to systematically \nreduce the caseload.  Few of the deficiencies we noted in our \nprevious reviews have been corrected.  The office is still in \ndisarray, providing no decisive leadership and making little \nattempt to correct the mistakes of the past.  We noted with \nconsiderable concern that after 20 months,  CR has made \nvirtually no progress implementing the corrective actions we \nthought essential to the viability of its operations. OIG Report \nV at I (emphasis added). \n \niii.  Most conspicuous among the uncorrected problems is the \ncontinuing disorder within CR.  The database CR uses to \nreport the status of cases is unreliable and full of error, and \nthe files it keeps to store needed documentation are slovenly \nand unmanaged.  Forty complaint files could not be found, \nand another 130 complaints that were listed in USDA agency \nfiles were not recorded in  CR’s data base.  Management \ncontrols were so poor that we could not render an opinion on \nthe quality of CR’s investigations and adjudications.”  OIG \nReport V at iii (emphasis added). \n \niv.  “Of equal significance is the absence of written policy and \nprocedures.” OIG Report V at iii. \n \nv.  “The absence of formal procedures and accurate records \nraises  questions  about  due  care  within  the  complaints \nresolution process.  We found critical quality control steps \nmissing at every stage of the process.  Staff members with \nlittle training and less experience were put to judging matters \nthat carry serious legal and moral implications.  Many of \nCR’s  adjudicators,  who  must  determine  whether \ndiscrimination occurred, were student interns.  Legal staff \nmembers with the Office of  General Counsel (PGC), who \nreview CR’s decisions for legal sufficiency,  have had to \nreturn  over  half  of  them  because  they  were  based  on \nincomplete  data  or  faulty  analysis.    We  noted  that  a \ndisproportionately  large  percent  of  the  616  cases  of \nunresolved backlog had bottlenecked in the adjudication \nunit.”  OIG Report V at iii (emphasis added). \n \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 32 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 58 of 82\n73.  In sum, DEFENDANTS’ willful disregard of, and failure to properly investigate, \nAfrican-American discrimination complaints began with the disbanding of civil rights enforcement \nfunctions back in 1983, until February 1997 when the current administration reorganized and \nreestablished the enforcement staff of the civil rights office, and since February, 1987, has gotten \nworse, as evidenced by the massive increase of backlogged, unresolved cases and overall disarray in \nthe USDA Office of Civil Rights as reported in the most recent OIG Report.  \nB.

In the Pigford lawsuit Memorandum and Order approving the Consent Decree, the \nCourt opined regarding the Consent Decree’s flaws and weaknesses by asserting that the \nagreement was “moot on forward looking injunctive relief” and the restructuring of the antiquated \ncounty committee system that led to the gross deprivation of rights and discrimination against the \nPigford class members.               .  \n76.  The Environmental Working Group, a public interest group which studies US \nAgriculture policy, released a report,  “Obstruction of Justice: USDA Undermines Historic Civil \nRights Settlement for Black Farmers”,July 26, 2004, essentially concluding that the Pigford \nlawsuit has been rendered an abject failure. The EWG in describing the Pigford failures stated as \nfollows: \nA.  Deadline barred 64,000 claims, despite lack of notice. The \nsettlement-funded arbitrator rejected 64,000 farmers who \ncame forward with claims during the late claims process \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 33 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 59 of 82\nestablished  by  the  court.  The  late  claims  process  was \nnecessary  because  the  farmers'  attorneys,  whose \nrepresentation was characterized by the court as \"bordering \non legal malpractice,\" failed to notify the farmers of the \noriginal  deadline  for  application.  The  settlement-funded \narbitrator rejected these 64,000 farmers simply on the basis of \ntheir tardiness for the original deadline, even though all \n64,000  rejected  claims  were  submitted  within  the  court \nestablished late claims period. An additional 7,800 farmers \nfailed to file before the late claims deadline expired and were \nalso denied entry to the class. \nB.  Nearly  nine  out  of  ten  denied  restitution.    USDA  \naggressively fought claims by African American farmers, \ncontracting with United States Department of Justice lawyers \nwho  spent  at  least  56,000  staff  hours  and  $12  million \ncontesting individual farmer claims for discrimination. \n77.  The Black Farmers’ saga and the Pigford’s “disaster” have been chronicled in news \ncoverage, print and electronic, all over the country since the release of the EWG Report.

In 1996, and after years of abuse and complaints, the OIG initiated a series of civil rights \ncompliance, employee and programmatic investigations4, some of which are above delineated.  \nSubsequent to Pigford, the OIG continued its annual investigations up to and including the year 2000 \nat which time the OIG investigations and reports abruptly ceased.5\n80.

Civil  rights  offices  and  staff  are  situated \nthroughout the Department… The Department has one of the most \ncomplex  and  decentralized  civil  rights  structures  in  the  federal \ngovernment.

USDA/OCR could not distinguish its Title VI (Title VII or \nECOA) workload or expenditures from those of the activities that \nother civil rights statues required.  OCR could not plan reasonable \ngoals for Title VI (Title VII or ECOA) enforcement. . . In addition \nOCR’s guidance is still confusing. . .USDA/OCR, FSA had not made \nmany improvements or changes since the Commission evaluated \nwhat was the FmHA (FSA) in 1996. . . FSA/OCR does not have the \nability to submit and control its own budget. . .In 1996, the agency \nsubmitted Civil Rights Implementation Plans to DOJ, but today the \nagency is not required to submit plans because it conducts few if any \npre-award and post-award reviews and has no record of legal and \nadministrative activity. . . despite its legal, administrative and \nregulatory authority and mandate to so do.  \n \nId. at 34, 52 (emphasis added). \n84.

The GAO stated:          \n                         \nPursuant to a congressional request, GAO discussed the Department \nof Agriculture's (USDA) efforts to process discrimination complaints, \nfocusing on the: \n(1)  timeliness and ability of USDA's Office of Civil Rights \n(OCR) to process employment discrimination complaints; and  \n(2)  reasons  for  delays  in  the  implementing  GAO's  previous \nrecommendations. \n \nGAO noted that: \n(1)  a number of long-standing problems are impending USDA's \nefforts to improve delays in its processing of discrimination \ncomplaints within its Civil Rights Program, including: \n  (a) continuing management turnover and reorganizations in \nUSDA's OCR; \n  (b)  inadequate staff and managerial expertise; \n  (c)  a lack of clear, up-to-date guidance and procedures; \nand  \n  (d)  poor working relationships and communication within \nOCR and between the office and other USDA entities;  \n \n(2)  USDA is not consistently using alternative dispute resolution \ntechniques, such as mediation, to address workplace and other \ndisputes before they become formal complaints; \n(3)  USDA  has  drafted  a  long-term  improvement  plan  to \nsystematically address problems in the program which they \nplan to implement in October 2000; \n(4)  to address personnel problems in OCR, USDA plans to: \ndevelop an (a) assessment of the skills needed for OCR; (b) \nimplement training programs to properly educate employees; \nand  (c)  to  conduct  performance  evaluations  that  would \nprovide the basis for taking appropriate action in regard to \nemployees who are not performing at acceptable levels; \n(5)  OCR is in the process of issuing two operations manuals and \nseveral  standard  operating  procedures  for  implementing \nregulations addressing complaint processing; \n(6)  OCR's implementation of the program complaint process was \nhindered by agencies' disagreement with OCR about their role \nin the program complaint process and by inadequate OCR \nguidance; \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 39 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 65 of 82\n(7)  OCR also has difficulties in developing effective working \nrelationships with the Office of General Counsel, which \nfurther  lead  to  inefficiencies  and  delays  in  processing \ncomplaints; \n(8)  inadequate communication within OCR also contributed to \nlow morale and productivity; \n(9)  according to USDA's Assistant Secretary for Administration, \nOCR meets regularly with a committee of agency civil rights \ndirectors; \n(10)  GAO's 1999 report on this matter found that USDA's Civil \nRights Program had a long way to go before it achieved the \nSecretary's stated goal of making USDA the civil rights \nleader in the federal government; \n(11)  plans to address civil rights complaints will require long-term \nimplementation, including funding for hiring and training \npersonnel; and \n(12)  it appears as if the Secretary's goal, at least in the short term, \nremains elusive. \n \nU.S. Department of Agriculture: Problems in Processing Discrimination Complaints (Testimony, \n09/12/2000, GAO/T-RCED-00-286). \n85.  In reporting to the Secretary on the implementation of program administrative \nsettlement agreements resulting from USDA’s admitted discrimination and USDA’s refusal to \ndiscipline the offending government officials, Inspector General Roger C.

Even though there was a high probability that discrimination did \nindeed occur. . . no disciplinary action has been taken against any \ndiscriminating official.  CR (Office of Civil Rights, OCR) has \nprovided agencies no formal guidance on how to proceed. . . We have \nconsistently urged CR to provide guidance on all stages of the \ncomplaint resolution process. . . CR remained unaware of the number \nand status of all agreements. CR was not tracking the implementation \nof the agreements, and it offered no formal guidance on cases that \nhad  been  referred  for  disciplinary  action.

ECOA provides for monetary relief to both individuals and \nclass members who are damaged by creditors who violate the statute: \nAny creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed \nunder this subchapter shall be liable to the aggrieved applicant for \nany actual damages sustained by such applicant acting either in an \nindividual capacity or as a member of a class. \n \n15 U.S.C. §1691e(a). Thirdly, district courts are invested with the authority to \nprovide equitable and declaratory relief: \nUpon application by an aggrieved applicant, the appropriate United \nStates district court or any other court of competent jurisdiction may \ngrant such equitable and declaratory relief as is necessary to enforce \nthe requirements imposed under this subchapter. \n \n15 U.S.C. §1691e(c) (emphasis added).

In sum, this court has jurisdiction to grant actual damages, equitable and declaratory \nrelief, costs and attorneys fees, and ECOA contains a waiver of United States sovereign immunity. \n95.  When the class members filed discrimination complaints, they fell four-square under \nthe umbrella of ECOA.  It is PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK \nFARMERS’ belief that ninety-five percent of class members filed complaints of discrimination with \nrespect to the USDA loan application process.  Only five percent have claims for denial of disaster \napplications. \n96.  DEFENDANTS do not dispute the waiver of sovereign immunity under ECOA.    \nPlaintiffs assert that there is no just reason for denying the remaining five percent of PLAINTIFFS \nAND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS’ relief for complaints of discrimination \ninvolving disaster benefits.  While ECOA covers farm “credit” programs, but not disaster programs, \nthe APA provides an avenue of relief for Black farmers who have been denied equal access to \ndisaster programs and, subsequently, due process of law in challenging the implementation of that \nprogram.  The implementation of USDA’s credit programs and other programs were closely \nintertwined and the violation of PLAINTIFFS AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK \nFARMERS’ rights equally egregious in both areas.  Racial discrimination ran rampant under both \nprograms, and neither offered Black farmers an opportunity to appeal to a civil rights enforcement \nbody to obtain relief.  Further, in many instances, the calculation of loans under the credit program \nand payments or benefits under the other programs were interdependent.  For example, the amount \nof program benefits or program allotments that a farmer could receive for the crop of a commodity \n(such as cotton, corn, wheat, rice, peanuts, or tobacco) in a year required a review of his or her \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 48 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 74 of 82\nfarming history, which, in turn, was directly related to the yield per acre the farmer cultivated, which \nwas dependent on the amount of operating credit made available to the farmer. \n97.  Class members are seeking redress for the denial of due process to the members of \nthe class for the discriminatory implementation of these interconnected farm programs and for the \nDEFENDANTS’ failure regarding these programs to provide sufficient civil rights investigation and \nenforcement. \nB.  ECOA STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS WAIVED \n98.  On October 21, 1998, the President signed into law the Omnibus Consolidated \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999, P.L. 105-___.  This legislation contains the following \nprovisions: \nSec. 741.  Waiver of Statute of Limitations. \na.  To the extent permitted by the Constitution, any civil action \nto obtain relief with respect to the discrimination alleged in an \neligible complaint, if commenced not later than 2 years after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act, shall not be barred by \nany statute of limitations. \n \nb.  The complainant may, in lieu of filing a civil action, seek a \ndetermination on the merits of the eligible complaint by the \nDepartment of Agriculture if such complaint was filed not \nlater than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.  The \nDepartment of Agriculture shall– \n  i.  provide the complainant an opportunity for a hearing \non the record before making that determination; \n  ii.  award  the  complainant  such  relief  as  would  be \nafforded under the applicable statute from which the \neligible complaint arose notwithstanding any statute of \nlimitations; and \n  iii.  to the maximum extent practicable within 180 days \nafter the date a determination of an eligible complaint \nis  sought  under  this  subsection  conduct  an \ninvestigation,  issue  a  written  determination  and \npropose  a  resolution  in  accordance  with  this \nsubsection. \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 49 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 75 of 82\n \n  c.  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if an eligible claim \nis denied administratively, the claimant shall have at least 180 \ndays to commence a cause of action in a Federal Court of \ncompetent jurisdiction seeking a review of such denial. \n \nd.  The United States Court of Federal Claims and the United \nStates District Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction \nover– \n  i.  any cause of action arising out of a complaint with \nrespect to which this section waives the statute of \nlimitations; and \n  ii.  any civil action for judicial review of a determination \nin an administrative proceeding  in the Department of \nAgriculture under this section. \n \ne.  As used in this section, the term “eligible complaint” means a \nnon-employment related complaint that was filed with the \nDepartment of Agriculture before July 1, 1997 and alleges \ndiscrimination at any time during the period beginning on \nJanuary 1, 1981 and ending December 31, 1996– \n \ni.  in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 \nU.S.C. 1691 et seq.) in administering– \n    1.  a  farm  ownership,  farm  operating,  or \nemergency loan funded from the Agriculture \nCredit Insurance Program Account; or \n    2.  a housing program established under title V of \nthe Housing Act of 1949; or \n \n  ii.  in the administration of a commodity program or \ndisaster assistance program. \n \nf.  This section shall apply in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. \n \ng.  The standard of review for judicial review of an agency \naction with respect to an eligible complaint is de novo review. \nChapter 5 of title 5 of the United States Code shall apply with \nrespect to an agency action under this section with respect to \nan eligible complaint, without regard to section 554(a)(1) of \nthat title. \n \n \nIX. \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 50 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 76 of 82\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  \n \n99.  Pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 23, and LCvR 23.1(a)(2) , the proposed class \ndefinition is as follows: \n  All African American, BLACK farmers who (1) farmed or \nattempted farm between January 1, 1997 and August 30, 2004; \nand (2) applied, or would have applied but for the rampant and \novert  USDA  discrimination,  during  that  time  period,  for \nparticipation in a federal farm program with USDA, and as a \ndirect result of a determination by USDA in response to said \napplication, believed that they were discriminated against on the \nbasis  of  race,  Black,  and  those  who  may  have  filed  a \ndiscrimination complaint in that period of time.   \n \n100.  The potential number of  Class Members is estimated to be between 5,000 and with \nNotice to putative class members the final number should or may result in somewhere between \n25,000 or more Class Members.11  With respect to the Class Members, the allegations are similar, if \nnot identical, to the allegations and causes of actions of the  Class representatives.  Simply put, each \nand every plaintiff and class representative was denied a loan or program benefit, such as a farm \nownership, farm operating or disaster loan, by DEFENDANTS, or was granted a loan or program \nbenefit on terms different than that of white farmers; said plaintiffs complained on grounds of \ndiscrimination; said discrimination complaint was never resolved pursuant to the law; and all of \nthese events occurred during the period 1997-2004. \n101.  The  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  all  class  members  is  based  on \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, US Const., 15 U.S.C. §1691, et seq.  42 U.S.C. §§  1985, 7 CFR  \n§§ 2,28, 15.52, et. seq. and 5 U.S.C. § 706 and the DEFENDANTS’ violations thereof, all to the \n                                                 \n11 The status of the approximate 70,000 late filer class members in the Pigford Class Action \nlawsuit remains to be determined by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The \nBFAA, Inc. class makes no assertion that the late filers should be or are included in their ranks.  \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 51 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 77 of 82\ndetriment of and damages to the entire class.  \n102.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, individually and collectively, arbitrarily \nand capriciously dismissed, on or about August 15, 2003, without acceptance or investigation, the \nprogram discrimination complaints of approximately 3000 class members, all in the furtherance of \nits goal to discriminate against Black farmers and to provide preferential treatment to white farmers. \n The DEFENDANTS were perpetrated with the express intent to injure Black Farmers and to deny \nBlack Farmers their rights, all to the class members’ detriment. \n  103.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, each with the other, conspired, within \nthe USDA’s Administrative Civil Rights Process, to deprive Class Members their civil rights as is \npartially evidenced by the public statements of former Assistant Secretary for Administration12 Lou \nGallegos contained in an article entitled, “Virginia Bias Case Triggers Debate”. Assistant Secretary \nGallegos’ instructive statement  follows:      \n   There’s  nothing  more  demeaning  to  humanity  than \ndiscrimination especially when it is done by your own \ngovernment . . . Gallegos said the Department’s Office of \nGeneral Counsel  pushed him to order a detailed review of \nthe (Warren) decision - in effect, an appeal.  He said that \nthe lawyers tried to offer evidence that had not been a \npart of the Court  record . . . I thought that was unseemly \n. . . The payout ($6.6 million) >was the cost of not acting \nwhen they (USDA) should have in a meaningful way.    \n \nRichmond Times Dispatch, April 3, 2003 (emphasis added).   \n104.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, each with the other, conspired to deprive \n                                                 \n \n12 The Assistant Secretary for Administration had the delegated and regulatory authority to accept \nemployee and program complaints of discrimination and to resolve such complaints for payment of \ncompensatory damages prior to the transfer of those authorities to the newly created Assistant Secretary for \nCivil Rights political position.  Gallegos resigned under pressure and dubious circumstances upon his refusal \nto follow the dictates of the OGC and the DEFENDANT SECRETARY who insisted that he reverse the ALJ 6.6 \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 52 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 78 of 82\nclass members their civil rights by secretly installing DEFENDANT TRUE, former Deputy \nAssociate General Counsel for Civil Rights, current Director of the Office of Civil Rights, when they \nhad actual notice and knew or should have known that to do so would present, and did present, a \nirrefutable conflict of interest and would violate, and did violate, the federal disciplinary rules for \nlawyers and the Canon of Ethics.  The DEFENDANTS did so with the express intent of placing an \nattorney responsible for legal defense of the DEFENDANTS in civil rights administrative claims, all \nof which she is imputed to have knowledge of by virtue of her former position, into the Directorship \nof the Office of Civil Rights where she now has the responsibility to accept, investigate and settle, if \ndiscrimination affirmed, class members’ administrative discrimination claims, all in violation of law \nand regulations and to the detriment of all class members.   \n105.  On information and belief, DEFENDANTS, each with the other, conspired to deprive \nBFAA, Inc. and Pigford late filer class members their civil rights by obstructing justice as stated in \nthe EWG report, “Obstruction of Justice: USDA Undermines Historic Civil Rights Settlement for \nBlack Farmers” which is incorporated herein as if fully stated verbatim.       \n106.  The  foregoing  allegations  are  typical  as  to  all  Class  Members.    The  Class \nRepresentatives, for themselves and members of the Class will present a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination showing (1)DEFENDANTS’ awarding of credit and farm program participation to \nwhites was a pattern different than for the Class members (2)(a) the Class Members were qualified \nfor credit, 2(b) applied for credit and (2(b) were denied credit while white farmers received credit \nwhether qualified or not, and (3) a willful failure of DEFENDANTS to accept complaints of \ndiscrimination, to properly investigate the discrimination complaints filed by PLAINTIFFS AND \n                                                                                                                                                             \nmillion dollar Warren award issued against the DEFENDANTS.   \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 53 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 79 of 82\nALL SIMILARLY SITUATED BLACK FARMERS and members of the Class, and a willful, \ncollusive  failure  to  compensate  Black  Farmers  who  had  been  discriminated  against  by  the \nDEFENDANTS, individually and collectively. \nX. \nCAUSES OF ACTION  \n \nA.  COUNT  I  -  CONSTITUTIONAL  VIOLATION  OF  THE  FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT \n107.  The Class representatives, on behalf of themselves and all Class members, re-allege \nall paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n108.

The DEFENDANTS, each with the other, have intentionally denied the Class \nRepresentatives and Members the due process of and equal protection of the laws by their willful \nconduct and callous disregard for the Class Representatives’ civil rights and liberties, all to the \ndetriment of and damages to the plaintiffs.  \nB.  COUNT II - CONSPIRACY TO INTERFERE WITH CIVIL RIGHTS \n110.

The DEFENDANTS intentionally discriminated against the Class Representatives \nand Class Members; and further, the DEFENDANTS intentionally conspired to deprive, and did \ndeprive, the Class Representatives and Members of their rights and privileges, the right to due \nprocess and equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT to \nthe United States Constitution in violation of 42 USC § 1985 (3), all to the detriment and injury to \nPlaintiffs.    \nC.

An actual controversy exists between Class representatives and Class members and \nDEFENDANTS as to their rights with respect to DEFENDANTS’ farm programs. \n114.  The Class representatives and the Class members pray that this Court declare and \ndetermine, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201, the rights of the Class members under DEFENDANTS’ farm \nprograms including their right to equal credit, participation in farm programs, and their right to full \nand timely enforcement of racial discrimination complaints. \nD.  COUNT IV – CONTINUOUS AND UNABATED VIOLATIONS OF THE ECOA \n \n115.  Class representatives, on behalf of themselves and all Class members similarly \nsituated, re-allege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n116.  DEFENDANTS’ acts of denying Class members credit and other benefits and \nsystematically failing to property process their discrimination complaints was racially discriminatory \nand contrary to the requirements of ECOA. \n \n1ST AMENDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT    PAGE 55 OF 82 \n\nCase 1:04-cv-01561-PLF   Document 16   Filed 10/22/04   Page 81 of 82\n117.
