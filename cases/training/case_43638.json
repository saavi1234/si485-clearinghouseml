Based upon the current state of discovery, Plaintiffs request 2-week extension of Plaintiffs' 5/3/2023 expert witness disclosure deadline, with corresponding 2-week extension of Defendants' expert witness disclosure deadline. Defendant Oahu Interscholastic Association (\"OIA\") does not oppose the request. Defendant Hawaii State Department of Education (\"DOE\"), however, objects and argues Plaintiffs have not demonstrated good cause supporting the requested extension. Finding good cause, and over Defendant DOE's objection, the Court EXTENDS the parties' expert witness disclosure deadlines as follows:• Plaintiffs' expert witness disclosure deadline is EXTENDED from 5/3/2023 to 5/17/2023.• Defendants expert witness disclosure deadline is EXTENDED from 6/3/2023 to 6/17/2023.All other deadlines to remain. Given the limited scope of the extension, the Court declines to issue an amended scheduling order. Parties report mediation scheduled for 7/31/2023 with Judge Milks (ret.). Court confirms Telephonic Status Conference set for 6/6/2023 at 8:30 a.m. before Magistrate Judge Trader to remain on calendar.

The Court has reviewed the draft partial transcript of 4/22/19 of said deposition which is hereby made part of the record. The Court reaffirms its prior oral ruling at the Status Conference held on 4/21/19 that discovery is to proceed on a bifurcated basis with the initial phase limited to class certification only. Given the purported class alleged in the Complaint [Docket #1] as confirmed by Plaintiffs' counsel on record and the fundamental principles which guide the tailoring of discovery to the specific needs of the case after considering factors such as, relevance, scope, issues involved and the need for the information sought at this pre-certification stage of the proceedings, the Court limits the questioning of deponent Nicole Isa-Iijima, as well as, other deponents under Rules 30(b)(1) and 30(b)(6) to matters relating to class certification only. This limitation shall continue until further order by this Court or the agreement of counsel. (Court Reporter No Record.) (MAGISTRATE JUDGE ROM TRADER)(tbf, ) Modified on 4/24/2019 (tbf, ).

          "description": "EP: Status Conference re: Discovery Dispute - (AMENDED)Kim Turner (Pro Hac Vice), Mateo Caballero and Jongwook Kim appearing by phone for Plaintiffs.John Cregor appearing by phone for Defendant (Hawaii DOE).Lyle Hosoda and Lauren Nakamura for Defendant (OIA).Discussion had concerning proffers and objections relating to the scope of deposition questions posed to Nicole Isa-Iijima on 4/22/19. The Court has reviewed the rough draft of the partial transcript of 4/22/19 of said deposition which is not filed as part of the record. The Court reaffirms its prior oral ruling at the Status Conference held on 4/21/19 that discovery is to proceed on a bifurcated basis with the initial phase limited to class certification only. Given the purported class alleged in the Complaint [Docket #1] as confirmed by Plaintiffs' counsel on record and the fundamental principles which guide the tailoring of discovery to the specific needs of the case after considering factors such as, relevance, scope, issues involved and the need for the information sought at this pre-certification stage of the proceedings, the Court limits the questioning of deponent Nicole Isa-Iijima, as well as, other deponents under Rules 30(b)(1) and 30(b)(6) to matters relating to class certification only. This limitation shall continue until further order by this Court or the agreement of counsel.Status Conference held on 4/23/2019. (Court Reporter FTR C7.)

    "summary": "<p>Two female student-athletes attending James Campbell High School filed a class action suit on December 6, 2018, against the school, the Hawai'i State Department of Education (\"DOE\"), and the Oahu Interscholastic Association (\"OIA\") in the U.S. District for the District of Hawai'i. Two more female student-athletes joined as named plaintiffs through an amended complaint filed on September 26, 2019. Plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU of Hawaii and Legal Aid at Work. The lawsuit was brought under Title IX, a federal law requiring gender equity in education, including athletics. District Judge Leslie E. Kobayashi presided over the case.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that despite being on notice of disparities between the athletic facilities for female and male student-athletes for decades, the DOE continued to prioritize upgrading facilities for male athletes over providing any facilities at all for female athletes. The OIA, which administered policies and regulations for interscholastic athletics in Oahu-based DOE schools, allegedly also discriminated against female athletes by prioritizing male athletes in scheduling games, seasons, and tournaments as well as publicizing and promoting male athletic competitions. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants for three violations of Title IX: unequal treatment and benefits in athletic programs, unequal participation opportunities in athletic programs, and retaliation by the DOE for complaints of discrimination. Plaintiffs also sought a class certification to include all current and future female student-athletes at Campbell High School.</p>\r\n<p>On January 18, 2019, the OIA filed a motion to dismiss that Judge Kobayashi denied on May 24, 2019. The OIA argued that the plaintiffs' Title IX claim was not valid as the OIA did not receive federal funds, one of the components of a Title IX claim. Judge Kobayashi disagreed and found that plaintiffs had asserted enough facts to plausibly show that the OIA was an indirect recipient of federal funds through the DOE and therefore was subject to Title IX. 386 F. Supp. 3d 1352 (D. Haw. 2019).</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on December 31, Judge Kobayashi&nbsp;denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification due to failure to satisfy the numerosity requirement and the commonality and typicality requirements for the retaliation allegation. Judge Kobayashi found that because all the members of the proposed class were students at a singular high school it would be possible to add them via joinder and that the retaliation claim was specific to one team's interactions with the school administrators at the time. 334 F.R.D. 600 (D. Haw. 2019).</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs appealed the denial on January 14, 2020. Two years later, on April 4, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the denial and remanded the case to District Court. The three-judge panel consisted of Circuit Judges Richard R. Clifton, Ryan D. Nelson, and Daniel P. Collins. The Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s opinion, written by Judge Collins, held that plaintiffs had satisfied the numerosity requirement due to their proposed class exceeding 300 people and that plaintiffs satisfied the commonality and typicality requirements for the retaliation charge due to the class-wide effect of the retaliation. 30 F.4th 828 (D. Haw. 2019).</p>\r\n<p>In light of the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s remand, the court granted class certification on July 1, 2022 and certified a class consisting of &ldquo;all present and future James Campbell High School female students and potential students who participate, seek to participate, and/or are or were deterred from participating in athletics at Campbell.&rdquo; The court subsequently reopened the case, at which time it proceeded into the discovery phase. On June 2, 2023, the parties each made cross-motions for summary judgment. Before the court could rule on the motions, however, the parties engaged in a settlement mediation on July 31, 2023 and reached an agreement in principle on key issues by August 30, 2023. The parties withdrew their motions without prejudice at that point, and the court held remaining deadlines in abeyance. The parties concluded their negotiations over material issues by September 29, 2023, but continued to engage in mediation over attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties submitted the settlement agreement over material issues for the court&rsquo;s preliminary approval on October 27, 2023, which the court granted the same day. The settlement required OIA and the DOE to ensure that athletic participation opportunities and treatment and benefits for girls at Campbell High School comply with Title IX. The settlement required the defendants to undergo monitoring to ensure their compliance for a period of 7 years, with a putative end date of October 7, 2030, which could be extended if defendants remained non-compliant by that time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The monitoring scheme required Campbell to create a Title IX complaint mechanism and appoint an independent evaluator, to be compensated by defendants. The independent evaluator was to be responsible for preparing and submitting interim and annual reports of Campbell&rsquo;s compliance with Title IX, to be posted on the OIA and DOE websites and shared with plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel. The reports were to include student population statistics relevant to Title IX as well as specified gender equality metrics. The independent evaluator was also responsible for gathering information from students and coaches, reviewing facilities, assessing complaints and their resolution, and conducting Title IX training. The settlement also contained a non-retaliation provision for anyone who cooperated with the independent evaluator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The agreement contained several provisions that applied only to OIA. The organization was required to monitor demand for new athletic opportunities for girls and take steps to offer opportunities commensurate with demand. OIA was also required to ensure that high school sports on Oahu were administered equitably and that no gender received preferential treatment in scheduling, facilities, promotional support, or travel allowances.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted final approval of the settlement on March 5, 2024, and the parties agreed to dismiss their claims with prejudice two weeks later, on March 19. The court would still have jurisdiction to enforce the settlement through 2030. The issue of attorneys' fees remained, though the parties settled that issue in late 2024.</p>\r\n<p>As of September 21, 2024, litigation has ended but the court continues to monitor enforcement.</p>",

Federal Rule of Procedure 23(e)(2) requires the Court to determine whether \nthe Settlement Agreement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” The Court may \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 331   Filed 03/05/24   Page 4 of 7  PageID.7843\nconsider the following factors in evaluating the Settlement: “the strength of \nthe plaintiffs’ case; the risk, expense, complexity, and likely duration of \nfurther litigation; the risk of maintaining class action status throughout the \ntrial; the amount offered in settlement; the extent of discovery completed \nand the stage of the proceedings; the experience and views of counsel; the \npresence of a governmental participant; and the reaction of the class \nmembers to the proposed settlement.” In re Volkswagen “Clean Diesel” \nMktg., Sales Practices, & Prod. Liab. Litig., 895 F.3d 597, 610 n.18 (9th Cir. \n2018) (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1026 (9th Cir. \n1998)). \n2.  The Court finds that the Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate, and \nreasonable in light of these factors. \na.  The Settlement Agreement reflects the strength of Plaintiffs’ case as \nwell as Defendants’ positions. This Court has been “exposed to the \nlitigants, and their strategies, positions and proof.” Officers for Justice \nv. Civil Serv. Comm’n of City & Cty. of San Francisco, 688 F.2d 615, \n626 (9th Cir. 1982) (quoting Ace Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Crane \nCo., 453 F.2d 30, 34 (3d Cir. 1971)). The “strong judicial policy that \nfavors settlements, particularly where complex class action litigation \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 331   Filed 03/05/24   Page 5 of 7  PageID.7844\nis concerned,” is applicable here. Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, \n955 F.2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir. 1992). \nb.  The Settlement Agreement was reached in arm’s length settlement \nnegotiations during a multi-day mediation conducted by retired Judge \nMarie N. Milks, an experienced mediator. \nc.  The risks, expense, complexity, and duration of litigation support \napproval. This case has been litigated for over five years. Trial of any \ncase, let alone a class action, is inherently complex and risky. The \nSettlement Agreement is far preferable to the risk, costs, and expense \nof further litigation against Defendants, one of which is a \ngovernmental participant.  \nd.  The extent of discovery completed supports approval. Discovery \nincluded tens of thousands of pages of documents, more than twenty \ndepositions across two separate time periods, expert testimony, and \nmultiple site visits. Because extensive discovery had been completed \nand the Action was nearing trial, the Court and the parties have \nsufficient information to make an informed decision that settlement is \nappropriate. \ne.  The experience and views of counsel weigh in favor of approval. \nClass Counsel have extensive experience in Title IX litigation and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 331   Filed 03/05/24   Page 6 of 7  PageID.7845\nadvocacy. Class Counsel’s strong qualifications and experience have \nserved class members throughout this litigation. With Class Counsel’s \nprior expertise and work on this case, Counsel have developed a \nrobust understanding of the legal issues present and rightly evaluated \nthe strengths and weaknesses of Plaintiffs’ case. Class Counsel’s \nexperience and knowledge ensures that Class Counsel’s judgment is \nreliable in determining the proposed Settlement Agreement is fair, \nadequate, and reasonable. \nf.  Finally, the reaction of class members supports final approval of the \nSettlement Agreement. The fact that zero class members objected to \nthe Settlement Agreement following class notice strongly supports the \nfairness of the Agreement. \n3.  The parties have requested final approval of the Settlement Agreement while \nthe issue of attorneys’ fees and costs remains pending before Judge Rom A. \nTrader. The fees and costs issue will be addressed separately by the Court. \nThe Court finds no reason to postpone final approval of the Settlement \nAgreement until after that issue has been resolved. \n4.  In light of the above, the Court finds that the Settlement Agreement, \nincluding Exhibit A (Compliance Plan) and Exhibit B (Additional Specific \nTerms, Oahu Interscholastic Association), attached hereto as Exhibit 1, is \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 331   Filed 03/05/24   Page 7 of 7  PageID.7846\nfair, reasonable, and adequate within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23, and GRANTS final approval of the Settlement Agreement and \nall of the terms and conditions contained therein. \n5.  By this order, the Court incorporates the terms of the attached Settlement \nAgreement and maintains exclusive and continuing jurisdiction in this matter \nuntil October 7, 2030, unless otherwise ordered by the Court as provided by \nthe Settlement Agreement. \n6.  The Parties are directed to implement the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement. \n    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n    Dated:  Honolulu, Hawai(cid:1931)i, March 5, 2024. \n \n5",

AND D.B., AND T.   \nT., BY HER PARENTS AND NEXT   \nFRIENDS, K.T. AND S.T.,   \n \nPlaintiffs,  \n \n  vs.  \n \nHAWAII STATE DEPARTMENT OF \nEDUCATION, and OAHU \nINTERSCHOLASTIC ASSOCIATION, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n    On May 3, 2019, Plaintiffs A.B., by her parents and \nnext friends, C.B. and D.B.; and T.T., by her parents and next \nfriends, K.T. and S.T. (“Plaintiffs”), filed their Motion for \nClass Certification (“Motion”).  [Dkt. no. 59.]  Defendant Oahu \nInterscholastic Association (“OIA”) filed a memorandum in \nopposition (“OIA Opposition”) on August 29, 2019 and Defendant \nHawaii State Department of Education (“DOE”) filed a substantive \njoinder in the OIA Opposition and its memorandum in opposition \n(“DOE Opposition”) on August 30, 2019.1  [Dkt. nos. 102, 104.]  \nPlaintiffs filed their reply on September 6, 2019.  [Dkt. \n                     \n  1 The DOE and the OIA are referred to collectively as \n“Defendants.” \n\nno. 108.]  This matter came on for hearing on September 19, \n2019.  On September 26, 2019, the DOE and Plaintiffs filed their \nrespective supplemental memoranda.  [Dkt. nos. 114, 117.]  On \nOctober 3, 2019, the DOE, Plaintiffs, and the OIA filed \nresponses to the supplemental memoranda.  [Dkt. nos. 120, 121, \n122.]  For the reasons stated below, the Motion is denied. \nBACKGROUND \n    The operative pleading at this time is the \nSeptember 26, 2019 Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and \nInjunctive Relief (“Second Amended Complaint”).2  [Dkt. no. 116.]  \nPlaintiff A.B. is a seventeen year-old, twelfth-grade student at \nJames Campbell High School (“Campbell”), who is a member of the \nCampbell girls’ varsity water polo and swimming teams.  \nPlaintiff A.M.B. is a fourteen year-old, ninth-grade student at \nCampbell, who is a member of the Campbell girls’ varsity water \npolo team.  Plaintiff T.T. is also a seventeen year-old, \ntwelfth-grade student at Campbell, who is a member of the \n                     \n  2 The Motion was filed before the First Amended Complaint \nfor Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“First Amended \nComplaint”), [filed 6/20/19 (dkt. no. 88),] and the Second \nAmended Complaint.  Because the differences between the \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“Complaint”), \nFirst Amended Complaint, and Second Amended Complaint do not \naffect class certification, this Court construes the Motion as \naddressing the Second Amended Complaint.  Therefore, \n“Plaintiffs” includes Plaintiffs A.M.B., by her parents and next \nfriends, C.B. and D.B.; and A.P., by her parents and next \nfriends, C.P. and M.P. \n2 \n \n\nCampbell girls’ varsity water polo and swimming teams.  \nPlaintiff.  Plaintiff A.P. is a sixteen year-old, eleventh-grade \nstudent at Campbell, who is a member of the girls’ varsity \nsoccer and water polo teams.  [Id. at ¶¶ 11-14.]   \n    According to the Second Amended Complaint, the DOE is \na state administrative agency that manages 292 public schools \nwithin the State of Hawai`i, including Campbell, which is a \nfour-year high school.  Plaintiffs allege the DOE receives \nfederal financial assistance and is subject to the anti-\ndiscrimination provisions of Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.  [Id. \nat ¶ 15.]  The OIA “is an unincorporated athletic association \ncomposed of all of the DOE’s secondary schools on the island of \nOahu,” including Campbell.  [Id. at ¶ 16.]  Plaintiffs allege \nboth that the OIA is an “instrumentality of, and is controlled \nby, the DOE,” and that the DOE and the OIA are “pervasively \nentwined” because “[t]he OIA’s Executive Director is a DOE \nemployee, and all five regular members of the OIA’s Executive \nCouncil are principals of DOE high schools.”  [Id. at ¶¶ 16-17.]  \nBecause of the OIA’s connections with the DOE, Plaintiffs allege \nit receives federal financial assistance, and is therefore \nsubject to the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX.  [Id. \nat ¶ 18.]   \n3 \n \n\n    Campbell is the largest high school in the DOE by \npopulation.  In the 2017-18 school year, of the 3,123 students, \n1,506 were female.  [Id. at ¶ 51.]  Plaintiffs allege: female \nathletes at Campbell suffer worse treatment, receive fewer \nbenefits, and have fewer opportunities than male athletes; and \nthe OIA’s policies and practices control and/or greatly \ninfluence this disparate treatment.  [Id. at ¶¶ 52-53.]  With \nregard to the DOE, Plaintiffs allege sex-based discrimination in \nits administration of:  \n(i) athletic locker rooms,[3] practice facilities, \nand competitive facilities; (ii) equipment and \nsupplies; (iii) scheduling of games and practice \ntimes; (iv) availability and quality of coaching; \n(v) travel opportunities; (vi) medical and \ntraining services and facilities; and \n(vii) publicity and promotion. \n \n[Id. at ¶ 57.]  With regard to the OIA, Plaintiffs allege \ndiscrimination is evidenced by its treatment of the girls’ teams \nwith respect to: “(i) competitive facilities; (ii) scheduling of \ngames; (iv)  [sic] travel opportunities; and (iv) publicity and \npromotion.”  [Id. at ¶ 58.] \n    Plaintiffs allege they have submitted numerous \ncomplaints to the DOE regarding unfair treatment, and have made \n                     \n  3 According to the Second Amended Complaint, an “athletic \nlocker room” refers to a school’s stand-alone athletic locker \nroom facility that is usually located near the school’s outdoor \nsports facilities, such as track and field, cross-country, \nfootball, baseball, and soccer fields.  [Second Amended \nComplaint at ¶ 59 n.16.]  \n4 \n \n\nwritten and oral requests to obtain equal accommodation and/or \nto engage in discussions with the DOE regarding the same.  [Id. \nat ¶¶ 158-59.]  In response, the DOE and Campbell administrators \nhave allegedly retaliated against Plaintiffs by, inter alia, \nthreatening to cancel the Campbell girls’ water polo season, \neliminate the team, or both; and increasing administrative \nburdens on the water polo team, such as forcing the team to \nresubmit program paperwork after a particularly heated meeting \nbetween the water polo athletes, their parents, and Campbell \nadministrators.  [Id. at ¶ 161-62.] \n    Plaintiffs have alleged the following claims: 1) a \nviolation of Title IX against Defendants based on their failure \nto take remedial actions to meet the anti-discrimination \nprovisions under Title IX, and their continued unequal treatment \nof female athletes at Campbell (“Count I”); 2) a violation of \nTitle IX against Defendants based on their failure to provide \nCampbell female athletes with equivalent athletic participation \nopportunities (“Count II”); and 3) a violation of Title IX \nagainst the DOE based on the DOE’s retaliation for Plaintiffs’ \nattempts to report and/or discuss the DOE’s practice of sex \ndiscrimination (“Count III”). \n    The Motion proposes the following class of plaintiffs: \n“All present and future James Campbell High School (‘Campbell’) \nfemale students and potential students who participate, seek to \n5 \n \n\nparticipate, and/or were deterred from participating in \nathletics at Campbell.”  [Motion at 1.]  Plaintiffs assert the \nproposed class satisfies the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a), (b)(1)(B) and (b)(2).  Plaintiffs ask this Court to \ncertify them as class representatives.  Plaintiffs also move to \nhave their counsel appointed as class counsel under Rule 23(g). \nSTANDARD \n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 states, in pertinent part: \n(a)  Prerequisites.  One or more members of a \nclass may sue or be sued as representative \nparties on behalf of all members only if: \n \n(1)  the class is so numerous that joinder \nof all members is impracticable; \n \n(2)  there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class; \n \n(3)  the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and \n \n(4)  the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the \nclass. \n \nThe Rule 23(a) requirements are known as: “(1) numerosity; \n(2) commonality; (3) typicality; and (4) adequacy of \nrepresentation.”  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 674 (9th Cir. \n2014). \n    “Class certification is proper only if the trial court \nhas concluded, after a ‘rigorous analysis,’ that Rule 23(a) has \nbeen satisfied.”  Id. (some citations and internal quotation \n6 \n \n\nmarks omitted) (quoting Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, --- U.S. \n---, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011)).  The \nclass action is “an exception to the usual rule that litigation \nis conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties \nonly.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 348 (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  The Ninth Circuit has stated: \n  In evaluating whether a party has met the \nrequirements of Rule 23, we recognize that \n“Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading \nstandard.”  Wal–Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.  We \ntherefore require a party seeking class \ncertification to “affirmatively demonstrate his \ncompliance with the Rule — that is, he must be \nprepared to prove that there are in fact \nsufficiently numerous parties, common questions \nof law or fact, etc.”  Id.  Similarly a party \nmust affirmatively prove that he complies with \none of the three subsections of Rule 23(b). \n \nParsons, 754 F.3d at 674 (emphasis in Parsons). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Mootness and Standing \n  A.  Mootness \n    As a threshold matter, Defendants argue Plaintiffs \nA.B. and T.T.’s claims are unsustainable as moot.4  [OIA Opp. at \n                     \n  4 Defendants argue Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring \ntheir claims.  See OIA Opp. at 9-14; DOE Opp. at 2; 9/19/19 hrg. \ntrans., filed 10/7/19 (dkt. no. 124), at 9-13, 15-17.  However, \nthe substance of Defendants’ arguments purportedly addressing \nstanding actually address mootness, or another Rule 23 \nrequirement, such as adequate representation.  See, e.g., OIA \nOpp. at 11 (arguing “Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. lack standing” \nbecause they had both graduated from Campbell and therefore did \n                  (. . . continued) \n7 \n \n\n11; DOE Opp. at 2.]  Defendants argue that, because A.B. and \nT.T. have graduated from Campbell since filing the Motion, they \nno longer qualify as members of the proposed class, and \ntherefore cannot pursue their claims.  [OIA Opp. at 11.]  It is \ntrue that, if “the plaintiff’s claim becomes moot before the \ndistrict court certifies the class, the class action normally \nalso becomes moot.”  Slayman v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., \n765 F.3d 1033, 1048 (9th Cir. 2014).  However, under the \n“inherently transitory” exception to mootness, a court may \n“avoid[] the spectre of plaintiffs filing lawsuit after lawsuit, \nonly to see their claims mooted before they can be resolved.”  \nPitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc., 653 F.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. \n2011).  “‘Some claims are so inherently transitory that the \ntrial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion \nfor class certification before the proposed representative’s \nindividual interest expires.’”  Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting \nCty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52, 111 S. Ct. \n1661 (1991)).  An inherently transitory claim is one in which a \ntrial court will not have enough time to rule before the \nexpiration of the representative’s interest, yet “will certainly \nrepeat as to the class, either because ‘[t]he individual could \n                     \nnot qualify as members of the proposed class).  Therefore, the \nCourt has construed certain arguments addressing standing to be \narguments that A.B. and T.T. cannot pursue their claims due to \nmootness in light of their graduation from Campbell. \n8 \n \n\nnonetheless suffer repeated [harm]’ or because ‘it is certain \nthat other persons similarly situated’ will have the same \ncomplaint.”  Id. (alterations in Pitts) (quoting Gerstein v. \nPugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110 n.11, 95 S. Ct. 854 (1975)). \n    Given the necessarily finite duration of a high school \nstudent’s time as a student-athlete, and the potential for \nrepetition of the claims from similarly situated students, under \nthe particular circumstances of this case, these claims are \ninherently transitory.  Furthermore, “[t]here is nothing to be \ngained by denying class certification only for class members to \nfile a new lawsuit to be included in this litigation.”  In re \nNat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap \nAntitrust Litig., 311 F.R.D. 532, 539 (N.D. Cal. 2015).  \nTherefore, the inherently transitory exception to mootness \napplies to the Plaintiffs who have already graduated from \nCampbell.  Plaintiffs who have not yet graduated have also been \nto the Second Amended Complaint.  Defendants’ arguments as to \nmootness are therefore denied. \n  B.  Standing \n    The OIA objects to class certification on the grounds \nthat Plaintiff A.M.B, a fourteen year-old, ninth grade water \npolo player, does not have standing because water polo season \nhad not yet begun at the time the Motion was filed.  The OIA, \njoined by the DOE, argue A.M.B.’s injuries are dissimilar from \n9 \n \n\nthe other named Plaintiffs in that, because A.M.B.’s inaugural \nyear as a student-athlete at Campbell had not yet begun, she had \nnot experienced the operative alleged discriminatory conduct.  \nThe OIA argues further that her injuries were, at the time the \nMotion was filed, hypothetical, and because A.M.B had not yet \nexperienced the injury alleged herself, she is not a member of \nthe proposed class, and therefore lacks standing to represent \nthe proposed class.  \n    The principles of standing are well established.  The \nUnited States Supreme Court has held: \n  It is axiomatic that the judicial power \nconferred by Art. III may not be exercised unless \nthe plaintiff shows “that he personally has \nsuffered some actual or threatened injury as a \nresult of the putatively illegal conduct of the \ndefendant.”  Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of \nBellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979).  It is not \nenough that the conduct of which the plaintiff \ncomplains will injure someone.  The complaining \nparty must also show that he is within the class \nof persons who will be concretely affected.  Nor \ndoes a plaintiff who has been subject to \ninjurious conduct of one kind possess by virtue \nof that injury the necessary stake in litigating \nconduct of another kind, although similar, to \nwhich he has not been subject.  See Moose Lodge \nNo. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 166-167 (1972). \n \nBlum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 999 (1982) (emphasis in \noriginal).  This principle still applies when the case is \nbrought as a putative class action.  Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. \n343, 357 (1996).  “[E]ven named plaintiffs who represent a class \nmust allege and show that they personally have been injured, not \n10 \n \n\nthat injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of \nthe class to which they belong and which they purport to \nrepresent.”  Id. (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); see also Hawkins v. Comparet-Cassani, 251 F.3d 1230, \n1238 (9th Cir. 2001) (“A named plaintiff cannot represent a \nclass alleging constitutional claims that the named plaintiff \ndoes not have standing to raise.” (citing O’Shea v. Littleton, \n414 U.S. 488, 493-94, 94 S. Ct. 669, 38 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1974))). \n    Defendants focus on the water-polo and locker room \naccess allegations in arguing against A.M.B. as a class \nrepresentative on the basis of standing.  See OIA Opp. at 12 \n(arguing Campbell did not have a pool for boys or girls to \ncompete in, and that Campbell cured locker room disparity before \nA.M.B. was officially a student-athlete).  However, Plaintiffs’ \nallegations of discrimination go far beyond the pool and locker \nroom.  Plaintiffs allege a lack of locker room and pool access \nas only part of their evidence supporting their three causes of \naction. \n    This district court has utilized a three-part test in \ndetermining whether a plaintiff has standing.  \nIn order to establish standing, three \nrequirements must be met: \n \nFirst and foremost, there must be alleged \n(and ultimately proved) an injury in fact – \na harm suffered by the plaintiff that is \nconcrete and actual or imminent, not \n11 \n \n\nconjectural or hypothetical.  Second, there \nmust be causation – a fairly traceable \nconnection between the plaintiff’s injury \nand the complained-of conduct of the \ndefendant.  And third, there must be \nredressability – a likelihood that the \nrequested relief will redress the alleged \ninjury.  This triad of injury in fact, \ncausation, and redressability constitutes \nthe core of Article III’s case-or-\ncontroversy requirement, and the party \ninvoking federal jurisdiction bears the \nburden of establishing its existence. \n \n[Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 \nU.S. 83, 103-04, (1998)] (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted).  See Takhar v. Kessler, \n76 F.3d 995, 1000 (9th Cir. 1996) (“A plaintiff \nhas the burden of establishing the elements \nrequired for standing.”). \n \nIinuma v. Bank of Am., N.A., Civil No. 14-00295 DKW-KSC, 2014 WL \n5361315, at *2 (D. Hawai`i Oct. 20, 2014).  \n    Therefore, Defendants’ focus on whether A.M.B. was \nsubjected to pool and locker room discrimination is an \nerroneously narrow interpretation of standing.  The alleged \ninjury is that of discrimination on the basis of sex, and \nPlaintiffs contend there are multiple instances of such \ndiscrimination.  Here, A.M.B. was allegedly subjected to at \nleast some of the instances of alleged discrimination.  \nSpecifically, A.M.B. allegedly experienced discriminatory events \ngenerally suffered by the female-student athlete population, \nwhich would apply even if a particular student’s athletic season \nhad not started at the time the Motion was filed.  See Second \n12 \n \n\nAmended Complaint at ¶ 102-11(unequal scheduling of practices \nand games between boys’ teams and girls’ teams); id. ¶ 141 \n(unequal publicity and promotion between boys’ teams and girls’ \nteams).   Student-athletes who are forced to make plans around a \ndiscriminatory sports schedule, or exposed to a lack of \npublicity for female athletics programs, are subjected to the \ntype of harm Title IX was implemented to prevent and remedy.  \nSee, e.g., Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 858 F. \nSupp. 2d 1093, 1111-12 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (finding that \ndisparities in scheduling and publicity were not negligible), \nenforced, Civil No. 07CV714-L (JMA), 2014 WL 1028431 (S.D. Cal. \nMar. 17, 2014), and aff’d, 768 F.3d 843 (9th Cir. 2014).  \nTherefore, for the purpose of the instant Motion: A.M.B. has \nstanding; the alleged injury was caused by Defendants; and the \nrequested relief is likely to redress the alleged injury.  \nTherefore, Defendants’ argument that A.M.B. lacks standing is \ndenied as to Counts I and II.  As Plaintiffs have not satisfied \nRule 23(a), see infra, it is unnecessary for the Court to reach \nthe issue of whether A.M.B. has standing to bring Count III. \nII.  Rule 23 Requirements \n  A.  Numerosity \n    The numerosity analysis is applicable to Counts I, II \nand III.  A proposed class must be “so numerous that joinder of \nall members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  “Joinder \n13 \n \n\nneed not be impossible, as long as potential class members would \nsuffer a strong litigation hardship or inconvenience if joinder \nwere required.”  Rannis v. Recchia, 380 F. App’x 646, 650–51 \n(9th Cir. 2010) (citing Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine Estates, \nInc., 329 F.2d 909, 913–14 (9th Cir. 1964)).  This Court has \ndescribed the general principles governing the numerosity \nanalysis as follows: \nThe numerosity inquiry “requires examination of \nthe specific facts of each case and imposes no \nabsolute limitations.”  Gen. Tel. Co. of the Nw., \nInc. v. E.E.O.C., 446 U.S. 318, 330, 100 S. Ct. \n1698, 64 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1980).  Courts, however, \nhave found the numerosity requirement to be \nsatisfied when a class includes at least 40 \nmembers.  See Consol. Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde \nPark, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995) (noting \nthat “numerosity is presumed at a level of 40 \nmembers”) (citation omitted); In re Nat’l W. Life \nIns. Deferred Annuities Litig., 268 F.R.D. 652, \n660 (S.D. Cal. 2010) (noting that “[c]ourts have \nfound joinder impracticable in cases involving as \nfew as forty class members”) (citations omitted); \nE.E.O.C. v. Kovacevich “5” Farms, No. CV-F-06-165 \nOWW/TAG, 2007 WL 1174444, at *21 (E.D. Cal. \nApr. 19, 2007) (noting that “[c]ourts have \nroutinely found the numerosity requirement \nsatisfied when the class comprises 40 or more \nmembers”); Ikonen v. Hartz Mountain Corp., 122 \nF.R.D. 258, 262 (S.D. Cal. 1988) (noting that \n“[a]s a general rule, classes of 20 are too \nsmall, classes of 20-40 may or may not be big \nenough depending on the circumstances of each \ncase, and classes of 40 or more are numerous \nenough”). \n \nBrown v. Porter McGuire Kiakona & Chow, LLP, CIVIL 17-00554 LEK-\nKSC, 2019 WL 254658, at *9 (D. Hawai`i Jan. 17, 2019) \n(alterations in Brown) (some citations omitted).  However, \n14 \n \n\nnumerosity has been found lacking in a proposed class with over \n300 members.  See Minersville Coal Co. v. Anthracite Export \nAss’n, 55 F.R.D. 426, 428 (M.D. Pa. 1971). \n    The analysis to determine the practicality of joinder \nis multifactored. \nJoinder of a small group may prove impracticable, \nwhile joinder of a large group may be more \npossible.  Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., 780 \nF.2d 124, 130 (1st Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 \nU.S. 1172, 106 S. Ct. 2896, 90 L. Ed. 2d 983 \n(1986).  Joinder is generally considered more \npracticable when all members of the class are \nfrom the same geographic area.  Andrews, 780 F.2d \nat 132 (citing Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & Co., \n651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981); Dale \n[Elecs., Inc. v. R.C.L. Elecs., Inc.], 53 F.R.D. \n[531,] 534 [(D.N.H. 1971)]).  Where class members \nmay be easily identified, joinder is also more \npracticable.  Id. (citing Garcia v. Gloor, 618 \nF.2d 264, 267 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 \nU.S. 1113, 101 S. Ct. 923, 66 L. Ed. 2d 842 \n(1981)). \n \nHum v. Dericks, 162 F.R.D. 628, 634 (D. Hawai`i 1995). \n    Plaintiffs argue the numerosity requirement of \nRule 23(a) is met because the proposed class is so numerous, \nbased on the number5 of female student-athletes alone, that \njoinder is impracticable.  [Mem. in Supp. of Motion at 26-27.]  \nPlaintiffs further argue that numerosity is satisfied because \n                     \n  5 Plaintiffs allege there were 366 Campbell female student-\nathletes in the 2018-19 school year, as calculated by \nPlaintiffs’ counsel from information received from DOE in \ndiscovery.  [Pltfs.’ Suppl. Mem., Decl. of Kim Turner (“Turner \nDecl.”) at ¶¶ 13-14, Exh. G (Participation Data calculated by \nPltf.’s counsel) at 3.] \n15 \n \n\nthe future members of the proposed class are necessarily \nunidentifiable, which renders joinder impracticable.  [Id. at \n27.] \nNonetheless, although the number of members in the proposed \nclass may exceed 300, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that \njoinder would be impracticable.  The proposed class members are \nlimited to the female student population from a single high \nschool.  The proposed class members are geographically tied to \none area of Hawai`i, and identifiable through school and \nathletic records.  See Hum, 162 F.R.D. at 634 (“Because most of \nthe proposed class members reside in Hawai`i and are \nidentifiable through [the defendant’s] records, the court finds \nthat [the plaintiff] has not carried his burden of showing that \njoinder is impracticable.”).  Plaintiffs have not demonstrated \nwhy joinder here is impracticable as to current students.  \n    Although future and potential students are listed \nseparately in the class description, both subgroups are subject \nto the same fatal flaw, neither is reasonably identifiable.  \nThis Court has stated: \nA class must meet a minimum level of \nidentifiability and definiteness.  See Rhodes [v. \nCracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.,], 213 \nF.R.D. [619,] 674 [(N.D. Ga. 2003)] (“Although \n[i]t is not necessary that the members of the \nclass be so clearly identified that any member \ncan be presently ascertained, . . . [Plaintiffs] \nmust establish that there exists a legally \ndefinable class that can be ascertained through \n16 \n \n\nreasonable effort.” (citation and quotation marks \nomitted) (alterations in original)).  Thus, a \ncourt should only consider potential future class \nmembers if the court can make a reasonable \napproximation of their number.  See Bethesda \nLutheran Homes & Servs., Inc. v. Leean, 165 \nF.R.D. 87, 88 (W.D. Wisc. 1996); Dudo v. \nSchaffer, 82 F.R.D. 695, 699 (E.D. Penn. 1979). \n \nR.G. v. Koller, No. 05-00566 JMSLEK, 2006 WL 897578, at *5 (D. \nHawai`i Mar. 16, 2006) (some alterations in original).  The \nCourt is currently unable to make a reasonable approximation of \nthe future and potential class members.  Therefore, future and \npotential class members will not be considered in making a \nnumerosity determination under Rule 23(a).  Plaintiffs have \nshown no sound reason why joinder is impracticable and therefore \nhave not demonstrated satisfaction of the Rule 23(a) numerosity \nrequirement. \n  B.  Commonality and Typicality \n    This district court has stated: \n  “Commonality exists where class members’ \nsituations share a common issue of law or fact, \nand are sufficiently parallel to insure a \nvigorous and full presentation of all claims for \nrelief.”  Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., LLC, \n617 F.3d 1168, 1172 (9th Cir. 2010).  Typicality \nis satisfied where the representative parties’ \nclaims and class members’ claims arise “from the \nsame course of events, and each class member \nmakes similar legal arguments to prove the \ndefendant’s liability.”  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 \nF.3d 1105, 1124 (9th Cir. 2010); Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a).  The Ninth Circuit has noted that the \n“commonality and typicality requirements of \nFRCP 23(a) tend to merge.”  Meyer v. Portfolio \n17 \n \n\nRecovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1041 (9th \nCir. 2012). \n \nJ.E. v. Wong, CIV. NO. 14-00399 HG-BMK, 2016 WL 1060834, at *2 \n(D. Hawai`i Mar. 17, 2016). \n    The Supreme Court has held commonality is “the rule \nrequiring a plaintiff to show that ‘there are questions of law \nor fact common to the class.’”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349 \n(quoting Rule 23(a)(2)).  It is not enough that all members of \nthe proposed class claim the same type of injury, rather, their \nclaims must depend on a common contention.  Id. at 349-50.  The \ncommon contention “must be of such a nature that it is capable \nof classwide resolution - which means that determination of its \ntruth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id. at 350.  \nFactual divergence among members of the proposed class to a \nsufficient degree can preclude a finding of commonality because \n“[d]issimilarities within the proposed class are what have the \npotential to impede the generation of common answers.”  Id.  \n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \n    Here, Plaintiffs offer two questions to demonstrate \nthey have satisfied the Rule 23(a) commonality requirement: \n“(1) whether Defendants unlawfully discriminate against current \nand future female athletes by failing to provide them with equal \nopportunities, treatment, and benefits, and (2) whether they \n18 \n \n\nhave been retaliated against for raising their concerns.”  [Mem. \nin Supp. of Motion at 29.] \n    For purposes of the instant Motion, proof of \ncommonality overlaps with Plaintiffs’ substantive contention \nthat Defendants engaged in discriminatory behavior.  Therefore, \na commonality determination requires identification of the \nallegations of misconduct and review of the allegations in light \nof the commonality standard.  In support of an affirmative \nresponse to their first question, Plaintiffs allege: 1) female \nstudent-athletes did not have access to the only athletic locker \nroom until the month the instant action was filed; 2) a lack of \npool access for the water polo team, and inadequate quality of \nthe pool; 3) a softball facility inferior in quality to the \nbaseball facility; 4) more difficulty getting lights at the \nsoftball facility fixed compared to the football facility; \n5) the fact that the weight room is predominantly filled with \nmale athletes every fall; 6) displacement of female water polo \nplayers in the weight room by male football players; 7) the use \nof Aloha Stadium for boys’ championship games but not for girls’ \nchampionship games; 8) less equipment funding for girls’ teams \nthan boys’ teams; 9) the scheduling of games and practices on \nmore desirable days for boys’ teams than girls’ teams; 10) that \nCampbell did not secure a coach for the girls’ water polo team \nas timely as coaches are secured for boys’ teams, and gave \n19 \n \n\nfunding from water polo to football to support the boys’ \ncoaches; 11) a lack of knowledgeable medical staff at water polo \ngames; 12) travel opportunities given to boys’ teams but not \ngirls’ teams; 13) all publicity photos on the school website \nrelated to athletics are of the football team, with no photos of \nany female student-athletes; 14) that cheerleading and band only \nperform at football games and related events and no girls’ \nsports events; 15) Campbell’s athletic director only attended \none water polo game and disparaged the team thereafter for \nlosing; and 16) at an athletic award ceremony, and again at a \npep rally, Campbell did not mention the water polo team when \ndiscussing Campbell athletics.  [Mem. in Supp. of Motion at 12-\n23.] \n    Plaintiffs assert they have answered the litigation-\ndriving “why was I disfavored” question posed by Wal-Mart with \nthe response, they were disfavored because of their gender.  See \n564 U.S. at 352 (emphasis omitted).  Although the individual \nmembers of the proposed class offer less than identical facts to \nsupport this assertion, the commonality requirement does not \ndemand that every question of law or fact be common to every \nmember of the proposed class.  See Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. Co., \n765 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir. 2014) (“These common questions may \ncenter on shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates \nor a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal \n20 \n \n\nremedies.” (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  Plaintiff’s allegations numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, \n12, and 13 present, without a determination on the merits, \nevidence of at least one question of law or fact common among \nthe proposed class, readily identifiable as an allegation of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.  No determination has been \nmade with respect to the other allegations.  Therefore, with \nregard to their first question of commonality, Plaintiffs have \nsuccessfully identified a legal issue connecting the proposed \nclass members, unequal treatment suffered on the basis of sex, \nas substantially related to the resolution of the litigation.  \nSee, e.g., Yslava v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 845 F. Supp. 705, 712-\n13 (D. Ariz. 1993) (finding commonality notwithstanding certain \nfactual variations). \n    On the question of typicality, this district court has \nstated: \n  Rule 23(a)(3) permits certification only if \n“the claims or defenses of the representative \nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of \nthe class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “The \npurpose of the typicality requirement is to \nassure that the interest of the named \nrepresentative aligns with the interests of the \nclass.”  Hanon [v. Dataproducts Corp.], 976 F.2d \n[497,] 508 [(9th Cir. 1992)] (citation omitted).  \nTypicality exists “if [representative claims] are \nreasonably coextensive with those of absent class \nmembers; they need not be substantially \nidentical.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d \n1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998), overruled on other \ngrounds by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 \n21 \n \n\nU.S. 338 (2011).  Thus, “[s]ome degree of \nindividuality is to be expected in all cases, but \nthat specificity does not necessarily defeat \ntypicality.”  Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 509 F.3d \n1168, 1184 (9th Cir. 2007), overruled on other \ngrounds by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. 338.  \nWith these principles in mind, “[t]he test of \ntypicality is whether other members have the same \nor similar injury, whether the action is based on \nconduct which is not unique to the named \nplaintiffs, and whether other class members have \nbeen injured by the same course of conduct.”  \nHanon, 976 F.2d at 508 (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted). \n \nSmith v. Bank of Haw., No. CV 16-00513 JMS-WRP, 2019 WL 2712262, \nat *2 (D. Hawai`i June 28, 2019) (some alterations in Smith), \npermission to appeal denied, No. 19-80085, 2019 WL 5190924 (9th \nCir. Sept. 17, 2019). \n    On the issue of typicality, with respect to Counts I \nand II, Plaintiffs have identified an injury, based on the \nDefendants’ actions, which is not unique to the named \nPlaintiffs.  Unequal access, treatment, and benefits of athletic \nprograms is a common injury among the named Plaintiffs and \nproposed class, therefore satisfying typicality.  \n    However, as to the second question, whether the \nproposed class was retaliated against as alleged in Count III, \nPlaintiffs’ evidence falls short.  The question of retaliation \nin the instant case also exemplifies an instance where the \ncommonality and typicality requirements merge.  The evidence \npresented by Plaintiffs in support of the claim that all \n22 \n \n\ncurrent, future, and potential female student-athletes have \nexperienced retaliation arise from a dispute between Defendants, \nspecifically limited to Campbell administrators, and the water \npolo team and their parents.  See Mem. in Supp. of Motion at 23-\n25.  Plaintiffs do not allege any instances of retaliation \nagainst any athletes other than members of the water polo team.  \nThe claim of retaliation does not arise from a fact pattern \ntypical of the absent class members, that is, there are no \nquestions of law or fact common among the proposed class.  Also, \nthe conduct complained is not typical of the proposed class; it \nis unique to the named Plaintiffs.  Therefore, retaliation, as \nalleged, cannot be found to extend to all current, future, and \npotential female student-athletes at Campbell.  Plaintiffs have \nnot satisfied the Rule 23(a) commonality and typicality \nrequirements with respect to Count III. \n  C.  Adequacy \n    The Ninth Circuit has stated: \n  “The adequacy [of representation] inquiry \nunder Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts \nof interest between named parties and the class \nthey seek to represent.”  Amchem [Prods., Inc. v. \nWindsor], 521 U.S. [591,] 625, 117 S. Ct. 2231 \n[(1997)].  Serious conflicts of interest can \nimpair adequate representation by the named \nplaintiffs, yet leave absent class members bound \nto the final judgment, thereby violating due \nprocess.  See Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d \n1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing Hansberry v. \nLee, 311 U.S. 32, 42-43, 61 S. Ct. 115, 85 L. Ed. \n22 (1940)). \n23 \n \n\n \n  The initial inquiry in assessing adequacy of \nrepresentation, then, is whether “the named \nplaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts \nof interest with other class members.”  Id. at \n1020.  That general standard must be broken down \nfor specific application; conflicts within \nclasses come in many guises.  For example, two \nsubgroups may have differing, even adversarial, \ninterests in the allocation of limited settlement \nfunds.  See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 626, 117 S. Ct. \n2231.  Class members with higher-value claims may \nhave interests in protecting those claims from \nclass members with much weaker ones, see Ortiz v. \nFibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 857, 119 S. Ct. \n2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999), or from being \ncompromised by a class representative with lesser \ninjuries who may settle more valuable claims \ncheaply, see Molski v. Gleich, 318 F.3d 937, 955 \n(9th Cir. 2003), overruled en banc on other \ngrounds by Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 \nF.3d 571 (9th Cir. 2010), rev’d, 564 U.S. 338, \n131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011). . . . \n \nIn re Volkswagen “Clean Diesel” Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. \nLiab. Litig., 895 F.3d 597, 607-08 (9th Cir. 2018) (some \nalterations in Volkswagen) (footnotes omitted), cert. denied sub \nnom., Fleshman v. Volkswagen, AG, 139 S. Ct. 2645 (2019). \n    The OIA argues the named Plaintiffs are inadequate \nrepresentatives of the proposed class because there is an \ninherent conflict between the groups that play different sports \nwithin the class, and the named Plaintiffs, all of whom only \nparticipate in swimming and water polo.6  [OIA Opp. at 16.]  The \n                     \n  6 The OIA’s Opposition was filed before A.P. was added as a \nplaintiff.  The OIA’s objection has been construed as an \nargument the named Plaintiff’s are predominantly water polo \nplayers.  \n24 \n \n\nOIA argues that, faced with limited resources, the interests of \none group within the proposed class could be antagonistic to \nanother group.  See id.  This argument has been presented to, \nand rejected by, other courts facing questions of speculative \nconflict.  See Cummings v. Connell, 316 F.3d 886, 896 (9th Cir. \n2003) (“Furthermore, this circuit does not favor denial of class \ncertification on the basis of speculative conflicts.” (citations \nomitted)); see also Portz v. St. Cloud State Univ., 297 F. Supp. \n3d 929, 947 (D. Minn. 2018) (finding that a speculative \nconflict, unsupported by evidence, did not give rise to \ninadequate representation).  The argument has been found to be \nparticularly unpersuasive when the named plaintiffs affirm their \ncommitment to representing the whole class.  See Foltz v. \nDelaware State Univ., 269 F.R.D. 419, 424-25 (D. Del. 2010) \n(disregarding speculative conflict, especially in light of the \ntestimony of several named plaintiffs “that they are motivated \nto obtain equal opportunities for all female students” at the \ninstitution). \n    The OIA’s argument here is that of a similarly \nspeculative, potential conflict.  Therefore, it does not give \nrise to a finding of inadequate representation.  See Swanson v. \nUniv. of Haw. Prof’l Assembly, 212 F.R.D. 574, 577 (D. Hawai`i \n2003) (ruling that a hypothetical conflict was not relevant in \ndeciding adequacy of representation).  A finding of adequate \n25 \n \n\nrepresentation is additionally supported by the declarations of \nseveral named Plaintiffs that they are motivated to obtain equal \nopportunities for female students at Campbell.  See, e.g., \nMotion, decl. of A.B. at ¶ 5 (“I wanted to do something to stand \nup not only for my teammates, but also for all girls at Campbell \nwho have been mistreated for so long.”); decl. of T.T. at ¶ 44 \n(“I am part of this lawsuit because I want things to change for \ngirls.”).  No challenges to the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ counsel \nhave been raised.  Therefore, the adequacy requirement of Rule \n23(a) is satisfied. \n  D.  Summary \n    The proposed class cannot be certified because it \nfails to meet the numerosity requirement and, as to Count III, \nthe commonality and typicality requirements.  Because the \nproposed class does not meet the Rule 23(a) requirements, it is \nnot necessary to address the Rule 23(b) requirements. \n \nCONCLUSION \n    On the basis of the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ Motion to \nCertify Class, filed May 3, 2019, is HEREBY DENIED. \n    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n\t  \n26 \n \n\n    DATED AT HONOLULU, HAWAI`I, December 31, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA.B., ET AL.

(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), by and through \ntheir attorneys, for this complaint, allege and aver as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1. This case is about ensuring that female athletes in Hawaii’s public\nschools are on a level playing field with their male athlete counterparts. Plaintiffs \nare female athletes at James Campbell High School (“Campbell”), which is run by \nthe Hawaii State Department of Education (“DOE”). They are passionate and \ndedicated athletes. Yet simply because of their gender, Plaintiffs experience \ngrossly unequal treatment, benefits, and opportunities in relation to male athletes. \n2. As just one example of this disparity, for decades, male athletes at\nCampbell have had exclusive access to a stand-alone athletic locker room facility \nin which they can store gear, change, shower, use the bathrooms, hold team \nmeetings, and build team spirit. Female athletes have nothing comparable. As a \nresult, female athletes must lug their athletic gear around all day. Female athletes \nmust resort to changing in teachers’ closets, in the bathroom of the nearest Burger \nKing, and even on the practice field, risking potential exposure to bystanders. To \ngo to the bathroom, female athletes must run back to the campus gym (which is \nlocated roughly two football fields in length away), use decrepit porta-potties \n(which are sometimes locked), or face having to crouch down in the bushes. \n1 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 4 of 67     PageID.4\nPerhaps most important, female athletes must carry the burden of knowing their \neducational institution does not value them as much—that they are, in essence, \nsecond-class—just because they are female. \n3.  The DOE has perpetuated these inequities for decades across its \nschools. Since at least as early as 1978, the DOE was on notice that it had various \nunmet deficiencies relating to its Title IX compliance. The DOE said it was \nworking to close those gaps. But what followed was four decades of delay in \nproviding female athletes with treatment, benefits, and opportunities equal to those \nreceived by male athletes as required by Title IX. \n4.  Sadly, the DOE continues to illegally discriminate against female \nathletes today. When making athletics decisions, boys’ sports come first, and girls’ \nsports second. As just one example of this skewed “boys first” mindset, the DOE’s \n2016 “Master Plan for Athletic Facilities” recommended that one of its high \nschools, Kailua High School, proceed with “upgrad[ing] the baseball field to a \nplayoff condition field” before building a “girls athletic locker room”—a facility \nthat was, and to this day remains, on the DOE’s official “Wish List” of items to \naccomplish.2 As set forth below, the DOE’s decision-making at Campbell \ncontinuously discriminates against girls. \n                                              \n2 Sato & Associates, Inc., Statewide Athletic Plan, Master Planning and \nSchool Assessment, Job No. Q61002-12, Master Plan for Athletic Facilities, DEP’T \nOF EDUC., STATE OF HAWAII (Feb. 2016) at PDF 4-5, available at \n  2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 5 of 67     PageID.5\n5.  The Oahu Interscholastic Association (“OIA”)—which administers \npolicies and regulations governing interscholastic athletics for all Oahu-based DOE \nhigh schools, and which acts under the control of and in close coordination with \nthe DOE—also discriminates against girls in its decisions concerning \ninterscholastic athletics, including in scheduling of games, seasons, and \ntournaments, as well as in publicity and promotion, at Campbell and other Oahu-\nbased DOE high schools. \n6.  Plaintiffs seek to change this unjust and unlawful state of affairs. On \nbehalf of the present and future female student athletes at Campbell, Plaintiffs \nbring this class action against the DOE and the OIA (collectively, “Defendants”), \nwhich have unlawfully discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of Plaintiffs’ \nrights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Plaintiffs also seek \nredress against the DOE for unlawfully retaliating against Plaintiffs when they \nhave brought such discrimination to the DOE’s attention. \n7.  On behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs \nseek declaratory relief and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from \ncontinuing to engage in unlawful sex-based discrimination. Defendants’ \nlongstanding practice of putting female athletes of Hawaii second must end. \n \n                                                                                                                                                  \nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4367267-HIDOE-Athletics-Master-\nPlan-and-Assessment.html.  \n  3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 6 of 67     PageID.6\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because \nPlaintiffs bring this action under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. and its implementing regulations. \n9.  This Court may order declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n10.  Venue is properly in the United States District Court for the District of \nHawaii pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Defendants are located in this \ndistrict, and the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n11.  Plaintiff A.B., age 17, is a twelfth-grade student at Campbell who \ncompetes on the girls’ varsity water polo and the girls’ varsity swimming teams. \nDefendants have discriminated against A.B. on the basis of her sex by denying her \nequal athletic opportunities, treatment, and benefits.  Because A.B. is a minor, she \nbrings this action by her next friends, her parents C.B. and D.B. A.B., C.B., and \nD.B. are residents of Hawaii. \n12.  Plaintiff T.T., age 17, is a twelfth-grade student at Campbell who \ncompetes on the girls’ varsity water polo and the girls’ varsity swimming teams. \nDefendants have discriminated against T.T. on the basis of her sex by denying her \n  4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 7 of 67     PageID.7\nequal athletic opportunities, treatment, and benefits. Because T.T. is a minor, she \nbrings this action by her next friends, her parents K.T. and S.T. T.T., K.T., and \nS.T. are residents of Hawaii. \nDefendants \n13.  Defendant DOE is the state administrative agency that manages the \nstatewide system of public schools consisting of 15 complex areas and 292 \nschools. Among the schools that the DOE manages is Campbell, which is a four-\nyear public high school located in Ewa Beach, Oahu. Campbell, which is part of \nthe DOE’s Leeward Oahu District, is the largest public high school in Hawaii in \nterms of number of students. The DOE receives federal financial assistance and is \nsubject to the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX. \n14.  Defendant OIA is an unincorporated athletic association composed of \nall of the DOE’s secondary schools on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The OIA is an \ninstrumentality of, and is controlled by, the DOE. \n15.  The DOE is pervasively entwined in the management and control of \nthe OIA. The OIA’s Executive Director is a DOE employee, and all five regular \nmembers of the OIA’s Executive Council are principals of DOE high schools and \ntherefore also DOE employees. \n16.  The OIA also has controlling authority over many aspects of the \nDOE’s interscholastic athletic programs, including competitive facilities; \n  5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 8 of 67     PageID.8\nscheduling of seasons, games, and tournaments; travel; publicity and promotion; \nand budget. The OIA indirectly receives federal financial assistance. The OIA is \nsubject to the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  DOE’s Long History of Non-Compliance with Title IX \n17.  Nearly half a century ago, Congress passed Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any \nfederally funded education program or activity. Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, \n373 (June 23, 1972) (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.). The promise behind \nTitle IX was to root out sex discrimination in all aspects of education programs, \nand to protect individuals against such discriminatory practices. \n18.  In 2002, Title IX was renamed the “Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity \nin Education Act” in honor of Hawaii’s own Congresswoman Patsy Mink, the first \nwoman of color elected to Congress, and—notably for the purposes of this \nlawsuit—a co-author and champion of Title IX. \n19.  In many respects, Title IX has been successful in increasing female \nparticipation in athletics. As evidence of this success, in 1971, before Title IX was \nenacted, only about 294,000 of the nation’s high school athletes—or roughly 7.4% \n  6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 9 of 67     PageID.9\nof all high school athletes—were girls. Today, that number has risen over ten times \nto over 3.4 million, meaning that about 42.8% of all high school athletes are girls.3 \n20.  But at least within the State of Hawaii, Title IX’s promise remains \nunfulfilled. Nearly half a century after Title IX took effect, the DOE today fails to \nprovide Campbell female student athletes (and female students at other Hawaii \npublic schools) with athletic opportunities, treatment, and benefits equal to those \nprovided to its male student athletes. And as the history of the DOE’s actions—and \nparticularly its inaction—shows, the DOE’s present failures are in fact the \ncontinuation of four decades of noncompliance with Title IX. \nA. Initial Failures to Comply with Title IX: 1978 to 2000 \n21.  Since as early as 1978—which is the year by which secondary schools \nneeded to be in compliance with Title IX—the DOE has been discriminating \nagainst female athletes in violation of Title IX. \n22.  That year, a compliance officer from the federal Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) visited Hawaii to investigate the DOE’s \ncompliance with Title IX and other federal civil rights laws. The EEOC found \nwidespread Title IX problems. Among other things, the DOE had not: trained its \ncivil rights coordinators in monitoring educational programs for compliance with \n                                              \n3 National Federation of State High School Associations, 2017-18 High \nSchool Athletics Participation Survey, at 54, available at \nhttp://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/PDF/2017-\n18%20High%20School%20Athletics%20Participation%20Survey.pdf. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 10 of 67     PageID.10\nfederal sex discrimination laws; promulgated and implemented student and \nemployee Title IX grievance procedures; disseminated information regarding Title \nIX to DOE students and staff; or monitored school athletic expenditures by sport \nand sex. Many of these deficiencies remain to this day.  \n23.  At the time, the DOE represented that it would remedy these Title IX \nissues. But subsequent events demonstrate that the DOE never did so. \n24.  Indeed, over fifteen years later, in 1994, State Representative Jackie \nYoung sent a letter to the DOE expressing dismay about the many gender \ninequities evident throughout DOE schools and specifically across its facilities for \npractices and games, equipment and uniforms, travel opportunities, scheduling, \ncompetitive opportunities, and budgeting. \n25.  After another five years of girls continuing to be denied access to \nequality in sports, and fed up with the lack of progress, both the Hawaii state \nlegislature and the Governor acted to address the DOE’s failures in monitoring and \nenforcing gender equality in athletics. \n26.  The Hawaii state legislature was first to act, passing a bill in 1999 that \nwould have “[p]rohibit[ed] discrimination in athletics on the basis of sex in any \npublic school” and “require[d] the [DOE] superintendent . . . to develop a strategic \n  8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 11 of 67     PageID.11\nplan to ensure equity in sports participation.”4 This legislative action was stopped \nby the Governor, who vetoed the bill because the DOE had expressly assured the \nGovernor that the agency was “in total compliance” with Title IX. \n27.  The DOE’s representations were false. In fact, in school year 1999-\n2000, there were still vast Title IX non-compliance issues. For example, thirty-nine \nschools had boys’ athletic locker rooms while only twenty-three had girls’ athletic \nlocker rooms—that is, at least sixteen DOE schools provided locker room facilities \nin an inequitable manner, and in violation of Title IX. \n28.  Upon discovering that the DOE was not in compliance with Title IX, \nthen-governor Cayetano responded with executive action. He demanded that the \nDOE commit to a timeline for coming into compliance, articulate precisely what its \nshort- and long-term compliance plans were, and start mandatory compliance \nreviews at every public high school coupled with quarterly and annual reporting. \n29.  Shortly thereafter, in 2000, the legislature affirmed that a state law \nwas necessary to ensure that girls realize their right to equal athletic treatment and \nopportunities in Hawaii’s public high schools and passed a law requiring gender \nequity in athletics (the “Gender Equity in Athletics Law”).5 \n                                              \n4 Gender Equity in Sports, House Bill 532 (1999), \nhttps://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session1999/status/HB532_his_.htm. \n5 Gender Equity in Sports, Senate Bill 2475 (2000), \nhttps://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2000/acts/Act229_SB2475_CD1_.htm \n(codified at Haw. Rev. Stat. § 302A-461). \n  9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 12 of 67     PageID.12\nB. Continued Failure to Comply After Hawaii’s Executive and Legislative \nBranches Mandated Gender Equity in Athletics: 2000 to 2003 \n \n30.  The Gender Equity in Athletics Law’s mandate was clear: “No \nperson, on the basis of sex, shall be excluded from participating in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in athletics offered by a public high \nschool, pursuant to Public Law 92-318, Title IX of the federal Education \nAmendments of 1972.” \n31.  The Gender Equity in Athletics Law also created an advisory \ncommission on gender equity in sports (“Advisory Commission”) to support the \nDOE in complying with Title IX’s requirements. The Advisory Commission’s \nresponsibilities included determining whether the DOE’s schools were coming into \ncompliance with Title IX, and making recommendations to the DOE and the state \nlegislature. \n32.  For three years, from 2000 to 2003, the Advisory Commission played \na key role in exposing routine delays in the DOE’s completion of baseline \ncompliance assessments and its piecemeal or misguided approaches to resolving \ngender equity issues. \n33.  During this period, evaluations focused on athletic facilities, \nscheduling, and coaching at five DOE high schools.6 The evaluations constituted \nhundreds of pages, and produced damning results. Among the many findings of \n                                              \n6 Hilo, Kahuku, Kaiser, King Kekaulike, and Roosevelt. \n  10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 13 of 67     PageID.13\nnoncompliance: (1) four of the five schools provided better locker rooms for boys \nthan for girls; (2) the highest quality athletic facilities were typically assigned to \nboys’ teams and not girls’ teams; (3) at one school, boys’ teams had three different \ndressing rooms available to them, whereas girls’ teams had access to a single \ndressing room; and (4) across the board, boys’ teams had far more opportunities to \nengage in pre-season competition than girls’ teams. \n34.  In 2003, the Advisory Commission issued its final report.  The report \nnoted that minimal progress had been made regarding gender equity in DOE \nschools, and highlighted several stark disparities that remained, including the need \nto build and upgrade girls’ athletic locker rooms at many high schools statewide. \n35.  The Advisory Commission’s report also found that the DOE was not \nin compliance with the U.S. Department of Education’s athletic participation \nopportunities test. Specifically, the athletic participation rate of girls in DOE \nschools was substantially disproportionate relative to student enrollment. While \ngirls constituted nearly 48% of students enrolled in DOE schools, they only made \nup 40% of athletic participants—representing a nearly 8% participation gap. This \nmeant that hundreds or thousands of girls were not getting the chance to play \ncompared to their male counterparts. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 14 of 67     PageID.14\nC. Progress on Gender Equity Reverses Course: 2004 to Present \n36.  After the Advisory Commission’s work concluded, progress regarding \ngender equity in athletics has halted and, in several respects, even regressed. \n37.  For example, according to DOE self-assessments conducted in or \naround 2005, at least twelve high schools—including Campbell—identified \nthemselves as needing plans to reassign locker rooms from male athletes to female \nathletes because of ongoing inequalities in the allocation of athletic locker room \nfacilities.7 \n38.  Yet, according to the DOE’s 2016 “Master Plan for Athletic \nFacilities,” of the twelve high schools identified as having inequitable locker room \nfacilities, at least four (Baldwin, Campbell, Kahuku, and Waialua) still failed to \nprovide stand-alone athletic locker rooms to girls in 2016.8 That is, one third of the \nschools that the DOE had conclusively identified as needing remediation in 2005 \nstill had not yet reassigned locker rooms from boys to girls or had not yet closed \nthe gender disparity in other respects eleven years later. \n39.  According to the same “Master Plan for Athletic Facilities,” as of \n2016, ten additional schools had athletic locker rooms for boys but not for girls. \n                                              \n7 The following high schools were identified as having an inequitable \ndistribution of athletic locker room facilities: Aeia, Baldwin, Campbell, Farrington, \nHilo, Kahuku, Kaimuki, Kau, Keeau, Leilehua, McKinley, Waialua, and Waianae. \n8 Upon information and belief, the same inequities persist at Baldwin, \nCampbell, Kahuku, and Waialua high schools as of this filing. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 15 of 67     PageID.15\n40.  Thus, thirteen years after the Advisory Commission’s final report—\nand nearly fifty years after Title IX was passed—the disparity in athletic locker \nrooms between female athletes and male athletes remains essentially unchanged; at \nleast fourteen high schools provide athletic locker rooms for their male athletes, \nbut not for their female athletes. \n41.  In addition to inequitable facilities, Title IX compliance monitoring \nand enforcement by the DOE has effectively halted. For the past few years, there is \nno public record that DOE schools have conducted compliance reviews or \nsubmitted reports about Title IX compliance. This is so in spite of the fact that the \nDOE has expressed a commitment to conduct these reviews and submit these \nreports, and otherwise comply with Title IX. \n42.  The DOE’s regression with respect to Title IX compliance is troubling \nin light of history: Title IX non-compliance in DOE schools has been the focus of \nprior litigation before this Court. In 2010, the ACLU of Hawaii filed a lawsuit in \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii on behalf of three female athletes \nat the DOE’s Baldwin High School in Wailuku, Maui, to rectify the DOE’s \ndiscriminatory treatment of the Baldwin High School girls’ softball team.9 \n43.  In granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, Judge \nDavid Alan Ezra concluded that “the evidence is very clear that the girls’ facilities \n                                              \n9 Nobriga v. Dep’t of Educ., State of Hawaii, 1:10-cv-159-DAE-LK, Doc. 1 \n(D. Haw. Mar. 18, 2010). \n  13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 16 of 67     PageID.16\nare decidedly inferior to those of the boys’, and they have been for years.”10 Judge \nEzra emphasized that he believed “without reservation that the Department of \nEducation and the people who acted in concert . . . have not met Title IX or \nconstitutional standards, period. This isn’t even a close question.”11 Given the \nextreme disparities he had observed, Judge Ezra expressed surprise at the DOE’s \nnon-compliance: “Why somebody didn’t file a Title IX suit on this years ago is \nbeyond me . . . .”12 \n44.  Shortly after Judge Ezra’s ruling, the DOE entered into a settlement \nagreement with the plaintiffs that required the DOE to, among other things, \nimprove and expand existing girls’ softball facilities, and build a new girls’ softball \npractice field on par with the field already existing for boys.13 \n45.  Despite the 2010 Baldwin High School lawsuit, the DOE has not \nensured gender equity in athletics statewide. Across the board, the DOE’s gender \nequity policies and practices remain deficient. In failing to address the vast \ndisparities that remain, the DOE has shown that it acts only when individuals \nthreaten—or, in this case, file—legal action. \n                                              \n10 Nobriga, 1:10-cv-159-DAE-LK, Doc. 37, at 37 (D.

Female athletes at Campbell and across Hawaii have been waiting for \nnearly fifty years to receive the same treatment, benefits, and opportunities as male \nathletes as mandated by law. Instead of moving forward to close the gender gap, \nthe DOE appears to be going backwards. \n47.  It is precisely because of the DOE’s longstanding failure to comply \nwith Title IX that Plaintiffs file the present lawsuit.14 \nII. The Unequal Female Athletic Experience at Campbell High School \n \n48.  Campbell is a four-year public high school located in Ewa Beach, \nOahu, and run by the DOE. \n49.  Of the DOE’s approximately 55 high schools statewide, Campbell \nserves the most students, matriculating 3,123 students in the 2017-2018 school \nyear. Of those students, 1,506 were female and 1,617 were male. \n                                              \n14 The DOE’s indifference to complying with Title IX is not limited to \nathletics. On December 20, 2017, the DOE and the United States Department of \nEducation entered into a resolution agreement to address deficiencies in the DOE’s \npolicies, procedures, and processes used for responding to complaints of \nharassment of students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or disability. \nSee Resolution Agreement, OCR Docket No. 10-11-5003 (Dec. 20, 2017), \navailable at \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10115003-\nb.pdf. The United States Department of Education did not investigate—and \nconsequently the resolution agreement did not address—the DOE’s failure to \nprovide equal treatment, benefits, and opportunities in athletics under Title IX. See \nLetter from Linda Mangel, Regional Director, U.S. Department of Education, \nOffice for Civil Rights, to Dr. Christina Kishimoto, Superintendent, DOE (Jan. 19, \n2018), available at \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10115003-\na.pdf. \n  15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 18 of 67     PageID.18\n50.  The female athletic experience at Campbell today is a byproduct of \nthe DOE’s historically inequitable treatment of female athletes in Hawaii’s public \nschools: female athletes receive worse treatment, fewer benefits, and fewer \nopportunities than male athletes. \n51.  Many aspects of the female athletic experience at Campbell are \ncontrolled or greatly influenced by the OIA, which through its policies and \npractices also treats female athletes inequitably by providing them worse treatment, \nfewer benefits, and fewer opportunities than male athletes. \n52.  Upon information and belief, the female athletic experience at other \nDOE high schools is substantially similar to that at Campbell. \nA. The DOE and the OIA’s Sex-Based Discrimination in Athletic \nTreatment and Benefits \n \n53.  The DOE has failed to provide an effective system for Title IX \nimplementation, monitoring, and compliance across its schools statewide. \n54.  Partly due to this lack of oversight, the DOE fails to provide equitable \nathletic treatment and benefits to Campbell female students in comparison to male \nstudents. \n55.  As described below, the DOE’s sex-based discrimination is evident in \nits: (i) athletic locker rooms, practice facilities, and competitive facilities; (ii) \nequipment and supplies; (iii) scheduling of games and practice times; (iv) \n  16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 19 of 67     PageID.19\navailability and quality of coaching; (v) travel opportunities; (vi) medical and \ntraining services and facilities; and (vii) publicity and promotion.15 \n56.  As described below, the OIA’s sex-based discrimination is evident in \nits: (i) competitive facilities; (ii) scheduling of games; (iv) travel opportunities; and \n(iv) publicity and promotion. \ni.  Locker rooms, practice facilities, and competitive facilities \n \n1.  Absence of athletic locker room for female athletes \n \n57.  Campbell is one of the many DOE high schools that fails to provide \nathletic locker room facilities to female athletes while simultaneously providing \nsuch facilities to male athletes.16 \n                                              \n15 These are some of the factors that the U.S. Department of Education \nconsiders in determining whether a school provides equal athletics benefits and \nopportunities in compliance with Title IX. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c). \n16 DOE high schools usually have three types of locker rooms: P.E. locker \nrooms, gym locker rooms, and athletic locker rooms. P.E. locker rooms are used \nexclusively for physical education students during the school day. They are \ngenerally closed to student-athletes after school hours. Gym locker rooms are \nattached to the gym and primarily serve student-athletes participating in indoor \nsports (e.g., volleyball, basketball). Athletic locker rooms are typically stand-alone \nfacilities (often near the school’s athletic fields) that primarily serve student-\nathletes participating in outdoor sports (e.g., track and field, cross country, softball, \nbaseball, football, soccer). Such athletic locker rooms typically are substantially \nlarger and of higher quality than P.E. and gym locker rooms, and also contain more \namenities such as toilet stalls, larger and more numerous lockers, showers, and \noffices. Some DOE high schools have athletic locker rooms attached as annexes to \ngym locker rooms, rather than as stand-alone facilities. For the purpose of this \ncomplaint, “athletic locker room” refers to a school’s stand-alone athletic locker \nroom facility and/or any such annex to the gym locker room. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 20 of 67     PageID.20\n58.  Specifically, male athletes at Campbell have exclusive access to a \nstand-alone athletic locker room facility that is located near the athletic fields. This \nstandalone athletic locker room is a very large facility that is at least two times the \nsize of the gym-based locker room. The stand-alone athletic locker room has about \n120 full-size lockers, showers, and at least four bathroom stalls. The stand-alone \nathletic locker room also has air conditioning and an office. \n59.  By contrast, female athletes at Campbell have no standalone athletic \nlocker room facility, whether located near the athletic fields or elsewhere on \ncampus. That is, female athletes have no full-size lockers, no showers, no \nbathrooms, no air conditioning, and no office near the athletic fields.  \n60.  Instead, female athletes, including Plaintiffs, must carry their athletic \ngear around with them all day and have resorted to changing in teachers’ closets, in \nthe bathroom of the nearest Burger King, and even on the practice field, potentially \nin full view of bystanders. To use the bathroom, female athletes must run back to \nthe main campus, use decrepit porta-potties (which are sometimes locked), or face \ncrouching down in the bushes. Plaintiffs, who are part of the girls’ water polo \nprogram, sometimes have no practical choice but to change on the bus. \n61.  The absence of an athletic locker room facility has many negative \neffects on female athletes at Campbell. \n  18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 21 of 67     PageID.21\n62.  Female athletes at Campbell, including Plaintiffs, experience constant \nstress and inconvenience from the lack of athletic locker room facilities. For \nexample, female athletes experience stress and inconvenience when they are forced \nto lug their equipment and gear throughout the school day. This interferes with \ntheir ability to concentrate on schoolwork during the academic day. \n63.  Female athletes at Campbell also experience stress and inconvenience \nwhen they struggle—after school ends and before sports practice begins—to find a \nplace in which to change into athletic attire. \n64.  Additionally, because they do not have access to athletic locker room \nfacilities, unlike their male counterparts, some female athletes at Campbell \nhurriedly shuttle home after school to gather equipment and change into practice \nattire. \n65.  Some female athletes at Campbell are penalized by their coaches \nwhen they show up late to practice because they cannot find places in which to \nchange, or because the places that they do find are overcrowded, costing them \nmore time to make the transition after school ends. \n66.  Campbell female athletes’ privacy is routinely compromised as a \nresult of the lack of access to locker room facilities. About half of the girls’ softball \nprogram and about half of the girls’ cross country program change in the bleachers \nby the field, with students holding up jackets to cover one another in an attempt to \n  19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 22 of 67     PageID.22\npreserve their teammates’ privacy. Female athletes in the wrestling program also \nchange and conduct weigh-ins in the Campbell hallways. Female athletes in the \njudo program change and conduct weigh-ins in the corner of the gym or in the \nhallway, and male athletes sometimes walk in on the female athletes, including as \nrecently as two weeks ago. \n2.  Absence of practice facilities for female athletes \n67.  Campbell is one of the many DOE high schools at which girls’ sports \nprograms do not have adequate access to practice facilities. \n68.  The Campbell girls’ water polo program has been consistently treated \nunequally when it comes to securing practice facilities. For example, during the \n2017-18 school year, the DOE failed to secure a pool for the girls’ water polo \nprogram until after the season had already started. \n69.  As a result of the DOE’s inattention to girls’ sports, the Campbell \ngirls’ water polo program was left with no choice but to hold dry-land training \nsessions and open-ocean swim practices at Puuloa Beach Park. \n70.  Also, as a result of the DOE’s inattention to girls’ sports, the \nCampbell girls’ water polo program played at least two regular season games \nwithout having had a single minute of practice time in a pool. \n71.  In fact, the DOE’s failures with respect to the Campbell girls’ water \npolo program are memorialized in the 2018 Campbell yearbook: \n  20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 23 of 67     PageID.23\n \n72.  This failure occurred even though the students, coaches, and parents \nassociated with the girls’ water polo program made various efforts in an attempt to \nget the DOE and the Campbell administration to secure a pool. \n73.  Worse, when members of the Campbell girls’ water polo program \ncontinued to raise their concerns with the Campbell Principal Jon Henry Lee and \n  21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 24 of 67     PageID.24\nAthletic Director Samuel Delos Reyes, the Campbell administrators retaliated on at \nleast three separate occasions by threatening to “cancel” the water polo team, the \nwater polo season, or both. \n74.  By contrast, at the same time that the girls’ water polo program was \nlobbying the DOE and the Campbell administration to secure a practice facility, the \nAthletic Director was attempting to secure off-season athletic opportunities for the \nboys’ baseball and boys’ football programs. \n75.  The girls’ water polo program was approximately two weeks into the \ncompetitive season when the DOE finally secured a pool in which the girls’ water \npolo program could practice. \n76.  Additionally, although the DOE legally secured the pool by signing \nthe necessary paperwork, the Campbell girls’ water polo coach still had to use his \nown personal funds to pay to use a regulation-sized pool. The girls’ water polo \ncoach spent approximately $60 per day, two days a week, because the DOE would \nnot provide funding. \n77.  The Campbell girls’ water polo program’s experience during the \n2017-18 school year is not unique. For at least the five prior years, the girls’ water \npolo program had encountered similar problems gaining timely access to a pool in \nwhich to practice. For example, the girls’ water polo program has recently had to \n  22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 25 of 67     PageID.25\npractice in a non-regulation pool divided and shared with neighboring rival, \nKapolei High School. \n78.  The Campbell cheerleading program17—which is all-female—also has \nbeen consistently treated unequally when it comes to securing practice facilities. \nThe Campbell cheerleading program has no dedicated practice facility and \nregularly has trouble finding places in which to practice. \n79.  Even when it finds a temporary space in which to practice, the \nCampbell cheerleading program is frequently displaced by other athletic programs. \nBecause of this displacement, the Campbell cheerleading program sometimes has \nto practice in the Campbell cafeteria, where students resort to changing behind \ntables. During at least some portion of the 2017-18 school year, the cheerleading \nprogram had nowhere to store its mats. \n3.  Unequal facilities \n80.  In addition to the complete absence of facilities for certain girls’ \nsports programs, the DOE provides unequal facilities to girls’ sports programs in \nrelation to boys’ sports programs. \n                                              \n17 Plaintiffs do not have sufficient information to take a legal position on \nwhether cheerleading at Campbell counts as an interscholastic athletic activity for \nthe purpose of determining Title IX compliance. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ. Office for \nCivil Rights, Dear Colleague Letter: Athletic Activities Counted for Title IX \nCompliance (Sept. 17, 2008), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-20080917.html. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 26 of 67     PageID.26\n81.  For example, Campbell is one of the many DOE high schools at \nwhich the girls’ softball program’s facilities are unequal in relation to the boys’ \nbaseball program’s facilities.18 \n82.  The DOE provides the Campbell boys’ baseball program more \nfacilities and facilities of a higher quality than those provided to the girls’ softball \nprogram. The boys’ baseball program has a dedicated “baseball house,” with a \ncouch and mini-fridge, that is used to store equipment, hold meetings, and gather \nbefore practice. Additionally, the boys’ baseball program has a large storage \ncontainer in which to store gear and equipment. The boys’ baseball program has a \nbatting cage that is for its exclusive use. The boys’ baseball program has access to \nbathrooms in the stand-alone athletic locker room facility, or unisex porta-potties \nthat are conveniently located next to the baseball field. \n83.  By contrast, the DOE provides the girls’ softball program —which \nhas been Softball Division I state champions four times during the last eight \nyears19—few facilities and facilities of lower quality in comparison to their male \ncounterparts. The girls’ softball program has no dedicated “softball house”—or any \n                                              \n18 According to the DOE, a renovation of the softball field is “currently in \nprogress,” but it is unclear when such renovation will be completed. In fact, as of \nApril 2018, the DOE reported that, rather than being in progress, the “[s]oftball \nfield renovations are in the planning stage.” Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board No. \n23 Meeting Minutes (Apr. 12, 2018), available at http://www.honolulu.gov/cms-\nnco-menu/site-nco-sitearticles/31332-ewa-nb-april-minutes.html. \n19 The boys’ baseball program has been champions once during that period.  \n  24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 27 of 67     PageID.27\nfacility even remotely equivalent. The girls’ softball program has a storage \ncontainer, but it is half the size of the boys’ container and has so many cracks in \nthe roof that everything is ruined if softball players leave equipment in the \ncontainer when it rains. The girls’ softball program has no batting cage. The girls’ \nsoftball program has no access to bathroom facilities near the softball field, so they \nmust instead resort to using the porta-potties (which are located next to the \nbaseball field and are sometimes locked), running to the gym (which is located \nroughly two football fields in length away), or crouching down behind the storage \ncontainer. \n84.  The boys’ baseball field is also located closer to the school and on the \nbetter section of the shared athletic field area. Specifically, the baseball field is at a \nhigher elevation than the softball field. \n85.  The girls’ softball field, on the other hand, is located further away \nfrom the school and on the worst section of the shared athletic field area. Because \nthe softball field is at a lower elevation than the baseball field, when it rains, the \nsoftball field frequently floods and requires the use of sponges and other drainage \nmethods to make the field usable by the softball program. \n  25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 28 of 67     PageID.28\n4.  Unequal facility maintenance \n86.  In addition to the stark disparities that exist between the athletic \nfacilities provided to boys relative to girls, the Campbell administration provides \nbetter maintenance regarding boys’ facilities as compared to girls’ facilities. \n87.  For example, the boys’ football program had its broken lights on the \nfootball field fixed immediately, whereas the girls’ soccer program could not even \nconvince the Campbell administration to install lights for after-dark practice and \ncompetition. \n88.  The soccer field is frequently irrigated during scheduled girls’ soccer \npractices, forcing the girls’ soccer program to practice inside the gym, which is \ndangerous because of the increased risk of slippage and knee injuries from the \nsmooth hard surface. \n89.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to athletic locker rooms, practice facilities, and competitive \nfacilities. Upon information and belief, this unequal provision of benefits has been \nlongstanding and has led to—and will continue to lead to—unequal practice and \ncompetitive facilities over time. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 29 of 67     PageID.29\n90.  Thus, the DOE and the Campbell administration have a systematic \npolicy and practice of using limited resources and capacity to provide better \nathletic facilities and benefits to male athletes as compared to female athletes. \n5.  Unequal allocation of competitive facilities \n91.  The DOE and the OIA (which acts under the control of, and in close \ncoordination with, the DOE) determine which competitive facilities are used by \nathletic programs in DOE interscholastic athletic competition. \n92.  The DOE and the OIA unlawfully discriminate against female athletes \nby consistently allocating the prime competitive facilities to boys’ sports programs. \n93.  For example, upon information and belief, the DOE and the OIA grant \nthe boys’ football programs exclusive use of Aloha Stadium, which, as the largest \nstadium in Hawaii, is the premier competitive facility in the state. The Campbell \nboys’ football program used Aloha Stadium as recently as November 2, 2018, \nwhen it competed in an OIA championship playoff game against Farrington High \nSchool. The Campbell boys’ football program also competed there in an OIA \nplayoff game in October 2017. By contrast, upon information and belief, no girls’ \nsports program has ever had the opportunity to use Aloha Stadium for athletic \ncompetition. \n  27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 30 of 67     PageID.30\nii.  Equipment and supplies \n \n94.  The provision of equipment and supplies is inequitable between \nfemale and male athletes at Campbell. \n95.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to equipment and supplies. Upon information and belief, this \nunequal provision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will \ncontinue to lead to—unequal equipment and supplies over time. \n96.  The DOE consistently does not provide proper equipment and gear to \nthe Campbell girls’ water polo program. For the most part, the girls’ water polo \nprogram relies on parents to use personal funds to purchase equipment. For \nexample, a couple years ago, parents bought replacement swimsuits for the water \npolo athletes because the DOE failed to provide them. The girls’ water polo \nprogram also used to have old swim caps that did not meet game regulations. \nThese old swim caps further posed a serious safety and choking hazard because \nthey were loose, stretched out, and often fell behind the athletes’ heads while \nhanging around their necks, which created more drag underwater and allowed \nopponents to pull the athletes underwater. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 31 of 67     PageID.31\n97.  The girls’ soccer program experiences similar problems obtaining \nproper equipment and gear. For example, during the 2016-17 school year, a parent \nof a girls’ soccer team player used personal funds to purchase new uniforms \nbecause the DOE failed to provide them.  \n98.  Meanwhile, the football program has no trouble obtaining proper \nequipment and gear, which are refreshed on a regular basis. Upon information and \nbelief, the DOE provides the Campbell boys’ football program proper equipment, \ngear, and supplies. \niii.  Scheduling of games and practice time \n \n99.  The DOE and the OIA control and operate the scheduling of seasons, \ngames, and tournaments relating to interscholastic athletics in DOE schools. \n100.  The scheduling of games and practice times is inequitable between \nfemale and male athletes at Campbell. \n101.  Friday nights are considered prime time for athletic competition at \nCampbell because they draw the largest crowds and student and community \nsupport. However, based upon the publicly available schedules of Campbell sports \nprograms’ games in the 2018-19 school year, three quarters of the Friday night \nslots are designated for boys’ sports programs. By contrast, girls’ sports programs \nrarely play on Friday nights. \n  29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 32 of 67     PageID.32\n102.  In fact, girls’ sports programs tend to play on less ideal days. For \nexample, during the 2017-18 school year, the girls’ softball program played many \nof its regular season games on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which are less ideal days \nthan Fridays or weekend days, because games in the middle of the week do not \ndraw large crowds and student and community support, and also interfere with \nstudent-athletes’ ability to attend school, complete homework, and study for tests. \n103.  By contrast, during the 2017-18 school year, the boys’ baseball \nprogram typically played regular season games on Fridays or weekend days. \n104.  This inequitable scheme is substantially the same regarding practice \ntime. The DOE illegally discriminates against practice times for girls’ sports in \nfavor of those for boys’ sports. \n105.  For example, the boys’ basketball program is allowed to hold double \npractices at the expense of the girls’ volleyball program. Specifically, the boys’ \nbasketball program displaces the girls’ volleyball program whenever the boys’ \nbasketball program decides it wants to have additional practice. \n106.  As another example, during the spring, even though the boys’ football \nprogram is in its off-season, it regularly displaces the track and field program. \n107.  The girls’ programs also practice during less preferable times in \nrelation to when the boys’ programs practice. \n  30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 33 of 67     PageID.33\n108.  For example, even though the track and field program is co-\neducational, the girls’ track and field athletes almost always start their practice \nfirst, at around 3 p.m., when the heat and humidity is most oppressive. Meanwhile, \nthe boys’ track and field athletes start their practice later, at around 4:30 p.m., \nwhen the weather is cooler and the sun is less intense. \n109.  The girls’ soccer program practices on the field after the football \nprogram.  The field is often full of divots created by football practice, making it \ndangerous for the girls’ soccer program to practice and leading to increased \ninjuries. \niv.  Availability and quality of coaching \n \n110.  The DOE provides female student athletes at Campbell fewer \nopportunities to receive coaching in comparison to male student athletes. \n111.  Upon information and belief, the DOE does not provide female \nathletes the same or similar number of coaches as it provides male athletes. \nSpecifically, the DOE provides more coaches on a per-athlete basis to boys’ sports \nteams than to girls’ sports teams. \n112.  The DOE also discriminates against girls by failing timely to fill gaps \nin coaching positions for girls’ sports as compared to coaching positions for boys’ \nsports. Upon information and belief, Campbell presently has no girls’ varsity \nsoftball coach and no girls’ soccer coach. Upon information and belief, the \n  31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 34 of 67     PageID.34\ncoaching vacancies for boys’ sports are filled more quickly than those for girls’ \nsports. Upon information and belief, the DOE and the Campbell administration \nillegally discriminate by hiring coaches for boys’ sports over girls’ sports. \n113.  Further, upon information and belief, the DOE does not provide \nfemale athletes coaches of the same experience and qualifications as those \nprovided to their male counterparts. Upon information and belief, the DOE hires \ncoaches for girls’ sports programs who are less experienced and qualified than \nthose hired for boys’ sports programs. \n114.  The DOE provides unequal compensation between coaches of girls’ \nsports programs and coaches of boys’ sports programs. \n115.  For example, for two of the past three years, the assistant coaches of \nthe girls’ water polo program did not receive any compensation. \n116.  Upon information and belief, the reason that the coaches for the girls’ \nwater polo program did not receive compensation is that the DOE decided to use \nthe monies allocated for the girls’ water polo program both to provide greater \ncompensation to boys’ football program coaches, and to provide more assistant \ncoaches to the boys’ football program. \n117.  Upon information and belief, every head coach and every assistant \ncoach of a boys’ sports team receives compensation for coaching services provided \nto Campbell’s male athletes. \n  32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 35 of 67     PageID.35\n118.  Upon information and belief, and as a result of the disparities in \ncoaching described above, the tenure of coaches and assistant coaches for girls’ \nsports programs tends to be substantially shorter than the tenure of coaches and \nassistant coaches for boys’ sports programs. For example, the girls’ water polo \nprogram has had three different head coaches in the last four years, which has been \nincredibly disruptive to the water polo athletes. Indeed, both A.B. and T.T. have \nhad a different water polo coach each year they have attended Campbell. \n119.  The disparities in the number of coaches, their qualifications, their \ncompensation, and their tenure significantly reduce female athletes’ opportunities \nto grow as athletes, both individually and as a team. \n120.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to coaching. Upon information and belief, this unequal \nprovision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will continue to \nlead to—unequal coaching over time. \nv.  Travel opportunities \n121.  The DOE and the OIA control and operate the travel opportunities \nrelating to interscholastic athletics in DOE schools. \n  33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 36 of 67     PageID.36\n122.  The DOE and the OIA’s provision of travel opportunities is \ninequitable between female and male athletes at Campbell. \n123.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to travel opportunities. Upon information and belief, this \nunequal provision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will \ncontinue to lead to—unequal travel opportunities over time. \n124.  The boys’ varsity football team frequently travels to neighbor islands \nin the State of Hawaii as well as to locations outside of the state for both in-season \nand off-season playing opportunities. \n125.  During the 2017-18 school year, the boys’ varsity football team \ntraveled to Las Vegas during the winter off-season to participate in a regional \ntournament. \n126.  During the 2018-19 school year, the boys’ varsity football team \ntraveled to the Big Island to play in a non-conference game against a Big Island-\nbased team. \n127.  During the 2018-19 school year, the Campbell Athletic Director \ncontracted for the boys’ varsity football team to travel to Phoenix, Arizona, for a \nweek-long “road trip” that included games against a Phoenix-based football team. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 37 of 67     PageID.37\n128.  As another example, during the 2017-18 school year, the boys’ varsity \nbaseball team flew to the Big Island and Maui for some of its games and \ntournaments. \n129.  Girls’ varsity sports teams do not have—and have not had—similar \nopportunities to travel off the island of Oahu or out of state for practice, \ncompetition, or other forms of athletic enrichment. \nvi.  Medical and training services and facilities \n \n130.  Female student-athletes experience the inequitable provision of \nmedical and training services, and inequitable access to such facilities in \ncomparison to their male counterparts. \n131.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to medical and training services and facilities. Upon \ninformation and belief, this unequal provision of benefits has been longstanding \nand has led to—and will continue to lead to—unequal medical and training \nservices and facilities over time. \n132.  For example, during the 2017-18 school year cross country season, on \nat least one occasion, female cross country athletes were seeking treatment from \nthe trainers in the gym. When members of the boys’ football program entered the \n  35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 38 of 67     PageID.38\ntraining room, the female cross country athletes were asked to move aside so that \nthe boys’ football players could be treated first. \n133.  Trainers are less likely to be present at girls’ games than boys’ games.  \n134.  For example, for several years before the present school year, the \nCampbell trainers did not attend a single girls’ water polo game. \n135.  The 2017-18 school year was the first year in the past four years that \nthe Campbell trainers attended a girls’ water polo game. Nonetheless, Campbell \ntrainers attended only about three of the twelve games that the girls’ water polo \nteam played during the 2017-18 school year. Notably, the Campbell trainers were \nrelied on by the water polo team to address injuries each time they were present at \ngames, showing that they play a necessary and valuable role in athletics. \n136.  Upon information and belief, at least one Campbell trainer attends \nevery boys’ football or boys’ baseball game. \n137.  Because of the DOE’s discrimination, Campbell female athletes have \nbeen put at increased risk of injury. For example, three seasons ago, a water polo \nathlete was experiencing hyperventilation, a panic attack, and muscle cramps. No \nCampbell trainer was present for the game, and the athlete was lucky to be able to \nrely on a non-Campbell trainer to address her medical needs. \n  36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 39 of 67     PageID.39\nvii.  Publicity and promotion \n \n138.  The DOE and the OIA control and operate the publicity and \npromotion relating to interscholastic athletics in DOE schools. \n139.  Upon information and belief, girls’ sports are less often publicized \nand promoted by the DOE and the OIA, and when girls’ sports are publicized and \npromoted, female athletes are often recognized merely as an afterthought. \n140.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to publicity and promotion. Upon information and belief, this \nunequal provision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will \ncontinue to lead to—unequal publicity and promotion over time. \n141.  The DOE and the OIA illegally discriminate by consistently giving \npreferential treatment to the Campbell boys’ football program and the boys’ \nbaseball program with respect to publicity and promotion, including, as previously \nalleged, as a result of the inequitable scheduling of games. Specifically, when \nboys’ athletic programs receive better schedules (such as Friday and weekend \ndays), they are more likely to receive media coverage, and people are more likely \nto be available to watch. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 40 of 67     PageID.40\n142.  The girls’ sports programs do not receive similar publicity and \npromotion, including as a result of the inequitable scheduling of games. \n143.  The “Photo Albums” page of the Campbell website is instructive of \nthis disparity between the promotion of girls’ sports and boys’ sports. The \nCampbell website includes albums on various school events, including \nhomecoming, graduation, contests, and athletics.20 Yet, all of the athletics-related \nphoto albums on the Campbell website are of the boys’ football program. In fact, \nof the approximately 600 total photos on the “Photo Albums” page of the \nCampbell website, over 250 photos—or over 44% of all Campbell photos—depict \nthe boys’ football program. \n144.  By contrast, zero photo albums—and, upon information and belief, \nzero photos—on the “Photo Albums” page of the Campbell website depict a girls’ \nsports program. \n145.  Additionally, the DOE decided to schedule cheer and band only for \nfootball athletic events. Therefore, the Campbell cheerleaders and band do not \nattend any girls’ athletic events or promote any of the girls’ sports programs. \n146.  The DOE and the Campbell administration inequitably publicize and \npromote girls’ sports in other ways. \n                                              \n20 See https://www.campbellhigh.org/apps/album/#!&s=0 \n  38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 41 of 67     PageID.41\n147.  For example, the DOE and the Campbell administration have failed \non several occasions to recognize the girls’ water polo program. During one \nathletic award assembly at which every sports program was to be recognized, the \nCampbell administration completely forgot about the water polo program. Because \nthe Campbell administration forgot about the water polo program, a Campbell staff \nmember scribbled lettering on a poster while the assembly was already occurring \nas a belated attempt to recognize the water polo program. \n148.  During a separate pep rally, the Campbell administration recognized \nthe achievements of various Campbell sports programs, but again failed to \nrecognize those of the girls’ water polo program—even though the team had \nadvanced to the state championship for the first time that season. \n149.  The Campbell Athletic Director has a history of making disparaging \nremarks towards the girls’ water polo program. For example, at one game during \nthe 2014-15 school year, the Athletic Director joked that, if the water polo program \nwas going to lose, Campbell should not even have a water polo program. Despite \nthe Athletic Director’s remark, the Campbell girls’ water polo program won that \ngame. \nB. The DOE’s Failure to Effectively Accommodate Female Students’ \nInterest and Abilities Regarding Participation Opportunities \n \n150.  During the 2017-18 school year, Campbell had 3,123 students \nenrolled: 1,506 students were girls and 1,617 were boys. Thus, girls represent \n  39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 42 of 67     PageID.42\nabout 48.2% of the student body at Campbell, while boys represent about 51.8% of \nthe student body. \n151.  However, based on information and belief and incomplete available \ndata,21 there are approximately 345 female athletes and 484 male athletes at \nCampbell. This means that female athletes account for about 41.6% of the athletic \nopportunities at Campbell, while male athletes account for about 58.4% of the \nathletic opportunities. \n152.  Thus, there exists a 6.6 percentage-point participation gap between \nfemale athletic participation and female student body enrollment.22 \n153.  Based on this participation gap, at least 106 additional opportunities \nfor female athletes must be added to meet part one of the Title IX’s three-part test \n(substantial proportionality). \n                                              \n21 The ACLU of Hawaii sent the DOE a public records request under the \nUniform Information Practices Act (“UIPA”) asking for, among other things, \n“gender participation rates in athletic programs, teams, and opportunities from the \n2009-2010 school year to present.” \n22 The “participation gap” is the difference, expressed in percentage points, \nbetween the percentage of students who are girls and the percentage of athletic \nparticipation opportunities (as measured by the number of roster spots) provided to \ngirls. The participation gap is a key measure used to assess Title IX compliance. \nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights collects athletic \nparticipation data from public schools nationwide as part of the Civil Rights Data \nCollection. See Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Civil Rights \nData Collection, https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html. \n  40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 43 of 67     PageID.43\n154.  Upon information and belief, the DOE does not have a history and \ncontinuing practice of expanding athletic programs for girls at Campbell, and \ntherefore do not satisfy part two of the three-part test. \n155.  The DOE will not establish that they have met Campbell girls’ \ninterests and abilities in playing sports in greater numbers, regarding part three of \nthe three-part test. \nIII.  The DOE’s Responses to Title IX Complaints \nA. Retaliation \n \n156.  Under Title IX, a plaintiff is not obligated to provide notice or to \nexhaust administrative remedies. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs and other Campbell \nfemale athletes, and their parents and coaches, have made numerous written and \noral requests seeking equal accommodation and attempting to engage in \ndiscussions with the DOE towards that end. Despite these efforts, the DOE’s \ndiscrimination against and unequal treatment of Plaintiffs has been persistent and \nongoing. And instead of addressing Plaintiffs’ concerns, the DOE has retaliated \nagainst Plaintiffs. \n157.  On many occasions, Plaintiffs and their female athlete classmates, \nparents, and coaches have complained to the DOE and voiced their concerns about \nthe unfair treatment that female athletes have received at Campbell. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 44 of 67     PageID.44\n158.  The DOE and the Campbell administration have not addressed the \ncomplaints or concerns raised by the female athletes of Campbell. \n159.  Instead of addressing the female athletes’ serious concerns, the DOE \nand the Campbell administrators retaliated. For example, the DOE and the \nCampbell administrators, on at least three separate occasions, threatened to \n“cancel” the water polo team, the water polo season, or both. \n160.  The DOE and the Campbell administrators also retaliated by \nincreasing their scrutiny of, showing more hostility towards, and withholding \nresources, funding, coaching, and other support from the girls’ water polo program. \nFor example, the DOE and the Campbell administrators withheld funding by \nrefusing to sign a $1,000 grant that was given to the water polo program, which \nforced the program to seek assistance from a different non-profit organization. As \nanother example, shortly after one heated meeting among water polo athletes, their \nparents, and the Campbell Principal and Athletic Director, the Campbell \nadministrators informed the water polo athletes that about half of the program’s \npaperwork (e.g., doctor’s physical evaluation forms, parental consent forms) was \nmissing. Even though this paperwork had, in fact, been completed and submitted \nby the water polo athletes, the Campbell administrators told the water polo athletes \nthat they needed to resubmit all of these forms. \n  42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 45 of 67     PageID.45\nB. Inaction \n \n161.  On February 9, 2018, the ACLU of Hawaii sent a letter to various \nDOE officials—including Superintendent Christina Kishimoto, Assistant \nSuperintendent for School Facilities and Support Services Dann Carlson, and Civil \nRights Compliance Office Director Anne Marie Puglisi—regarding sex \ndiscrimination against female athletes in Hawaii. Among other things, the letter \nnoted that fourteen DOE high schools “do not have athletic locker rooms for \nfemale students, while having such facilities for male students.” \n162.  The letter requested that, by March 12, 2018, the DOE respond with \n“a plan that concretely addresses the glaring inequality between girls’ and boys’ \nathletic facilities in DOE schools.” The letter also requested that that plan ensure \nthat DOE schools become “fully compliant with Title IX by the first day of the \n2018-19 school year.” \n163.  On March 2, 2018, the DOE sponsored three 45-minute-long meetings \nat Campbell in which representatives from each of the Campbell girls’ sports \nprograms met with Title IX compliance specialists from the DOE’s Civil Rights \nCompliance Office to raise concerns about gender equity in athletics.23 \n                                              \n23 The DOE’s Civil Rights Compliance Office was recently renamed the \n“Civil Rights Compliance Branch.” See \nhttp://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/ConnectWithUs/Organization/OfficesAndBra\nnches/Pages/CRCO.aspx. \n  43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 46 of 67     PageID.46\n164.  The ACLU of Hawaii represented some of the students and parents at \nthe March 2, 2018 meetings. \n165.  Upon information and belief, the DOE has not made any meaningful \nchanges to the athletics program at Campbell or other DOE schools in response to \nthese March 2, 2018 meetings and/or other similar meetings held at other DOE \nschools. \n166.  The ACLU of Hawaii repeatedly requested that the DOE share its past \nand present Title IX compliance plans and policies, including its written plan to \naddress the inequities described in the February 9, 2018 demand letter. \n167.  Concerned by the DOE’s failure to provide meaningful information \nabout its Title IX compliance findings, plans, and processes, the ACLU of Hawaii \nturned to public records requests under the Uniform Information Practices Act \n(“UIPA”) to obtain information on the DOE’s past and present Title IX compliance \nefforts. In response to these requests, the ACLU of Hawaii received few \ndocuments and little clarity about the DOE’s Title IX compliance efforts.  \n168.  More specifically, on July 12, 2018, the ACLU of Hawaii submitted a \nUIPA request seeking information regarding (1) Campbell’s athletic facilities, \nincluding their use by sport and gender; (2) Campbell’s athletic budgets, including \nline items broken down by team and gender; (3) DOE policies and plans regarding \nathletic budgeting and financial decision-making; (4) findings, conclusions, and \n  44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 47 of 67     PageID.47\nrecommendations from the gender equity assessments and site visits that the DOE \npurported to conduct in or around March 2018; (5) enrollment data by gender and \ngender participation rates in athletic programs; and (6) other plans and policies to \nremedy already-identified and future gender-based disparities. \n169.  In response to this July 12, 2018 request, the DOE provided very few \ndocuments, some of which were publicly available, and almost all of which \nprovided insufficient detail. In fact, excluding coaching payroll data, the DOE \nprovided only four documents, totaling nine pages. One of these documents was a \npublicly available campus map. Another was a 1.5-page document purporting to be \na “System of Self-Assessment, Reporting, and Monitoring” for Title IX \ncompliance in DOE athletic programs. Notably, the DOE withheld all records \nrelating to the March 2018 assessments and site visits and its plans to remedy \nalready-identified gender-based disparities “due to government frustration.” The \nDOE also redacted all names from the payroll data it provided, even though H.R.S. \n§ 92F-12(a)(14) requires the disclosure of, among other things, the name and \ncompensation of state employees. Despite the paucity of records provided by the \nDOE, it nevertheless affirmed that “[e]very record found to be responsive [wa]s \nprovided in its entirety.” \n170.  On August 27, 2018, the ACLU of Hawaii submitted a second UIPA \nrequest again seeking more information regarding (1) features and dimensions of \n  45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 48 of 67     PageID.48\nCampbell’s athletic facilities; (2) Campbell’s athletic rosters; (3) the names, \npositions, and compensation of all athletic staff at Campbell; and (4) the DOE’s \npolicies and procedures regarding athletic coaching. \n171.  In response to this August 27, 2018 request, the DOE provided three \ndocuments and one spreadsheet: a document with architectural plans for Campbell, \na document containing payroll data showing the names of the athletic staff, a \nspreadsheet outlining DOE’s athletic position pay rates, and an “Athletic \nHandbook” dated June 2009. The DOE also provided partially redacted rosters. \n172.  In sum, despite multiple attempts through several different avenues, \nthe DOE continues to place the issues of Title IX compliance and gender equity \nwithin a black box that is shielded from public scrutiny. \n173.  The discrimination against the female athletes of Campbell persists \ntoday in the midst of the fifth month of the 2018-19 school year. \n174.  The DOE, through its actions and omissions—and the actions and \nomissions of its officials, employees, and agents, including the OIA—has engaged \nand continues to engage in gender-based discrimination against girls who desire to \nplay scholastic competitive-level sports for Campbell. \n175.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to end Defendants’ ongoing and \nsystematic violations of the basic civil rights of girls who participate, or desire to \nparticipate, in the Campbell athletics program. \n  46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 49 of 67     PageID.49\n176.  As discussed above, these violations are symptomatic of pervasive, \nsystemic and longstanding practices and policies of Defendants that deny girls an \nequal opportunity to participate in athletic programs and enjoy the breadth of \neducational, health, and professional benefits that flow from such participation. \nIV.  The Effects of the Unequal Treatment and Opportunities for Female \nAthletes \n \n177.  Plaintiffs are under no obligation to show particular negative effects to \nprove Title IX violations. \n178.  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs take this opportunity to assert the harms they \nhave suffered. Defendants’ unequal treatment has many negative consequences on \nPlaintiffs’ academic performance, athletic performance, family obligations, and \nability to obtain athletic scholarships for college. \n179.  Additionally, because of Defendants’ unlawful treatment, Plaintiffs \nbelieve they and fellow female athletes are valued less—that they are second-class. \nIndeed, as one court has found, the practice of providing such unequal treatment \n“sends the clear message that female athletes are subordinate to their male \ncounterparts, and that girls’ sports take a backseat to boys’ sports.” Communities \nfor Equity v. Michigan High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 178 F. Supp. 2d 805, 836 (W.D. \nMich. 2001), aff’d, 459 F.3d 676 (6th Cir. 2006). Similarly, in the 2010 lawsuit \nconcerning Maui’s Baldwin High School, Judge Ezra elaborated on how “the \npsychological aspects” of gender inequities “are huge for girls”: \n  47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 50 of 67     PageID.50\nWhen these boys run out on that stadium field, they have a sense of \npride. It fills them with a sense that they have accomplished \nsomething. When a girl is relegated to running out on a dirt field in \nsome park, are they filled with the same kind of pride? I don’t think \nso. And I don’t think it takes a genius to figure out those differences.24 \n \n180.  Because of the inequities perpetuated by Defendants, Campbell also \nloses out on opportunities to host games, tournaments, and other competitions for \ngirls’ sports, which further negatively impacts female athletes’ educational and \nathletic experiences. \n181.  Additionally, the poor treatment results in Campbell female athletes \nfailing to achieve their full athletic potential, and thereby losing out on \nopportunities to win scholarships for post-secondary education. \n182.  For example, because of the consistent manner in which the DOE fails \nto provide or delays providing a pool in which to practice, A.B., T.T., and their \nteammates are deprived of opportunities to practice in regulation water polo \nconditions, and to practice the specific skills required to excel as water polo \nathletes. Similarly, because of the consistent manner in which the DOE unlawfully \ndiscriminates in providing sufficient and high-quality coaching—thereby leading \nto frequent changes in coaching staff—A.B., T.T., and their teammates constantly \nhave to form new relationships and adapt to each coach’s communication and \n                                              \n24 Nobriga v. Dep’t of Educ., State of Hawaii, 1:10-cv-159-DAE-LK, Doc. \n37, at 34 (D. Haw. Apr. 7, 2010). \n  48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 51 of 67     PageID.51\ncoaching style. This further prevents A.B., T.T., and their teammates from \nreaching their full potential as water polo athletes. \n183.  As another example, T.T.’s negative experience with the Campbell \nathletics program has put her collegiate scholarship opportunities at risk. As a \nsophomore, T.T. was one of Hawaii’s top high school water polo athletes. As a \njunior, T.T. aspired again to be one of the state’s top athletes. College scouts \nreached out to her expressing interest in her athletic abilities. But T.T.’s aspirations \nwere severely hampered by the DOE’s failure to timely provide access to a pool \nfor the Campbell girls’ water polo program during the 2017-18 school year. By the \ntime the water polo season had started, the team had not yet set foot in a pool for \npractice because the DOE had failed to secure a pool for the program. Thrown off \nby the inability to practice in a pool, the Campbell girls’ water polo team lost two \nof its first four games. As a result of the DOE’s inequitable treatment of the girls’ \nwater polo team, T.T. could not perform as well as she would have liked. T.T. \nmissed out on improving her water polo play statistics, which are important to \ncollege scouts. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n184.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n  49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 52 of 67     PageID.52\n185.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and on \nbehalf of a class of all those similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nDefinition \n186.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all present and future Campbell \nfemale students and potential students who participate, seek to participate, and/or \nare or were deterred from participating in athletics at Campbell (the “Class”). \nNumerosity \n187.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  \n188.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that in \nthe 2017-18 school year, the latest time period during which information is \npublicly available, there were 1,506 female students in grades 9-12 at Campbell \nand approximately 345 female students in the athletics program. \n189.  It is unknown how many additional current female students or how \nmany additional future female students would seek to participate in interscholastic \nathletics if additional opportunities were available. Moreover, members of the \nClass who may suffer future injury are not capable of being precisely identified at \nthis time, as the Class includes future Campbell female athletes. Upon information \nand belief, accordingly, class members number in the hundreds and possibly \nthousands. \n  50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 53 of 67     PageID.53\nCommon Questions of Law and Fact \n190.  Common questions of law and fact predominate, and include: (a) \nwhether current and future female student athletes at Campbell are receiving \nunequal treatment and benefits in comparison to the male student athletes; (b) \nwhether current and future female students at Campbell are being deprived of \nequal opportunities to participate in interscholastic sports; and (c) whether current \nand future female students at Campbell are being retaliated against for complaining \nabout sex discrimination. \nTypicality \n191.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the \nClass. The type of discrimination and retaliation that Plaintiffs have suffered as a \nresult of sex include: receipt of unequal treatment and benefits in Campbell’s \nsports programs in addition to exclusion from opportunities to participate in sports \nprograms at Campbell.  Such discrimination is typical of the sex discrimination \nthat members of the Class have suffered, are suffering, and, unless this Court \ngrants relief, will continue to suffer. \n192.  A.B. is a typical member of the proposed class. She is a current \nfemale student athlete at Campbell for the 2018-19 school year who is subject to \ndiscriminatory unequal participation opportunities due to Defendants’ failure to \naccommodate female students’ athletic interests and abilities as well as provide \n  51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 54 of 67     PageID.54\nequal treatment and benefits to female student athletes. Defendants have subjected \nA.B. to sex-based discrimination. \n193.  T.T. is a typical member of the proposed class. She is a current female \nstudent athlete at Campbell for the 2018-19 school year who is subject to \ndiscriminatory unequal participation opportunities due to Defendants’ failure to \naccommodate female students’ athletic interests and abilities as well as provide \nequal treatment and benefits to female student athletes. Defendants have subjected \nT.T. to sex-based discrimination. \nAdequacy of Representation \n194.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect \nthe interests of the Class because they seek relief on behalf of the Class they \nrepresent as a whole and have no interest antagonistic to other members of the \nClass. Plaintiffs intend to prosecute this action rigorously in order to secure \nremedies for the entire class. \n195.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by counsel from the ACLU of \nHawaii; Legal Aid at Work; and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. Counsel are \nexperienced in state and federal civil rights litigation and class actions, including \nspecifically Title IX class action litigation. \nRule 23(b)(2) \n  52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 55 of 67     PageID.55\n196.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final declaratory and injunctive \nrelief with respect to the Class as a whole under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n197.  An actual and immediate controversy exists between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants, which parties have genuine and opposing interests and which interests \nare direct and substantial. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants violated their rights \nand the rights of the Class under federal anti-discrimination law. Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe and, based thereon, allege that Defendants deny these \nallegations. Declaratory relief is therefore necessary and appropriate. \n198.  Plaintiffs and the class members have no plain, adequate, or complete \nremedy at law. Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to infringe \non Plaintiffs’ and class members’ statutory rights and will continue to inflict \nirreparable injury. This threat of injury to Plaintiffs and class members from \ncontinuing violations requires permanent injunctive relief. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 \net seq. and Its Implementing Regulations \n(Unequal Treatment and Benefits in Athletic Programs) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n  53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 56 of 67     PageID.56\n199.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n200.  Title IX provides: “No person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .” 20 U.S. C. § \n1681(a).  \n201.  Since the passage of Title IX, the DOE has received and continues to \nreceive federal financial assistance and the benefits therefrom. Therefore, all of the \nDOE’s programs, including its athletic programs, and all officials, employees \nand/or agents of the DOE, are bound by the requirements of Title IX and its \nimplementing regulations. 20 U.S.C. § 1687. This includes the OIA, which both is \na part of, and controls, the DOE’s athletic programs. \n202.  Title IX’s implementing regulations provide: “No person shall, on the \nbasis of sex, . . . be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another \nperson or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, \nclub or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and the recipient shall provide \nany such athletics separately on such basis.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a).  \n203.  Under Title IX, schools must provide “equal treatment and benefits” \nto members of both sexes in their athletic programs. 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (1979), \nthe Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights’ 1979 Policy Interpretation \n  54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 57 of 67     PageID.57\n(“1979 Policy Interpretation”). Equal treatment and benefits are assessed based on \nan overall comparison of the male and female student athletic programs, including \nan analysis of the following factors, among other considerations: “The provision of \nequipment and supplies; Scheduling of games and practice time; Opportunity to \nreceive coaching . . .; Assignment and compensation of coaches . . .; Provision of \nlocker rooms, practice and competitive facilities; Provision of medical and training \nfacilities and services; . . . Publicity” and a school’s “failure to provide necessary \nfunds for teams for one sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)–(10). See also Ollier v. \nSweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 858 F. Supp. 2d 1093, 1115 (S.D. Cal. 2012), \nenforced, No. 07CV714-L JMA, 2014 WL 1028431 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 17, 2014), \naff’d, 768 F.3d 843 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding “[d]efendants have violated Title IX in \nfailing to provide equal treatment and benefits,” with respect to plaintiffs’ \ntreatment and benefits claim). \n204.  The Title IX implementing regulations required that sponsors of \ninterscholastic athletics comply with the regulations within three years of their \neffective date, or by July 21, 1978, at the latest. The regulations further require that \nsponsors of interscholastic athletics take such remedial actions as are necessary to \novercome the effects of sex discrimination in violation of Title IX. 34 C.F.R. \n§106.3(a). \n  55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 58 of 67     PageID.58\n205.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that \nDefendants have not taken remedial actions and that any remedial actions which \nDefendants have taken in the past have been insufficient to satisfy Defendants’ \nobligations under Title IX. \n206.  Defendants have violated Title IX and its implementing regulations by \ndiscriminating against female students, including Plaintiffs, by, among other \nthings, failing to provide female student athletes from Campbell with treatment and \nbenefits that are comparable to the treatment and benefits provided to male student \nathletes. \n207.  Defendants’ inequitable treatment of Campbell female athletes \ndemonstrates Defendants’ failure to comply with Title IX. \n208.  As a proximate result of these unlawful acts, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave suffered and continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n209.  Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to relief, including declaratory \nrelief and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 \net seq. and Its Implementing Regulations \n(Unequal Participation Opportunities in Athletic Programs) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n  56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 59 of 67     PageID.59\n210.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n211.  Title IX provides: “No person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participating in . . . or be subjected to discrimination under any \neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S. C. § \n1681(a). \n212.  Title IX’s implementing regulations provide: “No person shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, . . . or otherwise be discriminated \nagainst in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered \nby a recipient, and the recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such \nbasis.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a). \n213.  Under Title IX, schools must provide both sexes equivalent athletic \nparticipation opportunities. See 1979 Policy Interpretation. \n214.  “In determining whether equal opportunities are available,” it must be \nconsidered, “[w]hether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively \naccommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes” 34 C.F.R. § \n106.41(c)(1); see also Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 604 F. Supp. 2d \n1264, 1275 (S.D. Cal. 2009), aff’d, 768 F.3d 843 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding \n“defendants are not in compliance with Title IX based on unequal participation \n  57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 60 of 67     PageID.60\nopportunities in athletic program,” with respect to plaintiffs’ unequal participation \nopportunities claim). \n215.  Compliance in the area of equivalent participation opportunities is \ndetermined by a three-part test. \n216.  The first part of the test considers: “Whether intercollegiate level \nparticipation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers \nsubstantially proportionate to their respective enrollments[.]” Id. at 71,418 (Section \nVII(C)(5)(a)(1)). \n217.  The second part of the test considers: “Where the members of one sex \nhave been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, whether the \ninstitution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which \nis demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of the members \nof that sex[.]” Id. at 71,418 (Section VII(C)(5)(a)(2)). \n218.  The third part of the test considers: “Where the members of one sex \nare underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the institution cannot \nshow a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above, whether \nit can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex \nhave been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.” Id. at \n71,418 (Section VII(C)(5)(a)(3)). \n  58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 61 of 67     PageID.61\n219.  Although the 1979 Policy Interpretation refers to “intercollegiate” \nsports, it also applies to high schools. See Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. \nDist., 768 F.3d 843, 855 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[T]he three-part test applies to a high \nschool.”); see also McCormick ex rel. McCormick v. School Dist. of Mamaroneck, \n370 F.3d 275, 300 (2d Cir. 2004) (applying three-part test to high school). Indeed, \nTitle IX is applicable to all recipients of federal education funds, including high \nschools, and thus the 1979 Policy Interpretation is applicable to interscholastic \nhigh school sports as well as intercollegiate sports. 34 C.F.R. § 106.11. \n220.  With respect to the first part of the three-part test, Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the ratio of female to male \nathletes at Campbell is not substantially proportionate to the overall ratio of \nenrolled female to male students at Campbell. \n221.  Further, with respect to the second part of the three-part test, \nDefendants cannot show “a history and continuing practice of program expansion \nwhich is demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities” of \nCampbell’s female students. Mansourian v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 602 F.3d \n958, 965 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Office for Civil Rights, Guidance: The Three-Part \nTest (1996)). Rather, female students have historically been and continue to be \nunderrepresented in the Campbell and DOE athletics programs. Defendants bear \nthe burden on part two, an affirmative defense, and must show a history and \n  59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 62 of 67     PageID.62\ncontinuing practice of adding athletic opportunities for females. See Ollier v. \nSweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 768 F.3d 843, 857-58 (9th Cir. 2014). \n222.  Finally, with respect to part three of the three-part test, despite this \nunderrepresentation and despite the interests and abilities of female students at \nCampbell to participate on additional teams, Defendants have not adequately met \nthe interests and abilities of female student-athletes. \n223.  As a proximate result of these unlawful acts, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave suffered and continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n224.  Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to relief, including declaratory \nrelief and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n225.  Such injunctive relief may include, but is not limited to, the provision \nof the full range of teams and participation slots in existing sports, with teams for \nall grade levels, including novice, junior varsity, and varsity-level opportunities for \nfemale student athletes. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 \net seq. and Its Implementing Regulations \n(Retaliation) \n(Against Defendant DOE Only) \n \n226.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n  60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 63 of 67     PageID.63\n227.  Title IX and its implementing regulations prohibit retaliation for \ncomplaints of sex discrimination. See Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 \nU.S. 167, 171 (2005); Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 768 F.3d 843, \n869 (9th Cir. 2014). \n228.  On several occasions, Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other Class \nmembers complained to the DOE about its unequal treatment of the Campbell \ngirls’ water polo program. These complaints were submitted in both oral and \nwritten form.  \n229.  Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other Class members also engaged in \nboth individual and entire-team meetings with the Campbell Principal and Athletic \nDirector to discuss this unequal treatment. During these meetings, Plaintiffs A.B. \nand T.T. and other Class members—sometimes with their parents—expressed \nconcern about the inequitable way that the DOE treated the Campbell girls’ water \npolo program, as evidenced most strikingly by the DOE’s continual failure to \ntimely secure a practice facility for the team. \n230.  After Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other Class members complained \nabout the DOE’s sex discrimination, the DOE retaliated by threatening, on at least \nthree separate occasions, to “cancel” the water polo program, the water polo \nseason, or both. As noted above, on at least one occasion, the Campbell Athletic \n  61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 64 of 67     PageID.64\nDirector joked that, if the water polo program was going to lose a game, Campbell \nshould not even have a water polo program. \n231.  Upon information and belief, after Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other \nClass members complained about the DOE’s sex discrimination, the DOE \nretaliated by increasing its scrutiny of, and showing more hostility towards, the \nCampbell girls’ water polo program. This includes the DOE’s instruction that \nCampbell water polo athletes resubmit athletic paperwork that the athletes had \nalready submitted, as noted above. \n232.  Upon information and belief, after Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other \nClass members complained about the DOE’s sex discrimination, the DOE also \nretaliated by deliberately withholding resources, funding, coaching, and other \nsupport from the girls’ water polo program that it otherwise would have provided \nhad Plaintiffs and other Class members not lodged complaints. This includes the \nwithholding of funding by refusing to sign a $1,000 grant, as noted above. \n233.  Also, as a result of the DOE’s retaliatory acts, Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. \nand other Class members are concerned that the DOE will retaliate again if they \ncontinue to complain about the DOE’s sex discrimination. Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. \nand other Class members are dissuaded from raising the issue of sex discrimination \nwith the DOE. \n  62 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 1   Filed 12/06/18   Page 65 of 67     PageID.65\n234.  The DOE’s retaliatory acts have also created a chilling effect among \nCampbell’s female athletes regarding identifying and complaining about other \ngender inequities in athletics to the DOE. \n235.  The DOE’s retaliatory acts were motivated by Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. \nand other Class members lodging their complaints of sex discrimination. \n236.  As a proximate result of these unlawful acts, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave suffered and continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n237.  Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to relief, including declaratory \nrelief and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the other class members pray that this Court: \nA.  Assume jurisdiction over this action; \nB.  Certify the Class as proposed above, appoint the named Plaintiffs to \nserve as representatives of the Class, and appoint undersigned \ncounsel to represent the Class; \nC.

Approach \nA.   The Independent Evaluator and Standards to be Used. \nThis is a Title IX Compliance Plan (“Plan”) for James Campbell High School (“Campbell \nHigh School”) and the State of Hawai‘i, Department of Education (“DOE”) and the Oahu \nInterscholastic Association (“OIA”) as it affects Campbell High School. It is intended to assist, \nfacilitate, and ensure Campbell High School’s compliance with Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 (“Title IX”). To accomplish this, an Independent Evaluator (“IE”) with \nsubstantial knowledge and experience in evaluating and bringing educational institutions into \ncompliance with Title IX shall be retained to inspect, gather data, evaluate, report and make \nrecommendations to ensure Campbell High School is in and maintains compliance with Title IX.  \nThe IE shall be compensated by the DOE. The IE is neutral and independent. The IE’s \nwork shall be fair, neutral, and objective, free from any bias, prejudice, or influence. While the \nIE welcomes constructive criticism and suggestions as to additional areas to explore, the IE will \nnot be directed or influenced by counsel for any party to reach or change a conclusion or any of \nthe underlying data or information. The IE will follow the Title IX law, guidelines, and prior \ninvestigations conducted at the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”). \nThe IE shall utilize and apply relevant Title IX law and guidance, including but not \nlimited to the implementing regulations for Title IX found at 34 C.F.R. Part 106, OCR’s 1979 \nTitle IX Policy Interpretation with regard to Intercollegiate Athletics, its 1990 Title IX Athletics \nInvestigator’s Manual, its 1996 Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: \nThree-Part Test, its 2003 Dear Colleague Letter: Further Clarification of Intercollegiate \nAthletics Policy Guidance Regarding Title IX Compliance, its 2008 Dear Colleague Letter: \nAthletic Activities Counted for Title IX Compliance, its 2010 Dear Colleague Letter: \nIntercollegiate Athletics Policy Clarification: The Three-Part Test – Part Three, and its 2013 \nDear Colleague Letter: Students with Disabilities in Extracurricular Athletics, as well as \nupdated OCR resolution agreements and other related materials. The IE will also monitor Ninth \nCircuit precedent, as well as other federal cases related to Title IX and gender equity. Both the \nPlaintiffs and Defendants DOE and the OIA (collectively “Defendants”) are invited to share \nrelevant cases and reference materials on an ongoing basis for consideration by the IE. \nB.   Methodology and Approach \n1.  Document Collection & Organizational Tool Building \nThe IE shall promptly set up and implement a data collection procedure, and collect all \nrequested data related to each of the relevant categories listed in Section II of this Plan. There are \ntypically several data requests for each component, e.g., final rosters from the previous year, \nsquad lists for upcoming years, a review of relevant non-discrimination policies and processes to \nstart sports, equipment lists by team, schedules and anticipated travel (including means of travel \nand related amenities like hotels if relevant), staffing for each coaching position by team, related \nA-1 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n{00661993.DOCX} \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 17 of 31  PageID.5176\n \n \ndetails about coaching salaries and amenities, academic support for athletes, facility surveys to \nbe utilized by local staff, medical and training resources, publicity and marketing resources and \nanticipated expenditures, and a range of other materials. This list will be attached to the Interim \nReport and Annual Report, along with annotations related to any data issues or timing issues. \nThe data collected regarding fall and winter sports participation rates also will be available to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel as an Interim Report following the end of winter sports at Campbell High \nSchool. \nThe IE will communicate with Campbell High School and OIA staff prior to circulating \nthe data request to understand what data they already collect, how they collect such data, and \nhow it would be helpful to collect such data moving forward. The Annual Report will be \nmodeled after OCR Resolution Letters1 and will include qualitative and quantitative assessments \nof the Title IX athletic participation and treatment and benefits elements. The IE will seek to \ncollect information consistent with the “templates” drafted and utilized by Plaintiffs’ expert \nDonna Lopiano, Ph.D. (“Dr. Lopiano”) in her May 17, 2023 expert report (“Lopiano Report”), \nAppendices L-CC. The Annual Report for this review will incorporate substantive feedback \norganized by component for the entire program and include every element of the component, as \ndescribed and exemplified by OCR. The IE shall consider Dr. Lopiano’s analysis and input and \nthey will be considered as data points. The IE will also be open to feedback from all Parties for \nsubsequent reports. \nThe Interim Reports shall include fall and winter sports team rosters, and other \ncomponent-related data that will be sought in the IE’s data request. The IE will provide that data \nin a shared data file to be agreed upon by the Parties, (e.g., Box, Dropbox, SharePoint, or similar \nstorage service). Any storage service chosen should be available to all, and the IE will maintain \nadministrator rights to ensure documents are not altered or removed without permission. The IE \nwill make this data and analysis available at regular intervals, e.g., the last Friday in January and \nJuly, respectively. \n2.  Prong Three Efforts  \nAt the same time as the data request process in Section I.A develops, the IE will begin \ndiscussions with Campbell High School and OIA staff regarding their efforts to assess girls’ \ninterest in playing sports in greater numbers. The IE will assist Campbell High School and the \nOIA to develop and execute an appropriate survey for Campbell High School and relevant \nmiddle school students, begin conversations with local staff and local league officials, as well as \nother individuals familiar with local sports (including club sports) to begin assessing and \nresponding to girls’ interest as Title IX’s Prong Three element requires. The IE will use as his \nguide the OCR’s April 20, 2010 Dear Colleague Letter Regarding the Three-Part Test and its \ndiscussion of multiple indicators to assess interest. The IE will also utilize the sample survey \nprovided in Appendix J of the Lopiano Report, but the IE reserves the right to tailor the survey \nto Campbell High School and Hawaii athletics. \nThe survey results will be shared with the Parties by or before January 31, 2024. After \n                                                      \n1 See, e.g., OCR letter to Rutgers University, 02-08-6001 (2015). \n{00661993.DOCX}A-2 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v.

The final survey and results will also be appended to \nthe Annual Report and will include response rates, data trends, and other relevant factors that \nOCR would consider in assessing a survey. The IE will conduct this survey and assessment of \ngirls’ interest on an annual basis. A discussion of all parts of Title IX’s three-part test will also \nbe included in the Annual Report. \n3.  Coach Surveys and Interviews  \nIn the fall-winter, the IE will conduct surveys and interviews of the head coaches of each \nteam to ask about the athletic benefits for each team. The areas to be reviewed with each coach \nwill be based on the areas listed in Section II, and interviews may be conducted in-person or via \nvideoconference (e.g., Zoom, Teams). The IE will summarize information about these \ndiscussions to be reported in the Interim and Annual Report in a way that will be independent, \ntransparent, and not sacrifice interviewee candor. Section II.B.5 describes the privacy concerns \nthat may arise in either coach or student interviews. Coach surveys and/or interviews are \ndesigned to test the data shared by Campbell High School to better understand how the sport in \nquestion operates on a practical level. This information will be incorporated into each component \nof the Interim and Annual Report, as relevant. \n4.  Student-Athlete Meetings, Focus Groups, and Community Feedback \nThe IE will visit Campbell High School in or before December 2023 for the primary \npurpose of interviewing coaches who wish to interview in person versus via videoconference, as \ndescribed above, and, more importantly, conducting meetings and/or focus groups with interested \nstudents. These meetings and focus group opportunities will be provided, as appropriate, for both \nparents and students and publicized beforehand. \nThe IE will summarize information about these discussions to be reported in the Interim \nand Annual Report in a way that will be independent, transparent, and not sacrifice interviewee \ncandor. Section II.B.5 describes the privacy concerns that may arise in such interviews. This \ninformation will be incorporated into each component of the Interim and Annual Report, as \nrelevant. \nThe IE will also utilize the December 2023 visit to speak with members of the OIA, the \nHawaii legislature (if requested), the DOE, or others related to the creation of new sports (such \nas club sports team leaders), additional funding, or other review-related issues that may arise. \n5.  Facility Review \nIn December 2023, the IE and Plaintiffs’ counsel from the ACLU of Hawai‘i will conduct \na site visit to the new Campbell High School athletic field and track and any associated facilities \nsuch as restrooms, concession stands, and/or locker rooms).  In May or June of 2024, the IE will \nreturn to Campbell High School to conduct a site review over two (2) days to include off-site \n{00661993.DOCX}A-3 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v.

If the \nIE conducts additional interviews with students, coaches, or staff he will provide his notes to \ncounsel in accordance with sections I.3. and I.4. above.  Counsel for all Parties shall be permitted \nto attend this site visit as well as subsequent annual site visits.  \nAt the May/June 2024 site visit and subsequent annual site visits, Plaintiffs shall limit the \nnumber of counsel attending to three (3) with no more than one (1) traveling from the mainland. If \nthe circumstances warrant it, the Parties will meet and confer to discuss the attendance at the site \nvisit by additional people.  The IE will work with both Parties to schedule this visit well in \nadvance so that all Parties may attend, particularly regarding the facility review. Rather than \nhaving multiple photographers, the Parties shall agree to a mutually acceptable photographer to \nbe appointed in advance so the IE can discuss the approach of the photographer and map out the \nsite inspection. All photographs will be labeled by facility and placed in a shared repository, as \nwell as any photographs taken by the IE2 The Parties are welcome to take their own photographs, \nbut all such photographs will also be incorporated into the shared repository within a reasonable \ntime period (within five (5) business days) following the review. The Parties agree that someone \nlocal should be chosen as the official photographer so that they may return to Campbell High \nSchool (or offsite facilities used by Campbell High School athletes) if any additional \nphotographs or photographic angles are requested.   \n6.  Privacy Concerns  \nInterviewing athletes, coaches, and related staff (e.g., trainers, administrative personnel \netc.) is a critical component of the IE reviews. The IE will provide copies of these notes to \ncounsel upon request. Counsel will discuss and attempt to reach an agreement on whether all or \nany portion of the notes should be made available to the public. If an agreement cannot be \nreached, the dispute resolution clause contained in the Agreement shall be followed.  \nII.  Interim and Annual Compliance Report \nThe IE will provide Interim Reports by the last Friday in January and Annual Reports by \nthe last Friday in July for each year of the Compliance and Monitoring Period. The first Interim \nReport will be provided in January 2024.  Each Interim Report, unless otherwise specified, will \nprovide an update as to the efforts outlined in this Plan but will not make compliance \ndeterminations and may be concise. An example of additional information included is the interest \nand ability survey referenced in Section I.B.  The January 2024 Interim Report also will provide \n                                                      \n2 The IE would only direct Campbell High School staff to take such photographs if a specific \nevent was at issue and the photographs had a time or context-specific aspect. This should not \napply to any photograph taken in any way by Campbell High School staff over the course of the \nacademic year. For example, if Campbell High School improved signage on a facility during the \nyear, the IE may ask a member of the staff to photograph the field before and after the new \nsignage is to be installed to maintain a record. Otherwise, the preference will be that the mutually \nagreed upon photographer will take most compliance-related photographs.  Any such \nphotographs taken by staff also will be promptly uploaded into the central repository.  \n{00661993.DOCX}A-4 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 20 of 31  PageID.5179\n \n \ninformation about the December 2023 site visit (described in Section I.B.5).  \nEach Annual Report will comprehensively assess Title IX compliance for the most \nrecently concluded academic year at Campbell High School and utilize student population and \nathletic participation statistics for that same year, absent extenuating circumstances (like a global \npandemic). This Annual Report will incorporate relevant data to demonstrate compliance and/or \ncompliance challenges. Each Annual Report will incorporate appropriate site visits and \ninterviews with Campbell High School staff and leadership, as well as other individual \ninterviews requested by the IE, (e.g., potentially members of the DOE and/or representatives \nfrom the OIA). Similarly, the Annual Report will, as appropriate, incorporate interviews and/or \nfocus groups and/or survey data from students.   \nThe IE will conduct this review and draft the Interim and Annual Report consistent with \nhis experience at OCR. With respect to each of the components listed below in Section III, the IE \nwill promptly raise any athletics gender equity concerns with Campbell High School, the DOE, \nand/or the OIA.  If the IE recommends gender equity changes, Campbell High School and \nDefendants will implement the changes promptly.  These concerns, requests and the related \noutcomes will be described in the Interim and Annual Reports. The IE shall also highlight any \nsignificant compliance challenges and will advise Campbell High School and Defendants of such \nchallenges as they are learned and before the Annual Report is completed so that they can be \nremediated.   Campbell High School and Defendants shall follow the complaint reporting \nprocedure set forth in Section III below, and any reports shall be provided to the IE on a monthly \nbasis and summarized in the Annual Report, including the issue raised and the date it was raised, \nthe steps taken to address the challenge, and the manner and date by which the issue was \nresolved.   \nThe IE will accept feedback from the Parties on each Interim and Annual Report and will \nseek to incorporate such feedback as relevant and appropriate into future reports. Similarly, the IE \nwill maintain records collected by Campbell High School and will make those available to the \nParties along with the Interim and Annual Reports. \nIII.  Content of the Annual Report \nThe IE’s Annual Report will include sections addressing each relevant component of a \nTitle IX review, as follows: \nA.  Participation  \nTitle IX requires that athletic participation opportunities be offered in a gender-equitable \nmanner and provides institutions with three independent and equally sufficient ways to \ndemonstrate compliance. This is referred to colloquially as the “Three-Part Test”: \n  Prong One: Whether interscholastic-level participation opportunities for male and \nfemale students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their \nrespective full-time undergraduate enrollments; or, \n{00661993.DOCX}A-5 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 21 of 31  PageID.5180\n \n \n  Prong Two: Where the members of one sex have been, and are underrepresented \namong interscholastic athletes, whether the institution has a history and continuing \npractice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing \ninterests and abilities of the underrepresented sex; or, \n  Prong Three: Where the members of one sex are underrepresented among \ninterscholastic athletes (i.e., Prong One), and the institution cannot show a \ncontinuing practice of program expansion (i.e., Prong Two), whether it can be \ndemonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of the \nunderrepresented sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the \ncurrent athletic program. \nThe IE will analyze and evaluate in each Annual Report whether Prong One or Prong \nThree compliance have been met for the recently concluded year in question. That is, for each \nreporting year, the IE will analyze Campbell High School’s full-time student population and \ncompare it to the sex-disaggregated athletic program in that same year, (i.e., if the full-time \nstudents are 48% male and 52% female, the athletic opportunities should be substantially \nproportionate to those measures).  \nAs a general matter, in assessing countable sports, institutions may only rely on \nparticipation opportunities provided in athletics activities deemed to be Title IX sport teams or \nemerging sports offered at other secondary or post-secondary schools. Under this standard, and \nhistoric with OCR’s interpretations, a cheerleading team would not count for Title IX purposes, \nbut a gymnastics or acrobatics team may, depending on the levels of competition and \ncompetitive schedule that may exist. These will be case-by-case decisions and will be made clear \nin the annual reports. \nIn relevant part, federal guidance defines an athletic participant as one: \n  who is receiving institutionally sponsored support normally provided to athletes \ncompeting at the institution involved (e.g., coaching, equipment, medical and \ntraining room services) on a regular basis during a sport’s season; and \n  who is participating in organized practice sessions and other team meetings and \nactivities on a regular basis during a sport’s season; and \n  who is listed on the squad lists maintained for each sport. \nConsistent with this definition, the IE will count those student-athletes listed on a team’s \nsquad list as of the team’s first date of competition and those student-athletes added during a \ntime when a sizable amount of countable competition remains, provided the student-athletes \ncontinue to participate on a regular basis. At the same time, student-athletes who are cut or who \nvoluntarily leave a team shortly after the first date of competition likely would not be credited, \nbut those determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis and any methodology used to \nmake this determination will be described in the Annual Report. The IE may make suggestions to \nCampbell High School to potentially limit or cap the sizes of the over-represented teams if it can \n{00661993.DOCX}A-6 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 22 of 31  PageID.5181\n \n \nbe done appropriately, but will not recommend reduction of boys’ athletic opportunities as the \nsole way to achieve Prong One compliance without adding additional girls’ opportunities.  \nTitle IX also requires schools to provide athletic competition for its male and female \nathletes that “equally reflects their abilities.” In this regard, the IE will review whether the \ncompetitive schedules for each gender’s teams, on a program-wide basis, afford proportionately \nsimilar numbers of male and female athletes equivalently advanced competitive opportunities. \nThe IE does not currently know what additional sport offerings for girls at Campbell \nHigh School may be appropriate.  The IE, Campbell High School, and Defendants will work \ntogether with Plaintiffs’ counsel to identify appropriate sports to add for girls once interest has \nbeen assessed initially and Campbell High School will add those sports and/or levels within a \nreasonable time.  The IE will also specifically assess the interest in girls’ water polo at Campbell \nHigh School and assist Campbell High School in taking the appropriate steps to meet or build \ninterest in the sport.   \nThe IE will provide the annual participation analysis, including the percentage disparity \nbetween the athletic program and the full-time student population, as well as the number of \nfemale student-athletes needed to fill any participation gap. This will be the “target number” that \nCampbell High School should focus upon for Prong One compliance. Girls’ interest in \nparticipating in sports in greater numbers also will be assessed, including the existence of any \nclub, junior varsity, or novice team participation rates, to guide Campbell High School in the \ncreation of teams or levels for the underrepresented gender.  The IE, Campbell High School, and \nDefendants will work together with Plaintiffs’ counsel to identify appropriate sports and/or levels \nto add for girls once interest has been assessed annually and Campbell High School will add \nthose sports and/or levels within a reasonable time. \nB.  Recruiting  \nThe IE will assess the following areas in regard to recruiting: (1) whether the coaches or \nother professional personnel in the programs serving male and female athletes are provided with \nsubstantially equal opportunities to recruit; (2) whether the financial and other resources made \navailable for recruitment in male and female athletic programs are equivalently adequate to meet \nthe needs of each program; and (3) whether the differences in benefits, opportunities, and \ntreatment afforded prospective student-athletes of each sex have a disproportionately limiting \neffect upon the recruitment of students of either sex.3 The IE would like to affirmatively \nacknowledge that “recruiting” at a secondary school is different than the standards for recruiting \nat the college or university level, insofar as Campbell High School does not have the ability to \nrecruit student-athletes from outside its district. Instead, the focus on recruiting may also involve \nassessments of how Campbell High School publicizes its current and any new athletic \nopportunities including at the feeder middle schools. See Section II.K, below.   \n                                                      \n3 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c) \n{00661993.DOCX}A-7 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 23 of 31  PageID.5182\n \n \nC.  Equipment and Supplies \nEquipment and supplies include but are not limited to uniforms, other apparel, sport-\nspecific equipment and supplies, general equipment and supplies, instructional devices, and \nconditioning and weight training equipment. The IE will assess compliance with this component \nby examining, among other factors, the equivalence for male and female athletes regarding (1) \nthe quality of equipment and supplies; (2) the amount of equipment and supplies; (3) the \nsuitability of equipment and supplies; (4) the maintenance and replacement of the equipment and \nsupplies; and (5) the availability of equipment and supplies.4 The IE quantities and quality of \nequipment and supplies, as provided by Campbell High School and as observed during annual \nsite visits. The IE will also interview and/or survey coaches and athletics staff to determine if \nthey have equipment and supplies consistent with their teams’ needs.   \nD.  Scheduling of Games and Practice Times  \nThe IE will assess compliance by examining, among other factors, the equivalence for \nmale and female athletes of (1) the number of competitive events per sport; (2) the number and \nlength of practice opportunities; (3) the time-of-day competitive events are scheduled; (4) the \ntime-of-day practice opportunities are scheduled; and (5) the opportunities to engage in available \npre-season and post-season competition.5 To the extent that Campbell High School has “prime \ntimes” for events, i.e., the opportunity to play under lights or at preferred Friday/weekend times, \nthe IE will highlight whether this creates a gender equity issue and propose potential solutions, \nunderstanding that such challenges may involve third parties not subject to the underlying \nlitigation.  \nE.  Travel and Per Diem \nThe IE will assess compliance regarding equitable travel and per diem practices by \nexamining, among other factors, the equivalence for male and female athletes of: (1) modes of \ntransportation; (2) housing furnished during travel (amount and quality), if relevant; (3) length of \nstay before and after competitive events; (4) per diem allowances; and (5) other dining \narrangements.6 As with recruiting, travel and per diem often looks different at the secondary \nversus post-secondary level. However, given Hawaii’s geographic location, this may be more of \na factor as student-athletes travel between islands and/or to the mainland.  \nF.  Coaching  \nThe IE will assess coaching by examining, among other factors, the equivalence in \navailability, assignment, and compensation of coaches as follows: (1) availability of coaches and \nassistant coaches (including volunteers); (2) training, experience and other professional \nqualifications and professional standing; and (3) compensation of coaches, including rate of \n                                                      \n4 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2). \n5 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(3). \n6 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(4). \n{00661993.DOCX}A-8 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 24 of 31  PageID.5183\n \n \ncompensation, duration of contracts, conditions relating to contract renewal, experience, nature of \ncoaching duties performed, working conditions, and other terms and conditions of employment.7 \nCompliance issues will be raised where the factors outlined above deny male and female \nathletes coaching of equivalent quality, nature, and/or availability. \nG.  Academic Support \nAs with the housing and dining (Section III.J), it is the IE’s understanding that Campbell \nHigh School does not provide focused academic support for student-athletes. The IE will \ndetermine whether this component needs to be reviewed at Campbell High School.8  \nH.  Locker Rooms, Practice Facilities, and Competitive Facilities \nThe IE will assess the following factors in evaluating the provision of equitable locker \nrooms, practice facilities, and competitive facilities for compliance: (1) quality and availability of \nthe facilities provided for practice and competitive interscholastic events; (2) exclusivity of use of \nfacilities provided for practice and competitive events; (3) availability of locker rooms; (4) quality \nof locker rooms; (5) maintenance of practice and competitive facilities; and (6) preparation of \nfacilities for practice and competitive events.9 With regard to this component, and all of the \ncomponents where it is relevant, the IE will use appropriate Title IX standards in comparing \nfacilities. \nI.  Medical and Training Facilities and Services \nThe IE will assess compliance with this component by considering the following factors: \n(1) availability of medical personnel and assistance; (2) health, accident, and injury insurance \ncoverage maintained by the institution; (3) availability and quality of training facilities; (4) \navailability and quality of weight training and conditioning facilities; and (5) availability and \nqualifications of athletic trainers.10  \nAs part of his assessment, the IE will assess the coverage of Campbell High Schools’ \nathletic health care trainers (“AHCT”) at its athletic events. Specifically with regard to girls’ \nvarsity water polo, the IE will review the DOE’s Coverage Guidelines for Athletic Events by \n                                                      \n7 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(5)-(6). The coaching discussion spreads over two \ncomponents, insofar as subsection (c)(5) addresses the “opportunity to receive” coaching, and \nsubsection (c)(6) addresses the “assignment and compensation” of coaches. \n8 If certain components are not relevant or provided based on Campbell High School’s athletic \nprogram, the IE may limit or eliminate such components from his review in future years after \nconsulting with counsel for the Parties. \n9 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(7). \n10 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(8). \n{00661993.DOCX}A-9 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 25 of 31  PageID.5184\n \n \nAthletic Health Care Trainers11, assess Campbell High School’s AHCT scheduling and coverage \nat girls’ water polo events, and determine whether additional coverage is needed.   \nJ.  Housing and Dining \nAs with the academic support (Section III.G), it is the IE’s understanding that Campbell \nHigh School does not offer any housing or dining facilities or services to its student-athletes \nwhich is common at the secondary level. The IE will determine whether this component needs to \nbe reviewed at Campbell High School.  \nK.  Publicity and Marketing \nThe IE will assess compliance regarding the provision of publicity and marketing by \nanalyzing the following factors: (1) availability and quality of sports information personnel; (2) \nquantity and quality of publications and other promotional sources featuring the boys’ and girls’ \nprograms; and (3) access to other publicity resources for boys’ and girl’s programs.12 This \ncomponent may be reported in tandem with the recruiting component.  \nL.  Support Services \nThe IE will assess compliance regarding this component by analyzing the following \nfactors: (1) the amount of administrative assistance provided to boys’ and girls’ programs; (2) the \namount of secretarial and clerical assistance provided to boys’ and girls’ programs; and (3) other \nrelated amenities provided to teams regarding the administration of their programs.13  \nM.  Fundraising \nThe IE will assess fundraising opportunities for male and female athletes to determine \nwhether they are gender equitable. \nIV.  Complaint Reporting Procedure and Review \nCampbell High School will create a reporting mechanism for student-athletes to report \nany gender equity concerns via a hotline and/or online portal maintained by Campbell High \nSchool. This complaint reporting mechanism also will be publicized to students, coaches, and \nparents in various DOE, OIA and Campbell High School-specific publications such as schedules, \nhandbooks, and training materials.   \nThese reports of complaints will be shared with the IE on a monthly basis, if not more \nfrequently. The IE will then: (1) assess the issue with the leadership of Campbell High School; \n(2) determine if the issue is actual or not; (3) discuss a potential remediation in the short term and \nthe long term; and then (4) receive updates until the issue is resolved. The IE will summarize \n                                                      \n11 The DOE’s Coverage Guidelines for Athletic Events by Athletic Health Care Trainers is \nincorporated as part of the DOE’s Athletic Handbook. \n12 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(10). \n13 See generally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c). \n{00661993.DOCX}A-10 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v. Hawaii, Case No. 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 312-1   Filed 10/27/23   Page 26 of 31  PageID.5185\n \n \nthese issues in a separate section of the Annual Report.  \nAny gender equity concerns shall be shared with the IE promptly. The IE will discuss \nsuch concerns with the appropriate member(s) of Campbell High School, the DOE, and/or the \nOIA, and a remediation plan will be established. The timeline of this process will be recorded in \nthe Annual Report. \nNote that this section does not supplement or supplant any non-discrimination policies or \nprocesses that are properly under the purview of the Hawaii Attorney General’s Office, the DOE, \nand/or Campbell High School. Similarly, any allegation of any form of sexual harassment or \nsexual misconduct learned by the IE during this review will be promptly referred to Campbell \nHigh School and not affirmatively addressed by the IE unless it significantly impacts a \ncomponent of this review, as set forth in Section II. The IE will inform interviewees that, if such \ninformation is raised, the IE is a designated mandatory reporter to Campbell High School, who \nmay appoint a staff member (e.g., its Title IX Coordinator) to receive such reports. \nV.  Training and Professional Development \nThe IE will provide annual Title IX athletics training to Campbell High School’s \nadministration and athletics leadership, including its athletic director, assistant athletic directors, \ntrainers, athletic department staff, and coaches. This training will also include representatives \nfrom the DOE and the OIA, as appropriate. The initial training shall be provided as soon as \npracticable after the Execution of the Agreement and may also provide an introduction to this \nreview.  The training will focus on compliance standards and updates in the field of gender \nequity in athletics including the anti-retaliation mandates of Title IX. The IE may also \nincorporate compliance tools specifically developed for Campbell High School into the training. \nWith the IE, the DOE will develop and incorporate a Title IX athletic training video into its \nrequired athletic training videos (such as the DOE Risk Management Video).  The IE will train \nthe Campbell High School Athletic Director to provide Title IX training to parents and student \nathletes at meetings Campbell High School conducts with student athletes and parents at the start \nof each season of sport.   \nVI.  Posting of Interim and Annual Reports \nThe Interim and Annual Reports will be posted publicly on DOE and OIA’s websites \n(including on Campbell High School’s website athletics page) within five (5) business days of \ncompletion.  Campbell High School and OIA shall announce the posting of the reports via their \nInstagram and X (formerly Twitter) feeds.  The IE may redact PII from the Interim and Annual \nReports.  The entire Interim and Annual Report will be shared with counsel.   \nVII.   Non-Retaliation Assurances \nNo individual should be retaliated against for cooperating with or facilitating the IE’s \nreview, responding to questions from the IE, or otherwise providing assistance or relevant \nmaterials to the IE. Likewise, there shall be no retaliation against anyone raising Title IX \ncomplaints.  All retaliation complaints shall be addressed through the Complaint Reporting \n{00661993.DOCX}A-11 \nCOMPLIANCE PLAN \nA.B. v.

Review of OIA Documents.  Within sixty (60) days of the Execution of the \nSettlement and Release Agreement (the “Agreement”), the Independent \nEvaluator (“IE”) shall review the Oahu Interscholastic Association’s \n(“OIA”) governance documents (i.e., Constitution, Bylaws, Handbook, and \nany other related documents) to assess what amendments/changes are \nnecessary for, or will help facilitate, ongoing compliance with the \nrequirements of Title IX, gender equity in athletics at James Campbell High \nSchool (“Campbell High School”), and the terms of the Compliance Plan \n(Exhibit A).  The IE shall propose any amendments/changes to the OIA \nBoard for formal approval and the OIA Executive Director shall advocate to \nthe OIA Board for approval of all IE recommendations.  \nB.  Assessment Forms.  The IE shall develop a Title IX assessment form that \nOIA-member schools shall be required to complete annually to maintain \n“Good Standing” as a condition of their continued membership in the OIA.  \nThis assessment form shall include information sufficient to identify \npossible and/or existing issues regarding gender equity in athletic \nparticipation opportunities and athletic treatment and benefits.  When the \nassessment forms are submitted, the IE shall review each assessment form \nfor gender inequities and use the information to help identify OIA-wide \nissues and advance recommendations that are better addressed at a \nconference-wide, rather than school-wide, level.  The OIA shall follow the \nrecommendations of the IE.    \nC.  Policy and Training.  The OIA and IE shall develop the policies and \ntraining materials necessary for member schools to effectively and \naccurately complete the assessment form submitted to the OIA.  \nD.  Student-Interest Assessment and Addition of Participation \nOpportunities.   \n1.  The OIA shall regularly assess and take affirmative steps to develop \ngirls’ interest in and ability to participate in athletics in greater \nnumbers. \n{00661995.DOCX}B-1 \nADDITIONAL OIA SPECIFIC TERMS \nA.B. v.

The IE shall develop a student interest survey that will be \nadministered and distributed by the OIA to its member schools, \nperiodically as determined by the IE. \n3.  The OIA and the IE shall determine sports and additional levels of \ncompetition for which there is or may be unmet interest among girls.  \n4.  If there is sufficient interest and demand for additional girls’ sports, \nthe OIA shall take appropriate action to introduce and initiate a new \nsport and/or levels of competition to meet such interest. \n5.  To encourage other schools and/or leagues within the Hawaii High \nSchool Athletic Association (“HHSAA”) to sponsor additional girls’ \nsports, the OIA and its representatives will act in good faith and \nexercise best efforts to advocate, propose and recommend additional \ngirls’ sports and teams to the HHSAA, including, but not limited to, at \nall HHSAA meetings. \n6.  In the event that the HHSAA is unable to sponsor an additional girls’ \nsport or schedule an additional team for a full league schedule, the \nOIA shall schedule a reasonable number of opportunities for them to \ncompete, including scheduling additional non-league competition to \nmake up for the lack of league contests and continue to develop the \nsport into a full league schedule.  \nE.  Treatment and Benefits.  \n1.  To the extent that the OIA provides, funds, or impacts the treatment \nand benefits at the member schools, the OIA shall ensure that it does \nso in a gender-equitable way consistent with Title IX. \n2.  Scheduling of Games & Practice Times \na)  The OIA shall maintain and publish all competition schedules \non the OIA website.  \n3.

HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nSUMMARY* \n \n \nTitle IX / Class Certification \n \n  The panel reversed the district court’s order denying \nfemale student athletes’ motion for class certification in their \naction seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to redress \nalleged violations of Title IX in the athletic programs at a \npublic high school in Hawaii. \n \n  Plaintiffs brought Title IX claims for failure to provide \nequal treatment and benefits, failure to provide male and \nfemale  students  with  equivalent  opportunities  for \nparticipation  in  athletics,  and  retaliation  against  female \nathletes when issues of Title IX compliance were brought to \nthe attention of high school administrators.  The district court \ndenied  plaintiffs’  motion  for  class  certification  on  the \ngrounds that, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), they failed to meet \nthe requirement of  numerosity, and  as to the retaliation \nclaim, commonality and typicality were lacking.  The district \ncourt concluded that because plaintiffs failed to meet one or \nmore requirements of Rule 23(a), it was not necessary to \naddress the additional requirements of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) and \n(b)(2). \n \n  As  to  numerosity,  the  panel  held  that  Rule  23(a)(1) \nrequires a party seeking class certification to show that “the \nclass  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.”  The panel applied the standard set forth in \nJordan v. County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. \n1982), vacated, 459 U.S. 810 (1982), on remand, 713 F.2d \n \n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It \nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\n(3 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 3 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  3 \n \n503 (9th Cir. 1983), modified, 726 F.2d 1366 (9th Cir. 1984), \nwhich requires consideration of the size of the class as well \nas  potentially  countervailing  factors  including  the \ngeographical  diversity  of  class  members,  the  ability  of \nindividual  claimants  to  institute  separate  suits,  whether \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is sought, and the ability to \nidentify and locate class members.  The panel concluded that \nthe district court failed to give appropriate weight to the very \nlarge size of the proposed class, which well exceeded 300 \npersons,  and  there  were  no  countervailing  case-specific \nconsiderations indicating that, despite the large class size, \njoinder of all class members was nonetheless practicable.  \nThe panel held that the district court also erred in failing \nadequately to consider the fact that the class, as defined, \nincluded “future” female student athletes at the high school.  \nThe panel therefore reversed the denial of class certification \nas to plaintiffs’ first and second claims and remanded with \ninstructions to address whether plaintiffs also satisfied one \nor more of the criteria in Rule 23(b). \n \n  The panel held that as to plaintiffs’ third cause of action \nfor  unlawful  retaliation,  the  district  court  erred  in  also \ndenying  class  certification  on  the  further  ground  that \nplaintiffs failed to show commonality and typicality because \nthis claim was centered on the high school water polo team, \nrather than on female student athletes as a whole.  The panel \nconcluded that the district court failed adequately to consider \nplaintiffs’  contention  that  defendants’  alleged  retaliatory \nactions had a classwide effect.  In addition, the district court \nfailed to properly consider the legal principles that govern a \nretaliation claim of this nature under Title IX and require \nconsideration of whether plaintiffs fall within the zone of \ninterests that Title IX protects. \n \n\n(4 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 4 of 27\n4  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \n  The panel held that the district court abused its discretion \nin concluding that plaintiffs did not meet the requirements of \nRule 23(a).

B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  5 \n \nOPINION \nCOLLINS, Circuit Judge: \nSection 901(a) of Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 provides that, subject to certain exceptions, “[n]o \nperson in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any education program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a).  Although Title IX contains no express language \ncreating a private cause of action, the Supreme Court has \nlong held that the statute is enforceable through a judicially \nrecognized implied private right of action.  See Franklin v. \nGwinnett Cnty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 65 (1992) (citing \nCannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979)).  \nInvoking that right of action here, female student athletes at \nHawaii’s largest public high school brought this putative \nclass  action  seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to \nredress multiple alleged violations of Title IX, including \nsystematic  discriminatory  deficiencies  in  their  school’s \nathletic programs.  The district court subsequently denied \nPlaintiffs’  motion  for  class  certification,  holding  that \nPlaintiffs had failed to satisfy the requirements of Federal \nRule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a).    We  authorized  this \ninterlocutory appeal under Rule 23(f), and we reverse. \nI \nA \nPlaintiffs A.B., her younger sister A.M.B., T.T., and A.P. \nare or were female student athletes at James Campbell High \n\n(6 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 6 of 27\n6  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nSchool (“Campbell”) in Ewa Beach on the island of Oahu.1  \nAt the time A.B. and T.T. moved for class certification in \nMay 2019, all four were members of the Campbell girls’ \nvarsity water polo team; A.B. and T.T. were also members \nof the girls’ varsity swimming team; and A.P. was also a \nmember of the girls’ varsity soccer team.2  A.M.B. later \nstated that she also planned to join the swimming team.  \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  they  and  other  female  students  at \nCampbell “experience grossly unequal treatment, benefits, \nand opportunities in relation to male athletes,” resulting in \nmultiple violations of Title IX.  As a result, A.B. and T.T. \nfiled this suit in December 2018 against Defendant Hawaii \nState Department of Education (“the Department”), which is \nthe  agency  that  manages  Campbell’s  operations,  and \nDefendant Oahu Interscholastic Association, which is an \nunincorporated entity that administers high school athletic \nprograms for public high schools on Oahu.  In the operative \nsecond amended complaint, Plaintiffs assert three separate \ncauses  of  action  available  under  Title  IX  and  its \nimplementing  regulations:  “(1) unequal  treatment  and \nbenefits  in  athletic  programs;  (2) unequal  participation \nopportunities in athletic programs; and (3) retaliation.”  See \n \n1 A.B. and T.T. were seniors at the time this case was originally filed \nin late 2018 and graduated before the district court ruled on the class \ncertification motion.  A.P. was a senior at the time this case was argued \nand has presumably graduated.  A.M.B. was a junior at the time of oral \nargument and is presumably a current senior.  No party has suggested \nthat this case is moot, and we perceive no basis for concluding that it is. \n2 After the class certification motion was filed, but before the district \ncourt denied it, amended complaints were filed adding A.M.B. and A.P. \nas additional plaintiffs.  All four Plaintiffs submitted declarations in \nsupport of the class certification motion. \n\n(7 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 7 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  7 \n \nOllier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 768 F.3d 843, \n851 (9th Cir. 2014). \nIn  their  first  cause  of  action,  Plaintiffs  allege  that \nDefendants violated § 901(a) by failing to provide equal \ntreatment  and  benefits.    We  have  held  that  § 901(a)’s \nprohibition on discriminatory denial of educational benefits, \nas  construed  in  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education’s \nimplementing  regulation  governing  school  athletic \nprograms, “require[s] equivalence in the availability, quality \nand kinds of . . . athletic benefits and opportunities provided \n[to] male and female athletes.”  Mansourian v. Regents of \nUniv. of Cal., 602 F.3d 957, 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (citing 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)–\n(10));  see  also  20  U.S.C.  § 1682  (authorizing  federal \nagencies  extending  federal  financial  assistance  to  issue \nappropriate  “rules,  regulations,  or  orders  of  general \napplicability”).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated \nthis  requirement  by  “failing  to  provide  female  student \nathletes from Campbell with treatment and benefits that are \ncomparable to the treatment and benefits provided to male \nstudent athletes.” \nIn support of this claim, Plaintiffs allege, for example, \nthat “male athletes at Campbell have exclusive access” to a \nvery large “stand-alone athletic locker room facility that is \nlocated near the athletic fields,” while “female athletes at \nCampbell have no standalone athletic locker room facility, \nwhether located near the athletic fields or elsewhere on \ncampus.”  Plaintiffs allege that, as a result, “female athletes, \nincluding Plaintiffs, must carry their athletic gear around \nwith them all day and have resorted to changing in teachers’ \nclosets, in the bathroom of the nearest Burger King, and even \non the practice field, potentially in full view of bystanders.”  \nPlaintiffs also allege that, in contrast to Campbell’s well-\n\n(8 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 8 of 27\n8  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nequipped boys’ sports programs, the girls’ water polo and \nsoccer programs have not been given adequate equipment, \ngear, and training facilities.  Indeed, the complaint alleges \nthat on multiple occasions, the girls’ water polo team lacked \nany access to a pool for practice, leaving them “no choice \nbut to hold dry-land training sessions and open-ocean swim \npractices.”  Plaintiffs also allege that coaches for the girls’ \nteams at Campbell are generally paid less than coaches for \nthe boys’ teams, and that some assistant coaches for the \ngirls’ teams are not paid at all. \nPlaintiffs’ second cause of action alleges that Defendants \nviolated § 901(a) by failing to provide male and female \nstudents with equivalent opportunities for “participation” in \nathletics.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Relying again on the \nregulations implementing § 901(a)’s requirements, we have \nheld that this obligation to provide equivalent participation \nopportunities  requires  consideration  of  “whether  ‘the \nselection  of  sports  and  levels  of  competition  effectively \naccommodate the interests and abilities of members of both \nsexes.’”  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 964 (quoting 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.41(c)(1)).  In addressing that question, our precedent \napplies a “three-part test,” under which a school has “three \noptions”  for  satisfying  this  obligation:  “(1) showing \nsubstantial  proportionality  (the  number  of  women  in \n[interscholastic]  athletics  is  proportionate  to  their \nenrollment); (2) proving that the institution has a ‘history \nand  continuing  practice  of  program  expansion’  for  the \nunderrepresented sex (in this case, women); or (3) where the \n[school]  cannot  satisfy  either  of  the  first  two  options, \nestablishing  that  it  nonetheless  ‘fully  and  effectively \naccommodate[s]’  the  interests  of  women.”    Id.  at  965 \n(citation omitted); see also Ollier, 768 F.3d at 855 (applying \nthis three-part test to high schools).

HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  9 \n \nCampbell fails to satisfy any of these alternative prongs.  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs allege that there is 6.6% “participation \ngap” at Campbell between “female athletic participation” \n(which  is  41.6%  of  the  total  number  of  athletic  “roster \nspots”) and “female student body enrollment” (which is \n48.2% of the student body). \nPlaintiffs’ third cause of action is asserted only against \nthe  Department  and  alleges  that  it  violated  § 901(a)  by \nretaliating against female athletes at Campbell when A.B., \nT.T., and others brought issues of Title IX compliance to the \nattention  of  Campbell  administrators.    See  Jackson  v. \nBirmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 178 (2005) (holding \nthat “the text of Title IX prohibits a funding recipient from \nretaliating  against  a  person  who  speaks  out  against  sex \ndiscrimination,  because  such  retaliation  is  intentional \n‘discrimination’  ‘on  the  basis  of  sex’”).    Specifically, \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  school  administrators  retaliated  by \nthreatening to cancel Campbell’s girls’ water polo program \nand by making the water polo team needlessly resubmit \nprogram  paperwork.    Plaintiffs  further  allege  that  these \nretaliatory  actions  created  a  “chilling  effect  among \nCampbell’s  female  athletes  regarding  identifying  and \ncomplaining about other gender inequities in athletics” to the \nDepartment. \nPlaintiffs’  complaint  seeks  only  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief against Defendants, as well as attorneys’ \nfees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nB \nRelying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B) \nand (b)(2), Plaintiffs moved to certify a class of “all present \nand future Campbell female students and potential students \nwho  participate,  seek  to  participate,  and/or  are  or  were \n\n(10 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 10 of 27\n10  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \ndeterred from participating in athletics at Campbell.”  After \nconsidering the evidence and arguments of both sides, the \ndistrict court denied the motion. \nThe  district  court  held  that,  as  to  all  three  claims, \nPlaintiffs had failed to make the required threshold showing \nthat the class was “so numerous that joinder of all members \nis impracticable.”  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).  The court \nnoted that the evidence supplied by Defendants indicated \nthat “there were 366 Campbell female student-athletes in the \n2018–19 school year.”  Nonetheless, because the “proposed \nclass members are limited to the female student population \nfrom a single high school” and are thus “geographically tied \nto one area of Hawai`i, and identifiable through school and \nathletic records,” the court concluded that joinder of all class \nmembers was not impracticable.  Although school records \ncould not similarly identify future or potential female student \nathletes  at  Campbell,  the  district  court  held  that  those \n“subgroups”  were  irrelevant  to  the  numerosity  analysis \nbecause neither was “reasonably identifiable.” \nTurning to the other elements of Rule 23(a), the district \ncourt held that Plaintiffs’ first and second causes of action—\nwhich  alleged  denial  of  equal  treatment  and  equal \nparticipation  opportunities—raised  several  common \nquestions of law or fact that were “capable of classwide \nresolution,” see Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 350 (2011) (construing FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(2)), and \nthat the individual Plaintiffs’ claims under these two causes \nof  action  were  “typical”  of  the  claims  of  the  class.  \nSpecifically,  Plaintiffs  alleged  a  number  of  discrete \ndiscriminatory actions with inherently systemic effects on \nfemale student athletes, and the resulting “[u]nequal access, \ntreatment, and benefits of athletic programs is a common \ninjury among the named Plaintiffs and proposed class.” \n\n(11 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 11 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  11 \n \nBy contrast, the district court held that commonality and \ntypicality were lacking with respect to Plaintiffs’ third cause \nof  action,  which  alleges  retaliation.    Commonality  was \nabsent, the court concluded, because the retaliation claim \narose from a dispute between “Campbell administrators[] \nand the water polo team and their parents,” and Plaintiffs had \nnot  “allege[d]  any  instances  of  retaliation  against  any \nathletes other than members of the water polo team.”  For \nsimilar reasons, the district court concluded that the alleged \nretaliatory actions of the Department were “unique to the \nnamed Plaintiffs” and were therefore “not typical of the \nproposed class.” \nLastly, the district court found that Plaintiffs would be \nadequate representatives of the class, without distinguishing \namong the three claims. \nHaving concluded that Plaintiffs had failed to satisfy one \nor more requirements of Rule 23(a), the court stated that it \nwas “not necessary to address” the additional requirements \nof Rule 23(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2). \nPlaintiffs timely petitioned for leave to appeal pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), and a panel of this \ncourt granted Plaintiffs’ petition.  This court has jurisdiction \nover Plaintiffs’ appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(e). \nII \nTo obtain certification of a plaintiff class under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23, a plaintiff must satisfy both the \nfour  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)—“numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation”—and \n“one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).”  Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 345, 349.  These are not “mere pleading” \nrequirements,  and  a  plaintiff  must  “affirmatively \n\n(12 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 12 of 27\n12  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \ndemonstrate . . . compliance with the Rule—that is, he [or \nshe]  must  be  prepared  to  prove  that  there  are  in  fact \nsufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or \nfact, etc.”  Id. at 350.  Here, the district court never reached \nthe issue of whether Plaintiffs had shown one of the elements \nof Rule 23(b),3 because it concluded that (1) Rule 23(a)’s \nrequired  threshold  showing  of  numerosity  had  not  been \nmade as to any of Plaintiffs’ claims; and (2) Rule 23(a)’s \nrequirements of commonality and typicality had not been \nshown as to Plaintiffs’ retaliation claim.  We review these \ndeterminations for abuse of discretion, keeping in mind that \na “district court abuses its discretion where it commits an \nerror of law, relies on an improper factor, omits a substantial \nfactor, or engages in a clear error of judgment in weighing \nthe correct mix of factors.”  Senne v. Kansas City Royals \nBaseball Corp., 934 F.3d 918, 926 (9th Cir. 2019).  Applying \nthose standards, we reverse. \nIII \nA \nRule 23(a)(1) requires a party seeking class certification \nto show that “the class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).  As \nthe  Supreme  Court  has  explained,  this  “numerosity \n \n3 In moving for class certification, Plaintiffs argued that the requisite \nelement of Rule 23(b) was satisfied either (1) because Defendants had \n“acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole,” see FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2); \nor (2) because separate actions by individual class members could, “as a \npractical matter, . . . be dispositive of the interests of the other members” \nor could “substantially impair or impede [the other members’] ability to \nprotect their interests,” see FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(1)(B). \n\n(13 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 13 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  13 \n \nrequirement requires examination of the specific facts of \neach case and imposes no absolute limitations.”  General \nTel. Co. of the NW., Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).  \nWhile thus eschewing any bright-line rules, the Court did go \non to state that a class with only 15 members “would be too \nsmall to meet the numerosity requirement.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs contend that we should apply the standards for \nevaluating numerosity set forth in Jordan v. County of Los \nAngeles, 669 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated, 459 U.S. \n810  (1982),  on  remand,  713  F.2d  503  (9th  Cir.  1983), \nmodified,  726  F.2d  1366  (9th  Cir.  1984).    Defendants, \nhowever, contend that Jordan is no longer good law and in \nany  event  is  distinguishable.    Because  the  parties  have \npointed us to no other decision in which we have elaborated \non the substantive standards for evaluating numerosity—and \nour own research has likewise revealed none—we begin by \nclosely examining our decisions in Jordan. \nIn that case, the plaintiff’s class action complaint alleged \nthat the defendant county’s consideration of “three types of \ncriminal  record,  i.e.,  juvenile  record,  arrest  record,  and \nmarijuana  conviction  record”  constituted  unlawful  race \ndiscrimination against Blacks in violation of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., as well \nas a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1981.  See 669 F.2d at 1314–15.  The district court denied \nplaintiff’s motion to certify separate classes as to each type \nof criminal record, concluding that all four requirements of \nRule 23(a), including numerosity, had not been satisfied.  Id. \nat 1318–23.  We initially reversed, holding that all four \nrequirements had been met.  Id. \nIn addressing numerosity, Jordan indicated that a court \nmust consider what the evidence shows concerning “the \nabsolute number of class members.”  669 F.2d at 1319.  \n\n(14 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 14 of 27\n14  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nAlthough the size of the class “is not the sole determining \nfactor,” we stated that, “where a class is large in numbers, \njoinder will usually be impracticable.”  Id.  By contrast, \nwhere the size of the class is more modest, “the number of \nclass members does not weigh as heavily” in the analysis, \nand  “other  factors”  bearing  upon  the  feasibility  and \nconvenience of joinder may assume more significance.  Id.  \nThese  potentially  countervailing  factors  include  “the \ngeographical  diversity  of  class  members,  the  ability  of \nindividual claimants to institute separate suits, and whether \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is sought,” as well as the \nability to identify and locate class members.  Id. at 1319–20. \nApplying these standards, we held that, “[a]lthough we \nwould be inclined to find the numerosity requirement in the \npresent case satisfied solely on the basis of the number of \nascertained class members, i.e., 39, 64, and 71, we need not \ndo so since the presence of other indicia of impracticability \npersuade us that the requirement has been met.”  Id. at 1319.  \nSpecifically, we noted that “the relatively small size of each \nclass  member’s  claim  and  the  probability  that  the  class \nmembers may be difficult to locate combine to make it \nimpracticable for individual class members to join in the \nlawsuit.”  Id. at 1319–20.  We also observed that each class \nincluded “unnamed and unknown future black applicants” \nand that the “joinder of unknown individuals is inherently \nimpracticable.”  Id. at 1320.  Based on these reasons, we held \nthat “the district court erred in denying class certification for \nfailure to satisfy the numerosity requirement.”  Id. \nWe then proceeded to find that the plaintiff had also \nsatisfied  the  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a).  Id. at 1320–23.  However, our \nanalysis of the commonality and typicality factors expressly \nrelied on the Fifth Circuit’s so-called “across-the-board” \n\n(15 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 15 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  15 \n \nrule, under which a plaintiff challenging one discriminatory \npractice was permitted to represent employees challenging \ndifferent practices if all employees suffered similar injuries.  \nId. at 1320, 1322 (citing Johnson v. Georgia Hwy. Express, \n417 F.2d 1122, 1124 (5th Cir. 1969)).  Shortly thereafter, the \nSupreme  Court  explicitly  rejected  that  “across-the-board \nrule,” concluding that it improperly relied on a presumption \nthat  a  discriminatory  employment  decision  against  the \nnamed plaintiff reflects a pervasive discriminatory policy \nthat is then reflected in all of the defendant’s various hiring \npractices.    See  General  Tel.  Co.  of  the  SW.  v.  Falcon, \n457 U.S.  147,  157–58  (1982).    The  Court  consequently \nvacated our decision in Jordan for reconsideration in light of \nFalcon.  See Jordan, 459 U.S. at 810. \nOn remand, we concluded that, in light of the Supreme \nCourt’s intervening abrogation of the across-the-board rule, \nas  well  as  our  “recomputation  of  the  actual  number  of \nrejected black applicants,” the “numerosity requirement of \nRule 23” had not been met.  See Jordan, 726 F.2d at 1367 \n(emphasis added), amending 713 F.2d at 504.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, however, we did not in any way suggest that \nour  original  decision’s  substantive  articulation  of  the \nnumerosity standards was erroneous.  Moreover, Falcon \ndoes not address the standards for numerosity at all, and it \ntherefore  provides  no  basis  for  declining  to  follow  our \nelaboration  of  the  numerosity  requirement  in  our  initial \ndecision in Jordan.  See Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, \n899–900 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc).  Accordingly, we will \napply Jordan’s framework in assessing numerosity here. \nB \nWe conclude that the district court’s numerosity analysis \nwas inconsistent with Jordan in two respects. \n\n(16 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 16 of 27\n16  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \n1 \nFirst, the district court failed to give appropriate weight \nto  the  very  large  size  of  the  proposed  class.    Plaintiffs \npresented uncontroverted evidence that in the 2016–2017, \n2017–2018, and 2018–2019 school years, the annual number \nof female student athletes at Campbell ranged between 366 \nand 434.  Thus, even considering only currently enrolled \nstudents,  the  evidence  amply  shows  that  a  reasonable \nestimate of the size of the class well exceeds 300 persons. \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to make any \nshowing that all current female student athletes have been \nsubjected to the alleged Title IX violations and are therefore \nclass members, but we think this argument overlooks both \nthe  substance  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  and  the  applicable \nstandards for liability under Title IX.  Some aspects of \nPlaintiffs’  first  cause  of  action,  which  alleges  unequal \ntreatment  and  benefits,  explicitly  rest  on  allegations  of \nsystemic discrimination (such as, for example, the complete \nlack of standalone athletic locker facilities) that, if proved, \nwould  necessarily  apply  to  all  current  female  student \nathletes.  See supra at 7–8.  As to the second cause of action \nfor unequal participation opportunities, the three-part test we \napply for evaluating such claims is framed in terms that \nexamine the school’s overall treatment of female athletic \nprograms versus male athletic programs.  See supra at 8.  \nAnd for reasons we explain further below, we conclude that \nPlaintiffs’  third  cause  of  action  for  retaliation  likewise \nproperly rests upon asserted classwide adverse impacts on \nfemale student athletes at Campbell.  See infra at 24–26.  It \nfollows  that  Plaintiffs  amply  showed  that  the  absolute \nnumber of class members as to each claim is well over 300 \npersons.    The  resulting  class  size  qualifies  as  “large  in \nnumbers” by any metric, and therefore, under Jordan, that \n\n(17 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 17 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  17 \n \nlarge class size weighs in favor of concluding that joinder of \nall of these persons is impracticable.  669 F.2d at 1319. \nOn this record, we find no countervailing case-specific \nconsiderations indicating that, despite the large class size, \njoinder of all class members is nonetheless practicable.  In \nconcluding that joinder of all class members was practicable \nhere, despite the potential size of the class, the district court \nemphasized that all of Campbell’s current female student \nathletes could be identified “through school and athletic \nrecords” and that all of them were local and within the \njurisdiction of the court.  But the standard under Rule 23(a) \nis not, as the district court seemed to think, whether joinder \nis a literal impossibility.  Rather, the question is whether \njoinder  of  all  class  members  is  “practicable”—i.e., \n“reasonably  capable  of  being  accomplished.”    See \nPracticable, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (11th  ed.  2019) \n(emphasis added); see also Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine \nEsts.,  Inc.,  329  F.2d  909,  913–14  (9th  Cir.  1964) \n(“‘[I]mpracticability’  does  not  mean  ‘impossibility,’  but \nonly the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members \nof the class.”); Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d \nCir. 1993) (“Impracticable does not mean impossible.”). \nHere, joinder of all class members is not “reasonably \ncapable of being accomplished” because it would impose \nvery substantial logistical burdens for little, if any, benefit.  \nWhere, as here, the class seeks only prospective injunctive \nand declaratory relief, the practical value of joining each of \nthe 300+ class members as a formal party is slim to non-\nexistent  and  is  plainly  outweighed  by  the  substantial \nlogistical burdens that would entail.  See Jordan, 669 F.2d \nat 1319 (noting that “whether injunctive or declaratory relief \nis sought” is relevant to assessing whether joinder of class \nmembers is impracticable); see also Harris, 329 F.2d at 913 \n\n(18 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 18 of 27\n18  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \n(stating that, in assessing impracticability, the court should \nconsider “the expense and burden[] to the parties and the \ncourt”). \n2 \nSecond,  the  district  court  also  failed  adequately  to \nconsider the fact that the class, as defined, included “future” \nCampbell female student athletes. \n“The inclusion of future class members in a class is not \nitself unusual or objectionable,” because “[w]hen the future \npersons  referenced  become  members  of  the  class,  their \nclaims  will  necessarily  be  ripe.”    Rodriguez  v.  Hayes, \n591 F.3d 1105, 1118 (9th Cir. 2010).  We have recognized \nthat when, as here, a class’s membership changes continually \nover time, that factor weighs in favor of concluding that \njoinder  of  all  members  is  impracticable.    See  Jordan, \n669 F.2d at 13204; see also J.D. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 1291, 1322 \n \n4 Plaintiffs construe Jordan as standing for the broader proposition \nthat any proposed class that includes future members automatically \nsatisfies  the  numerosity  requirement,  because  future  members  are \ninherently unidentifiable at the time of class certification and thereby \ncannot practicably be joined.  We do not read Jordan as establishing such \na sweeping proposition.  As an initial matter, Jordan’s assumption that \nthe plaintiff in that case could represent all “future” class members \nappears to have rested in part on its application of the Fifth Circuit’s \n“across-the-board” rule.  See 669 F.2d at 1320 (citing Jack v. American \nLinen Supply Co., 498 F.2d 122 (5th Cir. 1974)).  That aspect of the \ndecision therefore did not survive Falcon, which would also explain why \nwe did not mention future class members in our decision on remand in \nJordan.  See 713 F.2d at 504, as amended, 726 F.2d at 1366–67.  \nMoreover, as we explicitly recognized in Rodriguez, the inclusion of \nfuture class members in a class definition is subject to the ripeness \nrequirement of Article III, see 591 F.3d at 1118, and so the relevant \nnumerosity inquiry concerning future class members is whether it would \nbe practicable to join such future members as their claims become ripe. \n\n(19 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 19 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  19 \n \n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (noting that this factor weighs in favor of \nimpracticability of joinder even if current class members are \nrelatively fewer in number); cf. Smith v. Swormstedt, 57 U.S. \n288, 303 (1854) (indicating, in a pre-Rules equitable suit \nbrought by members and preachers of one branch of a church \nagainst those in the other branch, that joinder of all members \nwould  be  impracticable  due  to  the  large  and  changing \nmembership of the churches); see generally 7A CHARLES \nALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, & MARY KAY KANE, \nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1762 at 227–29 (4th \ned. 2021). \nThe district court declined to consider this factor because \nit concluded that future class members were not “reasonably \nidentifiable,”  and  the  court  therefore  could  not  make  a \n“reasonable approximation” of the number of such members.  \nThis reasoning misconstrues the significance of this factor.  \nThe fact that it may not be possible to identify future class \nmembers at the time of class certification does not mean that \nthis factor therefore drops out of the analysis and may be set \naside.  On the contrary, as we held in Jordan, the fact that \nthe membership of a class changes over time makes joinder \nof every class member all the more impracticable.  See \n669 F.2d at 1320.  This case well illustrates the point.  Every \nyear, as new freshmen matriculate into Campbell and as \nseniors graduate, the membership of potentially 25% of the \nstudent body may be expected to turn over.  Given the purely \nequitable nature of the claims, there is little if any benefit to \ncontinually joining, or potentially dismissing, large numbers \nof  additional  class  members.    That  makes  the \nimpracticability analysis all the more lopsided in favor of \nfinding numerosity. \nFor  similar  reasons,  the  district  court  abused  its \ndiscretion in concluding that a “reasonable approximation” \n\n(20 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 20 of 27\n20  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nof future class members could not be made in this case.  \nGiven the three years of data in the record concerning the \napproximate  number  of  current  class  members  for  each \nschool year from 2016–2019, it is not difficult to reasonably \nestimate the extent to which class membership might be \nexpected to change each year.  For present purposes, all that \nis needed is a sufficient estimate of the number of future \nclass members to allow the court to assess what weight to \ngive to this factor when considered together with the other \npertinent considerations.  Here, as we have explained, the \nestimate of the current membership is well over 300 persons \nand already weighs heavily in favor of finding numerosity.  \nThe fact that additional persons, totaling as many as 25% of \nthat number, would also need to be formally joined each year \ntips the balance even more strongly in favor of concluding \nthat the “class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.”  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).5 \nC \nWe therefore conclude that the district court erred in \nholding  that  Plaintiffs  had  not  satisfied  the  numerosity \nrequirement of Rule 23(a).  And because that was the sole \nground on which the court concluded that the requirements \nof Rule 23(a) had not been met as to Plaintiffs’ first and \nsecond  causes  of  action,  we  reverse  the  denial  of  class \ncertification as to those claims and remand with instructions \nto address whether Plaintiffs also satisfied one or more of the \ncriteria in Rule 23(b). \n \n5 In view of this analysis, we find it unnecessary to address the \nparties’ arguments as to whether numerosity is further established by the \npresence, in the class definition, of female student non-athletes who were \ndeterred from participation in sports by Defendants’ alleged Title IX \nviolations. \n\n(21 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 21 of 27\n  A.

HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  21 \n \nIV \nAs  to  Plaintiffs’  third  cause  of  action  for  unlawful \nretaliation, the district court also denied class certification on \nthe  further  ground  that  Plaintiffs  had  failed  to  show \ncommonality  and  typicality.    This  conclusion  was  also \nflawed. \nThe commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) requires \nplaintiffs seeking class certification to show that their claims \n“depend upon a common contention” that “is capable of \nclasswide resolution—which means that determination of its \ntruth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, \n564 U.S. at 350.  To establish typicality, as required by Rule \n23(a)(3), plaintiffs must show that “the claims or defenses of \nthe  representative  parties  are  typical  of  the  claims  or \ndefenses of the class.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(3).  “The test of \ntypicality  ‘is  whether  other  members  have  the  same  or \nsimilar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which \nis not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class \nmembers have been injured by the same course of conduct.’”  \nHanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. \n1992)  (citation  omitted).    Because  the  considerations \nunderlying the two requirements overlap considerably, the \nSupreme  Court  has  noted  that  “[t]he  commonality  and \ntypicality  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)  tend  to  merge.”  \nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 157 n.13. \nThe district court concluded that these two requirements \nwere  not  satisfied  here,  because  in  its  view  Plaintiffs’ \nretaliation claim is centered on the water polo team rather \nthan on female student athletes as a whole.  As the district \ncourt explained, the Department’s retaliatory actions arose \nfrom “a dispute between Defendants, specifically limited to \nCampbell administrators, and the water polo team and their \n\n(22 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 22 of 27\n22  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nparents,” and the only claimed instances of actual retaliation \nwere  against  “members  of  the  water  polo  team.”    This \nreasoning misapprehends Plaintiffs’ retaliation claim and the \nlaw governing it. \nAlthough the Department’s alleged retaliatory actions \nwere immediately directed at the water polo team, whose \nmembers  and  their  parents  had  made  complaints  about \nunequal treatment, the district court failed adequately to \nconsider  Plaintiffs’  contention  that  those  actions  had  a \nclasswide  effect.    Specifically,  Plaintiffs  assert  that  the \nexample that the Department made of the girls’ water polo \nteam had the effect of broadly dissuading Campbell’s female \nstudent  athletes  from  “raising  the  issue  of  sex \ndiscrimination”  out  of  fear  that  the  Department  would \nlikewise  retaliate  against  them.    Indeed,  a  declaration \nsubmitted  by  one  of  the  Plaintiffs’  parents  specifically \naverred  that  other  students  and  parents  had  “expressed \ninterest in joining the lawsuit, but were scared about the \nrepercussions from [the Department] if they did so.”  This \nparent explained that, for example, one student who was a \n“star athlete” and who hoped to win college scholarships, \nwas  too  afraid  “to  jeopardize  her  relationship  with  the \nschool.” \nIn addition to overlooking the broader theory of unlawful \nretaliation that Plaintiffs raised here, the district court failed \nto  properly  consider  the  legal  principles  that  govern  a \nretaliation claim of this nature under Title IX.  On this point, \nwe find our prior decision in Ollier to be instructive, and so \nwe address that decision in some detail. \nIn  Ollier,  complaints  concerning  a  high  school’s \ncompliance with Title IX were made by the named plaintiffs’ \nparents  and  the  girls’  softball  coach,  Chris  Martinez.  \n768 F.3d at 853, 866–67.  In response, the school fired \n\n(23 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 23 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  23 \n \nCoach  Martinez  and  replaced  him  with  a  “far  less \nexperienced coach,” eliminated the girls’ softball team’s \nassistant coaches, and took a variety of other actions that \n“disrupted” the girls’ softball program.  Id. at 869.  On \nappeal,  the  defendants  made  a  series  of  arguments  that \nresemble those made by the Department here.  Specifically, \nthe  Ollier  defendants  argued  that  the  named  plaintiffs \n“lack[ed] standing to enjoin the retaliatory action allegedly \ntaken  against  Coach  Martinez”;  that  they  also  “lack[ed] \nstanding because it was not they who made the Title IX \ncomplaints”;  and  that  classwide  relief  was  unwarranted \nbecause “only some members of the plaintiff[s’] class . . . \ncan urge they engaged in protected activity.”  Id. at 865–66, \n868.  We rejected all of these contentions, concluding that \nthey rested on too restrictive a view of Title IX’s cause of \naction for retaliation.  Id. at 866–69. \nWe held that the named plaintiffs clearly asserted a \nsufficient injury-in-fact to satisfy Article III, because their \n“prospects  for  competing  were  hampered”  when  the \ndefendants “impermissibly retaliated against them by firing \nCoach Martinez.”  Id. at 865 (emphasis in original).  We also \nrecognized, however, that what the defendants characterized \nas “standing” arguments actually rested primarily on the \ngeneral prudential rule against asserting the rights of third \nparties.  Id. (citing Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 \n(1975));  cf.  Lexmark  Int’l,  Inc.  v.  Static  Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 126 (2014) (noting that “the \ngeneral prohibition on a litigant’s raising another person’s \nlegal rights” is “not derived from Article III,” but reflects \nwhat has inexactly been called the “‘prudential’ branch of \nstanding”).  Addressing the question that way, we held that \nthe named plaintiffs could assert a Title IX retaliation claim \nbased on retaliatory actions that were directed at another \nperson  (Coach  Martinez)  and  that  were  triggered  by \n\n(24 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 24 of 27\n24  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \ncomplaints made by others (Coach Martinez and various \nparents).  Ollier, 768 F.3d at 866–67. \nIn reaching that conclusion, we noted that the Supreme \nCourt had addressed a somewhat similar individual third-\nparty retaliation claim under Title VII in Thompson v. North \nAmerican Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 177–78 (2011).  See \nOllier, 768 F.3d at 866.  There, both Thompson and his \nfiancée worked in the same company, and the allegation was \nthat Thompson was fired in retaliation for complaints about \nsex discrimination made by his fiancée.  Thompson, 562 U.S. \nat 172.  The Court held that, because Thompson was within \nthe “zone of interests” protected by Title VII, he had a cause \nof action for retaliation even though his fiancée was the one \nwho had engaged in the protected activity that led to the \nretaliation.  Id. at 177–78.  We concluded in Ollier that this \nsame zone-of-interest analysis applies to Title IX, and we \ntherefore considered whether the named plaintiffs in that \ncase were “within the ‘zone of interests’ that Title IX’s \nimplicit antiretaliation provisions seek to protect.”  Ollier, \n768 F.3d at 866; see also Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 127 & n.3 \n(suggesting that, in many cases, “third-party standing” is \nreally an issue of whether the party has a cause of action \nunder a statute, which in turn depends in part on the zone-of-\ninterests test).  Because those named plaintiffs were students \nwho had suffered a diminished athletic experience due to \nretaliation, we concluded that they easily fell within Title \nIX’s zone of interests.  Ollier, 768 F.3d at 866.  They \ntherefore had a cause of action under Title IX to seek redress \nfor those injuries, despite the fact that the actual Title IX \ncomplaints that led to the retaliation were “made by their \nparents and Coach Martinez.”  Id. at 866–67. \nWe similarly held that classwide injunctive relief was \nproperly awarded in Ollier, despite the fact that many of the \n\n(25 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 25 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  25 \n \nclass members had not even been “members of the softball \nteam at the time of retaliation.”  Id. at 868.  In so holding, we \nreiterated the breadth of Title IX’s zone of interests, see id. \n(citing Thompson, 562 U.S. at 178), and asserted that we had \napproved similarly broadly-defined classes that included “all \ncurrent and future” female students, id. (citation omitted).  \nBecause the class members in Ollier had been affected by \nthe retaliation and were within the zone of interests protected \nby Title IX’s prohibition on retaliation, the district court \nproperly extended its grant of injunctive relief “so as to \nvindicate the rights of former and future students.”  Id. \nAlthough Ollier did not directly address the issue of class \ncertification, see id. at 854 n.4, it is clear that the district \ncourt’s  application  of  Rule  23(a)’s  requirements  to \nPlaintiffs’ retaliation claim in this case cannot be reconciled \nwith Ollier’s analysis of the law governing such claims.  \nHere, as in Ollier, the specific Title IX complaints that led to \nthe retaliation were made only by a particular subset of \npeople (here, particular students and parents associated with \nthe water polo team).  But the concerns those persons raised \nswept more broadly to include Campbell’s treatment of girls’ \nathletics generally, and Plaintiffs have likewise presented \nevidence that the resulting retaliation had a deterrent effect \non female students more generally.  See supra at 22.  Thus, \nunder  Ollier’s  reasoning,  those  other  putative  class \nmembers—even those not on the water polo team—would \nfall within Title IX’s zone of interests and would have a \ncause of action for equitable relief against the Department’s \nretaliatory actions.  See 768 F.3d at 866–67.  And, as in \nOllier, the fact that many of the class members were not the \ndirect targets of the alleged retaliation would not necessarily \nbe a bar to classwide relief.  Id. at 868. \n\n(26 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 26 of 27\n26  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nIt follows from these conclusions that the district court \nabused  its  discretion  in  holding  that  Plaintiffs  had  not \nestablished commonality and typicality as to their retaliation \nclaim.  Given that the retaliation claims of both the named \nPlaintiffs  and  the  class  members  would  rest  on  the \nunderlying  motivation  for  the  Department’s  alleged \nretaliatory  actions  in  response  to  receiving  Title  IX \ncomplaints, that issue of retaliatory motive raises a common \nquestion whose answer will “resolve an issue that is central \nto the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 350.  That is sufficient to satisfy Rule \n23(a)(2). \nFor similar reasons, the district court erred in concluding, \nin effect, that the direct victims of unlawful retaliation have \nclaims that are atypical of the claims of the indirect victims.  \nPlaintiffs’ retaliation claim is not premised solely on the \ninjury of threatening to cancel Campbell’s girls’ water polo \nprogram and make the water polo team needlessly resubmit \nprogram paperwork.  Instead, it is also premised on the \n“chilling effect” felt by female athletes throughout the high \nschool.  And where, as claimed here, the persons who raised \nbroader concerns about Title IX compliance were met with \na retaliatory response that likewise impacted female student \nathletes  generally,  the  indirect  victims’  claims  depend \ncritically upon the success of the direct victims’ claims.  As \na result, there is little prospect that the named plaintiffs’ \nclaims could be said to be burdened with defenses or issues \nunique to them and distinct from the other class members.  \nSee Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508.  Plaintiffs thus established \ntypicality under Rule 23(a)(3). \n*          *          * \nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court abused its \ndiscretion  in  concluding  that  Plaintiffs  had  not  met  the \n\n(27 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 27 of 27\n  A.

(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), by and through their attorneys, \nfor this complaint, allege and aver as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This case is about ensuring that female athletes in Hawaii’s public \nschools are on a level playing field with their male athlete counterparts. Plaintiffs \nare female athletes at James Campbell High School (“Campbell”), which is run by \nthe Hawaii State Department of Education (“DOE”). They are passionate and \ndedicated athletes. Yet simply because of their gender, Plaintiffs experience \ngrossly unequal treatment, benefits, and opportunities in relation to male athletes. \n2.  As just one example of this disparity, for decades, male athletes at \nCampbell have had exclusive access to a stand-alone athletic locker room facility \nin which they can store gear, change, shower, use the bathrooms, hold team \nmeetings, and build team spirit. Female athletes have nothing comparable. As a \nresult, female athletes must lug their athletic gear around all day. Female athletes \nmust resort to changing in teachers’ closets, in the bathroom of the nearest Burger \nKing, and even on the practice field, risking potential exposure to bystanders. To \ngo to the bathroom, female athletes must run back to the campus gym (which is \nlocated roughly two football fields in length away), use decrepit porta-potties \n  1 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 4 of 68     PageID #:\n 1658\n(which are sometimes locked), or face having to crouch down in the bushes. \nPerhaps most important, female athletes must carry the burden of knowing their \neducational institution does not value them as much—that they are, in essence, \nsecond-class—just because they are female. \n3.  The DOE has perpetuated these inequities for decades across its \nschools. Since at least as early as 1978, the DOE was on notice that it had various \nunmet deficiencies relating to its Title IX compliance. The DOE said it was \nworking to close those gaps. But what followed was four decades of delay in \nproviding female athletes with treatment, benefits, and opportunities equal to those \nreceived by male athletes as required by Title IX. \n4.  Sadly, the DOE continues to illegally discriminate against female \nathletes today. When making athletics decisions, boys’ sports come first, and girls’ \nsports second. As just one example of this skewed “boys first” mindset, the DOE’s \n2016 “Master Plan for Athletic Facilities” recommended that one of its high \nschools, Kailua High School, proceed with “upgrad[ing] the baseball field to a \nplayoff condition field” before building a “girls athletic locker room”—a facility \nthat was, and to this day remains, on the DOE’s official “Wish List” of items to \n  2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 5 of 68     PageID #:\n 1659\naccomplish.2 As set forth below, the DOE’s decision-making at Campbell \ncontinuously discriminates against girls. \n5.  The Oahu Interscholastic Association (“OIA”)—which administers \npolicies and regulations governing interscholastic athletics for all Oahu-based DOE \nhigh schools, and which acts under the control of and in close coordination with \nthe DOE—also discriminates against girls in its decisions concerning \ninterscholastic athletics, including in scheduling of games, seasons, and \ntournaments, as well as in publicity and promotion, at Campbell and other Oahu-\nbased DOE high schools. \n6.  Plaintiffs seek to change this unjust and unlawful state of affairs. On \nbehalf of the present and future female student athletes at Campbell, Plaintiffs \nbring this class action against the DOE and the OIA (collectively, “Defendants”), \nwhich have unlawfully discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of Plaintiffs’ \nrights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Plaintiffs also seek \nredress against the DOE for unlawfully retaliating against Plaintiffs when they \nhave brought such discrimination to the DOE’s attention. \n                                              \n2 Sato & Associates, Inc., Statewide Athletic Plan, Master Planning and \nSchool Assessment, Job No. Q61002-12, Master Plan for Athletic Facilities, DEP’T \nOF EDUC., STATE OF HAWAII (Feb. 2016) at PDF 4-5, available at \nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4367267-HIDOE-Athletics-Master-\nPlan-and-Assessment.html.  \n  3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 6 of 68     PageID #:\n 1660\n7.  On behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs \nseek declaratory relief and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from \ncontinuing to engage in unlawful sex-based discrimination. Defendants’ \nlongstanding practice of putting female athletes of Hawaii second must end. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because \nPlaintiffs bring this action under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. and its implementing regulations. \n9.  This Court may order declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n10.  Venue is properly in the United States District Court for the District of \nHawaii pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Defendants are located in this \ndistrict, and the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n11.  Plaintiff A.B., age 17, is a twelfth-grade student at Campbell who \ncompetes on the girls’ varsity water polo and the girls’ varsity swimming teams. \nDefendants have discriminated against A.B. on the basis of her sex by denying her \nequal athletic opportunities, treatment, and benefits.  Because A.B. is a minor, she \n  4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 7 of 68     PageID #:\n 1661\nbrings this action by her next friends, her parents C.B. and D.B.

Defendant DOE is the state administrative agency that manages the \nstatewide system of public schools consisting of 15 complex areas and 292 \nschools. Among the schools that the DOE manages is Campbell, which is a four-\nyear public high school located in Ewa Beach, Oahu. Campbell, which is part of \nthe DOE’s Leeward Oahu District, is the largest public high school in Hawaii in \nterms of number of students. The DOE receives federal financial assistance and is \nsubject to the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX. \n16.  Defendant OIA is an unincorporated athletic association composed of \nall of the DOE’s secondary schools on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The OIA is an \ninstrumentality of, and is controlled by, the DOE. \n17.  The DOE is pervasively entwined in the management and control of \nthe OIA. The OIA’s Executive Director is a DOE employee, and all five regular \nmembers of the OIA’s Executive Council are principals of DOE high schools and \ntherefore also DOE employees. \n18.  The OIA also has controlling authority over many aspects of the \nDOE’s interscholastic athletic programs, including competitive facilities; \nscheduling of seasons, games, and tournaments; travel; publicity and promotion; \nand budget. The OIA indirectly receives federal financial assistance. The OIA is \nsubject to the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 9 of 68     PageID #:\n 1663\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  DOE’s Long History of Non-Compliance with Title IX \n19.  Nearly half a century ago, Congress passed Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any \nfederally funded education program or activity. Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, \n373 (June 23, 1972) (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.). The promise behind \nTitle IX was to root out sex discrimination in all aspects of education programs, \nand to protect individuals against such discriminatory practices. \n20.  In 2002, Title IX was renamed the “Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity \nin Education Act” in honor of Hawaii’s own Congresswoman Patsy Mink, the first \nwoman of color elected to Congress, and—notably for the purposes of this \nlawsuit—a co-author and champion of Title IX. \n21.  In many respects, Title IX has been successful in increasing female \nparticipation in athletics. As evidence of this success, in 1971, before Title IX was \nenacted, only about 294,000 of the nation’s high school athletes—or roughly 7.4% \nof all high school athletes—were girls. Today, that number has risen over ten times \nto over 3.4 million, meaning that about 42.8% of all high school athletes are girls.3 \n                                              \n3 National Federation of State High School Associations, 2017-18 High \nSchool Athletics Participation Survey, at 54, available at \nhttp://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/PDF/2017-\n18%20High%20School%20Athletics%20Participation%20Survey.pdf. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 10 of 68     PageID #:\n 1664\n22.  But at least within the State of Hawaii, Title IX’s promise remains \nunfulfilled. Nearly half a century after Title IX took effect, the DOE today fails to \nprovide Campbell female student athletes (and female students at other Hawaii \npublic schools) with athletic opportunities, treatment, and benefits equal to those \nprovided to its male student athletes. And as the history of the DOE’s actions—and \nparticularly its inaction—shows, the DOE’s present failures are in fact the \ncontinuation of four decades of noncompliance with Title IX. \nA. Initial Failures to Comply with Title IX: 1978 to 2000 \n23.  Since as early as 1978—which is the year by which secondary schools \nneeded to be in compliance with Title IX—the DOE has been discriminating \nagainst female athletes in violation of Title IX. \n24.  That year, a compliance officer from the federal Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”) visited Hawaii to investigate the DOE’s \ncompliance with Title IX and other federal civil rights laws. The EEOC found \nwidespread Title IX problems. Among other things, the DOE had not: trained its \ncivil rights coordinators in monitoring educational programs for compliance with \nfederal sex discrimination laws; promulgated and implemented student and \nemployee Title IX grievance procedures; disseminated information regarding Title \nIX to DOE students and staff; or monitored school athletic expenditures by sport \nand sex. Many of these deficiencies remain to this day.  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 11 of 68     PageID #:\n 1665\n25.  At the time, the DOE represented that it would remedy these Title IX \nissues. But subsequent events demonstrate that the DOE never did so. \n26.  Indeed, over fifteen years later, in 1994, State Representative Jackie \nYoung sent a letter to the DOE expressing dismay about the many gender \ninequities evident throughout DOE schools and specifically across its facilities for \npractices and games, equipment and uniforms, travel opportunities, scheduling, \ncompetitive opportunities, and budgeting. \n27.  After another five years of girls continuing to be denied access to \nequality in sports, and fed up with the lack of progress, both the Hawaii state \nlegislature and the Governor acted to address the DOE’s failures in monitoring and \nenforcing gender equality in athletics. \n28.  The Hawaii state legislature was first to act, passing a bill in 1999 that \nwould have “[p]rohibit[ed] discrimination in athletics on the basis of sex in any \npublic school” and “require[d] the [DOE] superintendent . . . to develop a strategic \nplan to ensure equity in sports participation.”4 This legislative action was stopped \nby the Governor, who vetoed the bill because the DOE had expressly assured the \nGovernor that the agency was “in total compliance” with Title IX. \n                                              \n4 Gender Equity in Sports, House Bill 532 (1999), \nhttps://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session1999/status/HB532_his_.htm. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 12 of 68     PageID #:\n 1666\n29.  The DOE’s representations were false. In fact, in school year 1999-\n2000, there were still vast Title IX non-compliance issues. For example, thirty-nine \nschools had boys’ athletic locker rooms while only twenty-three had girls’ athletic \nlocker rooms—that is, at least sixteen DOE schools provided locker room facilities \nin an inequitable manner, and in violation of Title IX. \n30.  Upon discovering that the DOE was not in compliance with Title IX, \nthen-governor Cayetano responded with executive action. He demanded that the \nDOE commit to a timeline for coming into compliance, articulate precisely what its \nshort- and long-term compliance plans were, and start mandatory compliance \nreviews at every public high school coupled with quarterly and annual reporting. \n31.  Shortly thereafter, in 2000, the legislature affirmed that a state law \nwas necessary to ensure that girls realize their right to equal athletic treatment and \nopportunities in Hawaii’s public high schools and passed a law requiring gender \nequity in athletics (the “Gender Equity in Athletics Law”).5 \nB. Continued Failure to Comply After Hawaii’s Executive and Legislative \nBranches Mandated Gender Equity in Athletics: 2000 to 2003 \n \n32.  The Gender Equity in Athletics Law’s mandate was clear: “No \nperson, on the basis of sex, shall be excluded from participating in, be denied the \n                                              \n5 Gender Equity in Sports, Senate Bill 2475 (2000), \nhttps://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2000/acts/Act229_SB2475_CD1_.htm \n(codified at Haw. Rev. Stat. § 302A-461). \n  10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 13 of 68     PageID #:\n 1667\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in athletics offered by a public high \nschool, pursuant to Public Law 92-318, Title IX of the federal Education \nAmendments of 1972.” \n33.  The Gender Equity in Athletics Law also created an advisory \ncommission on gender equity in sports (“Advisory Commission”) to support the \nDOE in complying with Title IX’s requirements. The Advisory Commission’s \nresponsibilities included determining whether the DOE’s schools were coming into \ncompliance with Title IX, and making recommendations to the DOE and the state \nlegislature. \n34.  For three years, from 2000 to 2003, the Advisory Commission played \na key role in exposing routine delays in the DOE’s completion of baseline \ncompliance assessments and its piecemeal or misguided approaches to resolving \ngender equity issues. \n35.  During this period, evaluations focused on athletic facilities, \nscheduling, and coaching at five DOE high schools.6 The evaluations constituted \nhundreds of pages, and produced damning results. Among the many findings of \nnoncompliance: (1) four of the five schools provided better locker rooms for boys \nthan for girls; (2) the highest quality athletic facilities were typically assigned to \nboys’ teams and not girls’ teams; (3) at one school, boys’ teams had three different \n                                              \n6 Hilo, Kahuku, Kaiser, King Kekaulike, and Roosevelt. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 14 of 68     PageID #:\n 1668\ndressing rooms available to them, whereas girls’ teams had access to a single \ndressing room; and (4) across the board, boys’ teams had far more opportunities to \nengage in pre-season competition than girls’ teams. \n36.  In 2003, the Advisory Commission issued its final report.  The report \nnoted that minimal progress had been made regarding gender equity in DOE \nschools, and highlighted several stark disparities that remained, including the need \nto build and upgrade girls’ athletic locker rooms at many high schools statewide. \n37.  The Advisory Commission’s report also found that the DOE was not \nin compliance with the U.S. Department of Education’s athletic participation \nopportunities test. Specifically, the athletic participation rate of girls in DOE \nschools was substantially disproportionate relative to student enrollment. While \ngirls constituted nearly 48% of students enrolled in DOE schools, they only made \nup 40% of athletic participants—representing a nearly 8% participation gap. This \nmeant that hundreds or thousands of girls were not getting the chance to play \ncompared to their male counterparts. \nC. Progress on Gender Equity Reverses Course: 2004 to Present \n38.  After the Advisory Commission’s work concluded, progress regarding \ngender equity in athletics has halted and, in several respects, even regressed. \n39.  For example, according to DOE self-assessments conducted in or \naround 2005, at least twelve high schools—including Campbell—identified \n  12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 15 of 68     PageID #:\n 1669\nthemselves as needing plans to reassign locker rooms from male athletes to female \nathletes because of ongoing inequalities in the allocation of athletic locker room \nfacilities.7 \n40.  Yet, according to the DOE’s 2016 “Master Plan for Athletic \nFacilities,” of the twelve high schools identified as having inequitable locker room \nfacilities, at least four (Baldwin, Campbell, Kahuku, and Waialua) still failed to \nprovide stand-alone athletic locker rooms to girls in 2016.8 That is, one third of the \nschools that the DOE had conclusively identified as needing remediation in 2005 \nstill had not yet reassigned locker rooms from boys to girls or had not yet closed \nthe gender disparity in other respects eleven years later. \n41.  According to the same “Master Plan for Athletic Facilities,” as of \n2016, ten additional schools had athletic locker rooms for boys but not for girls. \n42.  Thus, thirteen years after the Advisory Commission’s final report—\nand nearly fifty years after Title IX was passed—the disparity in athletic locker \nrooms between female athletes and male athletes remains essentially unchanged; at \n                                              \n7 The following high schools were identified as having an inequitable \ndistribution of athletic locker room facilities: Aeia, Baldwin, Campbell, Farrington, \nHilo, Kahuku, Kaimuki, Kau, Keeau, Leilehua, McKinley, Waialua, and Waianae. \n8 Upon information and belief, the same inequities persist at Baldwin, \nCampbell, Kahuku, and Waialua high schools as of this filing. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 16 of 68     PageID #:\n 1670\nleast fourteen high schools provide athletic locker rooms for their male athletes, \nbut not for their female athletes. \n43.  In addition to inequitable facilities, Title IX compliance monitoring \nand enforcement by the DOE has effectively halted. For the past few years, there is \nno public record that DOE schools have conducted compliance reviews or \nsubmitted reports about Title IX compliance. This is so in spite of the fact that the \nDOE has expressed a commitment to conduct these reviews and submit these \nreports, and otherwise comply with Title IX. \n44.  The DOE’s regression with respect to Title IX compliance is troubling \nin light of history: Title IX non-compliance in DOE schools has been the focus of \nprior litigation before this Court. In 2010, the ACLU of Hawaii filed a lawsuit in \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii on behalf of three female athletes \nat the DOE’s Baldwin High School in Wailuku, Maui, to rectify the DOE’s \ndiscriminatory treatment of the Baldwin High School girls’ softball team.9 \n45.  In granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, Judge \nDavid Alan Ezra concluded that “the evidence is very clear that the girls’ facilities \nare decidedly inferior to those of the boys’, and they have been for years.”10 Judge \n                                              \n9 Nobriga v. Dep’t of Educ., State of Hawaii, 1:10-cv-159-DAE-LK, Doc. 1 \n(D. Haw. Mar. 18, 2010). \n10 Nobriga, 1:10-cv-159-DAE-LK, Doc. 37, at 37 (D. Haw. Apr. 7, 2010). \n  14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 17 of 68     PageID #:\n 1671\nEzra emphasized that he believed “without reservation that the Department of \nEducation and the people who acted in concert . . . have not met Title IX or \nconstitutional standards, period. This isn’t even a close question.”11 Given the \nextreme disparities he had observed, Judge Ezra expressed surprise at the DOE’s \nnon-compliance: “Why somebody didn’t file a Title IX suit on this years ago is \nbeyond me . . . .”12 \n46.  Shortly after Judge Ezra’s ruling, the DOE entered into a settlement \nagreement with the plaintiffs that required the DOE to, among other things, \nimprove and expand existing girls’ softball facilities, and build a new girls’ softball \npractice field on par with the field already existing for boys.13 \n47.  Despite the 2010 Baldwin High School lawsuit, the DOE has not \nensured gender equity in athletics statewide. Across the board, the DOE’s gender \nequity policies and practices remain deficient. In failing to address the vast \ndisparities that remain, the DOE has shown that it acts only when individuals \nthreaten—or, in this case, file—legal action. \n                                              \n11 Id. at 42-43. \n12 Id. at 37. \n13 Curtis Lum, Baldwin Softball Will Get New Field, THE HONOLULU \nADVERTISER (Apr. 8, 2010), \nhttp://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2010/Apr/08/ln/hawaii4080344.html. \n  15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 18 of 68     PageID #:\n 1672\n48.  Female athletes at Campbell and across Hawaii have been waiting for \nnearly fifty years to receive the same treatment, benefits, and opportunities as male \nathletes as mandated by law. Instead of moving forward to close the gender gap, \nthe DOE appears to be going backwards. \n49.  It is precisely because of the DOE’s longstanding failure to comply \nwith Title IX that Plaintiffs file the present lawsuit.14 \nII.  The Unequal Female Athletic Experience at Campbell High School \n \n50.  Campbell is a four-year public high school located in Ewa Beach, \nOahu, and run by the DOE. \n                                              \n14 The DOE’s indifference to complying with Title IX is not limited to \nathletics. On December 20, 2017, the DOE and the United States Department of \nEducation entered into a resolution agreement to address deficiencies in the DOE’s \npolicies, procedures, and processes used for responding to complaints of \nharassment of students on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or disability. \nSee Resolution Agreement, OCR Docket No. 10-11-5003 (Dec. 20, 2017), \navailable at \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10115003-\nb.pdf. The United States Department of Education did not investigate—and \nconsequently the resolution agreement did not address—the DOE’s failure to \nprovide equal treatment, benefits, and opportunities in athletics under Title IX. See \nLetter from Linda Mangel, Regional Director, U.S. Department of Education, \nOffice for Civil Rights, to Dr. Christina Kishimoto, Superintendent, DOE (Jan. 19, \n2018), available at \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10115003-\na.pdf. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 19 of 68     PageID #:\n 1673\n51.  Of the DOE’s approximately 55 high schools statewide, Campbell \nserves the most students, matriculating 3,123 students in the 2017-2018 school \nyear. Of those students, 1,506 were female and 1,617 were male. \n52.  The female athletic experience at Campbell today is a byproduct of \nthe DOE’s historically inequitable treatment of female athletes in Hawaii’s public \nschools: female athletes receive worse treatment, fewer benefits, and fewer \nopportunities than male athletes. \n53.  Many aspects of the female athletic experience at Campbell are \ncontrolled or greatly influenced by the OIA, which through its policies and \npractices also treats female athletes inequitably by providing them worse treatment, \nfewer benefits, and fewer opportunities than male athletes. \n54.  Upon information and belief, the female athletic experience at other \nDOE high schools is substantially similar to that at Campbell. \nA. The DOE and the OIA’s Sex-Based Discrimination in Athletic \nTreatment and Benefits \n \n55.  The DOE has failed to provide an effective system for Title IX \nimplementation, monitoring, and compliance across its schools statewide. \n56.  Partly due to this lack of oversight, the DOE fails to provide equitable \nathletic treatment and benefits to Campbell female students in comparison to male \nstudents. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 20 of 68     PageID #:\n 1674\n57.  As described below, the DOE’s sex-based discrimination is evident in \nits: (i) athletic locker rooms, practice facilities, and competitive facilities; (ii) \nequipment and supplies; (iii) scheduling of games and practice times; (iv) \navailability and quality of coaching; (v) travel opportunities; (vi) medical and \ntraining services and facilities; and (vii) publicity and promotion.15 \n58.  As described below, the OIA’s sex-based discrimination is evident in \nits: (i) competitive facilities; (ii) scheduling of games; (iv) travel opportunities; and \n(iv) publicity and promotion. \ni.  Locker rooms, practice facilities, and competitive facilities \n \n1.  Absence of athletic locker room for female athletes \n \n59.  Campbell is one of the many DOE high schools that fails to provide \nathletic locker room facilities to female athletes while simultaneously providing \nsuch facilities to male athletes.16 \n                                              \n15 These are some of the factors that the U.S. Department of Education \nconsiders in determining whether a school provides equal athletics benefits and \nopportunities in compliance with Title IX. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c). \n16 DOE high schools usually have three types of locker rooms: P.E. locker \nrooms, gym locker rooms, and athletic locker rooms. P.E. locker rooms are used \nexclusively for physical education students during the school day. They are \ngenerally closed to student-athletes after school hours. Gym locker rooms are \nattached to the gym and primarily serve student-athletes participating in indoor \nsports (e.g., volleyball, basketball). Athletic locker rooms are typically stand-alone \nfacilities (often near the school’s athletic fields) that primarily serve student-\nathletes participating in outdoor sports (e.g., track and field, cross country, softball, \nbaseball, football, soccer). Such athletic locker rooms typically are substantially \nlarger and of higher quality than P.E. and gym locker rooms, and also contain more \n  18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 21 of 68     PageID #:\n 1675\n60.  Specifically, male athletes at Campbell have exclusive access to a \nstand-alone athletic locker room facility that is located near the athletic fields. This \nstandalone athletic locker room is a very large facility that is at least two times the \nsize of the gym-based locker room. The stand-alone athletic locker room has about \n120 full-size lockers, showers, and at least four bathroom stalls. The stand-alone \nathletic locker room also has air conditioning and an office. \n61.  By contrast, female athletes at Campbell have no standalone athletic \nlocker room facility, whether located near the athletic fields or elsewhere on \ncampus. That is, female athletes have no full-size lockers, no showers, no \nbathrooms, no air conditioning, and no office near the athletic fields.  \n62.  Instead, female athletes, including Plaintiffs, must carry their athletic \ngear around with them all day and have resorted to changing in teachers’ closets, in \nthe bathroom of the nearest Burger King, and even on the practice field, potentially \nin full view of bystanders. To use the bathroom, female athletes must run back to \nthe main campus, use decrepit porta-potties (which are sometimes locked), or face \ncrouching down in the bushes. Plaintiffs, who are part of the girls’ water polo \nprogram, sometimes have no practical choice but to change on the bus. \n                                              \namenities such as toilet stalls, larger and more numerous lockers, showers, and \noffices. Some DOE high schools have athletic locker rooms attached as annexes to \ngym locker rooms, rather than as stand-alone facilities. For the purpose of this \ncomplaint, “athletic locker room” refers to a school’s stand-alone athletic locker \nroom facility and/or any such annex to the gym locker room. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 22 of 68     PageID #:\n 1676\n63.  The absence of an athletic locker room facility has many negative \neffects on female athletes at Campbell. \n64.  Female athletes at Campbell, including Plaintiffs, experience constant \nstress and inconvenience from the lack of athletic locker room facilities. For \nexample, female athletes experience stress and inconvenience when they are forced \nto lug their equipment and gear throughout the school day. This interferes with \ntheir ability to concentrate on schoolwork during the academic day. \n65.  Female athletes at Campbell also experience stress and inconvenience \nwhen they struggle—after school ends and before sports practice begins—to find a \nplace in which to change into athletic attire. \n66.  Additionally, because they do not have access to athletic locker room \nfacilities, unlike their male counterparts, some female athletes at Campbell \nhurriedly shuttle home after school to gather equipment and change into practice \nattire. \n67.  Some female athletes at Campbell are penalized by their coaches \nwhen they show up late to practice because they cannot find places in which to \nchange, or because the places that they do find are overcrowded, costing them \nmore time to make the transition after school ends. \n68.  Campbell female athletes’ privacy is routinely compromised as a \nresult of the lack of access to locker room facilities. About half of the girls’ softball \n  20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 23 of 68     PageID #:\n 1677\nprogram and about half of the girls’ cross country program change in the bleachers \nby the field, with students holding up jackets to cover one another in an attempt to \npreserve their teammates’ privacy. Female athletes in the wrestling program also \nchange and conduct weigh-ins in the Campbell hallways. Female athletes in the \njudo program change and conduct weigh-ins in the corner of the gym or in the \nhallway, and male athletes sometimes walk in on the female athletes, including as \nrecently as two weeks ago. \n2.  Absence of practice facilities for female athletes \n69.  Campbell is one of the many DOE high schools at which girls’ sports \nprograms do not have adequate access to practice facilities. \n70.  The Campbell girls’ water polo program has been consistently treated \nunequally when it comes to securing practice facilities. For example, during the \n2017-18 school year, the DOE failed to secure a pool for the girls’ water polo \nprogram until after the season had already started. \n71.  As a result of the DOE’s inattention to girls’ sports, the Campbell \ngirls’ water polo program was left with no choice but to hold dry-land training \nsessions and open-ocean swim practices at Puuloa Beach Park. \n72.  Also, as a result of the DOE’s inattention to girls’ sports, the \nCampbell girls’ water polo program played at least two regular season games \nwithout having had a single minute of practice time in a pool. \n  21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 24 of 68     PageID #:\n 1678\n73.  In fact, the DOE’s failures with respect to the Campbell girls’ water \npolo program are memorialized in the 2018 Campbell yearbook: \n \n74.  This failure occurred even though the students, coaches, and parents \nassociated with the girls’ water polo program made various efforts in an attempt to \nget the DOE and the Campbell administration to secure a pool. \n  22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 25 of 68     PageID #:\n 1679\n75.  Worse, when members of the Campbell girls’ water polo program \ncontinued to raise their concerns with the Campbell Principal Jon Henry Lee and \nAthletic Director Samuel Delos Reyes, the Campbell administrators retaliated on at \nleast three separate occasions by threatening to “cancel” the water polo team, the \nwater polo season, or both. \n76.  By contrast, at the same time that the girls’ water polo program was \nlobbying the DOE and the Campbell administration to secure a practice facility, the \nAthletic Director was attempting to secure off-season athletic opportunities for the \nboys’ baseball and boys’ football programs. \n77.  The girls’ water polo program was approximately two weeks into the \ncompetitive season when the DOE finally secured a pool in which the girls’ water \npolo program could practice. \n78.  Additionally, although the DOE legally secured the pool by signing \nthe necessary paperwork, the Campbell girls’ water polo coach still had to use his \nown personal funds to pay to use a regulation-sized pool. The girls’ water polo \ncoach spent approximately $60 per day, two days a week, because the DOE would \nnot provide funding. \n79.  The Campbell girls’ water polo program’s experience during the \n2017-18 school year is not unique. For at least the five prior years, the girls’ water \npolo program had encountered similar problems gaining timely access to a pool in \n  23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 26 of 68     PageID #:\n 1680\nwhich to practice. For example, the girls’ water polo program has recently had to \npractice in a non-regulation pool divided and shared with neighboring rival, \nKapolei High School. \n80.  The Campbell cheerleading program17—which is all-female—also has \nbeen consistently treated unequally when it comes to securing practice facilities. \nThe Campbell cheerleading program has no dedicated practice facility and \nregularly has trouble finding places in which to practice. \n81.  Even when it finds a temporary space in which to practice, the \nCampbell cheerleading program is frequently displaced by other athletic programs. \nBecause of this displacement, the Campbell cheerleading program sometimes has \nto practice in the Campbell cafeteria, where students resort to changing behind \ntables. During at least some portion of the 2017-18 school year, the cheerleading \nprogram had nowhere to store its mats. \n3.  Unequal facilities \n                                              \n17 Plaintiffs do not have sufficient information to take a legal position on \nwhether cheerleading at Campbell counts as an interscholastic athletic activity for \nthe purpose of determining Title IX compliance. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ. Office for \nCivil Rights, Dear Colleague Letter: Athletic Activities Counted for Title IX \nCompliance (Sept. 17, 2008), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-20080917.html. \n  24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 27 of 68     PageID #:\n 1681\n82.  In addition to the complete absence of facilities for certain girls’ \nsports programs, the DOE provides unequal facilities to girls’ sports programs in \nrelation to boys’ sports programs. \n83.  For example, Campbell is one of the many DOE high schools at \nwhich the girls’ softball program’s facilities are unequal in relation to the boys’ \nbaseball program’s facilities.18 \n84.  The DOE provides the Campbell boys’ baseball program more \nfacilities and facilities of a higher quality than those provided to the girls’ softball \nprogram. The boys’ baseball program has a dedicated “baseball house,” with a \ncouch and mini-fridge, that is used to store equipment, hold meetings, and gather \nbefore practice. Additionally, the boys’ baseball program has a large storage \ncontainer in which to store gear and equipment. The boys’ baseball program has a \nbatting cage that is for its exclusive use. The boys’ baseball program has access to \nbathrooms in the stand-alone athletic locker room facility, or unisex porta-potties \nthat are conveniently located next to the baseball field. \n                                              \n18 According to the DOE, a renovation of the softball field is “currently in \nprogress,” but it is unclear when such renovation will be completed. In fact, as of \nApril 2018, the DOE reported that, rather than being in progress, the “[s]oftball \nfield renovations are in the planning stage.” Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board No. \n23 Meeting Minutes (Apr. 12, 2018), available at http://www.honolulu.gov/cms-\nnco-menu/site-nco-sitearticles/31332-ewa-nb-april-minutes.html. \n  25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 28 of 68     PageID #:\n 1682\n85.  By contrast, the DOE provides the girls’ softball program —which \nhas been Softball Division I state champions four times during the last eight \nyears19—few facilities and facilities of lower quality in comparison to their male \ncounterparts. The girls’ softball program has no dedicated “softball house”—or any \nfacility even remotely equivalent. The girls’ softball program has a storage \ncontainer, but it is half the size of the boys’ container and has so many cracks in \nthe roof that everything is ruined if softball players leave equipment in the \ncontainer when it rains. The girls’ softball program has no batting cage. The girls’ \nsoftball program has no access to bathroom facilities near the softball field, so they \nmust instead resort to using the porta-potties (which are located next to the \nbaseball field and are sometimes locked), running to the gym (which is located \nroughly two football fields in length away), or crouching down behind the storage \ncontainer. \n86.  The boys’ baseball field is also located closer to the school and on the \nbetter section of the shared athletic field area. Specifically, the baseball field is at a \nhigher elevation than the softball field. \n87.  The girls’ softball field, on the other hand, is located further away \nfrom the school and on the worst section of the shared athletic field area. Because \nthe softball field is at a lower elevation than the baseball field, when it rains, the \n                                              \n19 The boys’ baseball program has been champions once during that period.  \n  26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 29 of 68     PageID #:\n 1683\nsoftball field frequently floods and requires the use of sponges and other drainage \nmethods to make the field usable by the softball program. \n4.  Unequal facility maintenance \n88.  In addition to the stark disparities that exist between the athletic \nfacilities provided to boys relative to girls, the Campbell administration provides \nbetter maintenance regarding boys’ facilities as compared to girls’ facilities. \n89.  For example, the boys’ football program had its broken lights on the \nfootball field fixed immediately, whereas the girls’ soccer program could not even \nconvince the Campbell administration to install lights for after-dark practice and \ncompetition. \n90.  The soccer field is frequently irrigated during scheduled girls’ soccer \npractices, forcing the girls’ soccer program to practice inside the gym, which is \ndangerous because of the increased risk of slippage and knee injuries from the \nsmooth hard surface. \n91.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to athletic locker rooms, practice facilities, and competitive \nfacilities. Upon information and belief, this unequal provision of benefits has been \n  27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 30 of 68     PageID #:\n 1684\nlongstanding and has led to—and will continue to lead to—unequal practice and \ncompetitive facilities over time. \n92.  Thus, the DOE and the Campbell administration have a systematic \npolicy and practice of using limited resources and capacity to provide better \nathletic facilities and benefits to male athletes as compared to female athletes. \n5.  Unequal allocation of competitive facilities \n93.  The DOE and the OIA (which acts under the control of, and in close \ncoordination with, the DOE) determine which competitive facilities are used by \nathletic programs in DOE interscholastic athletic competition. \n94.  The DOE and the OIA unlawfully discriminate against female athletes \nby consistently allocating the prime competitive facilities to boys’ sports programs. \n95.  For example, upon information and belief, the DOE and the OIA grant \nthe boys’ football programs exclusive use of Aloha Stadium, which, as the largest \nstadium in Hawaii, is the premier competitive facility in the state. The Campbell \nboys’ football program used Aloha Stadium as recently as November 2, 2018, \nwhen it competed in an OIA championship playoff game against Farrington High \nSchool. The Campbell boys’ football program also competed there in an OIA \nplayoff game in October 2017. By contrast, upon information and belief, no girls’ \nsports program has ever had the opportunity to use Aloha Stadium for athletic \ncompetition. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 31 of 68     PageID #:\n 1685\nii.  Equipment and supplies \n \n96.  The provision of equipment and supplies is inequitable between \nfemale and male athletes at Campbell. \n97.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to equipment and supplies. Upon information and belief, this \nunequal provision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will \ncontinue to lead to—unequal equipment and supplies over time. \n98.  The DOE consistently does not provide proper equipment and gear to \nthe Campbell girls’ water polo program. For the most part, the girls’ water polo \nprogram relies on parents to use personal funds to purchase equipment. For \nexample, a couple years ago, parents bought replacement swimsuits for the water \npolo athletes because the DOE failed to provide them. The girls’ water polo \nprogram also used to have old swim caps that did not meet game regulations. \nThese old swim caps further posed a serious safety and choking hazard because \nthey were loose, stretched out, and often fell behind the athletes’ heads while \nhanging around their necks, which created more drag underwater and allowed \nopponents to pull the athletes underwater. \n  29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 32 of 68     PageID #:\n 1686\n99.  The girls’ soccer program experiences similar problems obtaining \nproper equipment and gear. For example, during the 2016-17 school year, a parent \nof a girls’ soccer team player used personal funds to purchase new uniforms \nbecause the DOE failed to provide them.  \n100.  Meanwhile, the football program has no trouble obtaining proper \nequipment and gear, which are refreshed on a regular basis. Upon information and \nbelief, the DOE provides the Campbell boys’ football program proper equipment, \ngear, and supplies. \niii.  Scheduling of games and practice time \n \n101.  The DOE and the OIA control and operate the scheduling of seasons, \ngames, and tournaments relating to interscholastic athletics in DOE schools. \n102.  The scheduling of games and practice times is inequitable between \nfemale and male athletes at Campbell. \n103.  Friday nights are considered prime time for athletic competition at \nCampbell because they draw the largest crowds and student and community \nsupport. However, based upon the publicly available schedules of Campbell sports \nprograms’ games in the 2018-19 school year, three quarters of the Friday night \nslots are designated for boys’ sports programs. By contrast, girls’ sports programs \nrarely play on Friday nights. \n  30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 33 of 68     PageID #:\n 1687\n104.  In fact, girls’ sports programs tend to play on less ideal days. For \nexample, during the 2017-18 school year, the girls’ softball program played many \nof its regular season games on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which are less ideal days \nthan Fridays or weekend days, because games in the middle of the week do not \ndraw large crowds and student and community support, and also interfere with \nstudent-athletes’ ability to attend school, complete homework, and study for tests. \n105.  By contrast, during the 2017-18 school year, the boys’ baseball \nprogram typically played regular season games on Fridays or weekend days. \n106.  This inequitable scheme is substantially the same regarding practice \ntime. The DOE illegally discriminates against practice times for girls’ sports in \nfavor of those for boys’ sports. \n107.  For example, the boys’ basketball program is allowed to hold double \npractices at the expense of the girls’ volleyball program. Specifically, the boys’ \nbasketball program displaces the girls’ volleyball program whenever the boys’ \nbasketball program decides it wants to have additional practice. \n108.  As another example, during the spring, even though the boys’ football \nprogram is in its off-season, it regularly displaces the track and field program. \n109.  The girls’ programs also practice during less preferable times in \nrelation to when the boys’ programs practice. \n  31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 34 of 68     PageID #:\n 1688\n110.  For example, even though the track and field program is co-\neducational, the girls’ track and field athletes almost always start their practice \nfirst, at around 3 p.m., when the heat and humidity is most oppressive. Meanwhile, \nthe boys’ track and field athletes start their practice later, at around 4:30 p.m., \nwhen the weather is cooler and the sun is less intense. \n111.  The girls’ soccer program practices on the field after the football \nprogram.  The field is often full of divots created by football practice, making it \ndangerous for the girls’ soccer program to practice and leading to increased \ninjuries. \niv.  Availability and quality of coaching \n \n112.  The DOE provides female student athletes at Campbell fewer \nopportunities to receive coaching in comparison to male student athletes. \n113.  Upon information and belief, the DOE does not provide female \nathletes the same or similar number of coaches as it provides male athletes. \nSpecifically, the DOE provides more coaches on a per-athlete basis to boys’ sports \nteams than to girls’ sports teams. \n114.  The DOE also discriminates against girls by failing timely to fill gaps \nin coaching positions for girls’ sports as compared to coaching positions for boys’ \nsports. Upon information and belief, Campbell presently has no girls’ varsity \nsoftball coach and no girls’ soccer coach. Upon information and belief, the \n  32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 35 of 68     PageID #:\n 1689\ncoaching vacancies for boys’ sports are filled more quickly than those for girls’ \nsports. Upon information and belief, the DOE and the Campbell administration \nillegally discriminate by hiring coaches for boys’ sports over girls’ sports. \n115.  Further, upon information and belief, the DOE does not provide \nfemale athletes coaches of the same experience and qualifications as those \nprovided to their male counterparts. Upon information and belief, the DOE hires \ncoaches for girls’ sports programs who are less experienced and qualified than \nthose hired for boys’ sports programs. \n116.  The DOE provides unequal compensation between coaches of girls’ \nsports programs and coaches of boys’ sports programs. \n117.  For example, for two of the past three years, the assistant coaches of \nthe girls’ water polo program did not receive any compensation. \n118.  Upon information and belief, the reason that the coaches for the girls’ \nwater polo program did not receive compensation is that the DOE decided to use \nthe monies allocated for the girls’ water polo program both to provide greater \ncompensation to boys’ football program coaches, and to provide more assistant \ncoaches to the boys’ football program. \n119.  Upon information and belief, every head coach and every assistant \ncoach of a boys’ sports team receives compensation for coaching services provided \nto Campbell’s male athletes. \n  33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 36 of 68     PageID #:\n 1690\n120.  Upon information and belief, and as a result of the disparities in \ncoaching described above, the tenure of coaches and assistant coaches for girls’ \nsports programs tends to be substantially shorter than the tenure of coaches and \nassistant coaches for boys’ sports programs. For example, the girls’ water polo \nprogram has had three different head coaches in the last four years, which has been \nincredibly disruptive to the water polo athletes. Indeed, both A.B. and T.T. have \nhad a different water polo coach each year they have attended Campbell. \n121.  The disparities in the number of coaches, their qualifications, their \ncompensation, and their tenure significantly reduce female athletes’ opportunities \nto grow as athletes, both individually and as a team. \n122.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to coaching. Upon information and belief, this unequal \nprovision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will continue to \nlead to—unequal coaching over time. \nv.  Travel opportunities \n123.  The DOE and the OIA control and operate the travel opportunities \nrelating to interscholastic athletics in DOE schools. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 37 of 68     PageID #:\n 1691\n124.  The DOE and the OIA’s provision of travel opportunities is \ninequitable between female and male athletes at Campbell. \n125.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to travel opportunities. Upon information and belief, this \nunequal provision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will \ncontinue to lead to—unequal travel opportunities over time. \n126.  The boys’ varsity football team frequently travels to neighbor islands \nin the State of Hawaii as well as to locations outside of the state for both in-season \nand off-season playing opportunities. \n127.  During the 2017-18 school year, the boys’ varsity football team \ntraveled to Las Vegas during the winter off-season to participate in a regional \ntournament. \n128.  During the 2018-19 school year, the boys’ varsity football team \ntraveled to the Big Island to play in a non-conference game against a Big Island-\nbased team. \n129.  During the 2018-19 school year, the Campbell Athletic Director \ncontracted for the boys’ varsity football team to travel to Phoenix, Arizona, for a \nweek-long “road trip” that included games against a Phoenix-based football team. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 38 of 68     PageID #:\n 1692\n130.  As another example, during the 2017-18 school year, the boys’ varsity \nbaseball team flew to the Big Island and Maui for some of its games and \ntournaments. \n131.  Girls’ varsity sports teams do not have—and have not had—similar \nopportunities to travel off the island of Oahu or out of state for practice, \ncompetition, or other forms of athletic enrichment. \nvi.  Medical and training services and facilities \n \n132.  Female student-athletes experience the inequitable provision of \nmedical and training services, and inequitable access to such facilities in \ncomparison to their male counterparts. \n133.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to medical and training services and facilities. Upon \ninformation and belief, this unequal provision of benefits has been longstanding \nand has led to—and will continue to lead to—unequal medical and training \nservices and facilities over time. \n134.  For example, during the 2017-18 school year cross country season, on \nat least one occasion, female cross country athletes were seeking treatment from \nthe trainers in the gym. When members of the boys’ football program entered the \n  36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 39 of 68     PageID #:\n 1693\ntraining room, the female cross country athletes were asked to move aside so that \nthe boys’ football players could be treated first. \n135.  Trainers are less likely to be present at girls’ games than boys’ games.  \n136.  For example, for several years before the present school year, the \nCampbell trainers did not attend a single girls’ water polo game. \n137.  The 2017-18 school year was the first year in the past four years that \nthe Campbell trainers attended a girls’ water polo game. Nonetheless, Campbell \ntrainers attended only about three of the twelve games that the girls’ water polo \nteam played during the 2017-18 school year. Notably, the Campbell trainers were \nrelied on by the water polo team to address injuries each time they were present at \ngames, showing that they play a necessary and valuable role in athletics. \n138.  Upon information and belief, at least one Campbell trainer attends \nevery boys’ football or boys’ baseball game. \n139.  Because of the DOE’s discrimination, Campbell female athletes have \nbeen put at increased risk of injury. For example, three seasons ago, a water polo \nathlete was experiencing hyperventilation, a panic attack, and muscle cramps. No \nCampbell trainer was present for the game, and the athlete was lucky to be able to \nrely on a non-Campbell trainer to address her medical needs. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 40 of 68     PageID #:\n 1694\nvii.  Publicity and promotion \n \n140.  The DOE and the OIA control and operate the publicity and \npromotion relating to interscholastic athletics in DOE schools. \n141.  Upon information and belief, girls’ sports are less often publicized \nand promoted by the DOE and the OIA, and when girls’ sports are publicized and \npromoted, female athletes are often recognized merely as an afterthought. \n142.  Upon information and belief, the DOE uses funding, accepts \ncontributions, or allows funding to be used (regardless of source) to provide \nunequal athletic treatment and benefits to male athletes as compared to female \nathletes with respect to publicity and promotion. Upon information and belief, this \nunequal provision of benefits has been longstanding and has led to—and will \ncontinue to lead to—unequal publicity and promotion over time. \n143.  The DOE and the OIA illegally discriminate by consistently giving \npreferential treatment to the Campbell boys’ football program and the boys’ \nbaseball program with respect to publicity and promotion, including, as previously \nalleged, as a result of the inequitable scheduling of games. Specifically, when \nboys’ athletic programs receive better schedules (such as Friday and weekend \ndays), they are more likely to receive media coverage, and people are more likely \nto be available to watch. \n  38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 41 of 68     PageID #:\n 1695\n144.  The girls’ sports programs do not receive similar publicity and \npromotion, including as a result of the inequitable scheduling of games. \n145.  The “Photo Albums” page of the Campbell website is instructive of \nthis disparity between the promotion of girls’ sports and boys’ sports. The \nCampbell website includes albums on various school events, including \nhomecoming, graduation, contests, and athletics.20 Yet, all of the athletics-related \nphoto albums on the Campbell website are of the boys’ football program. In fact, \nof the approximately 600 total photos on the “Photo Albums” page of the \nCampbell website, over 250 photos—or over 44% of all Campbell photos—depict \nthe boys’ football program. \n146.  By contrast, zero photo albums—and, upon information and belief, \nzero photos—on the “Photo Albums” page of the Campbell website depict a girls’ \nsports program. \n147.  Additionally, the DOE decided to schedule cheer and band only for \nfootball athletic events. Therefore, the Campbell cheerleaders and band do not \nattend any girls’ athletic events or promote any of the girls’ sports programs. \n148.  The DOE and the Campbell administration inequitably publicize and \npromote girls’ sports in other ways. \n                                              \n20 See https://www.campbellhigh.org/apps/album/#!&s=0 \n  39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 42 of 68     PageID #:\n 1696\n149.  For example, the DOE and the Campbell administration have failed \non several occasions to recognize the girls’ water polo program. During one \nathletic award assembly at which every sports program was to be recognized, the \nCampbell administration completely forgot about the water polo program. Because \nthe Campbell administration forgot about the water polo program, a Campbell staff \nmember scribbled lettering on a poster while the assembly was already occurring \nas a belated attempt to recognize the water polo program. \n150.  During a separate pep rally, the Campbell administration recognized \nthe achievements of various Campbell sports programs, but again failed to \nrecognize those of the girls’ water polo program—even though the team had \nadvanced to the state championship for the first time that season. \n151.  The Campbell Athletic Director has a history of making disparaging \nremarks towards the girls’ water polo program. For example, at one game during \nthe 2014-15 school year, the Athletic Director joked that, if the water polo program \nwas going to lose, Campbell should not even have a water polo program. Despite \nthe Athletic Director’s remark, the Campbell girls’ water polo program won that \ngame. \nB. The DOE’s Failure to Effectively Accommodate Female Students’ \nInterest and Abilities Regarding Participation Opportunities \n \n152.  During the 2017-18 school year, Campbell had 3,123 students \nenrolled: 1,506 students were girls and 1,617 were boys. Thus, girls represent \n  40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 43 of 68     PageID #:\n 1697\nabout 48.2% of the student body at Campbell, while boys represent about 51.8% of \nthe student body. \n153.  However, based on information and belief and incomplete available \ndata,21 there are approximately 345 female athletes and 484 male athletes at \nCampbell. This means that female athletes account for about 41.6% of the athletic \nopportunities at Campbell, while male athletes account for about 58.4% of the \nathletic opportunities. \n154.  Thus, there exists a 6.6 percentage-point participation gap between \nfemale athletic participation and female student body enrollment.22 \n155.  Based on this participation gap, at least 106 additional opportunities \nfor female athletes must be added to meet part one of the Title IX’s three-part test \n(substantial proportionality). \n                                              \n21 The ACLU of Hawaii sent the DOE a public records request under the \nUniform Information Practices Act (“UIPA”) asking for, among other things, \n“gender participation rates in athletic programs, teams, and opportunities from the \n2009-2010 school year to present.” \n22 The “participation gap” is the difference, expressed in percentage points, \nbetween the percentage of students who are girls and the percentage of athletic \nparticipation opportunities (as measured by the number of roster spots) provided to \ngirls. The participation gap is a key measure used to assess Title IX compliance. \nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights collects athletic \nparticipation data from public schools nationwide as part of the Civil Rights Data \nCollection. See Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Civil Rights \nData Collection, https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 44 of 68     PageID #:\n 1698\n156.  Upon information and belief, the DOE does not have a history and \ncontinuing practice of expanding athletic programs for girls at Campbell, and \ntherefore do not satisfy part two of the three-part test. \n157.  The DOE will not establish that they have met Campbell girls’ \ninterests and abilities in playing sports in greater numbers, regarding part three of \nthe three-part test. \nIII.  The DOE’s Responses to Title IX Complaints \nA. Retaliation \n \n158.  Under Title IX, a plaintiff is not obligated to provide notice or to \nexhaust administrative remedies. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs and other Campbell \nfemale athletes, and their parents and coaches, have made numerous written and \noral requests seeking equal accommodation and attempting to engage in \ndiscussions with the DOE towards that end. Despite these efforts, the DOE’s \ndiscrimination against and unequal treatment of Plaintiffs has been persistent and \nongoing. And instead of addressing Plaintiffs’ concerns, the DOE has retaliated \nagainst Plaintiffs. \n159.  On many occasions, Plaintiffs and their female athlete classmates, \nparents, and coaches have complained to the DOE and voiced their concerns about \nthe unfair treatment that female athletes have received at Campbell. \n  42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 45 of 68     PageID #:\n 1699\n160.  The DOE and the Campbell administration have not addressed the \ncomplaints or concerns raised by the female athletes of Campbell. \n161.  Instead of addressing the female athletes’ serious concerns, the DOE \nand the Campbell administrators retaliated. For example, the DOE and the \nCampbell administrators, on at least three separate occasions, threatened to \n“cancel” the water polo team, the water polo season, or both. \n162.  The DOE and the Campbell administrators also retaliated by \nincreasing their scrutiny of, showing more hostility towards, and withholding \nresources, funding, coaching, and other support from the girls’ water polo program. \nFor example, the DOE and the Campbell administrators withheld funding by \nrefusing to sign a $1,000 grant that was given to the water polo program, which \nforced the program to seek assistance from a different non-profit organization. As \nanother example, shortly after one heated meeting among water polo athletes, their \nparents, and the Campbell Principal and Athletic Director, the Campbell \nadministrators informed the water polo athletes that about half of the program’s \npaperwork (e.g., doctor’s physical evaluation forms, parental consent forms) was \nmissing. Even though this paperwork had, in fact, been completed and submitted \nby the water polo athletes, the Campbell administrators told the water polo athletes \nthat they needed to resubmit all of these forms. \n  43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 46 of 68     PageID #:\n 1700\nB. Inaction \n \n163.  On February 9, 2018, the ACLU of Hawaii sent a letter to various \nDOE officials—including Superintendent Christina Kishimoto, Assistant \nSuperintendent for School Facilities and Support Services Dann Carlson, and Civil \nRights Compliance Office Director Anne Marie Puglisi—regarding sex \ndiscrimination against female athletes in Hawaii. Among other things, the letter \nnoted that fourteen DOE high schools “do not have athletic locker rooms for \nfemale students, while having such facilities for male students.” \n164.  The letter requested that, by March 12, 2018, the DOE respond with \n“a plan that concretely addresses the glaring inequality between girls’ and boys’ \nathletic facilities in DOE schools.” The letter also requested that that plan ensure \nthat DOE schools become “fully compliant with Title IX by the first day of the \n2018-19 school year.” \n165.  On March 2, 2018, the DOE sponsored three 45-minute-long meetings \nat Campbell in which representatives from each of the Campbell girls’ sports \nprograms met with Title IX compliance specialists from the DOE’s Civil Rights \nCompliance Office to raise concerns about gender equity in athletics.23 \n                                              \n23 The DOE’s Civil Rights Compliance Office was recently renamed the \n“Civil Rights Compliance Branch.” See \nhttp://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/ConnectWithUs/Organization/OfficesAndBra\nnches/Pages/CRCO.aspx. \n  44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 47 of 68     PageID #:\n 1701\n166.  The ACLU of Hawaii represented some of the students and parents at \nthe March 2, 2018 meetings. \n167.  Upon information and belief, the DOE has not made any meaningful \nchanges to the athletics program at Campbell or other DOE schools in response to \nthese March 2, 2018 meetings and/or other similar meetings held at other DOE \nschools. \n168.  The ACLU of Hawaii repeatedly requested that the DOE share its past \nand present Title IX compliance plans and policies, including its written plan to \naddress the inequities described in the February 9, 2018 demand letter. \n169.  Concerned by the DOE’s failure to provide meaningful information \nabout its Title IX compliance findings, plans, and processes, the ACLU of Hawaii \nturned to public records requests under the Uniform Information Practices Act \n(“UIPA”) to obtain information on the DOE’s past and present Title IX compliance \nefforts. In response to these requests, the ACLU of Hawaii received few \ndocuments and little clarity about the DOE’s Title IX compliance efforts.  \n170.  More specifically, on July 12, 2018, the ACLU of Hawaii submitted a \nUIPA request seeking information regarding (1) Campbell’s athletic facilities, \nincluding their use by sport and gender; (2) Campbell’s athletic budgets, including \nline items broken down by team and gender; (3) DOE policies and plans regarding \nathletic budgeting and financial decision-making; (4) findings, conclusions, and \n  45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 48 of 68     PageID #:\n 1702\nrecommendations from the gender equity assessments and site visits that the DOE \npurported to conduct in or around March 2018; (5) enrollment data by gender and \ngender participation rates in athletic programs; and (6) other plans and policies to \nremedy already-identified and future gender-based disparities. \n171.  In response to this July 12, 2018 request, the DOE provided very few \ndocuments, some of which were publicly available, and almost all of which \nprovided insufficient detail. In fact, excluding coaching payroll data, the DOE \nprovided only four documents, totaling nine pages. One of these documents was a \npublicly available campus map. Another was a 1.5-page document purporting to be \na “System of Self-Assessment, Reporting, and Monitoring” for Title IX \ncompliance in DOE athletic programs. Notably, the DOE withheld all records \nrelating to the March 2018 assessments and site visits and its plans to remedy \nalready-identified gender-based disparities “due to government frustration.” The \nDOE also redacted all names from the payroll data it provided, even though H.R.S. \n§ 92F-12(a)(14) requires the disclosure of, among other things, the name and \ncompensation of state employees. Despite the paucity of records provided by the \nDOE, it nevertheless affirmed that “[e]very record found to be responsive [wa]s \nprovided in its entirety.” \n172.  On August 27, 2018, the ACLU of Hawaii submitted a second UIPA \nrequest again seeking more information regarding (1) features and dimensions of \n  46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 49 of 68     PageID #:\n 1703\nCampbell’s athletic facilities; (2) Campbell’s athletic rosters; (3) the names, \npositions, and compensation of all athletic staff at Campbell; and (4) the DOE’s \npolicies and procedures regarding athletic coaching. \n173.  In response to this August 27, 2018 request, the DOE provided three \ndocuments and one spreadsheet: a document with architectural plans for Campbell, \na document containing payroll data showing the names of the athletic staff, a \nspreadsheet outlining DOE’s athletic position pay rates, and an “Athletic \nHandbook” dated June 2009. The DOE also provided partially redacted rosters. \n174.  In sum, despite multiple attempts through several different avenues, \nthe DOE continues to place the issues of Title IX compliance and gender equity \nwithin a black box that is shielded from public scrutiny. \n175.  The discrimination against the female athletes of Campbell persists \ntoday in the midst of the fifth month of the 2018-19 school year. \n176.  The DOE, through its actions and omissions—and the actions and \nomissions of its officials, employees, and agents, including the OIA—has engaged \nand continues to engage in gender-based discrimination against girls who desire to \nplay scholastic competitive-level sports for Campbell. \n177.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to end Defendants’ ongoing and \nsystematic violations of the basic civil rights of girls who participate, or desire to \nparticipate, in the Campbell athletics program. \n  47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 50 of 68     PageID #:\n 1704\n178.  As discussed above, these violations are symptomatic of pervasive, \nsystemic and longstanding practices and policies of Defendants that deny girls an \nequal opportunity to participate in athletic programs and enjoy the breadth of \neducational, health, and professional benefits that flow from such participation. \nIV.  The Effects of the Unequal Treatment and Opportunities for Female \nAthletes \n \n179.  Plaintiffs are under no obligation to show particular negative effects to \nprove Title IX violations. \n180.  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs take this opportunity to assert the harms they \nhave suffered. Defendants’ unequal treatment has many negative consequences on \nPlaintiffs’ academic performance, athletic performance, family obligations, and \nability to obtain athletic scholarships for college. \n181.  Additionally, because of Defendants’ unlawful treatment, Plaintiffs \nbelieve they and fellow female athletes are valued less—that they are second-class. \nIndeed, as one court has found, the practice of providing such unequal treatment \n“sends the clear message that female athletes are subordinate to their male \ncounterparts, and that girls’ sports take a backseat to boys’ sports.” Communities \nfor Equity v. Michigan High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 178 F. Supp. 2d 805, 836 (W.D. \nMich. 2001), aff’d, 459 F.3d 676 (6th Cir. 2006). Similarly, in the 2010 lawsuit \nconcerning Maui’s Baldwin High School, Judge Ezra elaborated on how “the \npsychological aspects” of gender inequities “are huge for girls”: \n  48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 51 of 68     PageID #:\n 1705\nWhen these boys run out on that stadium field, they have a sense of \npride. It fills them with a sense that they have accomplished \nsomething. When a girl is relegated to running out on a dirt field in \nsome park, are they filled with the same kind of pride? I don’t think \nso. And I don’t think it takes a genius to figure out those differences.24 \n \n182.  Because of the inequities perpetuated by Defendants, Campbell also \nloses out on opportunities to host games, tournaments, and other competitions for \ngirls’ sports, which further negatively impacts female athletes’ educational and \nathletic experiences. \n183.  Additionally, the poor treatment results in Campbell female athletes \nfailing to achieve their full athletic potential, and thereby losing out on \nopportunities to win scholarships for post-secondary education. \n184.  For example, because of the consistent manner in which the DOE fails \nto provide or delays providing a pool in which to practice, A.B., A.M.B., T.T., and \nA.P., and their teammates are deprived of opportunities to practice in regulation \nwater polo conditions, and to practice the specific skills required to excel as water \npolo athletes. Similarly, because of the consistent manner in which the DOE \nunlawfully discriminates in providing sufficient and high-quality coaching—\nthereby leading to frequent changes in coaching staff—A.B., A.M.B., T.T., and \nA.P., and their teammates constantly have to form new relationships and adapt to \n                                              \n24 Nobriga v. Dep’t of Educ., State of Hawaii, 1:10-cv-159-DAE-LK, Doc. \n37, at 34 (D. Haw. Apr. 7, 2010). \n  49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 52 of 68     PageID #:\n 1706\neach coach’s communication and coaching style. This further prevents A.B., \nA.M.B., T.T., and A.P., and their teammates from reaching their full potential as \nwater polo athletes. \n185.  As another example, T.T.’s negative experience with the Campbell \nathletics program has put her collegiate scholarship opportunities at risk. As a \nsophomore, T.T. was one of Hawaii’s top high school water polo athletes. As a \njunior, T.T. aspired again to be one of the state’s top athletes. College scouts \nreached out to her expressing interest in her athletic abilities. But T.T.’s aspirations \nwere severely hampered by the DOE’s failure to timely provide access to a pool \nfor the Campbell girls’ water polo program during the 2017-18 school year. By the \ntime the water polo season had started, the team had not yet set foot in a pool for \npractice because the DOE had failed to secure a pool for the program. Thrown off \nby the inability to practice in a pool, the Campbell girls’ water polo team lost two \nof its first four games. As a result of the DOE’s inequitable treatment of the girls’ \nwater polo team, T.T. could not perform as well as she would have liked. T.T. \nmissed out on improving her water polo play statistics, which are important to \ncollege scouts. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n186.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n  50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 53 of 68     PageID #:\n 1707\n187.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and on \nbehalf of a class of all those similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nDefinition \n188.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all present and future Campbell \nfemale students and potential students who participate, seek to participate, and/or \nare or were deterred from participating in athletics at Campbell (the “Class”). \nNumerosity \n189.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  \n190.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that in \nthe 2017-18 school year, the latest time period during which information is \npublicly available, there were 1,506 female students in grades 9-12 at Campbell \nand approximately 345 female students in the athletics program. \n191.  It is unknown how many additional current female students or how \nmany additional future female students would seek to participate in interscholastic \nathletics if additional opportunities were available. Moreover, members of the \nClass who may suffer future injury are not capable of being precisely identified at \nthis time, as the Class includes future Campbell female athletes. Upon information \nand belief, accordingly, class members number in the hundreds and possibly \nthousands. \n  51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 54 of 68     PageID #:\n 1708\nCommon Questions of Law and Fact \n192.  Common questions of law and fact predominate, and include: (a) \nwhether current and future female student athletes at Campbell are receiving \nunequal treatment and benefits in comparison to the male student athletes; (b) \nwhether current and future female students at Campbell are being deprived of \nequal opportunities to participate in interscholastic sports; and (c) whether current \nand future female students at Campbell are being retaliated against for complaining \nabout sex discrimination. \nTypicality \n193.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the \nClass. The type of discrimination and retaliation that Plaintiffs have suffered as a \nresult of sex include: receipt of unequal treatment and benefits in Campbell’s \nsports programs in addition to exclusion from opportunities to participate in sports \nprograms at Campbell.  Such discrimination is typical of the sex discrimination \nthat members of the Class have suffered, are suffering, and, unless this Court \ngrants relief, will continue to suffer. \n194.  A.B. is a typical member of the proposed class. She is a current \nfemale student athlete at Campbell for the 2018-19 school year who is subject to \ndiscriminatory unequal participation opportunities due to Defendants’ failure to \naccommodate female students’ athletic interests and abilities as well as provide \n  52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 55 of 68     PageID #:\n 1709\nequal treatment and benefits to female student athletes. Defendants have subjected \nA.B. to sex-based discrimination. \n195.  A.M.B. is a typical member of the proposed class. She is a current \nfemale student athlete at Campbell from the 2018-19 school year who is subject to \ndiscriminatory unequal participation opportunities due to Defendants’ failure to \naccommodate female students’ athletic interests and abilities as well as provide \nequal treatment and benefits to female student athletes. Defendants have subjected \nA.M.B. to sex-based discrimination. \n196.  T.T. is a typical member of the proposed class. She is a current female \nstudent athlete at Campbell for the 2018-19 school year who is subject to \ndiscriminatory unequal participation opportunities due to Defendants’ failure to \naccommodate female students’ athletic interests and abilities as well as provide \nequal treatment and benefits to female student athletes. Defendants have subjected \nT.T. to sex-based discrimination. \n197.  A.P. is a typical member of the proposed class. She is a current female \nstudent athlete at Campbell for the 2019-20 school year who is subject to \ndiscriminatory unequal participation opportunities due to Defendants’ failure to \naccommodate female students’ athletic interests and abilities as well as provide \nequal treatment and benefits to female student athletes. Defendants have subjected \nA.P. to sex-based discrimination. \n  53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 56 of 68     PageID #:\n 1710\nAdequacy of Representation \n198.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect \nthe interests of the Class because they seek relief on behalf of the Class they \nrepresent as a whole and have no interest antagonistic to other members of the \nClass. Plaintiffs intend to prosecute this action rigorously in order to secure \nremedies for the entire class. \n199.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by counsel from the ACLU of \nHawaii; Legal Aid at Work; and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. Counsel are \nexperienced in state and federal civil rights litigation and class actions, including \nspecifically Title IX class action litigation. \nRule 23(b)(2) \n200.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final declaratory and injunctive \nrelief with respect to the Class as a whole under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n201.  An actual and immediate controversy exists between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants, which parties have genuine and opposing interests and which interests \nare direct and substantial. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants violated their rights \nand the rights of the Class under federal anti-discrimination law. Plaintiffs are \n  54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 57 of 68     PageID #:\n 1711\ninformed and believe and, based thereon, allege that Defendants deny these \nallegations. Declaratory relief is therefore necessary and appropriate. \n202.  Plaintiffs and the class members have no plain, adequate, or complete \nremedy at law. Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to infringe \non Plaintiffs’ and class members’ statutory rights and will continue to inflict \nirreparable injury. This threat of injury to Plaintiffs and class members from \ncontinuing violations requires permanent injunctive relief. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 \net seq. and Its Implementing Regulations \n(Unequal Treatment and Benefits in Athletic Programs) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n203.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n204.  Title IX provides: “No person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .” 20 U.S. C. § \n1681(a).  \n205.  Since the passage of Title IX, the DOE has received and continues to \nreceive federal financial assistance and the benefits therefrom. Therefore, all of the \nDOE’s programs, including its athletic programs, and all officials, employees \n  55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 58 of 68     PageID #:\n 1712\nand/or agents of the DOE, are bound by the requirements of Title IX and its \nimplementing regulations. 20 U.S.C. § 1687. This includes the OIA, which both is \na part of, and controls, the DOE’s athletic programs. \n206.  Title IX’s implementing regulations provide: “No person shall, on the \nbasis of sex, . . . be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another \nperson or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, \nclub or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and the recipient shall provide \nany such athletics separately on such basis.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a).  \n207.  Under Title IX, schools must provide “equal treatment and benefits” \nto members of both sexes in their athletic programs. 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (1979), \nthe Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights’ 1979 Policy Interpretation \n(“1979 Policy Interpretation”). Equal treatment and benefits are assessed based on \nan overall comparison of the male and female student athletic programs, including \nan analysis of the following factors, among other considerations: “The provision of \nequipment and supplies; Scheduling of games and practice time; Opportunity to \nreceive coaching . . .; Assignment and compensation of coaches . . .; Provision of \nlocker rooms, practice and competitive facilities; Provision of medical and training \nfacilities and services; . . . Publicity” and a school’s “failure to provide necessary \nfunds for teams for one sex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)–(10). See also Ollier v. \nSweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 858 F. Supp. 2d 1093, 1115 (S.D. Cal. 2012), \n  56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 59 of 68     PageID #:\n 1713\nenforced, No. 07CV714-L JMA, 2014 WL 1028431 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 17, 2014), \naff’d, 768 F.3d 843 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding “[d]efendants have violated Title IX in \nfailing to provide equal treatment and benefits,” with respect to plaintiffs’ \ntreatment and benefits claim). \n208.  The Title IX implementing regulations required that sponsors of \ninterscholastic athletics comply with the regulations within three years of their \neffective date, or by July 21, 1978, at the latest. The regulations further require that \nsponsors of interscholastic athletics take such remedial actions as are necessary to \novercome the effects of sex discrimination in violation of Title IX. 34 C.F.R. \n§106.3(a). \n209.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that \nDefendants have not taken remedial actions and that any remedial actions which \nDefendants have taken in the past have been insufficient to satisfy Defendants’ \nobligations under Title IX. \n210.  Defendants have violated Title IX and its implementing regulations by \ndiscriminating against female students, including Plaintiffs, by, among other \nthings, failing to provide female student athletes from Campbell with treatment and \nbenefits that are comparable to the treatment and benefits provided to male student \nathletes. \n  57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 60 of 68     PageID #:\n 1714\n211.  Defendants’ inequitable treatment of Campbell female athletes \ndemonstrates Defendants’ failure to comply with Title IX. \n212.  As a proximate result of these unlawful acts, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave suffered and continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n213.  Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to relief, including declaratory \nrelief and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 \net seq. and Its Implementing Regulations \n(Unequal Participation Opportunities in Athletic Programs) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n214.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n215.  Title IX provides: “No person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participating in . . . or be subjected to discrimination under any \neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S. C. § \n1681(a). \n216.  Title IX’s implementing regulations provide: “No person shall, on the \nbasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, . . . or otherwise be discriminated \nagainst in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered \n  58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 61 of 68     PageID #:\n 1715\nby a recipient, and the recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such \nbasis.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a). \n217.  Under Title IX, schools must provide both sexes equivalent athletic \nparticipation opportunities. See 1979 Policy Interpretation. \n218.  “In determining whether equal opportunities are available,” it must be \nconsidered, “[w]hether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively \naccommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes” 34 C.F.R. § \n106.41(c)(1); see also Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 604 F. Supp. 2d \n1264, 1275 (S.D. Cal. 2009), aff’d, 768 F.3d 843 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding \n“defendants are not in compliance with Title IX based on unequal participation \nopportunities in athletic program,” with respect to plaintiffs’ unequal participation \nopportunities claim). \n219.  Compliance in the area of equivalent participation opportunities is \ndetermined by a three-part test. \n220.  The first part of the test considers: “Whether intercollegiate level \nparticipation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers \nsubstantially proportionate to their respective enrollments[.]” Id. at 71,418 (Section \nVII(C)(5)(a)(1)). \n221.  The second part of the test considers: “Where the members of one sex \nhave been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, whether the \n  59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 62 of 68     PageID #:\n 1716\ninstitution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which \nis demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of the members \nof that sex[.]” Id. at 71,418 (Section VII(C)(5)(a)(2)). \n222.  The third part of the test considers: “Where the members of one sex \nare underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the institution cannot \nshow a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above, whether \nit can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex \nhave been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.” Id. at \n71,418 (Section VII(C)(5)(a)(3)). \n223.  Although the 1979 Policy Interpretation refers to “intercollegiate” \nsports, it also applies to high schools. See Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. \nDist., 768 F.3d 843, 855 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[T]he three-part test applies to a high \nschool.”); see also McCormick ex rel. McCormick v. School Dist. of Mamaroneck, \n370 F.3d 275, 300 (2d Cir. 2004) (applying three-part test to high school). Indeed, \nTitle IX is applicable to all recipients of federal education funds, including high \nschools, and thus the 1979 Policy Interpretation is applicable to interscholastic \nhigh school sports as well as intercollegiate sports. 34 C.F.R. § 106.11. \n224.  With respect to the first part of the three-part test, Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the ratio of female to male \n  60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 63 of 68     PageID #:\n 1717\nathletes at Campbell is not substantially proportionate to the overall ratio of \nenrolled female to male students at Campbell. \n225.  Further, with respect to the second part of the three-part test, \nDefendants cannot show “a history and continuing practice of program expansion \nwhich is demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities” of \nCampbell’s female students. Mansourian v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 602 F.3d \n958, 965 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Office for Civil Rights, Guidance: The Three-Part \nTest (1996)). Rather, female students have historically been and continue to be \nunderrepresented in the Campbell and DOE athletics programs. Defendants bear \nthe burden on part two, an affirmative defense, and must show a history and \ncontinuing practice of adding athletic opportunities for females. See Ollier v. \nSweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 768 F.3d 843, 857-58 (9th Cir. 2014). \n226.  Finally, with respect to part three of the three-part test, despite this \nunderrepresentation and despite the interests and abilities of female students at \nCampbell to participate on additional teams, Defendants have not adequately met \nthe interests and abilities of female student-athletes. \n227.  As a proximate result of these unlawful acts, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave suffered and continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n228.  Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to relief, including declaratory \nrelief and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n  61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 64 of 68     PageID #:\n 1718\n229.  Such injunctive relief may include, but is not limited to, the provision \nof the full range of teams and participation slots in existing sports, with teams for \nall grade levels, including novice, junior varsity, and varsity-level opportunities for \nfemale student athletes. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 \net seq. and Its Implementing Regulations \n(Retaliation) \n(Against Defendant DOE Only) \n \n230.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as though fully \ncontained herein, the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs. \n231.  Title IX and its implementing regulations prohibit retaliation for \ncomplaints of sex discrimination. See Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 \nU.S. 167, 171 (2005); Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 768 F.3d 843, \n869 (9th Cir. 2014). \n232.  On several occasions, Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other Class \nmembers complained to the DOE about its unequal treatment of the Campbell \ngirls’ water polo program. These complaints were submitted in both oral and \nwritten form.  \n233.  Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other Class members also engaged in \nboth individual and entire-team meetings with the Campbell Principal and Athletic \nDirector to discuss this unequal treatment. During these meetings, Plaintiffs A.B. \n  62 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 65 of 68     PageID #:\n 1719\nand T.T. and other Class members—sometimes with their parents—expressed \nconcern about the inequitable way that the DOE treated the Campbell girls’ water \npolo program, as evidenced most strikingly by the DOE’s continual failure to \ntimely secure a practice facility for the team. \n234.  After Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other Class members complained \nabout the DOE’s sex discrimination, the DOE retaliated by threatening, on at least \nthree separate occasions, to “cancel” the water polo program, the water polo \nseason, or both. As noted above, on at least one occasion, the Campbell Athletic \nDirector joked that, if the water polo program was going to lose a game, Campbell \nshould not even have a water polo program. \n235.  Upon information and belief, after Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other \nClass members complained about the DOE’s sex discrimination, the DOE \nretaliated by increasing its scrutiny of, and showing more hostility towards, the \nCampbell girls’ water polo program. This includes the DOE’s instruction that \nCampbell water polo athletes resubmit athletic paperwork that the athletes had \nalready submitted, as noted above. \n236.  Upon information and belief, after Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. and other \nClass members complained about the DOE’s sex discrimination, the DOE also \nretaliated by deliberately withholding resources, funding, coaching, and other \nsupport from the girls’ water polo program that it otherwise would have provided \n  63 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 66 of 68     PageID #:\n 1720\nhad Plaintiffs and other Class members not lodged complaints. This includes the \nwithholding of funding by refusing to sign a $1,000 grant, as noted above. \n237.  Also, as a result of the DOE’s retaliatory acts, Plaintiffs A.B., A.M.B., \nT.T., and A.P. and other Class members are concerned that the DOE will retaliate \nagain if they continue to complain about the DOE’s sex discrimination. Plaintiffs \nA.B., A.M.B., T.T., and A.P. and other Class members are dissuaded from raising \nthe issue of sex discrimination with the DOE. \n238.  The DOE’s retaliatory acts have also created a chilling effect among \nCampbell’s female athletes regarding identifying and complaining about other \ngender inequities in athletics to the DOE. \n239.  The DOE’s retaliatory acts were motivated by Plaintiffs A.B. and T.T. \nand other Class members lodging their complaints of sex discrimination. \n240.  As a proximate result of these unlawful acts, Plaintiffs and the Class \nhave suffered and continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n241.  Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to relief, including declaratory \nrelief and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the other class members pray that this Court: \nA.  Assume jurisdiction over this action; \n  64 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00477-LEK-RT   Document 116   Filed 09/26/19   Page 67 of 68     PageID #:\n 1721\nB.

Enter an order declaring that Defendants have discriminated on the \nbasis of sex against female students in violation of Title IX; \nD.  Enter an order declaring that Defendant DOE has retaliated against \nfemale students in violation of Title IX; \nE.

Retain jurisdiction over Defendants until such time as the Court is \nsatisfied that Defendants’ unlawful customs, policies, practices, \nrules, regulations, acts and omissions complained of herein no \nlonger exist and will not recur;  \nG.

Collins, Circuit Judges. \n \nOpinion by Judge Collins \n   \n\n(2 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 2 of 27\n2  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nSUMMARY* \n \n \nTitle IX / Class Certification \n \n  The panel reversed the district court’s order denying \nfemale student athletes’ motion for class certification in their \naction seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to redress \nalleged violations of Title IX in the athletic programs at a \npublic high school in Hawaii. \n \n  Plaintiffs brought Title IX claims for failure to provide \nequal treatment and benefits, failure to provide male and \nfemale  students  with  equivalent  opportunities  for \nparticipation  in  athletics,  and  retaliation  against  female \nathletes when issues of Title IX compliance were brought to \nthe attention of high school administrators.  The district court \ndenied  plaintiffs’  motion  for  class  certification  on  the \ngrounds that, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), they failed to meet \nthe requirement of  numerosity, and  as to the retaliation \nclaim, commonality and typicality were lacking.  The district \ncourt concluded that because plaintiffs failed to meet one or \nmore requirements of Rule 23(a), it was not necessary to \naddress the additional requirements of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) and \n(b)(2). \n \n  As  to  numerosity,  the  panel  held  that  Rule  23(a)(1) \nrequires a party seeking class certification to show that “the \nclass  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.”  The panel applied the standard set forth in \nJordan v. County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. \n1982), vacated, 459 U.S. 810 (1982), on remand, 713 F.2d \n \n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It \nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\n(3 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 3 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  3 \n \n503 (9th Cir. 1983), modified, 726 F.2d 1366 (9th Cir. 1984), \nwhich requires consideration of the size of the class as well \nas  potentially  countervailing  factors  including  the \ngeographical  diversity  of  class  members,  the  ability  of \nindividual  claimants  to  institute  separate  suits,  whether \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is sought, and the ability to \nidentify and locate class members.  The panel concluded that \nthe district court failed to give appropriate weight to the very \nlarge size of the proposed class, which well exceeded 300 \npersons,  and  there  were  no  countervailing  case-specific \nconsiderations indicating that, despite the large class size, \njoinder of all class members was nonetheless practicable.  \nThe panel held that the district court also erred in failing \nadequately to consider the fact that the class, as defined, \nincluded “future” female student athletes at the high school.  \nThe panel therefore reversed the denial of class certification \nas to plaintiffs’ first and second claims and remanded with \ninstructions to address whether plaintiffs also satisfied one \nor more of the criteria in Rule 23(b). \n \n  The panel held that as to plaintiffs’ third cause of action \nfor  unlawful  retaliation,  the  district  court  erred  in  also \ndenying  class  certification  on  the  further  ground  that \nplaintiffs failed to show commonality and typicality because \nthis claim was centered on the high school water polo team, \nrather than on female student athletes as a whole.  The panel \nconcluded that the district court failed adequately to consider \nplaintiffs’  contention  that  defendants’  alleged  retaliatory \nactions had a classwide effect.  In addition, the district court \nfailed to properly consider the legal principles that govern a \nretaliation claim of this nature under Title IX and require \nconsideration of whether plaintiffs fall within the zone of \ninterests that Title IX protects. \n \n\n(4 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 4 of 27\n4  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \n  The panel held that the district court abused its discretion \nin concluding that plaintiffs did not meet the requirements of \nRule 23(a).  The panel therefore reversed the district court’s \norder denying class certification and remanded for it to \nconsider whether plaintiffs satisfied Rule 23(b). \n \n \nCOUNSEL \n \nElizabeth Kristen (argued) and Kim Turner, Legal Aid at \nWork,  San  Francisco,  California;  Mateo  Caballero  and \nJongwook Kim, ACLU of Hawaii Foundation, Honolulu, \nHawaii; Harrison J.

B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  5 \n \nOPINION \nCOLLINS, Circuit Judge: \nSection 901(a) of Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 provides that, subject to certain exceptions, “[n]o \nperson in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any education program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a).  Although Title IX contains no express language \ncreating a private cause of action, the Supreme Court has \nlong held that the statute is enforceable through a judicially \nrecognized implied private right of action.  See Franklin v. \nGwinnett Cnty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 65 (1992) (citing \nCannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979)).  \nInvoking that right of action here, female student athletes at \nHawaii’s largest public high school brought this putative \nclass  action  seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to \nredress multiple alleged violations of Title IX, including \nsystematic  discriminatory  deficiencies  in  their  school’s \nathletic programs.  The district court subsequently denied \nPlaintiffs’  motion  for  class  certification,  holding  that \nPlaintiffs had failed to satisfy the requirements of Federal \nRule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a).    We  authorized  this \ninterlocutory appeal under Rule 23(f), and we reverse. \nI \nA \nPlaintiffs A.B., her younger sister A.M.B., T.T., and A.P. \nare or were female student athletes at James Campbell High \n\n(6 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 6 of 27\n6  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nSchool (“Campbell”) in Ewa Beach on the island of Oahu.1  \nAt the time A.B. and T.T. moved for class certification in \nMay 2019, all four were members of the Campbell girls’ \nvarsity water polo team; A.B. and T.T. were also members \nof the girls’ varsity swimming team; and A.P. was also a \nmember of the girls’ varsity soccer team.2  A.M.B. later \nstated that she also planned to join the swimming team.  \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  they  and  other  female  students  at \nCampbell “experience grossly unequal treatment, benefits, \nand opportunities in relation to male athletes,” resulting in \nmultiple violations of Title IX.  As a result, A.B. and T.T. \nfiled this suit in December 2018 against Defendant Hawaii \nState Department of Education (“the Department”), which is \nthe  agency  that  manages  Campbell’s  operations,  and \nDefendant Oahu Interscholastic Association, which is an \nunincorporated entity that administers high school athletic \nprograms for public high schools on Oahu.  In the operative \nsecond amended complaint, Plaintiffs assert three separate \ncauses  of  action  available  under  Title  IX  and  its \nimplementing  regulations:  “(1) unequal  treatment  and \nbenefits  in  athletic  programs;  (2) unequal  participation \nopportunities in athletic programs; and (3) retaliation.”  See \n \n1 A.B. and T.T. were seniors at the time this case was originally filed \nin late 2018 and graduated before the district court ruled on the class \ncertification motion.  A.P. was a senior at the time this case was argued \nand has presumably graduated.  A.M.B. was a junior at the time of oral \nargument and is presumably a current senior.  No party has suggested \nthat this case is moot, and we perceive no basis for concluding that it is. \n2 After the class certification motion was filed, but before the district \ncourt denied it, amended complaints were filed adding A.M.B. and A.P. \nas additional plaintiffs.  All four Plaintiffs submitted declarations in \nsupport of the class certification motion. \n\n(7 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 7 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  7 \n \nOllier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 768 F.3d 843, \n851 (9th Cir. 2014). \nIn  their  first  cause  of  action,  Plaintiffs  allege  that \nDefendants violated § 901(a) by failing to provide equal \ntreatment  and  benefits.    We  have  held  that  § 901(a)’s \nprohibition on discriminatory denial of educational benefits, \nas  construed  in  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education’s \nimplementing  regulation  governing  school  athletic \nprograms, “require[s] equivalence in the availability, quality \nand kinds of . . . athletic benefits and opportunities provided \n[to] male and female athletes.”  Mansourian v. Regents of \nUniv. of Cal., 602 F.3d 957, 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (citing 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)–\n(10));  see  also  20  U.S.C.  § 1682  (authorizing  federal \nagencies  extending  federal  financial  assistance  to  issue \nappropriate  “rules,  regulations,  or  orders  of  general \napplicability”).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated \nthis  requirement  by  “failing  to  provide  female  student \nathletes from Campbell with treatment and benefits that are \ncomparable to the treatment and benefits provided to male \nstudent athletes.” \nIn support of this claim, Plaintiffs allege, for example, \nthat “male athletes at Campbell have exclusive access” to a \nvery large “stand-alone athletic locker room facility that is \nlocated near the athletic fields,” while “female athletes at \nCampbell have no standalone athletic locker room facility, \nwhether located near the athletic fields or elsewhere on \ncampus.”  Plaintiffs allege that, as a result, “female athletes, \nincluding Plaintiffs, must carry their athletic gear around \nwith them all day and have resorted to changing in teachers’ \nclosets, in the bathroom of the nearest Burger King, and even \non the practice field, potentially in full view of bystanders.”  \nPlaintiffs also allege that, in contrast to Campbell’s well-\n\n(8 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 8 of 27\n8  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nequipped boys’ sports programs, the girls’ water polo and \nsoccer programs have not been given adequate equipment, \ngear, and training facilities.  Indeed, the complaint alleges \nthat on multiple occasions, the girls’ water polo team lacked \nany access to a pool for practice, leaving them “no choice \nbut to hold dry-land training sessions and open-ocean swim \npractices.”  Plaintiffs also allege that coaches for the girls’ \nteams at Campbell are generally paid less than coaches for \nthe boys’ teams, and that some assistant coaches for the \ngirls’ teams are not paid at all. \nPlaintiffs’ second cause of action alleges that Defendants \nviolated § 901(a) by failing to provide male and female \nstudents with equivalent opportunities for “participation” in \nathletics.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Relying again on the \nregulations implementing § 901(a)’s requirements, we have \nheld that this obligation to provide equivalent participation \nopportunities  requires  consideration  of  “whether  ‘the \nselection  of  sports  and  levels  of  competition  effectively \naccommodate the interests and abilities of members of both \nsexes.’”  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 964 (quoting 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.41(c)(1)).  In addressing that question, our precedent \napplies a “three-part test,” under which a school has “three \noptions”  for  satisfying  this  obligation:  “(1) showing \nsubstantial  proportionality  (the  number  of  women  in \n[interscholastic]  athletics  is  proportionate  to  their \nenrollment); (2) proving that the institution has a ‘history \nand  continuing  practice  of  program  expansion’  for  the \nunderrepresented sex (in this case, women); or (3) where the \n[school]  cannot  satisfy  either  of  the  first  two  options, \nestablishing  that  it  nonetheless  ‘fully  and  effectively \naccommodate[s]’  the  interests  of  women.”    Id.  at  965 \n(citation omitted); see also Ollier, 768 F.3d at 855 (applying \nthis three-part test to high schools).  Plaintiffs’ complaint \nalleges  that  Defendants’  management  of  athletics  at \n\n(9 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 9 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  9 \n \nCampbell fails to satisfy any of these alternative prongs.  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs allege that there is 6.6% “participation \ngap” at Campbell between “female athletic participation” \n(which  is  41.6%  of  the  total  number  of  athletic  “roster \nspots”) and “female student body enrollment” (which is \n48.2% of the student body). \nPlaintiffs’ third cause of action is asserted only against \nthe  Department  and  alleges  that  it  violated  § 901(a)  by \nretaliating against female athletes at Campbell when A.B., \nT.T., and others brought issues of Title IX compliance to the \nattention  of  Campbell  administrators.    See  Jackson  v. \nBirmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 178 (2005) (holding \nthat “the text of Title IX prohibits a funding recipient from \nretaliating  against  a  person  who  speaks  out  against  sex \ndiscrimination,  because  such  retaliation  is  intentional \n‘discrimination’  ‘on  the  basis  of  sex’”).    Specifically, \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  school  administrators  retaliated  by \nthreatening to cancel Campbell’s girls’ water polo program \nand by making the water polo team needlessly resubmit \nprogram  paperwork.    Plaintiffs  further  allege  that  these \nretaliatory  actions  created  a  “chilling  effect  among \nCampbell’s  female  athletes  regarding  identifying  and \ncomplaining about other gender inequities in athletics” to the \nDepartment. \nPlaintiffs’  complaint  seeks  only  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief against Defendants, as well as attorneys’ \nfees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nB \nRelying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B) \nand (b)(2), Plaintiffs moved to certify a class of “all present \nand future Campbell female students and potential students \nwho  participate,  seek  to  participate,  and/or  are  or  were \n\n(10 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 10 of 27\n10  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \ndeterred from participating in athletics at Campbell.”  After \nconsidering the evidence and arguments of both sides, the \ndistrict court denied the motion. \nThe  district  court  held  that,  as  to  all  three  claims, \nPlaintiffs had failed to make the required threshold showing \nthat the class was “so numerous that joinder of all members \nis impracticable.”  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).  The court \nnoted that the evidence supplied by Defendants indicated \nthat “there were 366 Campbell female student-athletes in the \n2018–19 school year.”  Nonetheless, because the “proposed \nclass members are limited to the female student population \nfrom a single high school” and are thus “geographically tied \nto one area of Hawai`i, and identifiable through school and \nathletic records,” the court concluded that joinder of all class \nmembers was not impracticable.  Although school records \ncould not similarly identify future or potential female student \nathletes  at  Campbell,  the  district  court  held  that  those \n“subgroups”  were  irrelevant  to  the  numerosity  analysis \nbecause neither was “reasonably identifiable.” \nTurning to the other elements of Rule 23(a), the district \ncourt held that Plaintiffs’ first and second causes of action—\nwhich  alleged  denial  of  equal  treatment  and  equal \nparticipation  opportunities—raised  several  common \nquestions of law or fact that were “capable of classwide \nresolution,” see Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 350 (2011) (construing FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(2)), and \nthat the individual Plaintiffs’ claims under these two causes \nof  action  were  “typical”  of  the  claims  of  the  class.  \nSpecifically,  Plaintiffs  alleged  a  number  of  discrete \ndiscriminatory actions with inherently systemic effects on \nfemale student athletes, and the resulting “[u]nequal access, \ntreatment, and benefits of athletic programs is a common \ninjury among the named Plaintiffs and proposed class.” \n\n(11 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 11 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  11 \n \nBy contrast, the district court held that commonality and \ntypicality were lacking with respect to Plaintiffs’ third cause \nof  action,  which  alleges  retaliation.    Commonality  was \nabsent, the court concluded, because the retaliation claim \narose from a dispute between “Campbell administrators[] \nand the water polo team and their parents,” and Plaintiffs had \nnot  “allege[d]  any  instances  of  retaliation  against  any \nathletes other than members of the water polo team.”  For \nsimilar reasons, the district court concluded that the alleged \nretaliatory actions of the Department were “unique to the \nnamed Plaintiffs” and were therefore “not typical of the \nproposed class.” \nLastly, the district court found that Plaintiffs would be \nadequate representatives of the class, without distinguishing \namong the three claims. \nHaving concluded that Plaintiffs had failed to satisfy one \nor more requirements of Rule 23(a), the court stated that it \nwas “not necessary to address” the additional requirements \nof Rule 23(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2). \nPlaintiffs timely petitioned for leave to appeal pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), and a panel of this \ncourt granted Plaintiffs’ petition.  This court has jurisdiction \nover Plaintiffs’ appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(e). \nII \nTo obtain certification of a plaintiff class under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23, a plaintiff must satisfy both the \nfour  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)—“numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequate representation”—and \n“one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b).”  Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 345, 349.  These are not “mere pleading” \nrequirements,  and  a  plaintiff  must  “affirmatively \n\n(12 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 12 of 27\n12  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \ndemonstrate . . . compliance with the Rule—that is, he [or \nshe]  must  be  prepared  to  prove  that  there  are  in  fact \nsufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or \nfact, etc.”  Id. at 350.  Here, the district court never reached \nthe issue of whether Plaintiffs had shown one of the elements \nof Rule 23(b),3 because it concluded that (1) Rule 23(a)’s \nrequired  threshold  showing  of  numerosity  had  not  been \nmade as to any of Plaintiffs’ claims; and (2) Rule 23(a)’s \nrequirements of commonality and typicality had not been \nshown as to Plaintiffs’ retaliation claim.  We review these \ndeterminations for abuse of discretion, keeping in mind that \na “district court abuses its discretion where it commits an \nerror of law, relies on an improper factor, omits a substantial \nfactor, or engages in a clear error of judgment in weighing \nthe correct mix of factors.”  Senne v. Kansas City Royals \nBaseball Corp., 934 F.3d 918, 926 (9th Cir. 2019).  Applying \nthose standards, we reverse. \nIII \nA \nRule 23(a)(1) requires a party seeking class certification \nto show that “the class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).  As \nthe  Supreme  Court  has  explained,  this  “numerosity \n \n3 In moving for class certification, Plaintiffs argued that the requisite \nelement of Rule 23(b) was satisfied either (1) because Defendants had \n“acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \nthat  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole,” see FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2); \nor (2) because separate actions by individual class members could, “as a \npractical matter, . . . be dispositive of the interests of the other members” \nor could “substantially impair or impede [the other members’] ability to \nprotect their interests,” see FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(1)(B). \n\n(13 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 13 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  13 \n \nrequirement requires examination of the specific facts of \neach case and imposes no absolute limitations.”  General \nTel. Co. of the NW., Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).  \nWhile thus eschewing any bright-line rules, the Court did go \non to state that a class with only 15 members “would be too \nsmall to meet the numerosity requirement.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs contend that we should apply the standards for \nevaluating numerosity set forth in Jordan v. County of Los \nAngeles, 669 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated, 459 U.S. \n810  (1982),  on  remand,  713  F.2d  503  (9th  Cir.  1983), \nmodified,  726  F.2d  1366  (9th  Cir.  1984).    Defendants, \nhowever, contend that Jordan is no longer good law and in \nany  event  is  distinguishable.    Because  the  parties  have \npointed us to no other decision in which we have elaborated \non the substantive standards for evaluating numerosity—and \nour own research has likewise revealed none—we begin by \nclosely examining our decisions in Jordan. \nIn that case, the plaintiff’s class action complaint alleged \nthat the defendant county’s consideration of “three types of \ncriminal  record,  i.e.,  juvenile  record,  arrest  record,  and \nmarijuana  conviction  record”  constituted  unlawful  race \ndiscrimination against Blacks in violation of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., as well \nas a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1981.  See 669 F.2d at 1314–15.  The district court denied \nplaintiff’s motion to certify separate classes as to each type \nof criminal record, concluding that all four requirements of \nRule 23(a), including numerosity, had not been satisfied.  Id. \nat 1318–23.  We initially reversed, holding that all four \nrequirements had been met.  Id. \nIn addressing numerosity, Jordan indicated that a court \nmust consider what the evidence shows concerning “the \nabsolute number of class members.”  669 F.2d at 1319.  \n\n(14 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 14 of 27\n14  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nAlthough the size of the class “is not the sole determining \nfactor,” we stated that, “where a class is large in numbers, \njoinder will usually be impracticable.”  Id.  By contrast, \nwhere the size of the class is more modest, “the number of \nclass members does not weigh as heavily” in the analysis, \nand  “other  factors”  bearing  upon  the  feasibility  and \nconvenience of joinder may assume more significance.  Id.  \nThese  potentially  countervailing  factors  include  “the \ngeographical  diversity  of  class  members,  the  ability  of \nindividual claimants to institute separate suits, and whether \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is sought,” as well as the \nability to identify and locate class members.  Id. at 1319–20. \nApplying these standards, we held that, “[a]lthough we \nwould be inclined to find the numerosity requirement in the \npresent case satisfied solely on the basis of the number of \nascertained class members, i.e., 39, 64, and 71, we need not \ndo so since the presence of other indicia of impracticability \npersuade us that the requirement has been met.”  Id. at 1319.  \nSpecifically, we noted that “the relatively small size of each \nclass  member’s  claim  and  the  probability  that  the  class \nmembers may be difficult to locate combine to make it \nimpracticable for individual class members to join in the \nlawsuit.”  Id. at 1319–20.  We also observed that each class \nincluded “unnamed and unknown future black applicants” \nand that the “joinder of unknown individuals is inherently \nimpracticable.”  Id. at 1320.  Based on these reasons, we held \nthat “the district court erred in denying class certification for \nfailure to satisfy the numerosity requirement.”  Id. \nWe then proceeded to find that the plaintiff had also \nsatisfied  the  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a).  Id. at 1320–23.  However, our \nanalysis of the commonality and typicality factors expressly \nrelied on the Fifth Circuit’s so-called “across-the-board” \n\n(15 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 15 of 27\n  A.

HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  15 \n \nrule, under which a plaintiff challenging one discriminatory \npractice was permitted to represent employees challenging \ndifferent practices if all employees suffered similar injuries.  \nId. at 1320, 1322 (citing Johnson v. Georgia Hwy. Express, \n417 F.2d 1122, 1124 (5th Cir. 1969)).  Shortly thereafter, the \nSupreme  Court  explicitly  rejected  that  “across-the-board \nrule,” concluding that it improperly relied on a presumption \nthat  a  discriminatory  employment  decision  against  the \nnamed plaintiff reflects a pervasive discriminatory policy \nthat is then reflected in all of the defendant’s various hiring \npractices.    See  General  Tel.  Co.  of  the  SW.  v.  Falcon, \n457 U.S.  147,  157–58  (1982).    The  Court  consequently \nvacated our decision in Jordan for reconsideration in light of \nFalcon.  See Jordan, 459 U.S. at 810. \nOn remand, we concluded that, in light of the Supreme \nCourt’s intervening abrogation of the across-the-board rule, \nas  well  as  our  “recomputation  of  the  actual  number  of \nrejected black applicants,” the “numerosity requirement of \nRule 23” had not been met.  See Jordan, 726 F.2d at 1367 \n(emphasis added), amending 713 F.2d at 504.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, however, we did not in any way suggest that \nour  original  decision’s  substantive  articulation  of  the \nnumerosity standards was erroneous.  Moreover, Falcon \ndoes not address the standards for numerosity at all, and it \ntherefore  provides  no  basis  for  declining  to  follow  our \nelaboration  of  the  numerosity  requirement  in  our  initial \ndecision in Jordan.  See Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, \n899–900 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc).  Accordingly, we will \napply Jordan’s framework in assessing numerosity here. \nB \nWe conclude that the district court’s numerosity analysis \nwas inconsistent with Jordan in two respects. \n\n(16 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 16 of 27\n16  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \n1 \nFirst, the district court failed to give appropriate weight \nto  the  very  large  size  of  the  proposed  class.    Plaintiffs \npresented uncontroverted evidence that in the 2016–2017, \n2017–2018, and 2018–2019 school years, the annual number \nof female student athletes at Campbell ranged between 366 \nand 434.  Thus, even considering only currently enrolled \nstudents,  the  evidence  amply  shows  that  a  reasonable \nestimate of the size of the class well exceeds 300 persons. \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to make any \nshowing that all current female student athletes have been \nsubjected to the alleged Title IX violations and are therefore \nclass members, but we think this argument overlooks both \nthe  substance  of  Plaintiffs’  claims  and  the  applicable \nstandards for liability under Title IX.  Some aspects of \nPlaintiffs’  first  cause  of  action,  which  alleges  unequal \ntreatment  and  benefits,  explicitly  rest  on  allegations  of \nsystemic discrimination (such as, for example, the complete \nlack of standalone athletic locker facilities) that, if proved, \nwould  necessarily  apply  to  all  current  female  student \nathletes.  See supra at 7–8.  As to the second cause of action \nfor unequal participation opportunities, the three-part test we \napply for evaluating such claims is framed in terms that \nexamine the school’s overall treatment of female athletic \nprograms versus male athletic programs.  See supra at 8.  \nAnd for reasons we explain further below, we conclude that \nPlaintiffs’  third  cause  of  action  for  retaliation  likewise \nproperly rests upon asserted classwide adverse impacts on \nfemale student athletes at Campbell.  See infra at 24–26.  It \nfollows  that  Plaintiffs  amply  showed  that  the  absolute \nnumber of class members as to each claim is well over 300 \npersons.    The  resulting  class  size  qualifies  as  “large  in \nnumbers” by any metric, and therefore, under Jordan, that \n\n(17 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 17 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  17 \n \nlarge class size weighs in favor of concluding that joinder of \nall of these persons is impracticable.  669 F.2d at 1319. \nOn this record, we find no countervailing case-specific \nconsiderations indicating that, despite the large class size, \njoinder of all class members is nonetheless practicable.  In \nconcluding that joinder of all class members was practicable \nhere, despite the potential size of the class, the district court \nemphasized that all of Campbell’s current female student \nathletes could be identified “through school and athletic \nrecords” and that all of them were local and within the \njurisdiction of the court.  But the standard under Rule 23(a) \nis not, as the district court seemed to think, whether joinder \nis a literal impossibility.  Rather, the question is whether \njoinder  of  all  class  members  is  “practicable”—i.e., \n“reasonably  capable  of  being  accomplished.”    See \nPracticable, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (11th  ed.  2019) \n(emphasis added); see also Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine \nEsts.,  Inc.,  329  F.2d  909,  913–14  (9th  Cir.  1964) \n(“‘[I]mpracticability’  does  not  mean  ‘impossibility,’  but \nonly the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members \nof the class.”); Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d \nCir. 1993) (“Impracticable does not mean impossible.”). \nHere, joinder of all class members is not “reasonably \ncapable of being accomplished” because it would impose \nvery substantial logistical burdens for little, if any, benefit.  \nWhere, as here, the class seeks only prospective injunctive \nand declaratory relief, the practical value of joining each of \nthe 300+ class members as a formal party is slim to non-\nexistent  and  is  plainly  outweighed  by  the  substantial \nlogistical burdens that would entail.  See Jordan, 669 F.2d \nat 1319 (noting that “whether injunctive or declaratory relief \nis sought” is relevant to assessing whether joinder of class \nmembers is impracticable); see also Harris, 329 F.2d at 913 \n\n(18 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 18 of 27\n18  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \n(stating that, in assessing impracticability, the court should \nconsider “the expense and burden[] to the parties and the \ncourt”). \n2 \nSecond,  the  district  court  also  failed  adequately  to \nconsider the fact that the class, as defined, included “future” \nCampbell female student athletes. \n“The inclusion of future class members in a class is not \nitself unusual or objectionable,” because “[w]hen the future \npersons  referenced  become  members  of  the  class,  their \nclaims  will  necessarily  be  ripe.”    Rodriguez  v.  Hayes, \n591 F.3d 1105, 1118 (9th Cir. 2010).  We have recognized \nthat when, as here, a class’s membership changes continually \nover time, that factor weighs in favor of concluding that \njoinder  of  all  members  is  impracticable.    See  Jordan, \n669 F.2d at 13204; see also J.D. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 1291, 1322 \n \n4 Plaintiffs construe Jordan as standing for the broader proposition \nthat any proposed class that includes future members automatically \nsatisfies  the  numerosity  requirement,  because  future  members  are \ninherently unidentifiable at the time of class certification and thereby \ncannot practicably be joined.  We do not read Jordan as establishing such \na sweeping proposition.  As an initial matter, Jordan’s assumption that \nthe plaintiff in that case could represent all “future” class members \nappears to have rested in part on its application of the Fifth Circuit’s \n“across-the-board” rule.  See 669 F.2d at 1320 (citing Jack v. American \nLinen Supply Co., 498 F.2d 122 (5th Cir. 1974)).  That aspect of the \ndecision therefore did not survive Falcon, which would also explain why \nwe did not mention future class members in our decision on remand in \nJordan.  See 713 F.2d at 504, as amended, 726 F.2d at 1366–67.  \nMoreover, as we explicitly recognized in Rodriguez, the inclusion of \nfuture class members in a class definition is subject to the ripeness \nrequirement of Article III, see 591 F.3d at 1118, and so the relevant \nnumerosity inquiry concerning future class members is whether it would \nbe practicable to join such future members as their claims become ripe. \n\n(19 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 19 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  19 \n \n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (noting that this factor weighs in favor of \nimpracticability of joinder even if current class members are \nrelatively fewer in number); cf. Smith v. Swormstedt, 57 U.S. \n288, 303 (1854) (indicating, in a pre-Rules equitable suit \nbrought by members and preachers of one branch of a church \nagainst those in the other branch, that joinder of all members \nwould  be  impracticable  due  to  the  large  and  changing \nmembership of the churches); see generally 7A CHARLES \nALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, & MARY KAY KANE, \nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1762 at 227–29 (4th \ned. 2021). \nThe district court declined to consider this factor because \nit concluded that future class members were not “reasonably \nidentifiable,”  and  the  court  therefore  could  not  make  a \n“reasonable approximation” of the number of such members.  \nThis reasoning misconstrues the significance of this factor.  \nThe fact that it may not be possible to identify future class \nmembers at the time of class certification does not mean that \nthis factor therefore drops out of the analysis and may be set \naside.  On the contrary, as we held in Jordan, the fact that \nthe membership of a class changes over time makes joinder \nof every class member all the more impracticable.  See \n669 F.2d at 1320.  This case well illustrates the point.  Every \nyear, as new freshmen matriculate into Campbell and as \nseniors graduate, the membership of potentially 25% of the \nstudent body may be expected to turn over.  Given the purely \nequitable nature of the claims, there is little if any benefit to \ncontinually joining, or potentially dismissing, large numbers \nof  additional  class  members.    That  makes  the \nimpracticability analysis all the more lopsided in favor of \nfinding numerosity. \nFor  similar  reasons,  the  district  court  abused  its \ndiscretion in concluding that a “reasonable approximation” \n\n(20 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 20 of 27\n20  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nof future class members could not be made in this case.  \nGiven the three years of data in the record concerning the \napproximate  number  of  current  class  members  for  each \nschool year from 2016–2019, it is not difficult to reasonably \nestimate the extent to which class membership might be \nexpected to change each year.  For present purposes, all that \nis needed is a sufficient estimate of the number of future \nclass members to allow the court to assess what weight to \ngive to this factor when considered together with the other \npertinent considerations.  Here, as we have explained, the \nestimate of the current membership is well over 300 persons \nand already weighs heavily in favor of finding numerosity.  \nThe fact that additional persons, totaling as many as 25% of \nthat number, would also need to be formally joined each year \ntips the balance even more strongly in favor of concluding \nthat the “class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.”  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1).5 \nC \nWe therefore conclude that the district court erred in \nholding  that  Plaintiffs  had  not  satisfied  the  numerosity \nrequirement of Rule 23(a).  And because that was the sole \nground on which the court concluded that the requirements \nof Rule 23(a) had not been met as to Plaintiffs’ first and \nsecond  causes  of  action,  we  reverse  the  denial  of  class \ncertification as to those claims and remand with instructions \nto address whether Plaintiffs also satisfied one or more of the \ncriteria in Rule 23(b). \n \n5 In view of this analysis, we find it unnecessary to address the \nparties’ arguments as to whether numerosity is further established by the \npresence, in the class definition, of female student non-athletes who were \ndeterred from participation in sports by Defendants’ alleged Title IX \nviolations. \n\n(21 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 21 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  21 \n \nIV \nAs  to  Plaintiffs’  third  cause  of  action  for  unlawful \nretaliation, the district court also denied class certification on \nthe  further  ground  that  Plaintiffs  had  failed  to  show \ncommonality  and  typicality.    This  conclusion  was  also \nflawed. \nThe commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) requires \nplaintiffs seeking class certification to show that their claims \n“depend upon a common contention” that “is capable of \nclasswide resolution—which means that determination of its \ntruth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, \n564 U.S. at 350.  To establish typicality, as required by Rule \n23(a)(3), plaintiffs must show that “the claims or defenses of \nthe  representative  parties  are  typical  of  the  claims  or \ndefenses of the class.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(3).  “The test of \ntypicality  ‘is  whether  other  members  have  the  same  or \nsimilar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which \nis not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class \nmembers have been injured by the same course of conduct.’”  \nHanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. \n1992)  (citation  omitted).    Because  the  considerations \nunderlying the two requirements overlap considerably, the \nSupreme  Court  has  noted  that  “[t]he  commonality  and \ntypicality  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)  tend  to  merge.”  \nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 157 n.13. \nThe district court concluded that these two requirements \nwere  not  satisfied  here,  because  in  its  view  Plaintiffs’ \nretaliation claim is centered on the water polo team rather \nthan on female student athletes as a whole.  As the district \ncourt explained, the Department’s retaliatory actions arose \nfrom “a dispute between Defendants, specifically limited to \nCampbell administrators, and the water polo team and their \n\n(22 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 22 of 27\n22  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nparents,” and the only claimed instances of actual retaliation \nwere  against  “members  of  the  water  polo  team.”    This \nreasoning misapprehends Plaintiffs’ retaliation claim and the \nlaw governing it. \nAlthough the Department’s alleged retaliatory actions \nwere immediately directed at the water polo team, whose \nmembers  and  their  parents  had  made  complaints  about \nunequal treatment, the district court failed adequately to \nconsider  Plaintiffs’  contention  that  those  actions  had  a \nclasswide  effect.    Specifically,  Plaintiffs  assert  that  the \nexample that the Department made of the girls’ water polo \nteam had the effect of broadly dissuading Campbell’s female \nstudent  athletes  from  “raising  the  issue  of  sex \ndiscrimination”  out  of  fear  that  the  Department  would \nlikewise  retaliate  against  them.    Indeed,  a  declaration \nsubmitted  by  one  of  the  Plaintiffs’  parents  specifically \naverred  that  other  students  and  parents  had  “expressed \ninterest in joining the lawsuit, but were scared about the \nrepercussions from [the Department] if they did so.”  This \nparent explained that, for example, one student who was a \n“star athlete” and who hoped to win college scholarships, \nwas  too  afraid  “to  jeopardize  her  relationship  with  the \nschool.” \nIn addition to overlooking the broader theory of unlawful \nretaliation that Plaintiffs raised here, the district court failed \nto  properly  consider  the  legal  principles  that  govern  a \nretaliation claim of this nature under Title IX.  On this point, \nwe find our prior decision in Ollier to be instructive, and so \nwe address that decision in some detail. \nIn  Ollier,  complaints  concerning  a  high  school’s \ncompliance with Title IX were made by the named plaintiffs’ \nparents  and  the  girls’  softball  coach,  Chris  Martinez.  \n768 F.3d at 853, 866–67.  In response, the school fired \n\n(23 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 23 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  23 \n \nCoach  Martinez  and  replaced  him  with  a  “far  less \nexperienced coach,” eliminated the girls’ softball team’s \nassistant coaches, and took a variety of other actions that \n“disrupted” the girls’ softball program.  Id. at 869.  On \nappeal,  the  defendants  made  a  series  of  arguments  that \nresemble those made by the Department here.  Specifically, \nthe  Ollier  defendants  argued  that  the  named  plaintiffs \n“lack[ed] standing to enjoin the retaliatory action allegedly \ntaken  against  Coach  Martinez”;  that  they  also  “lack[ed] \nstanding because it was not they who made the Title IX \ncomplaints”;  and  that  classwide  relief  was  unwarranted \nbecause “only some members of the plaintiff[s’] class . . . \ncan urge they engaged in protected activity.”  Id. at 865–66, \n868.  We rejected all of these contentions, concluding that \nthey rested on too restrictive a view of Title IX’s cause of \naction for retaliation.  Id. at 866–69. \nWe held that the named plaintiffs clearly asserted a \nsufficient injury-in-fact to satisfy Article III, because their \n“prospects  for  competing  were  hampered”  when  the \ndefendants “impermissibly retaliated against them by firing \nCoach Martinez.”  Id. at 865 (emphasis in original).  We also \nrecognized, however, that what the defendants characterized \nas “standing” arguments actually rested primarily on the \ngeneral prudential rule against asserting the rights of third \nparties.  Id. (citing Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 \n(1975));  cf.  Lexmark  Int’l,  Inc.  v.  Static  Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 126 (2014) (noting that “the \ngeneral prohibition on a litigant’s raising another person’s \nlegal rights” is “not derived from Article III,” but reflects \nwhat has inexactly been called the “‘prudential’ branch of \nstanding”).  Addressing the question that way, we held that \nthe named plaintiffs could assert a Title IX retaliation claim \nbased on retaliatory actions that were directed at another \nperson  (Coach  Martinez)  and  that  were  triggered  by \n\n(24 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 24 of 27\n24  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \ncomplaints made by others (Coach Martinez and various \nparents).  Ollier, 768 F.3d at 866–67. \nIn reaching that conclusion, we noted that the Supreme \nCourt had addressed a somewhat similar individual third-\nparty retaliation claim under Title VII in Thompson v. North \nAmerican Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 177–78 (2011).  See \nOllier, 768 F.3d at 866.  There, both Thompson and his \nfiancée worked in the same company, and the allegation was \nthat Thompson was fired in retaliation for complaints about \nsex discrimination made by his fiancée.  Thompson, 562 U.S. \nat 172.  The Court held that, because Thompson was within \nthe “zone of interests” protected by Title VII, he had a cause \nof action for retaliation even though his fiancée was the one \nwho had engaged in the protected activity that led to the \nretaliation.  Id. at 177–78.  We concluded in Ollier that this \nsame zone-of-interest analysis applies to Title IX, and we \ntherefore considered whether the named plaintiffs in that \ncase were “within the ‘zone of interests’ that Title IX’s \nimplicit antiretaliation provisions seek to protect.”  Ollier, \n768 F.3d at 866; see also Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 127 & n.3 \n(suggesting that, in many cases, “third-party standing” is \nreally an issue of whether the party has a cause of action \nunder a statute, which in turn depends in part on the zone-of-\ninterests test).  Because those named plaintiffs were students \nwho had suffered a diminished athletic experience due to \nretaliation, we concluded that they easily fell within Title \nIX’s zone of interests.  Ollier, 768 F.3d at 866.  They \ntherefore had a cause of action under Title IX to seek redress \nfor those injuries, despite the fact that the actual Title IX \ncomplaints that led to the retaliation were “made by their \nparents and Coach Martinez.”  Id. at 866–67. \nWe similarly held that classwide injunctive relief was \nproperly awarded in Ollier, despite the fact that many of the \n\n(25 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 25 of 27\n  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC.  25 \n \nclass members had not even been “members of the softball \nteam at the time of retaliation.”  Id. at 868.  In so holding, we \nreiterated the breadth of Title IX’s zone of interests, see id. \n(citing Thompson, 562 U.S. at 178), and asserted that we had \napproved similarly broadly-defined classes that included “all \ncurrent and future” female students, id. (citation omitted).  \nBecause the class members in Ollier had been affected by \nthe retaliation and were within the zone of interests protected \nby Title IX’s prohibition on retaliation, the district court \nproperly extended its grant of injunctive relief “so as to \nvindicate the rights of former and future students.”  Id. \nAlthough Ollier did not directly address the issue of class \ncertification, see id. at 854 n.4, it is clear that the district \ncourt’s  application  of  Rule  23(a)’s  requirements  to \nPlaintiffs’ retaliation claim in this case cannot be reconciled \nwith Ollier’s analysis of the law governing such claims.  \nHere, as in Ollier, the specific Title IX complaints that led to \nthe retaliation were made only by a particular subset of \npeople (here, particular students and parents associated with \nthe water polo team).  But the concerns those persons raised \nswept more broadly to include Campbell’s treatment of girls’ \nathletics generally, and Plaintiffs have likewise presented \nevidence that the resulting retaliation had a deterrent effect \non female students more generally.  See supra at 22.  Thus, \nunder  Ollier’s  reasoning,  those  other  putative  class \nmembers—even those not on the water polo team—would \nfall within Title IX’s zone of interests and would have a \ncause of action for equitable relief against the Department’s \nretaliatory actions.  See 768 F.3d at 866–67.  And, as in \nOllier, the fact that many of the class members were not the \ndirect targets of the alleged retaliation would not necessarily \nbe a bar to classwide relief.  Id. at 868. \n\n(26 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 26 of 27\n26  A. B. V. HAWAII STATE DEP’T OF EDUC. \n \nIt follows from these conclusions that the district court \nabused  its  discretion  in  holding  that  Plaintiffs  had  not \nestablished commonality and typicality as to their retaliation \nclaim.  Given that the retaliation claims of both the named \nPlaintiffs  and  the  class  members  would  rest  on  the \nunderlying  motivation  for  the  Department’s  alleged \nretaliatory  actions  in  response  to  receiving  Title  IX \ncomplaints, that issue of retaliatory motive raises a common \nquestion whose answer will “resolve an issue that is central \nto the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 350.  That is sufficient to satisfy Rule \n23(a)(2). \nFor similar reasons, the district court erred in concluding, \nin effect, that the direct victims of unlawful retaliation have \nclaims that are atypical of the claims of the indirect victims.  \nPlaintiffs’ retaliation claim is not premised solely on the \ninjury of threatening to cancel Campbell’s girls’ water polo \nprogram and make the water polo team needlessly resubmit \nprogram paperwork.  Instead, it is also premised on the \n“chilling effect” felt by female athletes throughout the high \nschool.  And where, as claimed here, the persons who raised \nbroader concerns about Title IX compliance were met with \na retaliatory response that likewise impacted female student \nathletes  generally,  the  indirect  victims’  claims  depend \ncritically upon the success of the direct victims’ claims.  As \na result, there is little prospect that the named plaintiffs’ \nclaims could be said to be burdened with defenses or issues \nunique to them and distinct from the other class members.  \nSee Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508.  Plaintiffs thus established \ntypicality under Rule 23(a)(3). \n*          *          * \nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court abused its \ndiscretion  in  concluding  that  Plaintiffs  had  not  met  the \n\n(27 of 31)\nCase: 20-15570, 04/04/2022, ID: 12411363, DktEntry: 46-1, Page 27 of 27\n  A.
