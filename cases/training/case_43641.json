In support, \n55  \nPlaintiffs allege the following: \n66  \nNATURE OF THE CASE \n77  \n1.  This  is  an  action  brought  under  the  U.S.  Constitution  to  safeguard  the \n88  \nfundamental rights of hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, including the right to vote and \n99  \nthe state-protected right to vote early by mail, which are subject to due process protections. \n1100  \n“No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of \n1111  \nthose who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even \n1122  \nthe most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 \n1133  \nU.S. 1, 17 (1964). In this action, Plaintiffs challenge Arizona’s latest effort to undermine \n1144  \nthat most precious right: the recently enacted H.B. 2492, which severely burdens the right \n1155   to vote and, in many cases, will deny that right entirely, disenfranchising eligible, lawful \n1166   voters in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n1177   2.  Arizona has a long and complex history of applying different registration and \n1188   voting requirements to different voters, which has caused portions of its law to be held in \nviolation of federal law and has required the State to enter into an ongoing consent decree. \n1199  \nSee Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 15 (2013); Consent Decree \n2200  \nat  7-16,  LULAC  v.  Reagan,  No.  2:17-cv-04102-DGC  (June  18,  2018),  ECF  No.  37 \n2211  \n(“Consent Decree”). The result is a byzantine system in which Arizona has three classes of \n2222  \nvoters: (1) those who registered pre-2005 and did not have to show documentary proof of \n2233  \ncitizenship (because Arizona did not yet require it), who can vote in all elections; (2) those \n2244  \nwho  registered  post-2005  using  the  federal  form  required  by  the  National  Voter \n2255  \nRegistration Act (“NVRA”) (the “Federal Form”) and did not show documentary proof of \n2266  \ncitizenship, who can vote only in federal elections; and (3) those who registered post-2005 \n2277  \nand showed adequate proof of citizenship, who can vote in all elections. All of these voters \n2288  \nare entitled to vote in elections for which they are qualified by mail, a right which Arizona \n  \n-1- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 4 of 24\n \n11   has provided to all voters for any reason since 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. Further, under \n22   the ongoing consent decree, the state must (1) treat all registrants the same regardless of \n33   whether they use the state form or Federal Form, registering all voters for federal elections \n44   regardless of provided evidence of citizenship; and (2) check the motor vehicles database \nfor citizenship documentation before limiting voters to federal-only elections. See Consent \n55  \nDecree at 7-16. \n66  \n3.  H.B. 2492 (the “Proof of Citizenship Restriction”), which was signed into \n77  \nlaw on March 30, 2022, adds another confusing, discriminatory, and unconstitutional \n88  \nimpediment to this morass. Among other things, the Restriction will require new registrants \n99  \nusing the Federal Form to provide additional documentation if they want to vote in \n1100  \npresidential  elections  or  vote  early  by  mail  for  any  office,  prohibit  those  currently \n1111  \nregistered using the Federal Form who registered without proof of citizenship from voting \n1122  \nby mail or in presidential elections, and require long-registered Arizonans who never had \n1133  \nto provide proof of citizenship—estimated to be close to 200,000 voters1—to locate and \n1144   present additional documentation to vote in presidential elections.2 The law provides no \n1155   details concerning how long-registered voters will be notified that they must provide new \n1166   documents, or how they will be given an opportunity to do so, and also requires the \n1177   Attorney General to investigate and potentially prosecute voters who registered without \n1188   providing proof of citizenship. \n4.  The  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  continues  a  baseless  assault  on \n1199  \nArizona’s election system based on a conspiracy theory that non-citizens are voting, despite \n2200  \na persistent lack of credible evidence to support such claims. The Restriction is the newest \n2211  \nin a series of cynical and bad faith attempts to use these politically motivated and false \n2222  \nallegations to limit access to voting by eligible, lawful citizens. And the new law’s \n2233  \n2244  \n \n1 See Laurie Roberts, Republicans want HOW MANY Arizonans to prove they have a right \n2255  \nto  vote?,  The  Ariz.  Republic  (March  28,  2022,  9:12  AM), \n2266   https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/03/28/arizona-voters-\nmay-soon-prove-right-vote-citizenship/7192260001/. \n2277  \n2 On April 22, 2022, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed into law S.B. 1638, which \nprovides that H.B 2492 “is effective from and after December 31, 2022.” S.B. 1638 § 4, \n2288  \n55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022). \n  \n-2- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 5 of 24\n \n11   limitations on early voting are particularly pernicious given the prevalence of early voting \n22   by mail in Arizona. In 2020, a record-setting 88 percent of voters used Arizona’s early \n33   voting by mail system to cast their ballots. But, even before the pandemic, early voting was \n44   the most common form of voting in the state. In 2016, over 2 million Arizona voters—or \nabout 75 percent of those who participated in the election—used early voting. Even in \n55  \n2008, more than a million voters—or close to half of those participating—used early \n66  \nvoting. And, as more voters have turned to early voting by mail, Arizona’s election \n77  \nadministrators have responded by diverting their resources to support mail-in voting, \n88  \nanticipating that the overwhelming majority of Arizona voters will exercise their right to \n99  \nvote by mail. As a result, in-person voting facilities and opportunities have dramatically \n1100  \ndecreased.  \n1111  \n5.  In other words, for decades Arizona’s voting system has been oriented \n1122  \ntoward  supporting  and  facilitating  early  mail  voters.  It  was  well-tested  and  well-\n1133  \nestablished. There is no evidence that it was undermined or even vulnerable to abuse or \n1144  \nfraud. Quite to the contrary, both Governor Doug Ducey and Secretary Hobbs have \n1155   repeatedly assured the public and the nation that false claims about the legitimacy of \n1166   Arizona’s 2020 election are to be rejected, that the election was secure and fraud-free, and \n1177   that the results should be trusted. As Governor Ducey emphasized in response to attacks \n1188   on the integrity of the 2020 election: “We’ve been doing early voting since 1992,” and \nclaims about problems with the system or the election are unfounded.3 Despite these \n1199  \nassurances,  multiple  lawsuits  and  contests  brought  by  the  Republican  Party,  former \n2200  \nPresident Donald Trump’s campaign, and their supporters have sought to cast doubt on the \n2211  \noutcome of the 2020 election. Arizona’s state and federal courts responded by rejecting \n2222  \nthose suits and repudiated their champions for their striking lack of evidence. For example, \n2233  \nin a case brought by the Arizona Republican Party to challenge the legitimacy of Maricopa \n2244  \nCounty’s audit, the Superior Court ordered the party to pay attorney’s fees to the Secretary \n2255  \nof State under A.R.S. § 12-349 because the lawsuit was “groundless,” brought in “bad \n2266  \nfaith,” and served only to “cast false shadows on the election’s legitimacy.” Order at 9-10, \n2277  \n \n3  @DougDucey,  Twitter  (Nov.  30,  2020,  9:48  PM) \n2288  \nhttps://twitter.com/dougducey/status/1333603891863191552? ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw. \n  \n-3- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 6 of 24\n \n11   Ariz. Republican Party v. Fontes, No. CV 2020-014553, (Mar. 12, 2021). \n22   6.  The same false narratives sowed the groundwork for the Proof of Citizenship \n33   Restriction, and now, as a result, tens of thousands of Arizonans will be forced to jump \n44   through unnecessary hoops to access the mail voting system upon which they have come \nto rely, and to vote in presidential elections whether by mail or in person. Some of those \n55  \nlawful,  eligible  Arizona  voters  will  be  unable  to  clear  the  Restriction’s  hurdles.  As \n66  \nmanifested by state officials’ full-throated defense of Arizona’s election system in the \n77  \nimmediate aftermath of the November 2020 election, as well as multiple court decisions \n88  \nrelated to the same, there are no state interests, much less compelling ones, to justify the \n99  \nnew imposition of these unjustifiable and disparate burdens. There is no evidence that any \n1100  \nof Arizona’s voting methods are beset by fraud, and no credible evidence that non-citizens \n1111  \nare attempting to overcome (much less actually overcoming) the numerous safeguards \n1122  \nArizona has put in place to limit voting in Arizona to United States citizens. The Proof of \n1133  \nCitizenship Restriction is an entirely illegitimate and unconstitutional roadblock erected in \n1144  \nthe path of lawful, eligible voters. For these reasons and those detailed below, Plaintiffs \n1155   respectfully  request  a  declaration  that  the  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  is \n1166   unconstitutional and an order enjoining its enforcement. \n1177   JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1188   7.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 to redress \nthe deprivation, under the color of state law, of their rights under the First and Fourteenth \n1199  \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution  \n2200  \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant \n2211  \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1357. \n2222  \n9.

Plaintiff Mi Familia Vota (“MFV”) is a national, non-profit civic engagement \n1111  \norganization with a mission of uniting Latino, immigrant, and allied communities to \n1122  \npromote social and economic justice through increased civic participation by encouraging \n1133  \nleadership development, citizenship, and issue organizing. MFV encourages non-partisan \n1144  \nvoter registration and voter participation and has challenged voter suppression around the \n1155   nation. See, e.g., Mi Familia Vota v. Hobbs, No: 2:21-cv-01423-DWL (D. Ariz. filed Aug. \n1166   17, 2021); Mi Familia Vota v. Abbott, 497 F. Supp. 3d 195 (W.D. Tex. 2020). It has \n1177   operations in six states, including Arizona, where it is headquartered. More than 14,000 \n1188   Arizonans follow and engage with MFV via email and/or MFV’s social media platforms. \n15.  In advance of the 2020 election, MFV organized voter registration drives and \n1199  \nconducted get-out-the-vote activities. MFV helped countless Arizonans register to vote \n2200  \nusing a Federal Form and helped countless Arizonans register to vote by mail. MFV also \n2211  \nconducted  voter  education  campaigns  and  provided  other  voter  assistance,  including \n2222  \ndriving voters to polling locations.  \n2233  \n16.  MFV plans to organize the same activities for future elections. As a result of \n2244  \nthe Proof of Citizenship Restriction, however, MFV must divert money, personnel, time, \n2255  \nand resources away from other programming in order to dedicate more resources toward \n2266  \nefforts  to  ensure  that  voters  can  navigate  the  restrictions  imposed  by  the  Proof  of \n2277  \nCitizenship Restriction. Additionally, MFV plans to hire additional staff to help educate \n2288  \nvoters about the Proof of Citizenship Restriction and is considering developing public \n  \n-5- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 8 of 24\n \n11   service announcements in Spanish-language media concerning the changes. MFV will also \n22   expend resources confirming that voters who previously registered to vote either (1) pre-\n33   2005 or (2) post-2005 using the Federal Form, are not prohibited from voting early by mail \n44   or in presidential elections due to the Proof of Citizenship Restriction.   \n17.  Plaintiff Voto Latino is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, social welfare organization that \n55  \nengages, educates, and empowers Latinx communities across the United States, working \n66  \nto ensure that Latinx voters are enfranchised and included in the democratic process. In \n77  \nfurtherance of its mission, Voto Latino expends significant resources to register and \n88  \nmobilize thousands of Latinx voters each election cycle, including the nearly 1.2 million \n99  \neligible Latinx voters in Arizona.4 Voto Latino considers eligible Latinx voters in Arizona \n1100  \nto be the core of its constituency.  \n1111  \n18.  Voto Latino mobilizes Latinx voters in Arizona through statewide voter \n1122  \nregistration initiatives, as well as peer-to-peer and digital voter education and get-out-the-\n1133  \nvote campaigns. From 2017 to 2020, Voto Latino registered over 50,000 new voters in \n1144  \nArizona. Of those registered voters, countless individuals registered using the Federal Form \n1155   and registered to vote by mail.  \n1166   19.  For future elections, Voto Latino anticipates making expenditures in the \n1177   millions of dollars to educate, register, mobilize, and turn out Latinx voters across the \n1188   United States, including in Arizona. Voto Latino, however, must divert money, personnel, \ntime, and resources away from its other registration initiatives toward efforts to ensure that \n1199  \nLatinx voters in Arizona can navigate the restrictions imposed by the Proof of Citizenship \n2200  \nRestriction. This will include expending staff time and money seeking to acquire data on \n2211  \nindividuals who will lose their right to vote by mail and vote in presidential elections due \n2222  \nto the Proof of Citizenship Restriction, and working to ensure that voters who can no longer \n2233  \nvote by mail due to the Proof of Citizenship Restriction are aware of this limitation and are \n2244  \nstill able to exercise the franchise.   \n2255  \n \n2266   4 According to the Pew Research Center’s analysis of 2018 American Community Survey \ndata (IPUMS) and Census Data 2018 ACS 1-year estimates (tables B05003 and B05003I), \n2277  \nthis number is approximately 1,188,000.

Defendant Katie Hobbs is the Secretary of State of Arizona and is the Chief \n22   Elections Officer for Arizona. Ariz. Const. art. V, § 9; A.R.S. § 16-142. As Arizona’s Chief \n33   Elections Officer, the Secretary is responsible for carrying out the state’s election laws and \n44   overseeing the voting process—and is empowered with broad authority to carry out that \nresponsibility. As such, the Secretary has the authority to promulgate rules and procedures \n55  \nfor elections, including rules and regulations pertaining to voter registration. A.R.S. §§ 16-\n66  \n452, 16-168(J). Moreover, the Secretary is charged with enforcing the new statutory \n77  \nprovisions at issue here. A.R.S. § 16-143. The Secretary is sued in her official capacity for \n88  \nactions taken under color of state law. \n99  \n21.  Defendant Mark Brnovich is the Attorney General of Arizona and the State’s \n1100  \nchief  legal  officer.  A.R.S. § 41-192.  The  Attorney  General  is  authorized  to  enforce \n1111  \nArizona’s election laws in “any election for state office, members of the legislature, justices \n1122  \nof the supreme court, judges of the court of appeals or statewide initiative or referendum \n1133  \n. . . through civil and criminal actions.” A.R.S. § 16-1021. Moreover, the Attorney General \n1144  \nis charged with enforcing the new statutory provisions at issue here. A.R.S. § 16-143. The \n1155   Attorney General is sued in his official capacity for actions taken under color of state law.   \n1166   22.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction makes county recorders responsible for \n1177   implementing  and  enforcing  the  statutory  provisions  at  issue  here.  Amongst  other \n1188   responsibilities, county recorders are charged with verifying a voter’s citizenship status, \nrejecting  voter  registration  applications  if  the  county  recorder  cannot  confirm  an \n1199  \napplicant’s  citizenship  status,  forwarding  applications  to  the  Attorney  General  for \n2200  \ninvestigation, and canceling a voter’s registration based on citizenship. See generally H.B. \n2211  \n2492. The County Recorder Defendants listed below are sued in their official capacities for \n2222  \nactions taken under color of state law. \n2233  \n23.

Despite the lack of any credible fraud allegations, there has been a decades-\n1133   long effort in Arizona—as the state’s electorate has become more diverse—to restrict the \n1144   franchise and impose unjustifiable impediments to the right to vote. These changes have \n1155   led to disenfranchisement, multiple conflicting systems, and repeated litigation.  \n1166   39.  As is particularly relevant here, in 2004 Arizona voters adopted Proposition \n200, a ballot initiative purportedly designed “to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to \n1177  \npresent proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to present identification when \n1188  \nthey vote on election day.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 2 (2006) (per curiam). \n1199  \nProposition 200 amended the state’s election code to require county recorders to “reject \n2200  \nany application for registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United \n2211  \nStates citizenship.” A.R.S. § 16–166(F). This requirement was seemingly in direct conflict \n2222  \nwith the NVRA, which requires states to “accept and use” a standard federal registration \n2233  \nform for voter registration (the “Federal Form”) that does not require applicants to provide \n2244  \ndocumentary proof of citizenship. 52 U.S.C. § 20505. And, in fact, the Supreme Court held \n2255  \nin 2013 that the NVRA precluded Arizona from requiring applicants who used the NVRA’s \n2266  \nFederal Form to submit information beyond that required by the form itself. Inter Tribal \n2277   Council of Ariz., 570 U.S. at 15 (“We conclude that . . . a state-imposed requirement of \n2288   evidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is ‘inconsistent with’ the NVRA’s \n  \n-8- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 11 of 24\n \n11   mandate that States ‘accept and use’ the Federal Form.” (quoting Ex parte Siebold, 100 \n22   U.S. 371, 397 (1880))).   \n33   40.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Inter Tribal Council left open the \n44   possibility of imposing different requirements for voters in state and local elections than \nfederal elections. Then-Attorney General Thomas Horne issued an Opinion on October 7, \n55  \n2013 stating that such a system was required to comply with both state law and the NVRA, \n66  \nsee  Ariz.  Att’y  Gen.  Op.  No.  I13-011  (Oct.  7,  2013),  available  at \n77  \nhttps://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2018-06/I13-011.pdf (last visited Mar. 30, 2022), \n88  \nand then-Secretary of State Ken Bennett subsequently implemented Arizona’s bifurcated \n99  \nvoter registration system, which has been in place ever since.  \n1100  \n41.  Under this bifurcated system, Arizona has three classes of voters: (1) those \n1111  \nwho registered pre-2005 and did not have to show proof of citizenship, who have been \n1122  \npermitted to vote in all elections; (2) those who registered post-2005 using the Federal \n1133  \nForm and did not show evidence of citizenship, who have been permitted to vote only in \n1144  \nfederal elections; and (3) those who registered post-2005 and showed adequate proof of \n1155   citizenship,  who  have  been  permitted  to  vote  in  all  elections.  Prior  to  the  Proof  of \n1166   Citizenship Restriction, all of these voters were entitled to vote in elections for which they \n1177   were qualified by mail, a right which Arizona has provided to all voters for any reason \n1188   since 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. \n42.  This bifurcated system has already led to disenfranchisement and confusion, \n1199  \nresulting in further litigation. For example, prior to 2018, voters who used Arizona’s state \n2200  \nregistration form and provided no evidence of citizenship were not registered to vote in \n2211  \nany elections, while voters who undertook the same process but used the Federal Form to \n2222  \nregister were registered to vote in federal elections. See generally Consent Decree. What’s \n2233  \nmore, because Arizona has documentary proof of citizenship for some citizens from their \n2244  \ndriver’s license application, some citizens who register to vote with the Federal Form have \n2255  \nalready provided proof of citizenship in a means that is easily verifiable, and the state can \n2266  \neasily search for such voters’ documentation and allow them to vote in all elections. Id. \n2277  \n43.  Due to these issues, in 2017, the League of United Latin American Citizens \n2288  \nArizona and the Arizona Students’ Association sued then-Secretary of State Michele \n  \n-9- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 12 of 24\n \n11   Reagan and then-Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, alleging that the state’s dual \n22   voter registration policies constituted an undue burden on the right to vote and that the \n33   state’s failure to register voters who used the state form without providing proof of \n44   citizenship in federal elections had disenfranchised “at least 26,000 otherwise eligible \nvoters . . . in Maricopa County alone.” Compl. ¶¶ 39, 77-88, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-\n55  \ncv-04102-DGC (Nov. 7, 2017), ECF No. 1. The parties entered into a consent decree to \n66  \nend the litigation, which required (1) Arizona to treat all registrants the same regardless of \n77  \nwhether they use the state form or Federal Form, registering all voters for federal elections; \n88  \nand (2) state and county officials to check the motor vehicles database for citizenship \n99  \ndocumentation before limiting voters to federal-only elections. See Consent Decree at 7-\n1100  \n16. \n1111  \n44.  As it presently stands, hundreds of thousands of Arizonans are registered to \n1122  \nvote without having provided documentary proof of citizenship to the state. This includes \n1133  \n31,000 voters in Arizona who are registered using only the Federal Form.5 Additionally, \n1144  \nArizona did not require proof of citizenship to get a driver’s license until 1996, and the \n1155   Motor Vehicle Division has reported that at least 192,000 Arizonans who have one of those \n1166   pre-1996 licenses have not re-registered or provided proof of citizenship.6 Accordingly, \n1177   there are at least 192,000 voters who are seemingly entitled to vote in all elections in \n1188   Arizona despite never providing proof of citizenship. \nB. Arizona voters rely on the state’s early voting system. \n1199  \n2200   45.  Early mail voting is immensely popular in Arizona, and for years, the vast \n2211   majority of voters have relied on it to cast their ballot. Since 1991, all eligible voters in \nArizona have been able to vote early by mail without a reason or “excuse” for doing so. \n2222  \nSee A.R.S. § 16-541. Reliance on early mail voting has steadily grown ever since. In 2008, \n2233  \nover one million Arizonans, or around half of the voters who participated in the election, \n2244  \nused early mail voting. In 2016, over 2 million voters, or about 75 percent of voters who \n2255  \n2266    \n5 See Howard Fischer, Some Arizona voters could face citizenship check, Ariz.

And in 2020, nearly three million \n22   voters, or about 88 percent of those voters who participated in the election, used early mail \n33   voting. \n44   46.  The ever-increasing reliance on early voting by mail in Arizona has led to an \nelection-administration system heavily oriented toward mail voting, with a corresponding \n55  \ndecrease in the availability of in-person voting options. In fact, one study found that the \n66  \nstate has had the “most widespread reduction” in polling places of any state over the last \n77  \ndecade—the state now has 320 fewer polling places than it did in 2012.7 While Arizona’s \n88  \ninducement of voters to use early voting by mail has helped to make voting generally more \n99  \naccessible in the state and has helped counties preserve resources, fewer polling places \n1100  \ntranslates to more difficulties for those who must vote in person. This is especially true in \n1111  \nrural places and on the state’s tribal lands, where voters must travel long distances to their \n1122  \npolling place and where public transportation is not available.  \n1133  \nC. The 2020 election in Arizona was secure and accurate. \n1144  \n47.  Despite the significant challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, \n1155  \nArizona voters turned out in record-setting numbers in 2020. More than 3.4 million of the \n1166  \nstate’s 4.3 million voters, or 79.9 percent, cast a ballot. This compares to 74 percent in \n1177  \n2016, 74.2 percent in 2012, 74.3 percent in 2008, 77.7 percent in 2004, and 71.8 percent in \n1188   2000.8 \n1199   48.  The security and accuracy of the 2020 election results have been confirmed \n2200   and re-confirmed by county and state election officials, as well as the courts.  \n2211   49.  County election officials have confirmed and scrutinized the results. For \nexample, after the election, pursuant to A.R.S. § 16-602, ten of the state’s fifteen counties \n2222  \nperformed a hand count of sample ballots to test the equipment, each confirming the \n2233  \nelection’s initial results.  \n2244  \n \n2255  \n7 See The Leadership Conference Education Fund, Democracy Diverted: Polling Place \n2266   Closures  and  the  Right  to  Vote  17  (Sept.  2019), \nhttp://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/reports/Democracy-Diverted.pdf.   \n2277  \n8  Voter  Registration  and  Historical  Election  Data,  Ariz.

In Arizona’s largest county, Clint Hickman, the chair of the Maricopa County \n22   Board of Supervisors, confirmed that “there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct or \n33   malfunction” in a letter that was sent to all Maricopa County voters.9  \n44   51.  In  February  2021,  the  Maricopa  County  Elections  Department  further \nconfirmed its results, hiring two auditing firms to conduct audits of the county’s tabulation \n55  \nsystem and equipment, which found no evidence of inaccuracies or improprieties.10 \n66  \n52.  State officials have likewise confirmed the results and have publicly and \n77  \ndefinitively declared their accuracy. Arizona law requires the Secretary, in the Governor’s \n88  \npresence, to certify the statewide canvass. See A.R.S. § 16-648. On November 30, 2020, \n99  \nSecretary of State Katie Hobbs, in the presence of Governor Ducey, did so. The Governor \n1100  \nhimself further confirmed and defended the accuracy of the results through his social media \n1111  \naccounts and in a meeting at the White House with former President Trump. \n1122  \n53.  Additionally, multiple lawsuits seeking to overturn the results of the election \n1133  \nonly served to further confirm that the election was secure. For example, in Bowyer v. \n1144  \nDucey, various Republican officials filed a lawsuit seeking decertification of the election \n1155   based on, among other things, allegations of improprieties in signature matching. The court \n1166   dismissed the suit on multiple grounds, including a lack of any evidence. 506 F. Supp. 3d \n1177   699, 722 (D. Ariz. Dec. 9, 2020).  \n1188   54.  Similarly, in Ward v. Jackson, the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that \nthe Republican challenger failed to “establish any degree of fraud or a sufficient error rate \n1199  \nthat would undermine the certainty of the election results.” No. CV-20-0343-AP/EL, 2020 \n2200  \nWL 8617817, at *2 (Ariz.

In particular, these same \n22   baseless and repeatedly disproven “concerns” have continued to animate claims of fraud \n33   pushed by many Republican officials in the state.  \n44   D. H.B. 2492 is merely the latest in a string of baseless allegations of fraud that \nhave led to a host of pernicious efforts in Arizona to target early voting by \n55   mail. \n66  \n56.  When the 2021 legislative session began, Republicans in the Legislature \n77  \nmoved quickly to introduce several bills to severely restrict access to the franchise in \n88   Arizona, relying on continuing evidence-free allegations of fraud in Arizona elections. This \n99   resulted in the passage of two bills in the 2021 legislative session that restrict the franchise: \n1100   (1) S.B. 1003, which prohibits voters whose early voting by mail ballots are flagged for \n1111   rejection based on a missing signature from curing that deficiency after 7 p.m. on Election \nDay;  and  (2)  S.B.  1485,  which  fundamentally  alters  the  state’s  immensely  popular \n1122  \nPermanent Early Voting List—which the new legislation rebrands as the Active Early \n1133  \nVoting List—by requiring election officials to purge from the list any voter who has not \n1144  \nvoted an early ballot “for two consecutive election cycles.” Both bills are aimed squarely \n1155  \nat suppressing voter participation using Arizona’s early voting regime. \n1166  \n57.  Legislation is not the only means of this ongoing assault on early voting by \n1177  \nmail. The Arizona Republican Party recently initiated litigation in the Arizona Supreme \n1188  \nCourt seeking an order declaring that all no-excuse early voting by mail in Arizona, as well \n1199  \nas the use of drop boxes to return ballots, violate the Arizona Constitution. See Compl., \n2200  \nAriz. Republican Party v. Hobbs, No. CV-22-0048-SA (Ariz. Feb. 25, 2022). \n2211  \n58.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction continues this anti-voter trend, marrying \n2222  \nit to Arizona’s nearly twenty-year effort to introduce roadblocks into its voter registration \n2233   regime. The result is a law which has a host of problematic provisions, including: \n2244     requiring that as a qualification of registration an individual “ha[ve] \n2255   provided satisfactory evidence of citizenship” and revising the definition \n2266   of a “qualified elector” in Arizona to include that such person must have \n2277  \n2288  \n  \n-13- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 16 of 24\n \n11   “provided satisfactory evidence of citizenship.” (Sections 1, 2);11 \n22     prohibiting  any  registered  voter  (other  than  voters  protected  by  the \n33   Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) who has not \n44   provided adequate proof of citizenship—including potentially all voters \nregistered  before  2005  and  all  federal-only  voters—from  voting  in \n55  \npresidential elections until they provide adequate proof of citizenship, \n66  \nwith no provisions for how such voters should or will receive notice of \n77  \nany such prohibition (Section 5); \n88  \n  prohibiting all voters in Arizona who can currently vote only in federal \n99  \nelections from voting early by mail in any elections (Section 5);  \n1100  \n  prohibiting Arizonans who seek to register without adequate proof of \n1111  \ncitizenship from registering to vote in presidential elections or from \n1122  \nvoting early by mail (Section 4); \n1133  \n  requiring county recorders to reject the application of any voter who \n1144  \nsubmits a state registration form without proof of citizenship (Section 4); \n1155  \n  requiring county recorders to research the citizenship of any voter who \n1166  \nsubmits a Federal Form, prohibit any such voter from voting in any \n1177  \nelection if the county recorder cannot determine they are a United States \n1188   citizen, and refer any such voter’s registration to the county attorney and \n1199   Attorney General for investigation if the county recorder determines they \n2200   are not a United States citizen (Section 4); \n2211     requiring the Secretary of State and county recorders to provide a list to \nthe Attorney General of any voters who are registered without proof of \n2222  \ncitizenship,  and  requiring  the  Attorney  General  to  investigate  the \n2233  \ncitizenship of these individuals and report to the Secretary of State, the \n2244  \nPresident of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House regarding the \n2255  \n2266    \n11 Arizona does not permit an individual to vote “unless such person’s name appears as a \n2277  \nqualified elector in both the general county register and in the precinct register or list of the \nprecinct and election districts or proposed election districts in which such person resides.” \n2288  \nA.R.S. § 16-122. \n  \n-14- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 17 of 24\n \n11   results of his investigation (Section 7); and \n22     requiring  the  Attorney  General  to  prosecute  any  individuals  his \n33   investigation uncovers who are not United States citizens (Section 7). \n44   E. The burdens imposed by the Proof of Citizenship Restriction on the right to \nvote are substantial. \n55  \n59.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction burdens Arizona voters’ ability to vote \n66  \nby mail and in presidential elections in at least four different ways.  \n77  \n60.  First, registered voters who properly registered to vote without providing \n88  \nproof of citizenship—either due to state requirements at the time they registered or because \n99  \nthey submitted the Federal Form—may be prohibited from voting in presidential elections \n1100  \nwithout any notice or opportunity to challenge the State’s determination. H.B. 2492 § 5, \n1111  \n55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022). This includes nearly 200,000 Arizonans who \n1122  \nregistered to vote before October 1, 1996,12 and 31,000 Arizonans who registered using the \n1133   Federal Form.13  \n1144   61.  Furthermore,  those  31,000  Arizonans  who  registered  to  vote  using  the \n1155   Federal Form would be prohibited from voting early by mail, again without any notice or \n1166   opportunity to challenge the State’s determination. H.B. 2492 § 5, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. \n(Ariz. 2022). As discussed above, Arizona has allowed voters to vote by mail for any reason \n1177  \nsince 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. To now suddenly strip these registered voters of their \n1188  \nability to vote by mail without any notice substantially burdens their fundamental right to \n1199  \nvote. \n2200  \n62.  It bears repeating that despite depriving these voters of their right to vote in \n2211  \npresidential  elections  or  early  by  mail,  the  statute  does  not  include  any  procedural \n2222  \nsafeguards. There is no notice requirement. There is no opportunity for the voter to provide \n2233  \n2244  \n \n12 See Laurie Roberts, Republicans want HOW MANY Arizonans to prove they have a right \n2255  \nto  vote?,  The  Ariz.  Republic  (March  28,  2022,  9:12  AM), \n2266   https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/03/28/arizona-voters-\nmay-soon-prove-right-vote-citizenship/7192260001/. \n2277  \n13 See Howard Fischer, Some Arizona voters could face citizenship check, Ariz. Daily Star \n(Mar.  27,  2022),  https://tucson.com/news/local/subscriber/some-arizona-voters-could-\n2288  \nface-citizenship-check/article_72ec0350-ac76-11ec-a0d7-2fbe0dcb9094.html. \n  \n-15- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 18 of 24\n \n11   documentary proof of citizenship. The statute does not even outline a time frame during \n22   which this removal of rights should occur. This lack of process will result in registered \n33   voters being left in the dark about whether and how they can vote. \n44   63.  Second, the State has once again added another wrinkle to what was already \na confusing, bifurcated voter registration system that frustrates Arizonans’ right to vote. \n55  \nThis system has already resulted in allegations of disenfranchisement resulting in an \n66  \nongoing consent decree, whose requirements seem potentially in conflict with the Proof of \n77  \nCitizenship Restriction. See Compl. ¶¶ 39, 77-88, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-cv-04102-\n88  \nDGC (Nov. 7, 2017), ECF No. 1; Consent Decree at 7-16. The law will likely undo any \n99  \nharm the consent decree has averted, again resulting in the disenfranchisement of eligible \n1100  \nvoters who cannot navigate Arizona’s needlessly confusing, byzantine, and ever-changing \n1111  \nvoter registration system. \n1122  \n64.  Third, the law will require hundreds of thousands of voters who never had to \n1133  \nprovide further documentation to do so if they wish to continue to vote in presidential \n1144  \nelections or, for Federal Form voters, to continue voting early by mail for any election. For \n1155   many voters who lack such documentation, the costs in time and effort to obtain it are \n1166   substantial, and result in many voters simply giving up and being disenfranchised. Other \n1177   courts considering challenges to similar laws have found these consequences to constitute \n1188   a substantial burden on the right to vote. See, e.g., Fish v. Schwab, 957 F.3d 1105, 1131 \n(10th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 965 (2020) (explaining that “extensive testimony \n1199  \nabout individual voters like Mr. Fish and Ms. Bucci who lacked [proof of citizenship] or \n2200  \nfaced significant costs to obtain it” permitted “the district court [to] properly conclude here \n2211  \nthat the [citizenship documentation] requirement imposed a significant burden on the right \n2222  \nto vote”); League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“It \n2233  \ndoes not matter whether that is because they lack access to the requisite documentary proof \n2244  \nor simply because the process of obtaining that proof is so onerous that they give up. The \n2255  \noutcome is the same—the abridgment of the right to vote.”). \n2266  \n65.  Fourth, the law subjects potential voters to investigation by the Attorney \n2277  \nGeneral based solely on a county recorder’s inability to locate them in certain enumerated \n2288  \ndatabases. Such inability could result from something as simple as a typographical or \n  \n-16- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 19 of 24\n \n11   transcription error, and fear of wrongful investigation may chill otherwise eligible voters \n22   from seeking to register to vote or exercising the franchise.  \n33   66.  Taken together, this host of harms constitutes a substantial burden on the \n44   right to vote. \nF.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction serves no justifiable state interest. \n55  \n66   67.  As with so many pernicious voting restrictions, proponents of the Proof of \nCitizenship Restriction justify it by invoking the boogeyman of voter fraud without any \n77  \nproof  to  support  their  claims.  During  the  Legislature’s  consideration  of  the  Bill,  no \n88  \nlegislator identified a single instance of voter fraud or impropriety in Arizona related to \n99  \nmail-in early voting ballots that would precipitate the need for the changes at issue. Instead, \n1100  \nevidence-free assertions were offered such as that by Bill Sponsor Rep. Jake Hoffman, who \n1111  \nstated that the Bill was needed because Arizona “cannot allow potentially tens of thousands \n1122  \nof noncitizens to vote in our elections.”14 This unsupported fearmongering is plainly \n1133  \ninsufficient to justify the Proof of Citizenship Restriction’s widespread burdens. \n1144  \n68.  Meanwhile,  the  Legislature’s  own  lawyers  advised  that  the  Proof  of \n1155  \nCitizenship Restriction violates federal law and invites litigation.15 Indeed, Speaker Pro \n1166  \nTempore of the Arizona House Travis Grantham acknowledged that a motivation behind \n1177  \nthe law is to broadly challenge the constitutionality of the NVRA, stating that the law was \n1188   important to “fight for local control of our elections” and that challenging related federal \n1199  \n2200  \n2211  \n \n2222  \n14 See Katya Schwenk, ‘Extreme’ Arizona Elections Bill Inching Closer to Law, Phoenix \nNew  Times  (March  30,  2022,  6:00  AM), \n2233  \nhttps://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/extreme-arizona-elections-bills-inching-closer-\n2244   to-law-13323436. \n15 See Trevor Potter, This Arizona bill could keep you from voting early, by mail or for \n2255  \npresident,  AZ  Central  (March  27,  2022,  6:00  AM), \n2266   https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2022/03/27/arizona-bill-could-keep-you-\nvoting-early-president/7158739001/; Howard Fischer, GOP lawmakers seek to reopen \n2277  \nlegal  voting  issue,  Daily  Independent  (March  26,  2022,  9:00  AM), \nhttps://www.yourvalley.net/stories/gop-lawmakers-seek-to-reopen-legal-voting-\n2288  \nissue,293949. \n  \n-17- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 20 of 24\n \n11   rulings was “a fight worth having.”16 But disagreement with and open defiance of federal \n22   law is also insufficient to justify the Proof of Citizenship Restriction’s significant burdens \n33   on Arizonans’ voting rights. \n44   69.  Other courts have rightfully found similar laws to be unconstitutional. For \nexample, in 2011 Kansas adopted a law that required state and county election officials to \n55  \nreject voter registration applications unless the applicant submitted “satisfactory evidence \n66  \nof United States citizenship.” Fish, 957 F.3d at 1111 (quoting Secure and Fair Elections \n77  \n(“SAFE”) Act, ch. 56, § 8(l), 2011 Kan. Sess. Laws 795, 806, 809–11 (codified at Kan. \n88  \nStat. Ann. § 25–2309(l))). The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit \n99  \nultimately held that the Kansas law violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection \n1100  \nClause because it was an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote and that it was also \n1111  \npreempted by Section 5 of the NVRA. Id. at 1121. The Court found particularly relevant \n1122  \nthe  fact  that  the  Kansas  law  impacted  31,089  applicants  who  were  prevented  from \n1133  \nregistering to vote distinguished this from other voting restrictions where the burden was \n1144  \nless clear. See id. at 1129.  \n1155   70.  As noted above, the Proof of Citizenship Restriction imposes significant new \n1166   restrictions and burdens on a minimum of approximately 200,000 Arizonans, an impact \n1177   over six times greater than that which gave the Tenth Circuit such pause in Fish. As in \n1188   Fish,  there  can  be  little  doubt  that  the  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  imposes  an \nunconstitutional burden on the right to vote. \n1199  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n2200  \nCOUNT I \n2211  \nUnjustifiable Burden on the Right to Vote  \n2222  \nU.S. Const.

A court considering a challenge to a state election law must carefully balance \n22   the character and magnitude of injury to the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights that \n33   the Plaintiffs seek to vindicate against the justifications put forward by the state for the \n44   burdens imposed by the rule. Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992); Anderson v. \nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983).  \n55  \n73.  “However slight th[e] burden may appear, . . . it must be justified by relevant \n66  \nand legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.” Crawford v. \n77  \nMarion  Cnty.  Election  Bd.,  553  U.S.  181,  191  (2008)  (Stevens,  J.,  controlling  op.) \n88  \n(quotations marks omitted).  \n99  \n74.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction imposes a disparate and unjustifiable \n1100  \nburden on the right to vote. As detailed above, it strips voters of the right to vote in \n1111  \npresidential elections or by mail without notice, adds further confusion to what was already \n1122  \na convoluted registration process that has led to disenfranchisement, imposes substantial \n1133  \nnew costs on hundreds of thousands of Arizonans to exercise the franchise, and exposes \n1144  \nvoters to the threat of baseless investigation by the Attorney General. Both individually \n1155   and in combination these harms impose a significant—and in many cases severe—burden \n1166   on the right to vote. \n1177   75.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction also arbitrarily treats Arizona voters \n1188   differently based solely on which voter registration form they happen to use. Those voters \nregistering using the Federal Form without proof of citizenship will be entitled to vote in \n1199  \nfederal  congressional  elections,  while  the  same  voter  presenting  the  same  proof  of \n2200  \neligibility but using a state form will have their registration rejected entirely. Such equal \n2211  \nprotection  concerns  regarding  elections  law  are  also  properly  evaluated  under  the \n2222  \nAnderson-Burdick framework.  See, e.g., Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1106 n.15 (9th \n2233  \nCir. 2011). \n2244  \n76.  These burdens are not justified by any sufficient state interest.  \n2255  \n2266  \n2277  \n2288  \n  \n-19- \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 38   Filed 05/13/22   Page 22 of 24\n \n11   COUNT II \n22   Denial of Procedural Due Process \nU.S. Const.

Plaintiffs reallege and reincorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 70 as \n55  \nthough fully set forth herein. \n66  \n78.  To determine whether a plaintiff has been denied procedural due process in \n77  \nviolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a court first asks \n88  \nwhether a constitutionally protected liberty interest is at stake. If so, the court determines \n99  \nwhether the procedural protections provided are sufficient by applying the Anderson-\n1100   Burdick test as described above. Ariz. Democratic Party v. Hobbs, 18 F.4th 1179, 1195 \n1111   (9th Cir. 2021) (holding that “the Anderson/Burdick approach is better suited to the context \n1122   of election laws than is the more general Eldridge test” (quoting Richardson v. Tex. Sec’y \n1133   of State, 978 F.3d 220, 234 (5th Cir. 2020))).  \n79.  The right to vote is a fundamental constitutional right. Harper v. Va. State \n1144  \nBd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 667 (1966). “Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory \n1155  \nif the right to vote is undermined.” Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 17. Because Arizona allows all \n1166  \nregistered voters to exercise their fundamental right to vote early by mail, there is a \n1177  \nconstitutionally protected liberty interest involved in the process of casting a ballot by mail \n1188  \nand in having that ballot counted. See, e.g., Democracy N.C. v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, \n1199  \n476  F.  Supp  3d  158,  227  (M.D.N.C.  2020)  (holding  that  “North  Carolina,  having \n2200  \n‘authorized the use of absentee ballots,’ must afford appropriate due process protections to \n2211  \nthe use of the absentee ballots”); Martin v.

Ga. \n2222  \n2018) (“Courts around the country have recognized that ‘[w]hile it is true that absentee \n2233  \nvoting is a privilege and a convenience to voters, this does not grant the state the latitude \n2244   to deprive citizens of due process with respect to the exercise of this privilege.’”) (quoting \n2255   Raetzel v. Parks/Bellemont Absentee Election Bd., 762 F. Supp. 1354, 1358 (D. Ariz. \n2266   1990)); Zessar v. Helander, No. 05 C 1917, 2006 WL 642646, at *5 (N.D. Ill.

As a \n22   result, Defendants may not deprive voters of the right to vote early by mail without \n33   providing adequate procedures. \n44   80.  Arizona’s  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  will  deprive  hundreds  of \nthousands of currently registered voters of their ability to vote by mail in future elections. \n55  \nIt does so while giving no details about any notice these voters will be provided, or how or \n66  \nwhen they may cure this defect. \n77  \n81.  As  detailed  above,  there  is  no  state  interest  which  justifies  stripping \n88  \nregistered voters of the state-protected right to vote early by mail with no notice or \n99  \nopportunity to cure. \n1100  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n1111  \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter the following judgment: \n1122  \nA.

That  much  is \n6  constitutionally uncontroversial. One of the principal disputes here is whether the State \n7  must accept a bare attestation of citizenship as sufficient, or whether it can ask for some \n8  proof of citizenship. This is important to the State as “[t]he right to vote is one of the \n9  badges of citizenship. The dignity and very concept of citizenship are diluted if noncitizens \n10  are allowed to vote.” Barnett v. City of Chicago, 141 F.3d 699 (7th Cir. 1998). Plaintiffs \n11  challenge two statutes (the “Acts”) that relate to this proof requirement. \n12  Plaintiffs’ complaints lack neither numerosity or length: six in all totaling 255 pages \n13  and 965 paragraphs, asserting 34 distinct claims against two statutes. What those claims \n  \n14  do lack, however, is justiciability and merit.  \n15  I. As to justiciability, Private Plaintiffs lack Article III standing because they \n16  (1) cannot adequately allege representational standing without naming individual affected \n17  members—which  none  of  them  have  done,  and  (2)  have  not  adequately  alleged \n18  organizational standing because they do not identify specific resource diversions actually \n19  caused by the Acts and further do not identify what activities resources have been diverted \n20  from, thereby causing injury. Instead, Private Plaintiffs’ allegations amount to “simply a \n21  setback to the organization’s abstract social interests,” which does not satisfy Article \n22 \n \n23  1  This motion seeks dismissal of all five Complaints in the consolidated action (No. 22-\ncv-509), as well as in AAANHPI v. Hobbs, No. 22-cv-1381, in which the State’s motion to \n24 \nconsolidate is pending. The State is concurrently filing a motion for leave in AAANHPI to \nhave this consolidated motion to dismiss apply to that action as well. For all the reasons \n25 \nexplained in the State’s motion to consolidate, the State respectfully submits that this \n26 \napproach is in the interests of judicial economy.  \n   Counsel for the State was alerted yesterday that a seventh action challenging HB 2492 \n27 \nand/or  HB  2243  will  be  filed  Monday,  September  19.  The  State  intends  to  seek \n28  consolidation of that seventh action as well. \n  1 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 15 of 46\n \n \n1  III. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982). In addition, several Private \n2  Plaintiffs here have failed to name all (or any) County Recorders, which prevents them \n3  from establishing Article III traceability and redressability. \n4  Some of the claims at issue here are unripe as well. In particular, Private Plaintiffs \n5  do not allege that any of their members intend not to check the Citizenship Question or fill \n6  in the Birthplace Requirement field. They thus have not alleged “‘a concrete plan’ to \n7  violate the law in question,” that could establish Article III ripeness. Thomas v. Anchorage \n8  Equal Rts. Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). (Any such resulting \n9  injury would likely be self-inflicted in any event.) In addition, prudential ripeness is \n10  lacking for (1) Private Plaintiffs’ speculation that inaccurate or outdated information in \n11  databases will cause injury, (2) Plaintiffs’ equivalent speculation that the Investigation \n12  Requirement will be exploited or implemented in bad faith or otherwise cause significant \n13  injury, and (3) LUCHA’s VRA §2 claim, which is premised on disparate impacts for which \n  \n14  no actual data exists. All of these claims rest on speculation about “‘contingent future \n15  events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” Texas v. United \n16  States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (citation omitted), \n17  II. Private Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims also fail on the merits. Their Anderson-\n18  Burdick unconstitutional burden claims lack merit because the burdens at issue are not \n19  substantial, particularly under the Supreme Court’s decision in Crawford v. Marion Cty. \n20  Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008) and Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383 (9th Cir. 2012) \n21  (en banc). Similarly, the State’s interest in securing its elections and maintaining voter \n22  confidence easily suffice to sustain the Acts under Crawford and Gonzalez.  \n23  Plaintiffs’ various attempts to assert procedural due process claims outside of the \n24  Anderson-Burdick  framework  violates  controlling  Ninth  Circuit  precedent,  including \n25  Arizona Democratic Party v. Hobbs (“Hobbs III”), 18 F.4th 1179, 1195 (9th Cir. 2021). \n26  Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims similarly are not viable. As to their disparate \n27  treatment claims, they fail first because they are governed by the Anderson-Burdick \n28 \n  2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 16 of 46\n \n \n1  framework. They further fail because the Acts are completely facially neutral as to race, \n2  tribal status, age, and virtually every other salient characteristic. The sole distinction—\n3  between those individuals using the Federal Form versus the State Form—is not a suspect \n4  class triggering heightened scrutiny. Furthermore, the State has several rational bases for \n5  distinguishing between the two classes—not least of which is the greater confidence that \n6  the latter individuals are indeed citizens and residents of their districts.  \n7  Finally, Plaintiffs’ intentional discrimination claims fail because Private Plaintiffs \n8  have not plausibly alleged that the Legislature acted with discriminatory intent and do not \n9  supply sufficient non-conclusory allegations to overcome the presumption of good faith. \n10  III. Plaintiffs’ NVRA claims fail because, quite simply, the NVRA does not apply \n11  to registration for any of the elections regulated by the Acts. The Acts address only state \n12  and presidential elections. The NVRA clearly does not apply to state elections. And \n13  Congress’  constitutional  authority  to  regulate  “Elections  for  Senators  and \n  \n14  Representatives,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1, does not extend to presidential elections—\n15  the regulation of which is left to the States. Congress thus does not have constitutional \n16  authority to supersede state laws or enact federal laws relating to presidential elections. In \n17  any event, none of the challenged provisions of the Act run afoul of the NVRA. \n18  IV. Private Plaintiffs’ Section 10101 claims fail at the threshold because they lack \n19  a private right of action to enforce the provision—the majority of courts have held that the \n20  materiality statute is only enforceable in an action brought by the Attorney General. In \n21  addition, Plaintiffs’ claims fail because they attack the validity of a state law, which is \n22  explicitly excepted from the materiality provision (error or omission that is material “under \n23  State law”). The materiality provision targets executive actions that deny the right of an \n24  eligible individual to vote—which is not at issue here. Instead, the Acts prescribe denial \n25  of ineligible potential voters and a cure process, not disenfranchisement, for eligible voters \n26  who have failed to properly register. In any event, the information sought by the Acts is \n27  material to ascertaining eligibility to vote and thus cannot run afoul of Section 10101.  \n28 \n  3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 17 of 46\n \n \n1  V. Finally, LUCHA’s VRA § 2 claim fails to allege a plausible violation of that \n2  provision under Brnovich v. DNC, 141 S. Ct. 2321 (2021). As discussed below, the burdens \n3  involved are not substantial and are justified by compelling state interests. Even more \n4  importantly, LUCHA’s complaint fails to plausibly allege any meaningful disparate racial \n5  impacts. Indeed, the most it says is that the Acts “will not equally affect Arizona residents.” \n6  LUCHA at ¶368. But the VRA does not mandate the complete absence of all disparate \n7  impacts: indeed, it would be “virtually impossible for a State to devise rules that do not \n8  have some disparate impact.” Brnovich, 141 S. Ct. at 2343. The bare allegation of the \n9  existence of speculative and unquantified disparate impacts does not plausibly plead a \n10  violation of section 2. \n11  BACKGROUND \n12  As with nearly every other state, only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in Arizona. \n13  A.R.S. § 16-101(A)(1). This case involves facial challenges to HB 2243 and HB 2492—\n  \n14  two bills recently enacted to promote election modernization, prevent voter fraud, and \n15  safeguard voter confidence in Arizona’s election system, in part by requiring Arizona \n16  residents to show evidence of U.S. citizenship.  \n17  Citizens can register to vote using either the Federal Form or State Form. The \n18  Federal Form does not itself currently require proof of citizenship, and instead only \n19  requires that signer attest that he or she is a U.S. citizen. Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of \n20  Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 7 (2013). The Supreme Court has held that the State is required \n21  to accept the Federal Form, and cannot require POC along with the Federal Form to register \n22  applicants to vote. Id. at 20. Individuals that register using the Federal Form are only \n23  permitted to vote for federal offices and are provided ballots commonly known as the \n24  “Federal Only” ballot.2  \n25 \n26 \n \n2  Arizona Secretary of State, 2019 Elections Procedures Manual, pg 3(A), available at \n27 \nhttps://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/2019_ELECTIONS_PROCEDURES_MANUAL_AP\n28  PROVED.pdf (last accessed September 15, 2022). \n  4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 18 of 46\n \n \n1  A.  HB 2492 \n2  HB 2492 was enacted on March 30, 2022, and is set to take effect on January 1, \n3  2023. One of the bill’s sponsors, Rep. Jake Hoffman, explained that HB 2492, “which \n4  requires verification of U.S. citizenship to be eligible to vote in Arizona elections, is a \n5  giant step toward ensuring elections are easy, convenient, and secure in our state.”3 And, \n6  in signing the bill into law, Governor Ducey stated: “Election integrity means counting \n7  every lawful vote and prohibiting any attempt to illegally cast a vote. HB 2492 is a \n8  balanced approach that honors Arizona’s history of making voting accessible without \n9  sacrificing security in our elections.”4  \n10  The relevant changes of HB 2492 are as follows: \n11  Proof  of  Citizenship  (“POC”)  Requirement.  Only  U.S.  citizens  who  “ha[ve] \n12  provided satisfactory evidence of citizenship as prescribed in section 16-166” (“POC”) are \n13  eligible to vote in Arizona. HB 2492 § 1(A)(1). To show “satisfactory evidence of \n  \n14  citizenship,” a person can use several common forms of identification, including the \n15  number from a driver or nonoperating identification license, copy of a birth certificate, or \n16  copy of a passport. A.R.S. § 16-166(F). A person that does not have these documents can \n17  also  show  “satisfactory  evidence  of  citizenship”  by  providing:  (1) certificate  of \n18  naturalization or the certificate number, (2) other documents or methods of proof that are \n19  established pursuant to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, or (3) an \n20  applicant’s Bureau of Indian Affairs card number, tribal treaty card number, or tribal \n21  enrollment number. Id.  \n22  When a person uses the State Form, the “application for registration shall be \n23  accompanied by satisfactory evidence of citizenship as prescribed in section 16-166, \n24  subsection F.” HB 2492 § 4(C). “[T]he county recorder or other officer in charge of \n25 \n \n26  3  News  Release,  Rep.  Jake  Hoffman  (Mar.  30,  2022), \nhttps://www.azleg.gov/press/house/55LEG/2R/220330HOFFMANHB2492.pdf. \n27 \n4    See  Letter  from  Douglas  A.

Where the application lacks satisfactory evidence of citizenship, “[t]he \n3  county recorder or other officer in charge of elections shall send a notice to the applicant \n4  as prescribed in section 16-134, subsection B.” Id. Section 16-134(B) provides that “the \n5  county recorder shall notify the applicant within ten business days of receipt of the \n6  registration form” and “shall specify the missing or illegible information.” A.R.S. § 16-\n7  134(B).  \n8  POC Procedures Regarding Federal Form. Different procedures apply when the \n9  applicant uses the Federal Form. “[W]ithin ten days after receiving an application for \n10  registration on” the Federal Form, “that is not accompanied by [POC], the county recorder \n11  or other officer in charge of elections shall use all available resources to verify the \n12  citizenship status of the applicant,” including review of a number of specific databases. Id. \n13  If the county official “matches the applicant with information that verifies the applicant is \n  \n14  a United States citizen … the applicant shall be properly registered.” HB 2492 § 4(E). \n15  Significantly, if the applicant provides satisfactory evidence of citizenship/POC, which \n16  includes the number on a naturalization certificate (assuming verification by the USCIS) \n17  or the number from a drivers’ license or nonoperating identification license issued after \n18  October 1, 1996, then the county official must register the applicant and need not use any \n19  databases to confirm citizenship status. HB 2492 § 4.  \n20  However, if the applicant fails to provide POC and the county official “matches the \n21  applicant with information that the applicant is not a United States citizen, the county \n22  recorder … shall reject the application, notify the applicant that the application was \n23  rejected because the applicant is not a United States citizen and forward the application to \n24  the county attorney and attorney general.” HB 2492 § 4(E).  \n25  Presidential-Ballot and In-Person Voting Limitations. For individuals using the \n26  Federal Form, a different rule applies if county recorders can verify neither citizenship nor \n27  absence of U.S. citizenship. In that case, “the county recorder … shall notify the applicant \n28 \n  6 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 20 of 46\n \n \n1  that … [it] could not verify that the applicant is a United States citizen and that the \n2  applicant will not be qualified to vote in a presidential election or by mail … until \n3  satisfactory evidence of citizenship is provided.” Id. Consistent with that notice, section 5 \n4  provides that such voters are “not eligible to receive an early ballot by mail,” (“In-Person \n5  Voting Limitation”) and are “not eligible to vote in presidential elections,” (“Presidential-\n6  Ballot Limitation”). Id. § 5(A). \n7  Proof of Residency (“POR”) Requirement. HB 2492 provides that except for \n8  specified  individuals  temporarily  absent  (e.g.,  military  posted  overseas),  persons \n9  registering to vote must provide “an identifying document that establishes proof of location \n10  of  residence”  (“POR”).  Id.  § 5(A).  Acceptable  documents  include  a  “valid  form  of \n11  identification that bears the photograph, name and address of the elector,” or “[t]wo \n12  different items that contain the name and address of the elector,” such as “a utility bill, a \n13  bank  or  credit  union  statement…,  Arizona  vehicle  registration,  an  Arizona  vehicle \n  \n14  insurance card, an Indian census card, tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal \n15  identification.” A.R.S. § 16-579(A)(1). \n16  Birthplace Requirement and Citizenship Question. HB 2492 adds two additional \n17  requirements  for  the  State  Form:  applicants  must  provide  their  birthplace  under \n18  (“Birthplace Requirement”), and mark a check box if they are a U.S. citizen, (“Citizenship \n19  Question”). HB 2492 § 4(A). That additional information facilitates ascertaining if a \n20  registrant  is  a  U.S.  citizen.  See  U.S.  Const.  amend.  XIV  §1  (establishing  birthright \n21  citizenship). \n22  B.  HB 2243 \n23  HB 2243’s purpose is to ensure effective and fair maintenance of the voter rolls. \n24  The statute requires county officials to conduct monthly reviews of the voter rolls to ensure \n25  registered voters are eligible to vote. HB 2243 § 2(D)-(H). If “the county recorder obtains \n26  information” in performing these reviews and “confirms that the person registered is not a \n27 \n28 \n  7 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 21 of 46\n \n \n1  United States citizen,” then the county recorder must initiate statutorily required process. \n2  Id. § 2(A)(10).  \n3  Under  that  process,  “the  county  recorder  shall  send  the  person  notice  by \n4  forwardable mail that the person’s registration will be canceled in thirty five days unless \n5  the person provides satisfactory evidence of United States citizenship, including among \n6  other possibilities, the number from the registered voter’s driver license, nonoperating \n7  identification license, or naturalization certificate” (“35-Day Notice”).  \n8  Consequently, while the county recorders must review the rolls, they cancel a \n9  registration only when they verify that the registered voter is not a U.S. citizen, and only \n10  then, after they provide notice and an opportunity to provide POC. Further, HB 2243 states \n11  that the county recorder “shall send a notice … that the person’s registration has been \n12  canceled, the reason for cancellation, the qualifications of electors pursuant to section 16-\n13  101 and instructions on registering to vote if the person is qualified.” HB 2243 § 10(K).  \n  \n14  LEGAL STANDARD \n15  Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and/or for the failure \n16  to state a claim. “The burden of establishing ripeness and standing rests on the party \n17  asserting the claim.” Colwell v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 558 F.3d 1112, 1121 (9th \n18  Cir. 2009). \n19  On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain sufficient \n20  factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” \n21  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted). A complaint must contain \n22  “enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of \n23  illegal” conduct. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007).  \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  8 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 22 of 46\n \n \n1  ARGUMENT \n2  I.  SOME OF PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE NON-JUSTICIABLE \n3  A.  Private Plaintiffs Lack Article III Standing \n4  To establish standing, a plaintiff “must show [(1)] that [it] is under threat of \n5  suffering ‘injury in fact’ that is concrete and particularized; the threat must be actual and \n6  imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; [(2)] it must be fairly traceable to the challenged \n7  action of the defendant; and [(3)] it must be likely that a favorable judicial decision will \n8  prevent or redress the injury.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) \n9  (citation omitted). Private Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege standing here. \n10  1.  Private Plaintiffs Cannot Rely On Representational Standing \n11 \nNone of the named plaintiffs here are actual voters—only organizations. And while \n12 \nthose organizations attempt to rely on harms to their members, who are actual or potential \n13 \n   voters, those attempts are unavailing.  \n14 \nTo establish such representational standing, Plaintiffs must “identify members who \n15 \nhave suffered the requisite harm.” Id. at 499. Private Plaintiffs thus were required “to make \n16 \nspecific allegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would \n17 \nsuffer harm.” Id. (emphasis added). But not one of the Private Plaintiffs even attempts to \n18 \nname individual affected members. \n19 \nThe Supreme Court has further held that “[t]his requirement of naming the affected \n20 \nmembers has never been dispensed with in light of statistical probabilities, but only where \n21 \nall the members of the organization are affected by the challenged activity.” Id. at 498-99 \n22 \n(first emphasis added). No Private Plaintiff alleges that all of its members are affected by \n23 \nHB 2492 or 2243. Instead, they rely on precisely the sort of “statistical probabilities” that \n24 \nare “never” sufficient. Id. For example, DNC argues (at ¶15) that “it is extremely likely \n25 \nthat one or more members of ADP[] will be removed from the rolls because of HB2492.” \n26 \nSimilarly,  LUCHA  argues  (at  ¶212)  that  its  members  are  “more  likely  to  lack  the \n27 \nrequirement documentation under HB 2492.” This is precisely the sort of “statistical \n28 \n  9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 23 of 46\n \n \n1  probabilities” that Summers makes plain does not suffice. 555 U.S. at 498-99. All Private \n2  Plaintiffs thus lack representational standing. \n3  2.  Private Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged Organizational \nStanding Either  \n4 \n5  An organization may establish an injury-in-fact when it suffers “both a diversion of \n6  its resources and a frustration of its mission,” but it may not “manufacture the injury” by \n7  “simply choosing to spend money fixing a problem.” La Asociacion de Trabajadores de \n8  Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010). Instead, the \n9  plaintiff organization “must … show that it would have suffered some other injury if it had \n10  not  diverted  resources  to  counteracting  the  problem.”  Id.  No  Private  Plaintiff  here \n11  adequately alleges such a cognizable diversion of resources, however. \n12  In particular, no Plaintiff identifies “any specific projects that [they] had to put on \n13  hold or otherwise curtail in order to respond to the” law it challenges. See NAACP v. City \n  \n14  of Kyle, 626 F.3d 233, 238-39 (5th Cir. 2010). Additionally, Plaintiffs must show that they \n15  are actually changing their allocation of resources, not going about “business as usual,” \n16  Friends of the Earth v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., 992 F.3d 939, 942-43 (9th Cir. 2021)—\n17  which is what the vast majority of purported diversions amount to.  \n18  For example, Poder Latinx alleges that it will be forced to hire an additional \n19  employee and AAANHPI alleges it decreased its voter registration goal, which purportedly \n20  caused it to lose approximately $50,000 in funding. But standing requires an injury that is \n21  “fairly traceable” to the challenged conduct, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n22  560 (1992), and decisions to hire an additional employee or reduce voter registration goals, \n23  which putatively caused some third party to reduce funding, are not fairly traceable to the \n24  new  legislation  (and  often  self-inflicted).  Lake  Forest,  624  F.3d  at  1088  n.4  (“An \n25  organization may sue only if it was forced to choose between suffering an injury and \n26  diverting resources to counteract the injury.”); Rodriguez v. City of San Jose, 930 F.3d \n27  1123, 1136 (9th Cir. 2019) (must find the issue “requires” diverting resources).  \n28 \n  10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 24 of 46\n \n \n1  Nor do Plaintiffs “explain[] what activities [that they] would divert resources away \n2  from in order to spend additional resources on combatting the [alleged harms].” Jacobson \n3  v.  Fla.  Sec’y  of  State,  974  F.3d  1236,  1250  (11th  Cir.  2020).  That  too  is  fatal  for \n4  organizational standing. Id. Because no Private Plaintiff has alleged what their resources \n5  were diverted away from—let alone what harms were thereby caused by the diversion—\n6  none has adequately alleged organizational standing. Instead, Plaintiffs have at most \n7  alleged “simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests,” which does not \n8  suffice. Havens, 455 U.S. at 379. That is particularly true here as Plaintiffs’ “abstract social \n9  interest in maximizing voter turnout … cannot confer Article III standing.” Fair Elections \n10  Ohio v. Husted, 770 F.3d 456, 461 (6th Cir. 2014).  \n11  3.  Several Plaintiffs Lack Article III Traceability & Redressability \n12  Finally, several Private Plaintiffs lack standing because their failures to join County \n13  Recorders precludes them from establishing Article III traceability and redressability. All \n  \n14  of the challenged provisions of HB 2492 and 2243 are implemented and enforced by the \n15  County Recorders—not the Secretary of State or Attorney General (neither of whom can \n16  register or de-register anyone). Here, as in Jacobson, “any injury would be traceable only \n17  to [the County election officials] and redressable only by relief against them.” 974 F.3d at \n18  1253. \n19  Mecinas v. Hobbs, 30 F.4th 890 (9th Cir. 2022) is not to the contrary. There, the \n20  Ninth Circuit held that a claim asserted solely against the Secretary was redressable \n21  because the Secretary promulgates the Election Procedure Manual [EPM], which the \n22  County Recorders are “bound to follow.” Id. at 900. But unlike ballot order, registration \n23  procedures are not a proper subject for the EPM, and their inclusion in such would be \n24  improper and not bind the County Recorders. See, e.g., Leach v. Hobbs, 250 Ariz. 572, \n25  576 (2021) (“[A]n EPM regulation that exceeds the scope of its statutory authorization or \n26  contravenes an election statute’s purpose does not have the force of law.”); A.R.S. § 16-\n27  452  (establishing  proper  subjects  for  EPM,  which  does  not  include  registration \n28 \n  11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 25 of 46\n \n \n1  procedures). \n2  Neither  LUCHA  nor  DNC  names  any  County  Recorders,  and  Poder  Latinx \n3  curiously names only one. Their complaints should therefore be dismissed for failure to \n4  allege Article III traceability and redressability standing requirements. Alternatively, even \n5  if not an Article III violation, such failure to name County Recorders violates Rule 19 and \n6  those Private Plaintiffs should be compelled to join such Defendants or have their suits \n7  dismissed for failure to name indispensable parties. \n8  B.  Many Claims Here Are Unripe \n9  Several claims here are also not justiciable because they are not ripe for decision, \n10  either as a matter of Article III or prudential ripeness. In particular, (1) Private Plaintiffs’ \n11  challenges to the Citizenship Question and Birthplace Requirements lack any genuine \n12  threat of imminent enforcement, and (2) Private Plaintiffs’ Database and Investigation \n13  Requirement Allegations and VRA § 2 claims are prudentially unripe as they depend \n  \n14  enormously on speculation and supposition, without any actual implementation data that \n15  could validate or refute that speculation.  \n16  1.  Plaintiffs Face No “Genuine Threat Of Imminent Prosecution” \n17  For constitutional ripeness, “neither the mere existence of a proscriptive statute nor \n18  a  generalized  threat  of  prosecution  satisfies  the  ‘case  or  controversy’  requirement.” \n19  Thomas,  220  F.3d  at  1139.  “Rather,  there  must  be  a  ‘genuine  threat  of  imminent \n20  prosecution.’” Id. (citation omitted). “In evaluating the genuineness of a claimed threat of \n21  prosecution, [courts] look to whether the plaintiffs have articulated a ‘concrete plan’ to \n22  violate the law in question, whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a \n23  specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings, and the history of past prosecution or \n24  enforcement under the challenged statute.” Id. (citation omitted). \n25  Private  Plaintiffs  notably  do  not  allege  that  anyone  has  a  “concrete  plan”  to \n26  complete State Forms without checking the Citizenship Question box or filling in the \n27  Birthplace Requirement field. Plaintiffs thus have not alleged any “genuine threat of \n28 \n  12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 26 of 46\n \n \n1  imminent” enforcement of either such requirement against any Private Plaintiff or their \n2  members. \n3  2.  Many Of Plaintiffs’ Claims Lack Prudential Ripeness \n4  Some of Plaintiffs’ claims also lack prudential ripeness. “[A] claim is not ripe for \n5  adjudication when it rests upon ‘contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, \n6  or indeed may not occur at all.’” Texas, 523 U.S. at 300 (citation omitted). In evaluating \n7  prudential ripeness, this Court looks to “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and \n8  the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.” Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1141 \n9  (citation omitted). \n10  Here,  Private  Plaintiffs’  allegations  that  errors  or  outdated  data  in  databases \n11  (“Database Allegations”) would thwart efforts to register to vote are entirely speculative \n12  and lacking in any actual real-world implementation data. See, e.g., LUCHA FAC ¶93. \n13  Similarly, Plaintiffs’ fears that anyone would be wrongfully investigated because of the \n  \n14  Acts, or wrongly removed because of bad faith complaints/implementation, is entirely \n15  speculative.  Such  hypothetical  issues  are  not  currently  fit  for  review  and  would  be \n16  appropriately  raised  by  as-applied  challenges  involving  concrete  denials,  rather  than \n17  postulated  effects  of  the  quality  of  database  data.  As  Justice  Stevens  explained,  by \n18  deferring adjudication, this Court can “enhance the likelihood [the claims] will be resolved \n19  correctly on the basis of historical facts rather than speculation.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 \n20  U.S. 1, 6 (2006) (Stevens, J., concurring). \n21  Similarly, LUCHA’s VRA § 2 claim depends enormously on speculated racial \n22  disparate impacts—which necessarily are pure conjecture since the Acts have never been \n23  implemented. Such conjectural disparities rest upon “‘contingent future events that may \n24  not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” Texas, 523 U.S. at 300 (quotation \n25  marks omitted).  \n26  These  issues  are  thus  not  fit  for  review.  Because  Private  Plaintiffs’  relevant \n27  allegations are no more than speculation, they similarly have not established meaningful \n28 \n  13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 27 of 46\n \n \n1  hardship from withholding judicial review until actual implementation data exists. \n2  II.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT PLED VIABLE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS  \n3  Private Plaintiffs assert a variety of constitutional claims under Anderson-Burdick \n4  doctrine, procedural due process, and the Equal Protection Clause. None are viably pled. \n5  A.  Plaintiffs’ Anderson-Burdick Claims Fail \n6  Four  Plaintiffs  assert  unconstitutional  burden  claims  under  Anderson-Burdick \n7  doctrine (all Private Plaintiffs save Poder Latinx). Those claims fail because the burdens \n8  involved are not significant (and often minimal) and justified by the State’s compelling \n9  interests. \n10  1.  Overview of Anderson-Burdick Doctrine \n11  Challenges to electoral statutes and regulations that allege an unconstitutional \n12  burden are governed by the Anderson-Burdick framework. That framework recognizes that \n13  “‘States may, and inevitably must, enact reasonable regulations of parties, elections, and \n  \n14  ballots to reduce election—and campaign-related disorder.’” Prete v. Bradbury, 438 F.3d \n15  949, 961 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, \n16  358 (1997)). \n17  Under the Anderson-Burdick framework, “an election regulation that imposes a \n18  severe burden is subject to strict scrutiny.” Nader v. Brewer, 531 F.3d 1028, 1035 (9th Cir. \n19  2008). In contrast, ‘“[l]esser burdens trigger less exacting review, and a State’s important \n20  regulatory  interests  will  usually  be  enough  to  justify  reasonable,  nondiscriminatory \n21  restrictions.”’ Angle v. Miller, 673 F.3d 1122, 1132 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Prete, 438 \n22  F.3d at 961) (cleaned up). Notably, “voting regulations are rarely subjected to strict \n23  scrutiny.” Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1106 (9th Cir. 2011). Moreover, “[e]laborate, \n24  empirical verification of weightiness is not required.” Timmons, 520 U.S. at 352. \n25  2.  The Burdens Here Are Not Substantial \n26  The burden imposed by the Citizenship Questionnaire and Birthplace Requirement \n27  are minimal at most, since all competent voters know such information and can readily \n28 \n  14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 28 of 46\n \n \n1  check a box or write their birthplace. Any burden is certainly far less than completing an \n2  application for a mail-in ballot, which the Ninth Circuit has held imposes only “an \n3  extremely small” burden “to the extent that [it] … could be viewed as a burden” at all. \n4  Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 677 (9th Cir. 2018). The burden here is thus less-than-\n5  extremely-small, if cognizable at all. \n6  Similarly, the burden imposed by the POC and POR requirements are not severe \n7  under Crawford. There, the Supreme Court upheld a voter ID requirement for in-person \n8  voting against an Anderson-Burdick challenge, explaining that “the inconvenience of \n9  making a trip to the BMV, gathering the required documents, and posing for a photograph \n10  surely does not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote.” Crawford, 553 U.S. \n11  at 198 (emphasis added) (plurality opinion); accord id. at 204 (Scalia, J., concurring joined \n12  by Thomas and Alito, JJ.) (“[T]he burden at issue is minimal and justified”).  \n13  Notably, the POR requirement can be satisfied by presenting either a photo ID with \n  \n14  address listed (including drivers’ licenses and state identification cards) or documents like \n15  utility bills or tribal enrollment card. The burden is thus the same or smaller than in \n16  Crawford.  \n17  Similarly, the POC requirement is no more burdensome than in Crawford. Indeed, \n18  it is perhaps significantly less so, since POC need only be provided once, when a voter \n19  registers to vote—unlike the Crawford photo ID requirement, which must be presented \n20  every time a voter wished to cast a ballot. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 185. \n21  The Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Gonzalez likewise confirms that the burden \n22  here is not severe (and that HB 2492 and 2243 are constitutional). There, the Ninth Circuit \n23  upheld an Arizona law that required producing documents that “may require payment of a \n24  fee” against an Anderson-Burdick challenge. Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 409-10. As the court \n25  recognized, “any payment associated with obtaining the documents required … is related \n26  to the state’s legitimate interest in assessing the eligibility and qualifications of voters, the \n27  photo identification requirement is not an invidious restriction under Harper, and the \n28 \n  15 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 29 of 46\n \n \n1  burden is minimal under Crawford.” Id. at 410 (emphasis added). \n2  3.  The State’s Interests In Securing Its Elections Suffices \n3  Because the Acts do not impose a “severe burden” under the Anderson-Burdick \n4  framework, this Court’s inquiry into the constitutionality of the Acts “is limited to whether \n5  the chosen method is reasonably related to [an] important regulatory interest.” Prete, 438 \n6  F.3d at 971. Anderson/Burdick treats the State’s interests as a “legislative fact.” Frank v. \n7  Walker, 768 F.3d 744, 750 (7th Cir. 2014). States need not submit “any record evidence \n8  in support of” their interests. Common Cause/Ga. v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1353 (11th \n9  Cir. 2009); Greater Birmingham Ministries v. Sec’y of State for State of Ala., 992 F.3d \n10  1299, 1334 (11th Cir. 2021). States can rely on “post hoc rationalizations,” can “come up \n11  with [their] justifications at any time,” and have no “limit[s]” on the type of “record [they] \n12  can build in order to justify a burden placed on the right to vote.” Mays v. LaRose, 951 \n13  F.3d 775, 789 (6th Cir. 2020). Here, the State’s interests in reducing administrative \n  \n14  burdens and in securing its elections easily satisfies this standard. \n15  As in Crawford, the State’s interest in securing its elections and maintaining voter \n16  confidence  easily  sustains  these  not-severe  (and  often  minimal-at-most)  burdens. \n17  Crawford, 553 U.S. at 194-97 (plurality opinion); id. at 209 (Scalia, J., concurring in the \n18  judgment); see also Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 409-10. Indeed, HB 2492 and 2243 are even \n19  more narrowly tailored than in Crawford, since voters need only produce POC and POR \n20  once, rather than every time they seek to vote. \n21  B.  Freestanding Procedural Due Process Claims Are Barred \n22  Several Plaintiffs (Mi Familia et al., Poder Latinx, DNC et al., and AAANHPI) \n23  attempt to assert freestanding procedural due process claims in addition to their Anderson-\n24  Burdick claims. Those attempts are squarely foreclosed by Ninth Circuit precedent. “[A] \n25  single analytic framework” governs constitutional challenges to the burdens imposed by \n26  electoral regulations. Dudum, 640 F.3d at 1106 n.15. For such claims, “each is folded into \n27  the Anderson/Burdick inquiry.” Soltysik v. Padilla, 910 F.3d 438, 449 n.7 (9th Cir. 2018). \n28 \n  16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 30 of 46\n \n \n1  The Ninth Circuit has specifically applied this rule to procedural due process claims: “the \n2  Anderson/Burdick framework applies to Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim” and \n3  controls even if “the Eldridge test would strike a different balance.” Hobbs III, 18 F.4th at \n4  1195. \n5  DNC rather outrageously cites (at 15 n.8) Arizona Democratic Party v. Hobbs \n6  (“Hobbs  I”),  485  F.Supp.3d  1073,  1093  (D.  Ariz.  2020),  for  the  proposition  that \n7  “[m]ulitple district courts … have considered procedural due process challenges to election \n8  regulations under ordinary procedural due process principles[.]” DNC neglects to mention \n9  Hobbs I’s subsequent history: the Ninth Circuit expressly reversed that precise holding in \n10  Hobbs III, 18 F.4th at 1194-95—an omission all the more indefensible as the DNC group \n11  includes Plaintiff Arizona Democratic Party, who lost this precise issue in Hobbs III. \n12  Because all of these putative due process claims are governed by the Anderson-\n13  Burdick framework rather than Matthews, these claims add nothing and can be readily \n  \n14  rejected as duplicative/superfluous, as the Ninth Circuit did in Hobbs III. \n15  Moreover, those claims additionally fail because Plaintiffs lack a cognizable liberty \n16  interest in voting without providing POC, POR, or a place of birth. “A liberty interest may \n17  arise from either of two sources: the due process clause itself or state law.” Carver v. \n18  Lehman, 558 F.3d 869, 872 (9th Cir. 2009). No Plaintiff claims any such liberty interest \n19  arises under the Due Process Clause itself. And state law, by affirmatively requiring \n20  POC/POR etc., necessarily does use the “explicitly mandatory language” that might give \n21  rise to a liberty interest in voting without meeting such requirements. Mendoza v. Blodgett, \n22  960 F.2d 1425, 1428-29 (9th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted). \n23  C.  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Claims Fail \n24  1.  Plaintiffs’ Disparate Treatment Claims Fail \n25  As an initial matter, Plaintiffs’ equal protection challenges to the burdens imposed \n26  by  HB  2492  and  2243  fail  because  such  claims  are  properly  considered  under  the \n27  Anderson-Burdick framework and thus lack merit as discussed above. Supra § II.A, B; \n28 \n  17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 31 of 46\n \n \n1  Dudum,  640  F.3d  at  1106  n.15  (“[A]  single  analytic  framework”  governs  “First \n2  Amendment, Due Process, or Equal Protection claims” challenging electoral burdens); \n3  Hobbs III, 18 F.4th at 1194-95. \n4  But  even  if  considered  under  the  traditional  standards,  an  equal-protection \n5  discriminatory  treatment  claim  requires  differential  treatment  based  on  some \n6  classification. See Freeman v. City of Santa Ana, 68 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir. 1995) (“The \n7  first step in equal protection analysis is to identify the [defendants’] classification of \n8  groups.”) (cleaned up) (citation omitted); accord Commonwealth of Northern Mariana \n9  Islands v. Zhen, 68 F. App’x 7, 8 (9th Cir. 2003). A plaintiff can only establish an equal \n10  protection discriminatory treatment claim if it shows the law is facially discriminatory. See \n11  Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 271-73 (1979).  \n12  With respect to Plaintiffs’ national-origin and race-based claims,5 HB 2243 and \n13  2492 are not facially discriminatory whatsoever. Both statutes require all persons—no \n  \n14  matter their race or national origin—to provide POC and POR and satisfy the other \n15  statutory requirements. They are completely neutral as a facial matter. Instead, each applies \n16  when one registers to vote (HB 2492) or a county recorder receives information that a \n17  registered voter is not a U.S. citizen (HB 2243). And Plaintiffs’ attempts to rely on \n18  disparate impacts do not suffice to establish a discriminatory treatment claim. See, e.g., \n19  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. \n20  As  to  Plaintiffs’  Federal-Form  vs.  State-Form  classification  claims,  such \n21  classifications are not suspect classes. Such claims are therefore only subject to rational-\n22  basis review. See McDonald v. Board of Election Comm’rs, 394 U.S. 802, 806 (1969). \n23  And here a rational basis is readily apparent: because those using the State Form are \n24  required to provide POC and POR, the State can be substantially more confident that the \n25  voters are indeed U.S. citizens and reside in the districts in which they intend to cast a \n26 \n27   \n5  AAANHPI’s Fifteenth Amendment claim fails for these same reasons as the same \n28  standard applies. City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 63-65, 95, 101-03 (1980). \n  18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 32 of 46\n \n \n1  vote.6 Indeed, the Supreme Court has acknowledged this interest. See Inter Tribal, 570 \n2  U.S. at 12-13 (explaining that in addition to using the Federal Form, States may create \n3  their  own  state-specific  voter  registration  forms  that  require  additional  information). \n4  Arizona has a legitimate interest in enforcing voter qualifications, and to effectuate that \n5  interest  Arizona  may  rationally  require  State  Form  applicants  to  submit  additional \n6  information, including information as prescribed by HB 2492. Indeed, if a bare attestation \n7  were sufficient to establish a fact conclusively, there would be no need for the IRS to audit \n8  any taxpayer that certified that their tax returns were correct. But the federal government \n9  does not always take taxpayers at their word, and often demands documentary proof (such \n10  as W-2 forms). The State equally has a rational basis in insisting upon POC and POR. \n11  More  generally,  HB  2243  and  2492  were  enacted  to  combat  voter  fraud  and \n12  safeguard voter confidence in Arizona elections by ensuring all voters are U.S. citizens \n13  that are eligible to vote. See, e.g., Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 208-09 (1992); Eu v. \n  \n14  San Francisco Cnty. Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 231 (1989); Gonzalez, 677 \n15  F.3d at 410 (9th Cir. 2012). The statutes plainly advance those interests. Facially neutral \n16  legislation that rationally furthers legitimate government purposes—without more—does \n17  not violate the Equal Protection Clause. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 246 \n18  (1976) (holding equal protection claim challenging mandated police officer test failed \n19  where test was “neutral on its face and rationally may be said to serve a purpose the \n20  Government is constitutionally empowered to pursue”); De Martinez v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d \n21  759, 764 (9th Cir. 2004) (“A legislative classification must be wholly irrational to violate \n22  equal protection.”); McDonald, 394 U.S. at 809 (“[S]tatutory classifications will be set \n23  aside only if no grounds can be conceived to justify them”). \n24 \n \n25  6  Similarly, the Citizenship Question and Birthplace requirements serve rational bases, as \nthey assist the State in ascertaining citizenship (particularly as the Fourteenth Amendment \n26 \nestablishes birthplace citizenship) and further assist in any necessary prosecutions for \nfraudulent registration forms: while a would-be registrant might disclaim mens rea for \n27 \nperjury, such denials are less plausible if the would-be voters have also specifically \n28  checked that they are U.S. citizens and/or supplied false birthplaces. \n  19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 33 of 46\n \n \n1  Finally, the State has a rational interest in complying with federal law but exercising \n2  its own sovereign choices where it is not preempted by federal law. The Acts follow these \n3  distinctions, particularly as Congress lacks authority to regulate state and presidential \n4  elector elections. See infra § III.A. \n5  2.  Plaintiffs’ Discriminatory Intent Claims Likewise Fail \n6  Plaintiffs also have not sufficiently alleged a discriminatory purpose underlying HB \n7  2492 or HB 2243. See Davis, 426 U.S. at 246 (rejecting equal protection claim for police \n8  officer test that had a disparate impact because the plaintiffs failed to establish that the test \n9  had a discriminatory purpose); see also Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. \n10  Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-65 (1977) (holding that disparate impact alone is insufficient; \n11  “[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the \n12  Equal Protection Clause”). \n13  In Lee v. City of Los Angeles, the Ninth Circuit affirmed dismissal of the plaintiffs’ \n  \n14  equal protection claim because they pleaded only conclusory allegations of discriminatory \n15  intent.  250  F.3d  668,  686-87  (9th  Cir.  2001).  “Discriminatory  purpose,”  the  court \n16  explained, “implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It \n17  implies that the decisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at \n18  least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable \n19  group.” Id. (quoting Navarro v. Block, 72 F.3d 712, 716 n.5 (9th Cir. 1995)). This Court \n20  has likewise dismissed an equal protection claim based on disenfranchisement of certain \n21  Arizona residents because plaintiffs did not plead sufficient allegations of discriminatory \n22  purpose. Coronado v. Napolitano, No. CV 07-1089-PHX-SMM, 2008 WL 4838707, at *4 \n23  (D. Ariz. Nov. 6, 2008). \n24  Here, Plaintiffs fail to allege any discriminatory purpose—certainly any that would \n25  comport with the Iqbal pleading standard. See McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., \n26  No. 08 C 6105, 2011 WL 1196859, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 29, 2011) (“In short, plaintiffs \n27  allege that the system was designed with discriminatory intent, but under Iqbal they must \n28 \n  20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 34 of 46\n \n \n1  do more. They must plead sufficient factual matter to show that defendants adopted and \n2  implemented  the  retention  system  not  for  a  neutral  reason,  but  for  the  purpose  of \n3  discriminating against African-American [Financial Advisors].”). \n4  At best, Plaintiffs contend that because they believe that voter fraud is not an issue \n5  in  Arizona,  this  Court  should  infer  that  the  Arizona  Legislature  “must  have  had  a \n6  discriminatory intent” in passing laws designed to prohibit voter fraud. But “because a \n7  government  has  such  a  compelling  interest  in  securing  the  right  to  vote  freely  and \n8  effectively, th[e] Court never has held a State ‘to the burden of demonstrating empirically \n9  the objective effects on political stability that [are] produced’ by the voting regulation in \n10  question.” Burson, 504 U.S. at 208-09 (citation omitted).  \n11  Plaintiffs’ discriminatory intent claims further have not supplied non-conclusory \n12  allegations that could overcome the presumption of good faith owed to Arizona legislators. \n13  “Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the \n  \n14  burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State.” Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, \n15  2324 (2018). Although legislative decisions are not immune from review, courts must \n16  afford state legislatures a presumption of good faith. Id. at 2324; Fusilier v. Landry, 963 \n17  F.3d 447, 464 (5th Cir. 2020). “Only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the \n18  unconstitutionality  of  a  statute  on  [the]  ground  [of  improper  legislative  motive.]” \n19  Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 617 (1960). In satisfying that burden, Plaintiffs may \n20  put forward both direct and circumstantial evidence of illegitimate intent. Abbott, 138 S. \n21  Ct. at 2327.  \n22  Plaintiffs  say  a  lot  in  their  complaints,  but  virtually  nothing  they  say  bears \n23  meaningfully on the key question here—whether the legislature had an illegitimate intent \n24  that motivated its enactments. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 680-81 (claim of racial discrimination \n25  not adequately plead where allegations recite in a conclusory manner the elements of the \n26  claim and allege a mere knowledge of disparate impact, “given more likely explanations”); \n27  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57 (allegations of parallel conduct and conclusory assertion of \n28 \n  21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 35 of 46\n \n \n1  agreement not enough to show antitrust violation when parallel conduct could “just as well \n2  be independent action”). Plaintiffs’ discriminatory intent claims should thus be dismissed. \n3  III.  PLAINTIFFS FAIILED TO STATE VIABLE NVRA CLAIMS \n4  Plaintiffs allege a range of violations of the NVRA, citing various sections of the \n5  statute in support of their claims. Almost all their claims fail for one simple reason: the \n6  NVRA does not cover registration for any of the elections regulated by the Acts. The Acts \n7  regulate only state and presidential elections. See HB 2492 § 5; A.R.S. § 16-127(a)(1). But \n8  the NVRA explicitly does not apply to state elections, and it cannot constitutionally apply \n9  to presidential elections. The Acts and the NVRA therefore do not conflict. \n10  A.  The NVRA Does Not Apply To State or Presidential Elections \n11  Congress enacted the NVRA as an exercise of its power under the Elections Clause \n12  of Article I. Inter Tribal Council, 570 U.S. at 7-8; Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now \n13  v. Miller, 129 F.3d 833, 836-37 (6th Cir. 1997) (upholding power of Congress to enact the \n  \n14  NVRA under the Elections Clause). That clause reads in full:  \n15  The  Times,  Places  and  Manner  of  holding  Elections  for  Senators  and \nRepresentatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; \n16  but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, \nexcept as to the places of chusing Senators. \n17 \n18  U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. The Framers’ decision to specify “Senators and \n19  Representatives” in this clause, as opposed to all federal elections, was no accident. A \n20  different clause provides that electors for President and Vice President shall be appointed \n21  “in such manner as the Legislature [of each state] may direct.” Id. art II, § 1, cl. 2.  \n22  Unlike Congressional elections, where Congress may regulate “Times, Places, and \n23  Manner,” for selection/election of Presidential electors, “Congress may [only] determine \n24  the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes,” id. \n25  art II, § 1, cl. 4. Article II thus conspicuously excludes any Congressional power over \n26  “Places and Manner” of presidential elections. See, e.g., Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 \n27  U.S. 438, 452 (2002) (“[W]hen [drafters] includes particular language in one section of a \n28 \n  22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 36 of 46\n \n \n1  statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that [the \n2  drafters] act[ed] intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”); \n3  accord Christensen v. Harris Cty., 529 U.S. 576, 583 (2000) (“When a statute limits a \n4  thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes a negative of any other mode.” (cleaned \n5  up)); Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 844 (2018). Article II also notably excludes \n6  Congress from the selection of presidential electors, by providing that “no Senator or \n7  Representative ... shall be appointed an elector.” Id. \n8  The NVRA thus can apply constitutionally only to “Elections for Senators and \n9  Representatives.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. It may apply on its face to “elections for \n10  Federal office,” generally. See 52 U.S.C. §§ 20501(b)(1), 20503(a). And it may purport to \n11  include presidential elections within its reach. See id. §§ 20502(2), 30101(3). But the \n12  Constitution does not permit such an arrangement. Instead, states in our federalist system \n13  run their own elections. Congress can modify state regulations by regulating “Places and \n  \n14  Manner,” but only for federal congressional elections, U.S. Const., art. I, §4.  \n15  Because  extending  the  NVRA  to  Presidential  elections  would  violate  the \n16  Constitution, “[i]t is ... incumbent upon [courts] to read the statute to eliminate those \n17  [constitutional] doubts so long as such a reading is not plainly contrary to the intent of [the \n18  enacting legislature].” United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 78 (1994). \n19  This Court can readily do so by reading the NVRA to apply only to Congressional \n20  elections. But if that reading is not textually permissible, any extension of the NVRA to \n21  state or presidential elections plainly exceeds Congress’s powers under Articles I and II.7 \n22   \n7  The NVRA is plainly an exercise of Congress’s power under the Article I Election \n23 \nClause, and not § 5 and §2 of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, respectively. \nThat much is clear from the NVRA’s limitation to federal elections and lack of detailed \n24 \nfindings that would suggest that Congress intended to exercise its authority under the \n25  Reconstruction Amendments. But even if the NVRA was deemed to be an attempt exercise \nauthority under those constitutional provisions, the NVRA would then run afoul of the \n26 \nrequirement of “congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or \nremedied and the means adopted to that end.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 \n27 \n(1997); accord Shelby Cty. v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 542 n.1 (2013). Nw. Austin Mun. Util. \n28  Dist. No. 1 v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 204 (2009). \n  23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 37 of 46\n \n \n1  B.  All Plaintiffs’ NVRA Claims Fail as a Matter of Law \n2  Any supposed conflict between the Acts and the NVRA evaporates under a correct \n3  understanding of the NVRA’s reach. The Acts govern registration only for state and \n4  presidential elections. Because the NVRA governs only federal congressional elections, as \n5  explained, supra § III.A, it therefore cannot preempt either Act. In particular, Plaintiffs’ \n6  common complaint that States must “accept and use the mail voter registration application \n7  form” promulgated under the NVRA has no bearing here. See 52 U.S.C. § 20505(a); MFV-\n8  Cmpt. ¶94; LUCHA-Cmpt. ¶352; USA-Cmpt. ¶63; DNC-Cmpt. ¶70. The NVRA only \n9  imposes this requirement on “registration of voters in elections for Federal office,” which \n10  excludes presidential elections. 52 U.S.C. § 20505(a). The Acts do nothing to the contrary.  \n11  Other claims suffer from additional flaws. Plaintiffs argue the NVRA requires \n12  registration  at  motor  vehicle  agencies,  public-assistance  agencies  and  other  NVRA-\n13  mandated agencies, 52 U.S.C. §§ 20504, 20506; LUCHA-Cmpt. ¶353-54. But Arizona \n  \n14  continues to comply with these provisions by providing registration to vote in federal \n15  congressional elections with the Federal Form at the required agencies. Indeed, Arizona \n16  continues under the Acts to incorporate the NVRA’s requirements into its provision for \n17  registration with a driver’s license application. See HB 2492 § (2)(B)(4); A.R.S. § 16-\n18  112(2)(b)(4). Plaintiffs also charge the State defendants with failing to accept timely-\n19  received registration applications. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1); MFV-Cmpt. ¶95; LUCHA-\n20  Cmpt. ¶355. But the Acts do not change the timing rules for accepting applications or say \n21  anything about refusing timely applications.  \n22  The DNC further argues that the Act allows removal of voters from the rolls shortly \n23  before election, as forbidden by § 20507(c)(2)(A); DNC-Cmpt. ¶85. But nothing in the \n24  Acts provides for removal of voters from the rolls immediately before an election, federal \n25  or otherwise. The DNC rather seizes on the silence of the Acts to construct a hypothetical \n26  scenario in which ineligible voters are removed from the rolls near an election, in violation \n27 \n28 \n  24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 38 of 46\n \n \n1  of the NVRA but not of the Acts. But the Acts are not preempted simply because they fail \n2  to prohibit everything the NVRA prohibits.  \n3  Finally,  Private  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Acts  violate  the  requirement  of \n4  § 20507(b)(1) that any program to maintain accurate voter rolls must be “uniform and \n5  nondiscriminatory.” LUCHA FAC ¶356; DNC-Cmpt. ¶74; Poder Latinx FAC ¶87. But \n6  requiring proof of citizenship as a condition for registration or voting by mail is not \n7  discriminatory. Nor is removal from the rolls of voters determined not be citizens.  \n8  IV.  PLAINTIFFS’ SECTION 10101 CLAIMS FAIL \n9  The federal materiality statute forbids any “person acting under color of law” from:  \n10  Deny[ing] the right of any individual to vote in any election because of an \nerror  or  omission  on  any  record  or  paper  relating  to  any  application, \n11  registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not \nmaterial in determining whether such individual is qualified under State law \n12 \nto vote in such election. \n13  52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B). The same statute also forbids the application of “any \n  \n14  standard, practice, or procedure different from [those] applied ... to other individuals within \n15  the same county, parish, or similar political subdivision.” Id. § 10101(a)(2)(a). Private \n16  Plaintiffs have no cause of action to sue under this statute, and neither Private Plaintiffs \n17  nor the United States plausibly allege that the Acts violate it.  \n18  A.  Private Plaintiffs Lack A Cause Of Action Under Section 10101 \n19  Private Plaintiffs’ Section 10101 claims fail at the threshold because they lack a \n20  private right of action to enforce that provision. Plaintiffs will cite 42 U.S.C. § 1983, but \n21  § 1983 is not available if Congress “did not intend that remedy” for the statutory right in \n22  question. City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005). For the \n23  materiality statute, Congress included a public judicial remedy for “the [U.S.] Attorney \n24  General” alone. 52 U.S.C. § 10101(c). That remedy is contained in the same statute and is \n25  highly detailed—dictating who can be the defendant, creating special forms of relief, \n26  articulating  rebuttable  evidentiary  presumptions,  creating  new  federal  jurisdiction, \n27  eliminating  exhaustion  requirements,  appointing  and  compensating  private  referees, \n28 \n  25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 39 of 46\n \n \n1  specifying fast deadlines, assigning counsel to defendants, and creating jurisdiction for \n2  three-judge  district  courts  and  direct  appeals  to  this  Court.  See  §  10101(c)-(g).  The \n3  “‘express  provision  of  one  method  of  enforcing  a  substantive  rule,’”  especially  a \n4  “‘comprehensive enforcement scheme’” like this one, “‘suggests that Congress intended \n5  to preclude others.’” Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 120-21 (citations omitted). Hence \n6  “the majority of courts” hold that the materiality statute “is only enforceable by the United \n7  States  in  an  action  brought  by  the  Attorney  General.” Hayden  v.  Pataki,  2004  WL \n8  1335921, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, 2004); accord Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. \n9  Husted, 837 F.3d 612, 630 (6th Cir. 2016); Dekom v. New York, 2013 WL 3095010, at *18 \n10  (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2013) (collecting cases), aff’d, 583 F. App’x 15 (2d Cir. 2014). \n11  B.  Plaintiffs Fail To Allege Violations Of Section 10101 \n12  1. On the merits, Plaintiffs’ claims fail right out of the gate because they contest the \n13  validity of a State law, when “State law” is the standard against which any denial is \n  \n14  measured. The materiality statute governs ad hoc executive actions that exceed state law, \n15  without dictating the substance of state law itself. Because the statute asks whether an error \n16  or omission was material “under State law,” Plaintiffs must allege that the defendant went \n17  beyond state law. See, e.g., Org. for Black Struggle v. Ashcroft, 493 F. Supp. 3d 790, 803 \n18  (W.D. Mo. 2020) (holding officials “may reject applications and ballots that do not clearly \n19  indicate the required information required by Missouri statute without offending 52 U.S.C. \n20  § 10101(a)(2)(B)”); Martin v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1302, 1308-09 (N.D. Ga. 2018) \n21  (holding that an election practice violated the materiality statute where it was not required \n22  by “Georgia law”). As members of Congress explained at the time the statute was passed, \n23  Congress’s concerns “c[a]me not from discriminatory laws,” but “‘from the discriminatory \n24  application and administration of apparently nondiscriminatory laws.’” H.R. Rep. No. 88-\n25  914 (Nov. 20, 1963), 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2391, 2491 (emphasis added).  \n26  Here,  of  course,  Plaintiffs’  problem  is  with  state  law  itself.  But  reading  the \n27  materiality statute broadly enough to cover the substance of state laws would not only \n28 \n  26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 40 of 46\n \n \n1  contravene its text and history but also give a “de facto green light to federal courts to \n2  rewrite dozens of state election laws around the country,” wherever any state imposes any \n3  requirements  on  voters  beyond  what  a  court  deems  to  be  the  state’s  material  voter \n4  qualifications. DNC v. Wis. State Legislature, 141 S. Ct. 28, 35 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., \n5  concurral). Indeed, under some Plaintiffs’ reading, even requiring voters to “check a box” \n6  to affirm that they fulfill the state’s voter qualifications goes too far, because “[w]hether a \n7  prospective voter ... fails to check a box” is not itself material to eligibility to vote. MFV-\n8  Cmpt. ¶102.  \n9  Poder Latinx’s claim under the related provision, 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A), fails \n10  for similar reasons (and lack of cause of action). Doc. 106, ¶¶99 et seq. That provision of \n11  the Civil Rights Act forbids the application of any “standard, practice, or procedure” in \n12  determining any individual’s qualification to vote that are “different from the standards, \n13  practices, or procedures applied under such law or laws to other individuals within the \n  \n14  same ... political subdivision.” Id. Like the materiality provision, this provision only covers \n15  ad hoc executive action and sets “State law” as the baseline for proper determination of \n16  voter qualifications. Plaintiffs cannot attack State law head-on with a federal statute \n17  demanding only the uniform implementation of State law.  \n18  2. Even if the materiality statute did dictate the substance of state law, it would still \n19  cover only state laws that “[d]eny the right of any individual to vote in any election.” 52 \n20  U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B). But the Acts do no such thing. Under the Acts, any “error or \n21  omission” is grounds not for automatic denial but for the initiation of a cure process. An \n22  application lacking satisfactory evidence of citizenship triggers, not an outright rejection, \n23  but a notice and opportunity to cure. HB 2492 § 4(C); A.R.S. § 16-134(B) (providing that \n24  “the county recorder shall notify the applicant within ten business days of receipt of the \n25  registration form” and “shall specify the missing or illegible information”). And under HB \n26  2243, evidence confirming that a registered voter is not a citizen triggers, not an automatic \n27 \n28 \n  27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 41 of 46\n \n \n1  cancellation, but a 35-Day Notice allowing the person to produce evidence of citizenship. \n2  HB 2243 § 2 (amending A.R.S. §161-165(a)(9)). \n3  3. Finally, even if the Acts did deny the right to vote due to an application’s errors \n4  or omissions, any error or omission would be “material in determining whether such \n5  individual is qualified under State law to vote in such election” and therefore not covered \n6  by § 10101(a)(2)(B). Arizona requires voters to be U.S. citizens and residents of the state. \n7  Ariz. Const. art. VII, §2, cl. A; A.R.S. § 16-101. The information required by the Acts—\n8  proof of citizenship, proof of residence, statement of birthplace, and checking a box to \n9  affirm U.S. citizenship—are all material to those requirements. Plaintiffs allege that the \n10  Acts’ requirements are not material because they are duplicative of each other, or because \n11  voter eligibility could be ascertained in other ways. USA-Cmpt. ¶¶67-68; MFV-Cmpt. \n12  ¶102; LUCHA FAC ¶¶345-49; DNC-Cmpt. ¶¶89-90. But “material” means “relevant,” not \n13  a bare, non-duplicative minimum. See Gonzalez v. Arizona, No. 06-CV-1268, 2007 WL \n  \n14  9724581, at *2 (D. Ariz. Aug. 28, 2007) (“Citizenship is material in determining whether \n15  an  individual  may  vote  and  Arizona’s  decision  to  require  more  proof  than  simply \n16  affirmation by the voter is not prohibited.”); Diaz v. Cobb, 435 F. Supp. 2d 1206, 1213 \n17  (S.D. Fla. 2006) (“Even if the check-boxes were duplicative of the oath, failing to check \n18  one or more boxes would not be an immaterial omission under the VRA.”).  \n19  All the information required by the Acts is at least material to voter eligibility. \n20  Checking the citizenship box is a minimally burdensome affirmation by the voter of \n21  fulfillment of the most basic eligibility requirement under state law. Proof of citizenship \n22  attests that a voter is indeed eligible. Proof of residence verifies the State’s only other \n23  requirement  of  eligibility.  And  birthplace—for  which  HB  2492  does  not  require \n24  documentary proof, see § 4(A); A.R.S. § 16-121.01(a)—is material to eligibility because \n25  it  helps  define  what  sort  of  proof  can  serve  to  demonstrate  citizenship.  All  of  this \n26  information helps election officials verify the eligibility of would-be voters, and the \n27 \n28 \n  28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 42 of 46\n \n \n1  materiality statute does not prevent the State from doing so in one way just because it \n2  might hypothetically be done in another way.  \n3  V.  LUCHA’s VRA § 2 CLAIM FAILS \n4  Finally, alone amongst Plaintiffs, LUCHA asserts a claim under the results-test of \n5  section 2 of the VRA. That claim is unripe, since it depends enormously on speculative \n6  racial disparities that “may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” Texas, \n7  523 U.S. at 300. See supra § I.B. But even if now ripe, the claim fails under Brnovich v. \n8  DNC, 141 S. Ct. 2321 (2021). \n9  Brnovich makes clear that “[m]ere inconvenience cannot be enough to demonstrate \n10  a violation of § 2” and further that claims under § 2 “must tolerate the ‘usual burdens of \n11  voting.’” Id. at 2338 (quoting Crawford, 553 U.S. at 198). As explained above (supra \n12  § II.A), the burdens involved here are simply not significant and gravely undermine \n13  LUCHA’s claim. Similarly, Brnovich requires consideration of “the strength of the state \n  \n14  interests,” which are compelling here as explained above and in Crawford and Gonzalez. \n15  Supra § II.A. \n16  In addition, the Supreme Court in Brnovich made plain that “[t]he size of any \n17  disparities in a rule’s impact on members of different racial or ethnic groups is also an \n18  important factor to consider.” Id. at 2339. But LUCHA’s Complaint makes little effort to \n19  quantify the size of an alleged disparities, saying only that “the impact on these populations \n20  is unique because the law will not equally affect Arizona residents writ large.” LUCHA \n21  FAC ¶369 (emphasis added).  \n22  But the VRA does not mandate that electoral laws affect all groups exactly equally. \n23  Indeed,  “differences  in  employment,  wealth,  and  education  may  make  it  virtually \n24  impossible for a State to devise rules that do not have some disparate impact.” Brnovich, \n25  141 S. Ct. at 2343. But that reality omnipresent for all or nearly all election regulations \n26  does not suffice (although it is largely what LUCHA offers, see, e.g., LUCHA FAC ¶¶174, \n27  186 (disparities in education), ¶¶172-73 (disparities in income)). \n28 \n  29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 43 of 46\n \n \n1  Ultimately, LUCHA’s bare allegation that the Acts “will not equally affect Arizona \n2  residents” (at ¶368) does not plausibly allege a violation of the VRA without substantially \n3  more detail establishing that the disparities are plausibly meaningful. LUCHA’s complaint \n4  fails to do so. \n5  Finally, Brnovich makes clear that for purposes of § 2, courts “must consider the \n6  opportunities provided by a State’s entire system of voting when assessing the burden \n7  imposed by a challenged provision.” 141. S. Ct. at 2339. That factor strongly favors the \n8  State as “Arizona law generally makes it very easy to vote.” Id. (emphasis added). \n9  Arizona makes voting substantially easier than its sister states through a variety of \n10  means,  including  (1)  online  registration,  (2)  not  requiring  any  excuse  to  obtain  an \n11  absentee/mail-in ballot, (3) making it easy to sign up for automatic mailing of ballots for \n12  all eligible elections, (4) pre-paying postage, (5) maintaining polling places despite high \n13  vote-by-mail usage, (6) placing voting drop boxes in areas with limited mail service, and \n  \n14  (7) requiring nothing more than a timely signature to vote by mail (unlike other states that \n15  require witnesses or notarization). Id. at 2344, 2346; Mi Familia Vota v. Hobbs, 977 F.3d \n16  948, 952 (9th Cir. 2020) (“Registration could be accomplished online or by mail.”); A.R.S. \n17  § 16-542 (postage pre-paid); Arizona Democratic Party v. Hobbs (“Hobbs II”), 976 F.3d \n18  1081, 1085-86 (9th Cir. 2020) (describing signature requirement).  \n19  All of those factors further militate against the plausibility of LUCHA’s VRA \n20  claim—particularly where the most that it will say about disparate impacts is that the Acts \n21  will not “will not equally affect” all groups. LUCHA FAC ¶368. That is undoubtedly true \n22  of virtually all election statutes ever drafted, and does not make out a plausible VRA \n23  section 2 claim. \n24  CONCLUSION \n25  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Complaints should be dismissed. \n26     \n27 \n28 \n  30 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 127   Filed 09/16/22   Page 44 of 46\n \n \n1  Respectfully submitted this 16th day of September, 2022. \n2   \n3  MARK BRNOVICH \nATTORNEY GENERAL \n4 \n \nBy: s/ Drew C.

AVIAC is led by \n4\nindividuals who have lost family members because of crimes committed by undocumented \n5\n6 immigrants.2  AVIAC’s mission includes being a source of support for such victims across \n7\nthe country and a resource for policies that will enforce the nation’s immigration laws and \n8\nprevent governmental incentives for illegal immigration. \n9\nAVIAC objects to providing non-citizens with the right to vote in any election, \n10\n11\nwhether local, state, or federal as it dilutes the votes of eligible U.S. citizens. Proof of \n12\ncitizenship is fundamental to ensuring that only U.S. citizens vote to protect America’s \n13\nrepresentative democracy. This case concerns the attempt by several Plaintiffs to override \n14\n15 the United States Constitution’s requirements that only U.S. citizens vote in elections, the \n16\nConstitution of the State of Arizona and House Bill 2492, which requires proof of U.S. \n17\ncitizenship to vote in elections. AVIAC supports the State of Arizona’s Consolidated \n18\n19 Motion to Dismiss based on Plaintiffs’ failure to state a viable claim, including but not \n20\nlimited to, violations of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.    \n21\nGiven its interest in strong borders and the protection of national sovereignty, \n22\nAVIAC has an interest in the continuation of the United States as a democracy in which \n23\n24\n \n25\n1 \nAll parties with the exception Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenors Mi Familia Vota, Poder Latinex, Chicanos Por La \n26 Causa and Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund have consented to the filing of this brief by Amicus. Pursuant to \nF.R.CIV.P. 7 and FED. R. APP. P. 29(a)(4)(E), undersigned counsel certifies that: counsel for the Amicus authored this \n27 brief in whole; no counsel for a party authored this brief in any respect; and no person or entity – other than Amicus, \nits members, and its counsel – contributed monetarily to this brief’s preparation or submission. \n28  \n2 https://www.aviac.us/ (viewed Aug. 21, 2022). \n1 \n \n\n \nthe people of the United States—that is, U.S. citizens—are the sovereign’s representatives. \n1\n2 AVIAC is concerned about incursions on the sovereignty of American citizens by non-\n3\ncitizens voting in local, state and federal elections. Accordingly, AVIAC seeks to ensure \n4\nthat only American citizens are permitted to vote in Arizona’s municipal, county, statewide \n5\n6 and federal elections. \n7\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n8\nEvery state has the right to prevent non-citizens from voting in local, state, and \n9\nnational elections.  In fact, the United States Constitution excludes non-citizens from the \n10\n11\nprivilege, and with good reason.  “Regulation of the electoral process receives unusual \n12\nscrutiny because ‘the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is \n13\npreservative of other basic civil and political rights.’”  Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 78-\n14\n15 79, 96 S. Ct. 1883, 1890-91 (1976), quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562; 84 S.Ct. \n16\n1362; 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964).  See also, Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336; 92 S. Ct. \n17\n995; 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1972).  In other words, the right to vote is accorded extraordinary \n18\n19 treatment because it is, in equal protection terms, an extraordinary right: a citizen cannot \n20\nhope to achieve any meaningful degree of individual political equality if granted an inferior \n21\nright of participation in the political process.”  Plyler v Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 233; 102 S. Ct. \n22\n2382; 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 810 (1982).  The Court has further stated that “[t]he fact that all \n23\n24\npersons, aliens and citizens alike, are protected by the Due Process Clause does not lead to \n25\nthe  further  conclusion  that  all  aliens  are  entitled  to  enjoy  all  the  advantages  of \n26\ncitizenship….  [A] host of constitutional and statutory provisions rest on the premise that \n27\n28 a legitimate distinction between citizens and aliens may justify attributes and benefits for \n2 \n \n\n \none class not accorded to the other, [e.g.,] [t]he Constitution protects the privileges and \n1\n2 immunities only of citizens, Amdt. 14, § 1; see Art. IV, § 2, cl. 1, and the right to vote only \n3\nof citizens. Amdts. 15, 19, 24, 26. Mathews, supra at 78-79, n. 12. \n4\nNot only does the Constitution protect citizens’ right to vote, but nothing in that \n5\n6 document could ever authorize the executive, legislative or judicial branch of the federal \n7\ngovernment to force the states  to allow non-citizens  to exercise  the same  privileges \n8\naccorded citizens of the United States and of the several states.  Moreover, the States have \n9\na compelling right (and interest) in preserving the integrity of their election processes by \n10\n11\nensuring that it protects against fraud and assures citizens of its integrity so that they will \n12\nexercise their right to vote with vigor and confidence. \n13\nARGUMENT \n14\n15 I.  ARIZONA’S PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT IS \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND DOES NOT VIOLATE THE NVRA \n16\n \n17 Arizona has had a citizenship requirement for voting since it became a State in 1912. \n18\nAriz. Const., Art. VII, § 2. While the Arizona Constitution itself does not prescribe the \n19\nqualifications of voters, it does provide that, “[n]o person shall be entitled to vote at any \n20\n21 general election,…, or upon any question which may be submitted to a vote of the people, \n22\nunless such person be a citizen of the United States…”  Id.  See also Ahrens v. Kerby, 44 \n23\nAriz. 269, 340, 37 P.2d 375, 377 (1934) (emphasis added). \n24\nThe Arizona Constitution further requires that “[t]here shall be enacted registration \n25\n26 and other laws to secure the purity of elections and guard against abuses of the elective \n27\nfranchise.” Ariz. Const, art. VII, § 12. This requirement places an affirmative duty upon \n28\n3 \n \n\n \nthe Arizona Legislature to ensure the integrity of elections. Ahrens at 44 Ariz. 269, 341, 37 \n1\n2 P.2d 375, 377 (“In fact, in section 12 of this article 7, it places upon the law-making branch \n3\nof the government the duty of enacting ‘registration and other laws to secure the purity of \n4\nelections and guard against abuses of the elective franchise.’).   \n5\n6 In fulfilling Arizona’s constitutional requirements, the Arizona legislature passed \n7\nan amendment that requires voter registrants to submit proof of citizenship - Arizona HB \n8\n2492. The Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Interveners object to this law for several reasons, among \n9\nthem,  the  United  States,  which  incorrectly  alleges  that  because  the  National  Voter \n10\n11\nRegistration Act requires merely an attestation but does not require proof of citizenship, \n12\nthe State of Arizona may not require the latter.  See U.S.A. v. State of Arizona, 2:22-cv-\n13\n01124-SRB. (The Federal Form specifies that an applicant must be a United States citizen \n14\n15 to vote in federal elections, requires the applicant to attest to the applicant’s citizenship… \n16\n52 U.S.C. § 20508(b)(2)). \n17\nThis is nonsense.  Under the existing Constitution of the United States, the federal \n18\n19 government, acting through the Executive, Legislative, or Judicial branch, cannot force a \n20\nstate to allow people who are not citizens of the United States to cast votes in federal \n21\nelections. States are not required to accept applicants for voter registration who cannot \n22\nprove United States Citizenship.  Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, \n23\n24\n15; 133 S. Ct. 2247; 186 L.Ed.2d 239 (2013).  And indeed, as to Time, Place, and Manner, \n25\nthe requirement that an eligible voter prove United States citizenship is constitutional and \n26\nunassailable by the federal government.  Id. \n27\n28\n4 \n \n\n \nThe Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, \n1\n2 but  not  who  may  vote  in  them.    Nothing  in  the  Constitution  provides  that  “voting \n3\nqualifications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.”  Id. at 16, citing Oregon v. \n4\nMitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 210; 91 S.Ct. 260; 27 L.Ed.2d 272 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring \n5\n6 in part and dissenting in part); see also U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 833-\n7\n834; 115 S. Ct. 1842; 131 L. Ed. 2d 881 (1995); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., \n8\n479 U. S. 208, 231-232; 107 S. Ct. 544; 93 L.Ed. 2d 514 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  \n9\nIf  an  applicant  is  unable  to  prove  citizenship,  the  state  can  reject  that  applicant’s \n10\n11\nregistration.  Id. \n12\nThe requirement of national citizenship to vote in national elections was never in \n13\ndoubt among the framers of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has consistently shored \n14\n15 up the notion that non-citizens are not, and should not be, entitled to vote in federal \n16\nelections.3  There is an unwritten, but just as fundamental, right and privilege of national \n17\ncitizenship to vote in national elections.  Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 665; 4 S. Ct. \n18\n19 152; 28 L. Ed. 274 (1884); Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U.S. 58; 21 S. Ct. 17; 45 L.Ed. 84, 88 \n20\n(1900).  In Yarbrough, in ruling that Congress had the power to enact the Fifteenth \n21\nAmendment to prohibit the states from denying the right to vote to citizens on the basis of \n22\nrace, the Court noted it was merely affirmation of a guarantee “as necessary to the right of \n23\n24\n \n25 3 Congress has also reaffirmed this principle in various statutory provisions. See e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 611 (it is a crime \npunishable by a fine and up to one year in prison for an alien to vote in a federal election); 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (any alien \n26 who has voted in violation of any Federal, State, or local constitutional provision, statute, ordinance, or regulation is \ndeportable); 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-10(2) (any false statement concerning an applicant’s citizenship status that is made \n27 on a registration form submitted to election authorities is a crime); 18 U.S.C. § 911 (knowing and willful false \nassertions of United States citizenship in order to vote are punishable by up to three years in prison) 18 U.S.C. § \n28 1015(f) (it is a criminal offense for an individual to make a false statement or claim that he or she is a citizen of the \nUnited States in order to register or to vote). \n5 \n \n\n \nother citizens to vote…and to the right to vote in general as to the right to be protected \n1\n2 against discrimination.”  Id. at 665.  In both instances, the Court concluded, the exercise of \n3\nthe right was protected by the Constitution.  Id. \n4\nWiley, supra, instructs that the states must ensure that the qualifications they impose \n5\n6 for  voting  in  national  elections  mirrors  the  requisite  qualifications  implicitly,  if  not \n7\nexplicitly, required by the National Constitution.  Wiley, 179 U.S. at 64.  Thus, the right to \n8\nvote in national elections is fundamentally based on the Constitution, and the Constitution \n9\nrequires that the states guarantee those privileges and defend those rights that obtain \n10\n11\nuniquely from national citizenship.  Id.  \n12\nMore specifically, the Court described the privilege as a fundamental constitutional \n13\nright preservative of all others.  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370, 6 S. Ct. 1064, \n14\n15 1071, 30 L.Ed. 220, 226 (1886).  As the Court later confirmed, an infringement upon this \n16\nright occurs where a legal citizen’s vote is diluted or nullified.  This nullification of an \n17\nindividual choice occurs whenever any illegitimate vote is cast, whether it be by a non-\n18\n19 citizen, a non-registered, or a non-existent “voter”. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 565; \n20\n84 S. Ct. 1362, 1383; 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (“each citizen [has] an equally effective voice \n21\nin the election … and the Constitution demands, no less.”).   \n22\nThus, a citizen’s right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has been \n23\n24\njudicially recognized as a right secured by the Constitution, when such impairment resulted \n25\nfrom dilution by a false tally, cf. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 314-15; 61 S. Ct. \n26\n1031; 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941); or by a refusal to count votes from arbitrarily selected \n27\n28 precincts, cf. United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 386-88; 35 S. Ct. 904; 59 L.Ed. 1355 \n6 \n \n\n \n(1915); or by a stuffing of the ballot box, cf. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 388; 25 L.Ed. \n1\n2 717 (1879); United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 389; 64 S. Ct. 1101; 88 L.Ed. 1341 \n3\n(1944).  See also, Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 208; 82 S. Ct. 691; 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962)  \n4\nAs the Court has stated when discussing the privileges of citizenship, a new citizen’s \n5\n6 right to vote and to participate in the democratic decision-making process “is the honorable \n7\nprerogative which no alien has a constitutional right to enjoy.”  Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. \n8\n291, 311; 98 S. Ct. 1067; 55 L.Ed.2d 287 (1978).  Therefore, “it is clear that a State may \n9\ndeny aliens the right to vote;” and “the right to participate in the making of policy….”  Id. \n10\n11\nat 291, 296-97.  These principles “lie at the heart of our political institutions.”  Id. at 291, \n12\nciting Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 647; 93 S. Ct. 2842; 37 L.Ed.2d 853 (1973).   \n13\nThus, the affirmative protections that the state may afford by way of statutes \n14\n15 requiring proof of citizenship to vote must be considered in light of the implied protections \n16\nafforded by the Constitution to all citizens by virtue of their status as such.  It is no more \n17\nan affront to the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens that their vote is cancelled or \n18\n19 nullified by the casting of a fraudulent vote, than by a vote that is cast by someone who \n20\ndoes not possess the privilege.  Baker, supra (recognizing that an important “badge of \n21\ncitizenship is the right to vote.”).  Obviously, if a non-citizen exercises this right, it removes \n22\nthis privilege from citizens and dilutes their choice.  Thus, States may define and regulate \n23\n24\nthe qualifications of its voters, and there is nothing in the Constitution that would prohibit \n25\nthe State from affirming by positive law that which is implicitly acknowledged in the \n26\nConstitution. \n27\n28\n7 \n \n\n \nFor an added measure of assurance, it is declared that “[t]he enumeration in the \n1\n2 Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained \n3\nby the people.”  U.S. Const. Amend. 9.  It was universally agreed by the Framers that there \n4\nare additional fundamental rights, protected from governmental infringement, which exist \n5\n6 alongside those specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments.  I Annals of Congress \n7\n439 (Gales and Seaton ed. 1834).  See also II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of \n8\nthe United States (5th ed. 1891), pp. 626-627.  “The [Ninth] Amendment…was proffered \n9\nto quiet expressed fears that a bill of specifically enumerated rights could not be sufficiently \n10\n11\nbroad to cover all essential rights and that the specific mention of certain rights would be \n12\ninterpreted as a denial that others were protected.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) \n13\n137, 174 (1803).  See also Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 229; 47 S. Ct. 21, 63 (1926). \n14\n15 As “it cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be \n16\nwithout effect…effect should be given to all the words it uses.”  United Pub. Workers v. \n17\nMitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 94-96; 67 S. Ct. 556 (1947).  And, indeed, a right to political \n18\n19 affiliation and political choice has been addressed as protected, at least in part, by this \n20\namendment.   This includes, of course, the fundamental right to vote.   Id.  See also \n21\nReynolds, 377 U.S. at 560. \n22\nThat the latter is the fundamental and primary right among all other fundamental \n23\n24\nrights, enumerated or not, is evident in the fact it is self-executing.  Infringement upon it \n25\ncannot occur under the Constitution if the government is, in fact, one that is duly and legally \n26\nchosen by the People.  Any government that asserts a federal mandate to rule on the basis \n27\n28\n8 \n \n\n \nof fraud or illegality effectuates an instant infringement on the sovereign’s will, and, of \n1\n2 necessity, has no legitimacy. \n3\nII.  STATES  HAVE  A  COMPELLING  INTEREST  IN  PROTECTING \n4 VOTER INTEGRITY AND PREVENTING DILUTION OF CITIZEN \nVOTES \n5\n \n6 “A State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its \n7\nelection process.”  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4; 127 S. Ct. 5; 166 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006), \n8\nciting Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 231; 109 \n9\nS.Ct. 1013; 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).  “Confidence in the integrity of our electoral processes \n10\n11\nis essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy.  Voter fraud drives honest \n12\ncitizens out of the democratic process and breeds distrust of our government.  Voters who \n13\nfear their legitimate votes will be outweighed by fraudulent ones will feel disenfranchised. \n14\n15 ‘[T]he right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a \n16\ncitizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.’ \n17\nReynolds, 377 U.S. at 555.  Countering the State’s compelling interest in preventing voter \n18\n19 fraud is the plaintiffs’ strong interest in exercising the ‘fundamental political right’ to vote. \n20\nDunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972) (internal \n21\nquotation marks omitted). Id. \n22\nIn Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 554-55, the Court held that “the right of suffrage can be \n23\n24\ndenied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as \n25\nby wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.” Purcell, supra.  Indeed, “the right \n26\nto have one’s vote counted is as open to protection . . . as the right to put a ballot in a box.” \n27\n28 Mosley, 238 U.S. at 386. See also Baker, 369 U.S. at 208 (explaining that voters have a \n9 \n \n\n \n“plain, direct and adequate interest in  maintaining  the  effectiveness of their  votes.”) \n1\n2 (internal quotation marks omitted); Reynolds, supra at 567 (explaining that vote dilution \n3\noccurs when “[a]n individual’s right to vote . . . is unconstitutionally impaired [because] \n4\nits weight is in a substantial fashion diluted [] compared with the votes of citizens in other \n5\n6 parts of the State.”). \n7\n“One strong and entirely legitimate state interest is the prevention of fraud. Fraud \n8\ncan affect the outcome of a close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of citizens \n9\nto cast ballots that carry appropriate weight. Fraud can also undermine public confidence \n10\n11\nin the fairness of elections and the perceived legitimacy of the announced outcome.” \n12\nBrnovich v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 210 L. Ed. 2d 753, 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2340 (2021); \n13\nGonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 403 (9th Cir. 2012), aff’d sub nom.  Arizona v. Inter \n14\n15 Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 133 S. Ct. 2247, 186 L. Ed. 2d 239 (2013) \n16\n(“ We recognize Arizona’s concern about fraudulent voter registration.”). \n17\nA democratic country permits only its citizens of that country with the right to vote.  \n18\n19 “Representative democracy in any populous unit of governance is unimaginable without \n20\nthe ability of citizens to band together in promoting among the electorate candidates who \n21\nespouse their political views.”  California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 574, \n22\n120 S. Ct. 2402, 2408, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2000) (emphasis added).  Allowing non-citizen \n23\n24\nparticipation in Arizona’s electoral process significantly undermines voters’ confidence in \n25\nthe  integrity  of  our  elections  and  discourages  voters  from  participating  because  of \n26\nlegitimate fears of vote dilution.  Both of these problems raise compelling state interests \n27\n28 that the State of Arizona has the absolute and unrestrained right to protect. \n10 \n \n\n \nIndeed, the problem of non-citizen participation in the democratic electoral and \n1\n2 legal processes reserved for citizens is not an abstract one: A 2005 Report from the \n3\nGovernment Accountability Office found that up to three (3%) percent of the 30,000 \n4\nindividuals chosen for jury duty from voter registration rolls in just one U.S. district court \n5\n6 over  a  two-year  period  were  not  U.S.  citizens.  Government  Accountability  Office, \n7\nElections:  Additional  Data  Could  Help  State  and  Local  Election  Officials  Maintain \n8\nAccurate  Voter  Registration  Lists  42  (2005),  available  at \n9\nwww.gao.gov/assets/250/246628.pdf. According to a separate study released in 2014 by \n10\n11\nseveral  professors  at  Old  Dominion  University  and  George  Mason  University, \n12\napproximately 6.4% of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2% of noncitizens voted in 2010. \n13\nJesse T. Richman, Gulshan A. Chattha, and David C. Earnest, Do noncitizens vote in U.S. \n14\n15 elections? Electoral Studies 36 (2014) 149-157. The Arizona Legislature therefore acted \n16\nwell within its constitutional role and consistent with its affirmative to duty to ‘secure the \n17\npurity of elections and guard against abuses of the elective franchise’ in enacting HB 2243 \n18\n19 and HB 2492 which will further strengthen the longstanding prohibition of non-citizen \n20\nparticipation in Arizona’s electoral process.  \n21\nCONCLUSION \n22\nArticle I, Section 4, of the U.S. Constitution is clear that election law is delegated \n23\n24\nto the States. Both the U.S. Constitution and the Constitution of Arizona clearly state that \n25\nonly U.S. citizens are permitted to vote in elections. Further, the State of Arizona’s \n26\nLegislature properly enacted HB 2243 and HB 2492 that requires proof of U.S. citizenship \n27\n28 in order to register to vote, regardless of whether a prospective voter used the federal form \n11 \n \n\n \nor Arizona’s voter registration form. By requiring proof of citizenship, HB 2243 and HB \n1\n2 2492 do not violate Section 6 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, section 7 \n3\n(“NVRA” or the “Act”), 52 U.S.C. § 20505.  As the late Justice Scalia noted in Inter Tribal \n4\nCouncil, supra at 17, that while the Elections Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 4, cl. 1, \n5\n6 empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, it does not regulate who \n7\nmay vote in them - the latter is left to the sole province of the States.  Justice Thomas, in \n8\nhis dissent, agreed, noting that, “The Framers did not intend to leave voter qualifications \n9\nto Congress […] Congressional legislation of voter qualifications was not part of the \n10\n11\nFramers' design.” Id. at 26. Justice Alito, in his dissent, concluded that, “Indeed, even if \n12\nneither the presumption against pre-emption nor the canon of constitutional avoidance \n13\napplied, the better reading of the Act would be that Arizona is free to require those who \n14\n15 use the federal form to supplement their applications with proof of citizenship.” Id. at 44. \n16\nThe NVRA is nothing more than an optional form narrowly tailored so that is does \n17\nnot violate the United States Constitution for each State’s legislature to determine their \n18\n19 own election laws. See U.S. Const. Art. I, §4. (“each State by the Legislature thereof…”) \n20\nTherefore, the States have full authority to enact election laws to protect voter integrity.  \n21\nNowhere does the NVRA expressly prohibit the States from requiring voter proof of \n22\ncitizenship, and in fact it could not do. See Inter Tribal Council, supra. \n23\n24  \n25\n  For the forgoing reasons, and those stated in Defendants’ Consolidated Motion to \n26\nDismiss, the Motion to Dismiss should be granted.  \n27\n28\n12 \n \n\n \n1   Respectfully submitted, this 23rd day of September, 2022. \n2  \n3  \n  /s/ Michael Ryan Williams \n4\nMICHAEL RYAN WILLIAMS, ESQ. \n5   3636 North Central Avenue \nPhoenix, Arizona 85012 \n6\n  State Bar No. 029703 \n7 m.ryan.williams@gmail.com  \n  (602) 740-0321 \n8\n \n9   CARSON J.

ECF Nos. 131 & 132. This \n19 \ntransparent end run around the Court’s page limits for briefing on the motion to dismiss \n20 \n21  should be denied. \n22 \nAn amicus brief serves three roles: “(1) to aid in a matter of general public interest; \n23 \n(2) to supplement efforts of counsel; and (3) to highlight relevant law that has escaped \n24 \nconsideration.” Miracle v. Hobbs, 333 F.R.D. 151, 156 (D. Ariz. 2019) (citing Miller-Wohl \n25 \n26  Co. v. Comm’r of Labor & Indus., State of Montana, 694 F.2d 203, 204 (9th Cir. 1982)). \n27 \n28 \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 134   Filed 09/26/22   Page 4 of 7\nIRLI and AVIAC’s proposed amicus briefs fail to fulfill the third role of an amicus brief, as \n1 \n2  both briefs offer largely redundant legal argument and provide no new law to the Court. \n3 \nSpecifically, much of what IRLI and AVIAC’s proposed amici briefs contain is \n4 \nduplicative of the arguments in the pending motion to dismiss. The vast majority of AVIAC's \n5 \nproposed amicus brief is devoted to additional legal argument concerning the NVRA, with \n6 \n7  the rest reiterating the state’s compelling interest in voter integrity. See ECF No. 132-1 at 3-\n8 \n11. IRLI splits its proposed amicus brief equally between even more briefing concerning the \n9 \nNVRA and its argument for why Plaintiffs cannot state a claim under the Anderson-Burdick \n10 \ntest. See ECF No. 131-1 at 4-16. All of these issues are briefed in the consolidated Motion \n11 \n12  to Dismiss, so in essence, IRLI and AVIAC merely wish to elaborate on the arguments the \n13 \nState of Arizona and Attorney General Brnovich have already made as to consolidated \n14 \nPlaintiffs’ claims—to add their voice to the chorus. Additional pages for the parties to brief \n15 \nthe numerous alleged legal violations in these five cases would benefit the Court and \n16 \n17  facilitate  an  efficient  resolution  of  these  disputed  federal  constitutional  and  statutory \n18 \nquestions. However, the Court has already set strict page limits for the parties who have a \n19 \nfar greater stake in the outcome of this case than IRLI and AVIAC. IRLI and AVIAC’s \n20 \nbriefs are merely an end run around those page limits. \n21 \n22  Amicus briefs such as these—which merely expand on arguments already presented \n23 \nto the Court by the parties—are disfavored and accordingly have been repeatedly rejected, \n24 \nincluding in this district. See, e.g., JZ v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., No. CV-20-00490-\n25 \nTUC-RCC, 2021 WL 5396089, at *1 (D. Ariz. Nov. 18, 2021) (rejecting motion for leave \n26 \nto file amicus brief that “serve[d] mainly to duplicate Plaintiffs’ assertions and [did] not raise \n27 \n28 \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 134   Filed 09/26/22   Page 5 of 7\nlegal arguments of which the Court [was] not already aware based on the parties’ briefs and \n1 \n2  applicable law”); Long v. Coast Resorts, Inc., 49 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1178 (D. Nev. 1999) \n3 \n(“The vast majority of amicus curiae briefs are filed by allies of litigants and duplicate the \n4 \narguments made in the litigants’ briefs, in effect merely extending the length of the litigant’s \n5 \nbrief. Such amicus briefs should not be allowed.” (quoting Ryan v. Commodity Futures \n6 \n7  Trading Comm’n, 125 F.3d 1062, 1063 (7th Cir. 1997)). \n8 \nFurther, these proposed amici briefs would add significantly to the pages afforded to \n9 \nDefendants’ position and permitting them would invite more briefing from amici supportive \n10 \nof Plaintiffs. IRLI’s proposed amicus brief is 17 pages long, and AVIAC’s proposed amicus \n11 \n12  brief is 11 pages long. That is a combined additional 28 pages in support of the motion to \n13 \ndismiss for a total of 58 pages in combination with the State of Arizona and Attorney \n14 \nGeneral’s brief of 30 pages. And this total of course does not include the reply brief. The \n15 \nPoder Latinx Plaintiffs respectfully submit that proposed amici should not be granted more \n16 \n17  pages than Plaintiffs are afforded in opposing the motion to dismiss, if writing separately. \n18 \nIn addition, as this litigation has gained considerable attention among national and Arizona \n19 \norganizations and coalitions dedicated to voting rights and civic engagement, if the Court \n20 \ngrants IRLI’s and AVIAC’s motions and considers their amicus briefs, it will of course be \n21 \n22  inviting amicus curiae briefs in support of consolidated Plaintiffs’ opposition(s) to the \n23 \npending motion to dismiss. No amicus briefs should be allowed in these district court \n24 \nproceedings; but if any are allowed, then all amici should be. \n25 \nIn sum, Defendants should not be afforded additional pages for their motion to \n26 \ndismiss through an amicus curiae loophole, but if they are, amici on all sides should be \n27 \n28 \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 134   Filed 09/26/22   Page 6 of 7\npermitted to enter and Plaintiffs should be granted the opportunity to respond to these amicus \n1 \n2  briefs. Rather than invite further briefing from all sides, this Court should deny IRLI and \n3 \nAVIAC’s motions. \n4 \nDated: September 26, 2022                                  Respectfully submitted, \n5 \n/s/ Jon Sherman \n6 \n       Jon Sherman* \n7         D.C.

Indeed, the right to vote is the signature benefit of citizenship. \n4  Plaintiffs’  arguments,  however,  ultimately  boil  down  to  the  proposition  that \n5  requiring any actual proof of citizenship beyond a person’s mere say-so violates multiple \n6  provisions of the U.S. Constitution and federal statutory law. But the only violation here \n7  is that premise’s incompatibility with common sense and the governing law. The modest \n8  requirements  imposed  by  HB  2492  and  2243  are  common-sense  integrity  measures \n9  strikingly similar to those upheld by the Supreme Court in Crawford v. Marion Cnty. \n10  Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008) and the Ninth Circuit in Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d \n11  383, 409 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc). They should be upheld here for similar reasons. \n12  I. Private Plaintiffs’ claims fail for lack of Article III standing. Despite the panoply \n13  of  litigants, none have  successfully  established  representational  or  organizational \n   14  standing.  None  alleged  harm  to  identifiable  members  as  Supreme  Court  precedent \n15  demands. Further, no Private Plaintiff establishes a non-speculative diversion of resources \n16  from the operation of the challenged Acts, as opposed to their efforts to challenge them. \n17  Many of Private Plaintiffs’ claims are also unripe, as the alleged harms are contingent on \n18  the speculative future events lacking any real-world implementation data. \n19  II.  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  claims  fail  under  binding  precedent.  Plaintiffs’ \n20  Anderson-Burdick claims fail because the burden imposed by the Acts is minimal and \n21  justified by the States’ interest secure elections, as confirmed by the decisions in Crawford \n22  and Gonzalez. Plaintiffs’ due process claims fail for similar reasons as they too are \n23  analyzed under the Anderson-Burdick framework. Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims fail \n24  for the same reason, and further because Plaintiffs’ claims do not involve a suspect class \n25  and do not establish that the relevant voters are similarly situated.  \n26  III. Plaintiffs’ NVRA claims fail because Congress lacks the authority under the \n27  Elections Clause to regulate Presidential and state elections, and the Acts do not affect \n28  Congressional  elections.  Nor  was  the  NVRA  enacted  under  the  Reconstruction \n  1 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 13 of 43\n \n1  Amendments’ remedial provisions, and even if it were, it would not be a constitutional \n2  exercise of them.  \n3  IV. Private Plaintiffs’ Section 10101 claims fail because that provision lacks a \n4  private cause of action. And all Plaintiffs’ §10101’s claims fail to allege a violation of \n5  either the materiality or nondiscrimination provisions. The materiality provision is not \n6  violated because the challenged requirements are material to State law qualifications. And \n7  the nondiscrimination provision is not violated because the Acts apply uniformly to voters. \n8  ARGUMENT \n9  I.  SOME OF PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE NON-JUSTICIABLE \n10  A.  Private Plaintiffs Lack Article III Standing \n11  1.  No Plaintiff Has Established Representational Standing. \n12  Plaintiffs DNC, Poder Latinx, and LUCHA argue that they have representational \n13  standing. However, each failed to “make specific allegations establishing that at least one \n   14  identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 \n15  U.S. 488, 498 (2009) (emphasis added).  \n16  DNC and LUCHA assert that members of their organization will suffer injury in \n17  future elections, including DNC’s “competitive” injury, based on allegations that members \n18  will be removed from the voter rolls or unable to register. (Doc. 151 at 10; Doc. 153 at 8–\n19  9.) Yet there are no allegations that any of these members intend to vote in the next \n20  election, will seek to register to vote prior to the next election, or that any of their members \n21  are registered to vote without POC or lack the documents necessary to establish POC. \n22  Instead,  DNC  and  LUCHA  rely  on  the  statistical probability  that  some  unidentified \n23  member will be affected in some unidentified way, the exact argument that the Court \n24  rejected in Summers. 555 U.S. at 498. “This requirement of naming the affected members \n25  has never been dispensed with in light of statistical probabilities, but only where all the \n26  members of the organization are affected by the challenged activity.” Id. at 498–99. \n27  Thus, National Council of La Raza v. Cegavske is inapposite. 800 F.3d 1032 (9th \n28  Cir. 2015). There, the court concluded that it was not speculative that a member of the \n  2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 14 of 43\n \n1  plaintiff organization suffered injury. Id. at 1041. Specifically, the organization alleged \n2  that individual members had been harmed by the state’s “failure to comply with [the \n3  NVRA] because their members have not been and will not be offered the opportunity to \n4  register to vote through DHHS Offices” based on data and field investigations. Id. at 1036–\n5  37 (cleaned up). Thus, the allegations established that individual members already suffered \n6  “injury as a result of Nevada’s failure to comply with Section 7.” Id. at 1041. Here, the \n7  laws are not in effect, so there is no past injury to any individual member to rely on to \n8  support standing, rendering Cegavske inapposite. \n9  Poder Latinx has no members, but it asserts (at 8) it has standing because it \n10  represents a “specialized segment” of the population, citing Oregon Advocacy Center v. \n11  Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1112 (9th Cir. 2003). However, Poder Latinx distorts the court’s \n12  reasoning there. In Oregon Advocacy, the court held that the organization had standing \n13  because it was the functional equivalent of a voluntary membership organization given \n   14  that its leadership was made up mostly of a “specialized segment” of the population it \n15  represented and, significantly, that it “may be adversely affected by the outcome of this \n16  litigation.” Id. In contrast, Poder Latinx has not cited any allegations that its leadership is \n17  mostly made up of the “specialized segment” it purportedly represents or that it will be \n18  adversely affected by the outcome of this litigation. (Doc. 154 at 8.) That certain members \n19  of this specialized segment might be adversely affected by the litigation’s outcome does \n20  not speak to whether Poder Latinx will, and certainly supplies Poder Latinx license to \n21  speak for all Latino voers. \n22  Moreover, DNC, Poder Latinx, and LUCHA have not identified any members who \n23  intend to vote in the next election. They merely assume one of their members will do so. \n24  “[T]his kind of general intent to decide, ‘at some point,’ to cast a ballot in a particular way \n25  that may disenfranchise them ‘epitomizes speculative injury.’” Yazzie v. Hobbs, 977 F.3d \n26  964, 966–67 (9th Cir. 2020); accord Townley v. Miller, 722 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir. \n27  2013). “[I]t is not enough ... to simply ‘speculate’ that the [voting law] ‘would be ... a \n28  difficult burden on’” their members, as DNC, Poder Latinx, and LUCHA do here. See \n  3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 15 of 43\n \n1  Yazzie, 977 F.3d at 966–67 (second ellipsis in original) (citation omitted).  \n2  Any injury to any individual members of DNC, Poder Latinx, or LUCHA is too \n3  speculative to support their claims. Thus, they cannot establish representational standing. \n4  2.  Private Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged Organizational \nStanding Either  \n5 \n6  Organizations have standing to challenge governmental action when they “show \n7  that the challenged conduct frustrated their organizational missions and that they diverted \n8  resources to combat that conduct.” Friends of the Earth v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., 992 \n9  F.3d 939, 942 (9th Cir. 2021). “[M]erely continuing ongoing activities does not” show a \n10  diversion  of  resources.  Id.  Thus,  in  Friends  of  the  Earth,  the  court  concluded  that \n11  “continuation  of  existing  advocacy”  in  response  to  certain  action  did  not  support \n12  organizational standing. See id. at 943–45. \n13  Here too, Private Plaintiffs have not established that there is a diversion of resources \n   14  from HB 2243 or 2492 because they assert that they will continue to engage in the same \n15  ongoing voter registration efforts—irrespective of HB 2243 or 2492. (Doc. 150 at 4; Doc. \n16  151 at 10–11; Doc. 153 at 9; Doc. 154 at 7; No. 22-CV-1381, Doc. 89 at 10–11.) All of \n17  the activities Private Plaintiffs cite in their briefing as diversions from HB 2243 and \n18  2492—including efforts to keep registered voters on the rolls—are just various forms of \n19  continued voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts. Private Plaintiffs simply plan to \n20  “continue[] doing what they were already doing” and going about “business as usual,” just \n21  like the plaintiffs in Friends of the Earth. See 992 F.3d at 943. That did not suffice in \n22  Friends of the Earth, and should not suffice here either. Private Plaintiffs’ failure to any \n23  necessary diversion of resources to other activities is thus fatal here. \n24  Indeed, an organization cannot gain standing “merely by virtue of its efforts and \n25  expense to advise others how to comport with the law, or by virtue of its efforts and \n26  expense to change the law.” Fair Elections Ohio v. Husted, 770 F.3d 456, 460 (6th Cir. \n27  2014). This type of injury to an “abstract social interest in maximizing voter turnout” does \n28  not confer standing. Id. at 461. Because Private Plaintiffs likewise assert injury to this same \n  4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 16 of 43\n \n1  interest—i.e., expenses incurred in advising Arizonians how to comply with the law to get \n2  registered to vote, they too lack standing. \n3  Nothing about HB 2243 or 2492 requires Private Plaintiffs to expend additional \n4  funds to further their mission. To start, the provisions are not even in effect yet, so it is \n5  entirely speculative whether registration efforts will be more difficult. Private Plaintiffs \n6  cannot “manufacture injury by ... simply choosing to spend money fixing a problem that \n7  otherwise would not affect the organization at all.” La Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake \n8  Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010). There is no indication \n9  that the Acts will necessarily cause Private Plaintiffs to incur any additional expense in its \n10  voter registration efforts. Indeed, “the mere fact that [an organization] has spent, and \n11  continues to spend, resources registering voters” does not show that it has suffered injury \n12  as a direct result of government action. See Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now v. \n13  Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 362 (5th Cir. 1999). HB 2243 and 2492 also applies to everyone \n   14  registering or registered to vote in Arizona such that “the alleged injury to the organization \n15  likely will be one that is shared by a large class of citizens and thus insufficient to establish \n16  injury in fact.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. United States (“NTEU”), 101 F.3d 1423, \n17  1430 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Private Plaintiffs have not sufficiently asserted that spending \n18  money on voter registration efforts is traceable to HB 2243 and 2492. Plaintiffs thus have \n19  not shown organizational standing.  \n20  Further, whether the Acts are causing injury to Private Plaintiffs is too speculative. \n21  “If a defendant’s conduct does not conflict directly with an organization’s stated goals, it \n22  is entirely speculative whether the defendant’s conduct is impeding the organization’s \n23  activities.” NTEU, 101 F.3d at 1430. “Absent a direct conflict” between the challenged \n24  action  and  the  organization’s  mission,  it  is  speculative  whether  the  organization’s \n25  “additional expenditure of funds is truly necessary to” further the mission or “rather is \n26  unnecessary alarmism constituting a self-inflicted injury.” Id. That is just so here. \n27 \n28 \n  5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 17 of 43\n \n1  3.  San Carlos Apache Tribe Has Not Shown Parens Patriae \nStanding \n2 \n3  To establish parens patriae standing, “more must be alleged than injury to an \n4  identifiable  group  of  individual  residents,  the  indirect  effects  of  the  injury  must  be \n5  considered as well in determining whether the State has alleged injury to a sufficiently \n6  substantial segment of its population.” Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., \n7  Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982). Here, San Carlos Apache Tribe alleges injury to a defined \n8  segment of its residents: those without ready access to POR. (Doc. 153 at 9–10.) But a \n9  tribe asserting parens patriae standing much show “it is acting on behalf of all of its \n10  members,” not just individual members. Navajo Nation v. Superior Ct., 47 F. Supp. 2d \n11  1233, 1240 (E.D. Wash. 1999), aff’d 331 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir. 2003). Moreover, the Tribe \n12  has not described how many of its 11,000 residents are even affected. San Carlos Apache \n13  Tribe has not met its burden of establishing parens patriae standing. \n   14    Privates Plaintiffs lack standing.1 Dismissal is therefore necessary here. \n15  B.  Several Of Private Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Ripe \n16  Private  Plaintiffs’  challenges  to  the  Citizenship  Question  and  Birthplace \n17  Requirements,  claims  based  on  the  Database  and  Investigation  Requirements,  and \n18  LUCHA’s VRA § 2 claim are also not ripe. A claim is not ripe when it “is riddled with \n19  contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review.” Trump v. New York, 141 S. \n20  Ct. 530, 535 (2020). Consequently, in Trump v. New York, a case was not ripe because \n21  “[t]he Government’s eventual action will reflect both legal and practical constraints, \n22  making any prediction about future injury just that—a prediction.” Id. at 536. \n23  Here too, Private Plaintiffs’ claims that HB 2243 and 2492 will prevent individuals \n24  from voting relies wholly on contingencies and speculation based on future uncertain \n25   \n1  AAANHPI asserts (at 9) the State lacks “standing” to seek dismissal for non-moving \n26 \ndefendants, citing Mantin v. Broadcast Music, Inc., 248 F.2d 530, 531 (9th Cir. 1957). But \nMantin is inapposite because it dealt with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, \n27 \nnot (unwaivable) lack of jurisdiction. In any event, federal courts have “an independent \nduty to assure that standing exists, irrespective of whether the parties challenge it.” Wash. \n28 \nEnv’t Council v. Bellon, 732 F.3d 1131, 1139 (9th Cir. 2013). AAANHPI’s suggestion that \nthis Court could simply ignore its lack of jurisdiction as to other parties is unserious. \n  6 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 18 of 43\n \n1  action by individuals registering to vote and decisions by governmental actors that will \n2  affect future elections. Reclaim Idaho v. Little, 826 F. App’x 592, 600 n.5 (9th Cir. 2020) \n3  (“To the extent Reclaim seeks relief from impending threats they may face in future \n4  elections, that claim is not ripe.”). Allowing the “process [to] run its course not only brings \n5  ‘more manageable proportions’ to the scope of the parties’ dispute ... but also ‘ensures that \n6  we  act  as  judges,  and  do  not  engage  in  policymaking  properly  left  to  elected \n7  representatives.” Trump, 141 S. Ct. at 536; accord Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 323 \n8  (1991) (“Determination of the scope and constitutionality of legislation in advance of its \n9  immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract \n10  an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.”). Ultimately, no injury may \n11  arise.  Private  Plaintiffs’  challenges  to  the  Citizenship  Question  and  Birthplace \n12  Requirements,  claims  based  on  the  Database  and  Investigation  Requirements,  and \n13  LUCHA’s VRA § 2 claim are too speculative, and thus, are not ripe. \n   14  II.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT PLED VIABLE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS  \n15  Plaintiffs  assert  various  constitutional  claims  under  the  Anderson-Burdick \n16  framework, procedural due process, and the Equal Protection Clause. However, binding \n17  precedent forecloses these claims, and thus, dismissal is necessary. \n18    A.  Plaintiffs’ Facial Challenges Fail as a Matter of Law. \n19    “The Supreme Court repeatedly has assessed challenges to election laws, including \n20  election-related deadlines, under the framework now described as the Anderson/Burdick \n21  framework.” Ariz. Democratic Party v. Hobbs (“Hobbs II”), 18 F.4th 1179, 1195 (9th Cir. \n22  2021). “Under [that framework], a court ‘must identify and evaluate the interests put \n23  forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make the \n24  “hard judgment” that our adversary system demands.’” Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, \n25  409 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc) (quoting Crawford, 553 U.S. at 190 (plurality)). \n26    Gonzalez is exactly on point and forecloses Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. There, \n27  the Ninth Circuit upheld a requirement that voters show identification for in-person voting. \n28  Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 404, 409-10. The court explained that “the burden imposed on \n  7 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 19 of 43\n \n1  citizens who must obtain a photo identification document was not sufficiently heavy to \n2  support a facial attack on the constitutionality of the state law, in light of the state’s \n3  legitimate  interests  in  deterring  and  detecting  voter  fraud,  modernizing  election \n4  procedures,  and  safeguarding  voter  confidence.”  Id.  The  burden  of  obtaining \n5  identification, which included showing documents that may require a small fee to obtain, \n6  such as a birth certificate, certificate of naturalization, or passport, was minimal. See id. \n7  The state’s weighty interests easily surpassed the Anderson-Burdick balancing test against \n8  a facial challenge. See id. \n9    Although  Plaintiffs  attempt  to  distinguish  Gonzalez  based  on  the  procedural \n10  posture, nothing in the court’s analysis of the constitutional issues raised relied on the \n11  development of any facts. The court looked exclusively to how the statute operated and \n12  accepted that some voters would have to pay a fee to get the identification needed to vote.  \n13    Plaintiffs raise the exact same issues as burdens on voting rights here. Specifically, \n   14  several Plaintiffs allege the POR and POC requirements are burdens because some will \n15  have to pay fees to meet them. The Ninth Circuit rejected that exact argument, stating that \n16  “any payment associated with obtaining the documents ... is related to the state’s legitimate \n17  interest in assessing the eligibility and qualifications of voters” which outweighed the \n18  resulting minimal burdens. Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 410. No factual development will make \n19  this minimal burden overcome the State’s legitimate interests in detecting voter fraud, \n20  modernizing election procedures, and safeguarding voter confidence on Plaintiffs’ facial \n21  challenge devoid of any factual or individualized context.2  \n22   \n2  LUCHA and MFV cite Mecinas and Soltysik, (Doc. 153 at 11; Doc. 150 at 6), but those \n23  cases do not apply here. In Mecinas, the Ninth Circuit concluded that there were factual \nissues regarding whether the State could meet its interest of ballot management by a \n24  procedure other than one that allegedly led to Republicans being listed on the top position \nfor each race, thereby precluding dismissal. Mecinas v. Hobbs, 30 F.4th 890, 903–04 (9th \n25 \nCir. 2022). In Soltysik, the burden was not minimal and the statute explicitly targeted \ncandidates who lacked party affiliation. Soltysik v. Padilla, 910 F.3d 438, 446 (9th Cir. \n26 \n2018). Against that burden, the government’s interest in avoiding voter confusion was not \nenough to prevail at the pleading stage. See id. Mecinas and Soltysik are both unhelpful \n27 \nhere because Crawford and Gonzalez—binding case law—explicitly hold that a party \n28  cannot prevail on a facial challenge to an identification requirement that may include fees, \nsuch as the ones at issue here, because the State’s weighty interests in voter integrity and \nmodernization is sufficient to support the statutes. Indeed, Mecinas and Soltysik involved \n  8 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 20 of 43\n \n1    Indeed, in Crawford, the lead opinion described that “[w]hen we consider only the \n2  statute’s broad application to all Indiana voters we conclude that it ‘imposes only a limited \n3  burden on voters’ rights.’” 553 U.S. at 202–03 (emphasis added). The lead opinion refused \n4  “to perform a unique balancing analysis that look[ed] specifically at a small number of \n5  voters who may experience a special burden under the statute and weighs their burdens \n6  against the State’s broad interests in protecting election integrity” despite evidence that \n7  some voters would face financial and other difficulties in obtaining the documentation \n8  necessary to obtain the identification required to vote. See id. at 200–01. It further rejected \n9  that invalidation of the statute was appropriate “even assuming an unjustified burden on \n10  some voters.” Id. at 203 (emphasis added). “The application of the statute to the vast \n11  majority of Indiana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting ‘the integrity \n12  and reliability of the electoral process.’” Id. at 204. “The state interests identified as \n13  justifications for SEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to require ... reject[ing] \n   14  petitioners’ facial attack on the statute.” Id. \n15  Plaintiffs explicitly rely on the burden on some voters, (see, e.g., Doc. 153 at 4–5, \n16  11–12), but HB 2492 and 2243 are facially neutral laws that apply to all voters and that \n17  the Legislature enacted to advance the integrity and reliability of the electrical process.3 \n18  Thus, as in Crawford, where a challenge to a neutral and generally applicable law failed \n19  because it was based exclusively on burdens that apply only to some voters, here too, \n20  Plaintiffs’ claims fail as well for the same reason. 553 U.S. at 202–03. \n21  Plaintiffs’ contention that the State has not adequately established fraud is likewise \n22 \n \nas-applied  challenges  with  particularly  injured  candidates,  not  facial  challenges  like \n23 \nPlaintiffs’ that are based on vague, contextless effects on some Arizona voters. \n   AAANHPI  is  also  wrong  that  Soltysik  establishes  the  need  for  further  factual \n24 \ndevelopment here. Unlike the State’s interests, which can be resolved as a matter of \n25  precedent and law, the “voter confusion” at issue in Soltysik was a heavily factbound issue \nof first impression requiring further development. 910 F.3d at 448. \n26  3  LUCHA Plaintiffs’ insistence that some persons cannot show POR also would make \nresidency requirements unenforceable. (See Doc. 153 at 12–13.) Decades of precedent \n27 \nsupport the State’s authority to ensure voters are residents of the State. See, e.g., Marston \nv. Lewis, 410 U.S. 679, 679 (1973) (upholding Arizona’s 50-day residency requirement \n28 \nfor voting). Again, the impact on some voters is not sufficient to support a facial challenge. \nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 202–03. \n  9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 21 of 43\n \n1  meritless because the State need not need present evidence of fraud before implementing \n2  voter regulations. “[B]ecause a government has such a compelling interest in securing the \n3  right to vote freely and effectively, th[e] Court never has held a State ‘to the burden of \n4  demonstrating empirically the objective effects on political stability that [are] produced’ \n5  by the voting regulation in question.” Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 208–09 (1992) \n6  (citation omitted). “Elections vary from year to year, and place to place,” rendering it \n7  “difficult to make specific findings about the effects of a voting regulation.” Id. Further, \n8  in Crawford, although there was “no evidence of any such fraud actually occurring in \n9  Indiana at any time in its history,” the Court concluded that voter fraud was a legitimate \n10  interest, in part, because of “flagrant examples of such fraud in other parts of the country \n11  [that] have been documented throughout this Nation’s history” and “occasional examples \n12  [that] have surfaced in recent years.” 553 U.S. at 194–95.  \n13  AAANHPI cites no case where a court has factored in the possibility of criminal \n   14  investigation for voter registration fraud as a “burden.” Because it is not. Indeed, “[t]he \n15  desire not to be investigated for voter registration fraud is not a fundamental right.” \n16  Moseley v. Price, 300 F. Supp. 2d 389, 397 (E.D. Va. 2004). In any event, the relevant \n17  burdens are “on the voting process,” Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 409, and a possible voter fraud \n18  investigation is not part of the voting process. \n19  Finally, Plaintiffs attempt to transmute HB 2492 and 2243 from a neutral and \n20  generally applicable law into a discriminatory law by crafting various classes that are \n21  created  by  these  provisions.  Comparing  Federal  Form  users  to  State  Form  users  or \n22  naturalized citizens to birthright citizens is disingenuous because HB 2492 and 2243 apply \n23  the same rules to everyone. In Crawford, the Supreme Court refused to do exactly what \n24  Plaintiffs ask this Court to do: “perform a unique balancing analysis that looks specifically \n25  at a small number of voters who may experience a special burden under the statute and \n26  weighs their burdens against the State’s broad interests in protecting election integrity.” \n27  553 U.S. at 200–01. Plaintiffs cannot slice and dice Arizona voters into classes to create \n28 \n  10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 22 of 43\n \n1  special burdens to incorporate into the Anderson-Burdick balancing.4 \n2  Ultimately,  HB  2492  and  2243  advance  the  State’s  legitimate  interest  in  the \n3  integrity and reliability of the electrical process, and these provisions are a minimal burden, \n4  at most, on the voter rights of some voters. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ facial challenges fail \n5  as a matter of law under Crawford and Gonzalez. \n6  B.  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Stated  a  Procedural  Due  Process  Claim. \n7    The Ninth Circuit has explicitly stated, after citing authority from the Fifth and \n8  Eleventh Circuits, that “the Anderson/Burdick approach is better suited to the context of \n9  election laws than is the more general Eldridge test,” which applies to procedural due \n10  process claims. Hobbs II, 18 F.4th at 1195. Both the Fifth and Eleventh Circuit decisions \n11  cited by the Ninth Circuit rejected that there is a freestanding procedural due process claim \n12  and instead applied the Anderson/Burdick test. Richardson v. Tex. Sec’y of State, 978 F.3d \n13  220, 233–35 (5th Cir. 2020); New Ga. Project v. Raffensperger, 976 F.3d 1278, 1282 (11th \n   14  Cir. 2020). And the Supreme Court itself has commanded that “[a] court considering a \n15  challenge to a state election law must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted \n16  injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff \n17  seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for \n18  the burden imposed”—i.e., the Anderson/Burdick framework. Burdick v. Takushi, 504 \n19  U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (cleaned up) (emphasis added).  \n20  However, even if Plaintiffs could assert a procedural due process claim that does \n21  not fall into the Anderson-Burdick framework, none of them has properly pleaded such a \n22  claim. To start, the Ninth Circuit has held that a procedural due process claim fails if the \n23  government’s interest outweighs the burden under the Anderson-Burdick framework. See \n24  Lemons v. Bradbury, 538 F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008). Moreover, HB 2243 provides \n25  sufficient notice and an opportunity to be heard to satisfy due process. Under HB 2243, \n26  the  county  recorder  must  provide  notice  before  cancelation  of  registration  based  on \n \n27 \n4  MFV/VL wrongly asserts that the burden on voting rights is severe because those who \ndo not comply with the statute cannot vote. (Doc. 150 at 6–7.) But the relevant burden is \n28 \nthat of complying with the requirement, not the “consequence of noncompliance.’” Hobbs \nII, 18 F.4th at 1188-89 (citation omitted). \n  11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 23 of 43\n \n1  “confirm[ation] that the person registered is not a United States citizen” and an opportunity \n2  to cure by providing POC, including a license number or naturalization number. HB 2243 \n3  § 2(A)(10). And after cancelation, the county recorder must send a “notice by forwardable \n4  mail informing the person that the person’s registration has been cancelled, the reason for \n5  the cancelation, the qualifications of electors pursuant to section 16-101 and instructions \n6  on registering to vote if the person is qualified.” HB 2243 § 2(K). When one’s registration \n7  is cancelled, the individual can nevertheless register to vote prior to the election. Thus, \n8  there is no deprivation of any liberty interest in the right to vote, and presence on the voter \n9  rolls is not a liberty interest that due process protects. See Teel v. Darnell, No. 1:07-CV-\n10  271, 2008 WL 474185, at *8 (E.D. Tenn. Feb. 20, 2008). \n11  HB 2492 also does not deprive anyone of a protected interest. Ingraham v. Wright, \n12  430 U.S. 651, 672 (1977) (due process is only required when a “protected interest[] is \n13  implicated”). Individuals must complete voter registration before they can exercise the \n   14  right to vote—including voting by mail—and thus, HB 2492 does not deprive them of \n15  protected interest in voting by adding certain eligibility requirements for registration.5 \n16  Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 409 (describing “the state’s power to fix core voter qualifications”); \n17  Lawson v. Shelby County, 211 F.3d 331, 336 (6th Cir. 2000) (“The U.S. Constitution \n18  protects an individual’s right to vote during an election, not the right to register to vote \n19  prior to an election.”); Teel, 2008 WL 474185, at *8 (explaining party could have avoided \n20  any deprivation by showing that he met eligibility requirements to vote); Wash. State \n21  Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449-50, 454-57 (2008) (refusing \n22  to strike down election law on facial challenge based on mere speculation and explaining \n23  facial challenges are disfavored because they risk “premature interpretation of statutes on \n24 \n \n25  5  To the extent Plaintiffs assert a due process claim based on changing the voter eligibility \nrequirements, including by mail, that claim fails too. Because HB 2492 is a legislative \n26 \naction, voters’ due process “rights are protected in the only way that they can be in a \ncomplex society, by [the voters’] power, immediate or remote, over those who make the \n27 \nrule.” Jones v. Governor of Fla., 975 F.3d 1016, 1048 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting Bi-\nMetallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915)) (holding that \n28 \nthere  was  no  due  process  claim  where  legislative  action  changed  voter  registration \nrequirements).  \n  12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 24 of 43\n \n1  the basis of factually barebones records”). Thus, Plaintiffs’ due process claim fails because \n2  there is no deprivation that requires procedural protections.6 \n3  Plaintiffs thus have not stated a due process claim, whether analyzed under the \n4  Anderson-Burdick framework or as a freestanding procedural due process claim.7  \n5  C.  Plaintiffs Have Not Stated an Equal Protection Claim. \n6  Preliminarily, the Anderson-Burdick framework is the proper analytical paradigm \n7  for considering Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims. See Ariz. Democratic Party v. Hobbs \n8  (“Hobbs I”), 976 F.3d 1081, 1086 n.1 (9th Cir. 2020) (“‘[A] single analytic framework’ \n9  applies in voting-rights cases, rather than ‘separate analyses for ... First Amendment, Due \n10  Process, or Equal Protection claims’” (citations omitted)). As discussed above, Plaintiffs \n11  have not stated a claim that HB 2243 and 2492 are unconstitutional under the Anderson-\n12  Burdick framework because they are facially neutral laws that advance legitimate state \n13  interests in voter integrity and modernization that impose minimal burdens, at most. \n   14  However, even setting aside the Anderson-Burdick framework, Plaintiffs have not \n15  stated an equal protection claim. A law complies with the Equal Protection Clause if it is \n16  not facially discriminatory, there is no discriminatory intent, and it has a rational basis. See \n17  Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 271–73 (1979); Commonwealth of Northern \n18  Mariana Islands v. Zhen, 68 F. App’x 7, 8 (9th Cir. 2003) (“[W]e can discern no class-\n19  based claim or allegation of discriminatory application. Accordingly, no cognizable equal \n20  protection claim exists for our review.”).  \n21  First,  Plaintiffs  cannot  establish  facial  discrimination  because  the  challenged \n22  provisions  of  HB  2492  apply  to  all  individuals  registering  to  vote  and  HB  2243’s \n23 \n24 \n \n25  6  Poder Latinx and LUCHA Plaintiffs are wrong that they have stated a procedural due \nprocess claim based on the voter registration process. Neither Poder Latinx nor LUCHA \n26  Plaintiffs cite any case where a court found that denial of voter registration violated \nprocedural due process rights. (Doc. 154 at 8–9; Doc. 150 at 7–9.)  \n27 \n7  Also, “[t]he desire not to be investigated for voter registration fraud is not a fundamental \nright protected by the due process clause.” Moseley, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 397. LUCHA \n28 \nPlaintiffs’ references to possible criminal probes is therefore irrelevant because the State \nis entitled to investigate possible registration fraud. (Doc. 153 at 13.)  \n  13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 25 of 43\n \n1  provisions apply to all registered voters.8 To start, every registrant and registered voter, \n2  including naturalized citizens, can use a driver’s license or identification card number. \n3  A.R.S. § 16-166(F). Solely because those persons can use different documents to establish \n4  POC that might impose slightly different burdens does not create a class based on national \n5  origin or facial discrimination, especially where everyone can use a driver’s license or \n6  identification card number as POC. Lee v. Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 687 (9th Cir. 2001) \n7  (“The  mere  fact  that  defendants’  facially  neutral  policies  had  a  foreseeably \n8  disproportionate impact on an identifiable group does not mean that they violated the Equal \n9  Protection Clause.”). The defining characteristic is whether the person has POC, not \n10  national origin. \n11  LUCHA and AAANHPI contort the State’s explanation regarding the Birthplace \n12  Requirement. (Doc. 153 at 4 n. 5, 13; No. 22-CV-01381, Doc. 89 at 19.) The State did not \n13  say it will apply different standards to birthright citizens. Rather, it stated that providing a \n   14  place of birth offers “additional information [that] facilitates ascertaining if a registrant is \n15  a U.S. citizen.” (Doc. 127 at 32; see also id. at 19 n.6.) It simply makes it easier to identify \n16  an individual, which is why many government forms require birthplace to be specified.  \n17  Second, there is no disparate impact or evidence of discriminatory intent to support \n18  an equal protection claim either. All voter registration applicants must provide POC \n19  through a variety of ways, including providing a driver’s license number or naturalization \n20  certificate number. Plaintiffs have not identified how there is any disparate impact based \n21  on national origin where everyone can establish POC by merely providing a number. In \n22  fact,  HB  2492  and  2243  are  not  yet  in  effect,  so  it  is  impossible  that  they  have  a \n23   \n8  LUCHA’s and AAANHPI’s argument that only naturalized citizens can trigger review \n24  for U.S. citizenship is simply wrong. (Doc. 153 at 13–14 n.8; No. 22-CV-01381, Doc. 89 \nat 19–20.) For example, a U.S. citizen could renounce citizenship, and, if that person was \n25  registered in Arizona and the county recorder obtained information that the registered voter \nrenounced citizenship, the cancelation process for non-citizens under HB 2243 would be \n26 \napplicable regardless of national origin. AAANHPI’s argument that § 2(H) of HB 2243 \nrequires use of the SAVE database to verify citizenship status shows only naturalized \n27 \ncitizens are reviewed gets it backwards. The trigger event is when the county recorder has \n“reason to believe” a registered voter is not a U.S. citizen and that voter lacks POC, not \n28 \nuse of the SAVE database. (No. 22-CV-01381, Doc. 89 at 19–20.) In short, the law is not \ntriggered by national origin and applies the same to every registered voter in Arizona. \n  14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 26 of 43\n \n1  discriminatory effect that would support an equal protection claim. See Am. Motorists Ins. \n2  Co. v. Starnes, 425 U.S. 637, 645 (1976) (“There being no discriminatory effect achieved \n3  by the aspects of the Texas venue provisions calling for establishment of a cause of action, \n4  we  have  no  difficulty  in  concluding  that  appellant’s  equal  protection  challenge  to \n5  Exception 27 must be rejected.”). This deficiency alone is fatal. See id. \n6  In any event, that HB 2243 and 2492 affect some classes differently than others \n7  does not establish an equal protection violation. HB 2243 and 2492 were enacted to combat \n8  voter fraud and safeguard voter confidence in Arizona elections by ensuring all voters are \n9  U.S. citizens that are eligible to vote—unquestionably a legitimate government interest. \n10  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 410. These provisions plainly advance those interests. \n11  Facially  neutral  legislation  that  rationally  furthers  legitimate  government  purposes—\n12  without more—cannot be discriminatory. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 246 \n13  (1976) (holding equal protection claim challenging mandated police officer test failed \n   14  where test was “neutral on its face and rationally may be said to serve a purpose the \n15  Government  is  constitutionally  empowered  to  pursue”).  Indeed,  Plaintiffs  failed  to \n16  adequately plead a discriminatory purpose. McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., No. 08 C \n17  6105, 2011 WL 1196859, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 29, 2011) (“In short, plaintiffs allege that \n18  the system was designed with discriminatory intent, but under Iqbal they must do more. \n19  They  must  plead  sufficient  factual  matter  to  show  that  defendants  adopted  and \n20  implemented  the  retention  system  not  for  a  neutral  reason,  but  for  the  purpose  of \n21  discriminating against African-American [Financial Advisors].”). That the State seeks to \n22  ensure voters are U.S. citizens by requiring POC through a variety of means is an “obvious \n23  alternative explanation” over the “invidious discrimination [Plaintiffs] ask[] us to infer.” \n24  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 681–82 (2009). Thus, as in Iqbal, where a more likely \n25  explanation renders invidious discrimination not plausible, Plaintiffs cannot state an equal \n26  protection claim. See id. \n27  Third, HB 2243 and 2492 easily satisfy the rational basis test. Mi Familia and \n28  LUCHA Plaintiffs assert that a purported difference in treatment between State Form users \n  15 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 27 of 43\n \n1  and Federal Form users violates equal protection. (Doc. 150 at 8–9; Doc. 153 at 14–16). \n2  As an initial matter, Federal Form users are not similarly situated to State Form users \n3  because different qualifications apply for registration. See Chan v. Reno, 113 F.3d 1068, \n4  1073–74  (9th  Cir.  1997)  (stating  that  plaintiffs  were  not  similarly  situated  to  other \n5  applicants where they did not qualify for a visa unlike other applicants).  \n6  Even assuming the two groups are similarly situated, the equal protection claim still \n7  fails. “[T]he Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy \n8  reason for the classification.” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 11 (1992). The State has an \n9  interest in ensuring through POC and POR that individuals registering to vote for state \n10  offices are U.S. citizens and Arizona residents. See Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 404, 409–10 \n11  (citizenship); Marston, 410 U.S. at 679 (residency). The difference in treatment between \n12  Federal Form users and State Form users necessarily arises from the NVRA’s requirement \n13  that the States register Federal Form users to vote for federal offices while also giving the \n   14  States “the flexibility to design and use their own registration forms.” Arizona v. Inter \n15  Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 12, 16–20 (2013). The State’s decision to require \n16  POC for State Form users is a rational exercise of its constitutional authority to add \n17  requirements beyond what the Federal Form requires. See id. Under Plaintiffs’ argument, \n18  States would lack the flexibility to design their own registration forms for state elected \n19  offices and fully federalize voter registration and voter eligibility, a result that grates \n20  against the constitutional framework for elections and the NVRA. Id. at 17 (“Arizona is \n21  correct that it would raise serious constitutional doubts if a federal statute precluded a State \n22  from obtaining the information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications.”). Requiring \n23  POC rationally advances the State’s interest in ensuring that those registering to vote for \n24  state office are qualified to vote as U.S. citizens.  \n25  The State also had a rational basis to distinguish between State Form users and \n26  Federal Form users. The State’s distinction supports the reliance interests of those using \n27  the Federal Form based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Inter Tribal Council restricting \n28  the states from asking for POC for Federal Form users. See Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 14. \n  16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 28 of 43\n \n1  And the State “‘has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a \n2  statutory  classification’;  rather,  ‘[t]he  burden  is  on  the  one  attacking  the  legislative \n3  arrangement to negate every conceivable basis which might support it.’” Erotic Serv. \n4  Provider Legal Educ. & Rsch. Project v. Gascon, 880 F.3d 450, 457 (9th Cir. 2018), \n5  amended, 881 F.3d 792 (9th Cir. 2018). Plaintiffs have not made that showing.9  \n6  MFV Plaintiffs’ assertion that restricting Federal Form users from voting mail or in \n7  presidential elections violates equal protection is also wrong. (Doc. 150 at 9 – 10.) First, \n8  as discussed, Federal Form users are not similarly situated to State Form users because \n9  different qualifications apply. Chan, 113 F.3d at 1073–74. Second, even if Federal Form \n10  and State Form users are similarly situated, there is a rational basis to distinguish between \n11  them based on the different eligibility requirements that apply to each form. See Yao v. \n12  INS, 2 F.3d 317, 322 (9th Cir. 1993). \n13  The minor differences between State Form users and Federal Form users is not \n   14  enough to support an equal protection violation. United States v. Hancock is instructive. \n15  231 F.3d 557 (9th Cir. 2000). There, the Ninth Circuit held that the difference in treatment \n16  between  felons  and  misdemeants  in  regaining  the  right  to  possess  firearms  did  not \n17  constitute an equal protection violation because misdemeants have other adequate paths. \n18  Id. at 567. The Ninth Circuit classified the inability to use “restoration of civil rights” \n19  procedure as a “minor distinction between felons and misdemeants” that did not violate \n \n20 \n9  Poder Latinx’s relies on Louisiana v. United States, (Doc. 154 at 16), but in that case the \nstate  required  voters  to  provide  “‘a  reasonable  interpretation’  of  any  clause  of  the \n21 \nLouisiana Constitution or the Constitution of the United States” without any controls on \nofficial discretion, placing “arbitrary power in the hands of election officers who had used \n22 \n[the requirement] with phenomenal success to” deny the right to vote based on race at the \n23  election officers’ discretion. Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 148, 152 (1965). \nHere, HB 2243 has not even been implemented so there is no history of discriminatory \n24  treatment, unlike in Louisiana. Further, there is no arbitrary power in the county recorders \nto deny any registered voter the ability to vote, unlike in Louisiana. If the county recorder \n25  “obtains information pursuant to this section and confirms that the person registered is not \na United States citizens,” then the county recorder must first provide notice that the \n26 \n“registration will be canceled in thirty five days unless the person provides satisfactory \nevidence of United States citizen pursuant to section 16-166,” HB 2243 § 2(A)(10), which \n27 \nincludes the number from a naturalization certificate, passport, or state driver’s license or \nidentification card. See A.R.S. § 16-166. The requirement to provide a number from a \n28 \ndocument or other documents does not vest arbitrary discretion in county recorders to deny \nthe right to vote, unlike the “interpretation” test from Louisiana.  \n  17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 29 of 43\n \n1  equal protection. See id. Similarly here, Plaintiffs only point to a minor distinction between \n2  Federal Form users and State Form users: State Form users must provide POC while \n3  Federal Form users do not. As discussed, the POC requirement is a minor burden that can \n4  be met through providing either a license number or naturalization certificate number—\n5  not even the documents themselves. As in Hancock, this minor distinction is not enough \n6  to constitute an equal protection violation.10 \n7  In short, Plaintiffs have not alleged an equal protection claim. HB 2492 and 2243 \n8  are facially neutral laws that advance plainly legitimate governmental interests in ensuring \n9  voter integrity. \n10  III.  PLAINTIFFS FAIILED TO STATE VIABLE NVRA CLAIMS \n11  Congress does not have the power to alter the “Places and Manner” of state \n12  elections. The NVRA thus could not possibly apply to state elections. No party disputes \n13  that logic. Likewise, Congress does not have the power to alter the “Places and Manner” \n   14  of presidential elections. By the same logic, the NVRA cannot apply to presidential \n15  elections. The Elections Clause permits Congress to regulate the “Times, Places and \n16  Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. \n17  1. It does not apply to presidential elections, just as it does not apply to state elections. \n18  The Electors Clause of Article II grants state legislatures the power to appoint presidential \n19  electors, yet it notably omits any similar power for Congress. “It is difficult to see how \n20  words could be clearer in stating what Congress can control and what it cannot control.” \n21  Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 210 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting \n22  in part). And because the NVRA does not apply to presidential or state elections, it cannot \n23  preempt the Acts in question. \n24  The United States nevertheless urges the Court to ignore the Elections Clause’s \n25 \n \n26  10  Plaintiffs’ citation to Bush v. Gore is unavailing. (Doc. 154 at 16–18). Bush v. Gore \ndealt with a voter dilution claim where there was express disparate treatment in how votes \n27 \nwere counted in different counties across the state under an order from the state supreme \ncourt. 531 U.S. 98, 107 (2000). Here, as discussed, there is no disparate treatment—\n28 \neveryone registering to vote can either select the State Form or Federal Form and the same \nrequirements apply to everyone based on the form selected.  \n  18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 30 of 43\n \n1  omission of presidential elections. The United States attributes that omission to the \n2  Framers not anticipating “that a presidential election would be conducted by popular vote \n3  in the way it is now.” USA Resp. 8. But presidential elections are not conducted by popular \n4  vote. Today, just as at the time of the Founding, an electoral college selects the president. \n5  And though “Congress may determine the Time” of appointing presidential electors, the \n6  States have always had exclusive authority over the “Manner” of appointing them. U.S. \n7  Const. art. II, § 1. So the United States’ premise is simply wrong.  \n8  Moreover, the United States’ argument proves too much. The U.S. admits that the \n9  omission of presidential elections from the Elections Clause was important, but it can \n10  point to no change in the Constitution undoing that important choice. The Elections Clause \n11  itself has not changed, and election-related amendments only underscore the Elections \n12  Clause’s resilience. Contra USA Resp. 8-9. The Constitution carefully assigns election-\n13  related  powers,  and  nothing  in  it  gives  Congress  blanket  authority  to  regulate  the \n   14  “Manner” of selecting presidential electors. That power remains with the States.11 \n15  The Court must apply the Constitution’s text. The United States’ meager attempt \n16  to deal with the text is untenable. But even that exceeds Private Plaintiffs’, who don’t even \n17  try. In fact, LUCHA claims that none of its claims “depend on applying the NVRA to \n18  presidential election.” LUCHA Resp. 9. If that is true, the Court should dismiss the NVRA \n19  preemption claims on that ground alone, because HB 2492 applies only to state and \n20  presidential elections. Rather than deal with the text of the Elections Clause, Private \n21  Plaintiffs obscure the Constitution’s plain meaning with inapplicable precedent. The \n22  words  of  the  Constitution  cut  through  their  arguments,  and  the  Court  should  reject \n23  Plaintiffs’ attempts to deviate from the text. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n11  Congress does have limited power to regulate presidential elections to protect “the right \n27 \nof citizens of the United States to vote” under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. \nBut those amendments did not erase the States’ authority to regulate the manner of \n28 \nchoosing presidential electors. U.S. Const. art. II, § 1. In any event, Congress did not enact \nthe NVRA under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, as explained infra §III.B.  \n  19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 31 of 43\n \n1  A.  Congress does not have unbounded authority to regulate presidential \nelections. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs argue that Congress wields expansive power to regulate presidential \n4  elections. USA Resp. 6-9; DNC Resp. 5-6. But in none of the cases plaintiffs cite did the \n5  Supreme Court hold that Congress may alter the “Places and Manner” of presidential \n6  elections. In Burroughs v. United States, the Court held that the Federal Corrupt Practices \n7  Act did not violate the Electors Clause because “[n]either in purpose nor in effect does \n8  [the act] interfere with the power of a state to appoint electors or the manner in which their \n9  appointment shall be made.” 290 U.S. 534, 544 (1934). The Court did not hold that \n10  Congress possesses power to regulate the “Places and Manner” of presidential elections. \n11  To the contrary, the quoted line assumes that a statute that does interfere with the States’ \n12  authority over presidential elections is unconstitutional. \n13  Plaintiffs’ other cases are similarly inapplicable. Plaintiffs cite Buckley v. Valeo for \n   14  the proposition that the Constitution gives “broad congressional power” over presidential \n15  elections. 424 U.S. 1, 14 n.16 (1976) (citing Burroughs, 290 U.S. 534). But the Court in \n16  Buckley merely addressed whether the Federal Election Campaign Act’s regulations of \n17  campaign  contributions  and  expenses  violated  the  First  Amendment  and  the  Equal \n18  Protection Clause. Id. at 7-11. The Court discussed the Elections Clause only in passing. \n19  See id. at 131-32. Even then, the Court recognized that Congress’s authority to regulate \n20  congressional elections must “not offend some other constitutional restriction,” such as \n21  those “stemming from the separation of powers.” Id. at 132. The authority of the States to \n22  regulate the manner of choosing presidential electors is just such a restriction. U.S. Const. \n23  art. II, § 1.  \n24  Plaintiffs’ reliance on Justice Black’s solo opinion in Oregon v. Mitchell is even \n25  less persuasive. Justice Black, “in an opinion expressing his own view of the cases,” \n26  summarily  dismissed  any  difference  between  Congress’s  power  over  congressional \n27  elections and its power over presidential elections. 400 U.S. at 117, 124 (op. of Black, J.). \n28  But his opinion does not reconcile the textual difference between the Elections Clause and \n  20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 32 of 43\n \n1  the Electors Clause. Justice Harlan, who actually analyzed the text, observed that “the \n2  power to control the ‘Manner’ of holding elections, given with respect to congressional \n3  elections by Art. I, s 4, is absent with respect to the selection of presidential electors.” Id. \n4  211 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Thus, “the fact that it was \n5  deemed necessary to provide separately for congressional power to regulate the time of \n6  choosing presidential electors and the President himself demonstrates that the power over \n7  ‘Times, Places and Manner’ given by Art. I, s 4, does not refer to presidential elections, \n8  but only to the elections for Congressmen.” Id. at 211-12.  \n9  The circuit cases plaintiffs rely on likewise do not support their claims. See Voting \n10  Rights Coal. v. Wilson, 60 F.3d 1411, 1414-15 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that the NVRA \n11  was not an unconstitutional usurpation of the State’s authority to regulate congressional \n12  elections); ACORN v. Miller, 129 F.3d 833, 836-38 (6th Cir. 1996) (same); ACORN v. \n13  Edgar, 56 F.3d 791, 793 (7th Cir. 1995) (same). The closest plaintiffs come is some dicta \n   14  misreading Burroughs. See ACORN, 129 F.3d at 836 n.1 (citing Burroughs for the \n15  proposition that “Congress has been granted authority to regulate presidential elections”). \n16  Plaintiffs’ out-of-context invocations of “broad congressional power” over presidential \n17  elections cannot override the Constitution’s plain text. Congress can regulate the “Places \n18  and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,” but not Presidents. \n19  U.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1.  \n20  In a last-ditch effort to salvage their expansive reading, Plaintiffs invoke the \n21  Necessary and Proper Clause. USA Resp. 9; see also DNC Resp. 7. Plaintiffs’ only \n22  support for that argument is United States v. Comstock, 560 U.S. 126, 133 (2010), which \n23  has nothing to do with elections, and Justice Black’s reasoning in Mitchell, which obtained \n24  no  other  Justice’s  support.  Plaintiffs’  weakly  supported  argument  is  also  weakly \n25  explained.  The  United  States  says  treating  presidential  elections  differently  than \n26  congressional  elections  would  result  in  “dual  and  disparate  processes”  for  federal \n27  elections. USA Resp. 9. But the Constitution explicitly designed dual and disparate \n28  processes  for  presidential  and  congressional  elections.  Moreover,  no  Plaintiff  even \n  21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 33 of 43\n \n1  attempts to explain how proof of citizenship is remotely related to the “Timing” of \n2  presidential  elections,  let  alone  convenient,  useful,  or  conducive  to  the  “beneficial \n3  exercise” of that power. M’Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 417-18 (1819). \n4  Regardless, even if the Necessary and Proper Clause were read as Plaintiffs suggest, \n5  Congress can exercise its authority over federal elections only “so long as the exercise of \n6  that authority does not offend some other constitutional restriction.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at \n7  132. To the extent the NVRA regulates the “Manner” of selecting presidential electors, it \n8  offends the power of the States under the Electors Clause. \n9  B.  The NVRA is not an exercise of Congress’s authority under the \nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments \n10 \n11  Because the Elections Clause plainly forecloses their arguments, plaintiffs retreat \n12  to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. They claim that Congress enacted the \n13  NVRA  to  combat  racial  discrimination  under  its  remedial  authority  to  enforce  the \n   14  Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, rather than under the Elections Clause. See U.S. \n15  Resp. 9-11; DNC Resp. 8. To show that a law is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s \n16  remedial powers, plaintiffs must demonstrate “congruence and proportionality between \n17  the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.” City of Boerne \n18  v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997). Plaintiffs argue they need only show that Congress \n19  used “rational means” to prevent discrimination. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. \n20  301, 324 (1966). Regardless, the NVRA fails both tests. See Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. \n21  No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 204 (2009) (acknowledging, though not resolving, the \n22  two different tests). \n23  The Court need apply either test, however, because plaintiffs have not shown that \n24  Congress enacted the NVRA under its remedial powers in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth \n25  Amendments. The only textual support that plaintiffs can muster is Congress’s finding \n26  that “discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can … disproportionately \n27  harm  voter  participation  by  various  groups,  including  racial  minorities.”  52  U.S.C. \n28  § 20501(a)(3).  And  plaintiffs  prop  up  that  single  line  with  sparse  references  to  the \n  22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 34 of 43\n \n1  congressional record. See USA Resp. 10; DNC Resp. 8. But those findings are plainly \n2  insufficient under Supreme Court precedent. The NVRA’s congressional record consists \n3  of nothing more than a handful of conclusory statements that “discriminatory and unfair \n4  practices still exist and deprive some citizens of their right to vote.” S. Rep. 103-6, at 3, \n5  17-18 (1993). The NVRA’s “legislative record lacks examples of modern instances” of \n6  discrimination on account of proof of citizenship required for registration. City of Boerne, \n7  521 U.S. at 530. The dearth of legislative history documenting racial discrimination on \n8  account of proof of citizenship is no surprise, since “many of the first generation barriers \n9  to minority voter registration and voter turnout that were in place prior to the [Voting \n10  Rights Act] have been eliminated.” Nw. Austin, 557 U.S. at 201-02, 227 (cleaned up). \n11  Compared  to  the  NVRA,  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act  contained  more \n12  extensive legislative findings of past discrimination. But the Supreme Court still found a \n13  “lack of support in the legislative record” that would have justified the law as an exercise \n   14  of Congress’s power under the Fourteenth Amendment. City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 531. \n15  The NVRA lacks findings of either past or present discrimination and thus “cannot be \n16  considered remedial, preventive legislation.” Id. at 532  \n17  Even if Congress had passed the NVRA as an exercise of its remedial power, the \n18  NVRA is not tailored to remedying discrimination. Given the lack of legislative findings, \n19  it is difficult even to discern the NVRA’s “supposed remedial or preventive object.” Id. at \n20  532. But assuming the NVRA’s object is to combat “discriminatory and unfair registration \n21  laws,” it is not tailored to achieving that object. 52 U.S.C. § 20501(a)(3). For one, the \n22  NVRA completely ignores the “dramatic improvements” to racial disparities in voter \n23  registration and summarily dismisses the “historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights \n24  Act.” Nw. Austin, 557 U.S. at 201–02; see S. Rep. 103-6, at 3, 17-18; H. Rep. 103-9, at \n25  105, 106-07 (1993). For another, the NVRA (unlike the Voting Rights Act) does not apply \n26  to state elections, demonstrating that it was not truly aimed at remedying discrimination \n27  in voter registration. An over- and under-inclusive law, the NVRA “is so out of proportion \n28  to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, \n  23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 35 of 43\n \n1  or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532. \n2  The United States brushes aside those Supreme Court cases with no meaningful \n3  discussion. The other plaintiffs do not even mention them. Instead, they rely on outdated, \n4  nonbinding district court cases. See Condon v. Reno, 913 F. Supp. 946, 962 (D.S.C. 1995); \n5  ACORN v. Edgar, 880 F. Supp. 1215, 1221 (N.D. Ill. 1995); ACORN v. Miller, 912 F. \n6  Supp. 976, 984 (W.D. Mich. 1995). Those cases are wrong, for the reasons explained in \n7  this section. And they were all decided before the Supreme Court’s decisions in City of \n8  Boerne and Northwest Austin, which critically undermine their analysis. In any event, the \n9  NVRA “imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.” Shelby County \n10  v.  Holder,  570  U.S.  529,  542  (2013).  Plaintiffs  urge  the  Court  to  follow  outdated, \n11  nonbinding district court opinions. Instead, the Court should apply current Supreme Court \n12  doctrine to analyze the NVRA today. Under that standard, the NVRA is plainly not an \n13  exercise of Congress’s powers under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. \n   14  C.  HB 2492 does not apply to federal congressional elections. \n15  DNC also argues even if the NVRA applies only to federal congressional elections, \n16  “H.B. 2492 would still be preempted as to congressional elections.” DNC Resp. 5. But \n17  DNC badly misreads HB 2492. Its plain text is clear that the act does not apply to \n18  congressional elections and thus does not conflict with the NVRA. HB 2492 states that an \n19  “applicant will not be qualified to vote in a presidential election or by mail with an early \n20  ballot in any election until satisfactory evidence of citizenship is provided.” HB 2492 \n21  § 4(E). DNC seizes on the words “any election” but ignores (and omits from its quotation) \n22  all other words in that provision. DNC Resp. 5. The statute plainly applies to (1) voting in \n23  “a presidential election,” and (2) voting in any election “by mail with an early ballot.” HB \n24  2492 § 4(E). As to the former, the NVRA cannot constitutionally apply to presidential \n25  elections, as explained above and previously. As to the latter, the NVRA covers “voter \n26  registration.” 52 U.S.C. § 20503(a). It sets no rules regarding mail-in ballot applications, \n27  so there is no conflict with the NVRA in requiring mail-in voters to submit POC. HB 2492 \n28  thus falls outside the NVRA’s boundaries, as the Arizona legislature intended. \n  24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 36 of 43\n \n1  D.  Plaintiffs’ other NVRA claims fail as a matter of law. \n2  The Court can dismiss plaintiffs’ NVRA claims simply by construing the NVRA \n3  to avoid conflict with the Elections and Electors Clauses. The NVRA applies to federal \n4  congressional elections, and HB 2492 applies only to presidential and state elections. The \n5  NVRA thus cannot preempt HB 2492. In addition, plaintiffs’ NVRA claims suffer from \n6  other infirmities that plaintiffs do not mend.  \n7  First, HB 2492 is uniform and nondiscriminatory. The statute requires proof of \n8  citizenship for all voters; it does not create classes of voters or discriminate against any \n9  type of voter. DNC argues that discrimination means treating applicants who attested to \n10  citizenship under the federal form differently than those who offered proof of citizenship \n11  under the state form. DNC Resp. 9. But that makes no sense. Nondiscrimination in the \n12  election context has always meant that States must apply “uniform statewide rules.” \n13  Lemons v. Bradbury, 538 F.3d 1098, 1105 (9th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added). Under \n   14  DNC’s reading, no state maintenance program could ever be “uniform” with federal law \n15  because all maintenance programs necessarily require something different from or in \n16  addition to federal law. But States are “free to take reasonable steps … to see that all \n17  applicants  for  registration  to  vote  actually  fulfill”  the  State’s  qualifications.  Bell  v. \n18  Marinko, 367 F.3d 588, 592 (6th Cir. 2004). HB 2492 applies equally to all Arizona voters. \n19  It is thus uniform and nondiscriminatory. \n20  Second, HB 2492 does not require county recorders to remove voters from the rolls \n21  within “90 days” of a federal election. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(c)(2)(A). DNC argues that HB \n22  2492 does not put a time limit on removing voters from the rolls, but that is irrelevant. See \n23  DNC Resp. 10. Plaintiffs challenge HB 2492 on its face, so they must show “that the law \n24  is  unconstitutional  in  all  of  its  applications.”  Wash.  State  Grange  v.  Wash.  State \n25  Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449 (2008). But county recorders can clearly comply \n26  with both HB 2492 and the NVRA: they “shall” remove ineligible voters from the rolls, \n27  HB 2492 § 8, and they must “complete” that process within 90 days of a federal election, \n28  52 U.S.C. § 20507(c)(2)(A). The laws do not conflict. \n  25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 37 of 43\n \n1  As for the remaining claims, Plaintiffs all but admit they should be dismissed. The \n2  State argued that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ NVRA registration claims because \n3  Arizona already complies with those registration provisions. See MTD 24. DNC responds \n4  that “none of the complaints here claims that H.B. 2492 violates the NVRA because it \n5  prohibits all registrations at [NVRA-mandated] agencies.” DNC Resp. 17. Whatever the \n6  reason Plaintiffs included those provisions in their claims, they are now disclaiming them. \n7  The Court should thus dismiss them.  \n8  IV.  PLAINTIFFS’ SECTION 10101 CLAIMS FAIL \n9  A.  Private Plaintiffs Lack A Cause Of Action  \n10  Plaintiffs insist that Section 10101 creates a private right of action enforceable in \n11  federal  court.  MFV  argues  that  the  U.S.  Attorney  General’s  enforcement  power  is \n12  compatible with private enforcement. MFV Resp. 9 (citing Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 \n13  U.S. 273, 284 n.4 (2002)). But Plaintiffs overlook the comprehensive nature of that \n   14  enforcement power. Reading the statute as a whole, it is clear that “Congress created ‘a \n15  comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement.’” \n16  Watson v. Weeks, 436 F.3d 1152, 1158-59 (9th Cir. 2006). Plaintiffs do not address the \n17  comprehensive detail in the statute, which dictates who can be the defendant, creates \n18  special forms of relief, sets rebuttable evidentiary presumptions, creates new federal \n19  jurisdiction,  eliminates  exhaustion  requirements,  provides  for  the  appointment  and \n20  compensation of private referees, specifies fast deadlines, assigns counsel to defendants, \n21  and creates jurisdiction for three-judge district courts and direct appeals to the Supreme \n22  Court. 52 U.S.C. § 10101(c)-(g). Plaintiffs myopically focus on the words “no person” and \n23  “shall” while ignoring the six other subsections in the statute. MFV Resp. 8-10. Those \n24  sections show that, unlike Title VI and Title IX, Section 10101 creates a “comprehensive \n25  remedial scheme” demonstrating that Congress did not intend a private right of action. \n26  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 258 (2009). Many courts agree.12  \n27 \n \n28  12 See, e.g., Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, 837 F.3d 612, 630 (6th Cir. 2016); \nDekom v. New York, 2013 WL 3095010, at *18 (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2013), aff’d, 583 F. \nApp’x 15 (2d Cir. 2014); Hayden v. Pataki, 2004 WL 1335921, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, \n  26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 38 of 43\n \n1  B.  Plaintiffs Fail To Allege Violations Of The Materiality Provision \n2  Plaintiffs fundamentally misunderstand the Voting Rights Act. The materiality \n3  provision “was intended to address the practice of requiring unnecessary information for \n4  voter registration with the intent that such requirements would increase the number of \n5  errors or omissions on the application forms, thus providing an excuse to disqualify \n6  potential voters.” Schwier v. Cox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1294 (11th Cir. 2003). For example, one \n7  unlawful practice was to “disqualify an applicant who failed to list the exact number of \n8  months and days in his age.” Id. (cleaned up). Plaintiffs allege no such practice. Instead, \n9  plaintiffs claim that traditional, obviously relevant information such as proof of citizenship \n10  and residence is immaterial under state law.  \n11  Plaintiffs  conflate  voter  eligibility  with  voter  qualifications.  Arizona  has \n12  determined that providing birthplace, proof of citizenship, and proof of residence are \n13  qualifications “under State law.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B). A voter’s failure to provide \n   14  those things is clearly an “error” or “omission” material to meeting those qualifications. \n15  For example, in Martin v. Crittenden, a voter’s failure to provide her birthyear was an \n16  immaterial omission because Georgia law required birth year only when necessary to \n17  confirm the identity of the voter. 347 F. Supp. 3d 1302, 1306 (N.D. Ga. 2018). Some \n18  Georgia counties required a birthyear, and others did not. Id. The counties requiring a \n19  birthyear  demanded  something  beyond  what  Georgia  law  required,  which  is  why \n20  omissions of that information were not “material” to a voter’s qualifications. Id. Here, \n21  Arizona law requires birthplace, proof of citizenship, and proof of residence. Errors or \n22  omissions concerning those qualifications are necessarily “material” under state law.  \n23    The Acts also do not automatically “[d]eny the right of any individual to vote in \n24  any election.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B). An application lacking satisfactory evidence \n25  of citizenship triggers a notice and opportunity to cure, not an outright rejection. HB 2492 \n26  § 4(C);  A.R.S.  § 16-134(B).  The  only  circuit  to  address  the  issue  has  held  that  an \n27  individual’s right to vote is not denied when there is an opportunity to cure. Vote.Org v. \n \n28 \n2004); Willing v. Lake Orion Cmty. Sch. Bd. of Trustees, 924 F. Supp. 815, 820 (E.D. \nMich. 1996); Spivey v. Ohio, 999 F. Supp. 987, 996 (N.D. Ohio 1998). \n  27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 39 of 43\n \n1  Callanen, 39 F.4th 297, 306 (5th Cir. 2022). That makes sense, because otherwise “an \n2  individual’s failure to comply with any registration requirement would deprive that person \n3  of the right to vote.” Id. \n4  In any event, the errors and omissions Plaintiffs complain of are material to whether \n5  an individual is qualified to vote under Arizona law. The United States says that some \n6  courts have used a heightened materiality standard. See USA Resp. 18. But other courts \n7  have not, including those in Arizona. E.g., Gonzalez v. Arizona, No. 06-CV-1268, 2007 \n8  WL 9724581, at *2 (D. Ariz. Aug. 28, 2007); Diaz v. Cobb, 435 F. Supp. 2d 1206, 1213 \n9  (S.D. Fla. 2006). More importantly, plaintiffs provide no reason why the Court should \n10  ignore the plain meaning of “material,” which simply requires “[h]aving some logical \n11  connection with the consequential facts.” Material, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. \n12  2019). The United States cites cases concerning whether certain evidence is material to \n13  decision-making by judges, jurors, and administrators. USA Resp. 19. But those cases use \n   14  “material” in a different sense: “Of such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect \n15  a person’s decision-making.” Material, Black’s Law Dictionary (emphasis added). The \n16  Acts request information to ascertain essential facts about the voter; the United States’ \n17  analogy to discretionary decision-making makes no sense. \n18  The Acts require information material to a voter’s qualifications. The United States \n19  concedes that citizenship and residence are essential voter qualifications. See USA Resp. \n20  15. Birthplace, proof of citizenship, and proof of residence have at least “some logical \n21  connection with [those] consequential facts.” Material, Black’s Law Dictionary. The \n22  United  States  argues  that  birthplace  has  no  bearing  on  voter  qualifications,  but  its \n23  examples prove otherwise. The United States points to a vanishingly small category of \n24  people who are born in the United States and are not citizens. See USA Resp. 18-19. But \n25  that example proves the rule that birthplace is directly relevant to citizenship for most \n26  voters. Thus, for all voters, listing their birthplace will help streamline the process of \n27  ascertaining whether they are citizens, and what documents might demonstrate their \n28  citizenship. Plaintiffs say that some voters will have unique circumstances explaining why \n  28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 40 of 43\n \n1  they may not have certain information or documents. But that is precisely why the Act \n2  gathers a variety of information with “some logical connection” to voter qualifications. \n3  That information is not duplicative and, even if it were, it would not “become[] immaterial \n4  due solely to its repetition.” Diaz, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 1213. \n5  C.  Plaintiffs fail to allege a violation of the discrimination provision. \n6  Plaintiffs’ claims that the Acts violate Section 10101’s discrimination provision \n7  suffer from similar deficiencies. The requirements of the Acts are uniform—they do not \n8  apply  any  “standard,  practice,  or  procedure”  that  is  “different  from  the  standards, \n9  practices, or procedures applied under such law or laws to other individuals within the \n10  same ... political subdivision.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A). Plaintiffs incorrectly claim \n11  that the Acts are “much like the laws blocked in Shivelhood and Frazier.” Poder Resp. 6. \n12  But the court in Shivelhood merely ruled that a city could not require students to fill out a \n13  supplemental domicile questionnaire “unless all applicants are required to complete the \n   14  same  questionnaire.”  Shivelhood  v.  Davis,  336  F.  Supp.  1111,  1115  (D.  Vt.  1971) \n15  (emphasis added). And Frazier concerned blatant racial discrimination by an election \n16  registrar who was applying different registration standards to black college students \n17  compared to all other voters. Frazier v. Callicutt, 383 F. Supp. 15, 19 (N.D. Miss. 1974).  \n18  This case is nothing like Shivelhood or Frazier. The Acts here impose uniform \n19  requirements across all groups. Plaintiffs complain that county recorders might treat \n20  individuals differently. Poder Resp. 5-7. But that claim “rest[s] on speculation” that cannot \n21  support plaintiffs’ facial challenge. Wash. State Grange, 552 U.S. at 450. To survive \n22  dismissal, plaintiffs must show “that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.” \n23  Id. at 449. Plaintiffs cannot invalidate state law on its face simply because an election \n24  official might one day exceed his statutory authority or treat applicants differently. Those \n25  are precisely the sort of “‘hypothetical’ or ‘imaginary’ cases” inappropriate for facial \n26  challenges. Id. at 450. Plaintiffs thus fail to state a claim under §10101. \n27  V.  LUCHA’s VRA § 2 CLAIM FAILS \n28  Most of LUCHA’s VRA §2 arguments (at 9-10) consist of its contentions that the \n  29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 41 of 43\n \n1  burdens at issue here are substantial. Those fail for the reasons explained previously and \n2  above, particularly under Crawford. See MTD at 14-16, 30; supra §II.A. \n3  Nor  does  LUCHA  respond  to  the  State’s  argument  that  “Brnovich  requires \n4  consideration  of  ‘the  strength  of  the  state  interests,’  which  are  compelling  here  as \n5  explained above and in Crawford and Gonzalez.” MTD at 29 (citation omitted). Indeed, \n6  LUCHA’s response ignores the State’s interest entirely, thereby waiving any argument on \n7  that factor. \n8  More fundamentally, LUCHA fails to grapple with the central problem of its VRA \n9  allegations: the complete absence of any detail about the magnitude of disparate impacts. \n10  MTD at 29-30. LUCHA’s claim literally only says that “the law will not equally affect \n11  Arizona residents writ large.” LUCHA FAC ¶369 (emphasis added). But that is a universal \n12  feature of nearly every election law every devised by human beings: “it [is] virtually \n13  impossible for a State to devise rules that do not have some disparate impact.” Brnovich v. \n   14  DNC, 141 S. Ct. 2343 (2021) (emphasis added); MTD at 29. In essence, LUCHA has not \n15  alleged anything more than that HB 2492 is just like nearly every election law that has \n16  ever proceeded it. That does not suffice to allege a violation of §2. \n17  The Federal Rules “do[] not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with \n18  nothing more than conclusions.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79 (2009). And given the complete \n19  absence of any detail about the magnitude of the disparate impacts, conclusions are all that \n20  LUCHA offers here. LUCHA thus falls well short of crossing “the line from conceivable \n21  to plausible.’” Id. at 683 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  \n22  *   *   * \n23  LUCHA is indeed correct that it “need not ‘prove their case at the pleading stage.’” \n24  LUCHA Resp. 10 (citation omitted). But it was required to allege plausibly a violation of \n25  section 2 of the VRA under Iqbal and Twombly. Its complaint failed to do so here. \n26  CONCLUSION \n27  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Complaints should be dismissed. \n28     \n  30 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 180   Filed 11/23/22   Page 42 of 43\n \n1  Respectfully submitted this 23rd day of November, 2022. \n2   \n3  MARK BRNOVICH \nATTORNEY GENERAL \n4 \n \nBy: s/ Drew C.

This  is  an  action  brought  under  the  U.S.  Constitution  to  safeguard  the \n88  \nfundamental rights of hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, including the right to vote and \n99  \nthe state-protected right to vote early by mail, which are subject to due process protections. \n1100  \n“No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of \n1111  \nthose who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even \n1122  \nthe most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 \n1133  \nU.S. 1, 17 (1964). In this action, Plaintiffs challenge Arizona’s latest effort to undermine \n1144  \nthat most precious right: the recently enacted H.B. 2492, which severely burdens the right \n1155   to vote and, in many cases, will deny that right entirely, disenfranchising eligible, lawful \n1166   voters  in  violation  of  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments,  the  National  Voter \n1177   Registration Act of 1993 (“NVRA”), and the “Materiality Provision” of Section 101 of the \n1188   Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \n2.  Arizona has a long and complex history of applying different registration and \n1199  \nvoting requirements to different voters, which has caused portions of its law to be held in \n2200  \nviolation of federal law and has required the State to enter into an ongoing consent decree. \n2211  \nSee Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 15 (2013); Consent Decree \n2222  \nat 7-16, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-cv-04102-DGC (D. Ariz. June 18, 2018), ECF No. \n2233  \n37 (“Consent Decree”). The result is a byzantine system in which Arizona has three classes \n2244  \nof voters: (1) those who registered pre-2005 and did not have to show documentary proof \n2255  \nof citizenship (because Arizona did not yet require it), who can vote in all elections; (2) \n2266  \nthose who registered post-2005 using the federal form required by the NVRA (the “Federal \n2277  \nForm”) and did not show documentary proof of citizenship, who can vote only in federal \n2288  \nelections;  and  (3)  those  who  registered  post-2005  and  showed  adequate  proof  of \n  \n-1- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 4 of 29\n \n11   citizenship, who can vote in all elections. All of these voters are entitled to vote in elections \n22   for which they are qualified by mail, a right which Arizona has provided to all voters for \n33   any reason since 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. Further, under the ongoing consent decree, \n44   the state must (1) treat all registrants the same regardless of whether they use the state form \nor Federal Form, registering all voters for federal elections regardless of provided evidence \n55  \nof citizenship; and (2) check the motor vehicles database for citizenship documentation \n66  \nbefore limiting voters to federal-only elections. See Consent Decree at 7-16. \n77  \n3.  H.B. 2492 (the “Proof of Citizenship Restriction”), which was signed into \n88  \nlaw  on  March  30,  2022,  adds  another  confusing,  discriminatory,  unnecessary,  and \n99  \nunconstitutional impediment to this morass. Among other things, the Proof of Citizenship \n1100  \nRestriction  will  (1)  prohibit  new  registrants  using  the  Federal  Form  from  voting  in \n1111  \npresidential elections or voting by mail in elections for any office unless they provide \n1122  \nadditional documentation, (2) prohibit currently registered voters who registered using the \n1133  \nFederal Form without proof of citizenship from voting in presidential elections or voting \n1144  \nby mail for any office, and (3) prohibit long-registered Arizona voters who never had to \n1155   provide proof of citizenship—estimated to be close to 200,000 voters1—from voting in \n1166   presidential elections, unless they locate and present additional documentation. The law \n1177   provides no details concerning how long-registered voters will be notified that they must \n1188   provide new documents, or how they will be given an opportunity to do so. The new law \nalso requires the Attorney General to investigate and potentially prosecute voters who \n1199  \nregistered without providing what the statute deems satisfactory proof of citizenship.2 H.B. \n2200  \n \n2211  \n1 See Laurie Roberts, Republicans want HOW MANY Arizonans to prove they have a right \n2222   to  vote?,  Ariz.

The  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  continues  a  baseless  assault  on \n33   Arizona’s elections based on a conspiracy theory that non-citizens are voting, despite a \n44   persistent lack of credible evidence to support such claims. It is the newest in a series of \ncynical and bad faith attempts to use these politically motivated and false allegations to \n55  \nlimit access to voting by eligible, lawful citizens. And the new law’s limitations on early \n66  \nvoting are particularly pernicious given the prevalence of early voting by mail in Arizona. \n77  \nIn 2020, a record-setting 88 percent of voters used Arizona’s early voting by mail system \n88  \nto cast their ballots. But, even before the pandemic, early voting was the most common \n99  \nform of voting in the state. In 2016, over 2 million Arizona voters—or about 75 percent of \n1100  \nthose who participated in the election—used early voting. Even in 2008, more than a \n1111  \nmillion voters—or close to half of those participating—used early voting. And, as more \n1122  \nvoters  have  turned  to  early  voting  by  mail,  Arizona’s  election  administrators  have \n1133  \nresponded by diverting their resources to support mail-in voting, anticipating that the \n1144  \noverwhelming majority of Arizona voters will exercise their right to vote by mail. As a \n1155   result, in-person voting facilities and opportunities have dramatically decreased.  \n1166   5.  In other words, Arizona’s voting system has been oriented toward supporting \n1177   and facilitating early mail voters for decades. It was well tested and well established. There \n1188   is no evidence that it was undermined or even vulnerable to abuse or fraud. Quite to the \ncontrary, both Governor Doug Ducey and Secretary Hobbs have repeatedly assured the \n1199  \npublic and the nation that false claims about the legitimacy of Arizona’s 2020 election are \n2200  \nto be rejected, that the election was secure and fraud-free, and that the results should be \n2211  \ntrusted. As Governor Ducey emphasized in response to attacks on the integrity of the 2020 \n2222  \n2233  \n \nnumber or presentation to the county recorder of the applicant's United States passport; (4) a \n2244  \npresentation to the county recorder of the applicant's United States naturalization documents or \n2255   the number of the certificate of naturalization. If only the number of the certificate of \nnaturalization is provided, the applicant shall not be included in the registration rolls until the \n2266  \nnumber of the certificate of naturalization is verified with the United States immigration and \nnaturalization service by the county recorder; (5) other documents or methods of proof that are \n2277  \nestablished pursuant to the immigration reform and control act of 1986; and (6) the applicant's \nbureau of Indian affairs card number, tribal treaty card number or tribal enrollment number. \n2288  \n3 See S.B. 1638 § 4, 55th Leg., 2d Reg.

Despite these assurances, multiple lawsuits and contests brought by the \n44   Republican Party, former President Donald Trump’s campaign, and their supporters have \nsought to cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 election. Arizona’s state and federal courts \n55  \nresponded by rejecting those suits and repudiated their champions for their striking lack of \n66  \nevidence. For example, in a case brought by the Arizona Republican Party to challenge the \n77  \nlegitimacy of Maricopa County’s audit, the Superior Court ordered the party to pay \n88  \nattorney’s fees to the Secretary of State under A.R.S. § 12-349 because the lawsuit was \n99  \n“groundless,” brought in “bad faith,” and served only to “cast false shadows on the \n1100  \nelection’s legitimacy.” Order at 9-10, Ariz. Republican Party v. Fontes, No. CV 2020-\n1111  \n014553 (Ariz. Super. Ct. Mar. 12, 2021). \n1122  \n7.  The same false narratives sowed the groundwork for the Proof of Citizenship \n1133  \nRestriction, and now, as a result, tens of thousands of Arizonans will be forced to jump \n1144  \nthrough unnecessary hoops to access the mail voting system upon which they have come \n1155   to rely, and to vote in presidential elections whether by mail or in person. Some of those \n1166   lawful,  eligible  Arizona  voters  will  be  unable  to  clear  the  Restriction’s  hurdles.  As \n1177   manifested by state officials’ full-throated defense of Arizona’s election system in the \n1188   immediate aftermath of the November 2020 election, as well as multiple court decisions \nrelated to the same, there are no state interests, much less compelling ones, to justify the \n1199  \nnew imposition of these unjustifiable and disparate burdens. There is no evidence that any \n2200  \nof Arizona’s voting methods are beset by fraud, and no credible evidence that non-citizens \n2211  \nare attempting to overcome (much less actually overcoming) the numerous safeguards \n2222  \nArizona already had in place to limit voting in Arizona to United States citizens. The Proof \n2233  \nof Citizenship Restriction is an entirely illegitimate and unconstitutional roadblock erected \n2244  \nin the path of lawful, eligible voters. For these reasons and those detailed below, Plaintiffs \n2255  \nrespectfully  request  a  declaration  that  the  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  is \n2266  \nunconstitutional and violates the NVRA and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and an order \n2277  \n \n4  @DougDucey,  Twitter  (Nov.  30,  2020,  9:48  PM) \n2288  \nhttps://twitter.com/dougducey/status/1333603891863191552? ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw. \n  \n-4- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 7 of 29\n \n11   enjoining its enforcement. \n22   JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n33   8.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 and 52 \n44   U.S.C. §§ 20510 and 10101(d) to redress the deprivation, under the color of state law, of \ntheir rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, the \n55  \nNVRA, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n66  \n9.  Plaintiffs sent Secretary Hobbs detailed written notices of these violations of \n77  \nthe NVRA on April 7, 2022, and she failed to correct the violations alleged herein within \n88  \n90 days. Plaintiffs therefore have a private right of action under 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b) to \n99  \nenforce the NVRA. Exhibit A contains the original notice provided to Secretary Hobbs and \n1100  \nall correspondence between the parties thereafter. \n1111  \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant \n1122  \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1357. \n1133  \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Secretary of State, as she is sued in her \n1144  \nofficial capacity as an elected official in Arizona. Further, the Secretary works and resides \n1155   in the State of Arizona.  \n1166   12.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Attorney General, as he is sued in his \n1177   official capacity as an elected official in Arizona. Further, the Attorney General works and \n1188   resides in the State of Arizona. \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction over the County Recorder Defendants, as they are \n1199  \nsued in their official capacities as elected officials in Arizona, and they work or reside in \n2200  \nthe State of Arizona. \n2211  \n14.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \n2222  \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district and in this \n2233  \ndivision. \n2244  \n15.  This  Court  has  the  authority  to  grant  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief \n2255  \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b). Further, this Court has \n2266  \nthe authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide preliminary and permanent \n2277  \ninjunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n2288  \n  \n-5- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 8 of 29\n \n11   PARTIES \n22   16.  Plaintiff Mi Familia Vota (“MFV”) is a national, non-profit civic engagement \n33   organization with a mission of uniting Latino, immigrant, and allied communities to \n44   promote social and economic justice through increased civic participation by encouraging \nleadership development, citizenship, and issue organizing. MFV encourages non-partisan \n55  \nvoter registration and voter participation and has challenged voter suppression around the \n66  \nnation. See, e.g., Mi Familia Vota v. Hobbs, No: 2:21-cv-01423-DWL (D. Ariz. filed Aug. \n77  \n17, 2021); Mi Familia Vota v. Abbott, 497 F. Supp. 3d 195 (W.D. Tex. 2020). It has \n88  \noperations in six states, including Arizona, where it is headquartered. More than 14,000 \n99  \nArizonans follow and engage with MFV via email and/or MFV’s social media platforms. \n1100  \n17.  In advance of the 2020 election, MFV organized voter registration drives and \n1111  \nconducted get-out-the-vote activities. MFV helped countless Arizonans register to vote \n1122  \nusing a Federal Form and helped countless Arizonans register to vote by mail. MFV also \n1133  \nconducted  voter  education  campaigns  and  provided  other  voter  assistance,  including \n1144  \ndriving voters to polling locations.  \n1155   18.  MFV plans to organize the same activities for future elections. As a result of \n1166   the Proof of Citizenship Restriction, however, MFV must divert money, personnel, time, \n1177   and resources away from other programming in order to dedicate more resources toward \n1188   efforts  to  ensure  that  voters  can  navigate  the  restrictions  imposed  by  the  Proof  of \nCitizenship Restriction. Additionally, MFV plans to hire additional staff to help educate \n1199  \nvoters about the Proof of Citizenship Restriction and is considering developing public \n2200  \nservice announcements in Spanish-language media concerning the changes. MFV will also \n2211  \nexpend resources confirming that voters who previously registered to vote either (1) pre-\n2222  \n2005 or (2) post-2005 using the Federal Form, are not prohibited from voting early by mail \n2233  \nor in presidential elections due to the Proof of Citizenship Restriction.   \n2244  \n19.  Plaintiff Voto Latino is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, social welfare organization that \n2255  \nengages, educates, and empowers Latinx communities across the United States, working \n2266  \nto ensure that Latinx voters are enfranchised and included in the democratic process. In \n2277  \nfurtherance of its mission, Voto Latino expends significant resources to register and \n2288  \nmobilize thousands of Latinx voters each election cycle, including the nearly 1.2 million \n  \n-6- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 9 of 29\n \n11   eligible Latinx voters in Arizona.5 Voto Latino considers eligible Latinx voters in Arizona \n22   to be the core of its constituency.  \n33   20.  Voto Latino mobilizes Latinx voters in Arizona through statewide voter \n44   registration initiatives, as well as peer-to-peer and digital voter education and get-out-the-\nvote campaigns. From 2017 to 2020, Voto Latino registered over 50,000 new voters in \n55  \nArizona. Of those registered voters, countless individuals registered using the Federal Form \n66  \nand registered to vote by mail.  \n77  \n21.  For future elections, Voto Latino anticipates making expenditures in the \n88  \nmillions of dollars to educate, register, mobilize, and turn out Latinx voters across the \n99  \nUnited States, including in Arizona. Voto Latino, however, must divert money, personnel, \n1100  \ntime, and resources away from its other registration initiatives toward efforts to ensure that \n1111  \nLatinx voters in Arizona can navigate the restrictions imposed by the Proof of Citizenship \n1122  \nRestriction. This will include expending staff time and money seeking to acquire data on \n1133  \nindividuals who will lose their right to vote by mail and vote in presidential elections due \n1144  \nto the Proof of Citizenship Restriction and working to ensure that voters who can no longer \n1155   vote by mail due to the Proof of Citizenship Restriction are aware of this limitation and are \n1166   still able to exercise the franchise.   \n1177   22.  Defendant Katie Hobbs is the Secretary of State of Arizona and is the Chief \n1188   Elections Officer for Arizona. Ariz. Const. art. V, § 9; A.R.S. § 16-142. The Secretary of \nState is “responsible for coordination of state responsibilities under the national voter \n1199  \nregistration act of 1993.” A.R.S. § 16-142(A)(1). Further, as Arizona’s Chief Elections \n2200  \nOfficer,  the  Secretary  is  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  state’s  election  laws  and \n2211  \noverseeing the voting process—and is empowered with broad authority to carry out that \n2222  \nresponsibility. As such, the Secretary has the authority to promulgate rules and procedures \n2233  \nfor elections, including rules and regulations pertaining to voter registration. A.R.S. §§ 16-\n2244  \n \n2255  \n5 According to the most recent data from the Pew Research Center’s analysis of 2018 \n2266   American Community Survey data (IPUMS) and Census Data 2018 ACS 1-year estimates \n(tables B05003 and B05003I), the number of Latinos eligible to vote in Arizona in 2018 \n2277  \nwas approximately 1,188,000.

The Secretary is sued in her official capacity for \n33   actions taken under color of state law. \n44   23.  Defendant Mark Brnovich is the Attorney General of Arizona and the State’s \nchief legal officer. Id. § 41-192. The Attorney General is authorized to enforce Arizona’s \n55  \nelection laws in “any election for state office, members of the legislature, justices of the \n66  \nsupreme court, judges of the court of appeals or statewide initiative or referendum . . . \n77  \nthrough civil and criminal actions.” Id. § 16-1021.

The \n99  \nAttorney General is sued in his official capacity for actions taken under color of state law.   \n1100  \n24.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction makes county recorders responsible for \n1111  \nimplementing  and  enforcing  the  statutory  provisions  at  issue  here.  Amongst  other \n1122  \nresponsibilities, county recorders are charged with verifying a voter’s citizenship status, \n1133  \nrejecting  voter  registration  applications  if  the  county  recorder  cannot  confirm  an \n1144  \napplicant’s  citizenship  status,  forwarding  applications  to  the  Attorney  General  for \n1155   investigation, and canceling a voter’s registration based on citizenship.

Pouquette is the Yuma County Recorder. \n44   STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA. Arizona has a long and tortured history of changing voter registration \n55  \nsystems. \n66  \n40.  Despite the lack of any credible fraud allegations, there has been a decades-\n77  \nlong effort in Arizona—as the state’s electorate has become more diverse—to restrict the \n88  \nfranchise and impose unjustifiable impediments to the right to vote. These changes have \n99  \nled to disenfranchisement, multiple conflicting systems, and repeated litigation.  \n1100  \n41.  As is particularly relevant here, in 2004 Arizona voters adopted Proposition \n1111  \n200, a ballot initiative purportedly designed “to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to \n1122  \npresent proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to present identification when \n1133   they vote on election day.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 2 (2006) (per curiam). \n1144   Proposition 200 amended the state’s election code to require county recorders to “reject \n1155   any application for registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United \n1166   States citizenship.” A.R.S. § 16–166(F). This requirement was seemingly in direct conflict \nwith the NVRA, which requires states to “accept and use” a standard federal registration \n1177  \nform for voter registration (the “Federal Form”) that does not require applicants to provide \n1188  \ndocumentary proof of citizenship. 52 U.S.C. § 20505. And, in fact, the Supreme Court held \n1199  \nin 2013 that the NVRA precluded Arizona from requiring applicants who used the NVRA’s \n2200  \nFederal Form to submit information beyond that required by the form itself. Inter Tribal \n2211  \nCouncil of Ariz., 570 U.S. at 15 (“We conclude that . . . a state-imposed requirement of \n2222  \nevidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is ‘inconsistent with’ the NVRA’s \n2233  \nmandate that States ‘accept and use’ the Federal Form.” (quoting Ex parte Siebold, 100 \n2244  \nU.S. 371, 397 (1880))).   \n2255  \n42.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Inter Tribal Council left open the \n2266  \npossibility of imposing different requirements for voters in state and local elections than \n2277   federal elections. Then-Attorney General Thomas Horne issued an Opinion on October 7, \n2288   2013 stating that such a system was required to comply with both state law and the NVRA, \n  \n-9- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 12 of 29\n \n11   see  Ariz.  Att’y  Gen.  Op.  No.  I13-011  (Oct.  7,  2013),  available  at \n22   https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2018-06/I13-011.pdf (last visited Mar. 30, 2022), \n33   and then-Secretary of State Ken Bennett subsequently implemented Arizona’s bifurcated \n44   voter registration system, which has been in place ever since.  \n43.  Under this bifurcated system, Arizona has three classes of voters: (1) those \n55  \nwho registered pre-2005 and did not have to show proof of citizenship, who have been \n66  \npermitted to vote in all elections; (2) those who registered post-2005 using the Federal \n77  \nForm and did not show evidence of citizenship, who have been permitted to vote only in \n88  \nfederal elections; and (3) those who registered post-2005 and showed adequate proof of \n99  \ncitizenship,  who  have  been  permitted  to  vote  in  all  elections.  Prior  to  the  Proof  of \n1100  \nCitizenship Restriction, all of these voters were entitled to vote in elections for which they \n1111  \nwere qualified by mail, a right which Arizona has provided to all voters for any reason \n1122  \nsince 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. \n1133  \n44.  This bifurcated system has already led to disenfranchisement and confusion, \n1144  \nresulting in further litigation. For example, prior to 2018, voters who used Arizona’s state \n1155   registration form and provided no evidence of citizenship were not registered to vote in \n1166   any elections, while voters who undertook the same process but used the Federal Form to \n1177   register were registered to vote in federal elections. See generally Consent Decree. What’s \n1188   more, because Arizona has documentary proof of citizenship for some citizens from their \ndriver’s license application, some citizens who register to vote with the Federal Form have \n1199  \nalready provided proof of citizenship in a means that is easily verifiable, and the state can \n2200  \neasily search for such voters’ documentation and allow them to vote in all elections. Id. \n2211  \n45.  Due to these issues, in 2017, the League of United Latin American Citizens \n2222  \nArizona and the Arizona Students’ Association sued then-Secretary of State Michele \n2233  \nReagan and then-Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, alleging that the state’s dual \n2244  \nvoter registration policies constituted an undue burden on the right to vote and that the \n2255  \nstate’s failure to register voters who used the state form without providing proof of \n2266  \ncitizenship in federal elections had disenfranchised “at least 26,000 otherwise eligible \n2277  \nvoters . . . in Maricopa County alone[.]” Compl. ¶¶ 39, 77-88, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-\n2288  \ncv-04102-DGC (Nov. 7, 2017), ECF No. 1. The parties entered into a consent decree to \n  \n-10- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 13 of 29\n \n11   end the litigation, which required (1) Arizona to treat all registrants the same regardless of \n22   whether they use the state form or Federal Form, registering all voters for federal elections; \n33   and (2) state and county officials to check the motor vehicles database for citizenship \n44   documentation before limiting voters to federal-only elections. See Consent Decree at 7-\n16. \n55  \n46.  As it presently stands, hundreds of thousands of Arizonans are registered to \n66  \nvote without having provided documentary proof of citizenship to the state. This includes \n77  \n31,000 voters in Arizona who are registered using only the Federal Form.6 Additionally, \n88  \nArizona did not require proof of citizenship to obtain a driver’s license until 1996, and the \n99  \nArizona Department of Transportation’s Motor Vehicle Division has reported that at least \n1100  \n192,000 Arizonans who have one of those pre-1996 licenses have not re-registered or \n1111  \nprovided proof of citizenship.7 Accordingly, there are at least 192,000 voters who are \n1122  \nseemingly entitled to vote in all elections in Arizona despite never providing proof of \n1133  \ncitizenship. \n1144  \nB. Arizona voters rely on the state’s early voting system. \n1155  \n47.  Early mail voting is immensely popular in Arizona, and for years, the vast \n1166  \nmajority of voters have relied on it to cast their ballot. Since 1991, all eligible voters in \n1177  \nArizona have been able to vote early by mail without a reason or “excuse” for doing so. \n1188   See A.R.S. § 16-541. Reliance on early mail voting has steadily grown ever since. In 2008, \n1199   over one million Arizonans, or around half of the voters who participated in the election, \n2200   used early mail voting. In 2016, over two million voters, or about 75 percent of voters who \n2211   participated in the election, used early mail voting. And in 2020, nearly three million \nvoters, or about 88 percent of those voters who participated in the election, used early mail \n2222  \nvoting. \n2233  \n48.  The ever-increasing reliance on early voting by mail in Arizona has led to an \n2244  \n2255  \n \n2266   6 See Howard Fischer, Some Arizona voters could face citizenship check, Ariz. Daily Star \n(Mar.  27,  2022),  https://tucson.com/news/local/subscriber/some-arizona-voters-could-\n2277  \nface-citizenship-check/article_72ec0350-ac76-11ec-a0d7-\n2fbe0dcb9094.html?utm_source=ourcommunitynow&utm_medium=web. \n2288  \n7 Id. \n  \n-11- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 14 of 29\n \n11   election-administration system heavily oriented toward mail voting, with a corresponding \n22   decrease in the availability of in-person voting options. In fact, one study found that the \n33   state has had the “most widespread reduction” in polling places of any state over the last \n44   decade—the state now has 320 fewer polling places than it did in 2012.8 While Arizona’s \ninducement of voters to use early voting by mail has helped to make voting generally more \n55  \naccessible in the state and has helped counties preserve resources, fewer polling places \n66  \ntranslates to more difficulties for those who must vote in person. This is especially true in \n77  \nrural places and on the state’s tribal lands, where voters must travel long distances to vote \n88  \nin person and where public transportation is often not available.  \n99  \nC. The 2020 election in Arizona was secure and accurate. \n1100  \n49.  Despite the significant challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, \n1111  \nArizona voters turned out in record-setting numbers in 2020. More than 3.4 million of the \n1122  \nstate’s 4.3 million voters, or 79.9 percent, cast a ballot. This compares to 74 percent in \n1133  \n2016, 74.2 percent in 2012, 74.3 percent in 2008, 77.7 percent in 2004, and 71.8 percent in \n1144  \n2000.9 \n1155  \n50.  The security and accuracy of the 2020 election results have been confirmed \n1166  \nand re-confirmed by county and state election officials, as well as the courts.  \n1177  \n51.  County election officials have confirmed and scrutinized the results. For \n1188   example, after the election, pursuant to A.R.S. § 16-602, ten of the state’s fifteen counties \n1199   performed a hand count of sample ballots to test the equipment, each confirming the \n2200   election’s initial results.  \n2211   52.  In Arizona’s largest county, Clint Hickman, the chair of the Maricopa County \nBoard of Supervisors, confirmed that “there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct or \n2222  \n2233  \n2244  \n \n2255  \n8 See The Leadership Conference Education Fund, Democracy Diverted: Polling Place \n2266   Closures  and  the  Right  to  Vote  17  (Sept.  2019), \nhttp://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/reports/Democracy-Diverted.pdf.   \n2277  \n9  Voter  Registration  and  Historical  Election  Data,  Ariz.

In  February  2021,  the  Maricopa  County  Elections  Department  further \n33   confirmed its results, hiring two auditing firms to conduct audits of the county’s tabulation \n44   system and equipment, which found no evidence of inaccuracies or improprieties.11 \n54.  State officials have likewise confirmed the results of the 2020 election and \n55  \nhave publicly and definitively declared their accuracy. Arizona law requires the Secretary, \n66  \nin the Governor’s presence, to certify the statewide canvass. See A.R.S. § 16-648. On \n77  \nNovember 30, 2020, Secretary Hobbs, in the presence of Governor Ducey, did so. The \n88  \nGovernor himself further confirmed and defended the accuracy of the results through his \n99  \nsocial media accounts and in a meeting at the White House with former President Trump. \n1100  \n55.  Additionally, multiple lawsuits seeking to overturn the results of the election \n1111  \nonly served to further confirm that the election was secure.  \n1122  \n56.  For example, in Bowyer v. Ducey, various Republican officials filed a lawsuit \n1133  \nseeking  decertification  of  the  election  based  on,  among  other  things,  allegations  of \n1144  \nimproprieties in signature matching. The court dismissed the suit on multiple grounds, \n1155   including a lack of any evidence. 506 F. Supp. 3d 699, 722 (D. Ariz. Dec. 9, 2020).  \n1166   57.  Similarly, in Ward v. Jackson, the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that \n1177   the Republican challenger failed to “establish any degree of fraud or a sufficient error rate \n1188   that would undermine the certainty of the election results[.]” No. CV-20-0343-AP/EL, \n2020 WL 8617817, at *2 (Ariz.

Nevertheless,  fact-free  conspiracy  theories  and  efforts  to  undermine \n2211  \nconfidence in the elections process have continued to percolate. In particular, these same \n2222  \nbaseless and repeatedly disproven “concerns” have continued to animate claims of fraud \n2233  \n2244  \n \n10 Letter  from  Clint  Hickman  to  Maricopa  County  Voters,  Maricopa  Cnty.

H.B. 2492 is merely the latest in a string of baseless allegations of fraud that \nhave led to a host of pernicious efforts in Arizona to target early voting by \n33  \nmail. \n44  \n59.  When the 2021 legislative session began, Republicans in the Legislature \n55  \nmoved quickly to introduce several bills to severely restrict access to the franchise in \n66  \nArizona, relying on continuing evidence-free allegations of fraud in Arizona elections. This \n77  \nresulted in the passage of two bills in the 2021 legislative session that restrict the franchise: \n88   (1) S.B. 1003, which prohibits voters whose early voting by mail ballots are flagged for \n99   rejection based on a missing signature from curing that deficiency after 7 p.m. on Election \n1100   Day;  and  (2)  S.B.  1485,  which  fundamentally  alters  the  state’s  immensely  popular \n1111   Permanent Early Voting List—which the new legislation rebrands as the Active Early \nVoting List—by requiring election officials to purge from the list any voter who has not \n1122  \nvoted an early ballot “for two consecutive election cycles.” Both bills are aimed squarely \n1133  \nat suppressing voter participation using Arizona’s early voting regime. \n1144  \n60.  Legislation is not the only means of this ongoing assault on early voting by \n1155  \nmail. The Arizona Republican Party recently initiated litigation in the Arizona Supreme \n1166  \nCourt seeking an order declaring that all no-excuse early voting by mail in Arizona, as well \n1177  \nas the use of drop boxes to return ballots, violate the Arizona Constitution. See Compl., \n1188  \nAriz. Republican Party v. Hobbs, No. CV-22-0048-SA (Ariz. Feb. 25, 2022). After the \n1199  \nArizona Supreme Court declined to take jurisdiction, the Arizona Republican Party filed a \n2200  \nsimilar lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the Mohave County, \n2211  \nArizona Republican Party, et al. v. Hobbs et al., No. CV-2022-00594 (Ariz. Super. Ct. \n2222  \nJune 28, 2022). \n2233   61.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction continues this anti-voter trend, marrying \n2244   it to Arizona’s nearly twenty-year effort to introduce roadblocks into its voter registration \n2255   regime. The result is a law which has a host of problematic provisions, including: \n2266     requiring that as a qualification of registration an individual “ha[ve] \nprovided satisfactory evidence of citizenship” and revising the definition \n2277  \nof a “qualified elector” in Arizona to include that such person must have \n2288  \n  \n-14- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 17 of 29\n \n11   “provided satisfactory evidence of citizenship.” (Sections 1, 2);12 \n22     prohibiting  any  registered  voter  (other  than  voters  protected  by  the \n33   Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) who has not \n44   provided adequate proof of citizenship—including potentially all voters \nregistered  before  2005  and  all  federal-only  voters—from  voting  in \n55  \npresidential elections until they provide adequate proof of citizenship, \n66  \nwith no provisions for how such voters should or will receive notice of \n77  \nany such prohibition (Section 5); \n88  \n  prohibiting all voters in Arizona who can currently vote only in federal \n99  \nelections from voting early by mail in any elections (Section 5);  \n1100  \n  prohibiting Arizonans who seek to register without adequate proof of \n1111  \ncitizenship from registering to vote in presidential elections or from \n1122  \nvoting early by mail (Section 4); \n1133  \n  requiring county recorders to reject the application of any voter who \n1144  \nsubmits a state registration form without proof of citizenship (Section 4); \n1155  \n  requiring county recorders to research the citizenship of any voter who \n1166  \nsubmits a Federal Form, prohibit any such voter from voting in any \n1177  \nelection if the county recorder cannot determine they are a United States \n1188   citizen, and refer any such voter’s registration to the county attorney and \n1199   Attorney General for investigation if the county recorder determines they \n2200   are not a United States citizen (Section 4); \n2211     requiring the Secretary of State and county recorders to provide a list to \nthe  Attorney  General  of  any  voters  who  are  registered  without \n2222  \nsatisfactory proof of citizenship, and requiring the Attorney General to \n2233  \ninvestigate the citizenship of these individuals and report to the Secretary \n2244  \nof State, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House \n2255  \n2266    \n12 Arizona does not permit an individual to vote “unless such person’s name appears as a \n2277  \nqualified elector in both the general county register and in the precinct register or list of the \nprecinct and election districts or proposed election districts in which such person resides[.]” \n2288  \nA.R.S. § 16-122. \n  \n-15- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 18 of 29\n \n11   regarding the results of his investigation (Section 7); and \n22     requiring  the  Attorney  General  to  prosecute  any  individuals  his \n33   investigation uncovers who are not United States citizens (Section 7). \n44   E. The burdens imposed by the Proof of Citizenship Restriction on the right to \nvote are substantial. \n55  \n62.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction burdens Arizona voters’ ability to vote \n66  \nby mail and in presidential elections in at least four different ways.  \n77  \n63.  First, registered voters who properly registered to vote without providing \n88  \nproof of citizenship—either due to state requirements at the time they registered or because \n99  \nthey submitted the Federal Form—may be prohibited from voting in presidential elections \n1100  \nwithout any notice or opportunity to challenge the State’s determination. H.B. 2492 § 5, \n1111  \n55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022). This includes nearly 200,000 Arizonans who \n1122  \nregistered to vote before October 1, 1996,13 and 31,000 Arizonans who registered using the \n1133   Federal Form.14  \n1144   64.  Furthermore,  those  31,000  Arizonans  who  registered  to  vote  using  the \n1155   Federal Form would be prohibited from voting early by mail, again without any notice or \n1166   opportunity to challenge the State’s determination. H.B. 2492 § 5, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. \n(Ariz. 2022). As discussed above, Arizona has allowed voters to vote by mail for any reason \n1177  \nsince 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. To now suddenly strip these registered voters of their \n1188  \nability to vote by mail without any notice substantially burdens their fundamental right to \n1199  \nvote. \n2200  \n65.  It bears repeating that despite depriving these voters of their right to vote in \n2211  \npresidential  elections  or  early  by  mail,  the  statute  does  not  include  any  procedural \n2222  \nsafeguards. There is no notice requirement. There is no opportunity for the voter to provide \n2233  \ndocumentary proof of citizenship. The statute does not even outline a time frame during \n2244  \nwhich this removal of rights should occur. This lack of process will result in registered \n2255  \n \n2266   13 See Laurie Roberts, Republicans want HOW MANY Arizonans to prove they have a right \nto  vote?,  Ariz.  Republic  (March  28,  2022,  9:12  AM), \n2277  \nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/03/28/arizona-voters-\nmay-soon-prove-right-vote-citizenship/7192260001/. \n2288  \n14 See Fischer, supra n.6.  \n  \n-16- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 19 of 29\n \n11   voters being left in the dark about whether and how they can vote. \n22   66.  Second, the State has once again added another wrinkle to what was already \n33   a confusing, bifurcated voter registration system that frustrates Arizonans’ right to vote. \n44   This system has already resulted in allegations of disenfranchisement resulting in an \nongoing consent decree, whose requirements seem potentially in conflict with the Proof of \n55  \nCitizenship Restriction. See Compl. ¶¶ 39, 77-88, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-cv-04102-\n66  \nDGC (Nov. 7, 2017), ECF No. 1; Consent Decree at 7-16. The law will likely undo any \n77  \nharm the consent decree has averted, again resulting in the disenfranchisement of eligible \n88  \nvoters who cannot navigate Arizona’s needlessly confusing, byzantine, and ever-changing \n99  \nvoter registration system. \n1100  \n67.  Third, the law will require hundreds of thousands of voters who never had to \n1111  \nprovide further documentation to do so if they wish to continue to vote in presidential \n1122  \nelections or, for Federal Form voters, to continue voting early by mail for any election. For \n1133  \nmany voters who lack such documentation, the costs in time and effort to obtain it are \n1144  \nsubstantial, erecting a barrier so substantial that it disenfranchises these voters. Other courts \n1155   considering challenges to similar laws have found these types of burdens to constitute a \n1166   substantial burden on the right to vote. See, e.g., Fish v. Schwab, 957 F.3d 1105, 1131 (10th \n1177   Cir. 2020) (explaining that “extensive testimony about individual voters like Mr. Fish and \n1188   Ms.  Bucci  who  lacked  [proof of  citizenship]  or  faced  significant  costs  to  obtain  it” \npermitted  “the  district  court  [to]  properly  conclude  here  that  the  [citizenship \n1199  \ndocumentation] requirement imposed a significant burden on the right to vote”), cert. \n2200  \ndenied, 141 S. Ct. 965 (2020); League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 13 \n2211  \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (“It does not matter whether that is because they lack access to the \n2222  \nrequisite documentary proof or simply because the process of obtaining that proof is so \n2233  \nonerous that they give up. The outcome is the same—the abridgment of the right to vote.” \n2244  \n(citation omitted)). \n2255  \n68.  Fourth, the law subjects potential voters to investigation by the Attorney \n2266  \nGeneral based solely on a county recorder’s inability to locate them in certain enumerated \n2277  \ndatabases. Such inability could result from something as simple as a typographical or \n2288  \ntranscription error, and fear of wrongful investigation may chill otherwise eligible voters \n  \n-17- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 20 of 29\n \n11   from seeking to register to vote or exercising the franchise.  \n22   69.  Taken together, this host of harms constitutes a substantial burden on the \n33   right to vote. \n44   F.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction serves no justifiable state interest. \n55   70.  As with so many pernicious voting restrictions, proponents of the Proof of \n66   Citizenship Restriction justify it by invoking the boogeyman of voter fraud without any \nproof to support their claims.  \n77  \n71.  During the Legislature’s consideration of the Bill, no legislator identified a \n88  \nsingle instance of voter fraud or impropriety in Arizona related to mail-in early voting \n99  \nballots that would precipitate the need for the changes at issue.  \n1100  \n72.  Instead, evidence-free assertions were offered such as that by Bill Sponsor \n1111  \nRep. Jake Hoffman, who stated that the Bill was needed because Arizona “cannot allow \n1122  \npotentially tens of thousands of noncitizens to vote in our elections.”15 This unsupported \n1133  \nfearmongering  is  plainly  insufficient  to  justify  the  Proof  of  Citizenship Restriction’s \n1144  \nwidespread burdens. \n1155  \n73.  Meanwhile,  the  Legislature’s  own  lawyers  advised  that  the  Proof  of \n1166  \nCitizenship Restriction violates federal law and invites litigation.16 Indeed, Speaker Pro \n1177  \nTempore of the Arizona House Travis Grantham acknowledged that a motivation behind \n1188   the law is to broadly challenge the constitutionality of the NVRA, stating that the law was \n1199   important to “fight for local control of our elections” and that challenging related federal \n2200   rulings was “a fight worth having.”17 But disagreement with and open defiance of federal \n2211  \n \n2222  \n15 See Katya Schwenk, ‘Extreme’ Arizona Elections Bill Inching Closer to Law, Phoenix \nNew Times (Mar. 30, 2022, 6:00 AM), https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/extreme-\n2233  \narizona-elections-bills-inching-closer-to-law-13323436. \n2244   16 See Trevor Potter, This Arizona bill could keep you from voting early, by mail or for \npresident,  AZ  Central  (Mar.  27,  2022,  6:00  AM), \n2255  \nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2022/03/27/arizona-bill-could-keep-you-\n2266   voting-early-president/7158739001/; Howard Fischer, GOP lawmakers seek to reopen \nlegal  voting  issue,  Daily  Independent  (Mar.  26,  2022,  9:00  AM), \n2277  \nhttps://www.yourvalley.net/stories/gop-lawmakers-seek-to-reopen-legal-voting-\nissue,293949. \n2288  \n17 See Fischer, supra n.16.  \n  \n-18- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 21 of 29\n \n11   law is also insufficient to justify the Proof of Citizenship Restriction’s significant burdens \n22   on Arizonans’ voting rights. \n33   74.  Other courts have rightfully found similar laws to be unconstitutional. For \n44   example, in 2011 Kansas adopted a law that required state and county election officials to \nreject voter registration applications unless the applicant submitted “satisfactory evidence \n55  \nof United States citizenship.” Fish, 957 F.3d at 1111 (quoting Secure and Fair Elections \n66  \n(“SAFE”) Act, ch. 56, § 8(l), 2011 Kan. Sess. Laws 795, 806, 809–11 (codified at Kan. \n77  \nStat. Ann. § 25–2309(l))). The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit \n88  \nultimately held that the Kansas law violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection \n99  \nClause because it was an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote and that it was also \n1100  \npreempted by Section 5 of the NVRA. Id. at 1121. The Court found particularly relevant \n1111  \nthe  fact  that  the  Kansas  law  impacted  31,089  applicants  who  were  prevented  from \n1122  \nregistering to vote distinguished this from other voting restrictions where the burden was \n1133  \nless clear. See id. at 1129.  \n1144  \n75.  As noted above, the Proof of Citizenship Restriction imposes significant new \n1155   restrictions and burdens on a minimum of approximately 200,000 Arizonans, an impact \n1166   over six times greater than that which gave the Tenth Circuit such pause in Fish. As in \n1177   Fish,  there  can  be  little  doubt  that  the  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  imposes  an \n1188   unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n1199  \nCOUNT I \n2200  \nUnjustifiable Burden on the Right to Vote  \n2211  \nU.S. Const.

The Proof of Citizenship Restriction imposes a disparate and unjustifiable \n66  \nburden on the right to vote. As detailed above, it strips voters of the right to vote in \n77  \npresidential elections or by mail without notice, adds further confusion to what was already \n88  \na convoluted registration process that has led to disenfranchisement, imposes substantial \n99  \nnew costs on hundreds of thousands of Arizonans to exercise the franchise, and exposes \n1100  \nvoters to the threat of baseless investigation by the Attorney General. Both individually \n1111  \nand in combination these harms impose a significant—and in many cases severe—burden \n1122  \non the right to vote. The Proof of Citizenship Restriction also harms Plaintiffs because it \n1133  \ndisproportionately impacts their members and constituents, and will require Plaintiffs to \n1144  \ndivert money, personnel, time, and resources away from other programming in order to \n1155   dedicate more resources toward efforts to ensure that voters can navigate the restrictions \n1166   imposed by the Proof of Citizenship Restriction.  \n1177   80.  These burdens are not justified by any sufficient state interest.  \n1188   COUNT II \nDenial of Procedural Due Process \n1199  \nU.S. Const. Amend.

To determine whether a plaintiff has been denied procedural due process in \n2244   violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a court first asks \n2255   whether a constitutionally protected liberty interest is at stake.

Because Arizona allows all \n55  \nregistered voters to exercise their fundamental right to vote early by mail, there is a \n66  \nconstitutionally protected liberty interest involved in the process of casting a ballot by mail \n77  \nand in having that ballot counted. See, e.g., Democracy N.C. v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, \n88  \n476  F.

Parks/Bellemont Absentee Election Bd., 762 F. Supp. 1354, 1358 (D. Ariz. \n1155   1990)); Zessar v. Helander, No. 05 C 1917, 2006 WL 642646, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 13, \n1166   2006) (“The right to vote by absentee ballot is not, in and of itself, a fundamental right. But \n1177   once the State permits voters to vote absentee, it must afford appropriate due process \n1188   protections, including notice and a hearing, before rejecting an absentee ballot.”). As a \nresult, Defendants may not deprive voters of the right to vote early by mail without \n1199  \nproviding adequate procedures. \n2200  \n84.  Arizona’s  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  will  deprive  hundreds  of \n2211  \nthousands of currently registered voters of their ability to vote by mail in future elections. \n2222  \nIt does so while giving no details about any notice these voters will be provided, or how or \n2233  \nwhen they may cure this defect. This imposes a severe burden on their procedural due \n2244  \nprocess rights. The Proof of Citizenship Restriction also harms Plaintiffs because it will \n2255  \ndeprive their members and constituents of the ability to vote by mail in future elections, \n2266  \nand will require Plaintiffs to divert money, personnel, time, and resources away from other \n2277  \nprogramming in order to dedicate more resources toward efforts to ensure that voters can \n2288  \nnavigate the restrictions imposed by the Proof of Citizenship Restriction.  \n  \n-21- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 24 of 29\n \n11   85.  As  detailed  above,  there  is  no  state  interest  which  justifies  stripping \n22   registered voters of the state-protected right to vote early by mail with no notice or \n33   opportunity to cure. \n44   COUNT III \nDisparate Treatment in Violation of the Right to Equal Protection \n55  \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n66   (As to all Defendants) \n \n77  \n86.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraph 1 through 75 as if \n88  \nfully set forth herein. \n99  \n87.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states \n1100   from “deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. \n1111   CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.  \n1122   88.  This constitutional provision requires “that all persons similarly situated \n1133   should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburn Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985); \nsee also Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104-05 (2000) (holding Equal Protection Clause applies \n1144  \nto “the manner of [the] exercise [of voting]” and “once granted the right to vote on equal \n1155  \nterms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s vote \n1166  \nover that of another”). Equal protection concerns regarding elections laws are properly \n1177  \nevaluated under the Anderson-Burdick framework. See, e.g., Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d \n1188  \n1098, 1106 n.15 (9th Cir. 2011). \n1199  \n89.  The  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  arbitrarily  treats  Arizona  voters \n2200  \ndifferently based solely on which voter registration form they happen to use. Those voters \n2211  \nregistering using the Federal Form without proof of citizenship will be entitled to vote in \n2222  \nfederal  congressional  elections,  while  the  same  voter  presenting  the  same  proof  of \n2233  \neligibility but using a state form will have their registration rejected entirely.  \n2244   90.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction also arbitrarily discriminates against \n2255   Federal Form voters. Under H.B. 2492, eligible and registered voters placed on the Federal \n2266   Only Voters List cannot utilize Arizona’s early voting opportunities and cannot vote in \n2277   presidential elections. Instead, they can exercise their right to vote only in-person on \nelection day and can only cast a ballot for congressional offices. Similarly situated eligible \n2288  \n  \n-22- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 25 of 29\n \n11   voters for federal elections are able to access Arizona’s early voting opportunities and vote \n22   for all federal offices.  \n33   91.  The  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  also  harms  Plaintiffs  because  it \n44   arbitrarily discriminates against its members and constituents, and will require Plaintiffs to \ndivert money, personnel, time, and resources away from other programming in order to \n55  \ndedicate more resources toward efforts to ensure that voters can navigate the restrictions \n66  \nimposed by the Proof of Citizenship Restriction.  \n77  \n92.  These burdens are not justified by any sufficient state interest.  \n88  \nCOUNT IV \n99  \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993 \n1100   52 U.S.C. §§ 20505, 20507, 20508, 20510 \n(As to Defendants Hobbs and the County Recorders) \n1111  \n \n1122   93.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 75 as if \n1133   fully set forth herein. \n94.  The NVRA requires Arizona to “accept and use the mail voter registration \n1144  \napplication  form  prescribed  by  the  [Election  Assistance  Commission]  . . .  for  the \n1155  \nregistration of voters in elections for Federal office” if the Federal Form or any other “valid \n1166  \nvoter registration form” is timely received. 52 U.S.C. §§ 20505(a)(1), 20507(a)(1)(A)-(D), \n1177  \n20508(a),  21132.  The  Federal  Form  “may  require  only  such  identifying  information \n1188  \n(including the signature of the applicant) and other information (including data relating to \n1199  \nprevious registration by the applicant), as is necessary to enable the appropriate State \n2200  \nelection official to assess the eligibility of the applicant” and must include a statement that \n2211  \n(1) specifies each eligibility requirement (including citizenship); (2) contains an attestation \n2222  \nthat the applicant meets each such requirement; and (3) requires the signature of the \n2233  \napplicant, under penalty of perjury. Id. § 20508. \n2244   95.  The  NVRA  also  requires  that  Arizona  “shall  ensure  that  an[]  eligible \n2255   applicant is registered to vote in a federal election” if the Federal Form or any other “valid \n2266   voter registration form” is timely received. Id. § 20507(a)(1)(A)-(D). \n2277   96.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction violates several sections of the NVRA. \nFirst, the NVRA provides that a state shall ensure that any eligible applicant is registered \n2288  \n  \n-23- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 26 of 29\n \n11   to vote in an election if they submit a valid voter registration form “not later than the lesser \n22   of 30 days, or the period provided by State law, before the date of the election.” Id. § 20507 \n33   (a)(1)(B). By not placing voters who complete a Federal Form on the list of qualified \n44   electors under A.R.S. § 16-122 within this timeframe, the Proof of Citizenship Restriction \nviolates the NVRA. \n55  \n97.  Second, by changing the definition of “qualified elector” such that voters \n66  \nwho complete a Federal Form would not appear on the list of qualified electors detailed by \n77  \nA.R.S. § 16-122 for presidential elections, Arizona has added an additional qualification \n88  \nto the Federal Form for presidential elections. “[A] state-imposed requirement of evidence \n99  \nof citizenship not required by the Federal Form is ‘inconsistent with’ the NVRA’s mandate \n1100  \nthat States ‘accept and use’ the Federal Form.” Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., 570 U.S. at \n1111  \n15 (citation omitted). H.B. 2492 provides that any voter who completes (or has completed) \n1122  \na Federal Form but does (or did) not provide proof of citizenship cannot appear on the list \n1133  \nof “qualified electors” for a presidential election under A.R.S. § 16-122. By failing to fully \n1144  \n“accept and use” the Federal Form, H.B. 2492 violates 52 U.S.C. § 20505(a)(1), 52 U.S.C. \n1155   § 20508(b), and 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1). \n1166   98.  Section  20510(b)  of  the  NVRA  provides  a  right  of  action  to  persons \n1177   aggrieved by violations of the NVRA to bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive \n1188   relief with respect to the violations if they provide the appropriate written notice and the \nviolation is not remedied. 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b). The Proof of Citizenship Restriction will \n1199  \nresult in Plaintiffs’ members and constituents being denied their statutory protections under \n2200  \nthe  NVRA  and,  as  detailed  above,  lead  to  their  disenfranchisement.  The  Proof  of \n2211  \nCitizenship Restriction will also require Plaintiffs to divert money, personnel, time, and \n2222  \nresources away from other programming in order to dedicate more resources toward efforts \n2233  \nto ensure that voters can navigate the restrictions imposed by the Proof of Citizenship \n2244  \nRestriction.  \n2255  \n99.  Plaintiffs provided the Secretary with written notice of these violations of the \n2266  \nNVRA on April 7, 2022. Ex. A; see id. § 20510(b)(1). Because the Secretary failed to \n2277  \nremedy the violation within 90 days after receipt of Plaintiffs’ notice, Plaintiffs bring this \n2288  \naction. See id. § 20510(b)(2). \n  \n-24- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 27 of 29\n \n11   COUNT V \n22   Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B) \n33  \n(As to all Defendants) \n44    \n100.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 75 as if \n55  \nfully set forth herein. \n66  \n101.  The  Materiality  Provision  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  prohibits \n77  \nindividuals “acting under color of law” from denying anyone the right “to vote in any \n88  \nelection because of an error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application, \n99  \nregistration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not material in \n1100   determining whether such individual is qualified under State law to vote in such election.” \n1111   52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B). Under Arizona law, individuals who meet the following \n1122   qualifications are eligible to vote under State law: 1) United States citizen; 2) Arizona \n1133   resident and resident of their registered county for 29 days before an election; 3) 18 or older \nbefore the next general election; 4) able to write their name and make a mark on a ballot, \n1144  \nunless prevented to by a physical disability; 5) not legally incapacitated; and 6) not \n1155  \nconvicted of a treason or felony, unless restored to civil rights. See Ariz. Const. art VII, § \n1166  \n2, cl. A; A.R.S. § 16-101. \n1177  \n102.  H.B. 2492 violates the Materiality Provision in several ways. First, it bars \n1188  \nelection  officials  from  registering  new  voters  who  have  already  provided  proof  of \n1199  \ncitizenship if they fail to check a box on the State or Federal Form indicating that they are \n2200  \ncitizens. Whether a prospective voter, through error or omission, fails to check a box on a \n2211  \nvoter registration form is not material to Arizona determining whether they are qualified to \n2222  \nvote under State law. See Ariz. Const. art VII, § 2, cl. A; A.R.S. § 16-101. \n2233  \n103.  Second, H.B. 2492 bars election officials from registering new voters if their \n2244   State Form registration application does not include their birthplace. Whether a prospective \n2255   voter, through error or omission, fails to list their birthplace is not material to Arizona \n2266   determining whether they are qualified to vote under State law.  See Ariz. Const. art VII, § \n2277   2, cl. A; A.R.S. § 16-101.  \n104.  Third, H.B. 2492 bars election officials from allowing prospective voters \n2288  \n  \n-25- \nPLAINTIFFS’ SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 65   Filed 07/18/22   Page 28 of 29\n \n11   who are registering using the Federal Form to vote in presidential elections or early by mail \n22   in any election unless they submit proof of citizenship. Whether a prospective voter who \n33   has complied with the Federal Form’s citizenship attestation requirement submits proof of \n44   citizenship is not material to Arizona determining whether they are qualified to vote under \nState law in presidential elections or early by mail in any election.  See Ariz. Const. art VII, \n55  \n§ 2, cl. A; A.R.S. § 16-101. \n66  \n105.  Fourth, H.B. 2492 bars election officials from allowing already registered \n77  \nvoters who registered using the Federal Form to vote in presidential elections or early by \n88  \nmail in any election unless they submit proof of citizenship. Whether a current voter who \n99  \nsuccessfully registered to vote using the Federal Form submits proof of citizenship is not \n1100  \nmaterial to Arizona determining whether they are qualified to vote under State law in \n1111  \npresidential elections or early by mail in any election.  See Ariz. Const. art VII, § 2, cl. A; \n1122  \nA.R.S. § 16-101.  \n1133  \n106.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction will result in Plaintiffs’ members and \n1144  \nconstituents being denied their statutory protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n1155   and,  as  detailed  above,  lead  to  their  disenfranchisement.  The  Proof  of  Citizenship \n1166   Restriction will also require Plaintiffs to divert money, personnel, time, and resources away \n1177   from other programming in order to dedicate more resources toward efforts to ensure that \n1188   voters can navigate the restrictions imposed by the Proof of Citizenship Restriction.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n1199  \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter the following judgment: \n2200  \nA. Declare that the Proof of Citizenship Restriction (H.B. 2492) violates the First \n2211  \nand Fourteenth Amendments, the NVRA, and the Materiality Provision of the \n2222  \nCivil Rights Act of 1964; \n2233  \nB. Enjoin Defendants, along with their respective agents, officers, employees, and \n2244  \nsuccessors from enforcing the Proof of Citizenship Restriction; \n2255  \nC.

BACKGROUND \n22  The facts of this case were summarized in the Court’s prior Order regarding the \n23  State’s  Motion  to  Dismiss.  (See  generally  Doc.  304,  02/16/2023  Order.)  This  case \n24  addresses  the  legality  of  two  Arizona  laws,  H.B.  2243  and  H.B.  2492  (“the  Voting \n25  Laws”), which amended provisions regulating voter registration under Title 16 of the \n26  Arizona Revised Statutes. (Doc. 388, Non-US SOF ¶¶ 4–5.) The Voting Laws, effective \n27  January 1, 2023, enable State officials to require heightened proof of citizenship and \n28  residency from Arizona applicants and registrants and mandate certain consequences if a \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 2 of 35\n \n \n \n1  registrant does not provide such proof. (Id. ¶¶ 2–5, 31, 35–50.) The Voting Laws also \n2  provide for monthly comparisons of certain registered voters to several databases and \n3  cancellation of registrations after those database comparisons. (Id. ¶¶ 3–4, 48–50.)  \n4  A.  Substance of the Voting Laws  \n5  An individual seeking to register to vote in Arizona state elections must provide \n6  one of the following  forms of “satisfactory  evidence of citizenship,” also known as \n7  documentary proof of citizenship or “DPOC”:  \n1.  The  number  of  the  applicant’s  driver  license  or  nonoperating \n8 \nidentification license issued after October 1, 1996 by the department of \ntransportation  or  the  equivalent  governmental  agency  of  another  state \n9 \nwithin the United States if the agency indicates on the applicant’s driver \nlicense or nonoperating identification license that the person has provided \n10 \nsatisfactory proof of United States citizenship.  \n11   \n2.  A  legible  photocopy  of  the  applicant’s  birth  certificate  that  verifies \n12  citizenship to the satisfaction of the county recorder.  \n \n13  3. A legible photocopy of pertinent pages of the applicant’s United States \npassport identifying the applicant and the applicant’s passport number or \n14  presentation  to  the  county  recorder  of  the  applicant’s  United  States \npassport.  \n15   \n4. A presentation to the county recorder of the applicant’s United States \n16  naturalization documents or the number of the certificate of naturalization. \nIf  only  the  number  of  the  certificate  of  naturalization  is  provided,  the \n17  applicant shall not be included in the registration rolls until the number of \nthe  certificate  of  naturalization  is  verified  with  the  United  States \n18  immigration and naturalization service by the county recorder.  \n \n19  5. Other documents or methods of proof that are established pursuant to the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  \n20   \n6. The applicant’s Bureau of Indian affairs card number, tribal treaty card \n21  number or tribal enrollment number.  \n22  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-166(F). \n23     In addition to providing applicants a State Form to register for state and federal \n24  elections, Arizona also provides a form created by the United States Election Assistance \n25  Commission, known as the Federal Form, to register for federal elections. See Gonzales \n26  v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 394 (9th Cir. 2012); (see generally Doc. 365-1, Ex. C, Federal \n27  Form at 26; see Doc. 365-1, Ex. D, State Form.) Subject to certain limitations, states may \n28  require additional information from applicants seeking to vote in both state and federal \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 3 of 35\n \n \n \n1  elections. See Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 12–13 (2013).  \n2    In  2018,  the  Arizona  Secretary  of  State  entered  into  a  Consent  Decree  with \n3  Plaintiff League of United Latin American Citizens (“LULAC”) after the nonprofit sued \n4  Arizona for allegedly discriminating against individuals who submitted the State Form \n5  without  providing  DPOC.  (Non-US  SOF  ¶¶  24–25.)  The  LULAC  Consent  Decree \n6  mandates that Arizona may not entirely reject an otherwise valid State Form submitted \n7  without DPOC, but rather must register that State Form applicant for federal elections. \n8  (Id.; Doc. 388-4, Ex. 12, LULAC Consent Decree at 8–9.) In short, the LULAC Consent \n9  Decree requires Arizona to treat Federal and State Form users the same when registering \n10  applicants  for  federal  elections.  The  Federal  Form  and  State  Form  both  include  a \n11  checkbox for applicants to indicate under penalty of perjury that they are citizens of the \n12  United States. (See Federal Form; State Form.) \n13  1.  H.B. 2492  \n14  H.B. 2492 created additional requirements for individuals using either the Federal \n15  or State Form to show citizenship and Arizona residence. Specifically, “[a] person is \n16  presumed to be properly registered to vote,” only if she, inter alia, provides documentary \n17  “proof  of  location  of  residence”  (“DPOR”),  lists  her  place  of  birth1  (“Birthplace \n18  Requirement”), and marks “yes” in the checkbox confirming United States citizenship \n19  (“Checkbox Requirement”). A.R.S. § 16-121.01(A);  see id. § 16-123. Unlike preexisting \n20  Arizona law, H.B. 2492 contains no exceptions to the DPOR requirement for applicants \n21  who do not have numbered street addresses, but the Secretary of State has since provided \n22  a chart recognizing that certain voters may provide DPOR without a traditional street \n23  address or any address at all. (See Non-US SOF ¶¶ 27–34.) \n24  H.B. 2492 also provides different DPOC requirements for applicants using the \n25  Federal or State Form: \nExcept  for  a  form  produced  by  the  United  States  Election  Assistance \n26 \nCommission,  any  application  for  registration  shall  be  accompanied  by \nsatisfactory  evidence  of  citizenship  as  prescribed  in  Section  16-166, \n27 \n \n28  1  The  Federal  Form  does  not  include  a  space  to  collect  an  applicant’s  birthplace \ninformation. (See Federal Form at 26.) \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 4 of 35\n \n \n \n1  Subsection F, and the county recorder . . . shall reject any application for \nregistration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of citizenship.  \n2 \nA.R.S. § 16-121.01(C) \n3 \nFederal only voters; early ballot; eligibility \n4 \nNotwithstanding any other law: \n1.  A  person  who  has  registered  to  vote  and  who  has  not  provided \n5 \nsatisfactory evidence of citizenship as prescribed by Section 16-166, \nSubsection F is not eligible to vote in presidential elections.  \n6 \n2.  A  person  who  has  not  provided  satisfactory  evidence  of  citizenship \npursuant to Section 16-166, Subsection F and who is eligible to vote \n7 \nonly for federal offices is not eligible to receive an early ballot by mail.   \n8 \nId. § 16-127(A).  \n9 \nThe statute places the burden on county recorders to enforce the standards of H.B. \n10 \n2492. “Within ten days after receiving an application for registration [through the Federal \n11 \nForm] that is not accompanied by [DPOC], the county recorder or other officer in charge \n12 \nof  elections  shall  use  all  available  resources  to  verify  the  citizenship  status  of  the \n13 \napplicant.” Id. § 16-121.01(D). The statute prescribes a specific verification process:  \n14 \n[A]t  a  minimum,  [the  election  official]  shall  compare  the  information \n15  available on the application for registration with the following, provided the \ncounty has access: \n16  1.  The Department of Transportation databases of Arizona driver licenses \nor nonoperating identification licenses. \n17   \n2.  The Social Security Administration databases. \n18   \n3.  The  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  Systematic \n19  Alien Verification for Entitlements program, if practicable. \n \n20  4.  A  National  Association  for  Public  Health  statistics  and  information \nsystems electronic verification of vital events system. \n21   \n5.  Any other state, city, town, county or federal database and any other \n22  database relating to voter registration to which the County Recorder . . . \nhas  access,  including  an  electronic  registration  information  center \n23  database.  \n24  Id. \n25  The statute provides for three different outcomes from this verification. First, if the \n26  election official “matches the applicant with information that verifies the applicant is a \n27  United States citizen . . . the applicant shall be properly registered.” Id. § 16-121.01(E). \n28  Second, if the election official “matches the applicant with information that the applicant \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 5 of 35\n \n \n \n1  is not a United States citizen, the county recorder . . . shall reject the application, notify \n2  the applicant that the applicant was rejected because the applicant is not a United States \n3  citizen  and  forward  the  application  to  the  county  attorney  and  attorney  general  for \n4  investigation.” Id. Third, if the election official “is unable to match the applicant with \n5  appropriate  citizenship  information,  the  [official]  shall  notify  the  applicant  that  [her \n6  citizenship could not be verified] and that the applicant will not be qualified to vote in a \n7  presidential election or by mail with an early ballot in any election until [DPOC] is \n8  provided.” Id.  \n9  Lastly,  the  statute  mandates  prosecution  of  certain  registrants  referred  for \n10  investigation. Election officials must “make available to the attorney general a list of all \n11  individuals who are registered to vote and who have not provided satisfactory evidence of \n12  citizenship pursuant to Section 16-166.” Id. § 16-143(A). The attorney general must then \n13  use “all available resources to verify the citizenship” of the referred applicants and “at a \n14  minimum shall compare the information available on the application for registration” \n15  with the same databases listed in § 16-121.01(D) of the statute. Id. § 16-143(B). “The \n16  attorney  general  shall  prosecute  individuals  who  are  found  to  not  be  United  States \n17  citizens pursuant to § 16-182.” Id. § 16-143(D).  \n18  2.   H.B. 2243 \n19  H.B. 2243 expands the requirements imposed by H.B. 2492 for the cancellation of \n20  registrations for persons suspected of being non-citizens. Specifically, a county recorder \n21  must cancel a voter registration: \nWhen the county recorder obtains information pursuant to this section and \n22 \nconfirms that the person registered is not a United States citizen . . . . \nBefore the county recorder cancels a registration pursuant to this paragraph, \n23 \nthe county recorder shall send the person notice by forwardable mail that \nthe  person’s  registration  will  be  canceled  in  thirty-five  days  unless  the \n24 \nperson provides satisfactory evidence of United States citizenship pursuant \nto § 16-166. The notice shall include a list of documents that person may \n25 \nprovide and a postage prepaid preaddressed returned envelope. If the person \nregistered does not provide satisfactory evidence within thirty-five days, the \n26 \ncounty recorder shall cancel the registration and notify the county attorney \nand attorney general for possible investigation.  \n27 \n28 \nId. § 16-165(A)(10). H.B. 2243 also mandates monthly review of voter rolls:  \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 6 of 35\n \n \n \n1  To the extent practicable, each month the county recorder shall compare \npersons  who  are  registered  to  vote  in  that  county  and  who  the  county \n2  recorder has reason to believe are not United States citizens and persons \nwho are registered to vote without satisfactory evidence of citizenship as \n3  prescribed  by  § 16-166  with  the  systematic  alien  verification  for \nentitlements  program  maintained  by  the  United  States  citizenship  and \n4  immigration  services  to  verify  the  citizenship  status  of  the  persons \nregistered.  \n5 \n6  Id. § 16-165(I). County recorders must conduct similar checks with the Social Security \n7  Administration Database, Verification of Vital Events System, and “relevant city, town, \n8  county, state and federal databases to which the county recorder has access to confirm \n9  information obtained that requires cancellation of registrations pursuant to this section.” \n10  See id. § 16-165(G)–(K).  \n11  B.  Procedural History   \n12  On March 31, 2022, Mi Familia Vota Plaintiffs2 filed their Complaint in this \n13  Court. (Doc. 1, 03/31/2022 Mi Familia Vota Compl.) The United States and additional \n14  Private Plaintiffs subsequently filed lawsuits attacking the legality of the Voting Laws \n15  and these lawsuits were consolidated into the instant case. (E.g., Doc. 164, 11/10/2022 \n16  Order re: Consolidation.) On March 23, 2023, the parties agreed to brief motions for \n17  summary judgment only regarding issues that could be adjudicated without discovery. \n18  (See Doc. 337, Sched. Min. Entry; Doc. 338, Sched. Order.) On May 8, 2023, the State \n19  filed its Motion, moving for partial summary judgment on several of Plaintiffs’ claims \n20  that the Voting Laws are unlawful under the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”) \n21  and the Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2) \n22  (the “Materiality Provision”). (See generally State Mot.)  \n23  Specifically, the State asserts that Section 6 of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. § 20505 \n24  (“Section 6”), preempts H.B. 2492’s requirement that voters provide DPOC to vote in \n25  presidential elections. (Id. at 2–3.) The State also concedes that  Section 6 precludes \n26  Arizona from requiring DPOR to register for federal elections. (Id. at 4, 16–17.) But the \n27 \n \n2 The Court references organizational Plaintiffs that have filed collectively under the \n28 \nname  of  one  organization.  “LUCHA  Plaintiffs,”  for  example,  includes  all  additional \nPlaintiffs that are named on the briefing with LUCHA.  \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 7 of 35\n \n \n \n1  State argues that the Voting Laws’ restriction on mail-in voting is “likely” lawful under \n2  Section 6. (Id. at 3–4.) The State further argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on \n3  Plaintiffs’  claims  that  the  Voting  Laws  violate  Section  8  of  the  NVRA,  52  U.S.C. \n4  § 20507  (“Section  8”)  by  unlawfully  cancelling  voter  registrations  and  unlawfully \n5  purging  voter  rolls.  (Id.  at  5–10.)  Regarding  Plaintiffs’  claims  under  the  Materiality \n6  Provision, the State contends that the Voting Laws do not run afoul of its prohibition of \n7  denying  the  right  to  vote  based  on  immaterial  errors  or  omissions  in  a  person’s \n8  registration.  (Id.  at  10–14.)  The  State  additionally  moves  for  summary  judgment  on \n9  Plaintiff Promise Arizona’s claim that the Voting Laws are unconstitutionally vague. (Id. \n10  at 15–16.)  \n11  The RNC then filed its Motion on May 15, 2023, cross-moving for summary \n12  judgment  regarding  Arizona’s  power  to  regulate  voting  in  presidential  elections  and \n13  arguing additional issues unaddressed by the State. (See generally RNC Mot.) Asserting \n14  that the NVRA cannot lawfully regulate presidential elections, the RNC argues that H.B. \n15  2492’s DPOC requirement for presidential elections does not run afoul of Section 6. (Id. \n16  at 2–8.) The RNC also underscores that Arizona may require DPOC from mail-in voters. \n17  (Id. at 8–9.) Additionally, the RNC moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims \n18  that, inter alia, Section 8 requires Arizona to register State Form users who register \n19  without DPOC for federal elections.    \n20  On June 5, 2023, the United States and Private Plaintiffs either cross-moved for \n21  summary judgment or opposed summary judgment on all issues addressed by the State \n22  and the RNC, except that Plaintiffs agreed with the State’s conclusion regarding the \n23  Voting Laws’ DPOR requirement. (E.g., Doc. 391, USA Mot.) Specifically, Plaintiffs \n24  cross-move for summary judgment on all  Section 6 claims, arguing that the  NVRA \n25  preempts H.B. 2492’s limitations on presidential and mail-in voting, as well as H.B. \n26  2492’s  DPOR  requirement.  (E.g.,  Doc.  393,  DNC  Mot.  at  5–15;  Doc.  390,  Tohono \n27  O’odham  Mot.  at  4–10.)  Plaintiffs  also  argue  that  the  Court  should  grant  summary \n28  judgment to Plaintiffs on their claim that  the Voting Laws contravene Section 8 by \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 8 of 35\n \n \n \n1  enabling  cancellation  of  registrations  within  90  days  of  an  election.3  (Doc.  396, \n2  AAANHPI Mot. at 3–7; DNC Mot. at 16.) Mi Familia Vota cross-moves for summary \n3  judgment on its Materiality Provision claims, while the United States and LUCHA argue \n4  that issues of fact preclude summary judgment. (USA Mot. at 16–25; Doc. 394, LUCHA \n5  Mot. at 5–7; Doc. 399, Mi Familia Vota Mot. at 1–9.) Poder Latinx also moves for \n6  summary judgment on its § 10101 claim. (Doc. 397, Poder Latinx Mot. at 1–8.) But \n7  Plaintiffs contend that fact issues preclude summary judgment on their claims that the \n8  Voting Laws violate Section 8 by mandating cancellation for reasons not permitted by the \n9  NVRA; subjecting registrants to nonuniform and discriminatory voter roll maintenance \n10  programs; and failing to ensure all eligible applicants to vote are registered to vote within \n11  30 days of an election. (LUCHA Mot. at 13–15; AAANHPI Mot. at 8–13; Poder Latinx \n12  Mot.  at  8–16.)  Promise  Arizona  also  opposes  summary  judgment  on  its  void-for-\n13  vagueness claim. (See generally Doc. 395, Promise Arizona Resp.) \n14  The State and the RNC responded and replied to Plaintiffs’ filings on July 5, 2023, \n15  to which Plaintiffs replied on July 19, 2023. (Doc. 436, State Reply; Doc. 442, RNC \n16  Reply; Doc. 473, Tohono O’odham Reply; Doc. 474, Poder Latinx Reply; Doc. 475, \n17  DNC Reply; Doc. 476, USA Reply; Doc. 477, AAANHPI Reply; Doc. 478, Mi Familia \n18  Vota Reply.) The Court heard oral argument on all Motions and Cross-Motions on July \n19  25, 2023. (Doc. 479, Min. Entry.)  \n20  II.  LEGAL STANDARDS & ANALYSIS \n21    Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment is properly granted \n22  when: (1) there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact; and (2) after viewing the \n23  evidence most favorably to the non-moving party, the movant is clearly entitled to prevail \n24  as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322–23 \n25  (1986); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 815 F.2d 1285, 1288–89 (9th Cir. 1987). A fact \n26  is “material” when, under the governing substantive law, it could affect the outcome of \n27 \n \n3 Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on their claim that Section 8(a) of the \n28 \nNVRA prevents Arizona for requiring DPOC to vote in presidential elections, but the \nCourt will not reach this claim.  \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 9 of 35\n \n \n \n1  the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  \n2  A.  NVRA  \n3  For  the  following  reasons,  the  Court  concludes  that  Section  6  preempts  H.B. \n4  2492’s (1) DPOR requirement; (2) restriction on voting in presential elections; and (3) \n5  restriction on mail-in voting. The Court also concludes that Section 8(c) of the NVRA \n6  forecloses enforcement of the Voting Laws’ systematic purge provisions within 90 days \n7  of any federal elections. However, with the exception of Plaintiffs’ argument that Section \n8  8(b) applies to pre-registration oversight and the parties’ arguments regarding registering \n9  State Form users for federal elections, the Court finds that there are genuine issues of \n10  material fact precluding summary judgment regarding whether certain provisions of the \n11  Voting Laws contravene Sections 8(a) and (b) of the NVRA.  \n12  1.  Section 6 \n13  Section 6 of the NVRA requires that states “accept and use” the Federal Form to \n14  register voters in federal elections. 52 U.S.C. § 20505(a)(1); Inter Tribal, 570 U.S. at 9. \n15  Certain Plaintiffs and the State contend that H.B. 2492 violates Section 6 by requiring \n16  Federal Form users to submit DPOR. (See Doc. 390, Tohono O’odham Mot. at 3–5.) All \n17  parties  who  briefed  this  issue  agree  that  Section  6  preempts  H.B.  2492’s  DPOR \n18  requirement. The Court will grant summary judgment on this issue.4 (Id.; State Reply at \n19  14; see Doc. 502, Hr’g Tr. at 40:18–41:18.) The parties dispute whether H.B. 2492’s \n20  requirements that registrants provide DPOC to vote (1) in presidential elections and (2) \n21  by mail are legal under the NVRA. (E.g., DNC Mot. at 5; RNC Mot. at 2–9.)  \n22  A state law may be preempted if, inter alia, Congress makes an express statement \n23  to displace state law, “it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and \n24  federal  requirements,”  or  a  state  law  “creates  an  unacceptable  obstacle  to  the \n25  accomplishment  and  execution  of  the  full  purposes  and  objectives  of  Congress.” \n26  Chamber of Commerce v. Bonta, 62 F.4th 473, 482 (9th Cir. 2023) (internal citation and \n27  quotation marks omitted). The Court finds that Section 6 preempts both H.B. 2492’s \n \n28  4 The State also agrees with Tohono O’odham Plaintiffs’ requested clarifications about \nthe DPOR requirement. (State Reply at 46–50.) \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 10 of 35\n \n \n \n1  requirement  that  registrants  provide  DPOC  to  vote  in  presidential  elections  and  its \n2  restriction on mail-in voting.5  \n3  a.   Presidential Elections \n4  All  Plaintiffs  and  the  State  contend  that  Section  6  preempts  H.B.  2492’s \n5  requirement  that  Federal  Form  users  provide  DPOC  in  order  to  vote  in  presidential \n6  elections. (State Mot. at 2; e.g., USA Mot. at 7–10; DNC Mot. at 5–6.) The RNC counters \n7  that such preemption arguments “ignore[] the constitutional constraints on Congress’s \n8  power to regulate presidential elections,” and “applying the NVRA only to congressional \n9  elections gives proper effect to Elections Clause, the Electors Clause, the NVRA, and \n10  H.B. 2492.” (RNC Mot. at 2–6); see also U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 2 (“Electors Clause”) \n11  (“Each  State  shall  appoint,  in  such  Manner  as  the  Legislature  thereof  may  direct,” \n12  presidential  electors).  The  Court  agrees  with  Plaintiffs  and  the  State  that  Section  6 \n13  preempts H.B. 2492’s limitation on voting in presidential elections.  \n14  The plain language of the NVRA reflects an intent to regulate all elections for \n15  “[f]ederal office,” including for “President or Vice President.” 52 U.S.C. §§ 20507(a), \n16  30101(3); California Restaurant Ass’n v. City of Berkeley, 65 F.4th 1045, 1050 (9th Cir. \n17  2023) (“As with any express preemption case, our focus is on the plain meaning of [the \n18  statute].”).  And  binding  precedent  indicates  that  Congress  has  the  power  to  control \n19  registration for presidential elections. See 52 U.S.C. §§ 20502(a), 30101(3) (NVRA sets \n20  criteria for registering for “[f]ederal office”; defining “[f]ederal office” to include office \n21  of the president). In 1934, the United States Supreme Court rejected a narrow framing of \n22  Congress’s power over presidential elections, writing: \n23  The only point of the constitutional objection necessary to be considered is \nthat the power of appointment of presidential electors and the manner of \n24  their  appointment  are  expressly  committed  by  section  1,  art.  2,  of  the \nConstitution to the states, and that the congressional authority is thereby \n25  limited to determining ‘the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on \nwhich they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout \n26  the United States.’ So narrow a view of the powers of Congress in respect \nof the matter is without warrant. \n27 \n \n28  5 The Court will not reach Mi Familia Vota Plaintiffs’ related Section 8(a) claim as it \napplies to Federal Form users. (See Mi Familia Vota Mot. at 15 n.12.)  \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 11 of 35\n \n \n \n1  Burroughs v. United States, 290 U.S. 534, 544 (1934). While Burroughs specifically \n2  addressed the constitutionality of a federal statute regulating campaign contributions in \n3  presidential elections, the Supreme Court later wrote that the decision more generally \n4  “recognized broad congressional power to legislate in connection with the elections of the \n5  President and Vice President.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 13 n.16 (1976).  \n6    Drawing on this authority, the Ninth Circuit has recognized Congress’s power to \n7  regulate all federal elections under the NVRA. In Voting Rights Coalition v. Wilson, the \n8  Ninth Circuit rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the NVRA, holding that \n9  because Congress has power under the Elections Clause to “alter state laws pertaining to \n10  the ‘Times, Places and Manner’ of electing Representatives and Senators,” the NVRA \n11  may  constitutionally  “conscript  state  agencies  to  carry  out  voter  registration  for  the \n12  election of Representatives and Senators. The exercise of that power by Congress is by its \n13  terms intended to be borne by the states without compensation.” 60 F.3d 1411, 1413–15 \n14  (9th  Cir.  1995)  (citing  U.S.  Const.  art.  I,  §  4,  cl.  1  (“Elections  Clause”)).  And \n15  acknowledging that “the Supreme Court has read the grant of power to Congress in \n16  Article I, section 4 as quite broad,” the Ninth Circuit added that “the broad power given \n17  to Congress over congressional elections has been extended to presidential elections.” Id. \n18  at 1414 (citing Burroughs, 290 U.S. at 545). The DNC and RNC dispute whether the \n19  latter rationale is dicta. (RNC Reply at 5; DNC Reply at 7–8.) But the DNC persuasively \n20  raises that this “broad” reading of the Elections Clause must have been essential to the \n21  Ninth  Circuit’s  decision  to  deem  the  NVRA  constitutional,  as  the  NVRA  plainly \n22  regulates congressional and presidential elections. (See DNC Reply at 8.)  \n23    The parties also dispute the impact of Inter Tribal Council on whether the NVRA \n24  constitutionally regulates presidential elections. (DNC Mot. at 5–7; RNC Mot. at 2–7; \n25  RNC Reply at 3–4.) Contrary to the RNC’s arguments, Inter Tribal Council underscores \n26  that the Elections Clause gives Congress the power to regulate all federal elections, and \n27  that Congress intended to exercise this power through the NVRA to preempt conflicting \n28  state laws. The Inter Tribal Court affirmed the states’ power to “establish qualifications \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 12 of 35\n \n \n \n1  (such  as  citizenship)  for  voting”  on  the  basis  that  “the  Elections  Clause  empowers \n2  Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.” 570 \n3  U.S. at 16 (emphasis original).6 And the Court described the full preemptive impact of \n4  the NVRA: \nThe assumption that Congress is reluctant to pre-empt does not hold when \n5 \nCongress  acts  under  that  constitutional  provision,  which  empowers \nCongress to “make or alter” state election regulations. Art. I, § 4, cl. 1. \n6 \nWhen Congress legislates with respect to the “Times, Places and Manner” \nof holding congressional elections, it necessarily displaces some element of \n7 \na pre-existing legal regime erected by the States. Because the power the \nElections Clause confers is none other than the power to pre-empt, the \n8 \nreasonable assumption is that the [NVRA’s] text accurately communicates \nthe scope of Congress’s pre-emptive intent. \n9 \n10  Id. at 14. The Supreme Court also foreclosed the Tenth Amendment argument offered by \n11  the  RNC,  reasoning  that  “[u]nlike  the  States’  historic  police  powers,  States’  role  in \n12  regulating congressional elections—while weighty and worthy of respect—has always \n13  existed subject to the express qualification that it terminates according to federal law.” Id. \n14  at 15 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also 1 Story § 627 (“It is no \n15  original prerogative of state power to appoint a representative, a senator, or president for \n16  the union”); (USA Mot. at 14 (citing Cook v. Gralike, 531 U.S. 510, 522 (2001)); RNC \n17  Mot. at 4.) Inter Tribal Council and additional controlling authority indicate that H.B. \n18  2492’s restriction on Federal Form users voting in presidential elections is expressly \n19  preempted by Section 6.7     \n20  b.   Voting by Mail  \n21    Plaintiffs  also  contend  that  Section  6  preempts  H.B.  2492’s  requirement  that \n22  Federal Form users provide DPOC in order to vote by mail. (E.g., DNC Mot. at 7.) The \n23 \n \n6 The RNC argues that in Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970), “[f]ive Justices took \n24 \nthe position that the Elections Clause did not confer upon Congress the power to regulate \nvoter qualifications in federal elections.” (RNC Mot. at 5 (quoting Inter Tribal Council, \n25 \n570 U.S. at 16 n.8).) But this assertion has no impact on any Motion, as Section 6 does \nnot regulate voter qualifications. \n26  7 Contending that the Elections Clause was not the only source of congressional power \nbehind the NVRA, the DNC argues that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments also \n27 \nlegitimize the statute’s regulation of presidential elections. (DNC Mot. at 2.) Because the \nCourt concludes that the Elections Clause gives Congress power to regulate presidential \n28 \nelections under the NVRA, it need not reach any argument regarding the Fourteenth and \nFifteenth Amendments.  \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 13 of 35\n \n \n \n1  RNC counters that the NVRA does not apply to voting by mail or the “mechanisms for . . \n2  . voting,” but only to registering to vote. (RNC Mot. at 4, 4 n.2, 8.) The State similarly \n3  asserts that H.B. 2492’s mail-in voting restriction is “likely not” preempted, as Section 6 \n4  pertains to “what states must do ‘for the registration’ of voters.” (State Mot. at 3–4 \n5  (quoting § 20505(a)(1)) (emphasis in original).) But both the text and purpose of the \n6  NVRA contradict Defendants’ narrow framing of the statute.  \n7    The text of the NVRA provides for circumstances where a state may limit voting \n8  by mail, implying that a state may not limit absentee voting outside of these prescribed \n9  circumstances.  52 U.S.C. § 20505(c)(1) (permitting states to require first-time voters to \n10  vote in person if those voters registered to vote by mail), (c)(2) (clarifying that paragraph \n11  (c)(1) does not apply to individuals who are otherwise entitled to an absentee ballot under \n12  federal law); (see also DNC Mot. at 9.) Had Congress intended to permit states that allow \n13  absentee voting to require in-person voting under additional circumstances—including \n14  when an registrant fails to provide DPOC—it could have said so in the NVRA. See \n15  N.L.R.B. v. SW General, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 929, 940 (2017) (explaining that the interpretive \n16  canon  expressio  unius  est  exclusio  alterius  applies  when  “circumstances  support  a \n17  sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded”) (internal \n18  citation  and  quotation  marks  omitted).  Not  only  does  the  statute  exclude  failure  to \n19  provide DPOC among the reasons a state may require an individual to vote in person, but \n20  as explained below, the purpose of the NVRA supports an inference that Congress meant \n21  to limit the number of circumstances in which a state could prevent an individual from \n22  voting by mail.  \n23    Regarding the purpose of the NVRA, Congress recorded that it enacted the NVRA \n24  not just to “establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who \n25  register to vote in elections for Federal office,” but also to “to make it possible for \n26  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments  to  implement  this  chapter  in  a  manner  that \n27  enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in elections for Federal office.” \n28  52  U.S.C.  § 20501(b)(1)–(2)  (emphasis  added).  Further,  Congress  found  that \n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 14 of 35\n \n \n \n1  “discriminatory  and  unfair  registration  laws  and  procedures  can  have  a  direct  and \n2  damaging  effect  on  voter  participation  in  elections  for  Federal  office  and \n3  disproportionately  harm  voter  participation  by  various  groups,  including  racial \n4  minorities” and it is the duty of “Federal, State, and local governments to promote the \n5  exercise of the [fundamental] right” to vote. Id. § 20501(a) (emphasis added).  \n6  Given Congress’s purpose behind the NVRA, the DNC correctly raises not only \n7  that the statute’s DPOC requirement to vote by mail is directly preempted by Section 6, \n8  but also that obstacle preemption bars the statute’s enforcement. (DNC Reply at 2.) \n9  “What is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to be informed by examining the \n10  federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.” Crosby v. \n11  Nat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 373 (2000). “If the purpose of the act cannot \n12  otherwise  be  accomplished—if  its  operation  within  its  chosen  field  else  must  be \n13  frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural effect—the state law must yield to \n14  the  regulation  of  Congress  within  the  sphere  of  its  delegated  power.”  Id.  (citation \n15  omitted). No party contests that Congress at least has the power to regulate congressional \n16  elections,  and  the  findings  and  purposes  included  in  the  NVRA  reflect  an  intent  to \n17  increase  voter  turnout,  largely  but  not  exclusively  through  diminishing  barriers  to \n18  registration.  Roughly  89  percent  of  Arizona  voters  cast  ballots  by  mail  in  the  2020 \n19  election, indicating that most eligible Arizonans choose to vote by mail. (Non-US SOF \n20  ¶ 60.) By offering mail-in voting to registrants who provided DPOC but not to Federal \n21  Form registrants who omitted such documentation, H.B. 2492’s mail-in voting restriction \n22  disadvantages Federal Form users by placing an additional burden—which is not required \n23  by the Federal Form—on federal-only voters to exercise Arizona’s preferred method of \n24  casting a ballot. See Inter Tribal, 570 U.S. at 15 (“[A] state-imposed requirement of \n25  evidence  of  citizenship  not  required  by  the  Federal  Form  is  ‘inconsistent  with’  the \n26  NVRA’s mandate that States ‘accept and use’ the Federal Form.”)  H.B. 2492’s limitation \n27  on  voting  by  mail  frustrates  the  purpose  of  the  NVRA,  as  it  impedes  Arizona’s \n28  “promot[ion] of the right” to vote. 52 U.S.C. § 20501(a). This limitation presents an \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 15 of 35\n \n \n \n1  “obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress’s full objectives under the” NVRA, and the \n2  Court “find[s] that the state law undermines the intended purpose and ‘natural effect’” of \n3  the NVRA. Crosby, 530 U.S. at 373 (citation omitted).  \n4  2.  Section 8 \n5  Section 8 of the NVRA mandates that states respect additional requirements when \n6  administering  registration  and  roll  maintenance  programs.  See  generally  52  U.S.C. \n7  § 20507. The State and the RNC move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims that \n8  (1) H.B. 2243 unlawfully allows for cancellation of registration within 90 days of an \n9  election; (2) H.B. 2243 allows cancellation for reasons unsanctioned by the NVRA; (3) \n10  the Voting Laws enable nonuniform and discriminatory maintenance procedures; and (4) \n11  H.B. 2492 fails to ensure that all eligible State Form users are registered to vote in federal \n12  elections. (State Mot. at 5–10; RNC Reply at 9–12.) Plaintiffs also move for summary \n13  judgment on H.B. 2243’s cancellation of registration within 90 days of an election, but \n14  oppose summary judgment on all other issues.  \n15  a.   Cancellation Within 90 Days of Election    \n16  Section 8(c)(2) mandates that States “shall complete, not later than 90 days prior \n17  to the date of a primary or general election for Federal office, any program the purpose of \n18  which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of \n19  eligible voters” (“90-day Provision”). 52 U.S.C. § 20507(c)(2)(A). While states must \n20  pause any such systematic purge within 90 days of a federal election, States may continue \n21  to implement individualized8 removal programs within this 90-day window. See Arcia, \n22  772 F.3d at 1344–45 (discussing whether a program to remove noncitizens from the voter \n23  rolls  within  90  days  of  an  election  by,  inter  alia,  running  registrants  through  the \n24  Systematic  Alien  Verification  for  Entitlements  system  is  a  systematic  program \n25  contravening Section 8). The NVRA enumerates certain exceptions to the prohibition on \n26  removals before an election, which are “criminal conviction or mental incapacity,” “the \n \n27  8 An “individualized” removal program means one in which a state determines eligibility \nto vote with “individualized information or investigation” rather than cancelling batches \n28 \nof registrations based on a set procedure. See Arcia v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, \n1344 (11th Cir. 2014). \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 16 of 35\n \n \n \n1  death of a registrant,” “a change in the residence of the registrant,” or “correction of \n2  registration records pursuant to this chapter.” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(3)–(4), (c)(2)(B).   \n3  Plaintiffs assert that the Voting Laws violate  Section 8(c) because they allow \n4  systematic  cancellation  of  registrations  within  90  days  of  federal  elections.  (E.g., \n5  AAANHPI Mot. at 8–10.) The Court agrees. The Voting Laws contain no provision \n6  limiting systematic roll review and registration cancellation to at least 90 days prior to a \n7  federal election.9 (See id.); A.R.S. § 16-165(G)–(K). The State acknowledges that the \n8  Voting Laws fail to limit systematic purges within 90 days of an election, but claims that \n9  Section 8 does not prevent states from cancelling registrations of voters found to be \n10  noncitizens within this 90-day window. (State Mot. at 9.) Though all parties agree that \n11  citizenship is a requirement for voting, the State ignores the text and purpose of the 90-\n12  day provision.  \n13  The 90-day Provision prohibits systematic cancellation of registrations within 90 \n14  days of an election. First, Section 8 plainly forbids “any program” to routinely remove \n15  registrants, subject to enumerated exceptions, and “the phrase ‘any program’ suggests \n16  that the 90 Day Provision has a broad meaning. . . . [R]ead naturally, the word ‘any’ has \n17  an expansive meaning, that is ‘one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.’” Arcia, \n18  772 F.3d at 1344 (quoting United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997)). And “[w]here \n19  Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional \n20  exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative \n21  intent.” Id. at 1345 (quoting Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616–17 (1980)). \n22  Second, the Court agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that the 90-day provision “is designed \n23  to carefully balance [the] . . . purposes in the NVRA,” which include protecting the \n24  integrity of the electoral process and ensuring that accurate rolls are maintained, yet also \n25  fostering procedures that will “enhance[] the participation of eligible citizens as voters in \n \n26  9 The DNC seeks summary judgment on its claim that H.B. 2492 violates Section 8 \nbecause  “it  places  no  time  limit  on  the  direction  to  county  recorders  to  cancel \n27 \nregistrations when they ‘receive[] and confirm[] information that [a] person registered is \nnot’ a U.S. citizen.” (DNC Mot. at 16 (quoting H.B. 2492) (alterations in original).) This \n28 \nprovision of H.B. 2492 was superseded by H.B. 2243. Compare H.B. 2492, § 8, with \nH.B. 2243, § 2.  \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 17 of 35\n \n \n \n1  elections for Federal office.” Id. at 1346. It makes sense that Congress “decided to be \n2  more cautious” leading up to an election cycle, as systematic cancellation programs can \n3  cause inaccurate removal and “[e]ligible voters removed days or weeks before Election \n4  Day will likely not be able to correct the State’s errors in time to vote.” Id.; (see Non-US \n5  SOF ¶¶ 48–49.) But individualized removals, not expressly forbidden within the 90-day \n6  window, are based on more “rigorous” registrant-specific inquiries “leading to a smaller \n7  chance for mistakes.” Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1346.  \n8  The State’s arguments to the contrary do not persuade the Court. Relying heavily \n9  on United States v. Florida, 870 F. Supp. 2d 1346, 1350 (D. Fla. 2012), the State argues \n10  that the 90-day Provision does not “apply to removing noncitizens who were not properly \n11  registered in the first place.” (State Mot. at 9 (quoting Florida, 870 F. Supp. 2d at 1350).) \n12  Yet the State ignores that the Eleventh Circuit rejected Florida’s reasoning in Arcia. See \n13  Arcia v. Detzner, NO. 12–22282–CIV–ZLOCH, 2015 WL 11198230, at *1 n.1 (S.D. Fla. \n14  Feb. 12, 2015) (describing conclusion reversed in Arcia as the same one reached in \n15  United States v. Florida). The State also relies on Bell v. Marinko, 367 F.3d 588 (6th Cir. \n16  2004),  in  which  the  Sixth  Circuit  upheld  a  state  statute  enabling  purges  of  precinct \n17  nonresidents within the 90-day window. But the Bell Court did not expressly consider the \n18  effect of individualized purges, the dual purposes of Section 8, or the plain meaning of \n19  “any” in Section 8(c)(2)(A). Bell, 367 F.3d at 591–92. Further, the facts of Bell are \n20  distinguishable from the Voting Laws. The statute at issue in Bell provided for individual \n21  “challenge  hearings,”  which  were  “devoted  to  investigating  each  [registrant’s] \n22  residence,” before an alleged nonresident was purged from the voter roll. Id. at 590.  \n23  The State alternatively asks the Court to read the 90-day Provision into the Voting \n24  Laws, “harmoniz[ing]” the statutes with another Arizona law that mandates compliance \n25  with the NVRA, while Equity Coalition requests a declaration that Section 2 of H.B. \n26  2243 violates the 90-day Provision. (State Mot. at 10; AAANHPI Mot. at 7–8, 10.) While \n27  the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the State may still conduct individualized voter \n28  removals within the 90-day window, the systematic removal program mandated by H.B. \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 18 of 35\n \n \n \n1  2243 violates Section 8(c)(2) of the NVRA. \n2  b.  Grounds for Cancellation  \n3  As described above, Section 8(a) lists the grounds upon which a State can cancel \n4  registrations for federal elections. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(3)–(4). According to Defendant \n5  Fontes, “H.B. 2243 do[es] not specify what type, set, or combination of ‘information’ \n6  establishes that a registered voter ‘is not a United States citizen’ or what information is \n7  sufficient to match an individual in a database with the registered voter or applicant, and . \n8  . . some United States citizens may be erroneously flagged as non-citizens based on \n9  potentially outdated and inaccurate data.” (Non-US SOF ¶ 49 (quoting Doc. 189, Sec’y of \n10  State Ans. ¶ 44).) Additionally, “if a county recorder obtains information and confirms \n11  that a registered voter is not a United States citizen, which may be based on potentially \n12  unreliable  and  outdated  sources,  and  if,  after  receiving  a  notice,  the  voter  does  not \n13  provide proof of citizenship within 35 days, the recorder must cancel the registration and \n14  notify the county attorney and Attorney General for possible investigation.” (Id. ¶ 50 \n15  (quoting Ex. 21, Doc. 63, 22-cv-1381, Sec’y of State Ans. ¶ 12).) The State argues that \n16  because “citizenship is a basic requirement for voting,” the Voting Laws’ cancellation \n17  provision cannot violate Section 8 as a matter of law, otherwise the NVRA “would \n18  effectively grant, and then protect, the franchise of persons not eligible to vote.” (State \n19  Mot. at 8.)   \n20  Plaintiffs  correctly  counter  that  “[t]he  very  real  fact  questions  about  voters’ \n21  citizenship status and how successful the removal scheme will be in identifying truly \n22  ineligible voters make summary judgment inappropriate here.” (AAANHPI Mot. at 12.) \n23  The State admits that only registrants suspected of being noncitizens are subjected to \n24  arguably unreliable database checks, which Plaintiffs may be able to prove result in \n25  inaccurate  identification  of  noncitizens,  cancellation  of  registration  for  reasons  not \n26  permitted by the NVRA, and wrongful referral for prosecution. (Non-US SOF ¶¶ 45–50.) \n27  And again, the Court is not persuaded by the State’s sparsely substantiated argument that \n28  Arizona may freely cancel voter registrations of those individuals suspected of being \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 19 of 35\n \n \n \n1  noncitizens merely because some such individuals might actually be noncitizens, nor \n2  does this outcome raise constitutional concerns. Supra Section II(A)(2)(a); Arcia, 772 \n3  F.3d at 1347–48 (Section 8 would raise constitutional concerns if it entirely prohibited \n4  states from removing noncitizens from voter rolls, but case did not present that question). \n5  The  Court  concludes  that  there  remains  an  issue  of  fact  as  to  whether  the  purge \n6  procedures  mandated  by  H.B.  2243  will  likely  result  in  unlawful  cancellation  of \n7  legitimate voter registrations.  \n8  c.  Discriminatory Maintenance Procedures  \n9  The State seeks summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claim that the Voting Laws \n10  violate Section 8(b) of the NVRA, titled “Confirmation of voter registration,” which \n11  mandates that “[a]ny State program or activity to protect the integrity of the electoral \n12  process by ensuring the maintenance of an accurate and current voter registration roll for \n13  elections for Federal office . . . shall be uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance \n14  with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b). Plaintiffs claim that the \n15  Voting  Laws  violate  Section  8(b)  by  treating  federal-only  and  full-ballot  voters \n16  differently and imposing “disparate treatment as between naturalized citizens and U.S.-\n17  born citizens, as well as within and between Arizona counties.” (E.g., Poder Latinx Mot. \n18  at 8–9.) Specifically,  Plaintiffs oppose summary judgment on the grounds that there \n19  remain factual issues regarding the effects of the allegedly discriminatory verification \n20  procedures mandated by the Voting Laws. (Id. at 9.)  \n21  As  a  threshold  issue,  the  State  argues  that  Section  8(b)  only  applies  to  post-\n22  registration voter roll maintenance, namely purges, and the State is entitled to judgment \n23  as a matter of law on any claim that the State treats applicants to vote in a nonuniform or \n24  discriminatory way. (State Mot. at 5–6.) Based on the plain language of the NVRA, the \n25  Court agrees with the State only to the extent the State argues that Section 8(b) does not \n26  apply to state programs regarding individuals not yet registered to vote. Section 8(b), \n27  which expressly addresses confirming rather than soliciting voter registration, speaks to \n28  ensuring the maintenance, not the enlargement, of current voter registration rolls. See 52 \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 20 of 35\n \n \n \n1  U.S.C. § 20507(b); (see also State Mot. at 5–6 (discussing legislative history indicating \n2  that Section 8(b) was intended “to prohibit selective or discriminatory purge programs”).) \n3  Binding authority supports this interpretation, and Plaintiffs cite no case or make no \n4  argument to otherwise persuade the Court. See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., \n5  138 S.Ct. 1833, 1840 (2018) (referencing § 20507(b)(1) as a “limitation applicable to \n6  state removal programs”).  \n7  The  Court  will  deny  summary  judgment  on  Plaintiffs’  remaining  claims  that \n8  Section  8(b)  forbids  the  State  from  (1)  cancelling  existing  voter  registrations  of \n9  individuals  identified  as  noncitizens  after  running  certain  individuals  through  (an) \n10  unreliable database(s) and (2) referring certain individuals for investigation based on such \n11  unreliable data. The Secretary of State admitted that H.B. 2243 “requires a different \n12  ‘standard, practice, or procedure’ for determining a voter’s qualifications for voters who a \n13  county recorder ‘has reason to believe are not United States citizens’ than for voters who \n14  a county recorder does not have reason to believe are not United States citizens.” 10 (Non-\n15  US SOF ¶ 44 (citing Sec’y of State Ans. ¶ 102)); A.R.S. § 16-165(I). And the Secretary \n16  specifically admitted that H.B. 2243 mandates that county recorders distinguish between \n17  those registrants who will be subjected to the additional Systematic Alien Verification \n18  Entitlements  program  screens  and  those  who  “are  not  suspected  of  lacking  U.S. \n19  citizenship [and] will not be subjected to the investigation and potential cancellations \n20  [sic] provisions set forth in H.B. 2243.” (Id. ¶ 45 (citing Sec’y of State Ans. ¶¶ 102–03).); \n21  § 16-165(I). As the Court concludes that there are outstanding issues of fact as to how \n22  this  purging  will  be  executed  and  whether  it  causes  nonuniform  and  discriminatory \n23  registration investigation and cancellation, the Court denies summary judgment on these \n \n24  10 Poder Latinx seeks summary judgment on its claim that the verification procedures’ \n“reason to believe” standard violates 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A), which prohibits the \n25 \nState from “apply[ing] any standard, practice, or procedure” to determine an individual’s \nqualification  to  vote  that  is  “different  from  the  standards,  practices,  or  procedures \n26 \napplied” to other individuals “found by State officials to be qualified to vote.” Because \nthere remain issues of fact of when and how a county recorder will have “reason to \n27 \nbelieve” that a registered voter is a non-citizen and use the Systematic Alien Verification \nfor Entitlements program to verify citizenship, the Court denies as moot Poder Latinx \n28 \nPlaintiffs’ Motion on its 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A) claim.

State Form Users Registering for Federal Elections  \n3  Section 8(a) of the NVRA mandates that States “ensure that any eligible applicant \n4  is registered to vote in an election” when an applicant submits registration materials at \n5  least 30 days before an election. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1); see also A.R.S. § 16-120(A) (a \n6  registrant “shall not vote in an election called pursuant to the laws of this state unless the . \n7  .  .  [individual’s]  registration  has  been  received  by  the  county  recorder  .  .  .  before \n8  midnight of the twenty-ninth day preceding the date of the election”). Plaintiffs argue, \n9  inter alia, that the Voting Laws contravene Section 8(a) by mandating that applicants \n10  who submit a State Form by mail or at public assistance agencies must provide DPOC in \n11  order  to  be  registered  for  any  election.12  (LUCHA  Mot.  at  14.)  Countering  that  the \n12  NVRA does not require states to register applicants not actually eligible to vote under \n13  state  criteria,  namely  “known  noncitizens,”  the  RNC  seeks  summary  judgment  on \n14  Plaintiffs’ claim that H.B. 2492 contravenes Section 8(a)’s requirement that states ensure \n15  all eligible applicants to vote are actually registered to vote. (RNC Mot. at 2, 9–11; \n16  LUCHA Mot. at 13–14.)  \n17  This claim is resolved by the existing LULAC Consent Decree, which requires \n18  Arizona “County Recorders to accept State Form applications submitted without DPOC . \n19  .  .  [and]  to  immediately  register  the  applicants  for  federal  elections,  provided  the \n20  applicant is otherwise qualified and the voter registration form is sufficiently complete.” \n \n21  11 The State “takes no position” on whether the Voting Laws “as applied, result in a non-\nuniform or discriminatory program for maintaining accurate  registration lists.” (State \n22 \nMot. at 6 n.12 (emphasis in original).) Offering an expansive definition of the term “non-\nuniform” as “apply[ing] to less than an entire jurisdiction,” the State argues that the \n23 \nVoting Laws still facially pass muster under Section 8(b). (Id. at 6.) But the State does \nnot address that even the text of the Voting Laws mandates purges that apply to “less than \n24 \nan entire jurisdiction,” as only those registrants whom recorders have “reason to believe” \nare noncitizens will be subject to heightened scrutiny through, inter alia, the Systematic \n25 \nAlien  Verification  for  Entitlements  program.  The  Court  need  not  endorse  a  specific \ndefinition  of  uniformity  or  parse  Plaintiffs’  facial  and  as-applied  arguments  to  deny \n26 \nsummary judgment on the Section 8(b) claim.  \n12 The Court has already explained that Section 6 precludes Arizona from requiring \n27 \nDPOC from Federal Form users and will grant summary judgment regarding the Voting \nLaws’  DPOR  requirement,  so  the  Court  need  not  address  the  parties’  arguments \n28 \nregarding the effect of Section 8(a) in these respects.

(Doc.  196,  MTD  Hr’g  Tr.  at  62:3–4;  see  also  Doc.  67, \nLUCHA  Compl.  ¶ 90  (requiring  DPOC  for  State  Form  user  to  register  for  federal \n21 \nelections “requires the Secretary to violate a federal consent decree”); but see Doc. 388-4, \nEx. 19, Veto Letter from Recorder Cazares-Kelly at 1 (automatic State form rejection \n22 \n“had been eliminated by the consent decree in the LULAC case so that currently all \nvoters are treated the same”). The State Form elicits the same information for federal-\n23 \nonly voters as the Federal Form. (Compare State Form (federal-only information shaded \nred) with Federal Form at 26.) The State Form informs applicants that they will only be \n24 \nregistered for “full ballot” elections if they provide proof of citizenship, but absent DPOC \nand  the  Birthplace  Requirement  discussed  below,  the  State  Form’s  requirements  are \n25 \nsubstantively indistinguishable from the Federal Form. As long as Arizona has chosen to \nproduce a State Form that offers registration for federal elections, it must abide by the \n26 \nrequirements outlined in Section 6, cross-referenced to Section 8. See § 20505(a)(2) (“In \naddition to accepting and using the [Federal Form], a State may develop and use a mail \n27 \nvoter registration form that meets all of the criteria stated in section 20508(b) of this title \nfor the registration of voters in elections for Federal office.”).

The Materiality Provision was “intended to \n6  address the practice of requiring unnecessary information for voter registration with the \n7  intent that such requirements would increase the number of errors or omissions on the \n8  application forms, thus providing an excuse to disqualify potential voters.” Schwier v. \n9  Cox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1294 (11th Cir. 2003). To be qualified to vote in Arizona, a person \n10  must be at least eighteen years old, a current United States citizen, and a current resident \n11  of Arizona. Ariz. Const. art. VII § 2. \n12  The State asserts that the Checkbox Requirement and Birthplace Requirement do \n13  not violate the Materiality Provision because citizenship is material in determining a \n14  person’s eligibility to vote and birthplace is material in determining a person’s identity. \n15  (State Mot. at 10–14.) The Court concludes that the Checkbox Requirement violates the \n16  Materiality Provision when a person provides Arizona with DPOC. But the Court finds \n17  that  there  are  genuine  issues  of  fact  precluding  summary  judgment  on  whether  the \n18  Birthplace Requirement contravenes the Materiality Provision. \n19  1.  The Checkbox Requirement \n20  The  State  contends  that  the  Checkbox  Requirement  does  not  violate  the \n21  Materiality Provision because “citizenship is a requirement for voting in Arizona.” (Id. at \n22  11–13.) The United States counters that whether the Checkbox Requirement violates the \n23  Materiality Provision is question of fact inappropriate for summary judgment. (USA Mot. \n24  at 17–20.) Specifically, the United States contends that further discovery is necessary \n25 \n \n14 Plaintiffs do not dispute that the State can require DPOC to vote in state elections, but \n26 \nPlaintiffs  do  claim  that  requiring  federal-only  voters  to  provide  DPOC  to  vote  in \npresidential elections and by mail violates the Materiality Provision. (E.g., Doc. 1, 22-cv-\n27 \n1124, USA Compl. ¶¶ 69–70; see generally USA Mot.; Mi Familia Vota Mot.; LUCHA \nMot.) Because requiring DPOC for federal-only voters to vote in presidential elections \n28 \nand by mail violates Section 6, the Court need not address the parties’ arguments as they \nrelate to the Materiality Provision. (See State Mot. at 13.)  \n \n- 23 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 24 of 35\n \n \n \n1  because the State posits without any “record evidence supporting its assertions,” that the \n2  Checkbox Requirement is “useful.” (Id. at 19.)  \n3  No party disputes that citizenship itself is material to a voter’s eligibility to vote. \n4  (E.g., id.at 18.) And the Court finds persuasive those circumstances under which the \n5  materiality of omitted information is an issue of law. See Chism v. Washington State, 661 \n6  F.3d 380, 389 (9th Cir. 2011) (noting the “inquiry into whether the false statements and \n7  omissions [in an affidavit for a search warrant application] were material is a purely legal \n8  question . . . . [and] were material if ‘the affidavit, once corrected and supplemented,’ \n9  would not have provided a magistrate judge with a substantial basis for finding probable \n10  cause” (citation omitted)); S.E.C. v. Reys, 712 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1177 (W.D. Wash. \n11  2010) (noting that, in the shareholder context, the materiality of an omission is an issue of \n12  law “[o]nly when the disclosures or omissions are so clearly unimportant that reasonable \n13  minds could not differ” (quoting In re Craftmatic Sec. Litig., 890 F.2d 628, 641 (3d Cir. \n14  1989))). The materiality of an applicant’s failure to complete the checkbox on the State \n15  Form or Federal Form is a question of law.  \n16  a.  The Checkbox Requirement With DPOC \n17  The United States contends that an incomplete checkbox on a voter registration \n18  form is immaterial when an applicant provides the State with DPOC. (USA Mot. at 21.) \n19  The State cites Diaz v. Cobb, 435 F. Supp. 2d 1206 (S.D. Fla. 2006), as “the most \n20  analogous case” to the Checkbox Requirement in asserting that it does not violate the \n21  Materiality Provision. (State Reply at 31; see State Mot. at 11–13.) The plaintiffs in Diaz \n22  argued that a voting law violated the Materiality Provision by requiring applicants to (1) \n23  check boxes affirming that they are citizens, have not been convicted of a felony, and \n24  have not been adjudicated mentally incompetent, and (2) sign an oath affirming, inter \n25  alia, that they are “qualified to register as an elector under the Constitution and laws of \n26  the State of Florida.” 435 F. Supp. 2d at 1212–13. The Diaz court held that checking the \n27  boxes was not “duplicative” of signing the oath because the oath did not require an \n28  applicant to specifically affirm her citizenship, and even if it were duplicative, material \n \n- 24 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 25 of 35\n \n \n \n1  information does not “become[] immaterial due solely to its repetition.” Id. at 1212–13. \n2  Though an applicant registering for Arizona elections must similarly affirm her \n3  citizenship both by specifically marking “yes” in the checkbox and signing an oath, Diaz \n4  is inapposite, as an applicant must also  provide  DPOC. A.R.S.  § 16-121.01(A), (C). \n5  Instead,  the  Court  finds  the  reasoning  in  League  of  Women  Voters  of  Arkansas  v. \n6  Thurston, No. 5:20-cv-05174, 2021 WL 5312640 (W.D. Ark., Nov. 15, 2021), more \n7  persuasive. There, the court found that plaintiffs stated a claim that a voting law violated \n8  the Materiality Provision because it required absentee voters to provide information about \n9  their eligibility to vote “several times,” and voters “correctly provided that information at \n10  least once,” but had their ballots “rejected on the basis of a mismatch or omission in one \n11  of the multiple documents they ha[d] provided.”  2021 WL 5312640, at *4. The Voting \n12  Laws similarly permit Arizona to reject an applicant’s registration based on a “mismatch” \n13  between  documents,  specifically  an  incomplete  checkbox  on  a  registration  form \n14  notwithstanding  the  applicant’s  accompanying  documentary  proof  of  citizenship.  See \n15  § 16-121.01(A), (C).  \n16  The State contends that the checkbox is still “useful” in determining an applicant’s \n17  citizenship.15  Materiality  “signifies  different  degrees  of  importance  in  different  legal \n18  contexts.” Fla. State Conf. of N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1173 (11th Cir. \n19  2008).  The  Eleventh  Circuit  observed  in  Browning  that  if  “material”  under  the \n20  Materiality Provision “means minimal relevance,” then an error is material if it “tends to \n21  make it more likely that the applicant is not a qualified voter than” in the absence of the \n22  error.  Id.  at  1174.  The  Browning  court  cited  to  the  “criminal  mail  and  wire  fraud \n23  context,” where “a false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence, or \n24  is  capable  of  influencing,  the  decision  of  the  decisionmaking  body  to  which  it  was \n25  addressed.” Id. at 1173 (quoting United States v. Gray, 367 F.3d 1263, 1272 n.19 (11th \n26 \n \n15  The  State  also  argues  more  generally  that  “[t]he  [checkbox]  is  ‘material  in \n27 \ndetermining’ the voter’s eligibility because U.S. citizenship is a requirement for voting in \nArizona.” (State Mot. at 12 (internal citations omitted).) But this conclusory argument \n28 \nconflates materiality of an applicant’s citizenship with the materiality of an incomplete \ncheckbox in determining an applicant’s citizenship. (See USA Mot. at 18.) \n \n- 25 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 26 of 35\n \n \n \n1  Cir. 2004)). However, “‘capable of influencing’ is an objective test, which looks at ‘the \n2  intrinsic capabilities of the false statement itself, rather than the possibility of the actual \n3  attainment of its end.’” United States v. Peterson, 538 F.3d 1064, 1072 (9th Cir. 2008). \n4  The Court does not accept that information must only meet such a low bar to be material. \n5  Because Arizona may not deny an individual the right to vote due to an error or omission \n6  that “is not material in determining” her eligibility to vote, the Court infers that Congress \n7  intended16  materiality  to  require  some  probability  of  actually  impacting  an  election \n8  official’s eligibility determination.17 § 10101(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added); c.f. TSC Indus., \n9  Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976) (explaining that under the Securities \n10  Exchange  Act,  an  omission  is  material  if  there  is  a  “substantial  likelihood  that  the \n11  disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as \n12  having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available”); United States \n13  v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985) (in criminal procedure, exculpatory “evidence is \n14  material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to \n15  the  defense,  the  result  of  the  proceeding  would  have  been  different.  A  ‘reasonable \n16  probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine the confidence in the outcome”); \n17  Bruton v. Massanari, 268 F.3d 824, 827 (9th Cir. 2001) (in social security benefits cases, \n18  “new evidence is material . . . if there is a reasonable possibility that the new evidence \n19  would have changed the outcome of the determination” (citation and internal quotation \n \n20  16 “Where Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under either equity \nor  the  common  law,  a  court  must  infer,  unless  the  statute  otherwise  dictates,  that \n21 \nCongress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.” Kungys v. United \nStates, 485 U.S. 759, 770 (1988) (citation omitted) (applying meaning of materiality of \n22 \nfalse statements to public officials to the denaturalization context).  \n17 At least one court has interpreted “material” to mean something akin to necessary. See \n23 \nLa Unión del Pueblo Entero v. Abbott, 604 F. Supp. 3d 512, 542 (W.D. Tex. 2022) \n(plaintiffs  plausibly  alleged  that  a  voting  law  “may  require  information  that  is \n24 \nunnecessary and therefore not material to determining an individual’s qualifications to \nvote  under  Texas  law”  (internal  citations  omitted)  (emphasis  added)).  Whatever  the \n25 \nappropriate  definition  of  “material”  in  this  context,  it  means  something  more  than \n“useful” or “minimal[ly] relevan[t].” (See USA Mot. at 18); compare Material, Black’s \n26 \nLaw Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (“Having some logical connection with the consequential \nfacts” or being “[o]f such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person’s \n27 \ndecision-making;  significant;  essential”),  with  Relevant,  Black’s  Law  Dictionary \n(“Logically  connected  and  tending  to  prove  or  disprove  a  matter  in  issue;  having \n28 \nappreciable  probative  value—that  is,  rationally  tending  to  persuade  people  of  the \nprobability or possibility of some alleged fact”). \n \n- 26 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 27 of 35\n \n \n \n1  marks omitted) (cleaned up))).  \n2  The State asserts that “if a prospective voter is presented with a clear yes-or-no \n3  question about whether the voter is a citizen and does not mark ‘Yes,’ that information is \n4  material.”  (State  Reply  at  30.)  The  State  cites  Browning,  which  interpreted  the \n5  Materiality Provision as “ask[ing] whether, accepting the error as true and correct, the \n6  information  contained  in  the  error  is  material  to  determining  the  eligibility  of  the \n7  applicant.” 522 F.3d at 1175 (emphasis in original). The Browning court explained that \n8  with additional and accurate information:  \n9  [an] election official will always be able to verify identity of the applicant. \nIt is this additional information exclusively—and not the degree to which \n10  that  new  information  deviates  from  the  information  on  the  registration \napplication form, or the “nature of the error”—that enables the election \n11  official to ascertain the identity of the voter. \n12  Id. at 1175 n.23 (emphasis in original). This suggests that no error could be material \n13  unless  the  erroneous  information  were  considered  in  isolation  from  other  additional \n14  information probative of an applicant’s eligibility to vote. But the materiality of an error \n15  or omission is determined by the other information available to the State. So when an \n16  applicant  includes  DPOC,  it  makes  little  sense  to  accept  an  incomplete  citizenship \n17  checkbox on her registration form as “true and correct” when it is clearly not, and that \n18  incomplete checkbox should not alter any determination of her eligibility to vote. C.f. \n19  TSC  Indus.,  426  U.S.  at  449  (focusing  on  “the  ‘total  mix’  of  information  made \n20  available”). Applying Browning’s interpretation of materiality would allow Arizona to \n21  disregard documentation that, under Arizona law, constitutes “satisfactory evidence of \n22  citizenship” and disenfranchise eligible voters. A.R.S.  § 16-166(F) (emphasis added). \n23  The  Checkbox  Requirement  violates  the  Materiality  Provision  when  an  applicant \n24  provides satisfactory evidence of citizenship.   \n25  b.  The Checkbox Requirement Without DPOC  \n26  As discussed above, the State must register both State Form and Federal Form \n27  users for federal elections without requiring DPOC. (Supra Part II.A.) The Checkbox \n28  Requirement  as  applied  to  these  voters  does  not  violate  the  Materiality  Provision. \n \n- 27 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 28 of 35\n \n \n \n1  Specifically, the Federal Form “may require only such [information] as is necessary to \n2  enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant and \n3  to  administer  voter  registration  and  other  parts  of  the  election  process.”  52  U.S.C. \n4  § 20508(b)(1); see id. § 20505(a)(1). Congress further specified that the Federal Form \n5  “shall include,” inter alia, a checkbox for the applicant to indicate whether she is a \n6  citizen and requires that an applicant who fails to check the box be given “an opportunity \n7  to complete the form” before the next federal election. Id. § 21083(b)(4)(A)(i), (B); (see \n8  State Mot. at 12; State Reply at 29.) This statutory scheme indicates that the checkbox is \n9  “necessary” to determine an applicant’s eligibility, and it is doubtful “that Congress \n10  would  mandate  the  gathering  of  information  .  .  .  that  it  also  deems  immaterial.”  \n11  Browning, 522 F.3d at 1174. \n12    The Court also agrees with the State that even assuming the checkbox on the \n13  Federal Form is duplicative of the oath, an applicant’s failure to complete the checkbox is \n14  not an immaterial omission. (State Reply at 29 (citing Diaz, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 1213); see \n15  Federal Form at 26 (requiring applicant to affirm “under penalty of perjury and threat of \n16  deportation” that she is a United States citizen).) Though an applicant must affirm her \n17  citizenship  twice,  it  is  effectively  an  applicant’s  only  opportunity  to  provide  this \n18  information when registering for federal elections. See League of Women Voters of Ark., \n19  2021 WL 5312640, at *4 (indicating that it would not violate the Materiality Provision to \n20  reject  a  ballot  due  to  an  error  or  omission  “[w]here  absentee  voters  have  only  one \n21  opportunity to provide information” about their qualifications to vote). As for State Form \n22  users, they must specifically affirm their citizenship only once, and the United States \n23  concedes that the Checkbox Requirement on the State Form is permissible in the absence \n24  of DPOC.18 (USA Mot. at 21; State Form.) The Checkbox Requirement does not violate \n25 \n \n26  18 Unlike the checkbox and the signature box on the Federal Form, which both inquire \nspecifically into whether an applicant is a citizen, the oath on the State Form requires an \n27 \napplicant to affirm that the information in the registration is true, that she is a resident of \nArizona, and has not been convicted of a felony or adjudged incapacitated. (See Federal \n28 \nForm at 26; State Form at 51.) The checkbox on the State Form is not duplicative of this \n“general” oath. See Diaz, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 1213.  \n \n- 28 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 29 of 35\n \n \n \n1  the Materiality Provision as applied to individuals who do not provide DPOC.19 \n2    2.  The Birthplace Requirement \n3    The State argues that the Birthplace Requirement does not violate the Materiality \n4  Provision because an applicant’s place of birth “can help confirm [a] voter’s identity.” \n5  (State Mot. at 14 (noting that “verifying an individual’s identity is a material requirement \n6  of voting” (quoting Ind. Democratic Party v. Rokita, 458 F. Supp. 2d 775, 841 (S.D. Ind. \n7  2006))).) The Court agrees with the United States that there is a dispute of material fact \n8  about whether an applicant’s failure to include her birthplace is material in determining \n9  her  eligibility  to  vote.  (See  USA  Mot.  at  21–23.)  The  State  cites  the  United  States \n10  Department of State’s Foreign Affairs Manual, which requires passport applicants to \n11  provide  their  birthplace  because  birthplace  is  an  “integral  part  of  establishing  an \n12  individual’s identity.” (State Mot. at 14 (quoting Doc. 365-1, Ex. H, at 107).) But as the \n13  State recognizes, it began offering voters the option to include their “state or country of \n14  birth” in 1979, and there is no indication that this information—or lack thereof—has ever \n15  been material in determining an applicant’s eligibility to vote. (State Mot. at 13 (citing \n16  Doc. 365-1, Ex. G, A.R.S § 16-152(A) (1979)).)  \n17  The State argues that how election officials use a person’s birthplace is beside the \n18  point  because  “[t]he  question  is  whether  a  person’s  state  or  country  of  birth  is, \n19  objectively, ‘material to determining the eligibility of the applicant.’” (State Reply at 33 \n20  (quoting  Browning,  522  F.3d  at  1175).)  The  State  also  contends  that  “[w]hether \n21  [birthplace]  is  material  in  determining  voter  eligibility  depends  on  its  relevance  to \n22  eligibility.”  Id.  But  if,  as  the  State  argues,  a  person’s  state  or  country  of  birth  is \n23  “objectively relevant” to a person’s identity, so too are her father’s and mother’s names, \n24  or her occupation. (See State Form at 51 (providing applicants the option to include \n25  occupation  and  parents’  names).)  Whether  the  Birthplace  Requirement  violates  the \n26  Materiality Provision is an issue of fact inappropriate for summary judgment. \n27 \n \n19 Mi Familia Vota’s Cross-Motion on the materiality of the Checkbox Requirement is \n28 \nmoot. The Court need not address the parties’ arguments regarding Private Plaintiffs’ \nstanding. (See, e.g., RNC Mot. at 11–15.) \n \n- 29 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 30 of 35\n \n \n \n1  C.  Vagueness of the Purge Provisions \n2  The State seeks summary judgment on Promise Arizona’s claims that the purge \n3  provisions of the Voting Laws, A.R.S. § 16-165(a)(10) and (I), are void for vagueness \n4  because they do “not provide an election official any guidance to determine whether a \n5  person is not a United States citizen” and allow the Attorney General to open a criminal \n6  investigation into any person whose voter registration is cancelled. (Doc. 1, 22-cv-1602, \n7  Compl. ¶ 139; State Mot. at 15–16.) Specifically, the State contends that the void-for-\n8  vagueness  doctrine  is  inapplicable  because  the  Voting  Laws  do  not  regulate  voter \n9  conduct, and that even if the doctrine does apply, the purge provisions are not vague. \n10  (State Mot. at 15–16; State Reply at 39–42.)  \n11  “The void-for-vagueness doctrine . . . guarantees that ordinary people have ‘fair \n12  notice’ of the conduct a statute proscribes.” Sessions v.

Promise Arizona attempts to frame § 16-165 as a penal statute and asserts that “in \n14  order to avoid the punishment of being compared with the [Systematic Alien Verification \n15  for Entitlements] program, and subsequently, voter registration cancellation and criminal \n16  investigation, the voter is prohibited from giving county recorders any reason to believe \n17  that they are not a United States citizen.” (Promise Arizona Resp. at 4–5 (emphasis in \n18  original).) A penal law must “provide a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is \n19  prohibited,”  or  be  sufficiently  definite  as  to  not  “allow  arbitrary  and  discriminatory \n20  enforcement.” Human Life of Wash. Inc. v. Brumsickle, 624 F.3d 990, 1019 (9th Cir. \n21  2010) (citation omitted); see City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999). As the \n22  Voting Laws are not penal in nature and do not address individual conduct, the Court will \n23  grant the State’s Motion on this claim. \n24  First, § 16-165(I) is not penal, as “[i]t does not define the elements of an offense, \n25  fix any mandatory penalty, or threaten people with punishment if they violate its terms.” \n26  United States v. Christie, 825 F.3d 1048, 1064–65 (9th Cir. 2016); (see State Reply at \n27  40). Because the provision “is not a penal statute or anything like one,” it cannot be \n28  unconstitutionally vague. Christie, 825 F.3d at 1064 (“Justice Thomas, in his history of \n \n- 30 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 31 of 35\n \n \n \n1  the void-for-vagueness doctrine, cites one case in which the Supreme Court voided a \n2  vague statute that he classifies as non-penal.” Id. at 1064 n.5 (citing Johnson v. United \n3  States, 576 U.S. 591, 612 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment))).  \n4  Second, § 16-165(I) regulates county recorders, not registered voters. (State Reply \n5  at  39.)  If  a  law  “imposes  neither  regulation  of  nor  sanction  for  conduct,”  then  “no \n6  necessity exists for guidance so that one may avoid the applicability of the law.” Boutilier \n7  v. INS, 387 U.S. 118, 123 (1967) (emphasis added). The void-for-vagueness doctrine is \n8  inapplicable to the fact of whether a voter is a citizen. See Martinez-de Ryan v. Whitaker, \n9  909 F.3d 247, 251 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Boutilier to distinguish between conduct and a \n10  “status or condition”); c.f. Soules v. Kauaians for Nukolii Campaign Comm., 849 F.2d \n11  1176,  1184  (9th  Cir.  1988)  (rejecting  argument  that  a  county  charter’s  grant  of \n12  “unbounded discretion to schedule special elections in ‘appropriate circumstances’” was \n13  void for vagueness because “Appellants are not at risk of being punished for engaging in \n14  ill-defined proscribed conduct” (emphasis added)). And a statute “is not vague because it \n15  may at times be difficult to prove [a] . . . fact but rather because it is unclear as to what \n16  fact must be proved.” F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012) \n17  (citing United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 306 (2008)); c.f. Kay v. Mills, 490 F. \n18  Supp. 844, 850–52 (E.D. Ky. 1980) (finding statute void for vagueness because it did not \n19  notify a presidential candidate of what it meant to be “generally advocated and nationally \n20  recognized”  in  order  to  be  placed  on  the  preferential  primary  ballot).  The  void-for-\n21  vagueness doctrine is inapplicable, as the Voting Laws clearly require county recorders to \n22  investigate a registered voter’s citizenship status.20  \n23  Promise  Arizona’s  void-for-vagueness  argument  about  § 16-165(A)  fails  for \n24  similar reasons. The county recorder must cancel a voter’s registration and refer the \n \n25  20 Even if the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies, § 16-165(I) is not unconstitutionally \nvague. The “reason to believe” standard in § 16-165(I) is not “so indefinite as to allow \n26 \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,” but is common in statutory drafting. See, e.g., \n15 U.S.C. § 56(b) (“Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any person, \n27 \npartnership, or corporation is liable for a criminal penalty under this subchapter, the \nCommission shall certify the facts to the Attorney General . . . .”); 25 U.S.C. § 3206 \n28 \n(permitting examinations and interviews of children whom law enforcement officials \n“have reason to believe” were abused). \n \n- 31 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 32 of 35\n \n \n \n1  matter for investigation only after (1) the county recorder “confirms”21 that the voter is \n2  not  a  citizen,  (2)  the  county  recorder  notifies  the  voter  that  her  registration  will  be \n3  cancelled in 35 days unless the voter provides DPOC, and (3) the voter fails to provide \n4  DPOC. § 16-165(A)(10). The first two requirements do not regulate or sanction a voter’s \n5  conduct,  while  the  third  unambiguously  informs  voters  that  they  must  confirm  their \n6  citizenship status within 35 days to avoid being de-registered and referred for criminal \n7  investigation.22 (See State Reply at 39 (arguing § 16-165 regulates county recorders)); \n8  Boutilier, 387 U.S. at 123.  \n9  The Court grants the State’s Motion on Promise Arizona’s void-for-vagueness \n10  claim. \n11  III.   CONCLUSION  \n12    The  NVRA  was  designed  to  enhance  eligible  voter  participation  in  federal \n13  elections  and  lawfully  regulates  presidential  elections.  The  Court  finds  Section  6 \n14  preempts H.B. 2492’s restrictions on presidential elections and mail-in voting. The Court \n15  also concludes that H.B. 2243’s systematic removal provisions violate the NVRA’s 90-\n16  day Provision. The Court also finds that the Voting Laws’ purge provisions are not \n17  unconstitutionally vague, yet there remain genuine issues of material fact as to whether \n18  the purge provisions violate the Civil Rights Act or enable Arizona to contravene Section \n19  8.  Lastly,  the  Court  finds  that  the  LULAC  Consent  Decree  precludes  Arizona  from \n20  enforcing H.B. 2492’s mandate to reject any State Form without accompanying DPOC.  \n21    The Checkbox Requirement does not violate the Materiality Provision as applied \n22  to individuals who submit a registration without DPOC. But the Court finds that Arizona \n23 \n \n21 Promise Arizona argues that § 16-165(A)(10) does not specify when a county recorder \n24 \n“‘confirms’, i.e., believes, that a registered voter is not a U.S. citizen.” (Promise Arizona \nResp. at 6.) But the provision clearly sets forth the sources of information that may \n25 \nconfirm a registrant’s non-citizenship.   \n22  Promise  Arizona’s  argument  that  these  provisions  empower  county  recorders  to \n26 \n“decide” when to subject voters to “criminal liability” is unpersuasive. (Promise Arizona \nResp.  at  5.)  County  recorders  only  notify  the  attorney  general  of  cancelled  voter \n27 \nregistrations for “possible investigation.” § 16-165(A)(10) (emphasis added). It is the \nattorney general who investigates and must subsequently “prosecute individuals who are \n28 \nfound not to be United States citizens” and who registered to vote “knowing” that they \nare “not entitled to such registration.” See A.R.S. §§ 16-143(D), 16-182(A).  \n \n- 32 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 534   Filed 09/14/23   Page 33 of 35\n \n \n \n1  may not reject a voter registration that does not contain a checkmark in the box next to \n2  the question regarding citizenship when the person provides DPOC and is otherwise \n3  eligible to vote.

In  support,  Plaintiff  alleges  the \n55  \nfollowing: \n66  \nNATURE OF THE CASE \n77  \n1.  This  is  an  action  brought  under  the  U.S.  Constitution  to  safeguard  the \n88  \nfundamental rights of hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, including the right to vote and \n99  \nthe state-protected right to vote early by mail, which are subject to due process protections. \n1100  \n“No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of \n1111  \nthose who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even \n1122  \nthe most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 \n1133  \nU.S. 1, 17 (1964). In this action, Plaintiff challenges Arizona’s latest effort to undermine \n1144  \nthat most precious right: the recently enacted H.B. 2492, which severely burdens the right \n1155   to vote and, in many cases, will deny that right entirely, disenfranchising eligible, lawful \n1166   voters in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n1177   2.  Arizona has a long and complex history of applying different registration and \n1188   voting requirements to different voters, which has caused portions of its law to be held in \nviolation of federal law and has required the State to enter into an ongoing consent decree. \n1199  \nSee Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 15 (2013); Consent Decree \n2200  \nat  7-16,  LULAC  v.  Reagan,  No.  2:17-cv-04102-DGC  (June  18,  2018),  ECF  No.  37 \n2211  \n(“Consent Decree”). The result is a byzantine system in which Arizona has three classes of \n2222  \nvoters: (1) those who registered pre-2005 and did not have to show documentary proof of \n2233  \ncitizenship (because Arizona did not yet require it), who can vote in all elections; (2) those \n2244  \nwho  registered  post-2005  using  the  federal  form  required  by  the  National  Voter \n2255  \nRegistration Act (“NVRA”) (the “Federal Form”) and did not show documentary proof of \n2266  \ncitizenship, who can vote only in federal elections; and (3) those who registered post-2005 \n2277  \nand showed adequate proof of citizenship, who can vote in all elections. All of these voters \n2288  \nare entitled to vote in elections for which they are qualified by mail, a right which Arizona \n  \n-1- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 4 of 22\n \n11   has provided to all voters for any reason since 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. Further, under \n22   the ongoing consent decree, the state must (1) treat all registrants the same regardless of \n33   whether they use the state form or Federal Form, registering all voters for federal elections \n44   regardless of provided evidence of citizenship; and (2) check the motor vehicles database \nfor citizenship documentation before limiting voters to federal-only elections. See Consent \n55  \nDecree at 7-16. \n66  \n3.  H.B. 2492 (the “Proof of Citizenship Restriction”), which was signed into \n77  \nlaw on March 30, 2022, adds another confusing, discriminatory, and unconstitutional \n88  \nimpediment to this morass. Among other things, the Restriction will require new registrants \n99  \nusing the Federal Form to provide additional documentation if they want to vote in \n1100  \npresidential  elections  or  vote  early  by  mail  for  any  office,  prohibit  those  currently \n1111  \nregistered using the Federal Form who registered without proof of citizenship from voting \n1122  \nby mail or in presidential elections, and require long-registered Arizonans who never had \n1133  \nto provide proof of citizenship—estimated to be close to 200,000 voters1—to locate and \n1144  \npresent additional documentation to vote in presidential elections. The law provides no \n1155   details concerning how long-registered voters will be notified that they must provide new \n1166   documents, or how they will be given an opportunity to do so, and also requires the \n1177   Attorney General to investigate and potentially prosecute voters who registered without \n1188   providing proof of citizenship. \n4.  The  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  continues  a  baseless  assault  on \n1199  \nArizona’s election system based on a conspiracy theory that non-citizens are voting, despite \n2200  \na persistent lack of credible evidence to support such claims. The Restriction is the newest \n2211  \nin a series of cynical and bad faith attempts to use these politically motivated and false \n2222  \nallegations to limit access to voting by eligible, lawful citizens. And the new law’s \n2233  \nlimitations on early voting are particularly pernicious given the prevalence of early voting \n2244  \nby mail in Arizona. In 2020, a record-setting 88 percent of voters used Arizona’s early \n2255  \n2266    \n1 See Laurie Roberts, Republicans want HOW MANY Arizonans to prove they have a right \n2277  \nto  vote?,  The  Ariz.

But, even before the pandemic, early voting was \n22   the most common form of voting in the state. In 2016, over 2 million Arizona voters—or \n33   about 75 percent of those who participated in the election—used early voting. Even in \n44   2008, more than a million voters—or close to half of those participating—used early \nvoting. And, as more voters have turned to early voting by mail, Arizona’s election \n55  \nadministrators have responded by diverting their resources to support mail-in voting, \n66  \nanticipating that the overwhelming majority of Arizona voters will exercise their right to \n77  \nvote by mail. As a result, in-person voting facilities and opportunities have dramatically \n88  \ndecreased.  \n99  \n5.  In other words, for decades Arizona’s voting system has been oriented \n1100  \ntoward  supporting  and  facilitating  early  mail  voters.  It  was  well-tested  and  well-\n1111  \nestablished. There is no evidence that it was undermined or even vulnerable to abuse or \n1122  \nfraud. Quite to the contrary, both Governor Doug Ducey and Secretary Hobbs have \n1133  \nrepeatedly assured the public and the nation that false claims about the legitimacy of \n1144  \nArizona’s 2020 election are to be rejected, that the election was secure and fraud-free, and \n1155   that the results should be trusted. As Governor Ducey emphasized in response to attacks \n1166   on the integrity of the 2020 election: “We’ve been doing early voting since 1992,” and \n1177   claims about problems with the system or the election are unfounded.2 Despite these \n1188   assurances,  multiple  lawsuits  and  contests  brought  by  the  Republican  Party,  former \nPresident Donald Trump’s campaign, and their supporters have sought to cast doubt on the \n1199  \noutcome of the 2020 election. Arizona’s state and federal courts responded by rejecting \n2200  \nthose suits and repudiated their champions for their striking lack of evidence. For example, \n2211  \nin a case brought by the Arizona Republican Party to challenge the legitimacy of Maricopa \n2222  \nCounty’s audit, the Superior Court ordered the party to pay attorney’s fees to the Secretary \n2233  \nof State under A.R.S. § 12-349 because the lawsuit was “groundless,” brought in “bad \n2244  \nfaith,” and served only to “cast false shadows on the election’s legitimacy.” Order at 9-10, \n2255  \nAriz.

The same false narratives sowed the groundwork for the Proof of Citizenship \n2277  \n \n2 @DougDucey, Twitter (Nov. 30, 2020, 9:48 PM) \n2288  \nhttps://twitter.com/dougducey/status/1333603891863191552? ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw. \n  \n-3- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 6 of 22\n \n11   Restriction, and now, as a result, tens of thousands of Arizonans will be forced to jump \n22   through unnecessary hoops to access the mail voting system upon which they have come \n33   to rely, and to vote in presidential elections whether by mail or in person. Some of those \n44   lawful,  eligible  Arizona  voters  will  be  unable  to  clear  the  Restriction’s  hurdles.  As \nmanifested by state officials’ full-throated defense of Arizona’s election system in the \n55  \nimmediate aftermath of the November 2020 election, as well as multiple court decisions \n66  \nrelated to the same, there are no state interests, much less compelling ones, to justify the \n77  \nnew imposition of these unjustifiable and disparate burdens. There is no evidence that any \n88  \nof Arizona’s voting methods are beset by fraud, and no credible evidence that non-citizens \n99  \nare attempting to overcome (much less actually overcoming) the numerous safeguards \n1100  \nArizona has put in place to limit voting in Arizona to United States citizens. The Proof of \n1111  \nCitizenship Restriction is an entirely illegitimate and unconstitutional roadblock erected in \n1122  \nthe path of lawful, eligible voters. For these reasons and those detailed below, Plaintiff \n1133  \nrespectfully  requests  a  declaration  that  the  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  is \n1144  \nunconstitutional and an order enjoining its enforcement. \n1155   JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1166   7.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 to redress \n1177   the deprivation, under the color of state law, of their rights under the First and Fourteenth \n1188   Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s claims pursuant \n1199  \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1357. \n2200  \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Secretary of State, as she is sued in her \n2211  \nofficial capacity as an elected official in Arizona. Further, the Secretary works and resides \n2222  \nin the State of Arizona.  \n2233  \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Attorney General, as he is sued in his \n2244  \nofficial capacity as an elected official in Arizona. Further, the Attorney General works and \n2255  \nresides in the State of Arizona. \n2266  \n11.

Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \n22   events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district and in this \n33   division. \n44   13.

Plaintiff Mi Familia Vota (“MFV”) is a national, non-profit civic engagement \n99  \norganization with a mission of uniting Latino, immigrant, and allied communities to \n1100  \npromote social and economic justice through increased civic participation by encouraging \n1111  \nleadership development, citizenship, and issue organizing. MFV encourages non-partisan \n1122  \nvoter registration and voter participation and has challenged voter suppression around the \n1133  \nnation. See, e.g., Mi Familia Vota v. Hobbs, No: 2:21-cv-01423-DWL (D. Ariz. filed Aug. \n1144  \n17, 2021); Mi Familia Vota v. Abbott, 497 F. Supp. 3d 195 (W.D. Tex. 2020). It has \n1155   operations in six states, including Arizona, where it is headquartered. More than 14,000 \n1166   Arizonans follow and engage with MFV via email and/or MFV’s social media platforms. \n1177   15.  In advance of the 2020 election, MFV organized voter registration drives and \n1188   conducted get-out-the-vote activities. MFV helped countless Arizonans register to vote \nusing a Federal Form and helped countless Arizonans register to vote by mail. MFV also \n1199  \nconducted  voter  education  campaigns  and  provided  other  voter  assistance,  including \n2200  \ndriving voters to polling locations.  \n2211  \n16.  MFV plans to organize the same activities for future elections. As a result of \n2222  \nthe Proof of Citizenship Restriction, however, MFV must divert money, personnel, time, \n2233  \nand resources away from other programming in order to dedicate more resources toward \n2244  \nefforts  to  ensure  that  voters  can  navigate  the  restrictions  imposed  by  the  Proof  of \n2255  \nCitizenship Restriction. Additionally, MFV plans to hire additional staff to help educate \n2266  \nvoters about the Proof of Citizenship Restriction and is considering developing public \n2277  \nservice announcements in Spanish-language media concerning the changes. MFV will also \n2288  \nexpend resources confirming that voters who previously registered to vote either (1) pre-\n  \n-5- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 8 of 22\n \n11   2005 or (2) post-2005 using the Federal Form, are not prohibited from voting early by mail \n22   or in presidential elections due to the Proof of Citizenship Restriction.   \n33   17.  Defendant Katie Hobbs is the Secretary of State of Arizona and is the Chief \n44   Elections Officer for Arizona. Ariz. Const. art. V, § 9; A.R.S. § 16-142. As Arizona’s Chief \nElections Officer, the Secretary is responsible for carrying out the state’s election laws and \n55  \noverseeing the voting process—and is empowered with broad authority to carry out that \n66  \nresponsibility. As such, the Secretary has the authority to promulgate rules and procedures \n77  \nfor elections, including rules and regulations pertaining to voter registration. A.R.S. §§ 16-\n88  \n452, 16-168(J). Moreover, the Secretary is charged with enforcing the new statutory \n99  \nprovisions at issue here. A.R.S. § 16-143. The Secretary is sued in her official capacity for \n1100  \nactions taken under color of state law. \n1111  \n18.  Defendant Mark Brnovich is the Attorney General of Arizona and the State’s \n1122  \nchief  legal  officer.  A.R.S. § 41-192.  The  Attorney  General  is  authorized  to  enforce \n1133  \nArizona’s election laws in “any election for state office, members of the legislature, justices \n1144  \nof the supreme court, judges of the court of appeals or statewide initiative or referendum \n1155   . . . through civil and criminal actions.” A.R.S. § 16-1021. Moreover, the Attorney General \n1166   is charged with enforcing the new statutory provisions at issue here. A.R.S. § 16-143. The \n1177   Attorney General is sued in his official capacity for actions taken under color of state law.   \n1188   19.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction makes county recorders responsible for \nimplementing  and  enforcing  the  statutory  provisions  at  issue  here.  Amongst  other \n1199  \nresponsibilities, county recorders are charged with verifying a voter’s citizenship status, \n2200  \nrejecting  voter  registration  applications  if  the  county  recorder  cannot  confirm  an \n2211  \napplicant’s  citizenship  status,  forwarding  applications  to  the  Attorney  General  for \n2222  \ninvestigation, and canceling a voter’s registration based on citizenship.

Arizona has a long and tortured history of changing voter registration \n1133   systems. \n1144   35.  Despite the lack of any credible fraud allegations, there has been a decades-\n1155   long effort in Arizona—as the state’s electorate has become more diverse—to restrict the \n1166   franchise and impose unjustifiable impediments to the right to vote. These changes have \nled to disenfranchisement, multiple conflicting systems, and repeated litigation.  \n1177  \n36.  As is particularly relevant here, in 2004 Arizona voters adopted Proposition \n1188  \n200, a ballot initiative purportedly designed “to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to \n1199  \npresent proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to present identification when \n2200  \nthey vote on election day.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 2 (2006) (per curiam). \n2211  \nProposition 200 amended the state’s election code to require county recorders to “reject \n2222  \nany application for registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United \n2233  \nStates citizenship.” A.R.S. § 16–166(F). This requirement was seemingly in direct conflict \n2244  \nwith the NVRA, which requires states to “accept and use” a standard federal registration \n2255  \nform for voter registration (the “Federal Form”) that does not require applicants to provide \n2266  \ndocumentary proof of citizenship. 52 U.S.C. § 20505. And, in fact, the Supreme Court held \n2277   in 2013 that the NVRA precluded Arizona from requiring applicants who used the NVRA’s \n2288   Federal Form to submit information beyond that required by the form itself. Inter Tribal \n  \n-7- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 10 of 22\n \n11   Council of Ariz., 570 U.S. at 15 (“We conclude that . . . a state-imposed requirement of \n22   evidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is ‘inconsistent with’ the NVRA’s \n33   mandate that States ‘accept and use’ the Federal Form.” (quoting Ex parte Siebold, 100 \n44   U.S. 371, 397 (1880))).   \n37.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Inter Tribal Council left open the \n55  \npossibility of imposing different requirements for voters in state and local elections than \n66  \nfederal elections. Then-Attorney General Thomas Horne issued an Opinion on October 7, \n77  \n2013 stating that such a system was required to comply with both state law and the NVRA, \n88  \nsee  Ariz.  Att’y  Gen.  Op.  No.  I13-011  (Oct.  7,  2013),  available  at \n99  \nhttps://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2018-06/I13-011.pdf (last visited Mar. 30, 2022), \n1100  \nand then-Secretary of State Ken Bennett subsequently implemented Arizona’s bifurcated \n1111  \nvoter registration system, which has been in place ever since.  \n1122  \n38.  Under this bifurcated system, Arizona has three classes of voters: (1) those \n1133  \nwho registered pre-2005 and did not have to show proof of citizenship, who have been \n1144  \npermitted to vote in all elections; (2) those who registered post-2005 using the Federal \n1155   Form and did not show evidence of citizenship, who have been permitted to vote only in \n1166   federal elections; and (3) those who registered post-2005 and showed adequate proof of \n1177   citizenship, who have been permitted to vote in all elections. All of these voters were \n1188   entitled to vote in elections for which they were qualified by mail, a right which Arizona \nhas provided to all voters for any reason since 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. \n1199  \n39.  This bifurcated system has already led to disenfranchisement and confusion, \n2200  \nresulting in further litigation. For example, prior to 2018, voters who used Arizona’s state \n2211  \nregistration form and provided no evidence of citizenship were not registered to vote in \n2222  \nany elections, while voters who undertook the same process but used the Federal Form to \n2233  \nregister were registered to vote in federal elections. See generally Consent Decree. What’s \n2244  \nmore, because Arizona has documentary proof of citizenship for some citizens from their \n2255  \ndriver’s license application, some citizens who register to vote with the Federal Form have \n2266  \nalready provided proof of citizenship in a means that is easily verifiable, and the state can \n2277  \neasily search for such voters’ documentation and allow them to vote in all elections. Id. \n2288  \n40.  Due to these issues, in 2017, the League of United Latin American Citizens \n  \n-8- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 11 of 22\n \n11   Arizona and the Arizona Students’ Association sued then-Secretary of State Michele \n22   Reagan and then-Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, alleging that the state’s dual \n33   voter registration policies constituted an undue burden on the right to vote and that the \n44   state’s failure to register voters who used the state form without providing proof of \ncitizenship in federal elections had disenfranchised “at least 26,000 otherwise eligible \n55  \nvoters . . . in Maricopa County alone.” Compl. ¶¶ 39, 77-88, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-\n66  \ncv-04102-DGC (Nov. 7, 2017), ECF No. 1. The parties entered into a consent decree to \n77  \nend the litigation, which required (1) Arizona to treat all registrants the same regardless of \n88  \nwhether they use the state form or Federal Form, registering all voters for federal elections; \n99  \nand (2) state and county officials to check the motor vehicles database for citizenship \n1100  \ndocumentation before limiting voters to federal-only elections. See Consent Decree at 7-\n1111  \n16. \n1122  \n41.  As it presently stands, hundreds of thousands of Arizonans are registered to \n1133  \nvote without having provided documentary proof of citizenship to the state. This includes \n1144   31,000 voters in Arizona who are registered using only the Federal Form.3 Additionally, \n1155   Arizona did not require proof of citizenship to get a driver’s license until 1996, and the \n1166   Motor Vehicle Division has reported that at least 192,000 Arizonans who have one of those \n1177   pre-1996 licenses have not re-registered or provided proof of citizenship.4 Accordingly, \n1188   there are at least 192,000 voters who are seemingly entitled to vote in all elections in \nArizona despite never providing proof of citizenship. \n1199  \nB. Arizona voters rely on the state’s early voting system. \n2200  \n2211   42.  Early mail voting is immensely popular in Arizona, and for years, the vast \nmajority of voters have relied on it to cast their ballot. Since 1991, all eligible voters in \n2222  \nArizona have been able to vote early by mail without a reason or “excuse” for doing so. \n2233  \nSee A.R.S. § 16-541. Reliance on early mail voting has steadily grown ever since. In 2008, \n2244  \nover one million Arizonans, or around half of the voters who participated in the election, \n2255  \n2266    \n3 See Howard Fischer, Some Arizona voters could face citizenship check, Ariz. Daily Star \n2277  \n(March  27,  2022),  https://tucson.com/news/local/subscriber/some-arizona-voters-could-\nface-citizenship-check/article_72ec0350-ac76-11ec-a0d72fbe0dcb9094.html. \n2288  \n4 Id. \n  \n-9- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 12 of 22\n \n11   used early mail voting. In 2016, over 2 million voters, or about 75 percent of voters who \n22   participated in the election, used early mail voting. And in 2020, nearly three million \n33   voters, or about 88 percent of those voters who participated in the election, used early mail \n44   voting. \n43.  The ever-increasing reliance on early voting by mail in Arizona has led to an \n55  \nelection-administration system heavily oriented toward mail voting, with a corresponding \n66  \ndecrease in the availability of in-person voting options. In fact, one study found that the \n77  \nstate has had the “most widespread reduction” in polling places of any state over the last \n88  \ndecade—the state now has 320 fewer polling places than it did in 2012.5 While Arizona’s \n99  \ninducement of voters to use early voting by mail has helped to make voting generally more \n1100  \naccessible in the state and has helped counties preserve resources, fewer polling places \n1111  \ntranslates to more difficulties for those who must vote in person. This is especially true in \n1122  \nrural places and on the state’s tribal lands, where voters must travel long distances to their \n1133  \npolling place and where public transportation is not available.  \n1144  \nC. The 2020 election in Arizona was secure and accurate. \n1155  \n44.  Despite the significant challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, \n1166  \nArizona voters turned out in record-setting numbers in 2020. More than 3.4 million of the \n1177  \nstate’s 4.3 million voters, or 79.9 percent, cast a ballot. This compares to 74 percent in \n1188   2016, 74.2 percent in 2012, 74.3 percent in 2008, 77.7 percent in 2004, and 71.8 percent in \n1199   2000.6 \n2200   45.  The security and accuracy of the 2020 election results have been confirmed \n2211   and re-confirmed by county and state election officials, as well as the courts.  \n46.  County election officials have confirmed and scrutinized the results. For \n2222  \nexample, after the election, pursuant to A.R.S. § 16-602, ten of the state’s fifteen counties \n2233  \nperformed a hand count of sample ballots to test the equipment, each confirming the \n2244  \n \n2255  \n5 See The Leadership Conference Education Fund, Democracy Diverted: Polling Place \n2266   Closures  and  the  Right  to  Vote  17  (Sept.  2019), \nhttp://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/reports/Democracy-Diverted.pdf.   \n2277  \n6  Voter  Registration  and  Historical  Election  Data,  Ariz.

In Arizona’s largest county, Clint Hickman, the chair of the Maricopa County \n33   Board of Supervisors, confirmed that “there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct or \n44   malfunction” in a letter that was sent to all Maricopa County voters.7  \n48.  In  February  2021,  the  Maricopa  County  Elections  Department  further \n55  \nconfirmed its results, hiring two auditing firms to conduct audits of the county’s tabulation \n66  \nsystem and equipment, which found no evidence of inaccuracies or improprieties.8 \n77  \n49.  State officials have likewise confirmed the results and have publicly and \n88  \ndefinitively declared their accuracy. Arizona law requires the Secretary, in the Governor’s \n99  \npresence, to certify the statewide canvass. See A.R.S. § 16-648. On November 30, 2020, \n1100  \nSecretary of State Katie Hobbs, in the presence of Governor Ducey, did so. The Governor \n1111  \nhimself further confirmed and defended the accuracy of the results through his social media \n1122  \naccounts and in a meeting at the White House with former President Trump. \n1133  \n50.  Additionally, multiple lawsuits seeking to overturn the results of the election \n1144  \nonly served to further confirm that the election was secure. For example, in Bowyer v. \n1155   Ducey, various Republican officials filed a lawsuit seeking decertification of the election \n1166   based on, among other things, allegations of improprieties in signature matching. The court \n1177   dismissed the suit on multiple grounds, including a lack of any evidence. 506 F. Supp. 3d \n1188   699, 722 (D. Ariz. Dec. 9, 2020).  \n51.  Similarly, in Ward v.

Nevertheless,  fact-free  conspiracy  theories  and  efforts  to  undermine \n22   confidence in the elections process have continued to percolate. In particular, these same \n33   baseless and repeatedly disproven “concerns” have continued to animate claims of fraud \n44   pushed by many Republican officials in the state.  \nD. H.B. 2492 is merely the latest in a string of baseless allegations of fraud that \n55  \nhave led to a host of pernicious efforts in Arizona to target early voting by \n66   mail. \n77  \n53.  When the 2021 legislative session began, Republicans in the Legislature \n88   moved quickly to introduce several bills to severely restrict access to the franchise in \n99   Arizona, relying on continuing evidence-free allegations of fraud in Arizona elections. This \n1100   resulted in the passage of two bills in the 2021 legislative session that restrict the franchise: \n1111   (1) S.B. 1003, which prohibits voters whose early voting by mail ballots are flagged for \nrejection based on a missing signature from curing that deficiency after 7 p.m. on Election \n1122  \nDay;  and  (2)  S.B.  1485,  which  fundamentally  alters  the  state’s  immensely  popular \n1133  \nPermanent Early Voting List—which the new legislation rebrands as the Active Early \n1144  \nVoting List—by requiring election officials to purge from the list any voter who has not \n1155  \nvoted an early ballot “for two consecutive election cycles.” Both bills are aimed squarely \n1166  \nat suppressing voter participation using Arizona’s early voting regime. \n1177  \n54.  Legislation is not the only means of this ongoing assault on early voting by \n1188  \nmail. The Arizona Republican Party recently initiated litigation in the Arizona Supreme \n1199  \nCourt seeking an order declaring that all no-excuse early voting by mail in Arizona, as well \n2200  \nas the use of drop boxes to return ballots, violate the Arizona Constitution. See Compl., \n2211  \nAriz. Republican Party v. Hobbs, No. CV-22-0048-SA (Ariz. Feb. 25, 2022). \n2222  \n55.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction continues this anti-voter trend, marrying \n2233   it to Arizona’s nearly twenty-year effort to introduce roadblocks into its voter registration \n2244   regime. The result is a law which has a host of problematic provisions, including: \n2255     prohibiting  any  registered  voter  (other  than  voters  protected  by  the \n2266   Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) who has not \nprovided adequate proof of citizenship—including potentially all voters \n2277  \nregistered  before  2005  and  all  federal-only  voters—from  voting  in \n2288  \n  \n-12- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 15 of 22\n \n11   presidential elections until they provide adequate proof of citizenship, \n22   with no provisions for how such voters should or will receive notice of \n33   any such prohibition (Section 5); \n44     prohibiting all voters in Arizona who can currently vote only in federal \nelections from voting early by mail in any elections (Section 5);  \n55  \n  prohibiting Arizonans who seek to register without adequate proof of \n66  \ncitizenship from registering to vote in presidential elections or from \n77  \nvoting early by mail (Section 4); \n88  \n  requiring county recorders to reject the application of any voter who \n99  \nsubmits a state registration form without proof of citizenship (Section 4); \n1100  \n  requiring county recorders to research the citizenship of any voter who \n1111  \nsubmits a Federal Form, prohibit any such voter from voting in any \n1122  \nelection if the county recorder cannot determine they are a United States \n1133  \ncitizen, and refer any such voter’s registration to the county attorney and \n1144  \nAttorney General for investigation if the county recorder determines they \n1155  \nare not a United States citizen (Section 4); \n1166  \n  requiring the Secretary of State and county recorders to provide a list to \n1177  \nthe Attorney General of any voters who are registered without proof of \n1188   citizenship,  and  requiring  the  Attorney  General  to  investigate  the \n1199   citizenship of these individuals and report to the Secretary of State, the \n2200   President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House regarding the \n2211   results of his investigation (Section 7); and \n  requiring  the  Attorney  General  to  prosecute  any  individuals  his \n2222  \ninvestigation uncovers are not United States citizens (Section 7). \n2233  \nE. The burdens imposed by the Proof of Citizenship Restriction on the right to \n2244  \nvote are substantial. \n2255  \n56.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction burdens Arizona voters’ ability to vote \n2266  \nby mail and in presidential elections in at least four different ways.  \n2277  \n57.  First, registered voters who properly registered to vote without providing \n2288  \nproof of citizenship—either due to state requirements at the time they registered or because \n  \n-13- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 16 of 22\n \n11   they submitted the Federal Form—may be prohibited from voting in presidential elections \n22   without any notice or opportunity to challenge the State’s determination. H.B. 2492 § 5, \n33   55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022). This includes nearly 200,000 Arizonans who \n44   registered to vote before October 1, 1996,9 and 31,000 Arizonans who registered using the \nFederal Form.10  \n55  \n58.  Furthermore,  those  31,000  Arizonans  who  registered  to  vote  using  the \n66  \nFederal Form would be prohibited from voting early by mail, again without any notice or \n77  \nopportunity to challenge the State’s determination. H.B. 2492 § 5, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. \n88  \n(Ariz. 2022). As discussed above, Arizona has allowed voters to vote by mail for any reason \n99  \nsince 1991. See A.R.S. § 16-541. To now suddenly strip these registered voters of their \n1100  \nability to vote by mail without any notice substantially burdens their fundamental right to \n1111  \nvote. \n1122  \n59.  It bears repeating that despite depriving these voters of their right to vote in \n1133  \npresidential  elections  or  early  by  mail,  the  statute  does  not  include  any  procedural \n1144  \nsafeguards. There is no notice requirement. There is no opportunity for the voter to provide \n1155   documentary proof of citizenship. The statute does not even outline a time frame during \n1166   which this removal of rights should occur. This lack of process will result in registered \n1177   voters being left in the dark about whether and how they can vote. \n1188   60.  Second, the State has once again added another wrinkle to what was already \na confusing, bifurcated voter registration system that frustrates Arizonans’ right to vote. \n1199  \nThis system has already resulted in allegations of disenfranchisement resulting in an \n2200  \nongoing consent decree, whose requirements seem potentially in conflict with the Proof of \n2211  \nCitizenship Restriction. See Compl. ¶¶ 39, 77-88, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-cv-04102-\n2222  \nDGC (Nov. 7, 2017), ECF No. 1; Consent Decree at 7-16. The law will likely undo any \n2233  \n2244  \n \n9 See Laurie Roberts, Republicans want HOW MANY Arizonans to prove they have a right \n2255  \nto  vote?,  The  Ariz.  Republic  (March  28,  2022,  9:12  AM), \n2266   https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/03/28/arizona-voters-\nmay-soon-prove-right-vote-citizenship/7192260001/. \n2277  \n10 See Howard Fischer, Some Arizona voters could face citizenship check, Ariz.

Third, the law will require hundreds of thousands of voters who never had to \nprovide further documentation to do so if they wish to continue to vote in presidential \n55  \nelections or (for Federal Form voters) to continue voting early by mail for any election. For \n66  \nmany voters who lack such documentation, the costs in time and effort to obtain it are \n77  \nsubstantial, and result in many voters simply giving up and being disenfranchised. Other \n88  \ncourts considering challenges to similar laws have found these consequences to constitute \n99  \na substantial burden on the right to vote. See, e.g., Fish v. Schwab, 957 F.3d 1105, 1131 \n1100  \n(10th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 965 (2020) (explaining that “extensive testimony \n1111  \nabout individual voters like Mr. Fish and Ms. Bucci who lacked [proof of citizenship] or \n1122  \nfaced significant costs to obtain it” permitted “the district court [to] properly conclude here \n1133  \nthat the [citizenship documentation] requirement imposed a significant burden on the right \n1144  \nto vote”); League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“It \n1155   does not matter whether that is because they lack access to the requisite documentary proof \n1166   or simply because the process of obtaining that proof is so onerous that they give up. The \n1177   outcome is the same—the abridgment of the right to vote.”). \n1188   62.  Fourth, the law subjects potential voters to investigation by the Attorney \nGeneral based solely on a county recorder’s inability to locate them in certain enumerated \n1199  \ndatabases. Such inability could result from something as simple as a typographical or \n2200  \ntranscription error, and fear of wrongful investigation may chill otherwise eligible voters \n2211  \nfrom seeking to register to vote or exercising the franchise.  \n2222  \n63.  Taken together, this host of harms constitutes a substantial burden on the \n2233  \nright to vote. \n2244  \nF.  The Proof of Citizenship Restriction serves no justifiable state interest. \n2255  \n64.  As with so many pernicious voting restrictions, proponents of the Proof of \n2266  \nCitizenship Restriction justify it by invoking the boogeyman of voter fraud without any \n2277  \nproof  to  support  their  claims.  During  the  Legislature’s  consideration  of  the  Bill,  no \n2288  \nlegislator identified a single instance of voter fraud or impropriety in Arizona related to \n  \n-15- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 18 of 22\n \n11   mail-in early voting ballots that would precipitate the need for the changes at issue. Instead, \n22   evidence-free assertions were offered such as that by Bill Sponsor Rep. Jake Hoffman, who \n33   stated that the Bill was needed because Arizona “cannot allow potentially tens of thousands \n44   of noncitizens to vote in our elections.”11 This unsupported fearmongering is plainly \ninsufficient to justify the Proof of Citizenship Restriction’s widespread burdens. \n55  \n65.  Meanwhile,  the  Legislature’s  own  lawyers  advised  that  the  Proof  of \n66  \nCitizenship Restriction violates federal law and invites litigation.12 Indeed, Speaker Pro \n77  \nTempore of the Arizona House Travis Grantham acknowledged that a motivation behind \n88  \nthe law is to broadly challenge the constitutionality of the NVRA, stating that the law was \n99  \nimportant to “fight for local control of our elections” and that challenging related federal \n1100  \nrulings was “a fight worth having.”13 But disagreement with and open defiance of federal \n1111  \nlaw does not provide adequate justification for the Proof of Citizenship Restriction’s \n1122  \nsignificant burdens on Arizonans’ voting rights. \n1133  \n66.  Other courts have rightfully found similar laws to be unconstitutional. For \n1144  \nexample, in 2011 Kansas adopted a similar law, which required state and county election \n1155   officials to reject voter registration applications unless the applicant submitted “satisfactory \n1166   evidence of United States citizenship.” Fish, 957 F.3d at 1111 (quoting Secure and Fair \n1177   Elections (“SAFE”) Act, ch. 56, § 8(l), 2011 Kan.

Id. at 1121. The Court found particularly relevant \n33   the  fact  that  the  Kansas  law  impacted  31,089  applicants  who  were  prevented  from \n44   registering to vote distinguished this from other voting restrictions where the burden was \nless clear. See id. at 1129.  \n55  \n67.  As noted above, the Proof of Citizenship Restriction imposes significant new \n66  \nrestrictions and burdens on a minimum of approximately 200,000 Arizonans, an impact \n77  \nover six times greater than that which gave the Tenth Circuit such pause in Fish. As in \n88  \nFish,  there  can  be  little  doubt  that  the  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  imposes  an \n99  \nunconstitutional burden on the right to vote. \n1100  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n1111  \nCOUNT I \n1122  \nUnjustifiable Burden on the Right to Vote  \n1133   U.S. Const.

The Proof of Citizenship Restriction imposes a disparate and unjustifiable \n2266   burden on the right to vote. As detailed above, it strips voters of the right to vote in \n2277   presidential elections or by mail without notice, adds further confusion to what was already \na convoluted registration process that has led to disenfranchisement, imposes substantial \n2288  \n  \n-17- \nPLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SMB   Document 1   Filed 03/31/22   Page 20 of 22\n \n11   new costs on hundreds of thousands of Arizonans to exercise the franchise, and exposes \n22   voters to the threat of baseless investigation by the Attorney General. Both individually \n33   and in combination these harms impose a significant—and in many cases severe—burden \n44   on the right to vote. \n72.

To determine whether a plaintiff has been denied procedural due process in \n1122   violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a court first asks \n1133   whether a constitutionally protected liberty interest is at stake. If so, the court determines \nwhether the procedural protections provided are sufficient by applying the Anderson-\n1144  \nBurdick test as described above. Ariz. Democratic Party v. Hobbs, 18 F.4th 1179, 1195 \n1155  \n(9th Cir. 2021) (holding that “the Anderson/Burdick approach is better suited to the context \n1166  \nof election laws than is the more general Eldridge test” (quoting Richardson v.

Because Arizona allows all \n2211  \nregistered voters to exercise their fundamental right to vote early by mail, there is a \n2222  \nconstitutionally protected liberty interest involved in the process of casting a ballot by mail \n2233  \nand in having that ballot counted. See, e.g., Democracy N.C. v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, \n2244   476  F.

As a \n66  \nresult, Defendants may not deprive voters of the right to vote early by mail without \n77  \nproviding adequate procedures. \n88  \n76.  Arizona’s  Proof  of  Citizenship  Restriction  will  deprive  hundreds  of \n99  \nthousands of currently registered voters of their ability to vote by mail in future elections. \n1100  \nIt does so while giving no details about any notice these voters will be provided, or how or \n1111  \nwhen they may cure this defect. \n1122  \n77.

In 2022, the Arizona Legislature enacted and Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona \n14  signed into law two bills, House Bill 2492 (“HB 2492”) and House Bill 2243 (“HB 2243”), that \nimpose a host of arbitrary and discriminatory burdens on eligible Arizona voters in violation of \n15 \nthe  United  States  Constitution,  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  (CRA),  the  National  Voter \n16 \nRegistration Act (NVRA), and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  \n17 \n2.  HB 2492 was adopted in explicit defiance of federal law and the United States \n18 \nConstitution. After nonpartisan legal staff advised the Arizona legislature that the bill would likely \n19 \nviolate federal law, one of the bill’s proponents expressly acknowledged that defiance is a purpose \n20 \nof HB 2492. \n21 \n22 \n  2 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 3 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  3.  Among other violative provisions, HB2492 requires that eligible Arizonans provide \n2  documentary proof of citizenship and residence in order to register to vote; requires that election \nofficials reject the registration applications of Arizonans who do provide documentary proof of \n3 \ncitizenship if they fail to check a box on the voter registration application, or if they fail to provide \n4 \ntheir place of birth on their application; and conditions an applicant’s right to vote on the seemingly \n5 \ninconsequential choice of whether to use a state versus a federal voter registration form. These \n6 \narbitrary, burdensome, and immaterial barriers to registering to vote are directly at odds with \n7 \nfederal law.  \n8 \n4.  In addition, HB 2492 denies certain Arizonans—those who are unable to provide \n9 \ndocumentary proof of citizenship but are entitled to register and vote in federal elections—the right \n10 \nto vote on an equal basis with all other Arizona voters by prohibiting these “Federal-only” voters \n11 \nfrom voting by mail. \n12  5.  In an extraordinary step that defies any conception of popular sovereignty, HB 2492 \n13  also denies eligible Federal-only voters their equal right to vote for the President of the United \n14  States.  \n6.  No other state in the nation has abridged the fundamental right to vote for eligible \n15 \nvoters in a such a manner.  \n16 \n7.  HB 2492 discriminates against Native American voters from tribes located in \n17 \nArizona by imposing a proof of residential address requirement for voter registration that will \n18 \nprohibit many Native voters living on reservations from registering to vote, despite an existing \n19 \nstipulation providing accommodations for such voters with respect to the same requirement under \n20 \nArizona’s voter ID law. \n21 \n22 \n  3 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 4 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  8.   Finally, HB 2492 and HB 2243 intentionally discriminate against naturalized U.S. \n2  citizens, Latinos, and members of language minority communities by (i) subjecting them to \nheightened  burdens  to  register  and  vote;  (ii)  mandating  that  elected  officials  reject  voter \n3 \nregistration applications and purge registered voters from the registration rolls based on outdated \n4 \nand incorrect U.S. citizenship data derived from unreliable sources; (iii) subjecting eligible voters \n5 \nto  harassment,  criminal  investigation;  and  (iv)  prosecution  by  Intervenor-Defendant  Mark \n6 \nBrnovich, and singling out naturalized U.S. citizens for harassment based on their place of birth—\n7 \na fact that has no bearing on their eligibility to vote.  \n8 \n9.  Plaintiffs Living United for Change in Arizona (“LUCHA”), League of United \n9 \nLatin American Citizens (“LULAC”), Arizona Students’ Association (“ASA”), ADRC Action \n10 \n(“ADRC”), Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (“ITCA”), the San Carlos Apache Tribe, and the \n11 \nArizona Coalition for Change (“AZC4C”) bring this Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive \n12  Relief to remedy the violations alleged herein. \n13  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n14  10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, and 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301, et seq. \n15 \n11.  This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1362, which provides that \n16 \n“district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or \n17 \nband with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter \n18 \nin controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” \n19 \n12.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant Secretary of State Hobbs and \n20 \nIntervenor-Defendant Attorney General Mark Brnovich, elected constitutional officers for and \n21 \nresidents of the State of Arizona. \n22 \n  4 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 5 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  13.  Intervenor-Defendant the State of Arizona has waived sovereign immunity and \n2  submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court by voluntarily intervening to defend this action. Clark \nv. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447 (1883). \n3 \n14.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n4 \n15.  This Court has authority to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 \n5 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n6 \nFACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND \n7   \n16.  On March 30, 2022, Governor Ducey signed into law House Bill 2492 (“HB \n8 \n2492”). \n9 \n17.  On April 22, 2022, Governor Ducey signed Senate Bill 1638, which made a \n10 \ntechnical amendment to one section of HB 2492 and delayed the effective date for all of HB 2492’s \n11 \nprovisions to December 31, 2022.  \n12  18.  On June 23, 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed House Bill 2243 (“HB 2243”), \n13  which was signed into law by Governor Ducey on July 6, 2022. \n14  19.  HB 2243’s provisions will become effective September 24, 2022. \nDocumentary Proof of Residence Requirement \n15 \n20.  HB 2492 violates federal law by requiring that eligible Arizona voters, with narrow \n16 \nexceptions for qualified individuals temporarily absent from the State, provide documentary proof \n17 \nof residence (“DPOR”) to register to vote in any election.  \n18 \n21.  DPOR is defined as “an identifying document that establishes proof of location of \n19 \nresidence.” HB 2492 § 5 (to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-123). Under HB 2492, “a valid and \n20 \nunexpired Arizona Driver License or nonoperating identification number that is properly verified \n21 \nby the county recorder satisfies the requirements of this section.” Id.  \n22 \n  5 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 6 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  22.  In addition, HB 2492 states that “any of the identifying documents” required for \n2  identification while voting under A.R.S. § 16-579(A)(1) “constitutes satisfactory proof of location \nof residence.” HB 2492 § 5 (to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-123). Those documents are:  \n3 \n(a) A valid form of identification that bears the photograph, name and address of \n4 \nthe elector that reasonably appear to be the same as the name and address in the \nprecinct register, including an Arizona driver license, an Arizona nonoperating \n5 \nidentification license, a tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal identification \nor  a  United  States  federal,  state  or  local  government  issued  identification. \n6  Identification is deemed valid unless it can be determined on its face that it has \nexpired. \n7   \n(b) Two different items that contain the name and address of the elector that \n8  reasonably appear to be the same as the name and address in the precinct register, \nincluding a utility bill, a bank or credit union statement that is dated within ninety \ndays of the date of the election, a valid Arizona vehicle registration, an Arizona \n9 \nvehicle insurance card, an Indian census card, tribal enrollment card or other form \nof tribal identification, a property tax statement, a recorder’s certificate, a voter \n10 \nregistration card, a valid United States federal, state or local government issued \nidentification  or  any  mailing  that  is  labeled  as  “official  election  material”. \n11 \nIdentification is deemed valid unless it can be determined on its face that it has \nexpired. \n12   \n(c) A valid form of identification that bears the photograph, name and address of \n13  the elector except that if the address on the identification does not reasonably appear \nto be the same as the address in the precinct register or the identification is a valid \n14  United States military identification card or a valid United States passport and does \nnot bear an address, the identification must be accompanied by one of the items \nlisted in subdivision (b) of this paragraph. \n15 \n \nA.R.S. § 16-579(A)(1). \n16 \n \n23.  All voters in Arizona registering to vote must attest to their legal residence under \n17 \nthe penalty of perjury. And under existing law, the above documentation of residence is already \n18 \nprovided at the time of voting in person (subject to a stipulation providing for voting access for \n19 \nNative voters).  \n20 \n24.  HB 2492’s DPOR Requirement imposes new and duplicative burdens on voters to \n21 \naccess or obtain, copy, print, and submit the required documents at the time they register.  \n22 \n  6 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 7 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  25.  The DPOR Requirement will most affect Arizonans who lack a valid Arizona \n2  driver’s license or nonoperating state-ID card and will have a more difficult time accessing and \nproviding the documentation to prove their residence. These disparately burdened Arizonans \n3 \ninclude low-income voters, college and university students, enrolled members of Arizona tribes, \n4 \nand voters who frequently move, many of whom for circumstances largely beyond their control, \n5 \nsuch as employment, family and school demands.  \n6 \n26.  Further, the DPOR Requirement may effectively bar eligible voters who live in a \n7 \nresidence without a numbered street address from registering to vote because these registrants lack \n8 \nany documents containing their nonexistent residential address.  \n9 \n27.  In recognition of the substantial number of eligible voters whose residence does not \n10 \nhave a numbered street address, the State of Arizona permits registrants to include a description \n11 \nand drawing of their place of residence on their voter application form, rather than a numbered \n12  street address.1 \n13  28.  However, HB 2492 contains no exceptions to the DPOR Requirement for these \n14  eligible voters without a numbered street address. \n29.  Because many residences on Indian reservations in Arizona lack a numbered street \n15 \naddress or residential address, many enrolled members of tribes are likely to be prevented from \n16 \nvoting by the DPOR Requirement. \n17 \n30.  For example, on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, where Plaintiff San Carlos \n18 \nApache Tribe is located, there is not a uniform residential numbering system for physical addresses \n19 \nthat identifies residences by a street address or residence or building number.   \n20 \n \n21 \n \n1  See  Arizona  Secretary  of  State,  Arizona  Voter  Registration  Form  (Jan.  2022), \n22  https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/2022_Voter_Registration_Form.pdf. \n  7 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 8 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  31.  For example, there are at least 100 residential or access roads that lead to residences, \n2  located on the south side of U.S. Route 70, which connects Ft. Thomas to Globe, Arizona, that \nhave no names or route number.  \n3 \n32.  Accordingly, many residences are not assigned a physical numbered street address. \n4 \nInstead, members of the Tribe commonly describe where they live using common road names, \n5 \nmile markers on Route 70, Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Indian Routes, or other landmarks and \n6 \ndistances.  \n7 \n33.  For example, one resident of the Reservation would refer to his home as located on \n8 \nthe south side of Route 70, just outside and several miles west the community of Peridot, near mile \n9 \nmarker 268, and then 300 yards down that dirt road. \n10 \n34.  For this reason, the Tribe’s enrolled members living on the Reservation commonly \n11 \nreceive mail at post office boxes located on or near the Reservation. \n12  35.  Because many homes on the San Carlos Apache Reservation do not have numbered \n13  street addresses, the Tribe’s members who live on the Reservation often do not have documents \n14  listing  their  name  and  residential  address,  and  thus  will  be  unable  to  satisfy  the  DPOR \nRequirement. \n15 \n36.  By  not  satisfying  that  Requirement,  such  members  would  effectively  be \n16 \ndisenfranchised. \n17 \n37.  In addition to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, other ITCA Member Tribes also have \n18 \nlarge and rural reservations, and their members commonly lack the type of documentation required \n19 \nby HB 2492. Many members of these tribes similarly lack the documentation mandated by the \n20 \nDPOR Requirement and will therefore be barred from voting by HB 2492. \n21 \n22 \n  8 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 9 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  38.  The experience for citizens of the San Carlos Apache is also the norm for many \n2  other Tribal citizens residing on the reservations of ITCA’s other Member Tribes in Arizona.  \n39.  In recognition of the particular burdens Native voters would otherwise face, under \n3 \na stipulation in Gonzalez v. Arizona, members of federally recognized Indian tribes are entitled to \n4 \npresent Tribal identification at the polls that does not include a numbered street address. See \n5 \nGonzalez v. Arizona, CV 06-1268-PHX-ROS, Joint Stipulation, (D. Ariz. Apr. 18, 2008). Voters \n6 \nneeding this accommodation are given a provisional ballot that is counted without additional \n7 \ndocumentation. \n8 \n40.  The new DPOR Requirement for voter registration under HB 2492 contains no \n9 \naccommodation for tribal identification that does not include a residential address or otherwise \n10 \ndoes not meet the requirements of Arizona Statute § 16-579. \n11 \n41.  As a result, members of tribes who are eligible to vote and have identification \n12  sufficient to enable them to cast a ballot in person under the Gonzalez stipulation will nonetheless \n13  be prohibited from registering to vote under HB 2492. \n14  42.  The DPOR Requirement also makes no provision for how people experiencing \nhomelessness can comply with its mandates and register to vote.  \n15 \n43.  The  DPOR  Requirement  will  also  burden  voters  who  would  otherwise  take \n16 \nadvantage of voter registration drives.  \n17 \n44.  Additional documentation requirements for registration beyond a standardized \n18 \nform make traditional voter registration activity nearly impossible. Potential voters often do not \n19 \ncarry  documentary  proof  of  residence  with  them  while  out  in  the  community.  And  those \n20 \nconducting voter registration drives cannot easily incorporate the equipment needed to copy such \n21 \ndocumentation for submission with paper voter registration forms.  \n22 \n  9 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 10 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  45.  Arizona voters may register to vote using either the Arizona Voter Registration \n2  Form (“State Form”) or the National Mail Voter Registration Form (“Federal Form”), which is \npromulgated by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (“EAC”) under the NVRA.  \n3 \n46.  Arizona voters may also register online (if they have a valid Arizona Driver’s \n4 \nLicense and/or an Arizona non-operating I.D. card issued by the Motor Vehicle Division), in \n5 \nperson at a County Recorder’s office, or at a NVRA-mandated public agency.  \n6 \n47.  Under the NVRA, all states must “accept and use” the Federal Form, which only \n7 \nrequires attestation of residence and does not require documentary proof of residence. 52 U.S.C.  \n8 \n§ 20505. \n9 \n48.  The NVRA preempts any attempt by states to impose additional requirements to \n10 \nprove citizenship, residence, or any other qualification above and beyond those provided by the \n11 \nFederal Form. \n12  49.  HB 2492’s DPOR Requirement purports to prohibit county election officials from \n13  registering otherwise eligible voters—including those who submitted a completed Federal Form—\n14  unless they provide DPOR, in flagrant violation of federal law.  \n50.  The Supreme Court rejected Arizona’s attempt to impose a documentary proof of \n15 \ncitizenship requirement on registrants using the Federal Form less than a decade ago. See Arizona \n16 \nv. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 18 (2013) (holding that the NVRA’s requirement \n17 \nthat states “accept and use” the Federal Form “acts as both a ceiling and a floor” for registering to \n18 \nvote in federal elections).  \n19 \n51.  The NVRA also requires that certain mandated public assistance agencies provide \n20 \nvoter registration services using the Federal Form or “its equivalent.” 52 U.S.C. § 20506. \n21 \n22 \n  10 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 11 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  52.  To the extent HB 2492 seeks to impose the DPOR Requirement on applicants \n2  registering at NVRA-mandated agencies, it is preempted by the NVRA because an “equivalent” \nform would not require documentary proof of residence.  \n3 \n53.  Under the NVRA, a voter registration application provided at a state’s motor \n4 \nvehicle authority may require only the minimum amount of information necessary to “(i) prevent \n5 \nduplicate voter registrations; and (ii) enable State election officials to assess the eligibility of the \n6 \napplicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process.” 52 U.S.C. § \n7 \n20504.  \n8 \n54.  The Arizona Motor Vehicle Division implements these provisions, and the DPOR \n9 \nRequirement is preempted by the NVRA to the extent it is inconsistent with the Motor Vehicle \n10 \nDivision’s federal voter registration obligations.  \n11 \nBirthplace Requirement \n12  55.  HB 2492 mandates that eligible Arizonans provide their birthplace when registering \n13  to vote and directs county election officials not to register voters who fail to list their place of birth \n14  on the grounds that such an application is “incomplete.” HB 2492 § 4 (to be codified at A.R.S. § \n16-121.01).  \n15 \n56.  A voter’s birthplace is wholly immaterial to their qualifications to vote. Arizona’s \n16 \nvoter qualifications require that a person be eighteen years old, a current U.S. citizen, and a current \n17 \nresident of Arizona and the specific jurisdiction in which they are registering to vote. A person’s \n18 \nplace of birth has no bearing whether they are eighteen, currently a citizen of the United States, or \n19 \na resident of Arizona and the specific jurisdiction in which they are registering. \n20 \n57.  Arizona’s State Form already contains a field for inputting place of birth, see A.R.S. \n21 \n§ 16-152(A), but until HB 2492 goes into effect, applicants who omit the field will nonetheless be \n22 \n  11 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 12 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  registered to vote. See id. § 16-121.01(A); Ariz. Sec’y of State, 2019 Elections Procedures Manual \n2  at 19 (Dec. 2019). This is because birthplace is immaterial to voter eligibility. \n58.  The Birthplace Requirement, combined with HB 2492’s provisions that mandate \n3 \naggressive investigation and prosecution of alleged non-U.S. citizens (based on faulty data that \n4 \nwill inevitably target naturalized citizens), is intended to, and will, intimidate eligible voters who \n5 \nwere born outside of the United States.  \n6 \n59.  The Birthplace Requirement serves no purpose other than to single out naturalized \n7 \nU.S. citizens for harassment, including by election administrators and law enforcement officials. \n8 \n60.  The Birthplace Requirement unlawfully discriminates against naturalized U.S. \n9 \ncitizen voters based on their country of origin. \n10 \n61.  The Birthplace Requirement violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 52 U.S.C. § \n11 \n10101(a)(2)(B), by denying the right to register and to vote to eligible Arizonans who omit their \n12  place of birth from their voter registration application.  \n13  62.  To the extent HB 2492 seeks to impose the Birthplace Requirement on applicants \n14  registering at NVRA-mandated agencies or the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division, it is preempted \nby the NVRA because a form “equivalent” to the Federal Form would not require place of birth \n15 \nand that information is certainly not “necessary” to assessing eligibility.  \n16 \nU.S. Citizenship Checkmark Requirement \n17 \n63.  HB 2492 requires that all voter registration applicants, include “a checkmark or \n18 \nother appropriate mark in the ‘Yes’ box next to the question regarding citizenship.” HB 2492 § 4 \n19 \n(to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-121.01). An application that omits this checkmark, regardless of the \n20 \ncircumstances, will be rejected. Id.  \n21 \n22 \n  12 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 13 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  64.  This Checkmark Requirement applies even when an applicant has already attested \n2  to their U.S. citizenship under penalty of perjury using the Federal Form.  \n65.  The Checkmark Requirement applies even when the applicant has supplied the type \n3 \nof DPOC identified in HB 2492 as “satisfactory evidence of citizenship.” HB 2492 § 1 (to be \n4 \ncodified at A.R.S. § 16-101).  \n5 \n66.  The Checkmark Requirement is immaterial to an applicant’s eligibility to vote \n6 \nwhere the applicant has otherwise attested to their U.S. citizenship under penalty of perjury or \n7 \nprovide DPOC under Arizona law. \n8 \n67.  The immaterial Checkmark Requirement violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 52 \n9 \nU.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B), by denying the right to register and to vote to eligible Arizonans who \n10 \naccidentally omit the checkmark from their voter registration application. A person’s ability to \n11 \ncheck a box is immaterial to determining whether an individual is eligible to vote in Arizona, \n12  where election officials already have adequate evidence of the applicant’s citizenship. \n13  Documentary Proof of U.S. Citizenship Requirements \n14  68.  HB 2492 violates federal law by requiring Arizonans to provide documentary proof \nof U.S. citizenship (“DPOC”) as an eligibility requirement to register and to vote. See HB 2492 § \n15 \n1 (to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-101); § 3 (to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-121); § 4 (to be codified \n16 \nat A.R.S. § 16-121.01). \n17 \n69.  When HB 2492 goes into effect, Arizona will be the only state in the country that \n18 \nenforces a DPOC requirement for voter registration and voting.  \n19 \n70.  HB  2492’s  DPOC  Requirements  impose  additional  severe,  undue,  and \n20 \ndiscriminatory burdens on the right to vote for eligible Arizonans who lack DPOC. \n21 \n22 \n  13 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 14 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  71.  Per expert estimates, as many as seven percent of United States citizens lack ready \n2  access to citizenship documents.2 In Arizona, this means that as many as 509,342 eligible voters \nlack DPOC.3 \n3 \n72.  HB 2492’s DPOC Requirements would deny these eligible citizens their rights to \n4 \nregister and to vote.  \n5 \n73.  Arizona’s attempt to impose a DPOC requirement on its voters has a substantial \n6 \nhistory in the federal courts.  \n7 \n74.  In 2004, Arizona enacted Proposition 200, which, among other things, imposed a \n8 \nDPOC requirement for voter registration. \n9 \n75.  After Proposition 200’s passage, the EAC denied Arizona’s request to include its \n10 \nDPOC requirement in the state-specific instructions for voter registration in Arizona on the Federal \n11 \nForm.  \n12  76.  After years of litigation, the Supreme Court held that the NVRA’s requirement that \n13  states  “accept  and  use”  the  Federal  Form  preempted  Arizona’s  DPOC  requirement  under \n14  Proposition 200 as applied to the Federal Form. Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 \nU.S. 1, 18 (2013). \n15 \n77.  Rather than abandoning the Proposition 200 DPOC requirement in light of the \n16 \nSupreme Court’s decision and its unsuccessful request to the EAC (as several other states did), \n17 \n18 \n19 \n \n \n20 \n2 “Citizens Without Proof: A Survey of Americans’ Possession of Documentary Proof of \nCitizenship  and  Photo  Identification,”  Brennan  Center  for  Justice  (2006), \n21 \nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/d/download_file_39242.pdf.  \n3 The U.S. Census Bureau estimates Arizona’s total population is 7,276,316 as of July 1, \n22  2021. \n  14 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 15 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  Arizona enacted a dual voter registration system allowing it to enforce its DPOC requirement only \n2  for state and local elections. Ariz. Op. Atty. Gen. No. I13-011 (2013). \n78.  From 2014 to 2018, Arizona operated this dual voter registration system in a \n3 \nmanner that not only imposed the undue burden of the DPOC requirement on eligible voters but \n4 \nalso arbitrarily disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters solely because they registered  using \n5 \nthe State Form rather than the Federal Form.  \n6 \n79.  If the voter completed the Federal Form without DPOC, the voter was registered to \n7 \nvote in federal elections but not state elections and advised to submit DPOC to vote in state \n8 \nelections. These voters were assigned to the Federal-Only Voter List.  \n9 \n80.  If the voter applied using either a State Form or a Federal Form and did supply \n10 \nDPOC, they could vote in all eligible local, state, and federal elections. These voters were assigned \n11 \nto the Full-Ballot Voter List.  \n12  81.  If the voter completed the State Form without DPOC, the voter was not registered \n13  for state or federal elections and, in violation of prior court order, was not advised of the Federal \n14  Form option.  \n82.  In 2018, Plaintiffs LULAC and ASA sued then-Secretary of State Reagan in \n15 \nLULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-cv-04102-DGC (D. Ariz.), alleging that the dual-registration system \n16 \nviolated the NVRA and the United States Constitution. \n17 \n83.   The LULAC v. Reagan parties reached a consent decree in which the Secretary of \n18 \nState agreed not to condition voter registration based on the arbitrary distinction of whether a voter \n19 \nused the State Form or the Federal Form to apply for voter registration.  \n20 \n84.  The LULAC v. Reagan consent decree established, in relevant part, that Arizona \n21 \nwould (a) register eligible applicants whose registration was not accompanied by DPOC and whose \n22 \n  15 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 16 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  citizenship could not be verified through the Motor Vehicle Division to the Federal-Only Voter \n2  List and (b) provide a ballot to vote in all available federal elections to all registered voters on the \nFederal-Only Voter List. See Consent Decree, LULAC v. Reagan, No. 2:17-cv-04102-DGC, ECF \n3 \nNo. 37 (D. Ariz. June 18, 2018). \n4 \n85.  The Secretary codified the consent decree framework in the Arizona Elections \n5 \nProcedures Manual. \n6 \n86.  HB 2492 purports to abrogate the consent decree and reinstate the prior arbitrary \n7 \nsystem under which voter registration is conditioned on whether a voter submits the State Form or \n8 \nFederal Form.  \n9 \n87.  Under HB 2492, if an eligible voter provides DPOC at the time of registration and \n10 \napplies using a State Form or Federal Form, they can vote in all available local, state, and federal \n11 \nelections.  \n12  88.  If an eligible voter without DPOC submits the Federal Form, the voter will be \n13  registered to vote only in certain federal elections, as described below.  \n14  89.  But if that same voter applies using the State Form and does not provide DPOC, \nHB 2492 instructs that their registration be rejected outright. HB 2492, § 4.C. \n15 \n90.  This arbitrary distinction is unconstitutional and requires the Secretary to violate a \n16 \nfederal consent decree.  \n17 \n91.  Additionally, nothing in HB 2492 requires that rejected State Form applicants be \n18 \nadvised of the Federal Form option, in violation of their federal rights and prior court order. See \n19 \nGonzalez v. Arizona, No. 06-cv-1268, 2013 WL 7767705, at *1 (D. Ariz. Sept. 11, 2013). \n20 \n21 \n22 \n  16 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 17 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  Severe and Disparate Restrictions on Eligible Federal-Only Voters \n2  92.  HB 2492 discriminates against and imposes a severe, undue, and discriminatory \nburden on the class of eligible Arizona voters who have exercised their right to register for federal \n3 \nelections without supplying DPOC.  \n4 \n93.  Before HB 2492, an eligible voter registered on the Federal-Only Voter List \n5 \nreceived a ballot to vote in all relevant federal elections and was treated the same in all other \n6 \nrespects as a registered voter on the Full-Ballot Voter List.  \n7 \n94.  As mandated by federal law and the LULAC v. Reagan consent decree, registered \n8 \nvoters on the Federal-Only Voter List are entitled to use Arizona’s mail voting opportunities and \n9 \nto vote in presidential and congressional elections.  \n10 \n95.  HB 2492 arbitrarily discriminates against eligible, registered voters on the Federal-\n11 \nOnly Voter Lists.  \n12  96.  First, HB 2492 denies this class of eligible, registered voters the right to vote by \n13  mail, even if they are not physically present in the State to cast a ballot. HB 2492 § 4 (to be codified \n14  at A.R.S. § 16-121.01); § 5 (to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-127). This discriminatory restriction \ndenies this class of eligible voters their right to vote on an equal basis as other Arizona voters.  \n15 \n97.  Second, HB 2492 denies this class of eligible, registered voters the right to vote in \n16 \npresidential elections. HB 2492 § 4 (to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-121.01); § 5 (to be codified at \n17 \nA.R.S. § 16-127). This discriminatory restriction denies this class of eligible voters their right to \n18 \nvote on an equal basis as other Arizona voters. \n19 \n98.  HB2492 singles out eligible, registered voters on the Federal-Only Voter Lists for \n20 \ndiscriminatory treatment by restricting them to voting only in-person and only in congressional \n21 \nelections.  \n22 \n  17 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 18 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  99.  HB  2492’s  arbitrary,  discriminatory,  and  burdensome  limits  on  voting  for \n2  registrants on the Federal-Only Voter List violate federal constitutional and statutory rights.    \nDiscrimination Against Naturalized U.S. Citizens \n3 \n100.  HB 2492 compels election officials to reject valid voter registration applications \n4 \nfrom eligible voters based on vague criteria and using faulty inputs from databases that are known \n5 \nto have unreliable citizenship data. These provisions discriminate against naturalized U.S. citizens.  \n6 \n101.  HB 2492 mandates that election officials “use all available resources to verify the \n7 \ncitizenship status” of a registration applicant or currently registered voter, without any requirement \n8 \nfor the veracity of those “available resources.” HB 2492 § 7 (to be codified at A.R.S. § 16-143) \n9 \n102.  The specified resources that HB 2492 mandates that election officials check for \n10 \nU.S. citizenship information are notoriously unreliable and contain outdated and faulty data that \n11 \ndo not accurately reflect U.S. citizenship status.   \n12  103.  Included among the “available resources” are databases from Arizona’s Motor \n13  Vehicles Division, the Social Security Administration, a National Association for Public Health \n14  Statistics and Information Systems, and “any other state, city, town, county or federal database.” \nId. \n15 \n104.  None  of  these  databases  are  designed  to  contain  or  reflect  up-to-date  U.S. \n16 \ncitizenship status.  \n17 \n105.  In Arizona, a person’s driver’s license does not expire until the licensee reaches age \n18 \n65. Thus, a driver’s license can be valid for nearly fifty years.  \n19 \n106.  In recent years, between 12,000 and 15,000 Arizonans have naturalized each year.  \n20 \n21 \n22 \n  18 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 19 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  107.  Arizona Motor Vehicle Division data that indicates that a person was not a U.S. \n2  citizen at the time they were issued a driver’s license or identification card—up to almost fifty \nyears ago—is not probative of whether they are a U.S. citizen today.  \n3 \n108.  Nonetheless, HB 2492 requires county recorders to reject the voter registration \n4 \napplication of an individual whose MVD record shows they were not a U.S. citizen at the time \n5 \nthey obtained their driver’s license or non-driver identification card.  \n6 \n109.  Any election official who fails to comply with this requirement faces potential \n7 \nfelony prosecution.  \n8 \n110.  If, after receiving a notice, the voter does not provide satisfactory DPOC  or \n9 \nattestation of residence within 35 days, the Recorder must cancel the registration. The county \n10 \nrecorder must notify the county attorney and Attorney General of all cancelled registrations for \n11 \nfailure to provide satisfactory DPOC for possible investigation. HB 2243 § 2 (to be codified at \n12  A.R.S. § 16-165).  \n13  111.  HB 2243 also requires the Secretary of State to compare on a monthly basis the \n14  statewide voter registration database to the driver license database maintained by the Arizona \nDepartment of Transportation (ADOT) and notify the appropriate county recorder if the ADOT \n15 \ndatabase indicates that a person who is registered to vote in that county was not a U.S. citizen at \n16 \nthe time their ADOT identification as issued. Id.  \n17 \n112.  HB 2243 further requires county recorders to complete monthly checks comparing \n18 \nthe county’s voter registration database with the Social Security Administration Database. Id.  \n19 \n113.  On a monthly basis, HB 2243 requires county recorders to identify registered voters \n20 \nwho have not provided DPOC or “who the county Recorder has reason to believe are not United \n21 \nStates citizens” and compare them against the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements \n22 \n  19 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 20 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  (SAVE)  database  maintained  by  USCIS,  the  electronic  verification  of  vital  events  system \n2  maintained by a national association for public health statistics and information systems, and any \n“relevant city, town, county state and federal databases to which the county Recorder has access[.]” \n3 \nId.  \n4 \n114.  HB 2243 also requires county recorders to initiate the removal process if they \n5 \nreceive a report from the jury commissioner or jury manager, under A.R.S. § 21-314, indicating \n6 \nthat the voter has changed residence or is not a U.S. citizen.  \n7 \n115.  HB 2492 and HB 2243’s mandated error-prone  database checks  will  lead to \n8 \ninaccuracies and result in election officials erroneously rejecting numerous voter registration \n9 \napplications from eligible Arizona voters.  \n10 \n116.  Because these databases are faulty and contain notoriously stale data, this system \n11 \nwill fail to reliably identify non-U.S. citizens but will reliably identify and discriminate against \n12  naturalized U.S. citizens.  \n13  Harassing Investigations and Wrongful Prosecutions \n \n14  117.  HB 2492 and HB 2243 unlawfully subject eligible, registered voters to targeted \nharassment and criminal investigation and prosecution by the Intervenor-Defendant Attorney \n15 \nGeneral.  \n16 \n118.  HB 2492 requires the Defendant Secretary of State to provide the Intervenor-\n17 \nDefendant Attorney General with “a list of all individuals who are registered to vote and who have \n18 \nnot provided satisfactory evidence of citizenship” for the purpose of hunting among lawfully \n19 \nregistered voters searching for alleged noncitizens on the rolls. HB 2492 § 7 (to be codified at \n20 \nA.R.S. § 16-143).  \n21 \n22 \n  20 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 21 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  119.  HB 2243 likewise requires that county recorders refer to the county attorney or the \n2  Intervenor-Defendant Attorney General any voter whose registration is cancelled because the voter \nfailed to supply DPOC in response to the notice letter. Id.  \n3 \n120.  HB 2492 subjects these voters to harassment and criminal investigation under a \n4 \nvague and overbroad mandate that the Intervenor-Defendant Attorney General “use all available \n5 \nresources” to investigate and prosecute registered voters based on evidence that they are not U.S. \n6 \ncitizens, despite the fact that the identified resources do not have reliable or current data about U.S. \n7 \ncitizenship. Id.  \n8 \n121.  The “resources” HB 2492 lists as required references for Intervenor-Defendant \n9 \nAttorney General to check for U.S. citizenship data are the same notoriously unreliable databases \n10 \nidentified above known to contain outdated and faulty data that do not accurately reflect current \n11 \ncitizenship status.   \n12  122.  Using these outdated and inaccurate inputs or any other purported “available \n13  resources,” HB 2492 subjects these eligible voters to harassment and intimidation by Intervenor-\n14  Defendant Attorney General simply because they are naturalized rather than native-born U.S. \ncitizens and they exercised their fundamental right to register and vote.   \n15 \nHB 2492 and HB 2243 Impose Severe, Arbitrary, and Discriminatory Burdens \n16 \n \n123.  HB 2492’s and HB 2243’s severe and undue burdens fall disproportionately on \n17 \nvoters who have fewer resources, have less access to the tools and assistance necessary to comply \n18 \nwith the law’s many confusing and restrictive requirements, and who are more likely to have \n19 \nexperienced past and present discrimination.  \n20 \n21 \n22 \n  21 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 22 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  124.  Millions  of  Americans  lack  ready  access  to  documents  to  prove  their  U.S. \n2  citizenship. For example, statistics published by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Census \nBureau indicate that approximately 56% of Americans lack a valid U.S. passport.4  \n3 \n125.  A 2006 study showed that 5-6% of Americans lacked access to both a U.S. passport \n4 \nand a birth certificate.5 \n5 \n126.  DPOC requirements are particularly burdensome for elderly people, including \n6 \nAfrican Americans and Native Americans born during the era of de jure segregation, who may not \n7 \nhave been born in hospitals, and whose births may not have been officially recorded. \n8 \n127.  HB 2492 also imposes severe burdens on people who have changed their name, \n9 \nincluding through marriage. For example, the 2006 survey conducted by the Brennan Center for \n10 \nJustice demonstrated that as few as 48% of voting-age women with ready access to their birth \n11 \ncertificate have a birth certificate that reflects their current name, and only 66% of voting-age \n12  women have access to any form of DPOC reflecting their current name.6 \n13  128.  Low-income voters are particularly likely to lack access to DPOC and DPOR. For \n14  example, citizens earning less than $25,000 per year are more than twice as likely to lack access \nto DPOC than other Americans, and at least 12% of voting-age citizens who earn less than $25,000 \n15 \n16 \n \n17   \n4 The U.S. Census Bureau estimates U.S. population to be 331,893,745 as of July 1, 2021. \n18  US Quick Facts, US Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US (accessed July 17, \n2022).  According  to  the  U.S.  State  Department,  145,028,408  valid  U.S.  passports  were  in \ncirculation in 2021. Reports and Statistics, U.S. Dep’t of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, \n19 \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about-us/reports-and-statistics.html  (accessed  July  17,  2022).  The \nnumber of valid U.S. passports is approximately 44% of the estimated population of the United \n20 \nStates.  \n5 “Citizens Without Proof: A Survey of Americans’ Possession of Documentary Proof of \n21 \nCitizenship  and  Photo  Identification,”  Brennan  Center  for  Justice  (2006), \nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/d/download_file_39242.pdf. \n22  6 Id. \n  22 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 23 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  per year do not have a readily available U.S. passport, naturalization document, or birth certificate.7 \n2  Low-income voters are also more likely to move more frequently and have difficulty maintaining \nand providing DPOR.  \n3 \n129.  The burden imposed by DPOC requirements on low-income voters is compounded \n4 \nby the financial obstacles to obtaining DPOC. The cost to obtain or replace U.S. citizenship \n5 \ndocuments can be insurmountable for some Americans; a birth certificate can cost as much as $30 \n6 \nin fees, a first-time application for a passport card costs $55, plus the cost of photos, and a \n7 \nreplacement naturalization certificate costs $555.  \n8 \n130.  In addition to those fees, applicants for passports and birth certificates may need to \n9 \nobtain multiple additional documents to prove their U.S. citizenship or identity, which in turn \n10 \nrequire additional costs. In some instances, individuals must also bear the cost of traveling long \n11 \ndistances, and taking off or losing hours at work, to obtain citizenship documents. \n12  131.  Obtaining U.S. citizenship documents also takes time. The U.S. State Department \n13  estimates a processing time of eight to eleven weeks for a routine passport request, which costs \n14  between $65 and $195 for a new applicant, and five to seven weeks for an expedited request—\nwhich requires $60 in additional costs.8 Many states take several weeks to fulfill birth certificate \n15 \nrequests. For example, a mailed request for a birth certificate takes ten to twelve weeks to complete \n16 \nin New York and eight to ten weeks in Georgia. Those timelines can be expedited but doing so \n17 \n18 \n19 \n \n \n20 \n7 Id. \n8 Processing Times for U.S. Passports, U.S. Dep’t of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, \n21 \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html (accessed July 17, 2022); \nPassport  Fees,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  State  Bureau  of  Consular  Affairs, \n22  https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/fees.html (accessed July 17, 2022). \n  23 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 24 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  requires payment of an additional fee or travel to the relevant state—cost-prohibitive options that \n2  are not feasible for individuals who are struggling to afford the base fee to obtain a birth certificate.  \n132.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, more than \n3 \n3.2 million of Arizona’s approximately 7.1 million residents were born in a State other than \n4 \nArizona, and more than 428,000 are foreign-born naturalized U.S. citizens.9  \n5 \n133.  HB  2492’s  DPOC  and  DPOR  requirements  put  significant  strain  on  voter \n6 \nregistration work by state agencies and nonprofit civic organizations.  \n7 \n134.  Advocating for greater civic participation by conducting voter registration drives—\n8 \nactivity the NVRA affirmatively encourages, see 52 U.S.C. § 20505(b)—is costly in time and \n9 \nresources, and HB 2492 makes Plaintiffs voter registration work more difficult and advocacy less \n10 \neffective.  \n11 \n135.  Even those eligible Arizonans who do have access to the specified documents \n12  establishing their U.S. citizenship or their current residence often do not carry them to locations \n13  where civic organizations conduct voter registration drives.  \n14  136.  Civic organizations likewise cannot be expected to carry expensive equipment \nnecessary to scan those documents and attach them to completed voter registration applications in \n15 \norder to serve their mission participating in the voter registration process.  \n16 \nDiscrimination Against Eligible Native American Voters \n17 \n \n137.  HB 2492’s DPOR requirement targets Native  Americans of tribes located in \n18 \nArizona, particularly enrolled members who live on Reservations, giving them less opportunity \n19 \n \n20 \n \n9 American Community Survey 2020 5-Year Estimates Detailed Tables, B05002 – Place \n21 \nof  Birth  by  Nativity  and  Citizenship  Status, \nhttps://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Native%20Born%3ANative%20and%20Foreign%20Born%3APlace%20of%\n22  20Birth&g=0400000US04&tid=ACSDT5Y2020.B05002 (accessed July 17, 2022).  \n  24 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 25 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  than other eligible Arizona voters to participate in the political process and elect representatives of \n2  their choice.  \n138.  Because HB 2492 requires that voters provide documentary proof of residence as a \n3 \ncondition of registration, eligible voters who cannot satisfy the DPOR requirement will be unable \n4 \nto cast a ballot using any means of voting.  \n5 \n139.  The DPOR requirement will burden a substantial portion of the Native population \n6 \nin Arizona, and this burden will be unique when compared to other eligible Arizona voters.  \n7 \n140.  As described above, many enrolled members of tribes will be unable to provide \n8 \nDPOR because they live on Reservations or in other rural communities where homes lack \n9 \nnumbered street addresses and therefore have no method of obtaining a document containing their \n10 \nname and residential address, as required by HB 2492.  \n11 \n141.  Even where members of tribes live in a home that has a numbered street address, \n12  many  may  be  unable  to  provide  documentary  proof  of  that  address  due  to  their  living \n13  circumstances.  \n14  142.  For  instance,  Reservation  homes  may  house  extended  families  and  multiple \ngenerations.10 In a 2017 study, the Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that \n15 \nas many as 39 percent of Native households in Indian Country are extended family households.11 \n16 \nMoreover, many homes in Indian Country belonging to enrolled members of tribes—at least 16 \n17 \n18 \n \n19 \n \n10 See U.S. DEP’T OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, HOUSING NEEDS OF AMERICAN \n20 \nINDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES IN TRIBAL AREAS: A REPORT FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF AMERICAN \nINDIAN,  ALASKA  NATIVE,  AND  NATIVE  HAWAIIAN  HOUSING  NEEDS  77  (Jan.  2017), \n21 \nhttps://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/HNAIHousingNeeds.pdf  [hereinafter \n“HUD REPORT]. \n22  11 Id. \n  25 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 26 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  percent, according to one estimate—are considered “overcrowded” by the Department of Housing \n2  and Urban Development.12  \n143.  Individuals living in multi-generational, extended family, or many-member homes, \n3 \nmay not be listed on official documentation, and as a result may lack paperwork that can be used \n4 \nto satisfy the DPOR Requirement. These individuals will be forced to overcome substantial hurdles \n5 \nin order to obtain satisfactory DPOR. \n6 \n144.  Other enrolled members of tribes living on Reservations may be “near homeless,” \n7 \nor living temporarily with family members or other Tribal members in order to avoid being without \n8 \nhousing.13 The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that on average, 16.6 \n9 \npercent of households in Indian Country are sheltering an individual who has no other place to \n10 \nlive.14 Individuals experiencing “near homelessness” are often forced to move frequently15 and, \n11 \ngiven the short-term nature of their housing, are unlikely to be able to obtain documents that \n12  establish their place of residence. As a result, they may be prevented from registering to vote \n13  because they are unable to satisfy the DPOR Requirement. \n14  145.  Some homes on Reservations do not have running water, electricity, telephone, or \ninternet services, meaning that their residents may not have utility accounts and the documentation \n15 \nthat comes with them.16 Homes may also be in a condition that makes it difficult to maintain paper \n16 \ndocumentation.17 These barriers are far less common in homes outside of a tribe’s reservation, \n17 \nmeaning that they are disproportionately felt by Native Americans. \n18 \n \n19 \n \n12 Id. at 74. \n20 \n13 Id. at 79. \n14 Id. at 75. \n21  15 Id. at 80-81. \n16 See, e.g., HUD REPORT at 66-72. \n22  17 See id. \n  26 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 27 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  146.  Reservations commonly do not have residential mail services and many enrolled \n2  members of tribes either have no address or only have access to a post office box. Members \ncommonly share these post office boxes with others or frequently change their box numbers. \n3 \n147.  Together, these factors make obtaining DPOR burdensome or impossible for a \n4 \nsubstantial population of eligible Native voters and mean that the barriers to obtaining DPOR are \n5 \ndisproportionately felt by Native Americans, when compared to other Arizona residents. \n6 \n148.  HB 2492’s disproportionate burden on eligible Native voters was no accident. \n7 \n149.  The  discriminatory  DPOR  requirement  was  enacted  in  the  wake  of  widely \n8 \npublicized high turnout by Native voters in Arizona, which affected electoral outcomes in in the \n9 \n2020 Election.18   \n10 \n150.  In response to this increased political mobilization by Native voters, the Legislature \n11 \nsought to suppress the Native vote. \n12  151.  Lawmakers in Arizona have been on notice for years that conditioning voting or \n13  registering to vote on an individual’s ability to provide documentary proof of their residential \n14  address, as HB 2492 does, disproportionately burdens Native American voters. \n152.  In 2006, the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, the Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, \n15 \nindividual  enrolled  members,  and  others  sued  Arizona  officials  challenging  the  State’s \n16 \n17   \n \n18  18 See, e.g., Native American Voters Help Biden Take the State of Arizona, LATINO \nDECISIONS (Nov. 10, 2020), https://latinodecisions.com/blog/native-american-voters-help-biden-\ntake-the-state-of-arizona/?bbeml=tp-\n19 \npck9Q6QNPEiuBt3JmyTokQ.j_A449GHrZU6gsiXEwkkqjw.rhpa3D81JCk2FHErD8XV8wQ.lr\nuv5nT3v40qRlHmbW6ye_A; Anna V.

Amongst other issues, the Plaintiffs alleged that  the State’s photo \n2  identification law, A.R.S. § 16-579, which required voters to present identification that included \ntheir residential numbered street address, would disproportionately prevent Native Americans \n3 \nfrom voting. \n4 \n153.  In response to the lawsuit, the Secretary of State agreed to revise the State’s election \n5 \nprocedures to permit enrolled members to vote a regular provisional ballot upon providing a form \n6 \nof tribal identification that does not include a residential numbered street address. See Gonzalez v. \n7 \nArizona, CV 06-1268-PHX-ROS, Joint Stipulation, Doc. 749 (D. Ariz. Apr. 18, 2008). \n8 \n154.  The DPOR requirement in HB 2492 is directly tied to the law at issue in the 2006 \n9 \nvoter identification cases, A.R.S. § 16-579: a voter registration applicant may satisfy the DPOR \n10 \nrequirement only by providing identification that would be sufficient under that provision, A.R.S. \n11 \n§ 16-579, or by listing an Arizona Driver’s License or Nonoperating Identification number. \n12  155.  The 2006  lawsuit and  subsequent  accommodations for  enrolled members put \n13  Arizona lawmakers on notice that many Native voters would be unable to satisfy HB 2492’s DPOR \n14  requirement. \nDiscrimination Against Eligible Latino, Language Minority, and Other Voters of Color \n15 \n \n156.  HB 2492 and HB 2243 also disproportionately burden eligible Latino and language \n16 \nminority voters, giving them less opportunity than other eligible Arizona voters to participate in \n17 \nthe political process and elect representatives of their choice. \n18 \n157.  As described above, naturalized U.S. citizens will be disproportionately targeted by \n19 \nHB 2492 and HB 2243’s DPOC and Birthplace Requirements as well as their reliance on faulty \n20 \nand stale citizenship data to cancel, remove, and target eligible voters for criminal investigation.  \n21 \n22 \n  28 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 29 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  158.  In Arizona, the naturalized U.S. citizen population is primarily comprised of voters \n2  of color and voters who speak English as a second language. According to the 2020 5-year \nAmerican Community Survey, approximately 428,788 naturalized citizens reside in Arizona. Over \n3 \nhalf of those potential voters were born in Latin America. Over 100,000 of those potential voters \n4 \nwere born in Asia. And an estimated 19,304 of those voters were born in Africa. Over three-\n5 \nquarters of the naturalized U.S. citizen population in Arizona identifies as non-white and/or \n6 \nHispanic or Latino.  \n7 \n159.  Moreover, many naturalized U.S. citizens in Arizona speak English as a second \n8 \nlanguage. Over seventy-five percent of naturalized U.S. citizens in Arizona speak a language other \n9 \nthan English at home and over one-third report speaking English less than “very well.” \n10 \n160.  By discriminating against naturalized citizen voters, HB 2492 and HB 2243 will \n11 \ndisproportionately burden voters and voter registration applicants of color, particularly Latino \n12  voters, as well as voters and voter registration applicants from language minority communities. \n13  Totality of Circumstances \n14  161.  HB 2492 and HB 2243 were enacted against a background of persistent and \npervasive  discrimination  against  Native  Americans,  Latinos,  voters  of  color,  and  language \n15 \nminority communities in Arizona, including in voting. \n16 \n162.  The history of discrimination against Native Americans, Latinos, voters of color \n17 \nand members of language minority communities in Arizona is well documented.  \n18 \n163.  From November 1, 1972, until June 25, 2013, when the Supreme Court decided \n19 \nShelby County v. Holder, the State of Arizona was subject to the preclearance provisions of Section \n20 \n5 of the Voting Rights Act because of its use of voting practices that disproportionately burdened \n21 \n22 \n  29 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 30 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  members of language minority communities.19 Apache, Navajo, and Coconino Counties were also \n2  historically covered.20 \n164.  Official barriers to Native Americans’ ability to register to vote persisted in Arizona \n3 \nuntil 1948. See Harrison v. Laveen, 196 P.2d 456 (Ariz. 1984). Once Native Americans became \n4 \nUnited States citizens pursuant to the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, a number of localities in \n5 \nArizona continued to reject Native Americans’ voter registration applications.21 Some advanced \n6 \nthe theory that living on a reservation made enrolled members non-residents of the state.22 Others \n7 \nalleged that Supreme Court caselaw supposedly made Native Americans “wards” of the United \n8 \nStates and therefore ineligible to vote under the Arizona constitutional provision barring persons \n9 \n“under guardianship” from casting a ballot.23 \n10 \n165.  The policy of rejecting Native American voter registrants living on reservations \n11 \nbecame official statewide in 1928 when the Arizona Supreme Court adopted the guardianship \n12  theory. The policy was extended in practice and later officially by the Attorney General to all \n13  Native Americans, including those living outside of Reservations.24 Native Americans only won \n14  the right to vote in Arizona after a lawsuit filed by Native veterans who returned home after serving \nthe United States in World War II and had their voter registrations denied.25 \n15 \n16 \n \n17   \n19 See Jurisdictions Previously Covered by Section 5, U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE (Nov. 29, \n2021), https://www.justice.gov/crt/jurisdictions-previously-covered-section-5. \n18 \n20 Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, The History of Indian Voting Rights in Arizona: Overcoming \nDecades of Voter Suppression, 47 Ariz.

Even after ostensibly granting the right to vote to Native Americans, the State of \n2  Arizona and its localities continued to enact laws and employ practices that had both the aim and \neffect of disenfranchising Native Americans. \n3 \n167.  Until the 1970’s, Arizona used literacy tests to block Native Americans, Latinos, \n4 \nand other voters of color from casting a ballot.26 \n5 \n168.  Shortly after Arizona’s literacy tests were invalidated by the VRA, Apache County \n6 \neliminated almost half of the polling places on lands located within tribes’ reservations within the \n7 \ncounty in a bid to suppress turnout by enrolled members in an election to fund a new segregated \n8 \nschool in the county.27 Three counties with large populations of Native Americans entered into a \n9 \nconsent decree with the United States after the Department of Justice sued Arizona under the \n10 \nVoting Rights Act for denying and abridging the voting rights of Navajo Citizens. See United \n11 \nStates v. Arizona, No. 88-1989 (D. Ariz. May 22, 1989) (consent decree) (as amended Sept. 7, \n12  1993). The consent decree was later modified due to continued noncompliance by the counties.28 \n13  Two of those counties later attempted to hold judicial elections without obtaining preclearance, as \n14  required by the Voting Rights Act.29 \n169.  Voting discrimination against Native Americans in Arizona has persisted into this \n15 \ncentury. In 2004, Arizona enacted a voter identification law that, as noted above, failed to account \n16 \nfor the lack of numbered street addresses on many reservations.30 Arizona counties have also \n17 \n18 \n \n \n19 \n26 See Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 153 (1970); Ferguson-Bohnee, supra note 17 at \n1112. \n20 \n27 See id. at 1117. \n28 See James Thomas Tucker, et al., Voting Rights in Arizona: 1982-2006, 17:2 Rev. of L. \n21 \nand Soc.

The State and its localities have also consistently attempted to dilute Native voting \n3 \npower through malapportionment, failures to draw majority-minority districts that are required by \n4 \nfederal law, and tools like at-large elections designed to quash minority voting power.32 See, e.g., \n5 \nGoodluck v. Apache Cnty., 417 F. Supp. 13 (D. Ariz. 1975), aff'd sub nom. Apache Cnty. v. United \n6 \nStates, 429 U.S. 876 (1976); Goddard v. Babbitt, 536 F. Supp. 538, 541 (D. Ariz. 1982) (finding \n7 \nthat the division of the San Carlos Apache Reservation into three state legislative and three \n8 \ncongressional districts was unnecessary to achieve traditional redistricting principles and “ha[d] \n9 \nthe effect of diluting the San Carlos Apache Tribal voting strength and dividing the Apache \n10 \ncommunity of interest” and requiring new plans). \n11 \n171.  Native Americans in Arizona continue to bear the effects of discrimination in areas \n12  such as education, employment, health, and economic outcomes, further hindering their ability to \n13  participate in the democratic process. \n14  172.  Native Americans have the highest poverty rate amongst persons of any race or \nethnicity in Arizona and live in poverty at a rate more than double that of the overall population \n15 \nand more than three times that of white Arizonans. Specifically, 31.5 percent of Native American \n16 \nresidents of Arizona live in a household with an income falling below the poverty line, compared \n17 \nto 14.1 percent in the overall population, and 9.6 percent of white residents. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n \n \n21  31  See  JAMES  THOMAS  TUCKER,  JACQUELINE  DE  LEÓN,  AND  DAN  MCCOOL,  NATIVE \nAMERICAN RIGHTS FUND, OBSTACLES AT EVERY TURN 61-62 (2020). \n22  32 See Ferguson-Bohnee, supra note 17 at 1118-21. \n  32 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 33 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  173.  Native Americans similarly have the lowest median household income compared \n2  to any other race or ethnicity in Arizona. According to the 2020 American Community Survey, \nthe median household income amongst Native Americans is $39,969, compared to $61,529 in the \n3 \ntotal population and $66,973 amongst white Arizonans.  \n4 \n174.  Native Americans in Arizona also experience the effects of discrimination in \n5 \neducational attainment. While 94.8 percent of white residents of Arizona aged 25 and older have \n6 \nattained a high school diploma, only 78.1 percent of Native Americans of the same age have \n7 \ncompleted high school or the equivalent. The disparity is even greater in postsecondary education, \n8 \nwith only 10.9 percent of Native Americans having a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to \n9 \n36.6 percent of white Arizonans. \n10 \n175.  Native Americans are unemployed at a rate substantially higher than the overall \n11 \npopulation, with an unemployment rate of 12.8 percent, compared to only 5.8 percent amongst the \n12  overall population and 5.0 percent amongst white Arizonans. \n13  176.  Enrolled members living on Reservations often do not own or have access to a \n14  reliable vehicle. Indeed, Native Americans are far more likely not to have access to a vehicle than \nthe overall population in Arizona. While only 6.0 percent households of any race in Arizona and \n15 \n5.6 percent of white households do not have a vehicle available, 19.7 percent of Native households \n16 \nlack access to a vehicle.  \n17 \n177.  Together, these factors exacerbate the barriers imposed on Native Americans by \n18 \nHB 2492. \n19 \n178.  There is a similarly long history of official discrimination against eligible Latino \n20 \nvoters in Arizona. \n21 \n22 \n  33 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 34 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  179.  Like Native Americans, Latinos were commonly prevented from voting through \n2  the 1970’s by the State’s literacy test. In enacting the pre-statehood literacy test in 1909, legislators \nmade it clear that discriminating against Latino voters was one of the express goals of the test. One \n3 \nlegislator even remarked that the test’s purpose was to block the “ignorant Mexican vote.”33 The \n4 \ntest was administered in a manner that allowed white applicants to easily pass or be excused \n5 \naltogether, while Latinos were expected to pass the test without error.34 \n6 \n180.  The obstacles faced by Arizona’s Latino and Spanish-speaking communities have \n7 \nbeen exacerbated by Arizona’s persistently discriminatory education policies. In 1988, the Arizona \n8 \nConstitution  was  amended  by  ballot  initiative  to  require  that  “[t]he  State  and  all  political \n9 \nsubdivisions of [the] State shall act in English and in no other language.” Yniguez v. Arizonans for \n10 \nOfficial English, 69 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 1995) (en banc), vacated sub nom. Arizonans for \n11 \nOfficial English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43 (1997). The English-only requirement was invalidated by \n12  the Arizona Supreme Court as unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, in \n13  part because of its dramatically negative impact on political participation by language minorities. \n14  Ruiz v. Hull, 957 P.2d 984, 998, 1000 (Ariz. 1998).  \n181.  Intimidation and efforts to block Latino voters persist into this century. In 2004, \n15 \nArizona enacted Proposition 200, which, in addition to establishing the DPOC requirement for \n16 \nvoter registration at issue in Gonzales and Arizona Inter Tribal Council, also imposed similarly \n17 \nburdensome and discriminatory DPOC requirements for certain state and local public benefits. \n18 \n19 \n \n \n20 \n33 Grace Oldham, Arizona Has Suppressed Black, Latino, and Native American Voters for \nMore  than  a  Century,  ARIZONA  REPUBLIC  (Sep.  13,  2020), \n21 \nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/09/13/arizonas-history-suppressing-\nblack-latino-native-american-voters/5771359002/. \n22  34 Id. \n  34 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 35 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  182.  Arizona jurisdictions have continued to fail to provide adequate language services \n2  to Latino voters who have limited English proficiency. In 2012, for example, Maricopa County’s \nSpanish-language voter pamphlet listed the wrong date for the election. The English-language \n3 \nversion did not contain the same mistake.35 Spanish-language voting materials also frequently \n4 \ncontain misrepresentations and mistranslations.36 \n5 \n183.  Latinos in Arizona continue to bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as \n6 \neducation,  employment,  health,  and  economic  outcomes,  further  hindering  their  ability  to \n7 \nparticipate in the democratic process. \n8 \n184.  Latinos in Arizona have a higher poverty rate compared to the overall population, \n9 \nand more than twice that of white Arizonans. Specifically, 19.2 percent of Latinos live in a \n10 \nhousehold with an income falling below the poverty line, compared to only 9.6 percent of white \n11 \nArizonans and 14.1 percent of the overall population. \n12  185.  The median household income amongst Latinos in Arizona also falls below the \n13  median household income statewide. According to the 2020 American Community Survey, the \n14  median household income amongst the Latino population in Arizona is $52,399, compared to \n$61,529 in the total population and $66,973 amongst white Arizonans. \n15 \n186.  Latinos in Arizona face greater disparities than white Arizonans in education. Only \n16 \n71.7 percent of Latinos in Arizona have received a high school diploma or the equivalent, \n17 \ncompared to 94.8 percent of the white population. The disparity is similar in postsecondary \n18 \neducation, with only 14.3 percent of Latinos having a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to \n19 \n36.6 percent of white Arizonans. \n20 \n \n21 \n \n35 Id. \n22  36 Id. \n  35 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 36 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  187.  Latinos are unemployed at a rate higher than the overall population, with an \n2  unemployment rate of 6.2 percent, compared to only 5.8 percent amongst the overall population \nand 5.0 percent amongst white Arizonans. \n3 \n188.  Latinos are likewise far more likely not to have access to a vehicle than the overall \n4 \npopulation in Arizona. While only 6.0 percent households of any race in Arizona and 5.6 percent \n5 \nof white households do not have a vehicle available, 11.2 percent of Latino households lack access \n6 \nto a vehicle.  \n7 \n189.  Together, these factors exacerbate the barriers imposed on Latinos and members of \n8 \nlanguage minority communities by HB 2492 and HB 2243. \n9 \n190.  The  DPOR  Requirement,  DPOC  procedures,  and  Birthplace  Requirement \n10 \nprovisions enshrined in HB 2492 and HB 2243 are novel practices that were not commonly in \n11 \nplace at the time of the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or its amendments. In particular, \n12  Arizona law did not contain any of these requirements at the time.  \n13  191.  Because barriers posed by these requirements affect an eligible voter’s ability to \n14  register to vote and remain registered, affected individuals will be barred from voting using any \nmeans. HB 2492 and 2243 render Arizona’s entire system of voting is inaccessible to eligible \n15 \nvoters impacted by the new laws. \n16 \nHB 2492 and 2493 Do Not Serve Any Legitimate Governmental Purpose \n17 \n192.  HB 2492 and HB 2243 impose a host of severe, unnecessary, and discriminatory \n18 \nburdens on Arizona voters at both the registration and voting stages.  \n19 \n193.  HB 2492 and HB 2243’s burdensome, arbitrary, and discriminatory provisions \n20 \nserve no meaningful or legitimate governmental purpose.  \n21 \n22 \n  36 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 37 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  194.  The intent to discriminate against Native voters, naturalized U.S. citizens, Latino \n2  voters, and members of language minority communities is not a legitimate governmental purpose.  \n195.  The State has not and cannot offer a rational, or much less strong, interest that is \n3 \nserved by the DPOR requirement.  \n4 \n196.  Arizona’s election procedures already accommodate voters who lack numbered \n5 \nstreet addresses by, for example, permitting voter registration applicants to register using a \n6 \ndescription of where they live rather than an address and permitting Native Americans to cast a \n7 \nballot using tribal identification that does not include a residential address. The DPOR requirement \n8 \ndoes not offer such accommodations, and its failure to do so is not supported by any rational or \n9 \nstrong state interest. \n10 \n197.  Nor can the State identify a rational  or strong interest  served by the DPOC \n11 \nRequirement, Birthplace Requirement, Checkmark Requirement, or the mandated use of outdated \n12  and incorrect citizenship data to reject voter registration applications and purge eligible voters \n13  from the rolls. \n14  198.  There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud or non-U.S. citizen voting in \nArizona. To the extent there is a perception that Arizona suffers from widespread voting fraud or \n15 \nnon-U.S. citizen voting in Arizona, the passage of bills like HB 2492 and HB 2243 are intended \n16 \nto and succeed in furthering that misperception. \n17 \n199.  Despite fourteen different post-election lawsuits in Arizona state and federal courts \n18 \npurportedly challenging the validity of the 2020 election, courts unanimously concluded that the \n19 \nelection conspiracists who brought these challenges failed to “establish any degree of fraud” in \n20 \nArizona’s elections. Ward v. Jackson, No. CV-20-0343-AP/EL, 2020 WL 8617817, at *2 (Ariz. \n21 \n22 \n  37 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 38 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  Dec. 8, 2020), cert. denied, 141 S.

Since 2020, Arizona’s elections have come under tremendous scrutiny in various \n3 \nofficial and unofficial audits, but none of these reviews have surfaced legitimate claims of \n4 \nwidespread fraud or non-U.S. citizens voting in Arizona elections because no such fraud exists.37 \n5 \n201.  In sworn testimony before Congress, Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers has \n6 \ndenied the widespread but false allegations that Arizona’s election outcomes were affected by \n7 \nfraud or were otherwise illegitimate.38 \n8 \n202.  Despite the lack of any evidence to substantiate their claims, various actors—\n9 \nincluding state elected officials such as HB 2492 sponsor Representative Jake Hoffman—have \n10 \ncontinued to make allegations that Arizona’s elections suffer from fraud and non-U.S. citizen \n11 \nvoters. These allegations are intended to undermine voter confidence in the electoral process, vilify \n12  naturalized citizens and voters of color, justify restricting access to voter registration and voting, \n13  and further the misconception that the 2020 election was stolen. They are not intended to be a \n14  factual representation about the state of elections in Arizona.  \n203.  Instead of advancing any legitimate purpose, HB 2492 and HB 2243 were enacted \n15 \nto serve a political advantage and further the misconception that the 2020 election was stolen.  \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n \n \n20 \n37 See, e.g., Maricopa County Elections Department, Elections Information: Just the Facts, \nhttps://elections.maricopa.gov/voting/just-the-facts.html.  \n21  38 See Here’s every word from the fourth Jan. 6 committee hearing on its investigation, \nNPR  (June  21,  2022),  https://www.npr.org/2022/06/21/1105848096/jan-6-committee-hearing-\n22  transcript. \n  38 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 39 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  204.  The restrictions imposed by HB 2492 and HB 2243 will not enhance electoral \n2  security. Instead, they will make voter registration rolls less reliable, and will undermine the \npublic’s confidence in Arizona’s elections.  \n3 \n205.  Some voters will see HB 2492 and HB 2243 as legitimizing otherwise baseless \n4 \nclaims about voter fraud and non-U.S. citizen voting—problems that Arizona does not have. Other \n5 \nvoters will understand HB  2492 and HB 2243 as intended to discriminate against naturalized \n6 \ncitizens and Native American voters and make it more difficult for certain eligible voters to \n7 \nparticipate in the electoral process. The end result will be that voters in Arizona will have less \n8 \nconfidence in the electoral process.  \n9 \n206.  Rather than providing election officials with reliable means to identify ineligible \n10 \nvoters, the new law will instead make it more difficult for eligible Arizonans to register and vote. \n11 \nThe burdens will most heavily burden naturalized U.S. citizens, enrolled members of tribes, \n12  college and university students, low-income voters, elderly voters, racial and ethnic minorities, \n13  voters who move frequently, and voters who have changed their legal name such as married \n14  women.  \n207.  The legislature enacted HB 2492 knowing that aspects of the bill violate federal \n15 \nlaw.  \n16 \n208.  For example, before debating the bill in the House Rules Committee on February \n17 \n22, 2022, nonpartisan legal staff for the House Rules Committee warned that the proposed \n18 \ndocumentary proof of citizenship requirement would violate federal law.39 \n19 \n20 \n \n21 \n \n39  Arizona  State  Legislature,  02/22/2022  –  House  Rules, \n22  https://www.azleg.gov/videoplayer/?eventID=2022021121&startStreamAt=451.  \n  39 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 40 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  209.  Undeterred, the House Rules Committee voted to approve HB 2492. In explaining \n2  his vote, Chair of the House Rules Committee and House Speaker Pro Tempore Travis Grantham \nasserted that he “strongly reject[ed] th[e] notion” that the federal government has the authority to \n3 \ninvalidate Arizona’s past efforts to impose DPOC requirements for violating federal law and stated \n4 \nthat rebuking that precedent by enacting HB 2492 would be “a fight worth having” in court.40 \n5 \nPARTIES \n6   \nPlaintiffs \n7   \n    Living United for Change in Arizona  \n8   \n210. Living United for Change in Arizona (“LUCHA”) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit \n9 \nmembership organization based in Arizona. It is led by community members fighting for social, \n10 \nracial, and economic justice.  \n11 \n211. LUCHA advocates on behalf of approximately 2,000 dues-paying members and an \n12  additional approximately 93,000 supporters in Arizona. \n13  212. HB 2492 will negatively affect LUCHA’s members and supporters many of whom \n14  are people of color, low income, students, and/or elderly voters, and are therefore significantly \nmore likely to lack the required documentation under HB 2492.  \n15 \n213. LUCHA’s membership also consists of naturalized U.S. citizens who will be \n16 \ntargeted for specific classifications and disfavored treatment under the requirements and processes \n17 \nestablished in HB 2492 and HB 2243.  \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21   \n \n40 Id.  \n22 \n  40 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 41 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  214. In advance of the 2020 election, LUCHA organized both in-person and virtual voter \n2  registration drives and educated voters about important deadlines, how voters could exercise and \nprotect their right to vote, and issues and candidates on the ballot.  \n3 \n215. LUCHA plans to conduct the same voter registration and education activities for \n4 \nfuture elections. However, as a result of the requirements imposed by HB 2492, LUCHA must \n5 \ndivert money, personnel, time, and resources away from other activities. Specifically, LUCHA \n6 \nmust divert its scarce resources toward efforts to ensure that voters, particularly those who are low \n7 \nincome, can navigate the DPOC, DPOR, birthplace, and checkmark requirements mandated by \n8 \nHB 2492 and can obtain the necessary documentation to comply with the many changes in law.  \n9 \n216. LUCHA will spend more time training volunteers to educate voters about these new \n10 \nrestrictions, create additional digital voter education campaigns to combat misinformation about \n11 \nthese  requirements,  and  conduct  additional  outreach  to  Spanish-speaking,  Tribal,  and  rural \n12  communities to ensure that these efforts are effective. These diversions will continue to occur until \n13  the 2022 election and beyond for as long as these requirements are in effect.  \n14  217. HB 2492’s disparate treatment of otherwise eligible voters based on whether they \nlist their birthplace, check the citizenship box, and are able to provide DPOC and DPOR means \n15 \nthat LUCHA’s voter registration drive organizers must take additional time and training to inform \n16 \nvoters  of  the  many  new  changes  in  the  law  and  the  threats  of  criminal  investigation  and \n17 \nprosecution. \n18 \n218. When one of LUCHA’s members or assisted voters lack DPOC or DPOR, they will \n19 \nbe ineligible to register and/or to vote under HB 2492’s eligibility requirements.  \n20 \n219. LUCHA expects that many of its members and the community members that it \n21 \nseeks to register to vote will be intimidated and discouraged from registering to vote, even though \n22 \n  41 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 42 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  they are eligible, because of the unconstitutional limits imposed on the exercise of their franchise \n2  by HB 2492 and HB 2243.  \n220. Because LUCHA conducts voter registration drives at community events with the \n3 \ngoal of completing voter registrations on-site, potential LUCHA members and voters who do not \n4 \nhave Arizona drivers’ licenses and/or do not have DPOC or DPOR with them cannot fully \n5 \nparticipate.  \n6 \n221. Even if applicants happen to have DPOC or DPOR at a LUCHA voter registration \n7 \ndrive, LUCHA must now incur costs and additional burdens to purchase and maintain mobile \n8 \nscanning and printing equipment to facilitate voter registration applications that comply with HB \n9 \n2492.  \n10 \n222. As a result of  Defendant’s enforcement of the unconstitutional  and unlawful \n11 \nprovisions of HB 2492, LUCHA will be overburdened and unable to conduct successful voter \n12  registration drives; LUCHA will be forced to dedicate more resources and time in order to register \n13  the same number of members and voters; LUCHA will incur costs to purchase and maintain \n14  equipment to ensure its voter registration advocacy complies with HB 2492; and fewer LUCHA \nmembers and voters LUCHA reaches will be able to successfully register to vote and then cast a \n15 \nballot in all elections for which they are eligible. \n16 \n223. HB 2243’s requirement that election officials purge eligible voters from the voter \n17 \nregistration rolls based on outdated and incorrect data will disproportionately affect LUCHA’s \n18 \nmembers who are naturalized U.S. citizens, \n19 \n224. LUCHA will be forced to divert additional resources to educating its naturalized \n20 \nU.S. citizen members about the threat of removal from the voter registration rolls under HB 2243 \n21 \n22 \n  42 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 43 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  and assisting members who are threatened with removal in complying with notice letters and \n2  ensuring these members remain registered to vote. \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens  \n3 \n \n225. Plaintiff League of United Latin American Citizens (“LULAC”) is the Arizona-\n4 \nbased branch of the nation’s oldest and largest national Latino civil rights organization. LULAC \n5 \nis a nonpartisan, nonprofit membership organization with a presence in most of the fifty states, \n6 \nincluding  Arizona.  Founded  in  1929,  LULAC  works  to  advance  the  economic  condition, \n7 \neducational attainment, political influence, health, and civil rights, including voting rights, of the \n8 \nHispanic population of the United States.  \n9 \n226. LULAC members live across the State. LULAC has local councils throughout \n10 \nArizona, including in Phoenix, San Luis, Tucson, Tempe, Yuma, and other smaller communities. \n11 \n227. LULAC’s  members in  Arizona include naturalized U.S. citizens, low-income \n12  voters, students, and voters who move frequently or have changed their name.  \n13  228. LULAC’s members in Arizona are adversely affected by the undue burdens HB \n14  2492’s policies place on eligible Arizona citizens. Over 400,000 eligible Latino citizens in \nArizona, or nearly half of eligible Latinos in Arizona, are not currently registered to vote.  \n15 \n229. Voter  registration  activity  is  key  to  LULAC’s  mission  of  increasing  civic \n16 \nparticipation of its members and Arizona voters. LULAC has committed and continues to commit \n17 \ntime and resources to voter registration drives in Arizona.  \n18 \n230. Due  to  the  burdensome  and  confusing  restrictions  on  voting  and  registration \n19 \neligibility and processes imposed by HB 2492 and 2243, LULAC will be forced to divert its \n20 \nresources from its other programs supporting its mission. These bills will force LULAC to redirect \n21 \n22 \n  43 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 44 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  scarce funding to help voters comply with the new requirements. These diversions will continue \n2  to occur until the 2022 election and beyond for as long as these requirements are in effect. \n231. HB 2492’s disparate treatment of otherwise eligible voters based on whether they \n3 \nlist their birthplace, check the citizenship box, and are able to provide DPOC and DPOR means \n4 \nthat voter registration drive organizers must inform voters of the many new changes in the law and \n5 \nthe threats of criminal investigation and prosecution.  \n6 \n232. When one of LULAC’s members or assisted voters in Arizona lack DPOC or \n7 \nDPOR, they will be denied the right to register and the right to vote under HB 2492’s eligibility \n8 \nrequirements.  \n9 \n233. LULAC expects that many of its members and the community members that it \n10 \nseeks to register to vote will be intimidated and discouraged from registering to vote, even though \n11 \nthey are eligible, because of the unconstitutional limits imposed on the exercise of their franchise \n12  by HB 2492 and 2443.   \n13  234. Since LULAC conducts voter registration drives on-site in communities with the \n14  goal of completing voter registrations on-site, potential voters who do not have Arizona drivers’ \nlicenses and/or do not have DPOC or DPOR with them cannot fully participate.  \n15 \n235. Even if applicants happen to have DPOC or DPOR at a LULAC voter registration \n16 \ndrive, LULAC must now incur costs and additional burdens to purchase and maintain mobile \n17 \nscanning and printing equipment to facilitate voter registration applications that comply with HB \n18 \n2492.  \n19 \n236. As a result of  Defendant’s enforcement of the unconstitutional  and unlawful \n20 \nprovisions of HB 2492, LULAC will be overburdened and unable to conduct successful voter \n21 \nregistration drives; LULAC must dedicate and divert more resources and time in order to register \n22 \n  44 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 45 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  the same number of members and voters; LULAC will incur costs to purchase and maintain \n2  equipment to ensure its voter registration advocacy complies with HB 2492; and fewer LULAC \nmembers and voters LULAC reaches will be able to successfully register to vote and then cast a \n3 \nballot in all elections for which they are eligible. \n4 \n237. HB 2243’s requirement that election officials purge eligible voters from the voter \n5 \nregistration rolls based on outdated and incorrect data will disproportionately affect LULAC’s \n6 \nmembers and community members who are naturalized U.S. citizens. \n7 \n238. LULAC will be forced to divert additional resources to educating its naturalized \n8 \nU.S. citizen members and the communities it serves about the threat of removal from the voter \n9 \nregistration rolls under HB 2243 and assisting those voters who are threatened with removal in \n10 \ncomplying with notice letters and ensuring these members remain registered to vote. \n11 \n  Arizona Students’ Association \n \n12  239. Plaintiff  Arizona  Students’  Association  (“ASA”)  is  a  nonpartisan,  nonprofit \n13  membership organization based in Arizona. ASA is student led and represents the collective \n14  interest of the over 140,000 university students and over 400,000 community college students in \nArizona. The organization advocates at the local, state, and national levels for the interests of \n15 \nstudents. As a part of its mission, ASA encourages students throughout Arizona to register to vote \n16 \nthrough  voter  registration  activity.  ASA  has  committed  and  continues  to  commit time  and \n17 \npersonnel to voter registration drives in Arizona. \n18 \n240. ASA’s  members,  students  of  numerous  backgrounds  throughout  Arizona,  are \n19 \nacutely harmed by the undue burdens HB 2492 and HB 2243 impose on eligible Arizona citizens. \n20 \nMany students are young adults who are just becoming eligible to vote and therefore must register \n21 \nfor the first time. Students in Arizona living on campuses often do not have easy access to their \n22 \n  45 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 46 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  birth  certificates  or  other  underlying  citizenship  documentation.  Students  in  Arizona  move \n2  frequently and have less access to documents proving their place of residence.  \n241. Many students eligible to vote in Arizona have out-of-state driver’s licenses that do \n3 \nnot meet the statutory DPOC and DPOR requirements. Many other students cannot afford to pay \n4 \nfor state IDs or drivers’ licenses.  \n5 \n242. ASA has regularly conducted and will continue to conduct voter registration drives \n6 \nin Arizona as a core part of ASA’s mission. These voter registration drives focus on registering \n7 \nstudents, many of whom are first time voters and unfamiliar with the voter registration system. \n8 \nASA conducts its voter registration drives on school sites throughout Arizona.  \n9 \n243. Due to HB 2492’s burdensome and confusing restrictions on voting and registration \n10 \neligibility and processes, ASA will be forced to divert its resources from its other programs \n11 \nsupporting its mission. HB 2492 will force ASA to redirect scarce funding to purchase additional \n12  equipment and educational materials to help voters comply with the new voting and registration \n13  scheme, and to commit further staff and volunteer time and training to help guide voters through \n14  the additional requirements. These diversions will continue to occur until the 2022 election and \nbeyond for as long as these requirements are in effect. \n15 \n244. HB 2492’s disparate treatment of otherwise eligible voters based on whether they \n16 \nlist their birthplace, check the citizenship box, and are able to provide DPOC and DPOR means \n17 \nthat voter registration drive organizers must inform voters of the many new changes in the law and \n18 \nthe threats of criminal investigation and prosecution. \n19 \n245. When one of ASA’s members or assisted voters lack DPOC or DPOR, they will be \n20 \nineligible to register and to vote under HB 2492’s eligibility requirements. \n21 \n22 \n  46 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 47 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  246. Moreover, because the removal provisions set forth in HB 2243 direct county \n2  election officials to conduct monthly voter purges based on outdated information, ASA will be \nforced to divert resources to ensuring that its members, once registered, are not removed from the \n3 \nrolls.  \n4 \n247.  ASA expects that many of its members and the community members that it seeks \n5 \nto register to vote will be intimidated and discouraged from registering to vote, even though they \n6 \nare eligible, because of the unconstitutional limits imposed on the exercise of their franchise by \n7 \nHB 2492 and HB 2243.  \n8 \n248. Because  ASA  conducts  voter  registration  drives  at  schools  with  the  goal  of \n9 \ncompleting voter registrations on-site, potential ASA members and voters who do not have \n10 \nArizona drivers’ licenses and/or do not have DPOC or DPOR with them cannot fully participate.  \n11 \n249.

These diversions \n6 \nwill continue to occur until the 2022 election and beyond for as long as these requirements are in \n7 \neffect. \n8 \nInter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. \n \n9 \n254. The Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (“ITCA”) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit inter-\n10 \ntribal consortium of 21 federally recognized Indian Tribes with lands located across the State of \n11 \nArizona, and whose lands extend into the States of California, New Mexico, and Utah.  \n12  255. The 21 Member Tribes that comprise ITCA are the Ak-Chin Indian Community, \n13  Cocopah Tribe, Colorado River Indian Tribes, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Fort Mojave Tribe, \n14  Gila River Indian Community, Havasupai Tribe, Hopi Tribe, Hualapai Tribe, Kaibab Band of \nPaiute Indians, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Pueblo of Zuni, Quechan Tribe, Salt River Pima-Maricopa \n15 \nIndian Community, San Carlos Apache Tribe, Tohono O’odham Nation, Tonto Apache Tribe, \n16 \nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe, Yavapai-Apache Nation, and Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe. \n17 \n256. ITCA’s representatives are the highest elected officials from each Tribal Nation, \n18 \nincluding chairpersons, governors, and presidents. Its members include citizens of the consortium \n19 \nof the 21 federally recognized Indian Tribes.  \n20 \n257. Since 1952, ITCA’s Member Tribes have worked together as the Inter Tribal \n21 \nCouncil of Arizona to advocate for regional, state, and national issues affecting Tribes.  \n22 \n  49 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 50 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  258. ITCA’s Member Tribes have the authority to act to further their collective interests \n2  as sovereign Tribal governments. ITCA has the charge to support and represent particular Member \nTribes on matters directly affecting them. \n3 \n259. ITCA works to address the historical and modern barriers members of ITCA's \n4 \nMember Tribes face when attempting to access the ballot and provides non-partisan support for \n5 \nNative American voter engagement and participation in local, state, and federal elections. ITCA’s \n6 \nMember Tribes have consistently dedicated time and resources to protect the right to vote.  \n7 \n260.  Since 1975,  ITCA has  engaged Tribal citizens, who primarily live on Tribal \n8 \nreservation lands, through five key areas of civic engagement: 1) Voter Registration, 2) Voter \n9 \nEducation, 3) Candidate Education, 4) Get-Out-the-Vote (GOTV), and 5) Election Protection. \n10 \nThrough these five key areas, ITCA conducts voter registration drives, provides voter outreach \n11 \nand education specifically targeting young/new voters, produces and distributes voter guides, \n12  coordinates phone banking and other GOTV activities, and recruits and mobilizes volunteers to \n13  provide voter assistance on election day. \n14  261.  Due to HB 2492’s burdensome and confusing restrictions on voting and registration \neligibility and processes, ITCA will be forced to divert its resources from its other voting-related \n15 \nprograms supporting its mission. HB 2492 will force ITCA and ITCA Member Tribes to redirect \n16 \nscarce funding to purchase additional equipment and educational materials to assist Tribal citizens \n17 \nwith compliance with the new voting and registration scheme, and to commit further staff and \n18 \nvolunteer time and training to help Tribal citizens through the additional requirements. These \n19 \ndiversions  will  continue  to  occur  until  the  2022  election  and  beyond  for  as  long  as  these \n20 \nrequirements are in effect. \n21 \n22 \n  50 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 51 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  262.  HB 2492’s disparate treatment of otherwise eligible voters based on whether they \n2  are able to provide DPOC and DPOR, check the citizenship box, and attest to birthplace means \nthat voter registration drive organizers must inform voters of the many new changes in the law and \n3 \nthe threats of criminal investigation and prosecution. \n4 \n263.  Because ITCA and Member Tribes conduct voter registration drives on reservations \n5 \nwith the goal of completing voter registrations on-site, Tribal citizens who do not have Arizona \n6 \ndrivers’ licenses and/or do not have DPOC or DPOR with them cannot fully participate.  \n7 \n264.  Even if applicants happen to have DPOC or DPOR at an ITCA or Member Tribe \n8 \nvoter registration drive, ITCA or its Member Tribes must now incur costs and additional burdens \n9 \nto purchase and maintain mobile scanning and printing equipment to facilitate voter registration \n10 \napplications that comply with HB 2492.  \n11 \n265.  This will be particularly burdensome on the reservations where ITCA conducts the \n12  majority of its voter registration work because many of the places where ITCA hosts voter \n13  registration activities have no electricity or broadband internet access. Consequently, ITCA’s voter \n14  registration drive organizers will face the compounded barrier and expense of generating their own \npower for voter registration drives by running a generator or using battery-operated equipment in \n15 \na manner that does not require internet services. \n16 \n266.  As a result of Defendants’ constitutional and statutory violations enforcing HB \n17 \n2492’s stringent policies, ITCA and its Member Tribes will be overburdened and unable to conduct \n18 \nsuccessful voter registration drives; will be forced to dedicate more resources and time in order to \n19 \nregister the same number of members and voters; will incur costs to purchase and maintain \n20 \nequipment to ensure its voter registration advocacy complies with HB 2492; and fewer Tribal \n21 \n22 \n  51 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 52 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  Members will be able to successfully register to vote and then cast a ballot in all elections for \n2  which they are eligible. \n267.  Citizens of ITCA’s Member Tribes will also be directly harmed by HB 2492. \n3 \n268.  Many members of ITCA’s Member Tribes are eligible voters in the State of \n4 \nArizona. However, HB 2492’s burdensome registration requirements will bar many Tribal Citizens \n5 \nwho are eligible voters from registering to vote and casting a ballot.  \n6 \n269.  Many of ITCA’s Member Tribes have large rural land bases that commonly lack \n7 \nuniform residential addressing systems to identify physical residential addresses. Consequently, it \n8 \nis not uncommon for homes on Reservations belonging to ITCA Member Tribes not to have a \n9 \nnumbered street address. As a result, Tribal citizens may be unable to obtain any documentation \n10 \nlisting their residential address. \n11 \n270.  Tribal membership identification cards issued by ITCA’s Member Tribes also may \n12  not list a member’s residential address, instead listing a P.O. Box or no address at all.  \n13  271.  Living conditions on ITCA Member Tribes’ Reservations also commonly make it \n14  more difficult for citizens to obtain official documentation listing their address. Homes within \nITCA Member Tribes’ Reservations may not have electricity, internet, telephone, or other utilities, \n15 \nmeaning that residents do not have the associated documentation. Moreover, citizens of ITCA’s \n16 \nMember Tribes may also move frequently between homes due to circumstances beyond their \n17 \ncontrol, and therefore not be listed on any official documentation associated with their residence. \n18 \n272.  Citizens of ITCA’s Member Tribes who live on their Reservation are therefore \n19 \ncommonly likely to be unable to obtain documentary proof of their residence, as required by HB \n20 \n2492, either because their residence lacks a numbered street address entirely, or because they are \n21 \nnot officially listed as a resident of the home where they stay. \n22 \n  52 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 53 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  273.  In violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law, HB 2492 discriminates against \n2  otherwise eligible voters who are members of ITCA’s Member Tribes based on whether they are \nable to provide DPOC and DPOR, check the citizenship box, and attest to birthplace by prohibiting \n3 \nvoters who do not comply with these requirements from registering to vote.  \n4 \nSan Carlos Apache Tribe \n5 \n \n274. The San Carlos Apache Tribe (“Tribe”) is a federally recognized Indian Tribe \n6 \norganized pursuant to Section 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984), \n7 \nwith approximately 17,000 enrolled members. 86 Fed. Reg. 7554. The Tribe comes from the Ndee \n8 \nor Western Apache Nation. The Ndee have lived and traveled throughout present-day Arizona and \n9 \nNew Mexico for more than a thousand years. In 1871, several bands of Ndee were relocated to the \n10 \nSan Carlos Apache Reservation (“Reservation”) in southeastern Arizona. These bands, along with \n11 \nother Ndee who were subsequently relocated to the Reservation, make up the Tribe.  \n12  275. The Reservation in eastern Arizona is currently the tenth largest Indian reservation \n13  in the United States, covering an area of approximately 2,855 square miles, or 1.8 million acres.  \n14  276. The  Reservation  was  established  (and  subsequently  diminished)  by  several \nExecutive Orders and Acts of Congress, including Executive Orders of November 9, 1871 and \n15 \nDecember 14, 1872 (establishing the White Mountain and San Carlos Reservations). See Executive \n16 \nOrders of August 5, 1873; July 21, 1874; April 27, 1876; October 30, 1876; January 26, 1877; and \n17 \nMarch 31, 1877 (diminishing the White Mountain and San Carlos Reservations); and the Act of \n18 \nJune 7, 1897, 30 Stat. 64 (creating the Fort Apache Reservation and establishing the Fort Apache \n19 \nAgency “to cover and have jurisdiction” over the Reservation). \n20 \n277. The Reservation spans across Gila, Graham, and Pinal Counties and is home to \n21 \napproximately 11,000 members, while the remainder of the Tribe’s members live off-Reservation.  \n22 \n  53 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 54 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  278. Many members of the Tribe are eligible voters in the State of Arizona. However, \n2  only about a quarter of the Tribe’s members are registered to vote. \n279. The Tribe does not have a uniform street numbering system to identify physical \n3 \nresidential addresses. Most streets on the Reservation do not have listed names, and not all \n4 \nresidences on the Reservation have numbered street addresses. Consequently, many of the Tribe’s \n5 \nmembers lack documents listing their residential address.  \n6 \n280. Likewise, the Tribe’s membership identification cards generally do not include a \n7 \nresidential address; instead, they list the citizen’s mailing address.  \n8 \n281. Physical  residential  mail  service similarly does not  exist on the Reservation. \n9 \nInstead, most enrolled members who live on the Reservation receive mail through a Post Office \n10 \nBox on or near the Reservation. \n11 \n282. Although a membership identification card issued by the Tribe would be sufficient \n12  proof of identification for an enrolled member to cast a ballot under Arizona law and the Gonzalez \n13  consent decree, it would apparently not meet the DPOR Requirement in HB 2492 because the \n14  identification card does not include the citizen’s physical residential address. \n283. The Tribe has many members who live in poverty. More than a third (36.8 percent) \n15 \nof households on the San Carlos Apache Reservation have incomes below the federal poverty line. \n16 \nAs a result, some members of the Tribe move frequently from home to home and may live \n17 \ntemporarily between homes belonging to relatives and other members of the Tribe. \n18 \n284.  Members of the Tribe who live on the Reservation are likely to be unable to obtain \n19 \ndocumentary proof of their residence, as required by HB 2492, either because their residence lacks \n20 \na numbered street address entirely, or because they are not officially listed as a resident of the \n21 \nhome where they stay. \n22 \n  54 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 55 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  285. In violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law, HB 2492 discriminates against \n2  otherwise eligible voters who are members of the Tribe based on whether they are able to provide \nDPOC and DPOR, check the citizenship box, and attest to birthplace by prohibiting voters who do \n3 \nnot comply with these requirements from registering to vote.  \n4 \n286. The Tribe has engaged and continues to engage in voter education, registration, and \n5 \nengagement activities for its members to facilitate participation in nontribal elections that will be \n6 \nthwarted by HB 2492. For example, this year, the Office of the General Manager at the San Carlos \n7 \nApache Tribe is working in collaboration with the Gila County Recorder’s Office to host voter \n8 \nregistration  events  on  the  Reservation  to  encourage  registration  by  members  of  the  Tribe. \n9 \nDefendants’ enforcement of HB 2942 will thwart the Tribe’s voter registration activities by \n10 \npreventing its members who cannot provide DPOR from registering to vote at the Tribe’s voter \n11 \nregistration events, and by requiring the Tribe to ramp up education efforts to teach voters what is \n12  required for registration and voting.  \n13  287. Moreover, it will likely require the Tribe to divert limited resources from other \n14  programs into its voter registration and education activities in order to assist members of the Tribe \nwho have no numbered street address with compliance with the DPOR Requirement. \n15 \n288. HB 2492’s disparate treatment of otherwise eligible voters based on whether they \n16 \nare able to provide DPOC, provide DPOR, attest to birthplace, and add a citizenship checkmark \n17 \nmeans that voter registration drive organizers must inform voters of the many new changes in the \n18 \nlaw and the threats of criminal investigation and prosecution.  \n19 \n289. The Tribe expects that many of its members that it seeks to register to vote will be \n20 \nintimidated and discouraged from registering to vote, even though they are eligible, because of the \n21 \nunconstitutional burdens imposed on the exercise of their franchise by HB 2492’s requirements.  \n22 \n  55 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 56 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  290. Because the Tribe conducts voter registration drives on reservations with the goal \n2  of completing voter registrations on-site, the Tribe’s members who do not have Arizona drivers’ \nlicenses and/or do not have DPOC or DPOR with them cannot fully participate.  \n3 \n291. Even if applicants happen to have DPOC or DPOR at an on-Reservation voter \n4 \nregistration drive, the San Carlos Apache Tribe must now incur costs and additional burdens to \n5 \npurchase and maintain mobile scanning and printing equipment to facilitate voter registration \n6 \napplications that comply with HB 2492.  \n7 \n292. As a result of Defendants’ constitutional and statutory violations enforcing HB \n8 \n2492’s stringent policies, the San Carlos Apache Tribe will be overly burdened and unable to \n9 \nconduct successful voter registration drives; will be forced to dedicate more resources and time in \n10 \norder to register the same number of members and voters; will incur costs to purchase and maintain \n11 \nequipment to ensure its voter registration advocacy complies with HB 2492; and fewer Tribal \n12  members will be able to successfully register to vote and then cast a ballot in all elections for which \n13  they are eligible. \n14    Arizona Coalition for Change \n \n293.  Arizona Coalition for Change (“AZC4C”) is a non-profit organization with a \n15 \nmission to empower everyday people to transform their communities by building civic power, just \n16 \nand equitable schools, and safer neighborhoods. AZC4C’s civic engagement team’s primary \n17 \nmission is to register people to vote. AZC4C conducts get-out-the-vote campaigns, voter education \n18 \nprograms, and trainings that teach Arizonans how to advocate for issues at the local, state, and \n19 \nfederal  levels.  AZC4C  also  conducts  in-person  voter  registration  events.  In  2020,  AZC4C \n20 \nregistered 10,141 voters. \n21 \n22 \n  56 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 57 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  294.  HB 2492 will negatively affect the voters that AZC4C helps to register to vote, \n2  many of whom are people of color, and are therefore significantly more likely to lack required \ndocumentation under HB 2492. \n3 \n295.  As a result of HB 2492, AZC4C must divert money, personnel, time, and resources \n4 \naway from other programming in order to dedicate more resources toward efforts to ensure that \n5 \nvoters, particularly those of color and those who are low income, can navigate the restrictions that \n6 \nHB 2492 imposes on their right to vote. AZC4C expects to divert resources in order to assist low-\n7 \nincome Arizonans, racial and ethnic minority groups, people with disabilities, seniors, and others \n8 \nwho disproportionately lack access to voter ID. HB 2492 will make AZC4C’s voter registration \n9 \ncampaigns more time consuming and discourage otherwise eligible voters from participating in \n10 \nthe political process. These diversions will continue to occur until the 2022 election and beyond \n11 \nfor as long as these requirements are in effect. \n12  296.  AZC4C expects to spend more time assisting voters in complying with the new \n13  requirements. People of color already face obstacles to voting, including language differences and \n14  delays in receiving accurate information. AZC4C will be forced to dedicate more time and \nresources to inform eligible voters of the new requirements imposed by HB 2492. \n15 \n297.  HB 2492’s disparate treatment of otherwise eligible voters based on whether they \n16 \nlist their birthplace, check the citizenship box, and are able to provide DPOC and DPOR means \n17 \nthat voter registration drive organizers must inform voters of the many new changes in the law and \n18 \nthe threats of criminal investigation and prosecution. \n19 \n298.  When one of the Arizona voters AZC4C assists lacks DPOC or DPOR, they will \n20 \nbe denied the right to register and the right to vote under HB 2492’s eligibility requirements. \n21 \n22 \n  57 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 58 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  299.  AZC4C expects that many of its members and the community members that it seeks \n2  to register to vote will be intimidated and discouraged from registering to vote, even though they \nare eligible, because of the unconstitutional limits imposed on the exercise of their franchise by \n3 \nHB 2492’s requirements. \n4 \n300.  Because AZC4C conducts site-based voter registration drives with the goal of \n5 \ncompleting voter registrations on-site, potential AZC4C members and voters who do not have \n6 \nArizona drivers’ licenses and/or do not have DPOC or DPOR with them cannot fully participate.  \n7 \n301.  Even if applicants happen to have DPOC or DPOR at a AZC4C voter registration \n8 \ndrive, AZC4C must now incur costs and additional burdens to purchase and maintain mobile \n9 \nscanning and printing equipment to facilitate voter registration applications that comply with HB \n10 \n2492. \n11 \n302.  As a result of  Defendant’s enforcement of the unconstitutional  and unlawful \n12  provisions of HB 2492, AZC4C will be overburdened and unable to conduct successful voter \n13  registration drives; AZC4C will be forced to dedicate more resources and time in order to register \n14  the same number of voters; AZC4C will incur costs to purchase and maintain equipment to ensure \nits voter registration advocacy complies with HB 2492; and fewer voters AZC4C reaches will be \n15 \nable to successfully register to vote and then cast a ballot in all elections for which they are eligible. \n16 \nDefendant and Intervenor Defendants \n17 \n303. Defendant Katie Hobbs is the Arizona Secretary of State, a statewide elected public \n18 \nofficer, and is named in her official capacity.  \n19 \n304. The Secretary of State serves as the Chief Election Officer for Arizona. A.R.S. \n20 \n§ 16-142. The Secretary of State is the public officer responsible for supervising voter registration \n21 \nthroughout the state and providing binding regulations and guidelines for voter registration.

Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference all allegations above as though fully \n19  set forth in this paragraph. \n20  309. “There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in \nelecting our political leaders.” McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185, 191 (2014). The Supreme Court \n21 \nhas recognized that “voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional \n22 \n  59 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 60 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  structure” and the right to an effective vote is protected by the First Amendment and the Equal \n2  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433-44 \n(1992). Indeed, the right to vote is the “fundamental political right . . . preservative of all rights.” \n3 \nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562 (1964) (quoting Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 \n4 \n(1886)); see also American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 795 (1974) (“permitting \n5 \nabsentee voting by some classes of voters and denying the privilege to other classes of otherwise \n6 \nqualified voters in similar circumstances, without affording a comparable alternative means to \n7 \nvote, is an arbitrary discrimination violative of the Equal Protection Clause”). \n8 \n310. Further, voting and participation in the electoral process is a form of speech and \n9 \nexpression. It is the ultimate form of political speech and association and is entitled to First \n10 \nAmendment protection. See Arizona Libertarian Party v. Reagan, 798 F.3d 723, 728-29 (9th Cir. \n11 \n2015) (“Restrictions on voting can burden equal protection rights as well as interwoven strands of \n12  liberty protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments—namely, the right of individuals to \n13  associate for the advancement of political beliefs, and the right of qualified voters, regardless of \n14  their political persuasion, to cast their votes effectively.”) (internal citations and quotations \nomitted).  \n15 \n311. When analyzing the constitutionality of a restriction on voting, the Court “must \n16 \nweigh ‘the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and \n17 \nFourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate’ against ‘the precise interests put \n18 \nforward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,’ taking into consideration \n19 \n‘the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.’” Burdick, \n20 \n504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983)). \n21 \n22 \n  60 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 61 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  312. HB 2492’s and HB 2243’s requirements, together and individually, impose severe \n2  and undue burdens on eligible Arizonans’ right to vote in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  \n3 \n313. HB 2492 conditions the right to register and to vote on what type of registration \n4 \nform—the State Form or the Federal Form—an eligible voter happens to use.  \n5 \n314. HB 2492 conditions the right to register on a voter’s willingness to disclose her \n6 \nplace of birth, an immaterial requirement that will intimidate naturalized citizen voters from \n7 \nregistering to vote.  \n8 \n315. HB  2492  conditions  the  right  to  register  on  whether  an  applicant  checks  a \n9 \ncitizenship box even where the applicant has provided documentary proof of citizenship, an \n10 \nimmaterial requirement that will lead to erroneous rejections of registration applications from U.S. \n11 \ncitizens. \n12  316. HB 2492 further conditions voters’ eligibility to exercise their right to register and \n13  their right to vote on whether the voter can access, copy, and submit documentary proof of \n14  residence and of citizenship during the registration and/or voting stages.  \n317. HB 2492 prohibits a class of eligible, registered voters on the Federal-Only Voter \n15 \nList from voting using any method other than in-person voting, and bars that class of voters from \n16 \nvoting in presidential elections altogether.  \n17 \n318. HB 2492 also subjects voters to rejection of their voter registration applications \n18 \naltogether based on faulty and outdated data purporting to show U.S. citizenship status.  \n19 \n319. HB 2492 further subjects voters to harassing and intimidating investigation and \n20 \nprosecution based on incorrect and outdated data purporting to show U.S. citizenship status, \n21 \ndisincentivizing eligible Arizonans from registering to vote. \n22 \n  61 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 62 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  320. HB  2243  similarly  subjects  eligible  registered  voters  to  removal  from  the \n2  registration rolls based on incorrect and outdated data purporting to show residence and/or U.S. \ncitizenship status.  \n3 \n321. HB 2243 further subjects voters to harassing and intimidating investigation and \n4 \nprosecution based on faulty and outdated data purporting to show U.S. citizenship status. \n5 \n322. HB 2492’s and HB 2243’s restrictions, together and individually, are severe. At \n6 \nnumerous stages, these restrictions result in the complete denial of eligible voters’ right to register \n7 \nand to vote. See Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1108 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Ayers-Schaffner v. \n8 \nDiStefano, 37 F.3d 726 (1st Cir. 1994)) (recognizing that a state policy in which “otherwise eligible \n9 \nvoters were not allowed to vote in a determinative election” constitutes a “severe burden on the \n10 \nexcluded voters’ right to vote”). \n11 \n323. Further,  HB  2492’s  and  HB  2243’s  restrictive  and  undue  requirements  on \n12  registering and voting disproportionately impose more significant burdens on certain categories of \n13  voters––including naturalized U.S. citizens, Tribal Citizens, college and university students, low-\n14  income voters, elderly voters, racial and ethnic minorities, language minority voters, voters who \nfrequently move, and voters who have changed their legal name, such as married women.  \n15 \n324.  The challenged HB 2492 and HB 2243 provisions, together and individually, are \n16 \nsubject to strict or heightened scrutiny because they impose severe and disparate burdens on the \n17 \nright to vote, in some instances requiring complete denial of the right to vote for eligible and \n18 \nregistered Arizona voters.  \n19 \n325. The challenged HB 2492 and HB 2243 provisions, together and individually, do \n20 \nnot advance any legitimate regulatory interest. They serve little purpose other than to prevent \n21 \n22 \n  62 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 63 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  qualified Arizona citizens from voting in eligible elections and to deter civic organizations from \n2  conducting voter registration drives.  \n326. The  State’s  purported  goal  of  enhancing  election  security  and  increasing  the \n3 \npublic’s confidence in elections are at best pretextual, and the challenged restrictions are more \n4 \nlikely to undermine than reinforce electoral security and public confidence in Arizona’s elections. \n5 \n327. Regardless, furthering those interests does not necessitate burdening Plaintiffs’ \n6 \nright to vote in this severe and disparate manner.  \n7 \n328. HB 2492’s and HB 2243’s requirements cannot withstand even rational basis \n8 \nreview, much less the strict or heightened scrutiny applied to severe and undue burdens on the \n9 \nright to vote.  \n10 \nCount 2: National Origin Discrimination, Fourteenth Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n11 \n \n329. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference all allegations above as though fully \n12 \nset forth in this paragraph. \n13 \n330. HB 2492 and HB 2243, together and individually, discriminate between Arizona \n14 \ncitizens based on their national origin by imposing disparate requirements and policies affecting \n15 \nnaturalized U.S. citizens, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Hernandez v. Texas, 347 \n16 \nU.S. 475, 482 (1954). Such classifications based on national origin are inherently suspect and \n17 \nsubject to strict scrutiny. Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 371-72 (1971). \n18  331. HB 2492 classifies and subjects naturalized U.S. citizens to disfavored treatment \n19  by imposing more burdensome registration and voting requirements, requiring attestation of their \n20  place of birth to register, and subjecting them to wrongful and harassing criminal investigations \nand prosecutions.  \n21 \n22 \n  63 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 64 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  332. HB 2243 likewise classifies and subjects naturalized U.S. citizens to disparate \n2  treatment by imposing more burdensome requirements to remain on the registration rolls, and \nsubjecting them to wrongful and harassing criminal investigations and prosecutions. \n3 \n333. HB 2492’s and HB 2243’s discriminatory classifications, together and individually, \n4 \nfail strict scrutiny or any lesser level of review.  \n5 \n334. The challenged HB 2492 and HB 2243 provisions are not narrowly tailored to serve \n6 \nany compelling state interest. HB 2492’s and HB 2243’s provisions do not advance any legitimate \n7 \nregulatory interest and serve little purpose other than to subject naturalized U.S. citizen voters to \n8 \ndisfavored treatment and prevent naturalized Arizona citizens from voting. \n9 \n335. The State’s purported goal to enhance electoral security and increase the public’s \n10 \nconfidence  in  Arizona’s  elections  is  at  best  pretextual,  and  HB  2492’s  and  HB  2243’s \n11 \ndiscriminatory restrictions are more likely to undermine than reinforce electoral security and \n12  public confidence in Arizona’s elections. \n13  Count 3: Unlawful Discrimination, Fourteenth Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n14   \n336. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference all allegations above as though fully \n15 \nset forth in this paragraph. \n16 \n337. HB  2492  intentionally  and  arbitrarily  discriminates  against  eligible  voter \n17 \nregistration applicants based on whether they apply using a State Form or a Federal Form. Based \n18  on this arbitrary difference, in many cases eligible citizens seeking to register using the Federal \n19  Form will be registered while similarly situated eligible citizens seeking to register using the State \n20  Form will not be rejected.  \n338. HB 2492 intentionally and arbitrarily discriminates against eligible, registered \n21 \nvoters on Arizona’s Federal-Only Voter List. Under HB 2492, eligible and registered voters placed \n22 \n  64 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 65 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  on the Federal-Only Voter List are prohibited from using Arizona’s early voting opportunities and \n2  from voting in presidential elections; they are constrained to exercise their right to vote only in-\nperson on election day and only to cast a ballot for at most two congressional offices. Similarly \n3 \nsituated eligible voters for federal elections are able to access Arizona’s early voting opportunities \n4 \nand to vote for all available federal offices.  \n5 \n339. HB 2492’s discriminatory and arbitrary classifications fail strict scrutiny, which \n6 \napplies to arbitrary treatment of voters in accessing the fundamental right to vote. HB 2492’s \n7 \ndiscriminatory and arbitrary classifications also fail any lesser level of scrutiny.  \n8 \n340. The  challenged  HB  2492  provisions  are  not  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  any \n9 \ncompelling state interest. Indeed, HB 2492’s provisions do not actually advance any legitimate \n10 \nregulatory interest and serve little purpose other than to subject eligible voters to disfavored \n11 \ntreatment based on which voter registration form they use and to prevent eligible Arizona citizens \n12  from voting.  \n13  341. The State’s purported goal to enhance electoral security and thereby increase the \n14  public’s confidence in elections is at best pretextual, and HB 2492’s discriminatory restrictions are \nmore likely to undermine than reinforce electoral security and public confidence in Arizona’s \n15 \nelections. \n16 \nCount 4: Immaterial Omission on Voter Registration Form \n17 \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983; 52 U.S.C. § 10101) \n \n18  342. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference all allegations above as though fully \n19  set forth in this paragraph. \n20  343. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits states and persons acting under color of state \nlaw from denying the right to vote to any individual “because of an error or omission on any record \n21 \nor paper relating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or \n22 \n  65 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 66 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  omission is not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under State law to vote \n2  in such election.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B). \n344. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides federal statutory rights enforceable under 42 \n3 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \n4 \n345. HB 2492 requires state and local officials to reject voter registration applications \n5 \nand deny the right to vote to any individual who omits their place of birth from their state voter \n6 \nregistration form.  \n7 \n346. An individual’s place of birth has no bearing on any qualification for voting under \n8 \nArizona state law. \n9 \n347. HB 2492’s Birthplace Requirement violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n10 \n348. HB 2492 requires state and local officials to reject voter registration applications \n11 \nand deny the right to vote to any individual who omits a checkmark in a box concerning U.S. \n12  citizenship status on their state or federal voter registration form.  \n13  349. An individual’s ability to check a box concerning U.S. citizenship, in addition to \n14  attesting to their U.S. citizenship under penalty of perjury or providing DPOC under Arizona law, \nhas no bearing on any qualification for voting under Arizona state law. \n15 \n350. HB 2492’s Checkmark Requirement violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n16 \nCount 5: Preemption Under the NVRA \n17 \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983; 52 U.S.C. §§ 20501, et seq.) \n \n18  351. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference all allegations above as though fully \n19  set forth in this paragraph. \n20  352. The NVRA requires states to “accept and use” the Federal Form to register eligible \ncitizens for federal elections. 52 U.S.C. §§ 20503, 20505(a). In this way, the NVRA “acts as both \n21 \na ceiling and a floor” for registering to vote in federal elections, preempting Arizona’s attempt to \n22 \n  66 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 67 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  require registrants to provide information not required by the federal form to register to vote in \n2  federal elections. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. at 18. \n353. The NVRA also requires certain mandated public assistance agencies to provide \n3 \nvoter registration services using the Federal Form or “its equivalent.” 52 U.S.C. § 20506. \n4 \n354. The  NVRA  requires  each  State’s  motor  vehicle  authority  to  provide  voter \n5 \nregistration  services  and  “require  only  the  minimum  amount  of  information  necessary  to-- \n6 \n(i) prevent  duplicate voter registrations; and (ii) enable State election officials  to  assess the \n7 \neligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election \n8 \nprocess.” 52 U.S.C. § 20504.  \n9 \n355. The NVRA requires that each State “ensure that any eligible applicant is registered \n10 \nto vote” if they register by mail, at the Motor Vehicle Division, at an NVRA-mandated agency, or \n11 \nby any other means if the registration is received “not later than the lesser of 30 days, or the period \n12  provided by State law, before the date of the election[.]” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1).  \n13  356. The NVRA mandates that any registration or list maintenance program be uniform \n14  and nondiscriminatory. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b)(1). \n357. The NVRA provides federal statutory rights enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n15 \n358. HB 2492 prohibits county election officials from registering otherwise eligible \n16 \nvoters to vote in federal elections—including by the Federal Form, through the Motor Vehicle \n17 \nDivision, or at NVRA-mandated voter registration agencies—unless they provide documentary \n18 \nproof of residence, in violation of the NVRA.  \n19 \n359. HB 2492 prohibits county election officials from registering otherwise eligible \n20 \nvoters to vote in federal elections through the Motor Vehicle Division, or at NVRA-mandated \n21 \n22 \n  67 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 68 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  voter registration agencies unless they provide documentary proof of citizenship, in violation of \n2  the NVRA.  \n360. HB 2492 treats voters who register via the Federal Form as less than fully registered \n3 \nvoters by prohibiting such voters from using all available forms of voting, including mail-in voting \n4 \nin violation of the NVRA.  \n5 \n361. HB 2492 and HB 2243 imposes discriminatory registration and list maintenance \n6 \nprocedures by requiring county election officials to reject or initiate the cancellation of valid voter \n7 \nregistrations based on inaccurate and outdated data and information sources purporting to contain \n8 \nU.S. citizenship or residence information, in violation of the NVRA. \n9 \n362. Plaintiffs provided the Secretary with written notice of these violations of the \n10 \nNVRA on April 6, 2022. 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(1). A second written notice of these violations was \n11 \nsent at the time this Complaint was filed. Because the Secretary failed to remedy the violation within \n12  90 days after receipt of Plaintiffs’ notice, Plaintiffs bring this action. See id. § 20510(b)(2). \n13  Count 6: Discriminatory Effects in Violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983; 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301) \n14   \n363. Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference all allegations above as though fully \n15 \nset forth in this paragraph. \n16 \n364. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (“Section 2”) prohibits states and political \n17 \nsubdivisions from using any “voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or \n18  procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States \n19  to vote on account of race or color” or because of an individual’s membership in a language \n20  minority community. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). \n365. A violation of Section 2 is established when “based on the totality of circumstances, \n21 \nit is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political \n22 \n  68 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 69 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class of citizens \n2  protected in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to \nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Id. § 10301(b). \n3 \n366. Section 2 permits suits by private individuals to enforce their rights and by entities, \n4 \nincluding Tribal Nations, suing on behalf of those individuals. Section 2 may also be privately \n5 \nenforced through 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n6 \n367. By  requiring  individuals  to  produce  DPOR  in  order  to  register  to  vote, \n7 \nimplementing additional DPOC procedures, requiring voter registration applicants to list their place \n8 \nof birth on their voter registration form, imposing discriminatory rejection and removal procedures \n9 \nbased  on  faulty  and  discriminatory  data,  and  threatening  naturalized  citizens  with  criminal \n10 \ninvestigation, HB 2492 and HB 2243 will deny and abridge the voting rights of Native Americans, \n11 \nLatinos, voters of color, and members of language minority communities. \n12  368. The laws will affect a substantial portion of these populations. Likewise, the impact \n13  on these populations is unique because the law will not equally affect Arizona residents writ large. \n14  369. Since these provisions are barriers to registration, impacted individuals will be \nwholly barred from voting, meaning that the State’s entire system of voting becomes inaccessible. \n15 \n370. HB 2492 and HB 2243 impose novel requirements and restrictions that go well \n16 \nbeyond the “usual burdens of voting.” Instead, they impose novel burdens using devices that were \n17 \nnot in common use at the time of the passage of the Voting Rights Act and its amendments, \n18 \nespecially in Arizona. \n19 \n371. The State cannot and has not offered a rational, much less compelling, justification \n20 \nfor adopting HB 2492 and HB 2243’s burdensome procedures.  \n21 \n22 \n  69 \n23 \n \n24 \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 67   Filed 07/18/22   Page 70 of 72\n \n \n   \n \n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n2    WHERFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \n   \n(1)   Enter  judgment  in  favor  of  Plaintiffs  and  against  Defendant  and  Intervenor-\n3 \nDefendants on the claims for relief as alleged in this Complaint; \n4 \n(2)  Enter a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 declaring \n5 \nthat the challenged HB 2492 and HB 2243 provisions, facially and as-applied, \n6 \nviolate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the First \n7 \nAmendment;  \n8 \n(3)   Enter a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 declaring \n9 \nthat the challenged HB 2492 provisions violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 52 \n10 \nU.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B); \n11 \n(4)   Enter a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 declaring \n12  that the challenged HB 2492 and HB 2243 provisions are preempted by the National \n13  Voter Registration Act, 52 U.S.C. § 20501, et seq. \n14  (5)  Enter declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 declaring that \nthe challenged HB 2492 and HB 2243 provisions violate Section 2 of the Voting \n15 \nRights Act of 1965. \n16 \n(4)  Grant Plaintiffs preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief by: \n17 \n  a.

This suit challenges provisions recently enacted as part of Arizona House Bill \n6 \n7  2492 (“HB 2492”) and Arizona House Bill 2243 (“HB 2243”) that overhaul Arizona’s \n8 \nalready  highly  restrictive  and  needlessly  complex  voter  registration  system.  Once \n9 \nimplemented  in  2023,  the  statutes’  new  citizenship  investigation  procedures  for  both \n10 \nregistration applicants and existing registered voters, removal mechanisms, and proof of \n11 \nresidence requirement will operate in tandem to target Arizona’s naturalized citizen voters, \n12 \n13  who are predominantly racial and ethnic minority voters,1 and in particular, the Latinx \n14 \ncommunities that Plaintiffs serve. These provisions—many of which are found nowhere else \n15 \nin the country—violate the U.S. Constitution’s prohibitions on discriminatory and arbitrary \n16 \ntreatment of voters and its guarantees of equal protection and due process, the National Voter \n17 \n18  Registration Act (“NVRA”), and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n19 \n2.  When HB 2492 and HB 2243 take effect next year,2 these new mandates will \n20 \nimmediately result in the inaccurate, arbitrary, discriminatory, and ultimately unlawful \n21 \n22                                                \n1 United States Census Bureau, Table S0501, “Selected Characteristics of the Native and \n23 \nForeign-Born  Populations,”  available  at \n24  https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S0501%3A%20SELECTED%20CHARACTERIST\nICS%20OF%20THE%20NATIVE%20AND%20FOREIGN-\n25 \nBORN%20POPULATIONS&g=0400000US04&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S0501.  \n26  2 A separate bill, Senate Bill 1638 (“SB 1638”), delays the effective date of HB 2492 until \nJanuary 1, 2023. See SB 1638, Section 4(A).  On information and belief, the Arizona \n27 \nSecretary of State takes the position that HB 2243’s implementation is also effectively \n28  delayed until January 1, 2023 because HB 2243 alters a statutory provision newly created \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 4 of 68\ntreatment of naturalized voters throughout Arizona—all of whom are United States citizens \n1 \n2  who may be erroneously flagged as non-citizens based on old and inaccurate data or the \n3 \npersonal beliefs  of  local  officials,  subjected  to unwarranted  extra  scrutiny,  unlawfully \n4 \nremoved from the rolls, and even prosecuted. HB 2492 and HB 2243’s pernicious effects \n5 \nwill be felt disproportionately by Arizona’s racial and ethnic minority voters, including \n6 \n7  Latinx  voters.  Consequently,  the  challenged  laws  will  do  severe  harm  to  the  voter \n8 \nregistration operations and civic engagement mission of community organizations like \n9 \nPlaintiffs, which are engaged in securing the trust of Latinx voters and assisting them in \n10 \nregistering to vote. The challenged laws will also directly harm the communities and \n11 \n12  constituencies served by Plaintiffs.  \n13 \n3.  To prevent the harm to the community of voters Plaintiffs Poder Latinx and \n14 \nCPLC serve and the undermining of its voter registration and civic engagement operations, \n15 \nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of HB 2492 and HB 2243’s vague, arbitrary, and \n16 \n17  unconstitutional procedures for investigating the U.S. citizenship of registration applicants \n18 \nwho apply with the NVRA mail-in registration form (the “Federal Registration Form” or \n19 \n“Federal  Form”)  and  currently  registered  voters,  and  acting  on  the  results  of  those \n20 \ninvestigations. The specific challenged provisions within HB 2492 and HB 2243 include the \n21 \n22  following:  \n23 \n \n24 \n \n25 \n                                              \n26 \nby HB 2492. On information and belief, the county recorders are not in a position to \n27  implement the changes made by HB 2492 and HB 2243 without the Arizona Secretary of \nState’s office. \n28 \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 5 of 68\n The Citizenship Investigation Provisions: \n1 \n2  •  Ariz.

The  Citizenship  Investigation  Provisions  and  the  DPOR  requirement  are \n17 \nreferred to herein collectively as “the Challenged Provisions.” \n18 \n5.  HB 2492 and HB 2243 require Defendant Secretary of State Katie Hobbs \n19 \n(“Defendant Hobbs”), Defendant Attorney General Mark Brnovich (“Defendant Brnovich”), \n20 \nDefendant Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, Defendant Pima County Recorder \n21 \n22  Gabriella Cázares-Kelly, Defendant Yuma County Recorder Richard Colwell (collectively, \n23 \n“Defendants”), and the county recorders in Arizona’s other counties to implement the \n24 \nCitizenship Investigation Provisions. These provisions require Arizona election and law \n25 \nenforcement officials, including each of the Defendants, to compare voter registration data \n26 \n27  to all available federal, state, and local databases in search of “information” that registration \n28 \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 6 of 68\napplicants and registered voters lack U.S. citizenship. HB 2492 and 2243 authorize county \n1 \n2  recorders and Defendant Brnovich to use “information” that the applicant or registered voter \n3 \n“is not a United States citizen” to reject registration forms, cancel existing registered voters’ \n4 \nrecords, and subject these erroneously flagged individuals to investigation and prosecution. \n5 \nThese statutes require the rejection or cancellation of a voter’s registration based on any \n6 \n7  citizenship “information” the county recorder obtains and “confirms,” regardless of whether \n8 \nthat  information  is  current,  accurate,  and  validated,  and  even  if  that  information  is \n9 \nsuperseded by the individual’s subsequent naturalization.  \n10 \n6.  Governor Doug Ducey himself identified serious legal problems with this new \n11 \n12  process. When the legislature passed House Bill 2617 (“HB 2617”) earlier this past session, \n13  a bill that contained many of the same provisions later included in HB 2243, he vetoed it.3 \n14 \nGovernor Ducey issued a veto statement that argued the following: \n15 \nIt is equally important that our laws include safeguards to protect the vote of \n16  any Arizonan who is eligible and lawfully registered. . . . \n \n17  H.B. 2617 requires a county recorder to cancel the voter registration of a voter \nif the recorder receives information that provides the basis for determining that \n18  the person is not a qualified elector. The implementation of this provision is \nvague and lacks any guidance for how a county recorder would confirm such \n19  a determination. Our lawfully registered voters deserve to know that their right \nto vote will not be disturbed without sufficient due process. This provision \n20  leaves our election system vulnerable to bad actors who could seek to falsely \nallege a voter is not a qualified elector. \n21   \n. . . . The subjectivity of this provision, as well as a lack of guardrails against \n22  false claims, included in H.B. 2617 leaves voter registration susceptible to \nbeing canceled based on fiction rather than fact.  \n23   \n24 \n25 \n                                              \n26 \n3 A revised version of HB 2617 was added into HB 2243 late in Arizona’s 2022 legislative \n27  session. Governor Ducey signed HB 2243 into law on July 6, 2022. As described infra, some \nprovisions from HB 2617 were amended in HB 2243, but others remained unchanged. \n28 \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 7 of 68\nSee Letter from Governor Ducey to Rusty Bowers, Speaker of the Arizona State House of \n1 \n2  Representatives,  (May  27,  2022),  available \n3 \nat https://www.azleg.gov/govlettr/55leg/2r/hb2617.pdf. Just as the phrase “information that \n4 \nthe person . . . is not a United States citizen” was, in Governor Ducey’s words, “vague” and \n5 \nleft the system “vulnerable to bad actors,” HB 2492’s use of the same disqualification \n6 \n7  standard suffers from the same fatal defects. Similarly, HB 2243’s further amendments to \n8 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165 ultimately perpetuate many of the same legal problems that caused \n9 \nthe Governor to veto this legislation the first time around, including but not limited to the \n10 \nlaw’s vulnerability to third-party false accusations. \n11 \n12  7.  A clear example of this problem is newly created Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H), \n13 \nwhich runs afoul of clear precedents under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which \n14 \nban racial and/or national origin discrimination in voting. This provision authorizes county \n15 \nrecorders to act on mere suspicions and any other subjective “reason to believe [that \n16 \n17  registered voters] are not United States citizens”: \n18  To the extent practicable, each month the county recorder shall compare \npersons who are registered to vote in that county and who the county recorder \n19  has reason to believe are not United States citizens and persons who are \nregistered to vote without satisfactory evidence of citizenship as prescribed by \n20  Section  16-166  with  the  Systematic  Alien  Verification  for  Entitlements \nprogram  maintained  by  the  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration \n21  Services to verify the citizenship status of the persons registered. \n \n22 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 370 § 2 (emphasis \n23 \nadded). This provision is an open invitation for discriminatory, unequal, and arbitrary \n24 \ntreatment of registered voters, particularly naturalized racial and ethnic minority voters. As \n25 \n26  with similarly vague, undefined provisions in HB 2492 (and vetoed HB 2617), any kind of \n27 \n“information”—including a false third-party accusation or “information” county recorders \n28 \n5 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 8 of 68\nlearn by interacting with or observing the registered voter including their perceived race or \n1 \n2  ethnicity—can give a county recorder “reason to believe” that a registered voter is not a \n3 \nUnited States citizen. Receipt of such “information” triggers Defendants’ obligation to \n4 \nsubject those voters to extra investigation and potential removal from the statewide voter \n5 \nregistration database. Under this provision, a county recorder is licensed to act on mere \n6 \n7  suspicion or rumor, or a prejudiced view of the registered voter’s race, ethnicity, national \n8 \norigin, English proficiency, or dress. Far from eliminating the threat of third-party false \n9 \naccusations Governor Ducey identified, HB 2243 merely shifted it to another vague, open-\n10 \nended provision. \n11 \n12  8.  Even prior to the enactment of HB 2492 and HB 2243, Arizona’s documentary \n13 \nproof of citizenship (“DPOC”) requirement, first adopted in 2004 as part of Proposition 200, \n14 \nwas the only such law enforced in the nation. Now the Challenged Provisions will impose \n15 \nadditional  restrictions  on  Arizona’s  already  uniquely  burdensome  and  byzantine  voter \n16 \n17  registration system. No other state in the country is enforcing such draconian measures. The \n18 \nexperience of the other 49 states that are not imposing these unique burdens on citizens \n19 \nattempting to vote demonstrates that the restrictions imposed by HB 2492 and HB 2243 are \n20 \nunnecessary to assess voter registration applicants’ or registered voters’ qualifications. \n21 \n22  9.  The Citizenship Investigation Provisions in HB 2492 and HB 2243 violate the \n23 \nU.S. Constitution and federal law in several ways.  \n24 \n  First, the Challenged Provisions contained in HB 2492 violate Section 8(b) of the \n25 \nNational Voter Registration Act, which requires uniform and non-discriminatory \n26 \nvoter registration processes. Naturalized citizens are treated in a non-uniform \n27 \n28 \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 9 of 68\nmanner under HB 2492, and Arizona voters will face discriminatory treatment \n1 \n2  based on their race, ethnicity, and national origin.4  \n3 \n  Second, HB 2243’s creation of 16-165(H) violates Title I of the 1964 Civil Rights \n4 \nAct, specifically 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A), because it subjects different groups \n5 \nof  eligible  voters  to  different  “standard[s],  practice[s],  or  procedure[s]”  for \n6 \n7  verifying voting eligibility, based on nothing more than a county recorder’s \n8 \nperception that there is “reason to believe [that registered voters] are  not United \n9 \nStates citizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H). \n10 \n  Third, Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H) will result in the discriminatory and arbitrary \n11 \n12  treatment  of  naturalized  voters  and,  by  extension,  Latinx  voters.  This  new \n13 \nprovision  vests  county  recorders  with  the  explicit  authority  to  act  on  mere \n14 \nsuspicions of non-citizenship, and to subject voters to discriminatory and unequal \n15 \ntreatment based on any perception that the county recorder’s staff deems to be \n16 \n17  indicative  of  non-citizenship.  It  violates  the  Fourteenth  and  Fifteenth \n18 \nAmendments’ prohibitions on the discriminatory treatment of voters on the basis \n19 \nof race and/or national origin. \n20 \n  Fourth, the Citizenship Investigation Provisions are bereft of any rules or criteria \n21 \n22  for Defendants to apply in deciding who is and who is not a U.S. citizen. Whereas \n23 \nthe preexisting DPOC requirement contains an objective list of the specific forms \n24 \n25                                                \n4 Plaintiffs have submitted a second NVRA notice letter to Defendant Secretary of State \n26 \nHobbs, identifying NVRA violations in HB 2243, which was enacted at the end of this \n27  legislative session. Based on an effective date of January for HB 2243, these NVRA claims \ncannot be added to this complaint until late October. \n28 \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 10 of 68\nof documentation that prove a registration applicant’s U.S. citizenship, Ariz. Rev. \n1 \n2  Stat. § 16-166(F), HB 2492 and HB 2243 do not articulate what “information” \n3 \nwill prove that a registration applicant or registered voter “is not a United States \n4 \ncitizen.” In particular, HB 2492 and HB 2243 fail to inform Arizona state and \n5 \nlocal officials as to how they should review and evaluate outdated citizenship \n6 \n7  status  information  contained  in  government  databases.  Without  specific \n8 \ninstructions, the statutes invite Defendants to make inconsistent and irreconcilable \n9 \ndeterminations as to applicants’ and voters’ current citizenship status. Different \n10 \ncounty recorders and different staff members within a county recorder’s office \n11 \n12  will necessarily apply varying rules, standards, and methods in comparing voter \n13 \nregistration  applicants  and  registered  voters  to  the  government  and  voter \n14 \nregistration databases that they are required to search pursuant to HB 2492 and \n15 \nHB  2243.  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  §  16-165(H)  especially  gives  county  recorders \n16 \n17  unlimited discretion to subject registered voters they suspect are not U.S. citizens \n18 \nto extra, unwarranted investigation, and to deny them their right to vote. Such \n19 \narbitrary and disparate treatment of voter registration applicants and currently \n20 \nregistered  voters  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \n21 \n22  Amendment. \n23    Fifth, the failure to provide naturalized-citizen registration applicants or existing \n24 \nvoters who are erroneously flagged as non-citizens with an opportunity to contest \n25 \nthese  citizenship  status  determinations  violates  the  Fourteenth  Amendment’s \n26 \nprotections for procedural due process. While registration applicants who do not \n27 \n28 \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 11 of 68\ninclude DPOC with the federal form must be notified when county recorders \n1 \n2  locate “information that the applicant is not a United States citizen,” Ariz. Rev. \n3 \nStat. § 16-121.01(E), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4, HB 2492 \n4 \ndoes not afford these applicants an opportunity to be heard and attest to or even \n5 \nprovide documentary proof of their U.S. citizenship before their voter registration \n6 \n7  application is rejected. Combined with the arbitrariness of these open-ended and \n8 \nvague investigation directives, HB 2492 violates the Due Process Clause. \n9 \n10.  Finally, Plaintiffs also challenge HB 2492’s documentary proof of residence \n10 \n(“DPOR”)  requirement  as  a  violation  of  the  National  Voter  Registration  Act,  which \n11 \n12  preempts contrary state laws under the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Arizona v. Inter \n13 \nTribal Council of Arizona. (ITCA), 570 U.S. 1 (2013). \n14 \n11.  Plaintiffs challenge these provisions of HB 2492 and HB 2243 under the \n15 \nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, as enforced by 42 \n16 \n17  U.S.C. § 1983, the National Voter Registration Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 20505, 20507, and the \n18 \n1964 Civil Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A). Poder Latinx and CPLC respectfully \n19 \nseek a declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. \n20 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21   \n12.  This Court has federal subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n22 \n23  over this suit because it arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n24 \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n25 \n2201 and 2202. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 12 of 68\n14.  Plaintiffs’ claims under the NVRA are proper because Arizona is covered by \n1 \n2  the NVRA. 52 U.S.C. § 20502(4). \n3 \n15.  This Court has jurisdiction to award attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 \n4 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § 1920. \n5 \n16.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendant  Hobbs,  Defendant \n6 \n7  Brnovich, Defendant Richer, Defendant Cázares-Kelly, and Defendant Colwell, who are \n8 \nsued in their official capacities. Defendants Hobbs and Brnovich are state officials, and \n9 \nDefendant Richer is a county official, each of whom reside in Arizona and work in Phoenix, \n10 \nArizona. Defendants Cázares-Kelly and Colwell are county officials, each of whom reside \n11 \n12  in Arizona. \n13 \n17.  Venue is appropriate in the District of Arizona because a substantial part of \n14 \nthe events giving rise to these claims occurred and continues to occur in this district, making \n15 \nvenue also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). \n16 \n17  PARTIES \n18 \n18.

Arizona’s Documentary Proof of Citizenship Requirement  \n3 \n27.  Since 2005, Arizona election law has contained a documentary proof of \n4 \ncitizenship (“DPOC”) requirement for voter registration applicants. When a person registers \n5 \nto vote, they must provide one of the following forms of “evidence of citizenship” from the \n6 \n7  statutory list: \n8 \n1. The number of the applicant’s driver license or nonoperating identification \nlicense issued after October 1, 1996 by the department of transportation or the \n9 \nequivalent governmental agency of another state within the United States if \n10  the  agency  indicates  on  the  applicant’s  driver  license  or  nonoperating \nidentification license that the person has provided satisfactory proof of United \n11 \nStates citizenship. \n12   \n2.  A  legible  photocopy  of  the  applicant’s  birth  certificate  that  verifies \n13 \ncitizenship to the satisfaction of the county recorder. \n \n14 \n3. A legible photocopy of pertinent pages of the applicant’s United States \n15  passport identifying the applicant and the applicant’s passport number or \npresentation to the county recorder of the applicant’s United States passport. \n16 \n \n17  4. A presentation to the county recorder of the applicant’s United States \nnaturalization documents or the number of the certificate of naturalization. If \n18 \nonly the number of the certificate of naturalization is provided, the applicant \nshall not be included in the registration rolls until the number of the certificate \n19 \nof  naturalization  is  verified  with  the  United  States  immigration  and \n20  naturalization service by the county recorder. \n \n21 \n5. Other documents or methods of proof that are established pursuant to the \n22  immigration reform and control act of 1986. \n \n23  6. The applicant’s bureau of Indian affairs card number, tribal treaty card \nnumber or tribal enrollment number. \n24 \n \n25  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-166(F). \n26 \n28.  The DPOC requirement permits applicants to provide certain identification \n27 \nnumbers in lieu of the presentation of a physical document, subject to the requirement that \n28 \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 17 of 68\nthese must be verified by the county recorders’ offices prior to adding voters to the rolls. For \n1 \n2  instance, the number on an Arizona driver’s license or state identification card issued after \n3 \nOctober 1, 1996 fully satisfies the DPOC requirement if the county recorder’s office verifies \n4 \nthat the license or card holder has not been issued an “F-type” license. 2019 Arizona Election \n5 \nProcedures  Manual  (“2019  EPM”)  at  3.6  The  Arizona  Department  of  Transportation \n6 \n7  (“AZDOT”) Motor Vehicles Division (“MVD”) issues F-type licenses to individuals who \n8 \nare  legally  present  in  the United States  but  who  are  not  U.S. citizens  at  the  time  of \n9 \napplication. Id. at 3-4.7 When such an individual later naturalizes as a U.S. citizen and still \n10 \npossesses an F-type license, old AZDOT data will still reflect that the cardholder is a non-\n11 \n12  citizen, and another form of “evidence of citizenship” must be supplied before the applicant \n13 \nwill be registered to vote a full ballot. Id. at 3 (“[T]he verification must not return a result \n14 \nthat indicates non-citizenship (i.e., an ‘F-type’ license).” It takes money—including funds \n15 \nto obtain underlying documentation—and time to trade in an F-type license and obtain a \n16 \n17  license (and along with it, a database record) that reflects the voter registration applicant’s \n18 \nU.S. citizenship.  \n19 \n29.  Nine years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Arizona v. Inter Tribal \n20 \nCouncil of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1 (2013) (“ITCA”), a challenge to the application of \n21 \n22 \n23                                                \n6  2019  Arizona  Election  Procedures  Manual,  available  at \n24 \nhttps://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/2019_ELECTIONS_PROCEDURES_MANUAL_APP\nROVED.pdf.   \n25 \n7  See  also  Foreign  Applicants, Arizona  Department  of  Transportation,  available \n26 \nat https://azdot.gov/motor-vehicles/driver-services/driver-license-information/foreign-\n27  applicants (last visited Sept. 5 7, 2022) (detailing how foreign applicants can obtain a \ndriver’s license in Arizona). \n28 \n15 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 18 of 68\nArizona’s proof of citizenship requirement to the federal registration form. In an opinion \n1 \n2  written by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court concluded that the NVRA prohibits states from \n3 \napplying different or additional requirements, such as Arizona’s DPOC requirement, to the \n4 \nfederal registration form. The Court expressly held “that [52 U.S.C. § 20505] precludes \n5 \nArizona from requiring a Federal Form applicant to submit information beyond that required \n6 \n7  by the form itself.” ITCA, 570 U.S. at 20. Arizona’s DPOC requirement is not part of the \n8 \nArizona-specific instructions for the federal registration form.  \n9 \n30.  Since  the  ITCA  decision,  Arizona  has  administered  the  nation’s  only \n10 \ncontinuing dual-track voter registration and voting process. Under this system, registered \n11 \n12  Arizona voters who have provided DPOC may vote in all elections, including federal, state, \n13 \nand local elections. They are known as “full-ballot” voters. Registered Arizona voters who \n14 \nhave not provided DPOC—and for whom none has been located by county recorders, see \n15 \ninfra—are only permitted to vote in federal elections. They are known as “federal-only” \n16 \n17  voters.8 HB 2492 arbitrarily prohibits such “federal-only” voters from voting in presidential \n18 \nelections; under the new law, once effective, they may therefore only vote in congressional \n19 \nelections. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-127(A)(1), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 5. \n20 \n31.  Prior to HB 2492’s enactment, Arizona law required county recorders to \n21 \n22  search the MVD database for DPOC whenever any registration applicant submitted any \n23 \nregistration form without DPOC. 2019 EPM at 6. This requirement was imposed to force \n24 \n25                                                \n8  Arizona  Secretary  of  State,  Proof  of  Citizenship  Requirements, \n26 \nhttps://azsos.gov/elections/voting-election/proof-citizenship-requirements (last visited Sept. \n27  5, 2022); League of United American Citizens of Arizona (LULAC) v. Reagan, 2:17-cv-\n04102-DGC, Dkt. No. 37 (D. Ariz. June 18, 2018) (“the LULAC Consent Decree”). \n28 \n16 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 19 of 68\ncounty recorders to locate DPOC so that voter registration applicants could be registered for \n1 \n2  all elections, and not only as federal-only voters. It was not imposed as part of an effort to \n3 \ninvestigate the voter’s current citizenship status. Per the 2019 Election Procedures Manual, \n4 \na county recorder was required to register an applicant as a “full-ballot” voter for the next \n5 \nelection if: \n6 \n7  a.  The  registrant  provide[d]  DPOC  with  or  after  submission  of  the \nregistrant’s voter registration application; or \n8 \nb.  The County Recorder acquire[d] DPOC on the registrant’s behalf, \nincluding  from  MVD  records  or  the  statewide  voter  registration \n9 \ndatabase. \n10   \n2019 EPM at 6 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-166(F)). The requirement to conduct such a \n11 \n12  DPOC search for registration applicants using Arizona’s registration form was part of a \n13 \nconsent decree entered in League of United American Citizens of Arizona (LULAC) v. \n14 \nReagan, 2:17-cv-04102-DGC, Dkt. No. 37 (D. Ariz. June 18, 2018) (the “LULAC Consent \n15 \nDecree”). \n16 \n17  32.  HB 2492 seeks to override that preexisting federal consent decree. When the \n18  new law takes effect in 2023, an Arizona voter registration form9 that is submitted without \n19 \nDPOC must be rejected by the county recorder’s office, without exception, and without a \n20 \nrequirement to search databases for already-existing evidence of citizenship. A registrar’s \n21 \n22  failure to reject the form has been made a Class 6 felony. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-121.01(C), \n23 \nas amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4. The registration applicant must be notified \n24 \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  9  This  is  the  state  voter  registration  form  in  Arizona: \nhttps://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/voter_registration_form.pdf.   \n28 \n17 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 20 of 68\nand afforded an opportunity to provide DPOC, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-134(B). \n1 \n2  That statute provides that \n3 \n[i]f the information on the registration form is incomplete or illegible and the \ncounty recorder is not able to process the registration form, the county recorder \n4 \nshall notify the applicant within ten business days of receipt of the registration \n5  form, shall specify the missing or illegible information and, if the missing or \nillegible information includes any of the information prescribed by § 16-\n6 \n121.01, subsection A or C, shall state that the registration cannot be completed \n7  until the information is supplied. If the missing or illegible information is \nsupplied before 7:00 p.m. on election day, that person is deemed to have been \n8 \nregistered on the date the registration was first received. \n \n9 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-134(B) (as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 6). \n10   \nB.  The New Citizenship Investigation Provisions Under HB 2492 and HB 2243 \n11 \n12  33.  HB 2492 imposes a set of new citizenship documentation and investigation \n13 \nprocedures. First, HB 2492 mandates that county recorders investigate the citizenship status \n14 \nof new registration applicants using the federal registration form if the submitted form is not \n15 \naccompanied by DPOC. Ultimately, Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-121.01(D), as amended by 2022 \n16 \n17  Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4, in conjunction with HB 2243, will constitute an end run around \n18 \nthe federal voter registration form. \n19 \n34.  HB  2492  imposes  an  unqualified,  unrestrained,  and  backward-looking \n20 \ninvestigative mandate on country recorders, by instructing county recorders to “use all \n21 \n22  available resources to verify the citizenship status of the applicant and at a minimum [to] \n23  compare the information available on the application for registration with the following, \n24 \nprovided the county has access”: (1) AZDOT databases of Arizona driver licenses and state \n25 \nidentification cards; (2) Social Security Administration databases; (3) U.S. Citizenship and \n26 \nImmigration Services Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (“SAVE”) Program \n27 \n28 \n18 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 21 of 68\nsystem,  “if  practicable”;  (4)  a  National  Association  for  Public  Health  Statistics  and \n1 \n2  Information Systems Electronic Verification of Vital Events System; and (5) “[a]ny other \n3 \nstate, city, town, county or federal database and any other database relating to voter \n4 \nregistration to which the county recorder or office in charge of elections has access, \n5 \nincluding an Electronic Registration Information Center [ERIC] database.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. \n6 \n7  § 16-121.01(D), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4 (emphasis added). \n8 \nEffectively, this means county recorders must consult every government database at their \n9 \ndisposal, including but not limited to the above government and voter registration databases, \n10 \nand any non-governmental database concerning voter registration including but not limited \n11 \n12  to ERIC databases. No criteria or standards govern such non-governmental databases. \n13 \nAnyone could create a database with unreliable or selective data; the statutory command to \n14 \nrely on such databases contains no limiting principle. \n15 \n35.  After all government databases are searched for the applicant’s citizenship \n16 \n17  status, the applicant is treated in one of three ways, depending on the outcomes of these \n18 \nsearches: \n19 \na.  In  Scenario  1,  if  the  county  recorder  “matches  the  applicant  with \n20 \ninformation that verifies the applicant is a United States citizen, is otherwise \n21 \n22  qualified  as  prescribed  by  Section  16-101  and  has  met  the  other \n23 \nrequirements of this section, the applicant shall be properly registered.” \n24 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-121.01(E), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. \n25 \n99 § 4. Such applicants are registered as “full-ballot” voters. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n19 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 22 of 68\nb.  In Scenario 2, if the county recorder’s office “matches the applicant with \n1 \n2  information that the applicant is not a United States citizen,” then the \n3 \ncounty recorder must “reject the application, notify the applicant that the \n4 \napplication was rejected because the applicant is not a United States citizen \n5 \nand forward the application to the county attorney and Attorney General for \n6 \n7  investigation.” Id. (emphasis added). This provision does not enumerate or \n8 \notherwise  specify  what  “information”  establishes  that  a  registration \n9 \napplicant “is not a United States citizen.” Nor does it reference the notice \n10 \nand curing procedure outlined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-134(B).  While \n11 \n12  requiring notice to the applicant of the rejection, by its terms, HB 2492 does \n13 \nnot  afford  the  registrant  an  opportunity  to  cure  by  attesting  to  their \n14 \ncitizenship  or  even  providing  proof  of  citizenship  before  being \n15 \nautomatically referred to the county attorney and Attorney General for \n16 \n17  investigation. \n18 \nc.  In Scenario 3, if the county recorder “is unable to match the applicant with \n19 \nappropriate citizenship information”—a vague and undefined phrase not \n20 \nused anywhere else in Arizona’s election laws—the county recorder must \n21 \n22  “notify the applicant that the county recorder . . . could not verify that the \n23 \napplicant  is  a  United  States  citizen  and  that  the  applicant  will  not be \n24 \nqualified to vote in a presidential election or by mail with an early ballot in \n25 \nany election until satisfactory evidence of citizenship is provided.” Id. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n20 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 23 of 68\n(emphasis  added).  Such  voters  will  only  be  permitted  to  vote  in \n1 \n2  congressional elections. \n3 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-121.01(E), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4. This last \n4 \nprovision narrows access to voting based on the absence of affirmative information of \n5 \ncitizenship.  \n6 \n7  36.  HB 2492 also requires county recorders to “record the efforts made to verify \n8 \nan applicant’s citizenship status.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-121.01(F), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. \n9 \nSess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4. Additionally, if the county recorder “fails to attempt to verify the \n10 \ncitizenship status of an applicant” according to these procedures and “knowingly causes the \n11 \n12  applicant to be registered and it is later determined that the applicant was not a United States \n13 \ncitizen at the time of registration,” the county recorder has committed a Class 6 felony. Id. \n14 \n37.  HB 2492 requires a similar process to investigate currently registered Arizona \n15 \nvoters  who  have  not  previously  provided  DPOC  and  can  only  vote  in  congressional \n16 \n17  elections.  For  such  congressional-only  voters,  the  challenged  law  requires  Defendant \n18 \nBrnovich to engage in the same wide-ranging database reviews to identify voters who are \n19 \npurportedly not U.S. citizens and “prosecute individuals who are found to not be United \n20 \nStates citizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. 16-143(D), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § \n21 \n22  7. To initiate this process, the Secretary of State and Arizona’s fifteen county recorders are \n23 \nrequired to provide to the Attorney General a list and the applications of all registered \n24 \ncongressional-only voters who have not satisfied the DPOC requirement. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § \n25 \n16-143(A), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99, § 7. The Attorney General is then \n26 \nrequired to search any federal, state, or local government database and any other voter \n27 \n28 \n21 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 24 of 68\nregistration  database,  i.e.,  the  same  citizenship  investigation  procedures  that  county \n1 \n2  recorders are required to use when a federal registration form is submitted without DPOC. \n3 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-143(B), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99, § 7. Finally, the \n4 \nAttorney General is required “to prosecute individuals who are found to not be United States \n5 \ncitizens” for registration fraud under Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-182, and to submit a report before \n6 \n7  March 31, 2023, detailing any findings. Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-143(D)-(E), as enacted by \n8 \n2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99, § 7.  \n9 \n38.  One plausible reading of Section 16-143 is that it requires a one-time-only \n10 \ninvestigation of currently registered congressional-only voters via database verification, but \n11 \n12  it  may  well  be  interpreted  to  authorize  the  Attorney  General  to  investigate  currently \n13 \nregistered  voters’  citizenship  status  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Either  way,  this  suit  seeks \n14 \ninjunctive relief against these provisions, as they suffer from the same constitutional defects \n15 \nas the Citizenship Investigation Provisions directed at new voter registration applicants \n16 \n17  using the federal registration form. \n18 \n39.  HB 2243 supplements HB 2492 by imposing a variety of vague, restrictive, \n19 \nand arbitrary voter list maintenance procedures. Under HB 2243, “when the county recorder \n20 \nobtains information pursuant to this section and confirms that the person registered is not a \n21 \n22  United States citizen,” HB 2243 requires the removal of voters from the statewide voter \n23 \nregistration database. Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-165(A)(10), modified 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. \n24 \n370, § 2.10  \n25 \n26                                                \n10 HB 2492 contained a prior version of this provision. See H.B. 2492 § 8 (adding a new \n27 \nparagraph 10 to § 16-165(A) requiring county recorders to cancel a registration “When the \ncounty recorder receives and confirms information that the person registered is not a United \n28 \n22 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 25 of 68\n40.  Newly created Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-165(F), 16-165(G), 16-165(H), 16-\n1 \n2  165(I), 16-165(J) compel the Secretary of State and the county recorders to match voter \n3 \nregistration data against every federal, state, and local database to which they have access. \n4 \nThe Secretary of State is required to perform monthly comparisons against the Arizona \n5 \ndriver license database maintained by Arizona DOT. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(F), as enacted \n6 \n7  by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 370, § 2. The county recorders are required to perform monthly \n8 \ncomparisons against the Social Security Administration database. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-\n9 \n165(G), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 370, § 2.  \n10 \n41.  Section  16-165(H)  creates  a  regime  virtually  guaranteed  to  result  in \n11 \n12  discriminatory and unequal treatment in the guise of voter eligibility verification. That \n13 \nprovision reads as follows: \n14 \nTo the extent practicable, each month the county recorder shall compare \npersons who are registered to vote in that county and who the county recorder \n15 \nhas reason to believe are not United States citizens and persons who are \nregistered to vote without satisfactory evidence of citizenship as prescribed by \n16 \nSection  16-166  with  the  Systematic  Alien  Verification  for  Entitlements \nprogram  maintained  by  the  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration \n17 \nServices to verify the citizenship status of the persons registered. \n \n18 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 370, § 2 (emphasis \n19 \nadded). This provision divides registered voters into two groups: voters whom a county \n20 \n21  recorder  “has  reason  to  believe”  lack  U.S.  citizenship  and  voters  who—for  whatever \n22 \nreason—do not arouse the suspicion of a county recorder. This new law subjects “suspect” \n23 \nvoters to extra, unwarranted scrutiny and comparison against the SAVE system, based on \n24 \nnothing more than a county recorder’s suspicions or biases. The law includes no list of \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  States citizen.”). HB 2243’s version of Section 16-165(A)(10) fully replaces the prior \nversion in HB 2492. \n28 \n23 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 26 of 68\nindicia or criteria that would provide a predicate for the county recorder’s “reason to \n1 \n2  believe.” Section 16-165(H) thus invites county recorders to treat registered voters in a non-\n3 \nuniform and/or discriminatory manner based on the voter’s race, ethnicity, national origin, \n4 \ndress, English proficiency, or any other constitutionally impermissible criteria. It has been \n5 \nmany decades since election officials in any state have been given official sanction to act on \n6 \n7  their subjective suspicions and prejudices. \n8 \n42.  Further, county recorders must compare registered voters’ data against the \n9 \nElectronic Verification of Vital Events System maintained by a National Association for \n10 \nPublic Health Statistics and Information Systems, for any registered voters who have not \n11 \n12  supplied proof of citizenship. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(I), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. \n13 \nLaws ch. 370, § 2. \n14 \n43.  Finally, county recorders must also utilize any other municipal, county, state \n15 \nor federal database to which they have access “to confirm information obtained that requires \n16 \n17  cancellation of registrations.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(J), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. \n18 \nLaws ch. 370, § 2. \n19 \n44.  HB 2492 and HB 2243 alike do not specify what type, set, or combination of \n20 \n“information” establishes that a registered voter “is not a United States citizen”; nor do they \n21 \n22  address what combination of “information” allows the conclusions that an individual in a \n23 \ndatabase is the same individual as a particular person on the voter list. Nor do these \n24 \nprovisions  acknowledge,  let  alone  address,  these  flagged  registered  voters’  likely \n25 \nnaturalization subsequent to the government record’s creation but before their registration \n26 \nas an Arizona voter attesting to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. These vague \n27 \n28 \n24 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 27 of 68\ninstructions will inevitably cause arbitrary and disparate treatment of registered voters and \n1 \n2  thereby arbitrarily allocate the right to vote. Some, but not all, county recorders and their \n3 \nstaff members will rely on such unreliable information. Other county recorders and their \n4 \nstaff members will investigate more thoroughly to discover subsequent naturalizations. The \n5 \nresult will be the arbitrary and disparate treatment of naturalized registered voters. \n6 \n7  45.  A nearly identical registration cancellation provision appeared in HB 2617, \n8 \nwhich was vetoed this past session by Governor Doug Ducey. Governor Ducey’s veto \n9 \nstatement cited the law’s “subjectivity,” “vague[ness],” the “lacks [ of] any guidance for \n10 \nhow a county recorder would confirm such a determination,” and “a lack of guardrails \n11 \n12  against false claims.”11 All of those same fatal constitutional defects that made HB 2617 \n13 \nvague and vulnerable to arbitrary and disparate application, as well as abuse by third parties \n14 \nmaking false or unfounded accusations, are found in HB 2492 and have not been eliminated \n15 \nfrom HB 2243 by the amended language. \n16 \n17  46.  HB 2492 and HB 2243’s use of the phrase “information that the person . . . is \n18 \nnot  a  United  States  citizen”  renders  these  statutes  unconstitutional.  While  Arizona’s \n19 \npreexisting DPOC law enumerates the specific forms of proof that a voter registration \n20 \napplicant can provide to establish U.S. citizenship, Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-166(F), HB 2492 \n21 \n22  does not enumerate what specific “information” establishes that a voter registration applicant \n23 \nusing the federal form or a registered voter “is not a U.S. citizen.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-\n24 \n121.01(E), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4; Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-\n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  11 Letter from Governor Ducey to Rusty Bowers, Speaker of the Arizona State House of \nRepresentatives, (May 27, 2022), https://www.azleg.gov/govlettr/55leg/2r/hb2617.pdf.  \n28 \n25 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 28 of 68\n165(A)(10), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 8. The former law creates an \n1 \n2  objective requirement with specificity; HB 2492 and HB 2243 contain only a vague standard \n3 \nthat leaves registration applicants’ and registered voters’ citizenship status to the discretion \n4 \nand subjective, arbitrary determinations of Defendant Hobbs, Defendant Brnovich, the \n5 \ncounty recorders, and their respective staffs. As used in HB 2492, this open-ended phrase \n6 \n7  appears to embrace any “information”—whether it is current or years old, recorded in a \n8 \ngovernment  database  or  merely  verbally  communicated  to  a  county  recorder’s  office, \n9 \ncorroborated by other sources or not, provided in a sworn statement or not—researched by \n10 \nanyone or any entity regardless of motivation, reliability, or objectivity. HB 2243’s similar \n11 \n12  reliance on unspecified “information” to disenfranchise voters is little better. While the \n13 \nremoval provision, Section 16-165(A)(10), formally requires confirmation, the statute does \n14 \nnot define what constitutes confirmation. Similarly, written or verbal third-party accusations \n15 \nare sufficient to trigger a discriminatory database comparison under Section 16-165(H). \n16 \n17  Both challenged laws remain vague, arbitrary, and susceptible to abuse. HB 2492 and HB \n18 \n2243’s  vague  standards  will  inevitably  result  in  inconsistent  and  irreconcilable \n19 \ndeterminations on voter registration applicants and registered voters’ citizenship status. \n20 \n47.  Naturalized voters will inexorably be harmed by HB 2492 and HB 2243’s \n21 \n22  vesting of unfettered discretion in county recorders to determine what types or combinations \n23 \nof “information” establish that a voter registration applicant or registered voter “is not a U.S. \n24 \ncitizen.” Some county recorders and their staff members will seize upon any information or \n25 \ndata that a voter registration applicant or registered voter lacked U.S. citizenship at some \n26 \npoint in the past and use that information to reject the application and refer that individual \n27 \n28 \n26 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 29 of 68\nto law enforcement or to remove the voter from the rolls. Such officials and their staff may—\n1 \n2  under the statutes—even rely upon unverified and unsubstantiated “information” from \n3 \nprivate individuals or political organizations as to individual registered voters’ citizenship \n4 \nand subject these voters to extra scrutiny under Section 16-165(H). \n5 \n48.  HB 2492 and HB 2243 were enacted, according to statements by the bill \n6 \n7  sponsors, to override the LULAC consent decree, to require proof of citizenship from federal-\n8 \nonly voters “to ensure that non-citizens are not voting in Arizona elections,” “ensure that \n9 \nonly qualified applicants are properly registered and voting in our elections”12 and, as to the \n10 \nprovisions imported from HB 2617 into HB 2243, “require[ ] on the front end that only \n11 \n12  qualified applicants are properly registered to vote, and then require[ ] regular maintenance \n13  to ensure individuals no longer qualified . . . are regularly removed.”13 But the Citizenship \n14 \nInvestigation Provisions do not require county recorders to assess whether the applicant has \n15 \nin fact naturalized subsequent to their AZDOT or public assistance office transaction prior \n16 \n17  to registering to vote. Nor was there any basis presented to the legislature to indicate that the \n18 \ntens of thousands of federal-only voters who attested to their citizenship were not in fact \n19 \nU.S. citizens. Thus, the Challenged Provisions are not consistent with these laws’ purported \n20 \nobjectives.  \n21 \n22 \n                                              \n23 \n12 See, e.g., Statement of Representative Jake Hoffman, House Committee of the Whole, \n(February  24,  2022),  available  at \n24 \nhttps://www.azleg.gov/videoplayer/?eventID=2022021134&startStreamAt=6188;  \nStatements of Representative Jake Hoffman and Greg Blackie, Arizona Free Enterprise \n25 \nClub,  House  Committee  on  Government  and  Elections  (Feb.  16,  2022),  available  at \nhttps://www.azleg.gov/videoplayer/?eventID=2022021083&startStreamAt=25948.   \n26 \n13 Statements of Representative Joseph Chaplik and Greg Blackie, of the Arizona Free \n27  Enterprise Club, as to HB 2617, Senate Government Committee (March 14, 2022), available \nat https://www.azleg.gov/videoplayer/?eventID=2022031059&startStreamAt=4502.  \n28 \n27 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 30 of 68\n49.  Other county recorders statewide or other staff members within the same \n1 \n2  county recorder office will interpret the same government databases and other information \n3 \ndifferently, remaining skeptical of any reliance on stale, outdated government data or \n4 \nunverified and unsubstantiated accounts of registration applicants’ and registered voters’ \n5 \ncitizenship. These officials and their staff would be well-justified in refusing to credit any \n6 \n7  such information of alleged non-citizenship, given the inherent failure to account for the \n8 \npossibility of subsequent naturalization.  \n9 \n50.  Absent a comprehensive and up-to-date list of all naturalized U.S. citizens, \n10 \ncompletely accurate verification of current U.S. citizenship status is not possible. There is \n11 \n12  no database that has current, up-to-date citizenship status information for all residents of the \n13 \nUnited  States  or  Arizona.  Databases  that  allegedly  contain  some  citizenship  status \n14 \ninformation are based on transactions or events that took place at some point in the past (and \n15 \npotentially  the  distant  past),  e.g.,  an  original  application  for  a  driver’s  license.  Even \n16 \n17  assuming the accuracy of database information at the time the record was created as to the \n18 \nperson in fact on the record, that information is but a snapshot frozen in time, and has no \n19 \nreasonable  relationship  to  a  registered  voter’s  current  citizenship  status.  Further,  such \n20 \ndatabases are not comprehensive, making their use necessarily selective and nonuniform. \n21 \n22  The law does not specify safeguards to ensure an accurate match. \n23 \n51.  Further, a number of the databases listed in HB 2492 and HB 2243 are known \n24 \nto contain outdated and inaccurate information on citizenship status. \n25 \n52.  For example, SAVE is designed to verify immigration status in order to \n26 \ndetermine one’s eligibility for various public benefits. SAVE is a massive compilation of \n27 \n28 \n28 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 31 of 68\nrecords  from  numerous  databases  about  individuals  who  have  interacted  with  the \n1 \n2  immigration system over the years, such as immigrants who have obtained green cards or \n3 \nvisas, and those who have become naturalized citizens.14 It is not a definitive or accurate list \n4 \nof U.S. citizens.15 SAVE is not a universal citizen database and does not purport to be \n5 \ncomplete or to include many individuals.16  \n6 \n7  53.  On information and belief, SAVE does not contain information on citizens born \n8 \nin the United States and thus can only provide information on voters who are naturalized \n9 \ncitizens (and some derived citizens,17 see infra) and whose information may be collected in \n10 \nSAVE. As a result, under the new scheme, only Arizona’s naturalized and derived U.S. \n11 \n12  citizens would be at risk of rejection, removal, or prosecution based on the information \n13 \ncontained in SAVE. \n14 \n54.  On information and belief, another source of inaccuracy is that SAVE cannot \n15 \nverify derived citizens, individuals who acquired U.S. citizenship by virtue of their parents’ \n16 \n17  naturalization while they were minors, unless they applied for Certificates of Citizenship. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n                                              \n21  14 See Corrected Declaration and Expert Report of Daniel A. Smith ¶ 42 n.19, Arcia v. \nDetzner, No. 13-CV-4095-EFM-TJJ, Dkt. No. 76-1 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 24, 2012). \n22 \n15  See  id.;  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Security,  Privacy  Impact  Assessment  for  the \n23 \nSystematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program, (Aug. 26, 2011) at 3, \n24  available at http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_uscis_save.pdf. \n16 See id. \n25 \n17 Derived citizenship refers to citizenship conveyed to children through the naturalization \n26 \nof parents or, under certain circumstances, to foreign-born children adopted by U.S. citizen \n27  parents,  provided  certain  conditions  are  met.  See  https://www.uscis.gov/policy-\nmanual/volume-12-part-h-chapter-3#3#4 \n28 \n29 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 32 of 68\nHowever, a Certificate of Citizenship is an optional form: a person who automatically obtains \n1 \n2  citizenship is not required to file an Application for Certificate of Citizenship.18 \n3 \n55.  Indeed,  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”),  which  administers \n4 \nSAVE, itself acknowledges that the SAVE system is a non-definitive source for determining \n5 \ncitizenship. On information and belief, the memoranda of agreement between SAVE and \n6 \n7  jurisdictions that use its information for voter registration purposes, including Arizona, \n8 \nacknowledge that the inability to verify a person’s citizenship in SAVE does not necessarily \n9 \nmean that the person is not a citizen, and that the information in SAVE may need to be \n10 \ncorrected. On information and belief, those memoranda require users to provide registrants \n11 \n12  who do not verify as a citizen with adequate written notice that their citizenship could not \n13 \nbe verified and the information necessary to contact DHS-USCIS so that they can correct \n14 \ntheir records if necessary. By requiring the opportunity to correct their records, DHS-USCIS \n15 \nacknowledges that errors exist in the information SAVE provides.  SAVE should not be used \n16 \n17  to deprive a person of the right to vote or to initiate prosecution for alleged unlawful voting \n18 \nor registration as a non-citizen. \n19 \n56.  Because HB 2492 and HB 2243 are devoid of any rules or criteria on how to \n20 \nevaluate the databases against which it mandates comparison of voter registration applicants’ \n21 \n22  data, and fail to take account of the possibility of the applicant’s likely naturalization as a \n23 \nU.S.  citizen  subsequent  to  that  outdated  government  transaction  record  but  prior  to \n24 \nregistering as an Arizona voter, the Citizenship Investigation Provisions will result in the \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  18 U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs. Policy Manual, vol. 12, pt.

Such arbitrary and disparate treatment \n4 \nconcerning the allocation of the right to vote will be the inevitable consequence of HB 2492 \n5 \nand HB 2243. \n6 \n7  57.  In sum, the Citizenship Investigation Provisions will result in arbitrary and \n8 \ndisparate treatment of naturalized voter registration applicants and naturalized registered \n9 \nvoters, both within counties and statewide. \n10 \nC.Arizona’s Proof of Residence Requirement Under HB 2492 \n11 \n12  58.  HB 2492 also imposes a new documentary proof of residence (“DPOR”) \n13 \nrequirement on all voter registration applicants, except those registering pursuant to Ariz. \n14 \nRev. Stat. § 16-103 because they are temporarily absent from Arizona, or those covered \n15 \nunder the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986. Ariz. Rev. Stat. \n16 \n17  § 16-123. \n18 \n59.  Under HB 2492, “a person who registers to vote shall provide an identifying \n19 \ndocument that establishes proof of location or residence.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-123, as \n20 \namended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 5. HB 2492 also makes DPOR one of the \n21 \n22  required elements for valid registration. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-121.01(A), as amended by \n23 \n2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4. The list of identifying documents is anything listed in the \n24 \nvoter ID statutes at Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-579(A)(1) that contains the voter’s name and current \n25 \naddress. That list includes the following: \n26 \n(a) A valid form of identification that bears the photograph, name and address \n27 \nof the elector that reasonably appear to be the same as the name and address \n28 \n31 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 34 of 68\nin  the  precinct  register,  including  an  Arizona  driver  license,  an  Arizona \n1 \nnonoperating identification license, a tribal enrollment card or other form of \n2  tribal identification or a United States federal, state or local government issued \nidentification. Identification is deemed valid unless it can be determined on its \n3 \nface that it has expired. \n \n4 \n(b) Two different items that contain the name and address of the elector that \n5  reasonably appear to be the same as the name and address in the precinct \nregister, including a utility bill, a bank or credit union statement that is dated \n6 \nwithin  ninety  days  of  the  date  of  the  election,  a  valid  Arizona  vehicle \n7  registration, an Arizona vehicle insurance card, an Indian census card, tribal \nenrollment card or other form of tribal identification, a property tax statement, \n8 \na recorder's certificate, a voter registration card, a valid United States federal, \nstate or local government issued identification or any mailing that is labeled \n9 \nas “official election material”. Identification is deemed valid unless it can be \n10  determined on its face that it has expired. \n \n11 \n(c) A valid form of identification that bears the photograph, name and address \n12  of  the  elector  except  that  if  the  address  on  the  identification  does  not \nreasonably appear to be the same as the address in the precinct register or the \n13 \nidentification is a valid United States military identification card or a valid \nUnited States passport and does not bear an address, the identification must be \n14 \naccompanied by one of the items listed in subdivision (b) of this paragraph. \n15   \nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 16-579(A)(1). Even prior to the enactment of this new DPOR requirement, \n16 \n17  all in-person voters in Arizona already presented at least one form of identification that \n18 \nshows their current address. \n19 \n60.  This new requirement also permits the use of “a valid and unexpired Arizona \n20 \ndriver license or nonoperating identification number” in lieu of DPOR, but it must be \n21 \n22  “properly verified” before it satisfies the requirement. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-123, as amended \n23  by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 5. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n32 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 35 of 68\n61.  By contrast, the federal voter registration form required by the NVRA and \n1 \n2  promulgated by the Election Assistance Commission does not require documentary proof of \n3 \nresidence for Arizona voters.19 \n4 \n62.  Arizona’s documentary proof of residence requirement, as applied to federal \n5 \nvoter registration form applicants, fails to accord with the NVRA as interpreted by Justice \n6 \n7  Scalia’s 7-2 majority opinion in ITCA. That opinion held that Arizona must accept and use—\n8 \nas is and without additional requirements—the federal voter registration form promulgated \n9 \nby the EAC for registration in federal elections. Because the EAC’s form does not require \n10 \ndocumentary proof of residence for Arizona voters to register, it cannot be required of \n11 \n12  Arizona federal form registrants for registration in federal elections. \n13 \nPLAINTIFFS’ INJURIES \n14 \n63.

Plaintiff’s \n4 \ncanvassers will do about 2 to 3 rounds of door-knocking and a final round for GOTV. By \n5 \nElection Day, they will have knocked on approximately 96,550 doors. \n6 \n7  65.  Poder Latinx plans to continue its voter registration and civic engagement \n8 \noperations into the future beyond the 2022 election. \n9 \n66.  Poder Latinx currently uses Arizona’s state voter registration paper form \n10 \nexclusively,  but  once  HB  2492  takes  effect,  it  will  be  compelled  to  use  the  federal \n11 \n12  registration form as well to serve Latinx communities in Arizona. Currently, under the \n13 \nLULAC  Consent  Decree,  voter  registration  applicants  submitting  the  Arizona  voter \n14 \nregistration form can still be registered to vote, notwithstanding the lack of DPOC. Once HB \n15 \n2492 takes effect, that will no longer be true; Arizona registration forms submitted without \n16 \n17  DPOC will be rejected without any opportunity for voters to provide, or for county recorders \n18 \nto locate, DPOC for the voter. This legal change will force a shift in Poder Latinx’s \n19 \noperations, diverting money, resources, and staff time to print off federal voter registration \n20 \nforms, educate and train staff and volunteers on how to use the federal form, create new \n21 \n22  public-facing educational materials and flyers to guide voter registration applicants using \n23 \nthe federal form, and create new public-facing, bilingual materials to educate registration \n24 \napplicants it assists. Poder Latinx will need to educate the naturalized and/or limited English \n25 \nproficient applicants it serves on the effects HB 2492 and HB 2243 will have on their ability \n26 \n27 \n28 \n34 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 37 of 68\nto register to vote in Arizona with either the state or federal form, with or without DPOC, \n1 \n2  and their ability to stay registered to vote. \n3 \n67.  Poder Latinx will need to hire an additional Quality Control Agent to reach \n4 \nout to voters who may be erroneously flagged as non-citizens. This staff member will need \n5 \nto keep track of voters Poder Latinx has helped register to vote and then check if those voters \n6 \n7  ultimately  made  it  onto  the  rolls.  The  additional  cost  of  hiring  this  person  will  be \n8 \napproximately $44,000. Due to the nature of this issue, Poder Latinx foresees that this agent \n9 \nwill need to continue working even after the voter registration program has ended to keep \n10 \ntrack of voter registrations and to try to ensure that these voters’ registrations are not \n11 \n12  erroneously cancelled. \n13 \n68.  HB 2492 and HB 2243’s Citizenship Investigation Provisions will upend \n14 \nPoder Latinx’s voter registration activities in Arizona and stymie the organization’s ability \n15 \nto fulfill its core mission to help register and engage eligible Latinx voters and keep them \n16 \n17  registered  and  engaged.  Because  HB  2492  and  HB  2243  impose  a  new  citizenship \n18 \ninvestigation protocol for each voter who submits a federal form without DPOC and that \n19 \nprotocol relies on old government transaction data, the challenged law will necessarily result \n20 \nin countless naturalized voters being erroneously flagged as non-citizens, the rejection of \n21 \n22  their registration forms, and their referral to law enforcement. Federal voter registration \n23 \nforms  will  be  treated  in  an  arbitrary  and  disparate  manner  and  without  affording  the \n24 \napplicants an opportunity to provide DPOC, and registration forms submitted by duly \n25 \nnaturalized U.S. citizens will be rejected in error. This unlawful procedure will force Poder \n26 \nLatinx to divert money and resources, as well as staff and paid canvasser time, to re-register \n27 \n28 \n35 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 38 of 68\neligible voters whose applications were unlawfully rejected. This wastes Poder Latinx’s \n1 \n2  time, money, and other resources and undermines its core mission to expand the electorate, \n3 \nregister and engage more eligible Latinx voters, keep those voters registered and engaged, \n4 \nand encourage the Latinx community to participate fully in their democracy. \n5 \n69.  Further, some portion of the registration applicants whom Poder Latinx assists \n6 \n7  through  its  voter  registration  drives  will  clear  the  front-end  citizenship  investigation \n8 \nprocedures only to be later erroneously flagged as non-citizens in the Attorney General’s \n9 \nback-end citizenship investigation, erroneously identified as a non-citizen and removed from \n10 \nthe rolls by the county recorders, and/or subjected to law enforcement investigation and \n11 \n12  prosecution. Therefore, the back-end citizenship investigations conducted by the Attorney \n13 \nGeneral and the county recorder’s removal of voters based upon “information that the person \n14 \nregistered is not a United States citizen” will also result in the arbitrary and disparate \n15 \ntreatment  of  registered  voters.  These  procedures  for  investigating  citizenship  status, \n16 \n17  cancelling voters based upon outdated or unverified “information,” and referring them for \n18 \nprosecution will force Poder Latinx to divert money, resources, and staff and paid canvasser \n19 \ntime to re-register individuals who have been unlawfully removed from the rolls. This \n20 \nwastes Poder Latinx’s time, money, and other resources and undermines its core mission to \n21 \n22  expand the electorate, register and engage more eligible Latinx voters, keep those voters \n23 \nregistered  and  engaged,  and  encourage  these  communities  to participate  fully  in  their \n24 \ndemocracy. \n25 \n70.  As a consequence of the Challenged Provisions, Poder Latinx will need to \n26 \ndevote more resources, staff time, and money to training its canvassers so they can be \n27 \n28 \n36 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 39 of 68\nprepared to answer questions about Arizona’s singular dual-track registration system under \n1 \n2  the HB 2492 and HB 2243 regime, the risks the Challenged Provisions pose to their \n3 \ncontinued registration, and the threat of being identified as a non-citizen and referred for \n4 \ninvestigation and prosecution, especially for naturalized registration applicants. HB 2492 \n5 \nand HB 2243 will vastly increase the complexity of canvasser training and voter education. \n6 \n7  Accordingly, it will deter potential canvassers and make it harder for Poder Latinx to meet \n8 \nits recruitment and hiring goals. Poder Latinx will also need to divert resources, staff time, \n9 \nand  money  to  make  and  print  more  educational  materials,  including  flyers  and  other \n10 \nresources it would not have generated otherwise, and to increase its staff capacity to field \n11 \n12  the numerous questions and concerns they will receive from Latinx community members \n13 \nwho attempted to register to vote through a Poder Latinx voter registration drive. And to \n14 \ncommunicate effectively with the Latinx community about the new requirements imposed \n15 \nby HB 2492 and HB 2243, Poder Latinx will need to use translation services at substantial \n16 \n17  cost to the organization that it would not have utilized otherwise. These resources will be \n18 \ndiverted from Poder Latinx’s other core mission activities.  \n19 \n71.  Further, as HB 2492 and HB 2243 ensnare naturalized U.S. citizens who \n20 \nregistered through Plaintiff’s voter registration drives, Poder Latinx will suffer severe \n21 \n22  reputational harm in the communities where it has worked and continues to work to secure \n23 \ntrust. HB 2492 and HB 2243’s arbitrary and error-ridden processes will result in registration \n24 \nform rejections, the mandatory cancellation of registrations, referrals to law enforcement for \n25 \ninvestigation, and mandatory prosecution. Because these voters have placed their trust in \n26 \nPoder Latinx’s knowledge as to the proper and lawful way to register and stay registered to \n27 \n28 \n37 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 40 of 68\nvote, such consequences will badly undermine voters’ trust in Poder Latinx as a reliable and \n1 \n2  knowledgeable organization. Not knowing the details and effects of HB 2492 and HB 2243, \n3 \ncommunity members will distrust Poder Latinx, thinking that its canvassers did not register \n4 \nthem correctly. These negative outcomes will also severely undermine voters’ faith and trust \n5 \nin the electoral system, thereby undermining Plaintiff’s mission to promote and foster \n6 \n7  sustained  civic  engagement  in  Latinx  communities  throughout  Arizona.  Some  voters \n8 \nregistered by Poder Latinx will refuse to engage in the voter registration process again, even \n9 \nif they are not ultimately investigated and prosecuted. Others who are persuaded to go \n10 \nthrough the registration process again will nevertheless have less trust in Plaintiff and the \n11 \n12  election system going forward. \n13 \n72.  Poder Latinx will also be injured by the new DPOR requirement. HB 2492 \n14 \nwill force Poder Latinx to divert money, resources, and staff and paid canvasser time to \n15 \ncomply with the new DPOR requirement. To fulfill its core mission, Poder Latinx will need \n16 \n17  to inform new voter registration applicants about the DPOR requirement and assist them \n18 \nwith compliance, particularly if they lack an Arizona driver’s license or state ID number, \n19 \nwhich if “properly verified,” will fully satisfy the POR requirement. To that end, Poder \n20 \nLatinx will be compelled to modify its training of canvassers and update all of its training \n21 \n22  resources and materials. Poder Latinx will also need to update its handouts for voters and \n23 \ncreate and print a new handout listing the acceptable forms of DPOR. These resources will \n24 \nbe diverted from Poder Latinx’s core mission civic engagement activities.  \n25 \n73.  HB 2492 authorizes the county recorders to reject forms if they are submitted \n26 \nwithout DPOR. DPOR will effectively eliminate Poder Latinx’s ability to collect completed \n27 \n28 \n38 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 41 of 68\nvoter registration forms, where the voter registration applicant does not have an Arizona \n1 \n2  driver’s license or state ID number. It is not viable for Poder Latinx to scan or photocopy \n3 \nDPOR. Community members, even if they have valid DPOR on them at the time, do not \n4 \ntrust others with their documents. Community skepticism and discomfort with handing over \n5 \nDPOR makes it impossible to facilitate this part of the process. Accordingly, the best that \n6 \n7  Poder Latinx registration drive canvassers will be able to do under these circumstances is to \n8 \nhelp applicants complete the form and the process themselves. Instead of collecting a \n9 \ncompleted form that can be submitted to the county recorder’s office, for any voter that lacks \n10 \nan Arizona driver’s license or state ID number, Poder Latinx’s canvassers will need to \n11 \n12  provide applicants with a bilingual flyer listing the forms of acceptable DPOR and send them \n13 \non their way with instructions on how to complete the form and submit it with a photocopied \n14 \nform of DPOR. Poder Latinx does contact applicants who have incomplete voter registration \n15 \nforms within 24 hours of collection to help them with missing information or documentation \n16 \n17  to complete the registration process. Because more forms will be incomplete due to a lack \n18 \nof DPOR, Poder Latinx will need to increase its quality control efforts compared to before \n19 \nHB 2492 was enacted. Accordingly, this new DPOR requirement will seriously undermine \n20 \nand curtail third-party voter registration drive activity. \n21 \n22  74.  In  Poder  Latinx’s  experience,  community  voter  registration  in  which \n23 \ncanvassers assist applicants with completing and submitting forms is far more effective in \n24 \ngetting people registered to vote and prepared to participate in elections than simply giving \n25 \nout voter registration forms and relying on individuals to submit them themselves. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n39 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 42 of 68\n75.  This reduction is all the more harmful in communities with a substantial \n1 \n2  number of individuals who lack Arizona driver’s licenses and state IDs and, therefore, must \n3 \nsupply a physical photocopy of DPOR. In conducting its voter registration drives, Poder \n4 \nLatinx often encounters voter registration applicants who do not have an Arizona driver’s \n5 \nlicense or state identification number and therefore will not have a readily accessible means \n6 \n7  to fulfill the DPOR requirement. Some of these registration applicants Plaintiff encounters \n8 \ndo not have ready access to their DPOR, and other applicants do not possess any DPOR \n9 \nwhatsoever. \n10 \n76.  All of the above will thwart and impede Poder Latinx’s voter registration and \n11 \n12  civic engagement goals and harm its core mission. \n13 \n77.  All of the Challenged Provisions will impact naturalized citizens who are part \n14 \nof the community and constituency Poder Latinx serves through its voter education and voter \n15 \nmobilization programs.  Poder Latinx works closely with naturalized citizens to help them \n16 \n17  register to vote and to mobilize them to vote, relying in part on a network of key community \n18 \nactivists who help shape Poder Latinx’s agenda and who play a critical role in implementing \n19 \nPoder Latinx’s programs. Thus, all of the Challenged Provisions will impact and harm Poder \n20 \nLatinx’s constituents. \n21 \n22  78.  CPLC20  will  suffer  direct  and  immediate  injuries  if  the  Citizenship \n23 \nInvestigation Provisions in HB 2492 and HB 2243 are permitted to go into effect. CPLC has \n24 \nmade significant investments in its Get Out The Vote campaign for Latinos in Arizona. It \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n27  20 This First Amended Complaint has defined “CPLC” to include both Chicanos Por La \nCausa, Inc. and Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund. \n28 \n40 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 43 of 68\nhas invested $10 million to date in this voter registration and mobilization effort, which has \n1 \n2  been branded as Latino Loud. To engage and activate eligible Latino voters throughout \n3 \nArizona, the Latino Loud campaign uses a variety of methods: voter registration, canvassing, \n4 \nmailers, billboard ads, digital ads, radio and TV ads, and special events. It has a particular \n5 \nfocus on low-propensity Latino voters, who are typically harder to contact and harder to turn \n6 \n7  out to the polls. Mobilizing low-propensity voters demands more resources, staff and \n8 \nvolunteer time, and money than mobilizing high-propensity voters. \n9 \n79.  CPLC funds third-party groups to conduct voter registration in Maricopa, \n10 \nPima, and Yuma counties. These canvassers and voter registration drive staff members for \n11 \n12  the Latino Loud campaign exclusively use the Arizona voter registration form. They also \n13 \nuse a specialized URL provided to CPLC by the Arizona Secretary of State’s office to \n14 \nregister voters online. The canvassers are making approximately 800,000 attempted contacts \n15 \nat Latino households, targeting Latino-heavy legislative districts within Maricopa, Pima, and \n16 \n17  Yuma counties. Canvassers inform eligible voters about the importance of voting and, if \n18 \nthere are eligible but unregistered members of the household, the canvasser will proceed to \n19 \nregister them to vote. That process of course takes time and effort to walk the individual \n20 \nthrough the voter registration form. Canvassers are paid by the hour. The Latino Loud \n21 \n22  campaign also conducts site-specific voter registration drives periodically in Maricopa, \n23 \nPima, and Yuma counties. Additionally, all of the Latino Loud campaign ads, direct mail, \n24 \nwebsites, and social media accounts are part of a comprehensive statewide campaign to \n25 \nregister eligible Latino voters and to provide links to do so online. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n41 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 44 of 68\n80.  The Citizenship Investigation Provisions in HB 2492 and HB 2243 will cause \n1 \n2  the unlawful denial of voter registration applications and the unlawful removal of duly \n3 \nregistered,  eligible  voters  from  the  rolls.  By  forcing  the  CPLC-financed  Latino  Loud \n4 \ncampaign to register and re-register eligible Arizona voters who are unlawfully denied \n5 \nregistration or unlawfully removed from the rolls because of the Citizenship Investigation \n6 \n7  Provisions, this wastes CPLC’s money, causing a direct financial injury. But for these \n8 \nChallenged Provisions which violate federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution, CPLC would \n9 \nnot be forced to divert or waste money and other resources to counteract or correct the \n10 \nunlawful denial of registration and unlawful voter purging caused by HB 2492 and HB 2243.   \n11 \n12  81.  In addition to the diversion or waste of money and resources caused by these \n13 \ntwo new laws, CPLC will also suffer reputational harm in the Latino communities in which \n14 \nthe Latino Loud campaign is active. Latino Loud is clearly branded as a CPLC campaign on \n15 \nvolunteer t-shirts, all materials used by canvassers, and all its campaign ads and billboards. \n16 \n17  Voters in these communities associate the Latino Loud campaign with CPLC because \n18 \nvolunteers wear CPLC-branded t-shirts, and all ads and materials display CPLC’s name. \n19 \nCPLC has a 53-year-old trusted brand in these marginalized communities, good will that has \n20 \nbeen hard-earned over decades. That trust will be damaged if the eligible voters registered \n21 \n22  through the CPLC-branded Latino Loud campaign are unlawfully denied registration or \n23 \nunlawfully  removed  from  the  voter  rolls.  Such  eligible  voters,  in  particular  the  low-\n24 \npropensity voters that the Latino Loud campaign is specifically targeting, will be more \n25 \ninclined to distrust CPLC, the Latino Loud campaign, the voter registration process, and the \n26 \nelectoral  process  as  a  whole,  if  they  are  unlawfully  denied  registration  or  unlawfully \n27 \n28 \n42 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 45 of 68\nremoved from the voter rolls. If these laws go into effect, CPLC foresees a loss of trust and \n1 \n2  a chilling effect on voter participation in the communities it serves. \n3 \n82.  In addition to the harm from the wasted and/or diverted financial investment \n4 \nand resources expended on the Latino Loud campaign’s voter registration and re-registration \n5 \nof unlawfully denied or unlawfully removed voters, CPLC will also be injured by HB 2492 \n6 \n7  and  HB  2243’s  enforcement  because  its  immigration  division  works  continuously  on \n8 \nregistering recently naturalized U.S. citizens. If those individuals attempt to register to vote \n9 \nthrough other means and then are unlawfully denied registration or unlawfully removed from \n10 \nthe rolls because of HB 2492 and HB 2243, CPLC’s immigration team that works with \n11 \n12  recently naturalized U.S. citizens will unnecessarily divert or waste time, resources, money, \n13 \nand effort registering those individuals, when that time, money, and effort could have been \n14 \nexpended advancing other components of CPLC’s core mission.  \n15 \n83.  CPLC does this voter registration work using its own funds but also has a \n16 \n17  recent grant from UnidosUS to conduct outreach to newly naturalized citizens to make sure \n18 \nthose individual clients are registered to vote. Over the pandemic, CPLC worked with an \n19 \naverage of approximately 200 naturalization applicants per year, but it expects that annual \n20 \nnumber to increase to between 300 and 400 naturalization applicants in the coming years. \n21 \n22  CPLC’s mission is focused on making a continual effort to ensure these newly naturalized \n23 \ncitizens with whom it works are registered to vote. CPLC continues to try to ascertain how \n24 \nmany of its successfully naturalized clients remain unregistered to vote and then will work \n25 \nto register those eligible, unregistered individuals on an ongoing basis. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n43 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 46 of 68\n84.  CPLC staff working with naturalization applicants and recently naturalized \n1 \n2  citizens operate out of its Yuma County office, which serves Nogales as well, and its Pima \n3 \nCounty office. CPLC intends to open a Phoenix office in the near future. \n4 \n85.  The Citizenship Investigation Provisions will impact naturalized citizens who \n5 \nare part of the community and constituency CPLC serves through its voter education and \n6 \n7  mobilization campaign.  CPLC works closely with naturalized citizens to help them register \n8 \nto vote and to mobilize them to vote. Thus, all of the Citizenship Investigation Provisions \n9 \nwill impact and harm CPLC’s constituents. \n10 \nCLAIMS \n11 \n12  COUNT ONE  \n(All Plaintiffs) \n13 \n(Violation of Section 8(b) of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), 52 U.S.C. § \n20507(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n14 \nHB 2492 Secs. 4, 7, and 8 (Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-121.01(D), 16-121.01(E), and 16-\n15  121.01(F); Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-143; Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(A)(10))21 \n \n16 \n86.  The factual allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 85 are incorporated \n17 \ninto Count One, as though fully set forth herein. \n18 \n87.  Section 8(b) of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b), mandates that “[a]ny State \n19 \n20  program  or  activity  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  electoral  process  by  ensuring  the \n21 \nmaintenance of an accurate and current voter registration roll for elections for Federal office \n22 \n. . . be uniform [and] nondiscriminatory.” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b)(1). \n23 \n24 \n                                              \n25  21 Plaintiffs have submitted a second NVRA notice letter to Defendant Secretary of State \nHobbs, identifying NVRA violations, including another Section 8(b) violation, in HB 2243, \n26 \nwhich was enacted at the end of this legislative session. Based on an effective date of January \n27  for these provisions, these NVRA claims cannot be added to this complaint until late \nOctober. 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(2). \n28 \n44 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 47 of 68\n88.  A State law violates the uniformity requirement in this section when its voter \n1 \n2  registration processing has the effect of treating a group of voters differently, whether in \n3 \ntheir initial addition to the voter list or their removal from it. See Project Vote v. Blackwell, \n4 \n455 F. Supp. 2d 694, 703 (N.D. Ohio 2006). Similarly, a state voter registration law violates \n5 \nthe nondiscrimination requirement where the voter registration process discriminates against \n6 \n7  particular classes of voters. See id.  \n8 \n89.  The system HB 2492 creates does not comply with the uniformity requirement \n9 \nunder Section 8(b) as it will cause the arbitrary and disparate treatment of naturalized voter \n10 \nregistration applicants and naturalized registered voters, including Latinx voter registration \n11 \n12  applicants and Latinx registered voters. The means and standards by which voters are added \n13 \nto  the  rolls  and/or  removed  will  depend  on  the  voter’s  county.  Further,  because  the \n14 \nchallenged provisions of HB 2492 will inevitably treat voters in a differential manner based \n15 \non the county they live in and based on their race, ethnicity, and/or national origin—in part, \n16 \n17  by targeting naturalized citizens for registration denial and removal from the rolls—these \n18 \nprovisions also violate the NVRA’s nondiscrimination requirement. \n19 \n90.  Combined with a vague standard for county recorders to apply— “information \n20 \nthat  [the  individual]  is  not  a United States  citizen”—this  is  a  recipe  for  non-uniform \n21 \n22  treatment and the disenfranchisement of eligible persons from registering to vote or staying \n23 \non the rolls. The Citizen Investigation Provisions are bereft of any rules or criteria to apply \n24 \nin deciding who is and who is not a U.S. citizen. Whereas the preexisting DPOC requirement \n25 \ncontains an objective list of the specific forms of documentation that prove a registration \n26 \napplicant’s U.S. citizenship, Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-166(F), the Citizenship Investigation \n27 \n28 \n45 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 48 of 68\nProvisions in HB 2492 do not articulate what “information” will prove that a registration \n1 \n2  applicant or registered voter “is not a United States citizen.” Nor does it address ensuring \n3 \nthat such information is accurately connected to a voter record. \n4 \n91.  Because no database of any kind would indicate a native-born voter previously \n5 \nlacked U.S. citizenship, naturalized citizens are subject to differential treatment under the \n6 \n7  Citizen Investigation Provisions in HB 2492. This is exacerbated by the statute’s command \n8 \nthat county recorders rely on “every . . . available” database to verify U.S. citizenship status, \n9 \nsuggesting that some may be “available” to some officials and not others, making uniformity \n10 \nunlikely. Further, the Citizenship Investigation Provisions also permit county recorders to \n11 \n12  credit uncorroborated “information” supplied by private individuals either in writing or \n13 \nverbally. Information from private individuals in different counties would raises a high \n14 \nlikelihood of lacking uniformity. The laws provide no safeguards or guidance to help assure \n15 \ncounty recorders that the individual of allegedly questionable citizenship status is in fact the \n16 \n17  same person as the individual on the voter roll. Without such safeguards, implementation \n18 \nwill be inherently not be uniform within counties or across the state. Further, it credits stale \n19 \n“information” over the more recent attestation of the applicant.  \n20 \n92.  In particular, the Citizenship Investigation Provisions fail to inform Arizona \n21 \n22  state and local officials as to how they should review and evaluate outdated citizenship status \n23 \ninformation contained in government databases. Different county recorders and different \n24 \nstaff  members  within  a  county  recorder’s  office  will  inevitably  apply  varying  rules, \n25 \nstandards, and procedures in comparing voter registration applicants and registered voters \n26 \nto the enumerated databases in HB 2492 and in analyzing the search results. Ascertaining \n27 \n28 \n46 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 49 of 68\nwhat information suffices to determine a voter registration applicant or registered voter is \n1 \n2  not a U.S. citizen will be left to the subjective analysis, discretion, and guesswork of the \n3 \nSecretary of State, county recorders, the Attorney General, and their staffs. Inevitably, they \n4 \nwill make inconsistent and irreconcilable determinations as to voters’ current citizenship \n5 \nstatus. Some county recorders and individual staff members will use stale government data \n6 \n7  showing an individual was not a U.S. citizen at some time in the past as evidence they are \n8 \nstill non-citizens; others will keep digging and find that similarly situated voters naturalized \n9 \nprior to registering to vote. \n10 \n93.  The Citizenship Investigation Provisions require county recorders to cancel \n11 \n12  the voter registration records of individuals when they “receive[ ] and confirm[ ] information \n13 \nthat the person registered is not a United States citizen.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(A)(10), \n14 \nas enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 8. \n15 \n94.  Defendant Hobbs was notified of these violations of Section 8(b) of the NVRA \n16 \n17  on June 3, 2022. See Exhibit A, NVRA Notice Letter regarding HB 2492. As HB 2492 is \n18 \nstill set to go into effect on January 1, 2023, these violations have not been corrected. \n19 \n95.  The Citizenship  Investigation  Provisions  contained  in  HB 2492  are  non-\n20 \nuniform and discriminatory with respect to naturalized citizens in violation of Section 8(b), \n21 \n22  52 U.S.C. § 20507(b).  \n23 \n96.  The Citizenship Investigation Provisions contained in HB 2492 will also result \n24 \nin discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and/or national origin in violation of Section 8(b), \n25 \n52 U.S.C. § 20507(b). These discriminatory effects will fall on Latinx voter registration \n26 \napplicants and Latinx registered voters.  \n27 \n28 \n47 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 50 of 68\n97.  At all relevant times, Defendants have acted under color of state law.  \n1 \n2  98.  Accordingly, the Citizenship Investigation Provisions in HB 2492, specifically \n3 \nAriz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-121.01(D), 16-121.01(E), and 16-121.01(F), Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-\n4 \n143, and Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(A)(10), violate Section 8(b) of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. § \n5 \n20507(b). \n6 \n7  COUNT TWO \n(All Plaintiffs) \n8  (Discriminatory Practices and Procedures for Voter Qualification Determinations, 52 \nU.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n9  HB 2243 Section 2 (Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H)) \n \n10 \n99.  The factual allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 98 are incorporated \n11 \ninto Count Two, as though fully set forth herein. \n12 \n100.  Title I of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which was enacted specifically to combat \n13 \n14  discriminatory and arbitrary registration practices in the Jim Crow South, provides that \n15 \nNo person acting under color of law shall-- (A) in determining whether any \nindividual is qualified under State law or laws to vote in any election, apply \n16 \nany standard, practice, or procedure different from the standards, practices, or \n17  procedures applied under such law or laws to other individuals within the same \ncounty, parish, or similar political subdivision who have been found by State \n18 \nofficials to be qualified to vote[.] \n19   \n52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A). \n20 \n101.  HB 2243 will require county recorders each month to use the notoriously \n21 \n22  outdated and unreliable Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (“SAVE”) Program \n23 \nmaintained  by  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  (“USCIS”)  “to  verify  the \n24 \ncitizenship status” of any “persons who are registered to vote in that county and who the \n25 \ncounty recorder has reason to believe are not United States citizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-\n26 \n27  165(H), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 370 § 2 (emphasis added). The county \n28 \n48 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 51 of 68\nrecorders will then remove those registered Arizona voters whose citizenship status cannot \n1 \n2  be verified or even those voters for whom there is information they previously lacked U.S. \n3 \ncitizenship.  \n4 \n102.  This  discriminatory  use  of  the  notoriously  unreliable  SAVE  system  in  a \n5 \npurported attempt to verify the citizenship status of individual voter registration applicants \n6 \n7  whom the county recorders have “reason to believe are not United States citizens” violates \n8 \n52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A). This federal statute prohibits county recorders from “apply[ing] \n9 \nany standard, practice, or procedure different from the standards, practices, or procedures \n10 \napplied under such law or laws to other individuals within the same county . . . who have \n11 \n12  been found by State officials to be qualified to vote[.]” Id. And that is exactly what Section \n13 \n16-165(H) requires county recorders to do whenever they have “reason to believe” a \n14 \nregistered voter is not a U.S. citizen. \n15 \n103.  Under the boundless authority granted by Section 16-165(H), county recorders \n16 \n17  divide registered voters into two camps—those they suspect are non-citizens and those they \n18 \ndo not. County recorders then are instructed to apply a different “standard, practice, or \n19 \nprocedure”, see  52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A), for verifying the eligibility of voters in the \n20 \nformer camp and ultimately to remove a voter from the rolls if a flawed database returns \n21 \n22  “information . . . that the person registered is not a United States citizen.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § \n23 \n16-165(A)(10), modified 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 370, § 2. \n24 \n104.  Other registered voters within any county who are not suspected of lacking \n25 \nU.S.  citizenship  will  never  be  subjected  to  this  faulty  SAVE  system  comparison  to \n26 \n“determin[e] whether [they are] qualified under State law or laws to vote in any election” \n27 \n28 \n49 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 52 of 68\n(52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A)); nor will they face cancellation of their registration as a result \n1 \n2  of this discriminatory citizenship investigation. \n3 \n105.  Upon information and belief, SAVE cannot be queried for a natural-born \n4 \ncitizen.  \n5 \n106.  At all relevant times, Defendants have acted under color of state law.  \n6 \n7  107.  Accordingly, Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H) violates Title I of the 1964 Civil \n8 \nRights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A). \n9 \nCOUNT THREE \n10  (All Plaintiffs) \n(Racial and National Origin Discrimination, Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth \n11 \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and Fifteenth Amendment, and 42 U.S.C. § \n12  1983) \nHB 2243 Section 2 (Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H)) \n13 \n \n108.  The factual allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 107 are incorporated \n14 \n15  into Count Three, as though fully set forth herein. \n16 \n109.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause prohibits racial and \n17 \nnational  origin  discrimination.  Davis  v.  Schnell,  81  F.  Supp.  872,  878  (S.D.  Ala. \n18 \n1949), aff’d 336  U.S.  933  (1949)  (holding  that  local  registrars’  “arbitrary  power”  and \n19 \n20  “unlimited discretion” in determining whether applicants seeking to register to vote could \n21 \n“understand and explain” any article of the U.S. Constitution amounted to a denial of equal \n22 \nprotection of the law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment); Hernandez v. State \n23 \nof Tex., 347 U.S. 475, 479 (1954) (discrimination on basis of national origin violates \n24 \n25  Fourteenth Amendment). \n26 \n110.  The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination concerning “the \n27 \nright of citizens of the United States to vote.” U.S. Const. amend. XV.  \n28 \n50 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 53 of 68\n111.  In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Louisiana’s constitutional \n1 \n2  understanding  test  for  the  arbitrary  power  it  gave  registrars,  thereby  enabling  racial \n3 \ndiscrimination in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court explained that: \n4 \nThe applicant facing a registrar in Louisiana thus has been compelled to leave \n5  his voting fate to that official's uncontrolled power to determine whether the \napplicant’s understanding of the Federal or State Constitution is satisfactory. . \n6 \n. The cherished right of people in a country like ours to vote cannot be \n7  obliterated by the use of laws like this, which leave the voting fate of a citizen \nto the passing whim or impulse of an individual registrar. Many of our cases \n8 \nhave pointed out the invalidity of laws so completely devoid of standards and \nrestraints. . . We likewise affirm here the District Court’s holding that the \n9 \nprovisions of the Louisiana Constitution and statutes which require voters to \n10  satisfy  registrars  of  their  ability  to  ‘understand  and  give  a  reasonable \ninterpretation of any section’ of the Federal or Louisiana Constitution violate \n11 \nthe Constitution. And we agree with the District Court that it specifically \n12  conflicts with the prohibitions against discrimination in voting because of race \nfound both in the Fifteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. s 1971(a) to subject \n13 \ncitizens to such an arbitrary power as Louisiana has given its registrars under \nthese laws. \n14 \n \n15  Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 152–53 (1965) (citations omitted). \n16 \n112.  Once it takes effect, each month, HB 2243 will require county recorders to use \n17 \nthe notoriously outdated and unreliable SAVE Program system maintained by USCIS “to \n18 \nverify the citizenship status” of any “persons who are registered to vote in that county and \n19 \n20  who the county recorder has reason to believe are not United States citizens.” Ariz. Rev. \n21 \nStat. § 16-165(H), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 370 § 2 (emphasis added). In \n22 \nthis way, HB 2243 vests local election officials in Arizona with “an arbitrary power” akin \n23 \nto that struck down in Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. at 153. \n24 \n25  113.  HB 2243 requires county recorders to use SAVE “to verify the citizenship \n26 \nstatus” of any “persons who are registered to vote in that county and who the county recorder \n27 \n28 \n51 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 54 of 68\nhas reason to believe are not United States citizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H), as enacted \n1 \n2  by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 370 § 2. \n3 \n114.  This new provision openly invites and licenses the discriminatory treatment of \n4 \nvoters on the basis of their actual or perceived race, national origin, English proficiency, \n5 \ndress,  and/or  any  other  personal  characteristic  which  a  county  recorder  or  their  staff \n6 \n7  subjectively perceives to be indicative of a lack of U.S. citizenship.  \n8 \n115.  HB 2243 could have explicitly provided that such characteristics are not \n9 \n“reason[s] to believe” voters “are not United States citizens,” but it does not. HB 2243 could \n10 \nhave explicitly forbidden local election officials from crediting unsworn third-party verbal \n11 \n12  accusations  or  written  reports  as  “reason[s]  to  believe”  voters  “are  not  United  States \n13 \ncitizens,” but it does not. Those legislative omissions send a clear message to county election \n14 \nofficials that they may act on the basis of prejudice and suspicion and need not wait for facts \n15 \nor evidence of non-citizenship. \n16 \n17  116.  The  inexorable  impact  of  this  deliberately  open-ended  and  official \n18 \nauthorization for local election officials to act on mere suspicion of lack of U.S. citizenship \n19 \nwill be the arbitrary, discriminatory treatment of voters on the basis of their race and national \n20 \norigin. \n21 \n22  117.  Section 16-165(H) violates U.S. Supreme Court precedents that struck down \n23 \narbitrary and discriminatory Jim Crow tests and devices. These discriminatory laws and \n24 \npractices enabled registrars to act on their prejudices and use their discretion in subjecting \n25 \nAfrican American voters to extra scrutiny that most often resulted in the rejection of a Black \n26 \napplicant’s  registration.  Section  16-165(H)  is,  in  essence,  a  redeployment  of  such \n27 \n28 \n52 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 55 of 68\nunconstitutional registration practices involving the unfettered discretion of officials to \n1 \n2  revoke voting rights and arbitrarily allocate the right to vote, with particular harm falling on \n3 \nnaturalized voters and, in particular, Latinx voters throughout Arizona. \n4 \n118.  At all relevant times, Defendants have acted under color of state law. \n5 \n119.  Defendants have violated and will continue to violate the Equal Protection \n6 \n7  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n8 \nCOUNT FOUR \n(All Plaintiffs) \n9 \n(Arbitrary and Disparate Treatment of Voter Registration Applicants Using the \nFederal Form and Currently Registered Voters, Equal Protection Clause of \n10 \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \nThe Citizenship Investigation Provisions (Both HB 2492 and HB 2243) \n11 \n \n12  120.  The factual allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 119 are incorporated \n13 \ninto Count Four, as though fully set forth herein. \n14 \n121.  The U.S. Supreme Court has long forbidden arbitrary allocation of the right to \n15 \nvote and arbitrary registration practices. Supreme Court precedent prohibits “arbitrary and \n16 \n17  disparate treatment” in either the “allocation of the franchise” or “the manner of its exercise.” \n18 \nBush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000); id. at 104–09 (concluding that “absence of specific \n19 \nstandards” to implement vague “intent of the voter” standard caused “arbitrary and disparate \n20 \ntreatment” in manual recount in violation of the Equal Protection Clause); see also Hunter \n21 \n22  v. Hamilton Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 635 F.3d 219, 235, 239–42 (6th Cir. 2011) (applying \n23 \nBush v. Gore to conclude “lack of specific standards for reviewing provisional ballots” had \n24 \nresulted in unconstitutionally “arbitrary and uneven exercise of discretion”). \n25 \n122.  Arbitrarily allocating the right to vote has long been held unconstitutional.  See \n26 \n27  Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. at 150–53 (“The cherished right of people in a country \n28 \n53 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 56 of 68\nlike ours to vote cannot be obliterated by the use of laws like this, which leave the voting \n1 \n2  fate of a citizen to the passing whim or impulse of an individual registrar.”). Indeed, any \n3 \n“arbitrary impairment” of the right to vote violates equal protection. Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. \n4 \n186, 208 (1962) (“A citizen’s right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has \n5 \nbeen judicially recognized as a right secured by the Constitution . . .”). \n6 \n7  123.  Arizona’s previously enacted DPOC law enumerates the specific forms of \n8 \nproof that a voter registration applicant can provide to establish U.S. citizenship. Ariz. Rev. \n9 \nStat. § 16-166(F). HB 2492, by contrast, does not enumerate what specific “information” \n10 \nproves that a voter registration applicant using the federal form or a registered voter “is not \n11 \n12  a U.S. citizen.” See Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-121.01(D) & (E).  The latter contains only a vague \n13 \ninstruction that leaves the registration applicant or registered voter’s citizenship status to the \n14 \ndiscretion  and  subjective,  arbitrary  determinations  of  Defendant  Hobbs,  Defendant \n15 \nBrnovich, and county recorder offices’ staff. \n16 \n17  124.  On the front end of the voter registration process, county recorders who \n18 \nreceive a federal registration form that is not accompanied by DPOC must attempt to “verify \n19 \nthe  citizenship  status  of  the  applicant”  and  must  compare  the  registration  applicant’s \n20 \ninformation to every federal, state, and local government database and every “other database \n21 \n22  relating to voter registration” to which the county recorder has access. \n23 \n125.  HB 2492 specifies that  \n24 \n[i]f the county recorder or other officer in charge of elections matches the \n25  [federal form] applicant with information that the applicant is not a United \nStates citizen, the county recorder or other officer in charge of elections shall \n26 \nreject the application, notify the applicant that the application was rejected \nbecause the applicant is not a United States citizen and forward the application \n27 \n28 \n54 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 57 of 68\nto  the  county  attorney  and  Attorney  General  for  investigation.  \n1 \n \n2  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-121.01(E), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4. What \n3 \nconstitutes “information that the applicant is not a United States citizen” is left unspecified \n4 \nand for the discretion and subjective, arbitrary determinations of Arizona’s 15 county \n5 \nrecorders’ offices and their staff members. How county recorders and their staff must \n6 \n7  evaluate and interpret stale information that a person lacked U.S. citizenship at some time \n8 \nin the past, during for instance a government transaction for driver licensing or public \n9 \nassistance, is also left unspecified. The flagged individual’s likely naturalization as a U.S. \n10 \ncitizen subsequent to that outdated government transaction record but prior to registering as \n11 \n12  an Arizona voter is left unaddressed. The legal void created by these vague instructions will \n13 \nbe filled with the judgment calls and discretion of county recorders and their staff who will \n14 \ninevitably  make  inconsistent  and  irreconcilable  determinations  on  voter  registration \n15 \napplicants’  citizenship  status.  Such  arbitrary  and  disparate  treatment  concerning  the \n16 \n17  allocation of the right to vote is HB 2492’s inevitable consequence. \n18 \n126.  A similar process is required on the back end of the voter registration process. \n19 \nFor  registered  Arizona  voters  who  have  not  provided  DPOC  and  can  only  vote  in \n20 \ncongressional elections, HB 2492 requires Defendant Brnovich to engage in the same wide-\n21 \n22  ranging  database  review  to  identify  voters  who  are  purportedly  not  U.S.  citizens  and \n23 \n“prosecute individuals who are found to not be United States citizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § \n24 \n16-143, as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 7. \n25 \n127.  HB 2243 requires the removal of voters from the statewide voter registration \n26 \ndatabase “[w]hen the county recorder obtains information pursuant to this section and \n27 \n28 \n55 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 58 of 68\nconfirms that the person registered is not a United States citizen.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-\n1 \n2  165(A)(10), as enacted by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 370, § 2. Once again, HB 2243 does \n3 \nnot specify what type, set, or combination of “information” establishes that a registered voter \n4 \n“is not a United States citizen” currently; nor do these provisions acknowledge, let alone \n5 \naddress, these flagged registered voters’ likely naturalization subsequent to the government \n6 \n7  record’s creation but before their registration as a voter.  Nor does the statute specify what \n8 \nit means to “confirm” a person is not a U.S. citizen. These vague instructions will inevitably \n9 \nlead to arbitrary and disparate treatment of registered voters and arbitrary allocation of the \n10 \nright to vote. HB 2243 therefore authorizes county recorders and their staff to rely on \n11 \n12  outdated government data or unverified, unsubstantiated statements regarding a registered \n13 \nvoter’s citizenship status to remove that voter from the rolls. Even if not all county recorders, \n14 \nand not all staff members rely on such unreliable information, the result will be the arbitrary \n15 \nand disparate treatment of naturalized registered Arizona voters. \n16 \n17  128.  There is no database that has current, up-to-date citizenship status information \n18 \nfor all residents of the United States or Arizona. All databases that contain citizenship status \n19 \ninformation are based on transactions or events that took place at some point in the past. \n20 \nRelying on stale, old government data as if it were evidence of a registration applicant’s or \n21 \n22  registered voter’s present-day citizenship status is illogical and irrational and will inevitably \n23 \nlead to arbitrary and disparate treatment and arbitrary allocation of the right to vote. \n24 \n129.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-165(H) especially gives county recorders unlimited \n25 \ndiscretion  to  subject  registered  voters  to  subject  registered  U.S.  citizens  to  extra, \n26 \nunwarranted investigation and potentially registration cancellation when they merely have \n27 \n28 \n56 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 59 of 68\n“reason to believe [certain voters] are not United States citizens.” This will inevitably lead \n1 \n2  to arbitrary and inconsistent treatment of voters statewide and within counties. \n3 \n130.  HB 2492 and HB 2243’s Citizenship Investigation Provisions, including the \n4 \nregistration cancellation provision, subject naturalized voter registration applicants and \n5 \nnaturalized  registered  voters  to  arbitrary  and  disparate  treatment  within  counties  and \n6 \n7  statewide, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  \n8 \n131.  At all relevant times, Defendants have acted under color of state law. \n9 \n132.  Defendants have violated and will continue to violate the Equal Protection \n10 \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n11 \nCOUNT FIVE \n12 \n(All Plaintiffs) \n(Violation of Procedural Due Process as to Voter Registration Applicants Using the \n13 \nFederal Voter Registration Form Who Do Not Provide Documentary Proof of \nCitizenship, Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n14 \nHB 2492 Section 5 (Ariz.

NMFS, 161 F.3d \n15 \n584, 588 (9th Cir. 1998); Ching v. Mayorkas, 725 F.3d 1149, 1155 (9th Cir. 2013) (“[A] \n16 \n17  benefit is not a protected entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their \n18 \ndiscretion.” (quotation omitted)). The same is true with respect to the creation of a liberty \n19 \ninterest.  See  Mendoza  v.  Blodgett,  960  F.2d  1425,  1428–29  (9th  Cir.  1992)  (“A \n20 \nstate creates a protected liberty interest when it places substantive limitations on official \n21 \n22  discretion.  .  .  .  The  regulations  also  must  contain  ‘explicitly  mandatory \n23 \nlanguage,’ i.e., specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulations’ substantive \n24 \npredicates are present, a particular outcome must follow, in order to create a liberty interest.” \n25 \n(quoting Kentucky. Dep’t of Corr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 463 (1989))). \n26 \n27 \n28 \n58 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 61 of 68\n137.  Under the U.S. Constitution, the right to vote is “precious” and “fundamental.” \n1 \n2  Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966).  The right to vote is “of \n3 \nthe most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.”  Burdick v. Takushi, \n4 \n504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (quoting Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 \n5 \nU.S. 173, 184 (1979)).  “The right to vote freely for the candidate of one’s choice is of the \n6 \n7  essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of a \n8 \nrepresentative government.”  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964).  Accordingly, \n9 \nprocedural due process protections apply to the right to vote as a constitutionally protected \n10 \nliberty interest.  \n11 \n12  138.  Arizona law creates a protectible interest in voter registration by guaranteeing \n13 \nthe right to register to every U.S. citizen who is at least 18 years old, who has been a resident \n14 \nof the state for at least 29 days before Election Day, who has not been convicted of a \n15 \ndisqualifying felony, and who timely registers to vote in accordance with the rules and \n16 \n17  procedures established under state law and regulations. Ariz. Const. § 2(A); see Ariz. Rev. \n18 \nStat. §§ 16-101, 16-121. It does not give the county recorders discretion to deny the \n19 \napplications of individuals who satisfy these criteria, rules, and procedures. See Ariz. Rev. \n20 \nStat. § 16-163(A) (“The county recorder, on receipt of a registration in proper form, shall \n21 \n22  assign the registration record to its proper precinct and alphabetical arrangement in the \n23 \ngeneral county register.” (emphasis added)). \n24 \n139.  HB 2492 amended Arizona’s voter qualification statutes such that a registrant \n25 \nmust “provide[ ] satisfactory evidence of citizenship” to qualify to register. Ariz. Rev. Stat. \n26 \n§§ 16-101(A)(1), 16-121(A), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 99, §§ 1, 3. However, \n27 \n28 \n59 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 62 of 68\neven if a federal form applicant does not submit DPOC, the requirement is fully satisfied if \n1 \n2  county recorders’ staff can independently verify a federal form applicant’s U.S. citizenship. \n3 \nId. § 16-121.01(D), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99, § 4. \n4 \n140.  When a governing statute is sufficiently mandatory to grant an applicant a \n5 \nvested interest in an entitlement or benefit, applicants “who claim to meet the eligibility \n6 \n7  requirements” have a right to due process in the evaluation of their applications, including \n8 \nin the methods used to assess their eligibility. Griffeth v. Detrich, 603 F.2d 118, 121 (9th \n9 \nCir. 1979); Holohan v. Massanari, 246 F.3d 1195, 1209 (9th Cir. 2001) (recognizing that \n10 \n“applicants  for  social  security  disability  benefits  are  entitled  to  due  process  in  the \n11 \n12  determination of their claims” because they have property interest in benefits); Stivers v. \n13 \nPierce, 71 F.3d 732, 740–41 (9th Cir. 1995) (“It is well-settled that the Due Process Clause \n14 \nprevents the state from depriving a plaintiff of a protected property interest without ‘a fair \n15 \ntrial in a fair tribunal.’ . . . This requirement applies not only to courts, but also to state \n16 \n17  administrative agencies charged with applying eligibility criteria for licenses.” (internal \n18 \ncitation omitted)); see also Ressler v. Pierce, 692 F.2d 1212, 1216 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding \n19 \nthat plaintiff “should have been given some means of ensuring that her application for \n20 \nSection 8 benefits was received and given meaningful review”). Federal form applicants \n21 \n22  who submit their forms without DPOC therefore have a right to due process in how their \n23 \nU.S. citizenship is investigated or assessed in the course of decisions as to whether they are \n24 \npermitted to register to vote. \n25 \n141.  The Citizenship Investigation Provisions established by HB 2492, particularly \n26 \nthe vague standard “information that the applicant is not a United States citizen,” create a \n27 \n28 \n60 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 63 of 68\nhigh risk of erroneous deprivation, first, for the reasons described above in Count One and \n1 \n2  second, because accurately matching two or more sets of data across different databases, \n3 \nparticularly those not designed to interact, is a difficult enterprise. Jurisdictions that have \n4 \nattempted such matching schemes have struggled not only with stale data but also to ensure \n5 \nthat the person who is assertedly the voter found on a database is in fact the individual on \n6 \n7  the voter list and not another individual who shares some personal information with the \n8 \nvoter.  \n9 \n142.  While  notice  is  given  to  registration  applicants  who  are  “matched”  to \n10 \ninformation indicating they are not U.S. citizens, HB 2492 fails to give these individuals an \n11 \n12  opportunity to affirm their citizenship or even to submit DPOC prior to the rejection and \n13 \nreflexively refers the applicant to law enforcement for investigation. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-\n14 \n121.01(E), as amended by 2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 99 § 4 (“If the county recorder or other \n15 \nofficer in charge of elections matches the applicant with information that the applicant is not \n16 \n17  a United States citizen, the county recorder or other officer in charge of elections shall reject \n18 \nthe application, notify the applicant that the application was rejected because the applicant \n19 \nis not a United States citizen and forward the application to the county attorney and Attorney \n20 \nGeneral for investigation.”). \n21 \n22  143.  In order to be meaningful, the right to be heard must be afforded prior to the \n23 \ndeprivation. See Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (“If the right to notice and a \n24 \nhearing is to serve its full purpose, then it is clear that it must be granted at a time when the \n25 \ndeprivation can still be prevented . . . the Court has traditionally insisted that, whatever its \n26 \nform, opportunity for that hearing must be provided before the deprivation at issue takes \n27 \n28 \n61 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 64 of 68\neffect.”). HB 2492 fails to provide an opportunity to be heard prior to the denial of a \n1 \n2  registration application, and thus does not comport with requirements of procedural due \n3 \nprocess. \n4 \n144.  No government interest exists that outweighs the risk of disenfranchisement \n5 \nfaced by federal form applicants who are matched to non-citizenship information. \n6 \n7  145.  At all relevant times, Defendants have acted under color of state law. For the \n8 \nforegoing reasons, Defendants have violated and will continue to violate procedural due \n9 \nprocess, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. \n10 \n§ 1983. \n11 \n12  COUNT SIX \n(Poder Latinx) \n13  (Violation of NVRA Requirement That States Accept and Use Timely-Submitted \nFederal Registration Forms to Register Voters, 52 U.S.C. §§ 20505, 20507(a)) \n14  HB 2492 Section 5 (Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 16-123, 16-121.01(A)) \n \n15 \n146.  The factual allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 145 are incorporated \n16 \ninto Count Six, as though fully set forth herein.  \n17 \n147.  Section 6 of the NVRA requires covered States, including Arizona, to accept \n18 \n19  and use the federal voter registration form for registration to vote in elections for federal \n20 \noffice. 52 U.S.C. § 20505; Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (ITCA), 570 U.S. \n21 \n1 (2013). \n22 \n148.  The documentary proof of residence requirement in HB 2492 as applied to the \n23 \n24  federal voter registration form violates the NVRA under the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision \n25 \nin ITCA. \n26 \n149.  Specifically, the Supreme Court concluded that the NVRA prohibits states \n27 \nfrom applying different or additional requirements, such as the State of Arizona’s proof of \n28 \n62 \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 106   Filed 09/06/22   Page 65 of 68\ncitizenship requirement, to the federal voter registration form as promulgated by the Election \n1 \n2  Assistance Commission. ITCA, 570 U.S. at 20 (“We hold that [52 U.S.C. § 20505] precludes \n3 \nArizona from requiring a Federal Form applicant to submit information beyond that required \n4 \nby the form itself.”). \n5 \n150.  Because the federal form does not require documentary proof of residence, \n6 \n7  HB 2492’s attempt to require such proof of individuals registering to vote in elections for \n8 \nfederal office with the federal registration form violates the NVRA. \n9 \n151.  Defendant Hobbs was notified of this violation of Section 6 of the NVRA on \n10 \nJune 3, 2022. See Exhibit A. As HB 2492 is still set to go into effect on January 1, 2023, this \n11 \n12  violation has not been corrected. \n13 \n152.  At all relevant times, Defendants have acted under color of state law. \n14 \n153.  Defendants have violated and will continue to violate Sections 6 and 8 of the \n15 \nNVRA and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n16 \n17 \nI.

HB 2243 and HB 2492 (the “AZ Laws”) were passed as part of Arizona’s effort to \n4 \nimprove election integrity by ensuring voter qualifications are enforced and voter rolls are \n5 \n6  accurate.  HB 2492 updates voter qualifications and the state voter registration form.  First, it \n7 \nexpands  the  citizenship  qualification  by  adding  “satisfactory  evidence  of  citizenship  as \n8 \nprescribed in Section 16-166.”  A.R.S. § 16-101(A)(1).  Such evidence must be submitted \n9 \n10  with the state application for voter registration and includes “the applicants’ driver license or \n11 \nnonoperating  identification  license”  number;  “[a]  legible  photocopy”  of  either  a  birth \n12 \ncertificate or U.S. passport; “the applicant’s United States naturalization documents or the \n13 \nnumber of the certificate of naturalization;” or “[t]he applicant’s bureau of Indian affairs card \n14 \n15  number, tribal treaty card number or tribal enrollment number.”  A.R.S. §16-166(F).  An \n16 \napplicant  who  provides  satisfactory  proof  is  a  “qualified  elector”  and  will  have  their \n17 \nregistration processed by the appropriate state election official.  A.R.S. § 16-121 (defining \n18 \n19  qualified elector as “[a] person who is qualified to register to vote . . . and who is properly \n20 \nregistered to vote . . . is at least eighteen years of age on or before the date of the election and \n21 \nhas provided satisfactory evidence of citizenship”).   \n22 \nHB 2492 provides that proof of residence is also required, and can be satisfied by \n23 \n24 \nproviding a “valid form of identification that bears the photograph, name and address of the \n25 \nelector,” or “[t]wo different items that contain the name and address of the elector,” such as \n26 \n“a utility bill, a bank or credit union statement…, Arizona vehicle registration, an Arizona \n27 \n28 \n \n1 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 9 of 25\n \n1  vehicle insurance card, an Indian census card, tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal \n2 \nidentification.”  A.R.S. § 16-579(A)(1).   \n3 \nHB 2492 further provides that failure to include proof of citizenship on a state voter \n4 \nregistration form is grounds for the application to be rejected by the county recorder.  A.R.S. \n5 \n6  §16-121.01(C)  (“Except  for  a  form  produced  by  the  United  States  Election  Assistance \n7 \nCommission, . . . the . . . officer in charge of elections shall reject any application for \n8 \nregistration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of citizenship.”).  The procedure \n9 \n10  differs, however, for applicants who use a form produced by the U.S. Election Assistance \n11 \nCommission (“EAC”), commonly known as the Federal Form, because that procedure is \n12 \nsubject to the limitations of the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”).  The NVRA’s \n13 \nmandate that states “accept and use” the Federal Form precludes Arizona from requesting that \n14 \n15  applicants  submit  documentary  proof  of  citizenship  because  the  Federal  Form  does  not \n16 \nrequire it.  Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1 (2013) (hereinafter \n17 \n“ITAC”).  Election officials, however, are not barred from denying registration to those whose \n18 \n19  ineligibility is established based on information in the officials’ possession, id. at 15, and \n20 \nnothing in ITAC or the NVRA makes states presume the truth of any assertion an applicant \n21 \nmakes on the Federal Form, or bars states from verifying information provided on that form.  \n22 \nThus, unlike the pre-empted law in ITAC, HB 2492 does not order election officials to reject a \n23 \n24 \nFederal Form outright if it does not include documentary proof of citizenship.  Instead, if \n25 \nafter  “us[ing]  all  available  resources,”  a  Federal  Form  applicant’s  citizenship  status  is \n26 \nconfirmed, such applicant “shall be properly registered.”  A.R.S. § 16-121.01(E).  If the state \n27 \n28  official comes to possess “information that the applicant is not a United States citizen,” the \n \n2 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  Federal Form application must be rejected and the applicant notified that he or she was \n2 \nrejected because he or she was not a citizen.  Id.  Finally, if an election official “is unable to \n3 \nmatch the applicant with appropriate citizenship information,” the applicant will be notified \n4 \nthat his or her citizenship could not be verified and that he or she “will not be qualified to \n5 \n6  vote in a presidential election or by mail with an early ballot in any election until satisfactory \n7 \nevidence of citizenship is provided.”  Id.   \n8 \n  HB 2243 provides the requirements for the state registration form discussed by HB \n9 \n10  2492 and updates Arizona’s procedures for ensuring current and accurate voter rolls.  A.R.S. \n11 \n§ 16-165.  The provision enumerates the reasons why a voter’s registration may be cancelled, \n12 \nincluding but not limited to, “when the county recorder obtains information . . . and confirms \n13 \nthat the person registered is not a United States citizen[.]”  A.R.S. § 16-165(A)(10).  Before \n14 \n15  such person’s registration can be cancelled, the election official is required to provide written \n16 \nnotice stating “that the person’s registration will be canceled in thirty five days unless the \n17 \nperson provides satisfactory evidence of citizenship[.]”  Id.  The notice must “include a list of \n18 \n19  documents the person may provide” to establish his or her citizenship as well as “a postage \n20 \nprepaid  preaddressed  return  envelope.”    Id.    Registration  will  thus  only  be  cancelled \n21 \nfollowing written notice and an opportunity to establish eligibility.  Furthermore, once a \n22 \nregistration  is  cancelled,  written  notice  is  again  provided  to  the  person  explaining  the \n23 \n24 \ncancellation and including instructions on how to register to vote if and when the person is \n25 \nqualified.  A.R.S. § 16-165(K). \n26 \n \n27 \n28   \n \n3 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  ARGUMENT \n \n2 \nThe right to vote has long been recognized as a fundamental right of U.S. citizens.  \n3 \nSee, e.g., Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979) \n4 \n(“[V]oting  is  of  the  most  fundamental  significance  under  our  constitutional  structure”); \n5 \n6  Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964) (explaining that “[o]ther rights, even the most \n7 \nbasic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.”); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 \n8 \n(1886)  (describing  the  right  to  vote  as  “preservative  of  all  rights.”);  see  also  Foley  v. \n9 \n10  Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 296 (1978) (recognizing the “right[] of the people to be governed by \n11 \ntheir  citizen  peers”).    The  fundamental  nature  of  the  right  to  vote  requires  rules  and \n12 \nregulations to ensure fairness and faith in elections.  See Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 \n13 \n(1974)  (explaining  that  “as  a  practical  matter,  there  must  be  a  substantial  regulation  of \n14 \n15  elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to \n16 \naccompany the democratic processes.”); Buckley v. Am. Constitutional Law Found., 525 U.S. \n17 \n182, 206 (1999) (“States, of course, must regulate their elections to ensure that they are \n18 \n19  conducted in a fair and orderly fashion.”); Crawford v. Marion County Elec. Bd., 553 U.S. \n20 \n181, 189 (2008) (explaining that “public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process . . \n21 \n. encourages citizen participation in the democratic process.”).   \n22 \nThe  Constitution  vests  the  authority  to  set  voter  qualifications  and  rules  for  the \n23 \n24 \nconduct  of  elections  primarily  in  the  states.    Article  I  of  the  Constitution  contains  the \n25 \nguidelines for congressional elections, providing that “[t]he House of Representatives1 shall \n26 \n27                                                             \n1 The election of Senators is covered by the Seventeenth Amendment, which provides that \n28 \n“[t]he Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, elected \n \n4 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and \n2 \nthe Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most \n3 \nnumerous Branch of the State Legislature.”  U.S. Const. Art. I, § 2, cl. 1 (the “Qualifications \n4 \nClause”).  Article I also authorizes state legislatures to determine “[t]he times, places and \n5 \n6  manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.”  U.S. Const., Art. I, § 4.  \n7 \nUnlike voter qualifications, Times, Places and Manner authority is not solely reserved to the \n8 \nstates.  The Constitution grants Congress the authority to “make or alter such [state enacted] \n9 \n10  regulations.”  U.S. Const. art. 1, § 4, cl. 1 (the “Elections Clause”).  \n11 \nThe  authority  over  presidential  elections  is  also  primarily  delegated  to  the  states.  \n12 \nArticle II provides that the states “shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof \n13 \nmay  direct,  a  Number  of  Electors,  equal  to  the  whole  Number  of  Senators  and \n14 \n15  Representatives  to  which  the  State  may  be  entitled  in  Congress:  but  no  Senator  or \n16 \nRepresentative . . . shall be appointed an Elector.”  U.S. Const., Art. II, § 1, cl. 4 (the \n17 \n“Presidential Electors Clause”).  Unlike Congress’s “Time, Place and Manner” authority over \n18 \n19  congressional elections, the constitution only authorizes Congress to determine “the Time of \n20 \nchusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes.”  Id..  Congress \n21 \ntherefore  has  no  say  in  the  “manner”  or  “qualifications”  for  presidential  elections.    See \n22 \nOregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 210 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in \n23 \n24 \npart) (“It is difficult to see how words could be clearer in stating what Congress can control \n25 \n26 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n27  by the people thereof, . . . . The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for \nelectors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures.” \n28 \n \n \n5 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 13 of 25\n \n1  and what it cannot control.  Surely nothing in these provisions lends itself to the view that \n2 \nvoting qualifications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.”).   \n3 \nThus, while Congress’s authority under the Elections Clause to enact “Time, Place and \n4 \nManner” laws is broad, it has no authority to set voter qualifications.  See Husted v. A. Philip \n5 \n6  Randolph Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833, 1859 (2018) (explaining that Congress’s authority “over the \n7 \n‘Times, Places and Manner’ of congressional elections is paramount, and may be exercised at \n8 \nany time, and to any extent which it deems expedient; and so far as it is exercised . . . the \n9 \n10  regulations effected supersede” any conflicting state laws.).  See also ITAC, 570 U.S. at 16 \n11 \n(explaining that Congress has the constitutional authority “to regulate how federal elections \n12 \nare held, but not who may vote in them.”) (emphases in original). \n13 \nI.  THE  AZ  LAWS  DO  NOT  VIOLATE  THE  NATIONAL  VOTER \n14 \nREGISTRATION ACT. \n15   \n  Neither  ITAC  nor  the  NVRA  should  be  read  to  infringe  states’  constitutional \n16 \n17  authority over voter qualifications in federal elections, nor to bar states from performing their \n18 \nconstitutional duty to safeguard election integrity.  Nothing in these authorities makes states \n19 \npresume the truth of any assertion an applicant makes on the Federal Form, forbids states to \n20 \n21  verify  assertions  made  on  that  form,  compels  states  to  accept  assertions  that  cannot  be \n22 \nverified, or precludes states from establishing their own election procedures or purging their \n23 \nvoter rolls of ineligible voters. \n24 \nA. The AZ Laws do not conflict with the NVRA’s requirement that states \n25 \naccept and use the Federal Form. \n26   \nCongress enacted the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (“NVRA”), 52 U.S.C. § \n27 \n28  20501 et seq., based on its broad authority under the Elections Clause.  The NVRA was \n \n6 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 14 of 25\n \n1  passed to “increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote for Federal office,” \n2 \nand “protect the integrity of the electoral process.”  52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(3) (emphasis \n3 \nadded).  See also Husted, 138 S. Ct. at 1838 (“The Act has two main objectives: increasing \n4 \nvoter registration and removing ineligible persons from the States’ voter registration rolls.”).  \n5 \n6  The  NVRA  accomplishes  these  objectives  by  “requir[ing]  States  to  provide  simplified \n7 \nsystems for registering to vote in federal elections.”  ITAC, 570 U.S. at 6 (quoting Young v. \n8 \nFordice, 520 U.S. 273, 275 (1997)). \n9 \n10  A key part of this “simplified system” is the National Mail Registration Form, also \n11 \nknown as the “Federal Form.”  52 U.S.C. § 20505.  The NVRA requires that “[e]ach State \n12 \naccept  and  use  the”  Federal  Form  for  voter  registration.    52  U.S.C.  §  20505(a)(1).  \n13 \nAccordingly, “a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizenship not required by the \n14 \n15  Federal Form is inconsistent with the NVRA’s mandate that States ‘accept and use’ the \n16 \nFederal Form”.  ITAC, 570 U.S. at 15.  This requirement, however, “does not preclude States \n17 \nfrom  deny[ing]  registration  based  on  information  in  their  possession  establishing  the \n18 \n19  applicant’s ineligibility.  The NVRA clearly contemplates that not every submitted Federal \n20 \nForm will result in registration.”  Id. \n21 \nThe AZ Laws are in compliance with the NVRA and  ITAC because they do not \n22 \ninterfere with Arizona’s acceptance and use of the Federal Form.  First, Arizona does not \n23 \n24 \nrequire Federal Form  applicants  to submit evidence  of citizenship or residence with the \n25 \nFederal Form; such requirements are only applicable to the state registration form.  HB 2492 \n26 \nrequires  automatic  rejection  of  applications  submitted  without  evidence  of  citizenship, \n27 \n28  “[e]xcept for [applications submitted via] a form produced by the United States Election \n \n7 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 15 of 25\n \n1  Assistance Commission.”  A.R.S. § 16-121.01(C).  With respect to the Federal Form, election \n2 \nofficials are instructed to “use all available resources to verify the citizenship status of the \n3 \n[Federal Form] applicant.”  Id.  Such resources include but are not limited to databases for the \n4 \nDepartment  of  Transportation,  Social  Security  Administration,  and  the  United  States \n5 \n6  Citizenship and Immigration Service Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program.  \n7 \nId.  If citizenship cannot be verified based on this information, the election official must \n8 \nprovide  written notice that  “the applicant  will not be qualified  to vote in a presidential \n9 \n10  election  or  by  mail  with  an  early  ballot  in  any  election  until  satisfactory  evidence  of \n11 \ncitizenship is provided.”  A.R.S. § 16-121.01(E). \n12 \nThese verification procedures do not conflict with the mandate that states “accept and \n13 \nuse” the Federal Form.  If that mandate forbade states to verify assertions made on the \n14 \n15  Federal Form, it would require states to presume the truth of those assertions.  Any such \n16 \npresumption would be nonsensical, and trench on states’ powers to establish and maintain \n17 \nvoter qualifications. And no such presumption of truth is required by the “accept and use” \n18 \n19  mandate, since states retain the ability not to register applicants who are found ineligible \n20 \nbased on information not submitted with the Federal Form.  ITAC, 570 U.S. at 15.   \n21 \nAnd if states may verify assertions made on the form, and not register applicants \n22 \nwhose assertions are found false, the “accept and use” mandate also does not forbid states to \n23 \n24 \nact on their inability to verify an applicant’s assertions by not registering that applicant.  If \n25 \nstates had to register voters whose qualifications could not be verified, their constitutional \n26 \npowers over voter qualifications would be severely compromised. See ITAC, 570 U.S. at 16 \n27 \n28 \n \n8 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 16 of 25\n \n1  (explaining that states, not Congress, have the constitutional authority “to regulate . . . who \n2 \nmay vote in” federal elections) (emphasis in original). \n3 \nB. States  retain  the  power  to  create  and  use  their  own  mail-in  voter \n4  registration forms under the NVRA. \n \n5 \nAs the Supreme Court has explained, “[a] State has a compelling interest in preserving \n6 \nthe integrity of the election process.”  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006) (quoting Eu \n7 \n8  v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 231 (1989)).  The Court \n9 \nwent on to state that “[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the \n10 \nfunctioning of our participatory democracy.  Voter fraud drives honest citizens out of the \n11 \ndemocratic process and breeds distrust of our government.  Voters who fear their legitimate \n12 \n13 \nvotes will be outweighed by fraudulent ones will feel disenfranchised.”  Id.  The AZ Laws \n14 \nserve this purpose by ensuring that only eligible voters are registered to participate in the \n15 \nelectoral process.   \n16 \n17  While it is true that Arizona must “accept and use” the Federal Form, the NVRA \n18 \npermits states to “develop and use a mail voter registration form that meets all of the criteria \n19 \nstated in section 9(b)[.]”  52 U.S.C. § 20505 (a)(2).  As noted by the Supreme Court, while \n20 \n21  “the NVRA imposes certain mandates on states, describing those mandates in detail[,]” it \n22 \n“still leaves [the states] room for policy choice.”  Young v. Fordice, 520 U.S. 273, 286 \n23 \n(1997).   \n24 \nArizona’s “policy choice” to require evidence of citizenship on its state mail voter \n25 \n26  registration form is within the bounds of the NVRA.  First, the NVRA provides what a mail \n27 \nregistration form “may require . . . to assess the eligibility of the applicant.”  52 U.S.C. § \n28 \n \n9 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 17 of 25\n \n1  20508(b)(1)  (emphasis  added).    But  “[t]he  NVRA  does  not  list,  for  example,  all  other \n2 \ninformation the State may—or may not—provide or request.”  Young, 520 U.S. at 286.  \n3 \nBecause  Section  9(b)  does  not  contain  any  prohibitions  on  requiring  that  documentary \n4 \nevidence be submitted in conjunction with a mail voter registration, states are free to require \n5 \n6  such information.  Accordingly, the fact that the Federal Form does not require documentary \n7 \nproof of citizenship does not preclude states from requiring such information on their own \n8 \nforms. \n9 \n10  Next the NVRA indicates what mail registration forms must contain.  It provides that \n11 \nthe registration form “shall include a statement that specifies each eligibility requirement \n12 \n(including citizenship); contains an attestation that the applicant meets such requirement; and \n13 \nrequires the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury.”  52 U.S.C. § 20508(b)(2) \n14 \n15  (emphases added).  The only prohibition is found in subsection (b)(3), which provides that the \n16 \nregistration  form  “may  not  include  any  requirement  for  notarization  or  other  formal \n17 \nauthentication.”  52 U.S.C. § 20508(b)(3).  The Arizona mail voter registration form does not \n18 \n19  violate any of these provisions. \n20 \nAdditionally, the Supreme Court was clear in ITAC that “state-developed forms may \n21 \nrequire information the Federal Form does not.”  ITAC, 570 U.S. at 12.  Therefore, under the \n22 \nNVRA, “States retain the flexibility to design and use their own registration forms.”  Id.  \n23 \n24 \nThus, Arizona is free to require more information on and documentary evidence with its own \n25 \nmail registration form than is required by the Federal Form.  Id.  The purpose of the Federal \n26 \nForm is to provide a simple, streamlined method for voter registration, not to interfere with \n27 \n28  the states’ authority to conduct elections. \n \n10 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  C. The NVRA does not prevent the states from purging ineligible voters \nfrom the voter rolls. \n2 \n \nThe NVRA requires that states “conduct a general program that makes a reasonable \n3 \n4  effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by \n5 \nreason of the death of the registrant; or a change in address of the registrant.”  52 U.S.C. § \n6 \n20507(a)(4).    It  further  provides  examples  of  how  states  may  conduct  these  programs, \n7 \n8  including the requirement that such programs to be completed “not later than 90 days prior to \n9 \nthe date of a primary or general election for Federal office.”  52 U.S.C. § 20507(c).  Finally, \n10 \nnames are not to be removed for change of residence reasons absent written confirmation of \n11 \nan address change or failure to respond to written notice combined with failure to vote.  52 \n12 \n13 \nU.S.C. § 20507(d).   \n14 \nHB 2243 complies with these requirements.  Because the NVRA does not prohibit the \n15 \nstates from removing voters based on ineligibility, Arizona is free to remove persons it has \n16 \n17  determined are not U.S. citizens.  \n18 \nII. PLAINTIFFS  CONSTITUTIONAL  CLAIMS  SHOULD  BE  DISMISSED \n19  BECAUSE THEY FAIL THE ANDERSON-BURDICK TEST. \n \n20 \nAs explained above, the right of citizens to vote is fundamental.  This fundamental \n21 \nright encompasses more than just the ability to cast one’s vote; equal participation among \n22 \ncitizens is also guaranteed.  See Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336 (1972) (explaining that \n23 \n24  “a citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an equal basis \n25 \nwith other citizens in the jurisdiction.”); Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000) (“The right to \n26 \nvote is protected in more than the initial allocation of the franchise.  Equal protection applies \n27 \n28  as well to the manner of exercise.”).  See also Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 17 (explaining that \n \n11 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  “[o]ur constitution leaves no room for classification of people in a way that unnecessarily \n2 \nabridges this right.”).  Although the States have broad constitutional authority to regulate who \n3 \nmay vote and how they may do so, “the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate \n4 \ntreatment, value one person’s vote over that of another.”  Bush, 531 U.S. at 104-05. \n5 \n6  The Supreme Court applies what is known as the Anderson-Burdick framework when \n7 \nanalyzing whether a state’s election law violates due process or equal protection.  See Dudum \n8 \nv. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1106 n.15 (9th Cir. 2011) (explaining that “[t]he Supreme Court has \n9 \n10  addressed such claims collectively using a single analytic framework.”).  The Ninth Circuit \n11 \nexplained that “[w]hen the burdens on voting imposed by the government are severe, strict \n12 \nscrutiny applies . . . . But voting regulations are rarely subjected to strict scrutiny.”  Id. at \n13 \n1106.  Such “non-severe lesser burdens on voting” are subject to “less exacting review, and a \n14 \n15  State’s  important  regulatory  interest  will  usually  be  enough  to  justify  reasonable, \n16 \nnondiscriminatory restrictions.”  Id. \n17 \nBecause “[e]lection laws will invariably impose some burden upon individual voters,” \n18 \n19  the standard of review is “flexible.”   Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433-34 (1992).  \n20 \nAccordingly, the reviewing court “must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted \n21 \ninjury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks \n22 \nto vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the \n23 \n24 \nburden imposed by its rule, taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make \n25 \nit necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.”  Id. at 434 (citation and internal quotation marks \n26 \nomitted).  See also Crawford, 553 U.S. at 190 (“We reaffirmed Anderson’s requirement that a \n27 \n28  court evaluating a constitutional challenge to an election regulation weigh the asserted injury \n \n12 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  to the right to vote against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for \n2 \nthe burden imposed by this rule.”) (citation omitted).   \n3 \nThe  key  question  is  whether  the  burden  is  “severe”  or  “reasonable  [and] \n4 \nnondiscriminatory.”  Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434.  Where the burden imposed by a state election \n5 \n6  law is severe, strict scrutiny applies.  See Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 677 (9th Cir. 2018) \n7 \n(explaining that “the Constitution permits states to impose some burdens on voters through \n8 \nelection regulations, and it requires strict scrutiny of those regulations only where the burden \n9 \n10  imposed is severe.”).  As the Supreme Court has explained, “because a government has such \n11 \na compelling interest in securing the right to vote freely and effectively, this Court never has \n12 \nheld a State ‘to the burden of demonstrating empirically the objective effects on political \n13 \nstability that [are] produced’ by the voting regulation in question.”  Burson v. Freeman, 504 \n14 \n15  U.S. 191, 210 (1992) (quoting Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195 (1986)). \n16 \nHB 2492 contains burdens for applicants that are minimal and thus do not warrant \n17 \nstrict  scrutiny.    See  Crawford,  553  U.S.  at  205  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring)  (“Ordinary  and \n18 \n19  widespread burdens, such as those requiring nominal effort of everyone, are not severe.”).  \n20 \nThe Crawford court held that voter ID requirements for in person voting survived Anderson-\n21 \nBurdick review, explaining that the “inconvenience” of obtaining the required documents \n22 \n“surely does not qualify as a substantial burden.”  Id. at 198.  HB 2492 provides applicants \n23 \n24 \nwith several options to establish residency and citizenship, including but not limited to state \n25 \nidentification cards, utility bills, and tribal enrollment cards.   \n26 \nBecause the burdens imposed by the AZ Laws are not severe, the court need only \n27 \n28  determine whether the state’s interest is sufficient to justify the regulation.  Timmons v. Twin \n \n13 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997) (“Lesser burdens . . . trigger less exacting \n2 \nreview,  and  a  State’s  important  regulatory  interest  will  usually  be  enough  to  justify \n3 \nreasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.”).  See also, Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d \n4 \n423, 428-30 (6th Cir. 2012) (explaining that the “courts must weigh the burden on voters \n5 \n6  against the state’s asserted justifications and make the hard judgment that our adversary \n7 \nsystem demands.”) (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court has recognized that “[a] State \n8 \nindisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.”  \n9 \n10  Purcell, 549 U.S. at 4.  See also Brnovich v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2340 \n11 \n(2021) (listing “prevention of fraud” and “[e]nsuring every vote is cast freely” as important \n12 \nstate  interests).    The  Anderson-Burdick  standard  is  satisfied  because  the  AZ  Laws  are \n13 \n“reasonably related” to Arizona’s interests in securing free and fair elections in the state.  \n14 \n15  Additionally, the AZ Laws would survive even if the Court determined that traditional \n16 \nequal protection analysis should be applied instead of the Anderson-Burdick test.  There is no \n17 \nequal protection violation where a law “is neutral on its face and rationally may be said to \n18 \n19  serve a purpose the Government is constitutionally empowered to pursue.”  Washington v. \n20 \nDavis, 426 U.S. 229, 246 (1976).  The AZ Laws were enacted to advance the important state \n21 \ninterest of protecting the integrity of state and federal elections.  News Release, Rep. Jake \n22 \nHoffman  (Mar.  30,  2022), \n23 \n24 \nhttps://www.azleg.gov/press/house/55LEG/2R/220330HOFFMANHB2492.pdf  (describing \n25 \nHB 2492 as “a giant step toward ensuring elections are easy, convenient, and secure in our \n26 \nstate.”).  See also Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Reagan, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77690, at *58 \n27 \n28 \n \n14 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  (D. Ariz. May 8, 2018) (“Fraud prevention and preserving public confidence in election \n2 \nintegrity are facially important state regulatory interests.”).  As the Supreme Court explained, \n3 \n[t]here is no question about the legitimacy or importance of the \n4  State’s  interest  in  counting  only  the  votes  of  eligible  voters.  \nMoreover,  the  interest  in  orderly  administration  and  accurate \n5 \nrecordkeeping  provides  a  sufficient  justification  for  carefully \n6  identifying all voters participating in the election process.  While \nthe most effective method of preventing election fraud may well \n7 \nbe debatable, the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear. \n8   \nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 196. \n9 \n10  Finally,  Plaintiffs’  discriminatory  purpose  equal  protection  claims  also  must  fail.  \n11 \nWhile true that “[a] facially neutral law . . . warrants strict scrutiny . . . if it can be proved that \n12 \nthe law was motivated by a racial purpose or object[,]” Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 546 \n13 \n(1999)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted),  Plaintiffs’  complaints  contain  no  evidence  of \n14 \n15  improper racial motivation.  Under the Arlington Heights standard, “[d]etermining whether \n16 \ninvidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into \n17 \nsuch circumstantial and direct evidence as may be available.”  Vill. of Arlington Heights v. \n18 \n19  Metro Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266) (1977).  While “[d]isproportionate impact is not \n20 \nirrelevant . . . it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial discrimination.  Proof of \n21 \nracially  discriminatory  intent  or  purpose  is  required  to  show  a  violation  of  the  Equal \n22 \nProtection Clause.”  Id. at 264-65 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).  Here, “the \n23 \n24 \nabsence  of  proof  of  discriminatory  intent  forecloses  any  claim  that  the  official  action \n25 \nchallenged in this case violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”  \n26 \nMemphis v. Greene, 451 U.S. 100, 119 (1981).   \n27 \n28 \n \n15 \n   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 131-1   Filed 09/22/22   Page 23 of 25\n \n1  According  to  the  Supreme  Court,  “[d]iscriminatory  purpose  .  .  .  implies  that  the \n2 \ndecisionmaker . . . selected . . . a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ of, \n3 \nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.’”  Hernandez v. New \n4 \nYork, 500 U.S. 352, 360 (1991) (quoting Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 \n5 \n6  U.S.  256,  279  (1979)).    Arlington  Heights  supplies  examples  of  how  to  establish \n7 \ndiscriminatory intent, yet Plaintiffs’ various complaints do not contain any such evidence.  \n8 \nVill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68 (examples include but are not limited to“[t]he \n9 \n10  impact  of  the  official  action;”  “[t]he  historical  background  of  the  decision;”  and  “[t]he \n11 \nlegislative or administrative history”).  Indeed, the bill had the opposite intent, to ensure \n12 \nfairness to all Arizona residents and prevent election fraud.

(Doc. 348, Mot. to Intervene; \n18  Doc.  363,  04/26/2023  Order.)  The  Legislators  then  invoked  legislative  privilege  in \n19  response to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests. (See, e.g., Doc. 500-1, Ex. D.) Non-US Plaintiffs \n20  sought to compel discovery. (Doc. 502, Hr’g. Tr. at 87:7–88:9.) The Court ordered the \n21  parties to submit simultaneous briefs on the issue of whether the legislative privilege \n22  applies, which the parties filed on August 2, 2023. (Doc. 499, Defs.’ Br.; Doc. 500, Pls.’ \n23  Br.; Hr’g. Tr. at 87:7–88:20.)  \n24  I.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n25  The history of this litigation is set out in the Court’s previous Orders. (E.g., Doc. \n26  304, 02/15/2023 Order.) Plaintiffs claim that two recently enacted laws, H.B. 2243 and \n27  H.B. 2492 (the “Voting Laws”), are unlawful because they violate multiple federal laws \n28  and provisions of the Constitution.  (E.g., Doc. 67, LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 329–35; Doc. 1, \n \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 2 of 9\n \n \n \n1  22-cv-1381,  AAANHPI  Compl.  ¶¶  143–50.)  No  Plaintiff  named  the  Legislators  as \n2  defendants. (Pls.’ Br. at 1.) However, under Arizona law, both the Speaker and President \n3  are “entitled to be heard” “[i]n any proceeding in which a state statute . . . is alleged to be \n4  unconstitutional.”  A.R.S.  § 12-1841(A).  The  Speaker  and  the  President  may  in  their \n5  discretion either (1) intervene as a party, (2) file briefs in the lawsuit, or (3) choose not to \n6  participate in the lawsuit. Id. § 12-1841(D). The Legislators moved to intervene “in their \n7  official  capacities,  and  on  behalf  of  their  respective  legislative  chambers.”  (Mot.  to \n8  Intervene at 4.) Plaintiffs assert that the Legislators have since invoked the legislative \n9  privilege to “refuse to answer deposition questions regarding the enactment of the [Voting \n10  Laws], and . . . have objected to designating anyone to testify on behalf of their respective \n11  chambers under [Rule] 30(b)(6)” despite intervening to defend the Voting Laws on the \n12  merits. (Pls.’ Br. at 1–3.)  \n13  II.  LEGAL STANDARD & ANALYSIS \n14  Legislative immunity grants state legislators “protection from criminal, civil, or \n15  evidentiary process that interferes with their ‘legitimate legislative activity.’” Puente Ariz. \n16  v. Arpaio, 314 F.R.D. 664, 669 (D. Ariz. 2016) (quoting Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. \n17  367, 376 (1951)); Sup. Ct. of Va. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 732 \n18  (1980) (explaining that the legislative immunity of state legislators is “similar in origin and \n19  rationale” to that of Congresspeople). The legislative privilege, a corollary to legislative \n20  immunity, is a qualified privilege that shields legislators from compulsory evidentiary \n21  process. Mi Familia Vota v. Hobbs, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2023 WL 4595824, at *4 (D. Ariz. \n22  July 18, 2023); see United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 370–73 (1980) (limiting the \n23  scope of the legislative privilege for state legislators “where important federal interests are \n24  at stake, as in the enforcement of federal criminal statutes”). The legislative privilege is \n25  personal to each legislator. Puente Ariz., 314 F.R.D. at 671. \n26  A.  The Legislators Waived the Legislative Privilege \n27  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Legislators  have  waived  their  legislative  privilege  by \n28  voluntarily intervening in this lawsuit and putting their intent at issue. (Pls.’ Br. at 5–7.) \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 3 of 9\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs direct the Court to Powell v. Ridge, in which plaintiffs sued the Pennsylvania \n2  governor and state officials claiming that the public education funding system was racially \n3  discriminatory. 247 F.3d 520, 522 (3d Cir. 2001). Leaders of the state legislature intervened \n4  in the lawsuit, “citing their financial and legal interests in the litigation and the need to \n5  ‘articulate to the Court the unique perspective of the legislative branch of the Pennsylvania \n6  government.’” Id. at 522–23. The legislators “explicitly concurred” in the other defendants’ \n7  motion to dismiss but asserted the legislative privilege after the plaintiffs sought discovery. \n8  Id. at 523. The district court compelled discovery, after which the legislators appealed. Id. \n9  In dismissing the legislators’ interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Third Circuit \n10  explained that the legislators “stray[ed] far beyond the bounds of traditional legislative \n11  immunity” by fashioning a “privilege which would allow them to continue to actively \n12  participate in [the] litigation by submitting briefs, motions, and discovery requests of their \n13  own, yet allow them to refuse to comply with, and most likely, appeal from every adverse \n14  order.” Id. at 525. \n15  The  Legislators  argue  that  Powell  is  distinguishable  because  the  intervening \n16  defendants “had no statutory authority to intervene,” whereas the Legislators “intervened \n17  in their official capacities pursuant to A.R.S. § 12-1841(D) to present their views on the \n18  State’s interests.” (Defs.’ Br. at 7.) This argument would allow the Arizona Legislature to \n19  exercise its self-created right to intervene yet shield its leaders from ever waiving the \n20  legislative privilege. Like the defendants in  Powell, the Legislators “are not seeking \n21  immunity from this suit,” but instead seek to “actively participate in this litigation” yet \n22  avoid the burden of discovery regarding their legislative activities. Powell, 247 F.3d at 525. \n23  Plaintiffs did not seek discovery from the Legislators until the Legislators sought to “fully \n24  defend the laws passed by the legislature.” (Mot. to Intervene at 4, 11.) The Legislators \n25  also specifically put their own motives for passing the Voting Laws at issue when denying \n26  Plaintiffs’  allegations  that  the  Arizona  Legislature  enacted  the  Voting  Laws  with \n27  discriminatory intent. (Pls.’ Br. at 6; see, e.g., Doc. 348-1, Ex. A, Ans. to AAANHPI \n28  Compl.  at  16–18  ¶¶  131,  147–50,  (denying  allegations  that  the  Voting  Laws  are \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 4 of 9\n \n \n \n1  intentionally discriminatory); Doc. 348-1, Ex. A, Ans. to LUCHA Compl. at 98 ¶¶ 337–38 \n2  (same).)  \n3  The Legislators contend that they have not waived the privilege because their \n4  defense relies “solely upon the publicly available legislative history materials” instead of \n5  any  privileged  information  or  the  testimony  of  any  legislator  “regarding  his  or  her \n6  consideration of or passage of” the Voting Laws. (Defs.’ Br. at 4–6.) The Legislators cite \n7  Democratic National Committee v. Arizona Secretary of State’s Office, which considered \n8  whether political party and civic organization plaintiffs waived their First Amendment \n9  privilege by challenging state election laws. No. CV-16-01065-PHX-DLR, 2017 WL \n10  3149914, at *4 (D. Ariz. July 25, 2017). In finding that the plaintiffs had not waived the \n11  privilege, the court noted that the plaintiffs used only publicly available information to \n12  support their claims and that “[t]he privileged information that the State Defendants \n13  [sought] evidently include[d] a substantial amount of proprietary predictive modeling and \n14  strategic communications, none of which go to the heart of the case or to the State \n15  Defendants’ defense.” Id. at *4–5 (emphasis added).  \n16  The Court is not persuaded by the Legislators’ argument. Though the Legislators \n17  “avow[] to the Court” that they will not rely on privileged information in support of their \n18  defense, the information sought in discovery does in fact “go to the heart” of Plaintiffs \n19  claims and the constitutionality of the Voting Laws. Id. at 5; (Defs.’ Br. at 6; see Plfs.’ Br. \n20  at 6.) “Motive is often most easily discovered by examining the unguarded acts and \n21  statements of those who would otherwise attempt to conceal evidence of discriminatory \n22  intent.” Harris v. Ariz. Indep. Redistricting Comm’n, 993 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1071 (D. Ariz. \n23  2014) (quoting Cano v. Davis, 193 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1181–82 (C.D. Cal. 2002) (Reinhardt, \n24  J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). And contrary to the Legislators’ argument, \n25  the Court is not “[a]pplying a blanket waiver of legislative privilege” whenever Arizona’s \n26  legislative leaders intervene under § 12-1841(D), but instead finds that the Speaker and \n27  President each waived their privilege by intervening to “fully defend” the Voting Laws and \n28  putting their motives at issue. (See Defs.’ Br. at 3.)  \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 5 of 9\n \n \n \n1  The Legislators assert that finding waiver would undermine the purpose of allowing \n2  for  legislative  participation  in  federal  lawsuits,  specifically,  that  “[p]ermitting  the \n3  participation  of  lawfully  authorized  state  agents  promotes  informed  federal-court \n4  decisionmaking and avoids the risk of setting aside duly enacted state law based on an \n5  incomplete understanding of relevant state interests.” (Id. at 2–3 (quoting Berger v. N.C. \n6  State Conf. of the NAACP, 142 S. Ct. 2191, 2202 (2022)). However, the Berger Court \n7  analyzed only whether legislative leaders possessed a legitimate interest to intervene in the \n8  lawsuit under Rule 24; the legislative privilege was not at issue. 142 S. Ct. at 2201–03 \n9  (“[F]ederal courts should rarely question that a State’s interests will be practically impaired \n10  or impeded if its duly authorized representatives are excluded from participating in federal \n11  litigation challenging state law.”). But the legislative privilege’s animating purpose is “to \n12  allow duly elected legislators to discharge their public duties without concern of adverse \n13  consequences outside the ballot box,” and “minimize[e] the distraction of diverting their \n14  time, energy, and attention from their legislative tasks to defend the litigation.” Lee v. City \n15  of Los Angeles, 908 F.3d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 2018) (citation and internal quotation marks \n16  omitted) (cleaned up); Kay v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes, No. CV 02–03922 MMM RZ, \n17  2003 WL 25294710, at *11 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2003) (indicating that the “underlying \n18  policy  goal”  of  the  privilege  is  to  “protect[]  legislators  from  interference  with  their \n19  legislative  duties”  (citation  omitted)).  “[T]he  only  reasonable  inference  from  the \n20  Legislators’ litigation conduct is that they have decided to forego that ‘protection’ in \n21  pursuit of an opportunity to defend in court their decisions as legislators . . . .” Singleton v. \n22  Merrill, 576 F. Supp. 3d 931, 941 (N.D. Ala. 2021) (cleaned up) (observing that the \n23  intervening legislator defendants “put in issue the very facts that they now assert their \n24  immunity covers”). \n25  The Court finds that the Legislators have waived their legislative privilege.1 The \n26  Legislators must produce communications sent or received by either the Speaker or the \n27 \n \n1 Because the Court finds that the Speaker and President have waived the legislative \n28 \nprivilege,  it  need  not  consider  Plaintiffs’  argument  that  the  balance  of  factors  favor \novercoming the privilege. (See Pls.’ Br. at 7–9.) \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 6 of 9\n \n \n \n1  President which have been withheld on legislative privilege grounds. Plaintiffs may also \n2  depose the Legislators about their personal perspectives of the Voting Laws’ legislative \n3  process. (See Pls.’ Br. at 2–3.) However, “[t]he legislative privilege ‘is a personal one,’” \n4  and the Speaker or President could not waive the privilege for their fellow legislators. \n5  Puente Ariz., 314 F.R.D. at 671 (quoting Marylanders for Fair Representation, Inc. v. \n6  Schaefer, 144 F.R.D. 292, 298 (D. Md. 1992)). To the extent Plaintiffs seek information \n7  held by other members of the Arizona Legislature, it remains protected by the legislative \n8  privilege.  \n9  B.  Plaintiffs May Not Depose the Arizona Legislature as an Entity \n10  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) permits a party to depose a “public or \n11  private corporation, a partnership, an association, a governmental agency, or other entity,” \n12  which then “must designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents . . . to \n13  testify on its behalf.” Plaintiffs seek to depose the Arizona House of Representatives and \n14  the Arizona Senate and assert that the Speaker and the President “have necessitated \n15  deposition testimony with respect to the legislature as an entity” by intervening “on behalf \n16  of their respective legislative chambers.” (Pls.’ Br. at 9–10.) Specifically, Plaintiffs seek to \n17  depose  the  Arizona  Legislature  about  (1)  the  Legislature’s  “drafting,  introduction, \n18  amendment, passage, and enactment” of the Voting Laws, (2) the Legislature’s objectives, \n19  motives, and information considered when drafting and passing the Voting Laws, and (3) \n20  individual legislators’ communications with other legislators or third parties. (See Doc. \n21  499-1, Ex. 1, at 5–7.) The Legislators counter that Plaintiffs seek information protected by \n22  the legislative privilege and that a 30(b)(6) deposition is “unworkable in terms of preparing \n23  and identifying a single witness who can present binding testimony on behalf of the” \n24  Arizona Legislature. (Defs.’ Br. at 8.)  \n25  The Court agrees with the Legislators that a 30(b)(6) deposition of the Arizona \n26  Legislature  “would  effectively  force  a  waiver  of  every  single  legislator’s  individual \n27  legislative  privilege.  (Defs.’  Br.  at  8.)  In  Alliance  for  Global  Justice  v.  District  of \n28  Columbia, plaintiffs sought to compel the District of Columbia to produce a Rule 30(b)(6) \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 7 of 9\n \n \n \n1  deponent to testify about the District Council’s “collective knowledge” of its investigation \n2  into the District’s “policing of mass demonstrations.” 437 F. Supp. 2d 32, 34–35 (D.D.C. \n3  2006). The District asserted that the Council’s investigative activities were protected by \n4  the District’s speech and debate statute.2 Id. at 36. In declining to compel the District to \n5  produce a Rule 30(b)(6) deponent, the court explained: \n6  [T]he  [District’s]  speech  and  debate  statute  shields  from  discovery  the \nCouncil’s  knowledge  and  views  of  the  report  and  of  District  policies. \n7  Plaintiffs are seeking testimony relating to a Council investigation, which \nwas conducted as part of the Council’s deliberative and legislative process. \n8  They also appear to be seeking testimony about the Council’s understanding \nand interpretation of its own statutes. Both areas of testimony clearly fall \n9  within the “legislative sphere” and are shielded by the District’s speech and \ndebate statute. Therefore, to the extent that plaintiffs are arguing that the \n10  “collective knowledge” of the District includes the knowledge of and views \nof the Council, plaintiffs are not entitled to such testimony. The fact that \n11  plaintiffs seek to obtain the Council’s knowledge and views via a Rule \n30(b)(6) deponent and disclaim any intention of directly questioning any \n12  Council member or staff is irrelevant. By its very nature, a Rule 30(b)(6) \ndeposition  notice  requires  the  responding  party  to  prepare  a  designated \n13  representative [to testify] . . . on matters reasonably known by the responding \nentity. That preparation would require the very type of intrusion into the \n14  Council’s  legislative  activities  that  the  speech  and  debate  statute  was \nintended to prevent. \n15 \n16  Id. at 37 (emphasis added). \n17    Here, Plaintiffs similarly seek to compel the Arizona Legislature to designate (a) \n18  deponent(s) who “can testify as to the collective knowledge” of the Legislature.3 (See Pls.’ \n19 \n \n2 Though the court in Alliance for Global Justice considered the Council’s evidentiary \n20 \nprivilege in the context of the District’s speech and debate statute, this does not change this \nCourt’s analysis. Legislative immunity for state legislators derives from the “interpretation \n21 \nof federal law” and does “not depend on the presence of a speech or debate clause in the \nconstitution of any State.” Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg’l Planning Agency, 440 \n22 \nU.S. 391, 404 (1979) (citing Tenney, 341 U.S. at 377); Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 446 \nU.S. at 732 (1980). And the logic underscoring legislative immunity “supports extending \n23 \nthe corollary legislative privilege” to state legislators as well. Lee, 908 F.3d at 1187; see \nMi Familia Vota, 2023 WL 4595824, at *7 (explaining that “both the legislative privilege \n24 \nand legislative immunity ‘involve the core question whether a lawmaker may be made to \nanswer—either in terms of questions or in terms of defending from prosecution’” (quoting \n25 \nLa Union Del Pueblo Entero v. Abbott, 68 F.4th 228, 237 (5th Cir. 2023))).  \n3 The parties dispute whether the appropriate defendants are the Speaker and the President \n26 \nor the Arizona House of Representatives and the Arizona Senate. (Doc. 500-1, Ex. C, at \n45–46; Doc. 500-1, Ex. D, at 50.) The Court need not decide who is the appropriate \n27 \ndefendant, as the legislative privilege shields the Arizona Legislature’s legislative activities \nregardless. See All. for Glob. Justice, 437 F. Supp. 2d at 37 (“Regardless of who is the \n28 \ndefendant, the speech and debate statute shields from discovery the Council’s knowledge . \n. . .”). \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 8 of 9\n \n \n \n1  Br. at 9–10 (asserting that the Legislators “have necessitated deposition testimony with \n2  respect to the legislature as an entity”).) And Plaintiffs’ proposed deposition topics concern \n3  “legitimate legislative activities” that fall within the scope of the legislative privilege. \n4  Tenney, 341 U.S. at 376; see Miller v. Transamerican Press, Inc., 709 F.2d 524, 530 (9th \n5  Cir. 1983) (“Obtaining information pertinent to potential legislation or investigation is one \n6  of the things generally done in a session of the House, concerning matters within the \n7  legitimate legislative sphere.” (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)); Puente \n8  Ariz., 314 F.R.D. at  670–71 (finding the legislative  privilege protects “a legislator’s \n9  communications that bear on potential legislation” (citation and internal quotation marks \n10  omitted)); Mi Familia Vota, 2023 WL 4595824, at *8 (same); (Doc. 499-1, Ex. 1, at 5–7 \n11  (listing deposition topics).) The Court denies Plaintiffs’ request to compel the Arizona \n12  House of Representatives and Senate to prepare a 30(b)(6) deponent to testify as to these \n13  topics because doing so would intrude upon the protections afforded by the legislative \n14  privilege. All. for Glob. Justice, 437 F. Supp. 2d at 37; Puente Ariz. 314 F.R.D. at 671 \n15  (analyzing the Arizona Legislature’s waiver of the legislative privilege as an entity); see \n16  also  Marylanders  for  Fair  Representation,  144  F.R.D.  at  299  (finding  Maryland \n17  legislators’ preparation and consideration of a legislative redistricting plan fell “within the \n18  sphere of legitimate legislative activity” and “any inquiry into the Maryland Legislature’s \n19  consideration of [the plan] . . . [was] entirely barred” (second emphasis added)). \n20    Plaintiffs alternatively ask the Court to prevent the Legislators from presenting \n21  arguments on behalf of the Arizona Legislature and require the Legislators to instead \n22  participate as defendants in their individual capacities. (Pls.’ Br. at 10.) But the Speaker \n23  and the President are authorized to defend Arizona’s statutes and the Court declines to limit \n24  their right to represent the Arizona Legislature’s interests. A.R.S. § 12-1841(D); N.C. State \n25  Conf. of the NAACP, 142 S. Ct. at 2201 (explaining that “[s]tates possess ‘a legitimate \n26  interest in the continued enforcement of their own statutes,’” which may “be practically \n27  impaired  or  impeded  if  [their]  duly  authorized  representatives  are  excluded  from \n28  participating  in  federal  litigation  challenging  state  law”  (quoting  Cameron  v.  EMW \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 535   Filed 09/14/23   Page 9 of 9\n \n \n \n1  Women’s Surgical Ctr., P.S.C., 142 S. Ct. 1002, 1011 (2022)) (cleaned up) (emphasis \n2  added)). \n3  III.  CONCLUSION \n4    The  Speaker  and  the  President  have  waived  their  legislative  privilege  as  to \n5  information about their motives for the Voting Laws. The Speaker and President must \n6  produce communications that they have sent or received relating to the Voting Laws’ \n7  legislative process and have withheld on legislative privilege grounds. They may also be \n8  deposed  about  their  personal  involvement  in  the  Voting  Laws’  legislative  process. \n9  Plaintiffs may not however conduct a 30(b)(6) deposition of the Arizona Legislature. \n10    IT IS ORDERED granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel \n11  (Doc. 500).  \n12    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Speaker and the President must produce \n13  communications relating to the Voting Laws legislative process that they have sent or \n14  received and have withheld on legislative privilege grounds. \n15    Dated this 14th day of September, 2023. \n16   \n17   \n18   \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 9 - ",

The State incorporates by reference all arguments \n6  from its motion to dismiss (Doc. 127), as explained below. The State further moves to \n7  dismiss  count  I  of  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  brought  under  the  National  Voter \n8  Registration  Act  (“NVRA”),  52  U.S.C.  §§  20501–20511,  because  Plaintiffs  failed  to \n9  provide the notice required under 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(2) to assert a private right of action \n10  under the NVRA. \n11  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n12    Plaintiffs’ claims here are one of the many facial challenges to a recently enacted \n13  statute: HB 2492 (2022 Ariz. Sess. Laws Ch. 99). Plaintiffs assert two counts: a NVRA \n14  claim and a constitutional challenge. As part of their NVRA claim, Plaintiffs admit that they \n15  did not provide the statutorily required 30-day notice under § 20510(b)(3).  Instead, they \n16  allege that they had no obligation to provide such notice because “the violations alleged [] \n17  occurred within 30 days before the date of an election for federal office,” presumably \n18  referring to the 2022 election that occurred on November 8, 2022. (Doc. 21 ¶ 65.) However, \n19  Plaintiffs made no factual allegations that support that any NVRA violation occurred as a \n20  result of HB 2492 before the 2022 election.  And they cannot because HB 2492 will not \n21  take effect until January 1, 2023—which was nearly two months after the November 2022 \n22  election.   \n23  LEGAL STANDARD \n24  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires a complaint to include a “short and \n25  plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26  8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6), in turn, mandates dismissal if a plaintiff “fail[s] to state a claim upon \n27  which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  \n28 \n  \n- 2 -   \n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 197   Filed 12/27/22   Page 3 of 8\n \n1  “[A] dismissal for lack of statutory standing is properly viewed as a dismissal for \n2  failure to state a claim rather than a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” \n3  Vaughn v. Bay Env’t Mgmt., Inc., 567 F.3d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 2009). A plaintiff asserting \n4  a private right of action under the NVRA must comply with § 20510(b) to have statutory \n5  standing, and thus, to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Black Voters \n6  Matter Fund v. Raffensperger, 508 F. Supp. 3d 1283, 1292 (N.D. Ga. 2020). \n7  ARGUMENT \n8  A. Plaintiffs’ Claims Fail For The Reasons Previously Set Forth \n9  Plaintiffs’ constitutional and NVRA claims fail for the reasons previously set forth \n10  in the State’s consolidated motion to dismiss (Doc. 127), which the State incorporates by \n11  reference here. \nB. Plaintiffs’  NVRA  Claim  Also  Violates  The  Pre-Suit  Notification \n12 \nRequirement \n13 \n14 \nPlaintiffs’ NVRA claim fails also fails because they did not comply with NVRA’s \n15 \npre-suit notification mandate, which is found in 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b). Consequently, they \n16 \ndo not have statutory standing pursuant to § 20510(b) to assert a private right of action \n17 \nunder the NVRA, and dismissal of their NVRA claim is necessary. \n18 \n  “The NVRA creates a private right of action for ‘[a] person who is aggrieved by a \n19 \nviolation of [the NVRA].’” Nat’l Council of La Raza v. Cegavske, 800 F.3d 1032, 1035 (9th \n20 \nCir. 2015) (alteration in original) (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)). However, a person can \n21 \nonly assert an NVRA claim if the person “provide[s] written notice of the violation to the \n22 \nchief election official of the State involved.” 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(1)–(2). The State then \n23 \nhas “90 days after receipt of [the] notice” to correct the “violation” unless the NVRA \n24 \n“violation occurred within 120 days before the date of an election for Federal office.” Id. A \n25 \nplaintiff can only proceed with a private action without providing notice if “the violation \n26 \noccurred within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal Office.” Id. § 20510(b)(3); \n27 \nsee also Nat’l Council of La Raza, 800 F.3d at 1035 (outlining notice requirements).  \n28 \n  \n- 3 -   \n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 197   Filed 12/27/22   Page 4 of 8\n \n1  The NVRA’s pre-suit notice requirement “ensure[s] that the chief election officer is \n2  directly informed of a violation and is incentivized by the threat of litigation to correct the \n3  violation.” Black Voters Matter Fund, 508 F. Supp. 3d at 1295. A plaintiff who sues without \n4  complying with the notice provisions lacks statutory standing to proceed on an NVRA \n5  claim. Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir. 2014) (stating plaintiff’s “failure to \n6  provide notice is fatal to his suit”); Black Voters Matter Fund, 508 F. Supp. 3d at 1294–95 \n7  (dismissing NVRA claim where plaintiffs did not comply with notice provisions). Lack of \n8  statutory standing for a claim requires dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). See Vaughn, 567 F.3d \n9  at 1024; Black Voters Matter Fund, 508 F. Supp. 3d at 1294–95.  \n10  Here, Plaintiffs failed to comply with § 20510(b)’s notice requirements because they \n11  provided no pre-suit notice regarding the asserted NVRA violations at all. Dismissal of their \n12  NVRA claim is necessary. \n13    Plaintiffs allege in their Amended Complaint that “the violations alleged [] occurred \n14  within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal office,” so Plaintiffs do not need \n15  to provide notice under § 20510(b). (Doc. 21 ¶ 65.) However, Plaintiffs offer no factual \n16  allegations to support that any violations occurred within 30 days of any federal election.  \n17  That is because it is implausible—if not outright legally impossible—to allege that NVRA \n18  violations based on HB 2494 occurred when HB 2494 is not even in effect yet.  HB 2492 \n19  was unequivocally not in effect for the November 2022 election—it only takes effect on \n20  December 31, 2022. See 2022 Ariz. Legis. Serv. Ch. 174 § 4 (S.B. 1638) (“Laws 2022, \n21  chapter 99 is effective from and after December 31, 2022.”). It further was not in effect \n22  when  Plaintiffs  filed  their  Complaint;  it  was  not  in  effect  when  Plaintiffs  filed  their \n23  Amended Complaint; and it is not effect as of the date of filing this Motion. Nor can \n24  Plaintiffs be “aggrieved” by a statute not yet in effect. \n25    Plaintiffs’ insinuation in their Amended Complaint that there is some unknown \n26  “ongoing violation” through a citation to National Council of La Raza is not enough to save \n27  their NVRA claims. (Doc. 21 ¶ 65.) National Council of La Raza does not support that a \n28  plaintiff can merely say “ongoing violation” and sue within thirty days of an election to get \n  \n- 4 -   \n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 197   Filed 12/27/22   Page 5 of 8\n \n1  around § 20510(b). Instead, the court held that “[a] plaintiff can satisfy the NVRA’s notice \n2  provision by plausibly alleging that a[n] ongoing, systematic violation is occurring at the \n3  time the notice is sent or, if no notice is sent, when the complaint is filed within 30 days of \n4  a federal election.” Nat’l Council of La Raza, 800 F.3d at 1044 (emphasis added). There, \n5  the plaintiffs relied on field investigations and years of data that supported their NVRA \n6  claim, which adequately established that they properly pleaded there were ongoing and \n7  continuing violations. Id. at 1036, 1044. And the plaintiffs there even included this data and \n8  information from their field investigations in a pre-suit notice to the chief election officer. \n9  See id. By contrast, Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that support it is plausible that there \n10  are “ongoing, systematic violations” here, and they failed to provide any notice of the \n11  purported NVRA violations. Again, HB 2492 is not even in effect yet. In short, Plaintiffs \n12  cannot rely on an “ongoing, systemic violation” when they have alleged no facts in support. \n13  Dismissal of the NVRA claim is thus required. Plaintiffs did not provide notice of \n14  the NVRA violations asserted in their Amended Complaint. They therefore failed to comply \n15  with § 20510(b)’s pre-suit notice requirement, and they lack statutory standing to pursue a \n16  private right of action under the NVRA.  \n17  CONCLUSION \n18  Plaintiffs failed to follow the NVRA pre-suit notice requirements, and thus, their \n19  NVRA claim fails as a matter of law and is subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). \n20  Plaintiffs’ constitutional and NVRA claims also fail for the reasons described in the State’s \n21  consolidated motion to dismiss (Doc. 127). The State therefore respectfully requests that \n22  the Court dismiss the Amended Complaint.  \n23   \n   \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  \n- 5 -   \n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 197   Filed 12/27/22   Page 6 of 8\n \n1  RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 27th day of December, 2022. \n2  MARK BRNOVICH \nATTORNEY GENERAL \n3 \n \n4  By: s/ Drew C.

(Doc. 127, “Mot.”) For the following reasons, Defendants’ Motion is denied \n20  except as to Plaintiffs’ freestanding procedural due process claims.  \n21  I.  BACKGROUND \n22  This case arises out of two Arizona laws regulating voting registration, H.B. 2243 \n23  and H.B. 2492 (“the Voting Laws”). The Voting Laws, effective January 1, 2023, enable \n24  government officials to require heightened proof of citizenship from Arizona registrants \n25  and  mandate  certain  consequences  if  a  registrant  does  not  provide  such  proof.  (See \n26  generally  Doc.  169,  Poder  Latinx  Compl.)  Plaintiffs,  the  United  States  of  America \n27  (“United States”) and a collection of nonpublic entities (“Private Plaintiffs”), allege that \n28 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n1  the Voting Laws are  both statutorily and constitutionally unsound.1 (See, e.g., id. at \n2  ¶¶ 86–152.)   \n3  A.  Recent History of Arizona Voting Laws  \n4  Arizona has required documentary proof of citizenship (“DPOC”) from in-state \n5  voters since 2004. (Doc. 1, 22-cv-1124, USA Compl. ¶ 41.) An individual seeking to \n6  register to vote in Arizona state elections must provide one of the following forms of \n7  “evidence of citizenship”:  \n1.  The  number  of  the  applicant’s  driver  license  or  nonoperating \n8 \nidentification license issued after October 1, 1996 by the department of \ntransportation  or  the  equivalent  governmental  agency  of  another  state \n9 \nwithin the United States if the agency indicates on the applicant’s driver \nlicense or nonoperating identification license that the person has provided \n10 \nsatisfactory proof of United States citizenship.  \n11   \n2.  A  legible  photocopy  of  the  applicant’s  birth  certificate  that  verifies \n12  citizenship to the satisfaction of the county recorder.  \n \n13  3. A legible photocopy of pertinent pages of the applicant’s United States \npassport identifying the applicant and the applicant’s passport number or \n14  presentation  to  the  county  recorder  of  the  applicant’s  United  States \npassport.  \n15   \n4. A presentation to the county recorder of the applicant’s United States \n16  naturalization documents or the number of the certificate of naturalization. \nIf  only  the  number  of  the  certificate  of  naturalization  is  provided,  the \n17  applicant shall not be included in the registration rolls until the number of \nthe  certificate  of  naturalization  is  verified  with  the  United  States \n18  immigration and naturalization service by the county recorder.  \n \n19  5. Other documents or methods of proof that are established pursuant to the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  \n20 \n \n1 Plaintiff Mi Familia Vota describes itself as “a national, non-profit civic engagement \n21 \norganization with a mission of uniting Latino, immigrant, and allied communities to \npromote social and economic justice through increased civic participation by encouraging \n22 \nleadership development, citizenship, and issue organizing.” (Doc. 65, Mi Familia Vota \nCompl. ¶ 16.) It “encourages non-partisan voter registration and voter participation and \n23 \nhas challenged voter suppression around the nation.” (Id.) Similarly, Plaintiff Voto Latino \n“is  a  501(c)(4)  nonprofit,  social  welfare  organization  that  engages,  educates,  and \n24 \nempowers Latinx communities across the United States, working to ensure that Latinx \nvoters are enfranchised and included in the democratic process. In furtherance of its \n25 \nmission, Voto Latino expends significant resources to register and mobilize thousands of \nLatinx voters each election cycle.” (Id. ¶ 19.) “Voto Latino considers eligible Latinx \n26 \nvoters in Arizona to be the core of its constituency.” (Id.) Apart from the United States, \nthe  remaining  Plaintiffs  allege  similar  interests  in  maximizing  voter  turnout  among \n27 \ncertain communities, including Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Democratic \nvoters in general. (See, e.g., Doc. 1, 22-cv-1381, AZ AANHPI For Equity Coalition \n28 \nCompl. (“AAANHPI Compl.”) ¶¶ 30–31; Doc. 67, Living United for Change in Arizona \nAm. Compl. (“LUCHA Compl.”) ¶¶ 254–60.)   \n \n- 2 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1   \n6. The applicant’s Bureau of Indian affairs card number, tribal treaty card \n2  number or tribal enrollment number.  \n3  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-166(F). \n4     In addition to providing applicants a State Form to register for state and federal \n5  elections, Arizona also provides a form created by the United States Election Assistance \n6  Commission,  known as the  Federal Form, to register  for federal  elections only. See \n7  Gonzales v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 394 (9th Cir. 2012). The Federal Form requires \n8  applicants to check a box under penalty of perjury indicating that they are citizens of the \n9  United States (“Check Box Requirement”). (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 42.)  \n10  Arizona had previously imposed a DPOC requirement on applicants using the \n11  Federal  Form.  In  2004,  Arizona  passed  a  law  requiring  all  applicants  for  voter \n12  registration, regardless of whether they used the Federal or State Form, to provide DPOC \n13  in order to register. (USA Compl. ¶ 41.) In 2013, the United States Supreme Court held \n14  that the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”) preempted Arizona’s requirement as \n15  applied to applicants using the Federal Form. See Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of \n16  Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 20 (2013). The Federal Form contains “only such identifying \n17  information (including the signature of the applicant) and other information (including \n18  data relating to previous registration by the applicant), as is necessary to enable the \n19  appropriate  State  election  official  to  assess  the  eligibility  of  the  applicant  and  to \n20  administer  voter  registration  and  other  parts  of  the  election  process.”  52  U.S.C. \n21  § 20508(b)(1). Because the NVRA mandates that states “accept and use” the Federal \n22  Form—which does not require applicants to provide DPOC—the Inter Tribal Court held \n23  that Arizona could not “requir[e] a Federal Form applicant to submit information beyond \n24  that required by the form itself,” including DPOC. 570 U.S. at 12, 20 (“States retain the \n25  flexibility to design and use their own registration forms, but the Federal Form provides a \n26  backstop: No matter what procedural hurdles a State’s own form imposes, the Federal \n27  Form guarantees that a simple means of registering to vote in federal elections will be \n28 \n \n- 3 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  available.”); (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 42.)2  \n2    Plaintiffs allege that ever since Inter Tribal Council, Arizona has attempted to \n3  disenfranchise certain  voters. In 2018, the  Arizona  Secretary of  State entered  into a \n4  Consent Decree with Plaintiff League of United Latin American Citizens (“LULAC”) \n5  after the nonprofit sued the state for allegedly discriminating against registrants who used \n6  the State Form without providing DPOC. (See Doc. 37, 2:17-cv-04102-DGC, LULAC \n7  Consent Decree; AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 46.) Plaintiffs explain that under the LULAC \n8  Consent Decree, Arizona must “(1) treat all registrants the same regardless of whether \n9  they  use  the  state  form  or  Federal  Form,  registering  all  voters  for  federal  elections \n10  regardless of provided evidence of citizenship; and (2) check the motor vehicles database \n11  for  citizenship  documentation  before  limiting  voters  to  federal-only  elections.”  (Mi \n12  Familia Vota Compl. ¶¶ 44–45.)  \n13  B.  The Voting Laws Passed in 2022 \n14  1.  H.B. 2492  \n15  Former Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed H.B. 2492 into law on March 30, \n16  2022. (See id. ¶ 3.) H.B. 2492 created additional requirements for individuals using either \n17  the Federal or State Form. Specifically, the statute mandates registrants show DPOC and \n18  Documentary Proof of Residence (“DPOR”) through the following provisions: \nRequirements for proper registration \n19 \nA person is presumed to be properly registered to vote on completion of a \nregistration form . . . that contains at least the name, the residence address \n20 \nor the location, proof of location of residence as prescribed by Section 16-\n123, the date and place of birth and the signature . . . of the registrant . . . \n21 \nand a checkmark or other appropriate mark in the “yes” box next to the \nquestion regarding citizenship. Any application for registration, including \n22 \nan  application  on  a  form  prescribed  by  the  United  States  Election \nAssistance Commission, must contain a checkmark or other appropriate \n23 \n \n24  2 The differences between Arizona’s state and federal voting registration create different \nvoter rolls depending on when a voter registered. As described by Plaintiffs: \n25 \nArizona has three classes of voters: (1) those who registered pre-2005 and \ndid not have to show documentary proof of citizenship (because Arizona \n26 \ndid  not  yet  require  it),  who  can  vote  in  all  elections;  (2)  those  who \nregistered  post-2005  using  the  [Federal  Form]  .  .  .  and  did  not  show \n27 \ndocumentary proof of citizenship, who can vote only in federal elections; \nand  (3)  those  who  registered  post-2005  and  showed  adequate  proof  of \n28 \ncitizenship, who can vote in all elections. \n(Mi Familia Vota Compl. ¶¶ 2, 43.) \n \n- 4 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  mark  in  the  “yes”  box  next  to  the  question  regarding  citizenship  as  a \ncondition of being  properly registered to  vote as either a voter  who is \n2  eligible to vote a full ballot or a voter who is eligible to vote only with a \nballot for federal offices. . . . \n3 \nProof of location of residence \nExcept for persons who register pursuant to Section 16-103, a person who \n4 \nregisters  to  vote  shall  provide  an  identifying  document  that  establishes \nproof of location of residence. Any of the identifying documents prescribed \n5 \nin Section 16-579, Subsection A, Paragraph 1 constitutes satisfactory proof \nof residence.  \n6 \nH.B. 2492 §§ 4(A), 5. The Federal Form does not require an applicant to list her place of \n7 \nbirth (“the Birthplace Requirement”). (See AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 63; DNC Compl. ¶ 41.) \n8 \nThe documents with which an individual can show DPOR are: \n9 \n(a)  A valid form of identification that bears the photograph, name and \n10  address of the elector that reasonably appear to be the same as the name and \naddress in the precinct register, including an Arizona driver license, an \n11  Arizona  nonoperating  identification  license,  a  tribal  enrollment  card  or \nother form of tribal identification or a United States federal, state or local \n12  government issued identification. Identification is deemed valid unless it \ncan be determined on its face that it has expired.   \n13   \n(b) Two different items that contain the name and address of the elector that \n14  reasonably appear to be the same as the name and address in the precinct \nregister, including a utility bill, a bank or credit union statement that is \n15  dated within ninety days of the date of the election, a valid Arizona vehicle \nregistration, an Arizona vehicle insurance card, an Indian census card, tribal \n16  enrollment  card  or  other  form  of  tribal  identification,  a  property  tax \nstatement, a recorder’s certificate, a voter registration card, a valid United \n17  States  federal,  state  or  local  government  issued  identification  or  any \nmailing  that  is  labeled  as  “official  election  material”.  Identification  is \n18  deemed valid unless it can be determined on its face that it has expired.   \n \n19  (c)  A valid form of identification that bears the photograph, name and \naddress of the elector except that if the address on the identification does \n20  not reasonably appear to be the same as the address in the precinct register \nor the identification is a valid United States military identification card or a \n21  valid United States passport and does not bear an address, the identification \nmust be accompanied by one of the items listed in subdivision (b) of this \n22  paragraph.   \n23  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-579(A)(1). Unlike preexisting Arizona law, H.B. 2492 contains no \n24  exceptions to the DPOR requirement for applicants who do not have numbered street \n25  addresses. (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 28, 40.) \n26  The statute also mandates different requirements for applicants using the Federal \n27  or State Form: \nExcept  for  a  form  produced  by  the  United  States  Election  Assistance \n28 \nCommission,  any  application  for  registration  shall  be  accompanied  by \n \n- 5 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  satisfactory  evidence  of  citizenship  as  prescribed  in  Section  16-166, \nSubsection F, and the County Recorder . . . shall reject any application for \n2  registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of citizenship.  \n3  H.B. 2492 § 4(C).  \nFederal only voters; early ballot; eligibility \n4 \n1.  A person who has registered to vote and who has not provided satisfactory \nevidence of citizenship as prescribed by Section 16-166, Subsection F is not \n5 \neligible to vote in presidential elections.  \n2.  A  person  who  has  not  provided  satisfactory  evidence  of  citizenship \n6 \npursuant to Section 16-166, Subsection F and who is eligible to vote only \nfor federal offices is not eligible to receive an early ballot by mail.   \n7 \nId. § 5(A).  \n8 \nThe statute places the burden on County Recorders to implement the provisions of \n9 \nH.B. 2492. A County Recorder “shall cancel a registration” when “the County Recorder \n10 \nreceives  and  confirms  information  that  the  person  registered  is  not  a  United  States \n11 \ncitizen.”  Id.  § 8(A)(10).  Election  officials  also  have  duties  to  verify  registrants’ \n12 \ncitizenship. “Within ten days after receiving an application for registration [through the \n13 \nFederal Form] that is not accompanied by [DPOC], the county recorder or other officer in \n14 \ncharge of elections shall use all available resources to verify the citizenship status of the \n15 \napplicant.” Id. § 4(D). The statute prescribes a specific verification process:  \n16 \n. . . [A]t a minimum, [the election official] shall compare the information \n17  available on the application for registration with the following, provided the \ncounty has access: \n18  1.  The Department of Transportation databases of Arizona diver licenses or \nnonoperating identification licenses. \n19   \n2.  The Social Security Administration databases. \n20   \n3.  The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Systemic Alien \n21  Verification for Entitlements program, if practicable. \n \n22  4.  A National Association for Public Health statistics and information systems \nelectronic verification of vital events system. \n23   \n5.  Any  other  state,  city,  town,  county  or  federal  database  and  any  other \n24  database relating to voter registration to which the County Recorder . . . has \naccess, including an electronic registration information center database.  \n25 \nId. \n26 \nThe statute provides for three different outcomes from this verification. First, if the \n27 \nelection official “matches the applicant with information that verifies the applicant is a \n28 \nUnited States citizen . . . the applicant shall be properly registered.” Id. § 4(E). Second, if \n \n- 6 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  the election official “matches the applicant with information that the applicant is not a \n2  United States citizen, the County Recorder . . . shall reject the application, notify the \n3  applicant that the applicant was rejected because the applicant is not a United States \n4  citizen and forward the application to the county attorney and  Attorney General for \n5  investigation.” Id. Third, if the election official “is unable to match the applicant with \n6  appropriate  citizenship  information,  the  [official]  shall  notify  the  applicant  that  [her \n7  citizenship could not be verified] and that the applicant will not be qualified to vote in a \n8  presidential election or by mail with an early ballot in any election until satisfactory \n9  evidence of citizenship is provided.” Id.  \n10  Lastly,  the  statute  provides  for  prosecution  of  certain  registrants  referred  for \n11  investigation. Election officials must “make available to the Attorney General a list of all \n12  individuals who are registered to vote and who have not provided satisfactory evidence of \n13  citizenship pursuant to Section 16-166.” Id. § 7(A). The Attorney General must then use \n14  “all available resources to verify the citizenship” of the referred applicants and “at a \n15  minimum shall compare the information available on the application for registration” \n16  with the same databases listed in § 4(D) of the statute. Id. § 7(B). “The Attorney General \n17  shall prosecute individuals who are found to not be United States citizens pursuant to \n18  Section 16-182.” Id. § 7(D).  \n19  Both parties detail the application and impact of H.B. 2492. Plaintiffs allege that \n20  absent such proof of citizenship as described in H.B. 2492, (1) new registrants cannot use \n21  the Federal Form to vote in presidential elections or vote by mail in elections for any \n22  office unless they provide additional documentation; (2) currently registered voters who \n23  registered using the Federal Form without proof of citizenship cannot vote in presidential \n24  elections or vote by mail for any office; and (3) approximately 200,000 Arizona voters \n25  who  never  had  to  provide  proof  of  citizenship  upon  registration  cannot  vote  in \n26  presidential elections, unless they provide additional documentation of citizenship. (See \n27  Mi Familia Vota Compl. ¶¶ 3, 43, 63.) In Defendants’ words, “if you file the Federal \n28  Form, you will be registered for congressional elections. And if, in the course of . . . \n \n- 7 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  subsequent list maintenance they discover not the absence of evidence of citizenship, but \n2  proof that you are not a citizen, you will be deregistered. [I]f you file the State Form . . . \n3  [y]ou need to provide documentary proof of citizenship or you won’t be registered.” \n4  (Hr’g Tr. at 30:14–21.) \n5   Plaintiffs  further describe that “[t]he law provides no details concerning how \n6  long-registered voters will be notified that they must provide new documents, or how \n7  they will be given an opportunity to do so.” (Mi Familia Vota Compl. ¶¶ 3, 65.) Plaintiffs \n8  also allege that there is no cutoff date in the statute by which a registration must be \n9  cancelled, meaning “nothing prevent[s] the county recorder or other election official from \n10  removing a voter from the rolls, or otherwise blocking them from voting by mail or in \n11  presidential elections, weeks or even days before an election, when it is too late for the \n12  affected  voters  to  correct  any  error.”  (Doc.  1,  22-cv-1369,  Democratic  National \n13  Committee Compl. (“DNC Compl.”) ¶ 39.)   \n14  2.   H.B. 2243 \n15  On July 6, 2022, Governor Ducey signed H.B. 2243 into law. (LUCHA Compl. \n16  ¶ 18.)  According  to  Plaintiffs,  H.B.  2243  reenforces  and  extends  several  of  the \n17  requirements  imposed  by  H.B.  2492.  Like  H.B.  2492,  H.B.  2243  provides  for \n18  cancellation of registration and investigation of registrants should they fail to meet certain \n19  requirements. (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 84 (citing H.B. 2243 § 2).) H.B. 2243 also adds \n20  verification  deadlines  for  registrants  and  mandates  that  election  officials  perform \n21  additional verification procedures. Specifically, \nWhen the County Recorder obtains information pursuant to this Section and \n22 \nconfirms  that  the  person  registered  is  not  a  United  States  citizen  .  .  . \n[b]efore  the  County  Recorder  cancels  a  registration  pursuant  to  this \n23 \nparagraph,  the  County  Recorder  shall  send  the  person  notice  by \nforwardable mail that the person’s registration will be canceled in thirty \n24 \nfive days unless the person provides satisfactory evidence of United States \ncitizenship pursuant to Section 16-166. The notice shall include a list of \n25 \ndocuments that person may provide and a postage prepaid preaddressed \nreturned  envelop.  If  the  person  registered  does  not  provide  satisfactory \n26 \nevidence  within  thirty  five  days,  the  County  Recorder  shall  cancel  the \nregistration  and  notify  the  county  attorney  and  Attorney  General  for \n27 \npossible investigation.  \n28 \nH.B. 2243 § 2(A)(10).  \n \n- 8 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs point out that not all registrants suspected of being ineligible to vote in \n2  Arizona are subject to a 35-day deadline3 to provide documentation. (See AAANHPI \n3  Compl. ¶¶ 16–18, 60.) Certain registrants suspected of lacking Arizona residency are \n4  subject to a more lenient response deadline under the statute: \nEach month the Department of Transportation shall furnish to the Secretary \n5 \nof State . . . a list of persons who the Department has been notified have \nbeen issued a driver license . . . in another state. [After receiving this list \n6 \nfrom the Secretary of State,] [t]he County Recorder shall promptly send \nnotice by forwardable mail to each person who has obtained a driver license \n7 \n.  .  .  in  another  state  and  a  postage  prepaid  preaddressed  return  form \nrequesting the person confirm by signing under penalty of perjury that the \n8 \nperson is a resident of this state and is not knowingly registered to vote in \nanother  state  .  .  .  .  If  the  person  returns  the  form  within  ninety  days \n9 \nconfirming that the person is a resident of this state, the County Recorder \nshall maintain the registration in active status. If the person fails to return \n10 \nthe form within ninety days, the County Recorder shall place the person’s \nregistration in inactive status.  \n11 \nH.B. 2243 § 2(E).   \n12 \n  H.B. 2243 also mandates monthly review and potential purging of voter rolls. \n13 \nSpecifically,  \n14 \nTo the extent practicable, each month the County Recorder shall compare \n15  persons  who  are  registered  to  vote  in  that  county  and  who  the  county \nrecorder has reason to believe are not United States citizens and persons \n16  who are registered to vote without satisfactory evidence of citizenship as \nprescribed  by  Section  16-166  with  the  Systemic  Alien  Verification  for \n17  Entitlements  program  maintained  by  the  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration  Services  to  verify  the  citizenship  status  of  the  persons \n18  registered.  \n19  Id.  § 2(H).  County  Recorders  must  conduct  similar  checks  with  the  Social  Security \n20  Administration Database, Verification of Vital Events System, and “relevant city, town, \n21  county, state and federal databases to which the County Recorder has access to confirm \n22  information obtained that requires cancellation of registrations pursuant to this Section.” \n23  Id. § 2(G), (I)–(J).  \n24  Lastly,  “[a]fter  cancelling  a  registration  pursuant  to  this  Section,  the  County \n25  Recorder shall send a notice by forwardable mail informing the person that the person’s \n26 \n \n3 Plaintiffs add that Governor Ducey vetoed a previous version of H.B. 2243, expressing \n27 \nhis  concerns  that  the  previous  bill  risked  “disturb[ing]”  the  right  to  vote  “without \nsufficient  due  process.”  (See  AAANHPI  Compl.  ¶¶ 57–58.)  The  previous  bill  gave \n28 \nindividuals suspected of lacking United States citizenship 90 days to provide DPOC. (Id. \n¶ 60.) H.B. 2243, as enacted, reduced that response period to 35 days. (Id.)  \n \n- 9 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  registration has been cancelled, the reason for cancellation, the qualifications of electors \n2  pursuant to Section 16-101 and instructions on registering to vote . . . .” Id. § 2(K).    \n3  C.  Legality of the Voting Laws   \n4  Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws are illegal in multiple respects.  \n5  1.  Preemption Under Inter Tribal Council  \n6  Plaintiffs allege that “[i]n essence, H.B. 2492 creates three distinct voter rolls in \n7  Arizona—one for all local, state, and federal elections, one for U.S. House and Senate \n8  elections, and one for Presidential elections.” (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 72.) Under Inter \n9  Tribal Council, as interpreted by Plaintiffs, the NVRA preempts Arizona’s requirement \n10  that Federal Form users provide DPOC in order to vote for President. (E.g. Mi Familia \n11  Vota Compl. ¶¶ 97–99.) The United States details that during legislative hearings on H.B. \n12  2492, legislative counsel warned that the NVRA would preempt the statute’s DPOC \n13  requirement for Federal Form users. (USA Compl. ¶ 45 (referencing Inter Tribal Council, \n14  570 U.S. at 20).) House Speaker Pro Tempore Travis Grantham responded that defending \n15  H.B. 2492 would be a “fight worth having” in court. (Id. ¶ 46; LUCHA Compl. ¶ 209.)  \n16  2.  Arbitrary & Discriminatory Verification of Citizenship   \n17  Plaintiffs also contend that the citizenship verification requirements in the Voting \n18  Laws threaten to illegally disenfranchise thousands of Arizonans.  \n19  After  attempting  to  verify  a  registrant’s  citizenship,  County  Recorders  must \n20  “cancel a registration . . . when the [Recorder] receives and confirms information that the \n21  person registered is not a United States citizen,” but the statute does not define what \n22  “confirms information” means in this context. (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 82.) Plaintiffs add \n23  that the databases used to “confirm” citizenship are “outdated and inaccurate,” which \n24  subjects  naturalized  citizens  who  might  erroneously  appear  in  those  databases  to \n25  disproportionate scrutiny.4 (Id. ¶¶ 73, 86; Poder Latinx Compl. ¶ 127.) Plaintiffs allege on \n26 \n \n4 Plaintiffs posit that the DPOC requirement “disproportionately affect[s] . . . not only \n27 \nArizona voters who are naturalized citizens . . . but also those who are racial minorities, \nelderly,  or  recently  turned  18  years  old,  because  the  law  singles  out  for  disparate \n28 \ntreatment ‘federal only’ voters, who disproportionately have these characteristics.” (DNC \nCompl. ¶ 40.) \n \n- 10 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  information and belief that the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements database \n2  only contains information on naturalized and derived citizens, not citizens born in the \n3  United States. (Poder Latinx Compl. ¶ 53.) Compounding the alleged risk of arbitrary and \n4  inaccurate enforcement of the verification requirements, “[certain] of these databases \n5  were [not] designed to capture or reflect current citizenship status.” (DNC Compl. ¶¶ 36–\n6  37.) Plaintiffs relatedly allege that H.B. 2243’s “reason to believe” investigation criterion \n7  “essentially allows anyone, without evidence, to simply give a list of names of people \n8  who are purportedly not citizens to the county recorders, thus triggering a check that can \n9  lead  to  improperly  cancelled  voter  registrations  and  potential  investigation  and \n10  prosecution of eligible and registered Arizonans.” (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 86.)  \n11  Further, Plaintiffs assert that the Voting Laws intentionally target protected groups \n12  for investigation, registration cancellation, and prosecution. “AANHPIs and other ethnic \n13  groups. . . are disproportionately likely to lack the forms of identification required under \n14  H.B. 2492 and H.B. 2243 to register to vote and remain on the voter rolls.” (Id. ¶ 90.) \n15  And because AANHPIs and Latinos “comprise a large proportion of naturalized citizens \n16  in Arizona and the population of AANHPIs and other ethnic groups in Arizona is rapidly \n17  increasing,  the  birthplace,  DPOC,  and  DPOR  requirements  imposed  by  [the  Voting \n18  Laws] on naturalized citizens has a disproportionate impact” on these protected groups. \n19  (See id. ¶ 91 (11,000 Arizona residents naturalized each year between 2014 and 2020, \n20  with  the  largest  proportion  from  Mexico,  followed  by  “Asiatic  countries”);  LUCHA \n21  Compl. ¶ 156 (Voting Laws burden “eligible Latino and language minority voters”).) To \n22  support their claim that this disparate impact is deliberate, Plaintiffs point to the allegedly \n23  unsubstantiated statements of Representative Jake Hoffman, H.B. 2492’s sponsor, that \n24  Arizona’s elections are compromised by fraud and count the votes of “non-U.S. citizen \n25  voters.” (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 201–02.) Plaintiffs also allege that H.B. 2243’s criterion for \n26  enhanced scrutiny of a registrant—“reason to believe” that a registrant is not a United \n27  States citizen—invites racial and national origin discrimination. (Poder Latinx Compl. \n28  ¶¶ 7, 41; see AAANHPI Compl. ¶¶ 85–86, 88.)  \n \n- 11 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  3.  Discriminatory Affirmation of Citizenship  \n2  Plaintiffs also take issue with the Check Box and Birthplace Requirements. (E.g. \n3  LUCHA  Compl.  ¶ 273;  USA  Compl.  ¶¶  57–61.)  The  United  States  alleges  that  by \n4  requiring election officials to reject a registration form without the requisite check mark \n5  when an applicant has already affirmed citizenship under penalty of perjury and provided \n6  DPOC, H.B. 2492 denies “qualified individuals the right to vote” based on an immaterial \n7  “technical[ity].” (USA Compl. ¶¶ 57–61.) Private Plaintiffs allege “on information and \n8  belief, the birthplace requirement will only be used to identify naturalized citizens for \n9  differential, unequal treatment by the state and will act to chill voter registration of \n10  AANHPIs, naturalized citizens, and other voters of color in a disproportionate manner.” \n11  (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 94.) Relatedly, Plaintiffs contend that such added complexities of \n12  properly registering to vote risk disenfranchising “language minority” groups in Arizona, \n13  including Arizona’s naturalized Latino population. (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 186–91.) \n14  4.  Discriminatory Documentary Proof of Residence  \n15  Plaintiffs assert that “because many residences on Indian reservations in Arizona \n16  lack a numbered street address or residential address, many enrolled members of tribes \n17  are likely to be prevented from voting by the DPOR requirement.” (Id. ¶ 29.) Indeed, \n18  Plaintiff San Carlos Apache Tribe alleges that on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, \n19  “many residences are not assigned a physical numbered street address. Instead, members \n20  of the Tribe commonly describe where they live using . . . mile markers on Route 70, \n21  Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Indian Routes, or other landmarks and distances.” (Id. ¶ 32.) \n22  The Tribe’s members often lack documents bearing their name and residential address \n23  and will be unable to satisfy H.B. 2492’s DPOR requirement. (Id. ¶ 35.) Plaintiffs add \n24  that the “experience for citizens of the San Carlos Apache is also the norm for many other \n25  Tribal citizens residing on the reservations of . . . other . . . Tribes in Arizona.”5 (Id. ¶ 38.) \n \n26  5 In addition to specific protected groups that risk disenfranchisement under the Voting \nLaws, Plaintiffs claim that the DPOR requirement will prevent other Arizonans from \n27 \nvoting. For example, students living and eligible to vote in Arizona often carry out of \nstate drivers’ licenses and cannot pay to obtain an additional Arizona state identification. \n28 \n(LUCHA  Compl.  ¶  241.)  These  would-be  voters  will  be  unable  to  meet  the  DPOR \nrequirement. (Id.) \n \n- 12 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  The DPOR requirement will consequently “burden a substantial portion of the Native \n2  population in Arizona, and this burden will be unique when compared to other eligible \n3  Arizona voters.”6 (Id. ¶ 139.)  \n4  5.  The Parties’ Interests  \n5  Plaintiffs  claim  that  Arizona  has  no  legitimate  reason  for  the  Birthplace \n6  Requirement when individuals must already provide DPOC to vote in state elections, and \n7  such unnecessary emphasis on national origin evidences the discriminatory intent behind \n8  the Birthplace Requirement. (See AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 94.) Relatedly, Plaintiffs argue \n9  that  there  is  “no  evidence  of  widespread  voter  fraud  or  non-U.S.  citizen  voting  in \n10  Arizona.” (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 198–99.) Arizona cannot, according to Plaintiffs, identify \n11  even a rational state interest served by “the DPOC requirement, Birthplace Requirement, \n12  Checkmark Requirement, or the mandated use of outdated and incorrect citizenship data \n13  to reject voter registration applications and purge eligible voters from the rolls.” (Id. \n14  ¶ 197; see USA Compl. ¶¶ 49, 53–54.) Plaintiffs forecast that “the restrictions imposed \n15  by HB 2492 and HB 2243 will not enhance electoral security. Instead, they will make \n16  voter  registration  rolls  less  reliable,  and  will  undermine  the  public’s  confidence  in \n17  Arizona’s elections.” (LUCHA Compl. ¶ 204.)  \n18  All Plaintiffs have asserted interests against the enforcement of the Voting Laws. \n19  Specifically, several Private Plaintiffs allege that implementation of the Voting Laws will \n20  harm both the entities and their respective constituents. (See, e.g., AAANHPI Compl. \n21  ¶¶ 101–12.) These Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws have forced and will force them \n22  to  divert  organizational  resources  to  “train  [their]  staff  and  volunteers  on  the  new \n23  regulations and educate potential voters, who often have limited English proficiency, on \n24  the additional documentation required to register to vote.” (Id. ¶¶ 101–02.) Without the \n25  alleged barriers to voting imposed by the Voting Laws, “Plaintiff[s] would have the \n26  ability to use [their] limited resources in reaching out to more voters through . . . voter \n \n27  6 Plaintiffs also claim that H.B. 2492’s disproportionate impact on Native Americans is \nintentional,  in  that  the  Arizona  Legislature  aims  to  repress  the  “increased  political \n28 \nmobilization by Native voters” seen in the 2020 presidential election. (LUCHA Compl. \n¶¶ 149–50.)   \n \n- 13 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  registration, mobilization, and participation efforts.” (Id. ¶ 102.) Further, certain Private \n2  Plaintiffs assert that the Voting Laws will diminish the impact of their work, as some of \n3  their  constituents  will  be  removed  from  voter  rolls  and  deterred  from  voting  or \n4  registering. (Id. ¶¶ 101–05, 112.) \n5  As for Defendants, they assert that the Voting Laws advance Arizona’s interest in \n6  “reducing  administrative  burdens,”  “securing  its  elections,”  and  “maintaining  voter \n7  confidence.” (Mot. at 16.)  \n8  D.  Procedural History   \n9  On March 31, 2022, Mi Familia Vota Plaintiffs7 filed their Complaint in this \n10  Court. (Doc. 1, 03/31/2022 Mi Familia Vota Compl.) The United States and additional \n11  Private Plaintiffs subsequently filed lawsuits attacking the legality of the Voting Laws. \n12  These lawsuits have been consolidated into the instant case. (E.g. Doc. 164, 11/10/2022 \n13  Order re: Consolidation.) All Plaintiffs make at least one of the following claims: the \n14  Voting Laws (1) place an undue burden on the right to vote, violating the First and \n15  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States  Constitution;  (2)  enable  arbitrary  and \n16  disparate treatment of voters, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \n17  Amendment (“Equal Protection Clause”); (3) enable national origin discrimination in \n18  violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; (4) discriminate based on race, violating the \n19  Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments; (5) deprive procedural due process (6) violate \n20  § 10101 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (7) violate Sections 5, 6, and 8 of the NVRA; \n21  and (8) violate the Voting Rights Act.    \n22  On September 16, 2022, Defendants8 filed the Motion, to which Plaintiffs filed \n23  their Oppositions on October 17, 2022. (Mot.; Doc. 150, Mi Familia Opp’n; Doc. 151, \n24  Democratic National Committee Opp’n (“DNC Opp’n”); Doc. 152, United States Opp’n; \n25  Doc. 153, Living United for Change in Arizona Opp’n (“LUCHA Opp’n”); Doc. 154, \n \n26  7 The Court references organizational Plaintiffs that have filed collectively under the \nname  of  one  organization.  “LUCHA  Plaintiffs,”  for  example,  includes  all  additional \n27 \nPlaintiffs that are named on the briefing with LUCHA.  \n8 Plaintiffs also sued the Arizona Secretary of State and all Arizona County Recorders in \n28 \ntheir official capacities. (E.g., Mi Familia Vota Compl. ¶¶ 22, 24–39.) These Defendants \ndid not join the Motion. (See Mot.)  \n \n- 14 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Poder Latinx Opp’n; Doc. 89, 22-cv-1381, AAANHPI Opp’n.) Defendants filed their \n2  Consolidated Reply on November 23, 2022. (Doc. 180, Reply.) The Court held oral \n3  argument on the Motion on December 15, 2022. (Doc. 187, Min. Entry.)   \n4  II.  LEGAL STANDARDS & ANALYSIS  \n5  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue  and bring unripe claims. \n6  (Mot. at 9–13.) Defendants alternatively argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state claims \n7  that the Voting Laws are unlawful. (Id. at 14–30.) The Court addresses each argument in \n8  turn. \n9  A.  Rule 12(b)(1)  \n10  Rule  12(b)(1)  allows  parties  to  move  to  dismiss  for  lack  of  subject  matter \n11  jurisdiction. As  courts of limited jurisdiction, federal  courts  may only hear cases as \n12  permitted by Congress and the U.S. Constitution. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. \n13  Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). Federal jurisdiction is therefore presumed absent until the \n14  claimant demonstrates otherwise. Id. “A Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack may be facial \n15  or factual.” Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004). A facial \n16  attack “assert[s] that the allegations contained in a complaint are insufficient on their face \n17  to invoke federal jurisdiction.” Id. The court accepts the plaintiff’s allegations as true and \n18  draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, \n19  1121 (9th Cir. 2014). From there,  the court “determines whether the allegations are \n20  sufficient  as  a  legal  matter  to  invoke  the  court’s  jurisdiction.”  Id.  A  factual  attack \n21  challenges  the  underlying  factual  allegations  by  introducing  evidence  beyond  the \n22  pleadings. Id. In either instance, the party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden of proof. \n23  Indus. Tectonics, Inc. v. Aero Alloy, 912 F.2d 1090, 1092 (9th Cir. 1990). \n24  1.  Standing  \n25  Under  Article  III  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  a  plaintiff  does  not  have \n26  standing unless it can show (1) an “injury in fact” that is concrete and particularized and \n27  actual  or  imminent,  not  hypothetical;  (2)  that  the  injury  is  fairly  traceable  to  the \n28  challenged  action  of  the  defendant;  and  (3)  that  it  is  likely,  as  opposed  to  merely \n \n- 15 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. See Lujan v. Defs. of \n2  Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (cleaned up). “At the pleading stage, general \n3  factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice[.]” Id. at \n4  561. In cases for prospective injunctive relief, “past wrongs do not in themselves amount \n5  to that real and immediate threat of injury necessary to make out a case or controversy.” \n6  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 (1983). Rather, a plaintiff’s “standing to \n7  seek the injunction requested depend[s] on whether he [is] likely to suffer future injury.” \n8  Id. at 105. When addressing behavior that is alleged to increase the risk of future injury, \n9  the future injury must be “certainly impending.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, 568 U.S. 398, \n10  409 (2013). Plaintiffs must establish standing “for each claim for relief.” Little Sisters of \n11  the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367, 2379 n.6 (2020).   \n12   “[A]n  organization  has  direct  standing  to  sue  where  it  establishes  that  the \n13  defendant’s  behavior  has  frustrated  its  mission  and  caused  it  to  divert  resources  in \n14  response to that frustration of purpose.” E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d \n15  640, 663 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Fair Hous. of Marin v. Combs, 285 F.3d 899, 905 (9th \n16  Cir. 2002)). Organizations cannot “manufacture the injury by incurring litigation costs,” \n17  but they can show standing when they “would have suffered some other injury had they \n18  not diverted resources to counteracting the problem.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). \n19  And even if the diversion-of-resources injury is “broadly alleged,” such allegations are \n20  still “sufficient to establish organizational standing at the pleading stage.” Nat’l Council \n21  of  La  Raza  v.  Cegavske,  800  F.3d  1032,  1040  (9th  Cir.  2015)  (citation  omitted). \n22  Moreover, “[o]nly one plaintiff needs to have standing when only injunctive relief is \n23  sought.” DNC v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d 824, 841 (D. Ariz. 2018) (citing Crawford v. \n24  Marion Cnty. Election Bd., 472 F.3d 949, 951 (7th Cir. 2007)) (finding standing where \n25  Arizona  Democratic  Party  and  additional  private  plaintiffs  requested  injunctive  and \n26  declaratory relief against Arizona election law), aff’d sub nom. DNC v. Hobbs, 9 F.4th \n27  1218, 1219 (9th Cir. 2021) (Mem.); Mecinas v. Hobbs, 30 F.4th 890, 897 (9th Cir. 2022) \n28  (“In a suit with multiple plaintiffs, generally only one plaintiff need have standing for the \n \n- 16 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  suit to proceed.”); c.f. We Are America/Somos America, Coal. of Arizona v. Maricopa \n2  Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 809 F. Supp. 2d 1084, 1091 (D. Ariz. 2011) (district court is not \n3  “strictly prohibit[ed]”  from considering multiple plaintiffs’ standing, despite “general \n4  rule” on appeal that only one plaintiff need have standing).   \n5  Plaintiffs have standing to sue.9 Defendants concede that the United States has \n6  standing to bring its  claims. (See  Hr’g  Tr. at  6:22–7:3.) Private Plaintiffs have also \n7  established organizational standing. LUCHA Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the Voting \n8  Laws  will  force  LUCHA,  which  has  previously  conducted  voter  registration  and \n9  education activities and plans to continue these activities in the future, to “divert money, \n10  personnel, time, and resources away from other activities” as a result of the requirements \n11  imposed by the Voting Laws. (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 214–16, 223–24.) LUCHA also serves \n12  naturalized citizens, and as explained below Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that this \n13  group will be disproportionately disenfranchised under the Voting Laws. (Id. ¶¶ 211–13; \n14  infra II(B)(1)(a), (2)(a).) LUCHA anticipates not only that some its “assisted voters” will \n15  be prevented from voting by the Voting Laws’ DPOC and DPOR requirements, but also \n16  that many of the individuals it seeks to mobilize will be “intimidated and discouraged \n17  from registering to vote, even though they are eligible, because of the unconstitutional \n18  limits imposed on the exercise of their franchise by H.B. 2492 and H.B. 2243.” (LUCHA \n19  Compl. ¶¶ 218–19.) LUCHA has standing to sue. See Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d at 841 \n20  (finding standing where “the new law injures the [organizational plaintiff] by compelling \n21  [it] to devote resources to getting to the polls those of its supporters who would otherwise \n22  be discouraged by the new law from bothering to vote.” (citation omitted)). The Court \n23  need not assess whether additional Plaintiffs have standing.  \n24  2.  Ripeness  \n25  Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ claims are constitutionally and prudentially \n26  unripe. (Mot. at 12–14.) A claim is constitutionally ripe when a plaintiff’s injury is \n27 \n \n9 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims are not redressable through the instant suit, as \n28 \nPlaintiffs have not named any County Recorders as Defendants. (Mot. at 2, 11–12.) All \nArizona County Recorders are now named as Defendants in this action.  \n \n- 17 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  “definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.” Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights \n2  Comm’n,  220  F.3d  1134,  1139  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (en  banc)  (citation  omitted).  When \n3  evaluating the existence of a definite injury, courts consider whether “plaintiffs have \n4  articulated  a  concrete  plan  to  violate  the  law  in  question,  whether  the  prosecuting \n5  authorities have communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings, and \n6  the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged statute.” Id. (internal \n7  quotation marks and citation omitted). Under the last prong, “the government’s active \n8  enforcement of a statute [may] render . . . the plaintiff’s fear [of injury] . . . reasonable.” \n9  Id. at 1140. To minimize any chilling effect from  an unwarranted First Amendment \n10  restriction, the Ninth Circuit has “applied the requirements of ripeness and standing less \n11  stringently in the context of First Amendment claims.” Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 F.3d \n12  1045, 1058 (9th Cir. 2010).  \n13  Plaintiffs’ claims are constitutionally ripe. Though Plaintiffs do not per se plan to \n14  violate  the  Voting  Laws,  certain  Plaintiffs  plausibly  allege  that  their  members  risk \n15  violating the Voting Laws as an incident of inadequate access to DPOR or DPOC.10 \n16  (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 274–85.) Further, as detailed in the surrounding analysis, Plaintiffs \n17  plausibly  allege  that  enforcement  of  the  Voting  Laws  will  “imminently”  harm  their \n18  organizational missions. C.f. Protectmarriage.com-Yes on 8 v. Bowen, 752 F.3d 827, 839 \n19  (9th  Cir.  2014)  (citation  omitted)  (even  preenforcement  claim  may  be  ripe  where \n20  plaintiffs “confront a realistic danger of sustaining direct injury as a result of the statute’s \n21  operation or enforcement”); (see Poder Latinx Opp’n at 4.) And contrary to Defendants’ \n22  claims, the Court has no reason believe that the Voting Laws will not be enforced. (See \n23  Mot.  at  12–13  (“Plaintiffs  have  not  alleged  any  ‘genuine  threat  of  imminent \n24  enforcement’”).)  Plaintiffs’  injuries  are  at  least  reasonably  anticipated,  not  just \n25  hypothetical or “theoretically possible.” See Bowen, 752 F.3d at 839–40. \n26  Plaintiff’s claims are also prudentially ripe. A claim is prudentially ripe when “the \n \n27  10 AAANHPI raises that the ripeness inquiry is limited to its prudential component when \na plaintiff is not “the target of enforcement.” (AAANHPI Opp’n at 4 (citing San Luis & \n28 \nDelta-Mendoza Water Auth. v. Salazar, 638 F.3d 1163, 1173 (9th Cir. 2011)).) This only \nunderscores the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe.   \n \n- 18 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding \n2  court consideration” both weigh toward hearing the case. See Ass’n of Irritated Residents \n3  v. EPA, 10 F.4th 937, 944 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, \n4  149 (1967)). This case primarily hinges on legal issues—preemption under the NVRA, \n5  the ability of Congress to regulate presidential elections, the relative burden of Arizona’s \n6  citizenship verification requirements vis-à-vis other requirements previously evaluated by \n7  the Supreme Court—and discovery will provide any factual development necessary to \n8  fully evaluate the merits of the case. See id. (challenge prudentially ripe where issue was \n9  “purely [a] legal question”); (Poder Latinx Opp’n at 4–6). Moreover, delaying review \n10  until after certain Plaintiffs have already been unlawfully removed from Arizona’s voting \n11  rolls and prevented from voting would make any review “too late to redress the injuries \n12  suffered by [Plaintiffs’] members.” Ass’n of Irritated Residents, 10 F.4th at 944. The \n13  Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe for review.  \n14  B.  Rule 12(b)(6)  \n15  A Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim can be based on either (1) a \n16  lack of cognizable legal theory or (2) insufficient facts to support a cognizable legal \n17  claim.  Conservation  Force  v.  Salazar,  646  F.3d  1240,  1242  (9th  Cir.  2011).  In \n18  determining whether an asserted claim can be sustained, “[a]ll of the facts alleged in the \n19  complaint are presumed true, and the pleadings are construed in the light most favorable \n20  to the nonmoving party.” Bates v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., 694 F.3d 1076, \n21  1080 (9th Cir. 2012). At this early stage of the litigation, the standard does not mandate \n22  that “plaintiff’s explanation . . . be true or even probable.” Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, \n23  1216–17 (9th Cir. 2011). However, “for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the \n24  nonconclusory ‘factual content,’ and reasonable inferences from that content, must be \n25  plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief.” Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., \n26  572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). \n27  In other words, the complaint must contain enough factual content “to raise a reasonable \n28  expectation that discovery will reveal evidence” of the claim. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n \n- 19 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007). \n2  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that the Voting \n3  Laws are unlawful under either constitutional or statutory frameworks. (Mot. at 14–30.)  \n4  1.  Anderson-Burdick Claims \n5  Under the Anderson-Burdick framework, courts evaluate the validity of an election \n6  law by balancing the burden the law places on the fundamental right to vote against the \n7  state interests served by the law. See Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983). \n8  Specifically, courts must “consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to \n9  the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to \n10  vindicate”;  “identify  and  evaluate  the  precise  interests  put  forward  by  the  [s]tate  as \n11  justifications for the burden imposed by its rule”; “determine the legitimacy and strength \n12  of each of those interests”; and “consider the extent to which those interests make it \n13  necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Id. \n14  “[T]he severity of the burden the election law imposes on the plaintiff’s rights \n15  dictates the level of scrutiny applied by the court.” Nader v. Brewer, 531 F.3d 1028, 1034 \n16  (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992)).  “Regulations \n17  imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs’ rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a \n18  compelling state interest. Lesser burdens, however, trigger less exacting review, and a \n19  State’s  important  regulatory  interests  will  usually  be  enough  to  justify  reasonable, \n20  nondiscriminatory restrictions.” Pierce v. Jacobsen, 44 F.4th 853, 859–60 (9th Cir. 2022) \n21  (quoting  Timmons  v.  Twin  Cities  Area  New  Party,  520  U.S.  351,  358  (1997)).  A \n22  restriction  is  “not  severe”  when  it  is  “generally  applicable,  even-handed,  politically \n23  neutral, and . . . protect[s] the reliability and integrity of the election process.” Rubin v. \n24  City of Santa Monica, 308 F.3d 1008, 1014 (9th Cir. 2002). This balance means that \n25  voting regulations are rarely subjected to strict scrutiny. See Lemons v. Bradbury, 538 \n26  F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).  \n27  Plaintiffs assert that the Voting Laws place an undue burden on the right to vote in \n28  several ways. Defendants counter that Plaintiffs have failed to state claims under the \n \n- 20 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Anderson-Burdick doctrine because “the burdens involved [in complying with the Voting \n2  Laws] are not significant” and are “justified by the State’s compelling interests.” (Mot. at \n3  14.) The Court disagrees with Defendants. \n4  a.   Burden on Identifiable Segment of Voters  \n5  Plaintiffs make several plausible claims that the Voting Laws “place a particular \n6  burden on an identifiable segment of voters [which is] more likely to raise constitutional \n7  concerns.” Ariz. Democratic Party v. Hobbs, 18 F.4th 1179, 1190 (9th Cir. 2021) (Mem) \n8  (“Hobbs III”) (citing Anderson, 460 U.S. at 792). For example, the San Carlos Apache \n9  Tribe alleges that a significant number of its 11,000 members in Arizona “are likely to be \n10  unable to obtain [DPOR], as required by H.B. 2492, either because their residence lacks a \n11  numbered street address entirely, or because they are not officially listed as a resident of \n12  the home where they stay.” (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 284, 312; LUCHA Opp’n at 2–4.) The \n13  alleged  effect  of  the  DPOR  requirement  on  Tribal  members  “will  be  unique  when \n14  compared to other eligible Arizona voters . . . giving [Tribal members] less opportunity \n15  than  other  eligible  Arizona  voters  to  participate  in  the  political  process  and  elect \n16  representatives  of  their  choice.”  (LUCHA  Compl.  ¶¶ 137,  139;  see  also  AAANHPI \n17  Compl. ¶¶ 117–18 (Voting Laws’ DPOC requirement and verification particularly burden \n18  “AANHPIs, naturalized citizens, and other voters of color.”); Mi Familia Vota Compl. \n19  ¶ 79.) Plaintiffs additionally allege that the Voting Laws undermine public confidence in \n20  Arizona’s elections and draw upon legislative history to claim that the Voting Laws were \n21  intended to discriminate against certain protected groups. (E.g., LUCHA Compl. ¶ 326; \n22  AAANHPI Compl. ¶¶ 53–54.) Relatedly, Plaintiffs allege that Arizona has no legitimate \n23  interest in the mandates underlying the Voting Laws. (AAANHPI Compl. ¶¶ 116–17; \n24  LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 195–97, 325; DNC Compl. ¶ 46.) Plaintiffs have stated a claim that \n25  the  Voting  Laws  impose  a  burden  on  the  right  to  vote  without  a  corresponding \n26  justification.  \n27  b.   Arbitrary State and Federal Form Distinction \n28  Plaintiffs also plausibly allege, both within the Anderson-Burdick framework and \n \n- 21 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  under  the  traditional  Equal  Protection  framework,11  that  H.B.  2492  arbitrarily  treats \n2  registrants  differently  depending  on  whether  they  used  the  Federal  or  State  Form. \n3  (LUCHA Opp’n at 7–8; LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 309, 313; e.g., Mi Familia Vota Compl. \n4  ¶¶ 89–90.) In other words, Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the Voting Laws are not \n5  “generally applicable.” See Rubin, 308 F.3d at 1014.  \n6  LUCHA Plaintiffs detail that the Voting Laws violate the LULAC Consent Decree \n7  and arbitrarily prevent State Form users who did not provide DPOC from voting in any \n8  election,  while  Federal  Form  users  who  did  not  provide  DPOC  may  still  vote  in \n9  congressional elections. (LUCHA Opp’n. at 8.) Federal and State Form users are not \n10  suspect  classes,  so  the  State  need  only  show  that  there  is  a  rational  basis  for \n11  discriminating against State Form users. See McDonald v. Bd. of Election Com’rs of \n12  Chicago, 394 U.S. 802, 808–09 (1969)  (“The [race- and wealth-neutral]  distinctions \n13  drawn by a challenged statute must bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state \n14  end and will be set aside as violative of the Equal Protection Clause only if based on \n15  reasons totally unrelated to the pursuit of that goal.”); Weber v. Shelley, 347 F.3d 1101, \n16  1107 n.2 (9th Cir. 2003). It is undisputed that a State Form applicant who did not provide \n17  DPOC will be barred from voting at all, whereas a Federal Form registrant will be \n18  allowed to vote in certain federal elections.  (LUCHA Opp’n at 7.) Both Federal and \n19  State  Form  users  have  affirmed  citizenship  under  penalty  of  perjury.  (Id.  at  8.) \n20  Defendants counter that requiring DPOC and DPOR from State Form users increases \n21  “confiden[ce]” that registrants “are indeed U.S. citizens and reside in the districts in \n22 \n \n11 Poder Latinx Plaintiffs similarly claim that the Voting Laws subject registrants to \n23 \n“arbitrary  and  disparate  treatment,”  but  they  rely  on  the  Equal  Protection  standard \narticulated in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104–09 (2000) to assert this claim. (Poder \n24 \nLatinx Compl. ¶¶ 120–29.) The Motion does not directly address this claim. (See Mot.; \nPoder Latinx Opp’n at 9.) Instead, Defendants generally assert that any Equal Protection \n25 \nchallenges to the Voting Laws pled outside of the  Anderson-Burdick framework are \nimproperly presented to the Court. (Mot. at 17.) However, the authority Defendants cite \n26 \nfor this assertion does not foreclose constitutional claims pled outside of the Anderson-\nBurdick framework. (See id. at 17–18 (citing Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1106 n.15 \n27 \n(9th Cir. 2011) (observing that the Supreme Court “has addressed [First Amendment, \nDue  Process,  and  Equal  Protection  claims]  collectively  using  a  single  analytic \n28 \nframework” but noting that plaintiff did not suggest separate analyses for his claims \nbeyond Anderson-Burdick)).)   \n \n- 22 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  which they intend to cast a vote.” (See Mot. at 18–19.) But Defendants do not offer any \n2  basis for preventing State Form applicants from voting at all without DPOC. (See id.)  \n3  Plaintiffs seem to disagree regarding whether this discrimination claim is analyzed \n4  under  the  Anderson-Burdick  framework.  (Compare  MFV  Opp’n  at  5–6  (analyzing \n5  disparate  treatment  of  Federal  and  State  Form  users  under  Anderson-Burdick)  with \n6  LUCHA  Opp’n  at  7  (separately  analyzing  disparate  treatment  claim).)  The  Court \n7  concludes that Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the Voting Laws arbitrarily discriminate \n8  based on use of Federal or State Forms under either framework.12 \n9  c.   Fact-Sensitive Inquiry  \n10  The  procedural  posture  of  this  case  also  weighs  against  granting  the  Motion. \n11  Plaintiffs  correctly  note  that  because  Anderson-Burdick  claims  are  particularly  fact-\n12  sensitive, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is disfavored. (LUCHA Opp’n at 4; MFV Opp’n \n13  at 2–3); see, e.g., Soltysik v. Padilla, 910 F.3d 438, 447, 450 (9th Cir. 2018) (reversing \n14  “premature” grant of dismissal, as court could not determine “without any factual record . \n15  . . [whether the state’s] justifications outweigh the constitutional burdens”); Mecinas, 30 \n16  F.4th at  905 (“[T]he  magnitude of the asserted injury  [under  Anderson-Burdick]. . . \n17  present[s] factual questions that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.”). Defendants \n18  also cite Crawford v. Marion County to argue that requiring voter identification to vote is \n19  not an undue burden as a matter of law. (See Mot. at 15–16 (citing 553 U.S. 181, 185, \n20  199 (2008)).) Plaintiffs counter not only that the law upheld in Crawford provided for \n21  alternative  ways  to  vote  without  the  requisite  identification,  but  also  that  Crawford \n22  addressed Anderson-Burdick claims on summary judgment. (LUCHA Opp’n at 4 n.6; see \n23  also AAANHPI Opp’n at 8); 553 U.S. at 185, 187, 201. Defendants have not brought any \n24  identical state laws upheld under Anderson-Burdick to the Court’s attention, nor is the \n25  Court aware of any. The Court will not dismiss Plaintiffs’ Anderson-Burdick claims.  \n26  2.  Additional Constitutional Claims  \n \n27  12 Applying a traditional Equal Protection analysis, Plaintiffs must plausibly allege that \nthere is no rational basis for Arizona’s distinction between Federal and State Form users \n28 \nvoting in federal elections. (See LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 86, 328.) Plaintiffs have met their \nburden to do so. (See LUCHA Opp’n at 8.)  \n \n- 23 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  a.  National Origin & Race Discrimination  \n2  Several Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws discriminate based on national origin \n3  and  race,  both  allegedly  violating  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.  (See,  e.g.,  LUCHA \n4  Compl. ¶¶ 329–35; AAANHPI Compl. ¶¶ 143–50.) There are two “strands of equal \n5  protection doctrine: suspect classifications and fundamental rights. The first strand bars a \n6  state from codifying a preference for one class over another, but it prescribes heightened \n7  scrutiny only where the classification is drawn from . . . race, gender, alienage, [or] \n8  national origin. The second strand bars a state from burdening a fundamental right for \n9  some  citizens  but  not  for  others.  Absent  some  such  burden,  however,  legislative \n10  distinctions merit no special scrutiny.” Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 678–79 (9th Cir. \n11  2018)  (internal  citations  omitted).  The  Court  addresses  each  alleged  constitutional \n12  violation in turn.   \n13  First, Plaintiffs allege the Voting Laws facially discriminate based on national \n14  origin.  (LUCHA  Compl.  ¶¶  100–01,  110–16.)  LUCHA  details  that  by  requiring \n15  applicants to list their place of birth and “subject[ing] voters to additional burdensome \n16  procedures to verify their eligibility to vote, as well as mandatory criminal investigation, \n17  only if they were born outside the United States,” the Voting Laws unconstitutionally \n18  discriminate against naturalized citizens. (LUCHA Opp’n at 6.) Plaintiffs have plausibly \n19  alleged a scenario where a naturalized citizen who lawfully obtained state identification \n20  in  Arizona  before  obtaining  citizenship  would  be  flagged  as  a  noncitizen  under  the \n21  verification provisions of the Voting Laws. (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 100–33.) Considering \n22  Plaintiffs’  detailed  allegations  regarding  the  unreliable  “data-matching  process” \n23  mandated by the Voting Laws, the Birthplace Requirement—particularly combined with \n24  the  Check  Box  Requirement—and  H.B.  2243’s  “reason  to  believe”  criterion  for \n25  investigating citizenship status, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the \n26  Voting Laws are facially discriminatory based on national origin. (See id. ¶¶ 113, 116; \n27  AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 87.) Alternatively, even under Anderson-Burdick, total deprivation \n28  of the opportunity to vote is a severe burden and burdening voters based on foreign \n \n- 24 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  national origin separately demands strict scrutiny. Short, 893 F.3d at 678–79 (applying \n2  Anderson-Burdick). Plaintiffs have stated a claim that naturalized citizens will incur such \n3  a burden solely by virtue of their birthplace.  \n4  Defendants attempt to counter Plaintiffs’ claims of national origin discrimination \n5  by arguing that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged discriminatory intent. (Mot. at 20–\n6  22.) As above explained, Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the Voting Laws are facially \n7  unconstitutional, which does not require a finding of discriminatory intent. (See LUCHA \n8  Opp’n at 6–7); Mitchell v. Washington, 818 F.3d 436, 445–46 (9th Cir. 2016) (“When the \n9  government expressly classifies persons on the bases of race or national origin . . . its \n10  action is ‘immediately suspect’. . . . A plaintiff in such a lawsuit need not make an \n11  extrinsic showing of discriminatory animus or a discriminatory effect to trigger strict \n12  scrutiny.”) (alterations in original) (citation omitted)); Walker v. Gomez, 370 F.3d 969, \n13  974 (9th Cir. 2004) (plaintiff need not prove discriminatory intent or impact when policy \n14  is suspect on its face) (citing Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 8–9 (1967)). \n15  In any event, the Court alternatively finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged \n16  discriminatory  intent  such  that  they  have  stated  a  claim  that  the  Voting  Laws  were \n17  “motivated by” a discriminatory purpose. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. \n18  Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66, 269 (1977); (AAANHPI Opp’n at 13–15). “The \n19  central inquiry in any disparate treatment claim under the Equal Protection Clause is \n20  whether an invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in some government \n21  action.” Ballou v. McElvain, 29 F.4th 413, 424 (9th Cir. 2022) (cleaned up). “‘[A]ny \n22  indication of discriminatory motive may suffice’ to allow a disparate treatment claim to \n23  survive summary judgment.” Id. (emphasis and alteration in original) (quoting Arce v. \n24  Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 978 (9th Cir. 2015)).  \nThe Supreme Court articulated the following, non-exhaustive factors that a \n25 \ncourt  should  consider  in  assessing  whether  a  defendant  acted  with \ndiscriminatory purpose: (1) the impact of the official action and whether it \n26 \nbears more heavily on one race than another; (2) the historical background \nof  the  decision;  (3)  the  specific  sequence  of  events  leading  to  the \n27 \nchallenged action; (4) the defendant’s departures from normal procedures \nor substantive conclusions; and (5) the relevant legislative or administrative \n28 \nhistory. \n \n- 25 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Arce, 973 F.3d at 977.  \n2  Plaintiffs point to the reduction in response time to provide DPOC between the \n3  previous version of H.B. 2243 (90 days) and H.B. 2243 as enacted (35 days) as evidence \n4  of the legislature’s intention to target naturalized citizens. (See AAANHPI Compl. ¶¶ 17–\n5  18,  60.)  Plaintiffs  also  raise  the  comments  made  by  H.B.  2942’s  sponsor  regarding \n6  immigrant voters, as well as the bill’s passage over advice of legislative counsel that the \n7  statute  would  be  preempted  by  the  NVRA,  as  evidence  of  discriminatory  intent  in \n8  legislation.  (Poder  Latinx  Compl.  ¶  48  (detailing  statements  from  bill  sponsors  that \n9  intention  of  the  Voting  Laws  was  to  overrule  LULAC  Consent  Decree  and  ensure \n10  noncitizens are not voting in Arizona elections).) Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the \n11  Voting Laws intentionally subject naturalized citizens to increased burdens, up to and \n12  including complete disenfranchisement, violating the Equal Protection Clause.13  \n13  Second,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  Voting  Laws  discriminate  based  on  race, \n14  violating  both  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  and  the  Fifteenth  Amendment.14  (See \n15  AAANHPI  Compl.  ¶¶  143–50;  Poder  Latinx  Compl.  ¶¶  107–18.)  The  Fifteenth \n16  Amendment establishes that “[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not \n17  be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or \n18  previous condition of servitude.” U.S. Const. amend XV. A plaintiff must allege “actual \n19  interference in the voting or registration processes” on account of race to state a claim for \n20  Fifteenth Amendment violation. See Skorepa v. City of Chula Vista, 723 F. Supp. 1384, \n21  1393 (S.D. Cal. 1989) (citation omitted).  \n \n22  13 Amicus curiae Immigration Reform Law Institute raises that “[d]etermining whether \ninvidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry \n23 \ninto such circumstantial and direct evidence as may be available.” (Doc. 131-1, IRLI \nAmicus Br. at 15 (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266).) The fact-sensitive nature \n24 \nof invidious discrimination claims further weighs against granting the Motion.  \n14 Poder Latinx Plaintiffs correctly note that the Motion does not address their claim that \n25 \nthe Voting Laws violate the Fifteenth Amendment under Louisiana v. United States, 380 \nU.S.  145  (1965).  (Poder  Latinx  Opp’n  at  10.)  Defendants  argue  in  Reply  that  the \n26 \nunconstitutional action in Louisiana is distinguishable from the Voting Laws, in that \nLouisiana  struck  down  a  voting  requirement  administered  “without  any  controls  on \n27 \nofficial discretion, placing arbitrary power in the hands of election officials.” (Reply at 17 \nn.9.) But Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that, inter alia, H.B. 2243’s “reason to believe” \n28 \ninvestigation  criterion  similarly  gives  election  officials  “arbitrary  power”  to  purge \nregistered voters. See Louisiana, 380 U.S. at 153; (Poder Latinx Compl. ¶ 111.)  \n \n- 26 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs’  claims  survive  the  Motion.  LUCHA  Plaintiffs  describe  Arizona’s \n2  extended history of denying the franchise to Native Americans and plausibly connect this \n3  history to H.B. 2492’s DPOR requirement. (See LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 164–69, 176–77.) \n4  AAANHPI asserts that by imposing the DPOR, DPOC, and Birthplace Requirements, \n5  “and removing voters from the rolls if such information is not provided or is questioned, \n6  Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of H.B. 2492 intentionally discriminate against AANHPIs, \n7  naturalized citizens from those communities, and other voters of color, in violation of the \n8  Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.” (AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 148.) AAANHPI makes \n9  similar allegations regarding H.B. 2243. (Id. ¶ 150.) Poder Latinx asserts that H.B. 2243 \n10  is “in essence, a redeployment of [Jim Crow-era] unconstitutional registration practices \n11  involving the unfettered discretion of officials to revoke voting rights and arbitrarily \n12  allocate  the  right  to  vote,  with  particular  harm  falling  on  naturalized  voters  and,  in \n13  particular, Latinx voters throughout Arizona.” (Poder Latinx Compl. ¶ 116.) The Court \n14  finds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the Voting Laws are racially discriminatory \n15  in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  \n16  b.  Procedural Due Process  \n17  Multiple  Private  Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  Voting  Laws  deny  procedural  due \n18  process.  (See,  e.g.,  AAANHPI  Compl.  ¶¶  135–41;  Poder  Latinx  Compl.  ¶¶ 133–44; \n19  Poder Latinx Opp’n at 7–9.) Defendants counter that any “freestanding” procedural due \n20  process claims are “squarely foreclosed by Ninth Circuit precedent.” (Mot. at 16–17 \n21  (citing Hobbs III, 18 F.4th at 1195).) Defendants are correct. See Hobbs III, 18 F.4th at \n22  1195 (holding that the Anderson-Burdick framework is “better suited to the context of \n23  election laws than is the more general Eldridge test”); Ariz. Democratic Party v. Hobbs, \n24  976 F.3d 1081, 1086 n.1 (9th Cir. 2020) (observing that district court likely erred in \n25  accepting “plaintiffs’ novel procedural due process argument” when Anderson-Burdick \n26  should supersede any other framework). To the extent Plaintiffs assert procedural due \n27  process claims distinct from their Anderson-Burdick claims, the Court grants the Motion \n28  as to these “freestanding” claims. However, certain Plaintiffs’ procedural due process \n \n- 27 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  claims survive the Motion, as they are included in allegations that the Voting  Laws \n2  impose an undue burden under Anderson-Burdick. (See, e.g., MFV Compl. ¶¶ 3, 62–69, \n3  79 (alleging that H.B. 2492 severely burdens the right to vote by, inter alia, threatening \n4  voters with registration cancellation and criminal investigation without adequate notice \n5  and time to respond); AAANHPI Compl. ¶ 136; AAANHPI Opp’n at 10 (explaining that \n6  its procedural due process claim is alleged within the Anderson-Burdick framework).)  \n7  3.  National Voter Registration Act  \n8  Plaintiffs allege that the Voting Laws violate multiple sections of the NVRA. The \n9  NVRA sets parameters for the federal election process and bars states “from requiring a \n10  Federal Form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself.” \n11  Inter-Tribal  Council,  570  U.S.  at  20  (striking  down  under  the  NVRA  Arizona’s \n12  requirement that Federal Form applicants submit DPOC).   \n13  As a general argument for dismissal of all Plaintiffs’ NVRA claims, Defendants \n14  assert that because the Voting Laws only regulate presidential elections rather than all \n15  federal elections, the NVRA does not apply. (See Mot. at 3, 23.) Citing Article I Section \n16  4 of the United States Constitution, Defendants argue that the NVRA “can [only] apply \n17  constitutionally  to  ‘Elections  for  Senators  and  Representatives.’”  (Id.  at  23.)  But \n18  Plaintiffs point out that there is no “carve-out” in H.B. 2243 for Federal Form users—on \n19  its face, H.B. 2243 allows election officials to purge individuals lawfully registered to \n20  vote using the Federal Form. (See AAANHPI Opp’n at 6.) And further, contrary to \n21  Defendants’ suggestions, Plaintiffs have at least plausibly alleged that the NVRA applies \n22  to presidential elections.15 C.f. Mattioda v. Bridenstine, No. 20-cv-03662-SVK, 2021 WL \n23  75665, at *18 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 8, 2021) (assuming without deciding that a claim exists, \n24  where case is on motion to dismiss and Ninth Circuit has not spoken to the issue); see \n25  also Voting Rights Coal. v. Wilson, 60 F.3d 1411, 1414 (9th Cir. 1995) (“The broad \n26  power given to Congress over congressional elections has been extended to presidential \n27 \n \n15 The United States details the history surrounding the Elections Clause to explain why \n28 \nPresidential  elections  may  have  been  omitted  but  why  the  NVRA  still  applies  to \npresidential elections. (USA Opp’n at 8.)  \n \n- 28 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  elections”); (USA  Opp’n at 5 (“An unbroken line of precedent  confirms Congress’s \n2  power to regulate all federal elections, including those for president.”); AAANHPI Opp’n \n3  at 6 (citing Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 124 & n.6 (1970) (“It cannot be seriously \n4  contended that Congress has less power over the conduct of presidential elections than it \n5  has over congressional elections.”)), n.6 (detailing codified finding accompanying the \n6  NVRA regarding “discriminatory and unfair registration [harming] racial minorities.”).) \n7  a.   Section 5 \n8  Section 5 of the NVRA mandates that voter registration applications included with \n9  driver’s  license applications “may  only require the minimum amount of information \n10  necessary to enable State election officials to assess eligibility of the applicant . . . .”  52 \n11  U.S.C. § 20504(c)(2)(B). This “minimum” means an “an attestation that the applicant \n12  meets each such requirement [of citizenship],” with “signature of the applicant, under \n13  penalty  of  perjury.”  Id.  § 20504(c)(2)(C)(i)–(iii).  The  DNC  alleges  that  by  requiring \n14  Federal Form users to submit DPOC in order to vote in presidential elections, H.B. 2492 \n15  violates Section 5 of the NVRA. (See DNC Compl. ¶¶ 80–83.) The DNC argues that \n16  Defendants failed to address this specific claim in the Motion. (DNC Opp’n at 8.) The \n17  Court finds no indication otherwise. (See Mot.) Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the \n18  Voting Laws are preempted by Section 5 of the NVRA.   \n19  b.   Section 6  \n20  Plaintiffs  allege  that  H.B.  2492’s  DPOC  requirement  violates  the  mandate  of \n21  Section  6  of  the  NVRA  that  states  “accept  and  use”  the  Federal  Form  to  register \n22  individuals for all federal elections. See 52 U.S.C. § 20505(a); (e.g., DNC Compl. ¶¶ 70–\n23  72; DNC Opp’n at 5.)  \n24  Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Voting Laws are preempted by Section 6. \n25  (See AAANHPI Compl. ¶¶ 160, 168.) Plaintiffs argue that under Inter Tribal Council, \n26  “[f]ederal-only  voters  must  be  permitted  to  vote  in  all  federal  elections,  including \n27  presidential elections, so long as those voters submit a complete and valid Federal Form.” \n28  (USA Opp’n at 6) (emphasis in original). Like the law found preempted in Inter Tribal \n \n- 29 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Council, Plaintiffs allege that the Voting Laws require Federal Form users to provide \n2  “every additional piece of information the State requires on its state-specific form. If that \n3  is so, the Federal Form ceases to perform any meaningful function, and would be a feeble \n4  means of ‘increas[ing] the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for \n5  Federal  office.’”  Inter  Tribal  Council,  570  U.S.  at  13  (alteration  in  original)  (citing \n6  § 1973gg(b)).  Plaintiffs  have  stated  a  claim  that  the  Voting  Laws  are  preempted  by \n7  Section 6 of the NVRA.  \n8  c.   Section 8 \n9  Section  8  of  the  NVRA,  in  relevant  part,  requires  that  any  state  program  to \n10  “protect the integrity of the electoral process” by maintaining an accurate registration roll \n11  for federal elections “be uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting \n12  Rights Act of 1965” (“Uniformity Provision”). 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b)(1). It also mandates \n13  that States “complete, not later than 90 days prior to the date of a primary or general \n14  election for Federal office, any program the purpose of which is to systematically remove \n15  the  names  of  ineligible  voters  from  the  official  lists  of  eligible  voters”  (“Purge \n16  Provision”). Id. § 20507(c)(2)(A).  \n17  The DNC alleges that H.B. 2492 violates the Uniformity Provision by excluding \n18  Federal Form users who did not provide DPOC from voting by mail or in Presidential \n19  elections. (See DNC Compl. ¶¶ 73–78.) LUCHA Plaintiffs make the same allegation \n20  regarding H.B. 2492’s DPOR requirement. (LUCHA Compl. ¶¶ 356, 358; see also DNC \n21  Opp’n  at  9.)  Taking  the  allegations  in  the  Complaints  as  true,  the  Court  finds  that \n22  Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the Voting Laws violate the Uniformity Provision. (See \n23  DNC Opp’n at 9–10.) And though Defendants counter that the Voting Laws have no \n24  mandate that registrants shall continue to be purged from the rolls through the 90-period \n25  preceding an election, the Voting Laws do not qualify when election officials can and \n26  cannot purge registrants from the rolls. (See H.B. 2492 § 8; H.B. 2243 § 2; AAANHPI \n27  Compl. ¶¶ 171–72.) At this stage of litigation, the statutes’ broad directive to purge \n28  registrants, without any limit as to when this purge should cease, suffices to state a claim \n \n- 30 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  for violation of the Purge Provision. (See DNC Opp’n at 10.)  \n2  4.  Section 10101  \n3  The  Materiality  Provision  of  Section  10101  (“Materiality  Provision”)  forbids \n4  states from denying “the right of any individual to vote in any election because of an \n5  error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application, registration, or other \n6  act requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not material in determining whether \n7  such  individual  is  qualified  under  State  law  to  vote  in  such  election.”  52  U.S.C. \n8  § 10101(a)(2)(B).  The  United  States  explains  that  “[t]he  Materiality  Provision \n9  specifically covers registration.” (USA Opp’n at 4 (citing §§ 10101(a)(3)(A), (e)).) In \n10  Arizona, such qualifications are age of majority, citizenship, residency, ability to write \n11  one’s  name  or  make  one’s  mark,  and  lack  of  criminal  convictions  or  adjudications \n12  rendering the voter incapacitated.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-101. \n13  The United States argues that multiple provisions of H.B. 2492 mandate voter \n14  purges due to immaterial omissions or errors by registrants. The Birthplace Requirement, \n15  the United States asserts, is immaterial to a voter’s eligibility, as naturalized citizens are \n16  born outside of the United States and still carry the citizenship necessary to vote in \n17  Arizona. (USA Opp’n at 18–19.) Conversely, individuals born in the United States might \n18  not be American citizens, whether through foreign diplomatic parentage or expatriation. \n19  (Id.  at  19.)  Failure  to  comply  with  the  Check  Box  Requirement  would  similarly \n20  disqualify  applicants  who  have  previously  provided  DPOC  and  met  every  other \n21  requirement for verification of citizenship. (Id. at 19; USA Compl. ¶ 59.) \n22  Defendants counter that there is no private right of action under § 10101 and that, \n23  in any event, the information solicited under the Voting Laws is “material to ascertaining \n24  eligibility to vote and thus cannot run afoul of Section 10101.” (Mot. at 3, 25, 28.) \n25  Specifically, Defendants assert that a cause of action under § 1983 “is not available if \n26  Congress ‘did not intend that remedy’ for the statutory right in question.” (Id. at 25 \n27  (citing City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005)).) Defendants \n28  also argue that the Materiality Provision does not “dictate the substance of state law,” as \n \n- 31 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Congress’s concerns in the Provision “c[a]me not from discriminatory laws,” but “‘from \n2  the discriminatory application and administration of apparently nondiscriminatory laws.’” \n3  (See id. at 26 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 88914 (Nov. 20, 1963), 1964 U.S.C. § 2391, 2491).)  \n4  As this stage of litigation, the Court disagrees with Defendants. Before the passage \n5  of the Voting Laws, the state of Arizona used other methods to verify a registrant’s \n6  citizenship, suggesting that the Voting Laws’ “confirmation” measures are not necessary. \n7  (See USA Opp’n at 19; USA Compl. ¶ 49.) And the United States points out that the \n8  Materiality Provision forbids “election officials from denying the right to vote based on \n9  errors and omissions not material to voter qualifications,” “target[ing] all state conduct \n10  that denies the right to vote based on immaterial errors or omissions.” (USA Opp’n at 14) \n11  (emphasis in original). No party disputes that citizenship itself is material to a voter’s \n12  qualifications, but the United States persuasively argues that materiality may mean more \n13  than relevance in this context. (Id. at 17, 17 n.6.) The United States has plausibly alleged \n14  that H.B. 2492 requires duplicative information from registrants that is “unnecessary and \n15  therefore  not  material  to  determining  an  individual’s  qualifications  to  vote”  under \n16  Arizona law.16 See La Union del Pueblo Entero v. Abbott, 604 F. Supp. 3d 512, 542 \n17  (W.D. Tex. 2022). The United States has stated a claim that H.B. 2492 violates the \n18  Materiality Provision.17 (See USA Opp’n at 11–20.)  \n19  The Court also finds that Private Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the Voting \n20  Laws violate § 10101. Similar to the application of the NVRA to presidential elections, \n21  the Court need not decide whether there is a private right of action under § 10101 on a \n22  motion to dismiss. While the Ninth Circuit has not spoken to this issue, Plaintiffs have \n23  cited persuasive authority from within this Circuit indicating that there is such a private \n24 \n \n16 The Court agrees with the United States that the text of the Materiality Provision does \n25 \nnot indicate the Provision only concerns “ad hoc executive actions that exceed state law.” \n(USA  Opp’n  at  13–14;  see  Mot.  at  26.)  Nor  do  the  cases  Defendants  cite  for  this \n26 \nargument support their reading of the Materiality Provision.  \n17  Defendants  also  argue  that  because  Arizona  voters  may  cure  any  error  in  their \n27 \nregistrations before H.B. 2492 would mandate cancelling their registrations, H.B. 2492 \ndoes  not  run  afoul  of  § 10101.  (Mot.  at  27.)  Defendants  cite  no  authority  for  this \n28 \nassertion. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the cure provision of H.B. 2492 does not \nwarrant dismissing the § 10101 claim. (See USA Opp’n at 15–16.) \n \n- 32 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  right of action, rendering their claims at least plausible. (See AAANHPI Opp’n at 16 n.14 \n2  (citing  Davis  v.  Commonwealth  Election  Comm’n,  No.:  1–14–CV–00002,  2014  WL \n3  2111065, at *10 (D. N. Mar. I. May 20, 2014)).) While the United States addresses \n4  Private Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding H.B. 2492, Poder Latinx additionally alleges that \n5  H.B. 2243 violates § 10101(a)(2)(A), which prohibits election officials from “apply[ing] \n6  any standard, practice, or procedure different from the standards, practices, or procedures \n7  applied under such law or laws to other individuals within the same county . . . who have \n8  been found by State officials to be qualified to vote[.]” (Poder Latinx Compl. ¶¶ 100–06.) \n9  Poder Latinx has plausibly alleged that County Recorders are “instructed” to apply a \n10  different “standard, practice, or procedure” to verify the eligibility of voters suspected of \n11  being  noncitizens.  (Id.  ¶ 102.)  Only  suspected  noncitizens,  investigated  under  broad, \n12  potentially  discriminatory  criteria,  will  be  subjected  to  allegedly  unreliable  database \n13  checks and risk erroneous cancellation of their registrations. (Id. ¶ 103.)     \n14  5.  Voting Rights Act \n15  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (“Section 2”) prohibits states from enacting \n16  voting rules that “result[] in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the \n17  United States to vote on account of race or color.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). In evaluating an \n18  alleged Section 2 violation, courts must consider “the totality of circumstances” in each \n19  case and whether “the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or \n20  political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members” of a protected \n21  class “in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to \n22  participate  in  the  political  process  and  to  elect  representatives  of  their  choice.”  Id. \n23  § 10301(b). “The essence of a § 2 claim . . . is that a certain electoral law, practice, or \n24  structure  interacts with social  and historical conditions to cause an inequality  in the \n25  opportunities  of  minority  and  non-minority  voters  to  elect  their  preferred \n26  representatives.” Brnovich v. DNC, 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2333 (2021) (cleaned up). “[T]he \n27  judiciary provides the only meaningful review of legislation that may violate the Voting \n28  Rights Act.” Feldman v. Arizona Sec. of State’s Office, 843 F.3d 366, 369 (9th Cir. \n \n- 33 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  2016). \n2  When assessing a claim of discriminatory results under Section 2, courts consider \n3  the extent of any historical discrimination burdening the right to vote, the degree of \n4  racially polarized voting, and the severity with which discrimination restricts the class \n5  from voting. See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 36–37 (1986). LUCHA Plaintiffs \n6  allege that the Voting Laws disparately burden Native American, Latino, and language-\n7  minority voters by placing “barriers to registration [causing] impacted individuals to be \n8  wholly  barred  from  voting.”  (LUCHA  Compl.  ¶¶  367–69.)  For  example,  as  above \n9  detailed, LUCHA Plaintiffs assert that a disproportionate number of San Carlos Apache \n10  Tribal members will be unable to provide DPOR not because obtaining adequate proof is \n11  a “mere inconvenience,” but because many Tribal members do not live in a residence \n12  with one address recognized by the State. (Id. ¶¶ 28–40); c.f. Brnovich, 141 S. Ct. at 2338 \n13  (“Mere inconvenience cannot be enough to demonstrate a violation of [Section] 2.”) \n14  Arizona also has a history of disenfranchising Native American citizens. (Id. ¶¶ 164–69, \n15  176–77.)  LUCHA  Plaintiffs  additionally  allege  that  naturalized  citizens,  a \n16  disproportionate number of whom are members of protected racial classes, will be subject \n17  to  unwarranted  disenfranchisement  and  criminal  prosecution  due  to  the  Birthplace \n18  Requirement and the State’s use of faulty databases to verify citizenship. (Id. ¶¶ 367–70.) \n19  Defendants respond that LUCHA’s Section 2 claim does not plausibly detail any \n20  “meaningful disparate racial impacts” and “depends enormously on speculative racial \n21  disparities that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” (Mot. at 4, \n22  29  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted).)  But  Defendants’  attacks  on  the \n23  Section 2 claim depend on evaluating the merits of the claim, which the Court will not do \n24  at this stage of litigation. And Plaintiffs need not plead any “specific set of factors” to \n25  state a claim of Section 2 violation. Sixth Dist. Of African Methodist Episcopal Church v. \n26  Kemp, 574 F. Supp. 3d 1260, 1277 (N.D. Ga. 2021) (citing Brnovich, 141 S. Ct. at 2336, \n27  2340). Plaintiffs have met their burden to plausibly allege that Arizona’s voting process is \n28  not “equally open to participation” from, inter alia, Native American voters who will not \n \n- 34 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  be able to obtain DPOR. LUCHA Plaintiffs have stated a claim that the Voting Laws \n2  violate Section 2.  \n3  III.  CONCLUSION  \n4  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. Further, the \n5  Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated plausible claims for relief, apart from any alleged \n6  “freestanding” procedural due process violation.  \n7    IT IS ORDERED denying Defendants State of Arizona and the Arizona Attorney \n8  General’s Motion to Dismiss except as to Plaintiffs’ freestanding procedural due process \n9  claims (Doc. 127).  \n10   \n11    Dated this 16th day of February, 2023. \n12   \n \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 35 - ",

Equity  Coalition  has  responded  in  opposition \n16  claiming its subpoenas are narrowly tailored seeking only relevant information. \n17  While FEC brags on its website that it was responsible for the passage of the \n18  voting laws and has blog posts with titles such as “How More Illegals Started Voting \n19  in AZ Elections and How House Bill 2492 Is Going to Fix It,” this does not open \n20  non-party,  FEC  to  wide-ranging  discovery  about  all  its  internal  and  external \n21  documents  related  in  any  way  to  elections  issues  and  FEC’s  advocacy  and \n22  expenditures over many years.  Much of what is sought is irrelevant to the primary \n23  issues before the Court for trial. For example, FEC’s opinions about the legality and \n24  constitutionality of the voting laws is not relevant.  And as Equity Coalition points \n25  out, FEC doesn’t even have a lawyer on its staff. Many of the documents requested \n26  likely violate FEC’s First Amendment Rights.  See, Perry v. Schwarzengger, 591 \n27  F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2009). \n28   \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:22-cv-00509-SRB   Document 549   Filed 09/26/23   Page 3 of 3\n \n \n \n1  The public records will reflect what FEC had to say to the Arizona Legislature \n2  at  its  hearings  on  the  voting  laws  and  many  of  the  public  officials  whose \n3  communications from FEC are sought, are parties to this case and are the appropriate \n4  persons to produce those documents.   \n5  The Court agrees that most of the requests are unduly burdensome.  FEC has \n6  given an estimate of the number of hours it would take of its limited staff to comply \n7  with the subpoenas.  \n8  There are two categories of documents that should be produced, and such \n9  production  should  not  be  overly  burdensome,  or  be  violative  of  FEC’s  First \n10  Amendment Rights.  The Court will order FEC to produce the documents described \n11  in categories 1, 6 and 8. Any research or other documents in FEC’s possession that \n12  would demonstrate whether non-citizens were voting, how the voting laws would \n13  impact Arizonans eligible to vote and election outcomes, and information on the \n14  reliability and availability of the databases referenced in the voting laws are relevant.  \n15  If FEC has no such documents in any of these categories, it shall provide Equity \n16  Coalition with a Declaration under oath to that effect. \n17  IT IS ORDERED granting in part and denying in part Non-party Arizona Free \n18  Enterprise  Club’s  Motion  to  Quash  Subpoenas.

The Court conducted a 10-\n19  day bench trial, which concluded on December 19, 2023. Having considered the evidence \n20  and  the  arguments  of  counsel,  the  Court  makes  the  following  findings  of  fact  and \n21  conclusions of law. \n22  I.  FINDINGS OF FACT1 \n23    A.  Arizona Election Law Background \n24    To be qualified to vote in Arizona, a person must be a United States citizen, a \n25 \n \n1 All docket citations refer to Mi Familia Vota, 2:22-cv-00509-SRB, unless otherwise \n26 \nnoted. Portions of the Court’s findings of fact have been adopted from Plaintiffs’ and \nDefendants’  respective  Proposed  Findings  of  Fact  and  Conclusions  of  Law,  without \n27 \nseparate citation. (See Doc. 673, Pls.’ Proposed Findings of Fact; Doc. 674, Pls.’ Proposed \nConclusions of Law; Doc. 676, Defs.’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.) \n28 \nCitations  to  exhibits  or  documents  refer  to  each  exhibit’s  numbering  system  unless \notherwise indicated. Citations to the trial transcript are denoted by “Tr.”  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n1  resident of Arizona, and at least eighteen years of age. Ariz. Const. art. VII, § 2.  \n2  1.  Voter Demographics \n3    As of the 2020 Census, Arizona had a total population of 7,151,502. (Doc. 672, \n4  Plaintiffs’ Revised Request for Judicial Notice (“Pls.’ Judicial Notice”) ¶ 1.)2 The Census \n5  Bureau estimates that as of 2022, Arizona’s population was 52.9% non-Hispanic White, \n6  32.5% Hispanic or Latino, 5.5% Black or African American, 5.2% American Indian and \n7  Alaska Native, 3.9% Asian, and 0.3% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. (Id. ¶ \n8  20; Doc. 672-2, Ex. 20, at ECF-218.) The Census Bureau’s 2017 to 2021 American \n9  Community  Survey  estimates  that  Arizona’s  U.S.  citizen  voting-age  population  is \n10  5,000,102. (Pls.’ Judicial Notice ¶ 3.) Approximately 436,816 of these individuals are \n11  naturalized U.S. citizens. (Id. ¶ 5.) There are approximately 1.2 million voting-age Latino \n12  (Hispanic) citizens, 17.5% of whom are naturalized citizens. (Id. ¶ 31; see Doc. 672-4, Ex. \n13  31, at ECF-9, -19.) There are approximately 136,607 voting-age Asian-American, Native \n14  Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (“AANHPI”) citizens, 61.5% of whom are naturalized \n15  citizens. (See Doc. 672-1, Ex. 6, at ECF-37; Doc. 672-1, Ex. 7, at ECF-42.) \n16  As of July 2023, there were 4,198,726 registered voters in Arizona. (Doc. 571-1, \n17  Pls.’ Stipulated Facts (“Pls.’ Stip.”) No. 26.) This includes 19,439 active voters who have \n18  not provided documentary proof of citizenship (“DPOC”) and are registered only for \n19  federal  elections  (“Federal-Only  Voters”).  (Ex.  336.)  The  remaining  are  “Full-Ballot \n20  Voters” who may vote in Arizona’s State and federal elections. Non-Hispanic White \n21  citizens are more likely to be registered to vote than Hispanic citizens or citizens of color.3 \n22  (See Doc. 672-1, Ex. 8, at ECF-44.) Arizona’s 19,439 Federal-Only Voters represent less \n23 \n24 \n \n25  2 The Court takes notice of those facts cited from Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice, as \nthe Court finds that these facts are “not subject to reasonable dispute.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). \n26 \nThis includes data from the U.S. Census and the Census Bureau’s American Community \nSurvey (“ACS”). See Evenwell v. Abbott, 578 U.S. 54, 63–64 (2016) (referring to ACS data \n27 \nto determine compliance with one-person, one-vote rule).  \n3 Specifically, the ACS estimates that 80.1% of non-Hispanic White citizens are registered \n28 \nto vote, as compared to 79.2% of Black citizens, 70.2% of Asian citizens, and 66.8% of \nHispanic citizens. (See Doc. 672-1, Ex. 8, at ECF-44.) \n \n- 2 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  than half a percent of all the State’s registered voters. Dr. Michael McDonald4 estimated \n2  that the racial composition of the Federal-Only Voters is 53.3% non-Hispanic White and \n3  46.7% minority individuals. (Ex. 338; see McDonald Tr. 1125:20–1129:22.) According to \n4  Dr. McDonald’s estimates, approximately one-third of a of non-Hispanic White voters are \n5  Federal-Only Voters, while a little more than two-thirds of a percent of minority voters are \n6  Federal-Only Voters.5 \n7      2.  Proposition 200 and the LULAC Consent Decree  \n8    Arizona residents qualified to vote may register for elections using Arizona’s state-\n9  created registration form (“State Form”) or the form created by the United States Election \n10  Assistance Commission (“Federal Form”). See Gonzales v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 395 \n11  (9th Cir. 2012), aff’d sub nom. Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (“ITCA”), \n12  570 U.S. 1 (2013); (see generally Ex. 27, (“State Form”); Ex. 28, (“Federal Form”).) Public \n13  assistance agencies in Arizona typically use the State Form to register individuals to vote. \n14  (Petty Tr. 89:9–15.) \n15  In 2004, Arizona voters approved Proposition 200, which required individuals \n16  registering to vote to provide one of the following forms of “satisfactory evidence of \n17  citizenship,”  also  known  as  documentary  proof  of  citizenship  or  “DPOC”  (“DPOC \n18  Requirement”): \n19  1. The number of the applicant’s driver license or nonoperating identification \nlicense issued after October 1, 1996 by the department of transportation or \n20  the equivalent governmental agency of another state within the United States \nif the agency indicates on the applicant’s driver license or nonoperating \n21  identification  license  that  the  person  has  provided  satisfactory  proof  of \nUnited States citizenship.  \n22 \n \n4 Plaintiffs offered Dr. McDonald “as an [expert] on political science, voter registration, \n23 \nelection registration and quantitative methodologies.” (McDonald Tr. 1067:9–12.) The \nCourt found Dr. McDonald credible and affords his analysis considerable weight unless \n24 \notherwise noted.  \n5 Dr. McDonald applied geocoding and surname matching to estimate the percent of voters \n25 \nby  ballot-type,  race,  and  ethnicity.  (McDonald  Tr.  1125:20–1129:22.)  Using  these \nestimates,  minority  voters  comprise  28.8%  of  Arizona’s  active  registered  voters,  or \n26 \n1,199,610 voters. (See Ex. 338 (minority active registered voter population (0.231 + 0.017 \n+ 0.018 + 0.022) multiplied by 4,165,313 voters).) Minority voters comprise 46.7% of \n27 \nFederal-Only Voters, or 9,078 voters. (Id. (minority Federal-Only Voter population (0.378 \n+ 0.052 + 0.012 + 0.025) multiplied by 19,439 voters).) Only 0.76% of all minority voters \n28 \nin Arizona are registered as federal-only (9,078/1,199,610). And 0.35% of White voters \nare registered as federal-only. (Id. ((19,439 x 0.533) / (4,165,313 x 0.712)).) \n \n- 3 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1   \n2.  A  legible  photocopy  of  the  applicant’s  birth  certificate  that  verifies \n2  citizenship to the satisfaction of the county recorder.  \n \n3  3. A legible photocopy of pertinent pages of the applicant’s United States \npassport identifying the applicant and the applicant’s passport number or \n4  presentation to the county recorder of the applicant’s United States passport.  \n \n5  4. A presentation to the county recorder of the applicant’s United States \nnaturalization documents or the number of the certificate of naturalization. If \n6  only the number of the certificate of naturalization is provided, the applicant \nshall  not  be  included  in  the  registration  rolls  until  the  number  of  the \n7  certificate of naturalization is verified with the United States immigration \nand naturalization service by the county recorder.  \n8   \n5. Other documents or methods of proof that are established pursuant to the \n9  immigration reform and control act of 1986.  \n \n10  6. The applicant’s bureau of Indian affairs card number, tribal treaty card \nnumber or tribal enrollment number.  \n11 \n12  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 16-166(F). County recorders must document that a voter has submitted \n13  DPOC in the voter’s “permanent voter file” and store the voter’s DPOC for at least two \n14  years. § 16-166(J). In 2013, the United States Supreme Court held that the National Voter \n15  Registration Act (“NVRA”) preempted the DPOC Requirement as applied to persons \n16  registering to vote with the Federal Form, requiring Arizona to register Federal Form users \n17  without  DPOC  as  Federal-Only  Voters.  ITCA,  570  U.S.  at  20.  The  Supreme  Court \n18  confirmed, however, that Arizona’s State Form “may require information the Federal Form \n19  does not” and may “be used to register voters in both state and federal elections.” Id. at 12.  \n20    Following  ITCA,  Arizona  continued  to  reject  State  Forms  that  were  not \n21  accompanied by DPOC. In 2018, the Arizona Secretary of State entered into a consent \n22  decree that requires Arizona to treat Federal Form and State Form users the same when \n23  registering  applicants6  for  federal  elections  (“LULAC  Consent  Decree”).  (Ex.  24, \n24  (“LULAC Consent Decree”).)7 Specifically, the LULAC Consent Decree mandates that \n25  for any applicant who does not provide DPOC, Arizona must review the motor vehicle \n \n26  6  The  Voting  Laws  at  issue  in  this  case  refer  to  individuals  registering  to  vote  as \n“applicants,” but the Court will use the term “applicant” and “registrant” interchangeably. \n27  7 The LULAC Consent Decree was the result of a lawsuit initiated by the League of United \nLatin American Citizens of Arizona (“LULAC”), alleging that county recorders were not \n28 \nregistering State Form applicants who omitted DPOC for any elections. (See LULAC \nConsent Decree at 1–2.) \n \n- 4 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  division (“MVD”) database to check for citizenship documentation. (Id. at PX 024-8 to -\n2  10, -13 to -14.) Arizona must then register an applicant as a Full-Ballot Voter if MVD \n3  records show the applicant has provided DPOC, or as a Federal-Only Voter if MVD records \n4  show no DPOC or “foreign-type” Arizona credential on file, regardless of whether the \n5  applicant used the State Form or Federal Form. (Id.)  \n6      3.  H.B. 2492  \n7  Under House Bill 2492 § 4 and § 5, “[a] person is presumed to be properly registered \n8  to vote” only if she, among other things, provides documentary “proof of location of \n9  residence” (“DPOR Requirement”), lists her “place of birth” (“Birthplace Requirement”), \n10  and  marks  “yes”  in  the  checkbox  confirming  United  States  citizenship  (“Checkbox \n11  Requirement”).8 H.B. 2492 §§ 4–5, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022); A.R.S. § 16-\n12  121.01(A); see A.R.S. § 16-123; (see generally Ex. 1, (“H.B. 2492 Text”).) If an applicant \n13  fails to include all the information necessary to be presumed properly registered to vote, \n14  “the county recorder shall notify the applicant within ten business days of receipt of the \n15  registration form” and inform the applicant that her registration cannot be completed until \n16  the applicant supplies the missing information.9 A.R.S. § 16-134(B), see § 16-121.01(A).\n \n17  A person seeking to register as a Full-Ballot Voter must also satisfy the DPOC \n18  Requirement by providing one of the forms of DPOC enumerated in § 16-166(F).10 § 16-\n19  121.01(C); (LULAC Consent Decree at PX 024-8 to -9, -13.) For applicants who use the \n20  Federal Form and do not provide DPOC, H.B. 2492 § 4 requires that county recorders “use \n21  all available resources to verify the citizenship status of the applicant” before that applicant \n22  may be registered to vote (“Citizenship Verification Procedures”). § 16-121.01(D), (E). \n \n23  8  The  Federal  Form  does  not  include  a  space  for  applicants  to  provide  birthplace \ninformation. (See generally Federal Form.) \n24  9  The  Court  previously  ruled  that  section  6  of  the  NVRA  pre-empted  H.B.  2492’s \nrequirement that Federal Form users provide DPOR to be registered for federal elections. \n25 \n(Doc. 534, 09/14/2023 Order at 9; see H.B. 2492 Text.) The Court did not decide Plaintiffs’ \nclaims regarding whether Arizona may reject State Forms that lack DPOR. \n26  10 The Court previously ruled that Arizona must register any qualified voter who does not \ncomplete  the  Checkbox  Requirement  but  instead  satisfies  the  DPOC  Requirement. \n27 \n(09/14/2023 Order at 34.) The Court also found that Arizona must abide by the LULAC \nConsent Decree and may not reject State Forms not accompanied by DPOC if the registrant \n28 \nis otherwise found qualified to vote. (Id.; see H.B. 2492 Text at PX 001-4 to -5 (requiring \ncounty recorder to reject any State Form not accompanied by DPOC).)  \n \n- 5 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Specifically: \n[A]t  a  minimum  [the  county  recorder]  shall  compare  the  information \n2 \navailable on the application for registration with the following, provided the \ncounty has access: \n3 \n1.  The department of transportation databases of Arizona driver licenses or \nnonoperating identification licenses [(“MVD database”)]. \n4 \n \n2.  The social security administration [(“SSA”)] databases. \n5 \n \n3.  The United States citizenship and immigration services systematic alien \n6 \nverification for entitlements [(“SAVE”)] program, if practicable. \n \n7 \n4.  A national association for public health statistics and information systems \nelectronic verification of vital events system [(“NAPHSIS”)]. \n8 \n \n5.  Any other state, city, town, county or federal database and any other \n9 \ndatabase relating to voter registration to which the county recorder . . . \nhas  access,  including  an  electronic  registration  information  center \n10 \ndatabase.  \n11 \n§ 16-121.01(D) (emphasis added).11  \n12 \n  H.B. 2492 § 4 mandates different outcomes from these database searches. A county \n13 \nrecorder “shall” register as Full-Ballot Voters those registrants who the county recorder \n14 \nverifies are United States citizens and qualified to vote. § 16-121.01(E). But if the county \n15 \nrecorder “matches the applicant with information that the applicant is not a United States \n16 \ncitizen, the county recorder . . . shall reject the application, notify the applicant that the \n17 \napplication was rejected because the applicant is not a United States citizen and forward \n18 \nthe application to the county attorney and attorney general for investigation.”12 Id. H.B. \n19 \n2492 does not require county recorders to provide an applicant with an opportunity to \n20 \nsubmit DPOC before rejecting the applicant’s registration and forwarding the registration \n21 \nfor investigation. See id.  \n22 \nH.B. 2492 § 7 directs county recorders to “make available to the attorney general a \n23 \n \n11 As further discussed infra Section I(B)(1), the MVD database contains information on \n24 \nall Arizonans who possess an Arizona driver’s license or identification. The SSA database \ncontains individuals’ social security numbers. The SAVE program is a federal system used \n25 \nto retrieve immigration-related information to determine an immigrant’s eligibility for state \nand federal benefits. NAPHSIS is a nonprofit organization that collects vital records, \n26 \nincluding birth certificates.  \n12 H.B. 2492 also requires Federal Form applicants to provide DPOC to vote in presidential \n27 \nelections or by mail if the county recorder was unable to verify the registrant’s citizenship \nstatus. § 16-121.01(E). The Court ruled that section 6 of the NVRA preempts H.B. 2492’s \n28 \nDPOC Requirement for voting in presidential elections or by mail. (09/14/2023 Order at \n33; see also H.B. 2492 Text at PX 001-6 to -7.)  \n \n- 6 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  list of all individuals who are registered to vote and who have not provided [DPOC],”13 as \n2  well as the registrations forms of these voters by October 31, 2022. A.R.S. § 16-143(A). \n3  The Attorney General must then use “all available resources to verify the citizenship” of \n4  these individuals and “at a minimum” consult the same databases listed in § 16-121.01(D) \n5  (collectively, “Attorney General Referral Provision”). § 16-143(B). As of trial, neither the \n6  Secretary of State nor any county recorders had furnished these lists or registration forms \n7  to the Attorney General. (See Petty Tr. 113:20–114:1; Knuth Tr. 2122:7–8.) And without \n8  these lists or forms, the Attorney General has not investigated the citizenship status of any \n9  registered voters pursuant to the Voting Laws. (See Knuth Tr. 2124:4–6; Ex. 285.) H.B. \n10  2492 § 7 also directs the Attorney General to “prosecute individuals who are found to not \n11  be United States citizens pursuant to § 16-182.” § 16-143(D); see also A.R.S. § 16-182(A) \n12  (stating that a person who “knowingly” registers himself or another person “knowing” that \n13  the registrant is not eligible to vote is guilty of a class 6 felony).  \n14      4.  H.B. 2243 \n15  House Bill 2243 expanded upon or superseded H.B. 2492 in certain respects. H.B. \n16  2243, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022); (see generally Ex. 2, (“H.B. 2243 Text”).) \n17  Specifically, election officials must regularly consult state and federal databases to identify \n18  potential non-citizens (collectively, “List Maintenance Procedures”). For example, the \n19  Secretary of State must compare the Arizona Voter Registration Database to the MVD \n20  database each month and notify county recorders of voters who have moved residences or \n21  are not citizens. § 16-165(G). County recorders must also, “[t]o the extent practicable,” \n22  conduct monthly SAVE checks on registered voters “who the county recorder has reason \n23  to believe are not United States citizens” (“Reason to Believe Provision”) and on voters \n24  “who are registered to vote without [DPOC].” § 16-165(I). County recorders must conduct \n25  similar checks with the SSA database and NAPHSIS database. § 16-165(H), (J). Under \n26  H.B. 2243 § 2’s “Cancellation Provision,” a county recorder must then cancel a voter \n27  registration: \n \n28  13 Voters who registered before the effective date of Proposition 200 are “deemed to have \nprovided” DPOC. See § 16-166(G).  \n \n- 7 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  When the county recorder obtains information pursuant to this section and \nconfirms that the person registered is not a United States citizen, including \n2  when  the  county  recorder  receives  a  summary  report  from  the  jury \ncommissioner or jury manager pursuant to § 21-314 indicating that a person \n3  who is registered to vote has stated that the person is not a United States \ncitizen. Before the county recorder cancels a registration pursuant to this \n4  paragraph, the county recorder shall send the person notice by forwardable \nmail that the person’s registration will be canceled in thirty-five days unless \n5  the  person  provides  satisfactory  evidence  of  United  States  citizenship \npursuant to § 16-166. The notice shall include a list of documents the person \n6  may provide and a postage prepaid preaddressed return envelope. If the \nperson registered does not provide satisfactory evidence within thirty-five \n7  days, the county recorder shall cancel the registration and notify the county \nattorney and attorney general for possible investigation.  \n8 \n9  A.R.S. § 16-165(A)(10). H.B. 2243 § 2 directs county recorders to consult “relevant city, \n10  town, county, state and federal databases to which the county recorder has access to \n11  confirm information obtained that requires cancellation of registrations pursuant to this \n12  section.” § 16-165(K).   \n13  5.  Sources of Arizona Election Law Guidance \n14  The Elections Procedures Manual (“EPM”) is a set of election rules prescribed by \n15  the Arizona Secretary of State and approved by the Governor and Attorney General every \n16  two years. See A.R.S. § 16-452. The EPM is binding on county recorders and “ensure[s] \n17  election practices are consistent and efficient throughout Arizona.” McKenna v. Soto, 481 \n18  P.3d 695, 699–700 ¶¶ 20–21 (Ariz. 2021). The EPM serves a “gap-filling function” to \n19  address election matters not specifically addressed by statute. (Petty Tr. 25:3–5.) The \n20  current operative EPM was approved by the Arizona Secretary of State, Governor, and \n21  Attorney General on December 30, 2023 (“2023 EPM”). (Doc. 699, (“2023 EPM”).) \n22  Colleen Connor is Arizona’s Elections Director and oversees the elections division of the \n23  Secretary of State’s office. (Connor Tr. 305:15–19, 307:9–13.) Ms. Connor guides the \n24  development of the EPM. (Id. 307:14–25.)  \n25  The Voter Registration Advisory Committee (“VRAC”) consists of Arizona’s 15 \n26  county recorders and the Secretary of State’s office. (Petty Tr. 26:8–12.) The VRAC \n27  addresses voter registration matters not addressed by statute or the EPM. (Id. 26:13–18.) \n28  Specifically, the VRAC may unanimously approve “VRAC papers,” which act as non-\n \n- 8 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  binding guidance to maintain uniform election administration practices. (Id. 27:11–28:2.) \n2  The VRAC has not yet approved any VRAC papers to guide county recorders on the \n3  implementation of the Voting Laws.  \n4  The Court will consider the Voting Laws in the context of the 2023 EPM. Though \n5  the parties’ arguments at trial relied on the 2019 version of the EPM, the Court finds it \n6  appropriate to consider the Voting Laws based on the current and binding 2023 EPM. \n7  (Compare 2023 EPM, with Ex. 6, (“2019 EPM”).)  \n8    B.  Voter Registration and List Maintenance Procedures   \n9  The Arizona Voter Registration Database (“AVID”) is Arizona’s state-wide voter \n10  registration and election management database. (Connor Tr. 333:5–9.) Thirteen counties \n11  use AVID directly for voter registration, while Maricopa County and Pima County each \n12  operate their own voter registration databases that sync with AVID. (Id. 333:15–25.) \n13  Maricopa County’s system is referred to as “VRAS” and Pima County’s system is “Voter.” \n14  (Petty Tr. 28:7–13; Hiser Tr. 2021:8–14.) The following describes the Voting Laws’ impact \n15  on Arizona’s existing voter registration and list maintenance procedures.  \n16  1.  Databases Referenced in the Voting Laws \n17  Before the Voting Laws, Arizona retrieved information from MVD and SAVE to \n18  verify the citizenship status of voters, in addition to receiving reports of non-citizenship \n19  from juror questionnaires. (See 2019 EPM at PX 006-20 to -25, -50 to -51; LULAC \n20  Consent Decree at PX 024-8 to -10, -13.) H.B. 2492 and H.B. 2243 supplement these \n21  databases with SSA and NAPHSIS checks. §§ 16-121.01(D), 16-165(G)–(J). According to \n22  Ms. Petty, county recorders currently do not have access to NAPHSIS or the SSA database. \n23  (Petty Tr. 38:16–39:1, 68:19–69:16.) Ms. Petty also testified that the Secretary of State has \n24  not offered county recorders any guidance on what criteria to use to match voters to the \n25  databases required by the Voting Laws, nor how to address situations where multiple \n26  databases  return  conflicting  citizenship  information.  (Id.  79:18–80:10.)  The  Court \n27  addresses the utility and reliability of each database in turn. \n28   \n \n- 9 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1      i.  MVD Database \n2  MVD  issues  two  types  of  “credentials”:  Arizona  driver  licenses  and  Arizona \n3  identification cards. United States citizens and non-citizens may obtain an MVD credential, \n4  so long as an individual can show proof of “authorized presence” in the United States. \n5  (Doc. 679-1, Ex. 2, 30(b)(6) Dep. of ADOT (“ADOT Dep.”) 27:21–25, 30:18–31:8.) MVD \n6  categorizes credentials as either non-foreign or foreign based on an individual’s authorized \n7  presence status, as stated in the authorized presence documentation. (Pls.’ Stip. No. 88; Ex. \n8  231, (“MVD Credential Documents List”) at PX 231-4 (listing forms of documentation).) \n9  MVD issues non-foreign credentials to U.S. citizens, including naturalized citizens, and \n10  foreign-type credentials to non-citizens. A naturalized citizen seeking to obtain a non-\n11  foreign credential must show an official copy of their naturalization certificate. (MVD \n12  Credential Documents List at PX 231-3; ADOT Dep. 72:25–73:10.)  \n13  An “original credential” is the first issuance of a specific MVD credential, while a \n14  “duplicate credential” is a new version of an existing credential.  (Pls.’ Stip. No. 84; \n15  Jorgensen Tr. 555:22–556:4.) Credentials may be REAL ID-compliant or non-REAL ID. \n16  (Jorgensen Tr. 543:1–21 (explaining REAL ID), 553:17–22, 554:16–20 (explaining a non-\n17  travel ID or “non-TID” is a non-REAL ID); MVD Credential Documents List at PX 231-\n18  2 (listing requirements to obtain a travel ID or non-travel ID).) REAL IDs expire after eight \n19  years, whereas non-REAL IDs may not expire for more than ten years. (ADOT Dep. 60:21–\n20  61:6.) In addition, a foreign-type credential expires based on the individual’s provided \n21  foreign authorized presence documentation. (Id. 62:24–63:3; Ex. 233 at PX 233-1; Ex. 434, \n22  at PX 434-3.) For example, if a non-citizen submits a permanent resident card that is valid \n23  for five more years to show authorized presence, that individual will receive a foreign-type \n24  credential that expires when the permanent resident card expires. (See, e.g., ADOT Dep. \n25  63:4–14.) \n26  Naturalized citizens are not required to update authorized presence status with MVD \n27  when they become a citizen, meaning some citizens may still possess an unexpired foreign-\n28  type credential. (Pls.’ Stip. No. 93; Jorgensen Tr. 560:2–14.) An individual with a non-\n \n- 10 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  REAL ID, foreign-type credential is also not required to provide proof of authorized \n2  presence when they renew that credential or obtain a duplicate credential after a change to \n3  the individual’s address, name change after marriage, or losing the credential. (Jorgensen \n4  Tr. 544:2–18, 545:17–546:1, 556:5–24, 558:1–12, 559:17–560:1.) In these circumstances, \n5  MVD may possess outdated authorized presence information for naturalized citizens with \n6  a foreign-type credential. Dr. McDonald determined that 6,048 Full-Ballot Voters who \n7  provided DPOC have a foreign-type credential and would be identified as non-citizens in \n8  the MVD database. (McDonald Tr. 1088:16–1089:5.) In addition, Dr. Jesse Richman14 \n9  found that MVD records indicate that 65 Federal-Only Voters possess a foreign-type \n10  credential, with 31 of these voters receiving the credential at the same time or after \n11  registering to vote. (Richman Tr. 1927:11–15; Ex. 930, (“MVD Non-Citizen Records”).) \n12  There are also 112 Federal-Only Voters that MVD records indicate are citizens. (Richman \n13  Tr. 1915:24–1916:5.) \n14  ADOT reports an overall internal record error rate of approximately 10 to 15%. \n15  (Jorgensen Tr. 548:12–21; Pls.’ Stip. No. 115.) But an MVD representative “would have \n16  to make multiple errors” to mistakenly enter a credential applicant’s incorrect citizenship \n17  status into the MVD database. (Jorgensen Tr. 584:14–585:1.) While AVID has on at least \n18  one  occasion  experienced  system  error  when  retrieving  citizenship  information  from \n19  MVD,  the  parties’  experts  nevertheless  agree  that  Arizona’s  MVD  data  is  generally \n20  reliable. (McDonald Tr. 1189:24–1190:1; Richman Tr. 1907:2–16; see Hiser Tr. 2025:3–\n21  2027:13; Exs. 207, 220, 226 (explaining AVID mistakenly identified hundreds of voters as \n22  lacking DPOC).) The Court finds that while MVD may possess outdated citizenship \n23  information  on  some  Arizonans,  MVD  typically  obtains  and  maintains  accurate \n24  information on each Arizona credential-holder.  \n25      ii.  SAVE \n26  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) administers the SAVE \n \n27  14 Dr. Richman is a professor of political science and international studies with a focus on \nAmerican  politics  and  elections  in  addition  to  research  methodology,  modeling,  and \n28 \nsimulation. (Richman Tr. 1903:1–8.) The Court found Dr. Richman’s testimony credible \nand affords his opinions considerable weight.  \n \n- 11 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  system,  which  is  used  to  retrieve  immigration  and  citizenship  data  from  different \n2  Department of Homeland Security agencies. (Pls.’ Stip. Nos. 116–17; Doc. 679-3, Ex. 19, \n3  30(b)(6) Dep. of USCIS (“USCIS Dep.”) 25:1–16, 38:12–13.) Arizona’s county recorders \n4  and the Secretary of State access SAVE pursuant to a memorandum of agreement between \n5  the Secretary of State and USCIS (“SAVE MOA”). (Ex. 266, (“SAVE MOA”) at PX 266-\n6  2.)  The  SAVE  MOA  permits  county  recorders  to  verify  citizenship  information  of \n7  naturalized and derived U.S. citizens15 only “when they register to vote.” (Id.) Arizona \n8  currently may not use SAVE for any other purpose. (Id. at PX 266-4.) At least one state \n9  uses SAVE for “voter list maintenance.” (USCIS Dep. 170:15–171:20.) The SAVE system \n10  can only verify the citizenship status of naturalized or derived U.S. citizens by searching \n11  the individual’s immigration number16 and contains no information on native-born citizens. \n12  (Id. 27:22, 28:8–11; Pls.’ Stip. Nos. 121–122, 131.) Naturalized citizens rarely include their \n13  immigration numbers on the State Form, and the Federal Form does not include a space for \n14  registrants to provide this information. (Petty Tr. 57:15–58:1; see generally Federal Form.) \n15  USCIS considers SAVE to be generally reliable, but recognizes that data integrity \n16  issues can arise, including data entry errors. (USCIS Dep. 37:19–25, 112:5–12, 114:5–16, \n17  209:12–23.) While one or two-day delays are possible, SAVE can typically return updated \n18  naturalization records within 24 hours of an individual’s naturalization. (Id. at 37:19–25, \n19  39:20–41:4; see 2023 EPM at ECF-25 (cautioning county recorders to be aware of possible \n20  delays in SAVE when registering voters close to an election).) USCIS also explained that \n21  SAVE may not immediately return updated naturalization records if an individual is \n22  naturalized prior to a weekend or a federal holiday. (USCIS Dep. 41:1–19.) Unlike with \n23  MVD, which could possess outdated information about naturalized citizens years after \n24  naturalization, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to adduce evidence that SAVE is \n25  unreliable or contains severely inaccurate or outdated citizenship information. And to the \n \n26  15 A derived citizen is an individual born abroad who derives U.S. citizenship at birth from \na  U.S.  parent  or  automatically  acquires  U.S.  citizenship  as  a  minor  under  specific \n27 \nprovisions of U.S. naturalization law. (Ex. 274, at PX 274-1 n.1.) \n16 An immigration number is a numeric identifier from a government-issued immigration \n28 \ndocument  and  includes  an  Alien  Number,  Certificate  of  Naturalization  Number,  or \nCertificate of Citizenship Number. (Ex. 271, (“SAVE Guide”) at PX 271-13.)  \n \n- 12 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  extent that SAVE does occasionally contain temporarily outdated citizenship information \n2  following  an  individual’s  naturalization,  the  2023  EPM  adequately  informs  county \n3  recorders of how to address these circumstances.  \n4      iii.  SSA \n5  Arizona’s county recorders check SSA records to “confirm[] the registrant’s identity \n6  and help[] ensure integrity of registration rolls.” (2023 EPM at ECF-40; Petty Tr. 37:22–\n7  38:15.) County recorders may access the SSA database by conducting a “HAVA Check”17 \n8  through MVD but lack direct access to SSA records. (Petty Tr. 38:16–39:1.) According to \n9  reports in the 2000s, the error rate for data in the SSA database is approximately six percent. \n10  (McDonald Tr. 1093:6–8.) The SSA database returns “soft” record matches based on the \n11  last four digits of a social security number, meaning a SSA check could return multiple \n12  matches. (Id. 1092:16–1093:5.)  \n13  Approximately one quarter of SSA records lack citizenship information. (McDonald \n14  Tr. 1091:10–13.) An individual who was issued a social security number before obtaining \n15  U.S. citizenship has no duty to update her citizenship information with the Social Security \n16  Administration. (Pls.’ Stip. No. 150.) Setting aside these data issues, the Court finds that it \n17  is impracticable for county recorders to obtain citizenship information from the SSA \n18  database  pursuant  to  the  Voting  Laws’  Citizenship  Verification  or  List  Maintenance \n19  Procedures, as the federal government does not allow access to this information. (Petty Tr. \n20  66:19–67:5;  McDonald  Tr.  1090:13–1091:6.)  And  Plaintiffs  offered  no  evidence \n21  suggesting that Arizona could eventually access additional SSA information for these \n22  purposes. \n23      iv.  NAPHSIS \n24  NAPHSIS is a national nonprofit organization that compiles vital records, including \n25  birth certificates, for individuals born in the United States. (McDonald Tr. 1099:16–25, \n26  1100:21–1101:4.) NAPHSIS does not provide information about individuals born outside \n27 \n \n17 The Help America Vote Act (“HAVA”) requires first-time voters to prove identity before \n28 \nvoting  in  federal  elections  if  the  voter  registered  by  mail  or  through  a  third-party \nregistration drive. See 52 U.S.C. § 21083(b)(1)–(3). \n \n- 13 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  of the United States. (Richman Tr. 1941:11–21 (explaining this is a “key limitation[]” to \n2  NAPHSIS).) Arizona’s county recorders currently do not have access to NAPHSIS, nor \n3  are county recorders familiar with the database. (See, e.g., Petty Tr. 68:19–70:16.) But the \n4  evidence indicates Arizona could request access to the NAPHSIS database with relative \n5  ease. (McDonald Tr. 1101:2–4; Richman Tr. 1934:1–14.) And according to Dr. Richman, \n6  the U.S. Election Systems Commission recommends that states use NAPHSIS for election \n7  administration.  (Richman  Tr.  1914:15–1915:2.)  Plaintiffs  did  not  adduce  evidence \n8  establishing that NAPHSIS is unreliable for the purpose of determining the citizenship \n9  status of native-born citizens.   \n10      v.  Jury Summary Reports \n11    H.B. 2243 requires Arizona’s jury administrators to provide county recorders and \n12  the Secretary of State with jury summary reports that contain the prospective jurors who \n13  stated that they were not a U.S. citizen or resident of that county. See A.R.S. § 16-314(F). \n14  Matthew  Martin,  the  Jury  Administrator  for  the  Maricopa  County  Judicial  Branch, \n15  described Maricopa County’s juror selection procedures. (Ex. 970, (“Martin Decl.”) ¶ 2.) \n16  Specifically, the jury office maintains a master list of potential jurors that includes names \n17  from VRAS and MVD records. (Id. ¶¶ 6–9.) The jury office receives the full name, address, \n18  and birthdate of the individuals on each list but does not obtain citizenship information. \n19  (Id. ¶¶ 7–8.) Because non-citizens may obtain a foreign-type credential, the master list \n20  includes non-citizens from the MVD database. The jury office randomly selects individuals \n21  from the master list to issue summonses for jury duty. (Id. ¶ 9.) After receiving a jury \n22  summons, a prospective juror can inform the jury office that she is a non-citizen by \n23  submitting an online pre-screen questionnaire, or by submitting a written statement directly \n24  to the jury office. (Id. ¶¶ 12–16.)  \n25  The jury summary reports may contain only as much information as is necessary for \n26  county recorders to identify the prospective juror in the voter registration database. A.R.S. \n27  § 21-314(F); (see 2023 EPM at ECF-57 (requiring county recorders to match the individual \n28  to a registered  voter to “confirm” non-citizenship).)  Plaintiffs presented no evidence \n \n- 14 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  indicating that the jury summary reports would erroneously report jurors’ self-attestation \n2  of non-citizenship. (See Connor Tr. 393:7–394:16.) Moreover, county recorders have \n3  historically received reports of non-citizenship from juror questionnaires without issue. \n4  (Petty Tr. 104:17–105:11; see 2019 EPM at PX 006-50 to -51 (describing past use of jury \n5  questionnaires).)  \n6  H.B. 2243 also mandates the Secretary of State to inform the Legislature each \n7  quarter of the number of individuals who stated on a juror questionnaire that the individual \n8  is not a United States citizen. § 16-165(M)(3). In the first half of 2023, 1,324 individuals \n9  reported that they were not U.S. citizens. (Ex. 805, at AZSOS-563798; Ex. 806, at AZSOS-\n10  563800.) The State does not know how many of these individuals are registered to vote, \n11  nor how many misrepresented their citizenship status to avoid jury duty. (See Connor Tr. \n12  393:7–22 (recalling 11 prosecutions where persons falsely stated they were non-citizens \n13  on a juror questionnaire); Hiser Tr. 2004:4–2005:1 (recalling instances where registered \n14  voters declared themselves as non-citizens on juror questionnaires to avoid jury duty).) \n15  And in counties like Maricopa that collect prospective juror information from MVD to \n16  include  lawfully  present  non-citizens,  these  quarterly  reports  do  not  correlate  to  the \n17  incidence of non-citizens registered to vote.  \n18    2.  HAVA Checks  \n19  Election officials conduct a HAVA Check each time an individual submits a new \n20  voter registration or updates an existing voter registration. (See Morales Tr. 611:16–19, \n21  614:17–615:14; see 2023 EPM at ECF-42.) A HAVA Check compares the applicant’s \n22  voter registration in AVID to the information available in the MVD database to validate \n23  the applicant’s identity and check for DPOC. (Morales Tr. 614:17–615:6, 615:11–14; Petty \n24  Tr. 33:15–34:4.) When a voter registration is entered into AVID, the database will first \n25  compare the registration to existing records to identify duplicate registrations.18 (2023 EPM \n26 \n \n18 When the Maricopa County Recorder’s office receives a physical voter registration form, \n27 \nthe county recorder manually enters the registrant’s information into VRAS, which first \nchecks for existing records in VRAS before automatically comparing the registrant’s \n28 \ninformation to AVID. (Petty Tr. 30:8–15, 31:11–32:9; see also Pima Dep. 21:11–17, \n63:12–64:14, 66:16–67:6 (describing some of the process of using Voter).) \n \n- 15 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  at ECF-40.) Then, to conduct the HAVA Check, AVID submits a request to ADOT to \n2  return any MVD records that match the information provided on the voter registration. \n3  (Pls.’ Stip. Nos. 100, 102–104.) AVID uses matching criteria to return either a “hard” \n4  match, “soft” match, or no match with MVD records. These matching criteria include an \n5  applicant’s last name, first three characters of first name, last four digits of a social security \n6  number  (“SSN4”),  date  of  birth,  and  MVD  credential  number.  (Ex.  935,  (“MVD \n7  Verification Criteria”).) \n8  A HAVA Check returns a “soft” match in four scenarios: when AVID and MVD \n9  records match the registrant’s (1) last name, first three characters of first name, and SSN4; \n10  (2) last name, first three characters of first name, and date of birth; (3) first name, date of \n11  birth, and SSN4; or (4) MVD credential number. (Id. at AZSOS-564548; see McDonald \n12  Tr. 1082:9–1083:1.) A soft match may return up to 50 MVD records, after which county \n13  recorders exercise “some level of discretion” to determine which MVD record matches the \n14  voter registration. (Petty Tr. 36:5–37:11; Morales Tr. 611:1–4, 611:20–612:10; Jorgensen \n15  Tr. 563:5–7.) The HAVA Check returns a “hard” match when a combination of at least \n16  four of these datapoints return an exact match between AVID and the MVD database. \n17  (MVD Verification Criteria at AZSOS-564548.) AVID will “acquire” a missing MVD \n18  credential number upon a match with MVD records. (2023 EPM at ECF-40.) The HAVA \n19  Check will return no  match if the  applicant does  not possess an unexpired Arizona \n20  credential. (Petty Tr. 34:11–35:12.) In that case, the HAVA Check will compare the \n21  registrant’s information with the SSA database to verify the individual’s identity. (Id. \n22  37:22–38:5; Ex. 594; 2023 EPM at ECF-40, -42.)  \n23    3.  Verifying a Voter Registrant’s Citizenship Status \n24  County recorders use MVD and SAVE to verify the citizenship of Arizonans who \n25  provide an Arizona credential number or immigration number when registering to vote. \n26  Applicants who do not provide an Arizona credential number, immigration number, or \n27  tribal identification number must provide a physical copy of another form of DPOC to \n28  register as a Full-Ballot Voter. See generally § 16-166(F). County recorders must retain \n \n- 16 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  copies of a voter’s DPOC for two years. (2023 EPM at ECF-26; see Petty Tr. 56:4–8.) \n2      i.  MVD Records  \n3  County recorders also use the HAVA Check to verify the citizenship of applicants \n4  who provide an Arizona MVD credential number as DPOC. (2023 EPM at ECF-40; \n5  Morales Tr. 611:16–19.) AVID contains a “citizenship verified” field, which identifies \n6  whether a voter is a U.S. citizen. (See Morales Tr. 613:15–24.) If a HAVA Check returns \n7  a match from MVD, the county recorder will obtain a voter’s citizenship status as it exists \n8  in the MVD records at the time of the check. (Id. 612:23–613:3; Petty Tr. 36:15–22; Doc. \n9  622-1, Ex. A, (“County Recorder Testimony Stip.”) No. 5.) An individual’s citizenship \n10  status is automatically transmitted from MVD and into AVID’s “citizenship verified” field. \n11  (Morales Tr. 613:15–19; Petty Tr. 39:7–14.) If AVID returns a match with MVD records \n12  that indicate U.S. citizenship, AVID will code that voter’s citizenship as verified and the \n13  county recorder will register the individual as a Full-Ballot Voter. (Morales Tr. 613:20–24, \n14  617:2–7; Petty Tr. 41:7–11.)  \n15  If the HAVA Check matches the applicant with MVD records indicating that the \n16  applicant has a foreign-type credential, AVID will automatically mark the “no” box under \n17  the “citizenship verified” field. (Morales Tr. 613:25–614:3.) County recorders must then \n18  manually override the citizenship field for voters who provide a different form of DPOC. \n19  (Id. 613:25–614:3, 616:2–14; see Hiser Tr. 2019:24–2020:25 (explaining that separate \n20  DPOC “is the controlling factor” to determine citizenship when a citizen has a foreign-type \n21  credential).)  The  parties  adduced  no  evidence  of  the  rate  at  which  county  recorders \n22  erroneously override or fail to override the citizenship field for registrants with a foreign-\n23  type credential. For registrants with a foreign-type credential who do not provide a different \n24  form of DPOC, the 2023 EPM directs county recorders to indicate in the applicant’s \n25  registration file that the registrant is “not eligible” due to “invalid citizenship proof,” and \n26  notify the registrant that she must provide DPOC in order to be eligible to vote. (2023 EPM \n27  at  ECF-22;  see  Petty  Tr.  41:16–42:19  (explaining  that  a  registration  may  be  put  in \n28 \n \n- 17 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  “suspense” status for lack of DPOC).)19 Arizona’s State Form requests individuals who \n2  become a citizen after receiving a foreign-type credential to provide a different form of \n3  DPOC, such as the individual’s immigration number. (State Form at PX 027-3.) If the \n4  HAVA Check returns no match with MVD records and the applicant provides no other \n5  DPOC, the county recorder must register the individual as a Federal-Only Voter. (2023 \n6  EPM at ECF-21; Morales 617:8–13.) County recorders send these voters notice of their \n7  federal-only status and explain that the voters must provide DPOC to register for a full \n8  ballot. (2023 EPM at ECF-22.) \n9      ii.  SAVE Verification \n10  The  2023  EPM  directs  county  recorders  to  use  SAVE  to  verify  citizenship \n11  information when an applicant provides an immigration number as DPOC, including a \n12  citizenship  certificate  number,  naturalization  certificate  number,  or  alien  registration \n13  number. (Id. at ECF-23 to -24; see also Morales Tr. 616:15–24.) When a county recorder \n14  searches the SAVE system, SAVE can return a match with citizenship verified, a match \n15  with citizenship not verified, or no match. (Petty Tr. 58:2–8.) SAVE cannot conclusively \n16  “confirm” non-citizenship. (USCIS Dep. 152:19–153:6.) A SAVE match with citizenship \n17  verified establishes that the applicant is a naturalized or derived U.S. citizen, after which a \n18  county recorder will register the applicant as a Full-Ballot Voter. (2023 EPM at ECF-24; \n19  Petty Tr. 58:17–59:13.) If SAVE returns a match with citizenship not verified, the applicant \n20  must provide DPOC to be registered to vote. (2023 EPM at ECF-24.) If SAVE returns no \n21  match, the applicant will be registered as a Federal-Only Voter. (Id. at ECF-24 to -25.) In \n22  a case of citizenship not verified or no match, the SAVE MOA obligates county recorders \n23  to  initiate  additional  verification  procedures  with  SAVE  for  these  individuals  unless \n24  Arizona “has alternative processes upon which to base its decision.” (SAVE MOA at PX \n25  266-4; SAVE Guide at PX 271-10.) Arizona’s county recorders do not typically initiate the \n26  additional verification procedures, but Plaintiffs adduced no evidence that county recorders \n \n27  19 A registration is in “suspense” when a county recorder determines that additional \ninformation is necessary to confirm that the applicant is qualified to vote in Arizona, such \n28 \nas by verifying citizenship or residency. (See, e.g., Petty Tr. 42:9–15; McDonald Tr. \n1110:11–19.)  \n \n- 18 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  do not use “alternative processes” to confirm the eligibility of these registrants. (See Ex. \n2  268 (county recorders initiating 154 additional verifications of the 2502 SAVE searches \n3  requiring additional verification from 2020 to 2022).)  \n4      iii.  Verifying Citizenship without DPOC \n5  For applicants who do not provide any form of DPOC, county recorders must apply \n6  H.B. 2492’s Citizenship Verification Procedures by consulting the MVD, SAVE, SSA, and \n7  NAPHSIS  databases  to  retrieve  citizenship  information.  § 16-121.01(D).  However, \n8  because SAVE requires an immigration number, county recorders will be unable to search \n9  SAVE to verify the citizenship of registrants who do not have or provide an immigration \n10  number as DPOC in the first place. (See Petty Tr. 57:15–58:1 (testifying few naturalized \n11  citizens provide an immigration number).) Nor can county recorders retrieve citizenship \n12  information from the SSA database. In cases where county recorders are unable to conduct \n13  the relevant database searches or if a county recorder’s investigation does not match an \n14  applicant to information establishing citizenship or non-citizenship, the county recorder \n15  must register that applicant as a Federal-Only Voter. § 16-121.01(E).  \n16  The Voting Laws require county recorders to forward registrations of applicants \n17  matched to information of non-citizenship to the Attorney General, but the 2023 EPM has \n18  interpreted this provision to first require county recorders to provide applicants with an \n19  opportunity to provide DPOC. See id.; (2023 EPM at ECF-17.) Specifically, for applicants \n20  who do not provide DPOC, “[i]f the database checks affirmatively show the applicant is a \n21  non-citizen,  the  County  Recorder  must  (1)  not  register  the  applicant,  (2)  notify  the \n22  applicant, and (3) if the applicant does not timely provide DPOC in response, forward the \n23  application  to  the  County  Attorney  and  Attorney  General.”  (2023  EPM  at  ECF-27 \n24  (emphasis added); see id. at ECF-22 (describing similar process when a HAVA Check \n25  indicates the applicant possesses a foreign-type credential).) Regardless of whether the \n26  county recorder matches the applicant to evidence of non-citizenship in the MVD database \n27  or SAVE, an applicant has until “the Thursday before the next regular election” to submit \n28  DPOC and be registered to vote in that election. (Id. at ECF-22, -24.)  \n \n- 19 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Taken together, Arizona’s voter registration procedures utilize reliable methods to \n2  verify  the  citizenship  status  of  registrants.  For  registrants  who  provide  an  Arizona \n3  credential number or an immigration number, the MVD and SAVE checks will generally \n4  return accurate citizenship information. The 2023 EPM also provides registrants who \n5  county  recorders  match  to  affirmative  information  indicating  non-citizenship  with \n6  sufficient time to provide DPOC to register to vote and avoid potential investigation by the \n7  Attorney General. And registrants will be appropriately registered as Federal-Only Voters \n8  when county recorders do not identify affirmative information establishing citizenship or \n9  non-citizenship.  \n10    4.  Birthplace Information \n11    Arizona has long collected birthplace information from individuals registering to \n12  vote. See 1913 A.R.S. § 2885. Since 1979, Arizona has required the State Form to include \n13  a field for a registrant to include her “state or country of birth.” (See State Form at PX 027-\n14  1); 1979 Ariz. Laws ch. 209, § 3 (adopting A.R.S. § 16-152 to mandate the inclusion of the \n15  birthplace field on the State Form). But prior to the Voting Laws, an individual’s birthplace \n16  was not mandatory for an individual to register to vote. See, e.g., 1993 Ariz. Laws ch. 98, \n17  § 10 (adopting § 16-121.01, which specifies the minimum information required to be \n18  presumed properly registered to vote). \n19  An individual’s place of birth is not dispositive of citizenship status, as individuals \n20  born outside the U.S. may be derived or naturalized citizens. County recorders do not use \n21  birthplace  information  to  determine  an  applicant’s  eligibility  to  vote,  nor  do  county \n22  recorders need birthplace to verify an applicant’s identity. (Connor Tr. 311:22–312:17; \n23  Petty Tr. 100:21–101:9, 102:10–103:1 (explaining use in Maricopa County); Hiser Tr. \n24  2055:18–2056:8 (Pima County).) Instead, the HAVA Check matches AVID and MVD \n25  records to confirm a person’s identity for purposes of voter eligibility. (Petty Tr. 32:19–\n26  33:14, 103:2–7; see MVD Verification Criteria at AZSOS-564548 (listing first and last \n27  name, date of birth, Arizona credential number, and SSN4 as matching criteria for duplicate \n28  records).) AVID also does not use birthplace as matching criteria to match duplicate \n \n- 20 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  registrations in the MVD database. (See MVD Verification Criteria at AZSOS-564547.) \n2  However, Ms. Petty and Ms. Hiser testified that a county recorder could use birthplace to \n3  identify duplicate registrations in VRAS or Voter if an applicant has the same name and \n4  other identifying information as an existing registered voter. (Petty Tr. 132:2–8; Hiser Tr. \n5  2000:19–2002:23.)  \n6  County recorders may collect birthplace in some circumstances related to voter \n7  registration.20 Specifically, if a registrant submits a birth certificate as DPOC that lists a \n8  different name than the registrant’s current legal name but cannot provide supporting \n9  documentation verifying the different last name, the 2023 EPM instructs county recorders \n10  to accept the birth certificate as DPOC if the registrant’s first and middle names, birthplace, \n11  date of birth, and parents’ names match that on the voter registration. (2023 EPM at ECF-\n12  19.) Maricopa County may also send notices requesting additional information to process \n13  applicants’ registration forms. These notices request personal identifying information that \n14  the county recorder can use to “uniquely identify” the applicant’s registration, including \n15  the applicant’s birthplace, occupation, phone number, and father’s name or mother’s \n16  maiden name, though the county recorder will accept notices returned with incomplete \n17  information. (Ex. 85, at PX 85-1; Ex. 773, at MC 002990; Petty Tr. 168:1–12.) \n18  County recorders may also use birthplace alongside additional personal identifying \n19  information that could be used as a security question to verify a voter’s identity over the \n20  phone.21 (Petty Tr. 101:10–14, 102:1–5; Connor Tr. 390:20–391:21; Hiser Tr. 2002:21–\n21  2004:3;  2023  EPM  at  ECF-229  (verifying  birthplace  when  a  voter  calls  to  confirm \n22 \n \n20 Voters can submit a photocopy of the “pertinent pages” of a U.S. passport as DPOC, \n23 \nwhich the 2023 EPM states includes “the photo, passport number, name, nationality, date \nof birth, gender, place of birth, and signature” of the applicant. § 16-166(F)(3); (2023 EPM \n24 \nat ECF-19.) The United States requires birthplace on passport applications because it “is \nan integral part of establishing an individual’s identity. It distinguishes that individual from \n25 \nother persons with similar names and/or dates of birth, and helps identify claimants \nattempting to use another person’s identity.” (Ex. 941, at 6.) Defendants ask the Court to \n26 \ntake judicial notice of this provision of the U.S. Department of State’s Foreign Affairs \nManual.  But  the  fact  that  the  United  States  requires  birthplace  information  for  an \n27 \ninternational  travel  document  is  irrelevant  to  whether  birthplace  is  useful  to  county \nrecorders when verifying the identity of prospective voters. \n28  21 Other personal identifying information could include a voter’s date of birth or SSN4. \n(Petty Tr. 102:1–20, 166:10–167:3; Hiser 2003:20–2004:3.) \n \n- 21 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  provisional ballot status).) But birthplace alone is generally not sufficient to distinguish \n2  between voters for identity verification. (See Hiser Tr. 2056:18–2057:10, 2058:17–21.) In \n3  addition, ballot-by-mail request forms must contain a field for the voter’s “State or country \n4  of birth, or another piece of information that, if compared to the voter’s record, would \n5  confirm the voter’s identity (such as the AZDL/ID# or SSN4, father’s name, or mother’s \n6  maiden name).” (2023 EPM at ECF-70 to -71 (emphasis added)); see A.R.S. § 16-542(A) \n7  (requiring a voter to provide her birthplace “or other information” that can be used to \n8  confirm her identity). And county recorders may use birthplace when available to match \n9  deceased voters with the correct voter record and cancel registrations. (2023 EPM at ECF-\n10  52 (“A County Recorder should match as much information as possible (including first \n11  name, last name, maiden name (if applicable), year of birth, place of birth, and city or town \n12  of residence) . . . .”).)  \n13  Dr.  Eitan  Hersh22  analyzed  the  efficacy  of  birthplace  information  to  uniquely \n14  identify voters. (Hersh Tr. 647:2–12, 649:23–650:14.) Dr. Hersh noted several data issues \n15  with  the  birthplace  information  Arizona  possesses  for  currently  registered  voters. \n16  Specifically,  approximately  one-third  of  existing  voter  registrations  in  Arizona  lack \n17  birthplace information. (Id. 659:13–21.) Another 200,000 registrations list the United \n18  States  as  the  voter’s  country  of  birth.  (Id.  677:23–25.)  Moreover,  county  recorders \n19  manually enter an applicant’s birthplace (when provided) exactly as it appears on the State \n20  Form, resulting in non-uniform birthplace information for existing registered voters. (Id. \n21  651:25–652:19, 677:20–22, 678:24–679:2; Petty Tr. 99:4–25; Connor Tr. 313:21–314:15.) \n22  Some birthplace designations are unclear, such as “CA,” which could refer to either \n23  California or Canada. (Hersh Tr. 651:25–652:19.) And despite the State Form’s request \n24  that applicants include “state or country of birth,” applicants occasionally write their city \n25  or county instead, which in some cases can refer to multiple locations.23 (Id. 652:20–653:4; \n26 \n \n22 Dr. Hersh is a Professor Political Science at Tufts University with a background in U.S. \n27 \nelections and election administration. (Hersh Tr. 642:24–643:18.) The Court credits Dr. \nHersh’s testimony and affords his opinions significant weight.  \n28  23 For example, Dr. Hersh testified that “San Luis” is a city in Arizona and twelve other \ncountries. (Hersh Tr. 652:20–653:1.) \n \n- 22 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Petty Tr. 100:2–15.)  \n2  To Ms. Connor’s knowledge, county recorders are unable to confirm the accuracy \n3  of an applicant’s birthplace. (Connor Tr. 316:3–6; see Petty Tr. 103:21–104:5 (explaining \n4  Maricopa County is unable to confirm birthplace).) There is no evidence that Arizona plans \n5  to establish parameters to standardize the collection of birthplace information for new \n6  voters or to collect missing birthplace information from currently registered voters. (See \n7  generally 2023 EPM (lacking any guidance about how to collect birthplace information on \n8  a  voter  registration).)  And  despite  county  recorders’  potential  uses  of  birthplace, \n9  defendants adduced no evidence that county recorders have ever encountered challenges \n10  determining the identity or eligibility of the one-third of voters for whom Arizona lacks \n11  this information. Dr. Hersh also opined that standardized birthplace information would still \n12  not  meaningfully  help  to  identify  voters.  (Hersh  Tr.  677:20–679:7.)  Specifically,  he \n13  determined that of the nearly 4.7 million active and inactive voter records in Arizona, only \n14  2,734 records cannot be uniquely identified based on the voter’s name and date of birth.24 \n15  (Id. 658:20–659:11.) Most of these remaining records can be uniquely identified with the \n16  individual’s SSN4 or Arizona credential number. (Id. 659:13–665:12 (explaining that an \n17  ID number can confirm whether two records are for the same or two separate individuals \n18  in nearly all ambiguous cases); see Ex. 972 (illustrating possible identification scenarios).) \n19  And for those records that lack an ID number, Dr. Hersh found that birthplace alone would \n20  not sufficiently resolve the identity of two voter records. (Hersh Tr. 665:17–668:1.)  \n21  The  Court  finds  that  while  county  recorders  can  sometimes  use  birthplace  in \n22  Arizona’s voter registration process, birthplace is of little utility in nearly all cases.  \n23   \n24 \n \n24 Dr. Hersh did not use the matching criteria from the HAVA Check to conduct his \n25 \nanalysis, but instead treated registration records as identical only if the names matched \nexactly.  (Hersh  Tr.  684:12–687:14.)  By  contrast,  Dr.  McDonald  calculated  12,051 \n26 \n“instances” of indeterminate record matches from the HAVA Check’s soft matching \ncriteria, which Plaintiffs offered as evidence of the unreliability of the MVD database for \n27 \ndetermining citizenship. (McDonald Tr. 1071:14–23, 1084:12–1085:8, 1102:23–1103:1.) \nThe Court finds it unnecessary to ascertain the most likely correct figure, as these analyses \n28 \nboth indicate that county recorders would seldom have a reason to consult birthplace to \nverify a soft match and identify a voter. \n \n- 23 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  5.  Registration List Maintenance \n2  H.B. 2243 § 2’s List Maintenance Procedures require county recorders to conduct \n3  recurring  database  checks  to  verify  voters’  citizenship  status.  § 16-165(G)–(J).  And \n4  pursuant to the Cancellation Provision, county recorder must cancel a voter registration \n5  after the county recorder “obtains” and “confirms” information that the voter is a non-\n6  citizen, notifies the voter, and that voter fails to provide DPOC within 35 days. § 16-\n7  165(A)(10), (K). Except for listing various databases, the Voting Laws do not specifically \n8  describe how county recorders are to “obtain” or “confirm” information that a voter is a \n9  non-citizen, but the 2023 EPM provides some additional guidance. \n10      i.  Obtaining Information of Non-Citizenship \n11  Prior to the Voting Laws, county recorders were  required to cancel  a voter’s \n12  registration if that voter had indicated on a juror questionnaire that they were not a U.S. \n13  citizen, the county recorder did not find the voter’s DPOC on file, and the voter failed to \n14  provide DPOC within 35 days. (2019 EPM at PX 006-50 to -51.) The Voting Laws expand \n15  on this system by mandating the use of jury summary reports to cancel the registrations of \n16  all voters who attest to non-citizenship on a jury questionnaire. §§ 16-165(A)(10), 21-\n17  314(F). This is one method for county recorders to “obtain” information of non-citizenship \n18  of registered voters. (2023 EPM at ECF-57.)  \n19  Since December 2022, ADOT has furnished the Secretary of State a monthly \n20  “customer extract” file containing the authorized presence status of all individuals with an \n21  MVD credential to comply with H.B. 2243 § 2. (Pls.’ Stip. Nos. 101, 105, 107, 108, 112; \n22  Ex. 234 at PX 234-1 to -2.) H.B. 2243 § 2 directs the Secretary of State to compare the \n23  customer extract file to AVID, identify voters who MVD indicates are not U.S. citizens, \n24  and notify county recorders of these individuals.25 § 16-165(G); (see also 2023 EPM at \n25  ECF-54 (interpreting § 16-165(G) as requiring the Secretary of State to notify county \n26  recorders of individuals who are “not a United States citizen according to the [MVD] \n27 \n \n25 Though the Secretary of State has not yet used the customer extract file for any purpose, \n28 \nthe court finds it reasonable that the Secretary of State will do so to comply with the Voting \nLaws. (Jorgensen Tr. 566:24–573:19; Connor Tr. 376:6–15; Morales Tr. 622:5–623:6.) \n \n- 24 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  database”).)  The  customer  extract  marks  a  “non-citizen”  field  with  “Y”  when  an \n2  individual’s MVD records indicate that the individual possesses a foreign-type credential \n3  and leaves the field blank for individuals with a non-foreign-type credential. (Pls.’ Stip. \n4  No. 106; Ex. 234 at PX 234-1.) Because MVD records reflect only that information \n5  provided to MVD when an individual receives a new or duplicate credential, the customer \n6  extract file may contain outdated citizenship information for naturalized citizens who still \n7  possess an unexpired foreign-type credential or are awaiting SAVE verification to obtain \n8  a  new  credential.  (Jorgensen  Tr.  571:21–572:15;  ADOT  Dep.  137:20–138:15.)  And \n9  because native-born citizens cannot be issued a foreign-type credential, the Secretary of \n10  State’s use of the customer extract file to conduct monthly MVD checks will only ever \n11  misidentify naturalized citizens as non-citizens.  \n12  The 2023 EPM states that it is not currently “practicable” for county recorders to \n13  obtain information of non-citizenship from SAVE because county recorders lack access to \n14  SAVE for list maintenance purposes. (2023 EPM at ECF-24, -57); § 16-165(I). But the \n15  evidence suggests that USCIS would consider expanding Arizona’s use of SAVE under an \n16  amended or new MOA. (USCIS Dep. 59:14–23, 62:20–63:7, 70:8–23, 170:15–171:20 \n17  (explaining at least one state is authorized to use SAVE for list maintenance).) Moreover, \n18  because the Voting Laws direct county recorders to use SAVE for list maintenance, it is \n19  reasonable  that  Arizona  would  seek  authorization  for  this  purpose.26  H.B.  2243  § 2 \n20  instructs county recorders to consult SAVE each month for voters lacking DPOC and \n21  voters who the county recorder has “reason to believe” are non-citizens. § 16-165(I). The \n22  Voting Laws do not specify what constitutes a “reason to believe” and Ms. Connor testified \n23  that county recorders will likely exercise discretion to make this determination. (Connor \n24  Tr. 372:11–23.) Regardless of any county recorder discretion, only naturalized citizens will \n25  ever be subject H.B. 2243’s SAVE checks under the Reason to Believe Provision because \n \n26  26 The Voting Laws also require the Secretary of State to provide the Attorney General \naccess to SAVE to investigate voters lacking DPOC, but the SAVE MOA does not \n27 \nauthorize this sort of use. A.R.S. § 16-143(C); (USCIS Dep. 58:13–25 (explaining that the \nAttorney General’s office would need its own MOA to use SAVE); see generally SAVE \n28 \nMOA.) The Court finds it similarly probable that Arizona would seek authorization from \nUSCIS to use SAVE for investigative purposes.  \n \n- 25 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  SAVE contains no information on native-born citizens.  \n2  The  Voting  Laws  and  2023  EPM  provide  county  recorders  with  well-defined \n3  procedures by which county recorders could “obtain” information that a voter is a non-\n4  citizen. However, given the limitations of the data accessible from MVD and SAVE, the \n5  Court finds that the Voting Laws’ List Maintenance Procedures’ MVD checks and the \n6  Reason to Believe Provision’s SAVE checks will cause county recorders to “obtain” \n7  information of non-citizenship predominately for naturalized citizens. \n8      ii.  Confirming Information of Non-Citizenship \n9  If a county recorder obtains information that a voter is a non-citizen, the county \n10  recorder must “confirm” this information. § 16-165(A)(10). The county recorder “shall \n11  first verify that the person at issue is a true match to a person listed on [AVID].” (2023 \n12  EPM at ECF-57.) When there is a “true match” and AVID records indicate that the voter \n13  has  previously  provided  DPOC,  the  county  recorder  “shall  not  cancel”  the  voter’s \n14  registration. (Id.) If AVID indicates that the voter has not provided DPOC (i.e., Federal-\n15  Only Voters), county recorders must, when practicable, review databases to which the \n16  county recorder has access, and may communicate directly with the voter. (Id. (citing § 16-\n17  165(K).) If a county recorder “confirms” that a voter not a U.S. citizen, the county recorder \n18  must notify the individual by forwardable mail that the individual must provide DPOC \n19  within 35 days to avoid having her registration canceled.27 (Id.) “The notice shall include \n20  a list of documents the person may provide as DPOC and a postage prepaid pre-addressed \n21  return  envelope.”  (Id.  at  ECF-58.)  County  recorders  must  complete  any  systematic \n22  cancellation of voter registrations based upon the receipt of a jury summary report or MVD \n23  records at least 90 days before an election. (Id. at ECF-62; see 09/14/2023 Order at 34.)   \n24  Dr. McDonald opined that the 6,084 naturalized voters whose MVD records reflect \n25  outdated citizenship information could become stuck in a “loop” where MVD will flag the \n26  voter as a non-citizen after each monthly check. (McDonald Tr. 1071:24–1072:5, 1089:23–\n \n27  27 Plaintiffs offered evidence that Arizona counties provide notice letters only in English, \nSpanish, Native languages, and Braille, and that no county issues notice letters in AANHPI \n28 \nlanguages. (Petty Tr. 162:2–16.) But Plaintiffs do not claim that Arizona is failing to satisfy \nthe Voting Rights Act’s voting materials language requirements. See 52 U.S.C. § 10503.  \n \n- 26 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  1090:8.) According to Dr. McDonald, these voters must then repeatedly provide DPOC to \n2  county recorders to avoid cancellation and referral to the Attorney General. (Id. 1075:3–\n3  1077:9.) Dr. McDonald’s theory is unpersuasive considering the 2023 EPM’s directive that \n4  county recorders must first check whether the voter has previously submitted DPOC. (2023 \n5  EPM at ECF-57.) Dr. McDonald also opined that the “anomalies” in the distribution of \n6  Federal-Only Voters and voter registration cancellations and suspensions among counties \n7  “suggest”  that  county  recorders  do  not  uniformly  implement  DPOC  procedures. \n8  (McDonald  Tr.  1107:12–22,  1113:17–25.)  For  example,  Pima  County  reported  zero \n9  canceled or suspended registrations for invalid DPOC despite being the second-largest \n10  county.  (See  Ex.  334  (“Registration  Cancellation  Rates”);  Ex.  335  (“Registration \n11  Suspension Rates”).) But Dr. McDonald adduced no explanation of the cause of this \n12  discrepancy except that the Pima County Recorder registers applicants without DPOC as \n13  Federal-Only  Voters,  just  as  the  LULAC  Consent  Decree  requires.  (McDonald  Tr. \n14  1108:23–1109:6;  see  also  id.  1111:19–1112:20  (describing  Maricopa  County’s  small \n15  number of suspended registrations); Doc. 679-1, Ex. 4, 30(b)(6) Dep. of Pima County \n16  Recorder (“Pima Dep.”) 143:5–12.) These county registration cancellation, suspension, \n17  and Federal-Only Voter rates hold little persuasive value.  \n18      6.  Investigation by the Attorney General \n19  As  outlined  above,  the  Voting  Laws  require  county  recorders  to  refer  for \n20  investigation the voter registrations of all (1) Federal-Only Voters as part of the Attorney \n21  General  Referral  Provision;  (2)  applicants  who  a  county  recorder  “matches”  with \n22  information indicating non-citizenship and do not submit DPOC; and (3) registered voters \n23  who a county recorder “confirms” are non-citizens and do not submit DPOC (collectively, \n24  the “Criminal Investigation Procedures”). See §§ 16-121.01(E), 16-143(A), 165(A)(10); \n25  (2023 EPM at ECF-17, -22.) County recorders refer these registrations to their respective \n26  county attorneys in addition to the Arizona Attorney General. \n27  Bill Knuth, a lead special agent with the Attorney General’s office, investigates \n28  election integrity matters. (Knuth Tr. 2107:25–2108:11.) Mr. Knuth explained that the \n \n- 27 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Attorney  General’s  office  currently  handles  election-related  referrals  from  county \n2  recorders for further investigation on a case-by-case basis. (Id. 2124:4–16, 2130:23–\n3  2131:4.) Specifically, the Election Integrity Unit assesses referrals and determines whether \n4  allegations  of  non-citizenship  warrant  a  more  thorough  investigation.  (Id.  2134:18–\n5  2135:5.) H.B. 2492 § 7 mandates that the Attorney General’s office “use all available \n6  resources  to  verify  the  citizenship  status”  of  Federal-Only  Voters.  § 16-143(B).  At \n7  minimum, this includes consulting SAVE, the MVD and SSA databases, and any other \n8  databases to which the county recorders have access. Id.  \n9  Mr. Knuth primarily consults the MVD database and various law enforcement \n10  databases for his own investigations and testified that he can retrieve limited information \n11  from the SSA database. (Knuth Tr. 2114:4–2117:1, 2117:18–2118:10.) He was unfamiliar \n12  with SAVE. (Id. 2111:6–12.) An MVD search will yield the subject’s credential type, but \n13  neither the MVD nor SSA database provide the Attorney General’s office with direct \n14  citizenship information. (Id. 2115:12–21.) The Attorney General’s office may also speak \n15  directly to the subject of an investigation of illegal voting, but Mr. Knuth has never \n16  contacted  an  alleged  non-citizen  during  an  investigation.  (Id.  2131:5–17,  2138:19–\n17  2139:14.) Mr. Knuth testified that he would forward a case to prosecutors upon finding \n18  probable cause that a non-citizen had registered to vote or voted but he could not recall \n19  ever referring such a case for prosecution. (Id. 2132:13–2133:2, 2133:17–2134:3.)  \n20  C.  State Interests in Enacting the Voting Laws \n21    The State offers two purported interests in the Voting Laws: (1) preventing voter \n22  fraud  and  limiting  voting  to  individuals  eligible  to  vote,  and  (2)  improving  public \n23  confidence in Arizona’s elections.  \n24  1.  Preventing  Ineligible  Individuals  from  Registering  to  Vote  or \n25  Voting in Arizona \n26  It is a felony to knowingly register oneself or another person to vote, “knowing” \n27 \n28 \n \n- 28 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  that the registrant is not eligible to vote. § 16-182. Dr. Lorraine Minnite28 opined that voter \n2  fraud is exceedingly rare nationally and in Arizona. (Minnite Tr. 1578:13–1582:7.) Dr. \n3  Minnite and Dr. Mark Hoekstra29 agreed, however, that voter fraud can be difficult to \n4  detect. (Minnite Tr. 1565:23–1566:8, 1567:14–22; Hoekstra Tr. 1747:3–1748:2.) As part \n5  of her “mixed methods”30 approach, Dr. Minnite analyzed prosecution data from the U.S. \n6  Attorney General’s office. Between 2002 and 2005, 200 million votes were cast in federal \n7  elections. (Minnite Tr. 1579:4–13.) During this time, the U.S. Attorney General began its \n8  “Ballot Access and Voting Integrity Initiative” to identify voter intimidation and voter \n9  fraud. (Id. 1578:13–25.) The U.S. Attorney General’s office indicted 40 individual voters \n10  for voter fraud from 2002 to 2005 through the initiative, with only 15 indictments for non-\n11  citizen voting. (Minnite Tr. 1578:13–1580:1.) In addition, nearly one billion votes were \n12  cast from 2000 to 2017, but U.S. Attorney offices initiated less than 200 election-related \n13  cases. (Id. 1580:19–1581:21.)  \n14  The  Arizona  Attorney  General’s  office  maintains  a  list  of  all  election-related \n15  prosecutions. According to this list, there have been 38 total prosecutions related to illegal \n16  voting by the Attorney General since 2008, none of which involved a charge of non-citizen \n17  voting. (Ex. 292 at PX 292-1 to -6; Lawson Tr. 1688:3–1690:7.) The Attorney General’s \n18  office is aware of two current indictments against alleged non-citizen voters, both which \n19  involve individuals who engaged in systematic identity theft. (Lawson Tr. 1691:11–15, \n20  1707:8–1708:4.) These cases are sealed and were not known to the Arizona Legislature at \n21 \n \n28 Dr. Minnite is an associate professor at Rutgers University and has studied the incidence \n22 \nof voter fraud in U.S. elections for 20 years. (Minnite Tr. 1555:19–1556:9.) Dr. Minnite is \nthe author of a leading book regarding the incidence of voter fraud, which the United States \n23 \nGovernment Accountability Office has recognized as scientifically reliable. (Id. 1557:13–\n1559:13.) The Court found Dr. Minnite credible and affords substantial weight to her \n24 \nopinions.  \n29 Dr. Hoekstra is a professor of economics at Baylor University. (Hoekstra Tr. 1640:20–\n25 \n21.) Dr. Hoekstra has published one paper on the impact of photo identification laws. (Id. \n1642:20–24.) Defendants offered Dr. Hoekstra’s testimony to rebut Dr. Burch’s, Dr. \n26 \nMcDonald’s, and Dr. Minnite’s opinions regarding issues of the Voting Laws’ correlation \nto, among other things, disparate registration and voting outcomes. (Id. 1654:7–9.) The \n27 \nCourt found Dr. Hoekstra credible and affords his opinions only some weight.   \n30 The mixed methods approach combines quantitative data and qualitative sources to \n28 \nidentify patterns in the research and infer a conclusion from this information. (Minnite Tr. \n1564:6–1565:22, 1570:12–1571:4.) \n \n- 29 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  the time it enacted the Voting Laws. (Lawson Tr. 1708:14–23.) The Attorney General’s \n2  office also receives complaints from the public that non-citizens are voting in Arizona, \n3  including allegations regarding specific voters, though these allegations have never led to \n4  any prosecutions. (Knuth Tr. 2109:6–2110:2, 2120:11–2121:9; Ex. 286, Ex. 287.) Dr. \n5  Minnite identified 13 prosecutions for non-citizen voting in Maricopa County between \n6  2007 and 2008. (Minnite Tr. 1588:3–23.) \n7    Aside from prosecutions, Ms. Petty could recall “one or two instances” in which the \n8  Maricopa County Recorder’s office confirmed that a registered voter was a non-citizen \n9  after  receiving  notice  from  the  jury  office  that  a  potential  juror  self-reported  non-\n10  citizenship. (Petty Tr. 105:24–107:24.) Other county recorders reported being unaware of \n11  the prevalence of non-citizens registering to vote or voting. (See Pima Dep. 241:14–242:11; \n12  Doc. 679-3, Ex. 17, 30(b)(6) Dep. of Pinal County Recorder (“Pinal Dep.”) 114:19–115:1.) \n13  In addition, county recorders often receive faulty voter registration forms from third-party \n14  registration drives. For example, both Maricopa County and Pima County reported a \n15  marked increase in these forms during the 2022 election cycle. (Petty Tr. 137:21–24; Hiser \n16  Tr. 1995:7–1996:19.) But Defendants adduced no evidence indicating that these forms \n17  were submitted in an attempt to register non-citizens. (See, e.g., Hiser Tr. 1995:21–1998:15 \n18  (Pima County receiving registration forms purported to be for deceased voters); Johnston \n19  Tr. 2083:6–2085:5 (Yuma County receiving registration forms containing falsified or \n20  incorrect birth date, SSN4, or residence information).) Nor is there evidence that any of \n21  Arizona’s Federal-Only Voters are non-citizens.  \n22  The Court finds that though it may occur, non-citizens voting in Arizona is quite \n23  rare, and non-citizen voter fraud in Arizona is rarer still. But while the Voting Laws are \n24  not likely to meaningfully reduce possible non-citizen voting in Arizona, they could help \n25  to prevent non-citizens from registering or voting. (See Minnite Tr. 1563:3–14 (opining the \n26  Voting Laws will not “reduce” voting fraud “further”).)  \n27      2.  Voter Confidence \n28    Evidence at trial indicates that members of the public have expressed concerns about \n \n- 30 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  election integrity in Arizona, specifically as it relates to non-citizens voting in federal \n2  elections. (Knuth Tr. 2121:12–23; Lawson Tr. 1696:18–25; Quezada Tr. 877:8–878:17.) \n3  For  example,  when  drafting  the  2023  EPM,  the  Secretary  of  State  received  public \n4  comments  for  two  weeks,  approximately  one-quarter  of  which  were  “form”  letters \n5  commenting that “voters should be citizens” or should prove their citizenship. (Connor Tr. \n6  382:12–383:25.)  \n7  According to Dr. Hoekstra, the Voting Laws could reduce perceptions of voter fraud \n8  by persuading voters that Arizona is taking precautions to make it more difficult for non-\n9  citizens to vote. (Hoekstra Tr. 1751:18–1752:9, 1870:2–16; see also Richman Tr. 1933:10–\n10  18,  1934:16–23,  1935:14–17  (opining  that  the  Voting  Laws  “should”  improve  voter \n11  confidence).) Dr. Hoekstra cited a study that found “a couple percentage points” increase \n12  in voter confidence among individuals who were notified before an election that their state \n13  had a voter identification law. (Id. 1752:15–1753:16.) However, measuring improved voter \n14  confidence typically requires voters to be well-informed about the election law, and \n15  Defendants adduced no evidence quantifying the likelihood that Arizonans will become \n16  aware of the Voting Laws and their purported impacts on preventing voter fraud in Arizona. \n17  (See id. 1797:18–1800:16, 1866:4–1867:25.)  \n18  No party offered direct evidence predicting the expected effects of the Voting Laws \n19  on Arizonans’ confidence in the State’s elections.  \n20  D.  Intent and Effects of the Voting Laws \n21  1.  Evidence of Discrimination \n22  i.  History of Discrimination in Arizona \n23  Plaintiffs offered the expert testimony of Dr. Orville Burton and Dr. Derek Chang \n24  to illustrate the Voting Laws in the context of Arizona’s history of discrimination. Plaintiffs \n25  offered Dr. Burton as “an expert in American history, voting behavior, discrimination, \n26  socioeconomic  status  and  equality  and  historical  intent.”31  (Burton  Tr.  1403:20–22.) \n27   \n31 Overall, the Court affords Dr. Burton’s opinions some weight but questions the reliability \n28  of some of his testimony regarding Arizona history. For example, Dr. Burton testified that \n \n \n- 31 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs offered Dr. Chang as an expert on historical patterns between the Voting Laws \n2  and other discriminatory laws.32 (Chang Tr. 1335:17–24.) \n3  Before statehood, Arizona banned intermarriage between Asians and White people. \n4  (Chang  Tr.  1346:19–1347:15,  see  id.  1337:24–1338:19  (describing  the  “Period  of \n5  Immigration”).) Though Arizona historically banned interracial marriage, an Arizona state \n6  court ruled this to be unconstitutional before Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967); (Burton \n7  Tr. 1415:1–21, 1504:6–24.) Arizona also passed an “alien land law” in 1921 that barred \n8  immigrants who were ineligible to become U.S. citizens—specifically, people of Asian \n9  descent—from owning land. (Chang Tr. 1349:16–1350:5.) In 1953, Arizona courts ordered \n10  the  full  desegregation  of  schools.  (Burton  Tr.  1421:19–1422:2,  1507:25–1508:17.) \n11  Following desegregation, however, Arizona continued to require English-only classroom \n12  instruction,  thereby  producing  disparate  educational  outcomes  particularly  for  Native \n13  Americans and Spanish speakers. (Id. 1422:3–7, 1423:5–23.) Arizonans also amended the \n14  Arizona Constitution in 1988 to mandate that all political subdivisions of Arizona act only \n15  in English, but the Arizona Supreme Court ruled this unconstitutional. See Ruiz v. Hull, \n16 \n \nArizona had been deemed the “twelfth star of the Confederacy,” but it was unclear whether \n17 \nhe understood this to refer to the former territory that encompassed both Arizona and New \nMexico at the time, or what would become Arizona following statehood. (Burton Tr. \n18 \n1491:16–1493:23,  see  also  id.  1496:14–24  (failing  to  consider  Arizona’s  history  of \nsupporting the Union), 1498:17–1500:23 (Arizona’s prohibition of slavery).) Dr. Burton \n19 \nalso lacked a strong understanding of existing Arizona election law. (See, e.g., id. 1528:8–\n1529:20 (incorrectly believing voters removed for non-citizenship were not notified under \n20 \nprevious Arizona law), 1536:4–16 (unaware if polling locations are open past 5:00 PM).) \nAnd Dr. Burton did not consider it necessary to consult the legislative history of the Voting \n21 \nLaws in forming his opinions. (Id. 1542:12–24.)  \n32 The Court affords Dr. Chang’s opinions little weight. Dr. Chang did not review the \n22 \nlegislative history of the Voting Laws because he did not believe it would have been \nparticularly useful when comparing the Voting Laws to broader historical patterns of \n23 \ndiscrimination.  (Chang  Tr.  1342:8–12,  1382:8–19.)  Dr.  Chang  informed  most  of  his \nopinion by considering the history of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (“AAPI”) \n24 \ncommunity from a national perspective. (See id. 1345:20–1346:3 (discussing the federal \nPage Act), 1348:1–23 (discussing the Federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882).) As for \n25 \nsome of the history of discrimination against the AAPI community in Arizona, Dr. Chang’s \nopinions were incomplete or misleading. For example, he opined that a recent House Bill \n26 \nwas like Arizona’s 1921 “alien land law,” but he had not read the bill in its entirety, which \nprohibits land sales and leases to specific foreign governments or companies. (Id. 1375:14–\n27 \n1377:14); H.B. 2376, 56th Leg., 1st Sess. (Ariz. 2023). Dr. Chang also asserted that \nPhoenix experienced a 50% increase in anti-Asian violence from 2019 to 2020, which \n28 \nwhile correct, was an increase from just two reports of violence in 2019 to three in 2020. \n(Chang Tr. 1383:2–1384:24, 1385:3–9.) \n \n- 32 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  957 P.2d 984, 998, 1000 (Ariz. 1998). \n2  Arizona also has a well-documented history of voting discrimination. For example, \n3  the territorial government imposed a literacy test as a prerequisite to voting to limit the \n4  “ignorant Mexican vote,” which Arizona renewed in 1912 after statehood. (Burton Tr. \n5  1429:1–1431:22.) And while Native Americans were granted citizenship in 1924, Arizona \n6  courts only recognized their right to vote in 1948. (Id. 1432:16–1434:1, 1513:2–8); see \n7  Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, Pub. L. No. 68-175, 43 Stat. 253 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \n8  § 1401(b)). However, Arizona’s literacy requirement stood until 1972, meaning many \n9  Native Americans were, for all intents and purposes, still unable to vote. (Burton Tr. \n10  1432:16–1434:1); see Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970) (finding amendment to the \n11  Voting Rights Act banning literacy tests constitutional). In the 1970s and 1980s, Arizona \n12  conducted “total” voter roll purges that required individuals to re-register to vote, but fewer \n13  minority  voters  would re-register compared to White  voters.  (Burton Tr. 1435:3–10, \n14  1436:3–11.) Dr. Burton also cited at least one example of a Maricopa County election \n15  official requesting DPOC around this time even though DPOC was not required by law. \n16  (Id. 1435:10–20.) And for forty years, Arizona was subject to section 5 of the Voting Rights \n17  Act, which required Arizona to seek “preclearance of changes affecting voting.”33 28 \n18  C.F.R. pt. 51, App. (2012). \n19  Plaintiffs offered evidence that disparate socioeconomic outcomes remain pervasive \n20  for communities of color. The median household income for Black, Native Indian and \n21  Alaska Native, and Latino individuals is approximately $9,000 to $21,000 less than the \n22  household average. (Doc. 672-3, Ex. 28, (“ACS Household Income”) at ECF-59.) Non-\n23  White Arizonans are also more likely than White Arizonans to live in a household with an \n24  income falling below the poverty line. (Pls.’ Judicial Notice ¶ 27.) For example, 19.2% of \n25  Latino Arizonans live in a household below the poverty line, compared to 9.6% of White \n26  Arizonans, although naturalized citizens are less likely than native-born citizens to live in \n27 \n \n33 In Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder, the Supreme Court held that the formula for \n28 \ndetermining  “covered  jurisdictions”  that  were  required  to  seek  preclearance  was \nunconstitutional. 570 U.S. 529, 556–57 (2013). \n \n- 33 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  poverty.  (Doc.  672-3,  Ex.  27,  (“ACS  Poverty  Rates”)  at  ECF-51,  -53.)  Moreover, \n2  approximately 72% of voting-age Latino and 78% of American Indian or Alaska Native \n3  Arizonans have earned a high school diploma or equivalent, compared to 95% of White \n4  Arizonans. (Doc. 672-3, Ex. 29, (“ACS Educational Attainment”) at ECF-71, -74.) \n5      ii.  The Voting Laws’ Legislative History  \n6  Arizona’s November 2020 presidential election was decided in favor of President \n7  Biden by a margin of 10,457 votes. (Pls.’ Stip. No. 154.) Former President Trump falsely \n8  claimed that non-citizens had illegally cast more than 36,000 ballots in the election. \n9  (Minnite Tr. 1597:5–11.) President Trump’s attorney Rudolph Giuliani also stated that tens \n10  of thousands of “illegal aliens” voted in Arizona, which a New York state appellate court \n11  found “false and misleading.” In the Matter of Rudolph W. Guiliani, 146 N.Y.S. 3d 266, \n12  268, 279–80 (N.Y. App. Div. 2021). Against this backdrop, the Arizona Senate established \n13  a committee to audit  the 2020 election,  which revealed no evidence of  voter  fraud. \n14  (Quezada Tr. 824:15–825:9.)  \n15  Prior to passing the Voting Laws, the Arizona Legislature did not establish that any \n16  non-citizens were registered to vote in Arizona. (Doc. 679-1, Ex. 6, (“Toma Dep.”) 99:20–\n17  22, 100:1–5, 102:7–21; Doc. 679-2, Ex. 7, (“Petersen Dep.”) 84:15–85:5.) Neither Speaker \n18  Toma  nor  President  Petersen  could  recall  the  Legislature  being  presented  with  or \n19  considering  evidence  of  non-citizen  voter  fraud  in  Arizona.  (Toma  Dep.  99:12–18; \n20  Petersen Dep. 95:6–8, 95:11–96:10, 184:18–185:4.)  \n21    H.B. 2492 was introduced to the Arizona House of Representatives on January 24, \n22  2022. (Pls.’ Stip. No. 42.) Representative Jake Hoffman was the prime sponsor of H.B. \n23  2492 and the Arizona Free Enterprise Club34 helped draft the substance of the bill. (Toma \n24  Dep. 139:19–20; Peterson Dep. 158:7–13, 159:19–160:7; see Ex. 54, (“H.B. 2492 House \n25  Gov. Comm. Tr.”) at PX 054-5 to -7.) In support of H.B. 2492’s DPOC Requirement, \n26  Representative Hoffman explained during a House Government and Elections Committee \n27 \n \n34 The Free Enterprise Club is a conservative lobbying group that advocated for the Voting \n28 \nLaws to address “how more illegals started voting in AZ.” (Ex. 602 (email from Arizona \nFree Enterprise Club to Senator Petersen).)  \n \n- 34 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  meeting that following the LULAC Consent Decree, more than 11,600 individuals had \n2  registered to vote in federal elections without DPOC. (H.B. 2492 House Gov. Comm. Tr. \n3  at PX 054-3 to -4.) On February 22, 2022, a majority of the House Rules Committee voted \n4  in favor of H.B. 2492 over the concerns of the Committee’s counsel that the NVRA likely \n5  pre-empted the bill’s DPOC Requirement for Federal Form applicants. (See generally Ex. \n6  57.) The Arizona House of Representatives passed the bill. (See generally Exs. 58, 59.)  \n7  The Arizona Senate Judiciary Committee met on March 10, 2022 to discuss the bill. \n8  (See generally Ex. 61.) In explaining his vote against H.B. 2492 during the committee \n9  meeting, then-Senator Martin Quezada indicated that the bill would disproportionately \n10  “target[]” people of color, leading Senator Petersen to call a recess after the audience began \n11  to audibly react. (Id. at PX 061-34 to -36.) The Senate passed H.B. 2492 on March 23, \n12  2022, which then-Governor Doug Ducey signed into law.  (Ex. 62, at PX 062-22; Pls.’ \n13  Stip. No. 43.) H.B. 2492 took effect January 1, 2023. (Pls.’ Stip. Nos. 44–45.) The \n14  legislative  history  indicates  that  the  legislators  in  favor  of  the  bill  were  concerned \n15  specifically with the increase of Federal-Only Voters in Arizona who had not provided \n16  DPOC. (See, e.g., H.B. 2492 House Gov. Comm. Tr. at PX 054-3.) \n17  H.B. 2243 was first introduced in the Arizona Legislature in January 2022. (See \n18  generally Ex. 68.) As originally drafted, H.B. 2243 amended only § 16-152 to require a \n19  notice on the State Form informing the voter that her registration would be cancelled if the \n20  voter moved permanently to a different state. (See generally Exs. 705, 707.) On January \n21  31, 2022, H.B. 2617 was introduced, which would have required county recorders to cancel \n22  a voter’s registration if the county recorder “confirms” either that the voter is a non-citizen \n23  or was issued an out-of-state identification, and the voter failed to furnish “satisfactory \n24  evidence that the person is qualified” within 90 days of receiving notice of cancellation.35 \n \n25  35 As discussed supra Section I(B)(5)(i), county recorders previously provided a voter with \n35 days to submit DPOC if that voter had indicated on a juror questionnaire that they were \n26 \nnot a U.S. citizen, and voter’s registration file lacked DPOC. Also, before the introduction \nof H.B. 2617, voters were also entitled to a 35-day final notice to update the voter’s address \n27 \nand avoid being placed into inactive status if official election mail was returned to county \nrecorders as undeliverable. (2019 EPM at PX 006-52 (describing the process to satisfy the \n28 \nNVRA); see also id. at PX 006-52 to -53 (describing similar process when a county \nrecorder receives information from USPS’s National Change of Address Service).)  \n \n- 35 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  (Ex. 4, (“H.B. 2617 Text”) at PX 004-2 to -3; see generally Ex. 67, (“H.B. 2617 Bill \n2  History”).) House Representative Joseph Chaplik was the Primary Sponsor of H.B. 2617, \n3  and the Arizona Free Enterprise Club helped draft the bill. (H.B. 2617 Bill History at PX \n4  067-1; Petersen Tr. 238:4–8.) On May 25, 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed H.B. 2617. \n5  (See H.B. 2617 Bill History at PX 067-3; see also Exs. 490, 491, 494, 495, 497, 498.) \n6  Governor Ducey vetoed the bill, noting that H.B. 2617 was “vague and lack[ed] any \n7  guidance for how a county recorder would” determine whether a person was a “qualified \n8  elector.” (Ex. 53, (“H.B. 2617 Veto Letter”) at PX 053-1; see H.B. 2617 Text at PX 004-2 \n9  to -3 (requiring county recorder to cancel voter registration when the county recorder \n10  confirms that a voter is “not a qualified elector”).) \n11  Following  Governor  Ducey’s  veto  of  H.B.  2617,  Representative  Toma  and \n12  Representative Chaplik decided to include an amended version of H.B. 2617 into H.B. \n13  2243. (See Toma Dep. 235:7–23, 240:2–3, 246:23–247:6, 257:13–17.) Senator Petersen \n14  sponsored the amendment in the Senate, and on the last day of the legislative session, \n15  proposed a floor amendment36 in the Committee of the Whole to incorporate H.B. 2617 \n16  into  H.B.  2243.  (Ex.  708;  Petersen  Dep.  247:10–20,  268:6–22,  269:2–10.)  Senators \n17  Quezada and Petersen, and Representative Toma all agreed that last-minute amendments \n18  commonly occur at the end of the legislative session, though Senator Quezada testified that \n19  it was abnormal for “significant” amendments to be introduced so late in the legislative \n20  session. (See Quezada Tr. 860:9–861:16; Toma Dep. at 237:8–239:3; Petersen Dep. at \n21  319:3–24.)  \n22  Senator  Petersen  characterized  the  amendments  to  H.B.  2243  as  essentially \n23  “identical to” H.B. 2617, except for some “additional notice requirements.” (Ex. 499 at PX \n24  499-3.) But H.B. 2243 provides voters with 35 days to furnish DPOC instead of the 90 \n25  originally in H.B. 2617. (Compare H.B. 2243 Text at PX 002-5 to -6, with H.B. 2617 Text \n26  at PX 004-3.) H.B. 2243 also differs from H.B. 2617 by requiring county recorders to place \n27 \n \n36 A floor amendment allows a legislator to include the substance of a bill that has changed \n28 \nafter leaving its assigned committees into a separate “germane” bill within the same section \nor title of the Arizona Revised Statutes. (Petersen Dep. 270:3–10.) \n \n- 36 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  a voter’s registration into inactive status instead of cancelling the registration if the voter \n2  fails to attest (instead of providing “satisfactory evidence”) that she is an Arizona resident \n3  within 90 days. (Compare H.B. 2243 Text at PX 002-6, with H.B. 2617 Text at PX 004-3.) \n4  There is no explanation for these changes in the legislative record except that H.B. 2243 as \n5  amended “addresses the [Governor’s] veto letter.” (Ex. 499 at PX 499-3.) The Committee \n6  of the Whole adopted Senator Petersen’s floor amendment. (Id. at PX 499-6.) The Arizona \n7  Legislature then passed H.B. 2243, which Governor Ducey signed into law.37 (See Exs. 68, \n8  500.)  \n9  Nothing in the legislative history of H.B. 2492 or H.B. 2243 reflects an intent to \n10  suppress voter registrations of members of minority groups or naturalized citizens.38 (See \n11  generally H.B. 2492 House Gov. Comm. Tr.; Exs. 57, 58, 61, 490, 491, 494, 495, 497–\n12  500.) The evidence indicates that concerns of reinforcing election integrity in response to \n13  the increase in Federal-Only Voters drove the Legislature’s enactment of the Voting Laws. \n14  (See, e.g., H.B. 2492 House Gov. Comm. Tr. at PX 054-3.) Plaintiffs did not adduce \n15  evidence challenging the sincerity of some Arizonans’ beliefs that non-citizens had voted \n16  in the 2020 election. And while there is no evidence that Federal-Only Voters may be non-\n17  citizens,  the  Legislature’s  decision  to  scrutinize  these  voters  does  not  ring  of \n18  discrimination. In addition, the justification for the Birthplace Requirement came from a \n19  representative for the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, who explained that birthplace could \n20  help identify voters in the databases enumerated in the Voting Laws, such as NAPHSIS. \n21  (Ex. 61 at PX 061-24 to -26.) The legislative record lacks any indicia of a nefarious motive. \n22  And despite Dr. Chang and Dr. Burton’s account of Arizona’s history of discrimination, \n23  neither expert articulated a persuasive factual nexus between this history and the Fifty-\n24  Fifth Legislature’s enactment of the Voting Laws. \n \n25  37 H.B. 2243 supersedes H.B. 2492 § 8, which would have directed county recorders to \ncancel the registrations of voters who county recorders “confirm[]” are not U.S. citizens, \n26 \nwithout first providing notice or an opportunity for voters to furnish DPOC. (See H.B. 2492 \n§ 8.) \n27  38 Plaintiffs make much of ongoing discriminatory comments Senator Borelli purportedly \nmade to Senator Quezada during Senator Quezada’s time in the Senate, but regardless of \n28 \nwhat Senator Borelli may have expressed, Plaintiffs cannot impute his beliefs or motives \nto the entire Arizona Legislature. \n \n- 37 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1      2.  Effect of the Voting Laws on Voters \n2  Most of H.B. 2243 requires no action on the part of voters. Its List Maintenance \n3  Procedures impose obligations on county recorders and the Secretary of State to ensure \n4  that all registered voters are U.S. citizens. See § 16-165(G)–(J). Only if a county recorder \n5  “confirms” a voter is a non-citizen must that voter produce DPOC within 35 days to avoid \n6  having her registration cancelled and referred to the attorney general for investigation. Id. \n7  § 16-165(A)(10). H.B. 2492’s Citizenship Verification Procedures and Attorney General \n8  Referral Provision similarly require county recorders and the attorney general to investigate \n9  the citizenship status of registrants and voters without DPOC. §§ 16-121.01(D), 16-143(B). \n10  Dr. Traci Burch39 applied the “rational choice” framework to analyze the burdens \n11  the Voting Laws would impose on Arizona voters. The rational-choice framework weighs \n12  the perceived probable rewards of an action against the probable corresponding costs to \n13  predict the likelihood that an individual will perform the action. (Burch  Tr. 931:20–\n14  932:11.) The three primary costs are: (1) learning costs, such as learning how to register to \n15  vote; (2) compliance costs, such as the cost to obtain the information necessary to register \n16  to vote; and (3) psychological costs, or the emotional burdens associated with performing \n17  the action and the resulting effects of that action. (Id. 933:13–17, 934:10–25, 935:15–\n18  936:7.) Individuals of higher socioeconomic status are typically better positioned to bear \n19  these costs as compared to individuals of lower socioeconomic status. (Id. 940:23–941:24, \n20  942:19–944:12.) \n21  Dr. Burch opined that requiring DPOC to register to vote and avoid removal from \n22  the voter rolls will increase compliance costs for Arizona voters, particularly those who \n23  lack ready access to DPOC. (Id. 969:5–9.) Plaintiff representatives testified that some \n24  citizens residing in Arizona may lack ready access to the information that constitutes \n25  DPOC in Arizona. (See, e.g., Nitschke Tr. 469:8–470:3 (explaining out-of-state students \n26 \n \n39 Dr. Burch is an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University and a \n27 \nresearch professor at the American Bar Foundation. (Burch Tr. 923:23–25.) Dr. Burch \ntestified to the burdens the Voting Laws may impose on individuals in attempting to vote. \n28 \n(Id. 927:16–18, 928:16–929:3.) The Court found Dr. Burch credible and affords her \nopinions considerable weight. \n \n- 38 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  may  keep  records  with  parents);  Tiwamangkala  Tr.  1273:22–1274:3  (explaining  that \n2  Equity  Coalition’s  partner  organization  helps  AANHPI  individuals  obtain  citizenship \n3  documentation to apply for government benefits).) Estimates suggest that around seven \n4  percent of all U.S. citizens lack ready access to proof of citizenship. (Hoekstra Tr. 1838:24–\n5  1839:10.) But Plaintiffs adduced no evidence estimating the number of Federal-Only \n6  Voters who lack all acceptable forms of DPOC. Nor did Plaintiffs show that naturalized \n7  citizens or people of color are more likely than their White counterparts to lack DPOC. \n8  And assuming all of Arizona’s Federal-Only Voters did not possess DPOC at the time of \n9  registration, this would account for less than half a percent of the State’s registered voters. \n10  (See Ex. 336; Pls.’ Stip. No. 26 (19,439/4,198,726=0.4%).)  \n11  Aside from Federal-Only Voters, Dr. McDonald testified that county recorders \n12  cancelled 1,290 Arizona voter registrations for “Invalid Citizenship Proof,” and suspended \n13  5,555 additional voter registrations for this same reason. (McDonald Tr. 1106:25–11, \n14  1111:13–21; see Registration Cancellation Rates; Registration Suspension Rates.) Dr. \n15  McDonald did not, however, opine on whether these were citizens who did not possess or \n16  could  not  provide  DPOC,  but  instead  offered  these  figures  as  evidence  that  county \n17  recorders  historically  have  not  uniformly  implemented  Arizona’s  election  laws. \n18  (McDonald Tr. 1107:12–22, 1232:2–1234:13.) For example, Cochise County appears to \n19  have placed voter registrations in suspense status for lacking DPOC, rather than registering \n20  these registrants as Federal-Only Voters. (See, e.g., Ex. 510.) Dr. Richman noted that most \n21  of these voters did not match with any MVD file containing citizenship information, in \n22  which case county recorders could not have relied on stale MVD data to cancel or suspend \n23  these registrations. (Richman Tr. 1954:12–1956:3; MVD Non-Citizen Records (indicating \n24  lack  of  MVD  matches  for  858  of  1,290  cancelled  registrations  and  5,010  of  5,555 \n25  suspended registrations but listing 77 cancelled registrations for lack of DPOC and 253 \n26  suspended registrations for “Invalid Citizenship Proof” in MVD).) Dr. Richman also \n27  explained that AVID’s coding system to suspend and cancel voter registrations for “Invalid \n28  Citizenship  Proof”  contained  “overlapping  codes.”  (See,  e.g.,  Richman  Tr.  1917:11–\n \n- 39 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  1919:11  (explaining  citizenship  cancellation  codes  include  voluntary  and  involuntary \n2  cancellation); see also Ex. 796, (listing an “Invalid Citizenship Proof” code for registrants \n3  who  are  “Not  Eligible,”  but  lacking  any  similar  code  for  cancelled  or  suspended \n4  registrants).) The Court finds that Arizona’s cancellation and suspension of approximately \n5  7,000 voter registrations for “Invalid Citizenship Proof” is not probative of the number of \n6  qualified Arizonans unable to provide DPOC when registering to vote. \n7  Plaintiffs did offer evidence that obtaining DPOC could impose a financial burden \n8  on low-income voters. For example, the cost of obtaining a copy of an Arizona birth \n9  certificate  is  35  dollars.40  (Doc.  672-7,  Ex.  50.)  The  fee  to  replace  a  naturalization \n10  certificate  is  significantly  greater,  costing  $555.41  (Doc.  672-7,  Ex.  53.)  However, \n11  naturalized citizens are less likely than native-born citizens to live in a household with \n12  income below the poverty line, and furthermore, naturalized citizens need only provide an \n13  immigration number as DPOC if they do not possess a naturalization certificate. § 16-\n14  166(F)(4). Furthermore, while approximately 19% of Latino individuals live in a household \n15  below the poverty line, 82% of Arizona’s Latino citizens are native-born, meaning most \n16  Latinos will not be burdened by the considerably higher costs associated with obtaining \n17  new naturalization documents. \n18  Dr. Burch opined that requiring voters to provide DPOC and subjecting voters who \n19  cannot provide DPOC to potential investigation could also impose psychological costs. \n20  (Burch  Tr.  946:12–947:9,  969:5–9,  972:14–23,  993:6–17.)  Specifically,  Latino  and \n21  AANHPI voters may fear drawing attention to their families, particularly voters who live \n22  with non-citizens in mixed-status households. (Id. 993:18–994:7; see also Tiwamangkala \n23  Tr. 1274:19–1275:3 (chilling effect among AANHPI community); Guzman Tr. 480:9–\n24  481:18 (chilling effect among Latino community).) For instance, pursuant to H.B. 2243’s \n25 \n \n40 Plaintiffs ask the Court to take judicial notice of the cost of obtaining a passport. But a \n26 \nU.S. citizen must provide proof of U.S. citizenship to obtain a passport or pay an additional \n150-dollar fee for the United States to conduct a search for a previously issued passport. \n27 \nThe Court gives little weight to the burden of obtaining a passport because an individual \nmay obtain a new birth certificate for substantially less and in less time. (Compare Doc. \n28 \n672-7, Ex. 50, with Doc. 672-7, Ex. 51, at ECF-13, 16.)  \n41 It can take up to eight months to receive a replacement certificate. (Doc. 672-7, Ex. 54.) \n \n- 40 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  mandate that the Secretary of State compare AVID to the MVD database each month, the \n2  MVD customer extract will flag all individuals with a foreign-type credential as non-\n3  citizens, despite that this information will be outdated for the 6,084 naturalized Full-Ballot \n4  Voters who still possess an unexpired foreign-type credential. And because MVD does not \n5  issue foreign-type credentials to native-born citizens, only naturalized citizens will ever be \n6  misidentified as non-citizens. H.B. 2243’s Reason to Believe Provision will similarly affect \n7  only naturalized citizens because SAVE cannot search for native-born citizens. The Latino \n8  and AANHPI communities may associate these procedures with Arizona’s history of \n9  discriminatory treatment against people of color. (See supra Section I(D)(1)(i).) \n10  The Court finds that the compliance and psychological costs associated with the \n11  Voting Laws’ DPOC Requirements42 and investigative procedures would predominately \n12  impact voters of lower socioeconomic status and naturalized citizens. Plaintiffs did not, \n13  however, quantify the scope of this impact, given the lack of evidence regarding the \n14  distribution of voters who do not possess or would be unable to obtain DPOC. As for the \n15  Voting Laws’ Birthplace Requirement, Plaintiffs did not adduce any evidence that voters \n16  would be unable to include birthplace information. However, the evidence shows that \n17  Latino and AANHPI voters could be deterred from registering to vote due to fears of \n18  investigation. \n19  E.  Plaintiffs Sue for Relief  \n20    Following the passage of the Voting Laws, the United States and a collection of \n21  nonpublic  entities  (collectively,  “Plaintiffs”)  filed  several  lawsuits  seeking  injunctive \n22  relief. (See, e.g., Doc. 1, 2:22-cv-00519-SRB; Doc. 1, 2:22-cv-01124-SRB.) The Court \n23  consolidated the Plaintiffs’ eight lawsuits into the instant case. (See Docs. 39, 48, 69, 79, \n24  91, 164, 193.) Together, Plaintiffs claim the Voting Laws, among other things, (1) violate \n25  the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the NVRA, and the Voting Rights Act; (2) place an undue \n26  burden on the right to vote; and (3) violate the due process and equal protection guarantees \n \n27  42 The Court uses “DPOC Requirements” to refer to H.B. 2492 § 4’s mandate that all voter \nregistrations include DPOC to be registered as a Full-Ballot Voter, as well as H.B. 2492 \n28 \n§ 4 and H.B. 2243 § 2’s requirement that a registrant or voter provide DPOC if a county \nrecorder matches that individual to information of non-citizenship.  \n \n- 41 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  of the U.S. Constitution. (See Doc. 304.) The Republican National Committee (“RNC”), \n2  Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen, and Arizona House of Representatives Speaker \n3  Ben Toma, intervened as defendants. (Doc. 18, 2:22-cv-01369-SRB; Doc. 363.)  \n4  The Voting Laws have not yet been enforced, but many non-US Plaintiffs have \n5  already shifted their operations to mitigate the anticipated impacts of the laws, while other \n6  non-US Plaintiffs anticipate doing so if the Voting Laws take effect. All non-US Plaintiffs \n7  assert an interest in maximizing voter turnout among certain communities, including \n8  Latinos,  Native  Americans,  AANHPI  individuals,  Black  Americans,  students,  young \n9  people, the elderly, and Democratic voters generally. \n10      1.  Mi Familia Vota \n11  Mi Familia Vota is a national, nonprofit civic engagement organization that seeks \n12  to increase civic participation in the Latino community and “ensure that as many people as \n13  possible  can participate in the democratic  process, including members of the  Latino \n14  community.”  (Rodriguez-Greer  Tr.  780:20–25,  781:22–782:2).  At  trial,  Carolina \n15  Rodriguez-Greer, Mi Familia Vota’s State Director for Arizona, testified that Mi Familia \n16  Vota engages in “year-round” voter engagement efforts and has a reputation as a “trusted \n17  community resource” on voting and civic participation. (Id. 780:14–17, 782:14–18). Mi \n18  Familia Vota’s voting-related activities include providing election resources in Spanish, \n19  hosting voter education workshops, assisting permanent legal residents with the citizenship \n20  application process, and registering voters by tabling at events and with paid canvassers. \n21  (Id.  781:22–782:24,  785:4–17.)  Mi  Familia  Vota  provides  in-depth  training  to  its \n22  canvassers on the voter registration forms and on how to engage with potential voters in \n23  the communities that the organization serves. (Id. 783:25–784:7.) Mi Familia Vota has \n24  registered over 30,000 voters in Arizona since 2021. (Id. 780:18–19, 784:12–14.) \n25  Mi Familia Vota claims that the Birthplace Requirement will impact its  voter \n26  registration efforts because the community members it serves are often hesitant to share \n27  personal information with the government, including their place of birth. (Id. 786:12–\n28  787:3,  787:15–788:8.)  Rodriguez-Greer  testified  that  she  observed  this  fear  among \n \n- 42 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  naturalized citizens growing up in Tucson, Arizona, which is less than 100 miles from the \n2  U.S.-Mexico  border.  (Id.  786:12–787:3.)  Mi  Familia  Vota  does  not  have  additional \n3  resources to devote to mitigate the anticipated effects of the Voting Laws, so it expects that \n4  it will need to “go into crisis mode” and redirect existing funds toward new voter education \n5  initiatives. (Id. 791:16–792:4, 809:24–810:1.) For example, Mi Familia Vota anticipates \n6  redirecting staff members from its ambassadors program, which is designed educate voters \n7  about basic election issues, to a new effort that addresses community members’ confusion \n8  about the Voting Laws and educates them about the changes to the registration and voting \n9  process. (Id. 791:16–792:23.) Mi Familia Vota also expects to adjust its voter registration \n10  program  and  reallocate  its  staff’s  efforts  to  developing  a  new  training  program  for \n11  canvassers. (Id. 792:24–793:12.) Mi Familia Vota spent approximately $1.5 million on its \n12  voter engagement efforts in 2023, and it expects that its budget for voter engagement will \n13  be “significantly higher” in 2024. (Rodriguez-Greer Tr. 781:13–15, 784:19–22.) \n14      2.  Voto Latino \n15  Voto Latino is a 501(c)(4) nonpartisan, nonprofit social welfare organization that \n16  aims to “educate and empower a new generation of Latino voters in Arizona.” (Patel Tr. \n17  217:4–11.) Voto Latino’s voting-related work includes voter registration, increasing voter \n18  turnout among low-propensity voters, and advocacy. (Id. 216:16–17, 217:12–218:5.) Voto \n19  Latino’s voter registration efforts include “chase programming,” by which Voto Latino \n20  follows up with individual voters who did not complete their voter registration or may not \n21  have successfully submitted their registration to be placed onto the voter rolls. (Id. 221:20–\n22  223:14.) Since 2012, Voto Latino has registered over 60,000 voters in Arizona. (Id. \n23  220:25–221:6.)  \n24  Voto Latino claims that the Birthplace Requirement will disproportionately impact \n25  the Latino community, which is more likely to be born outside of the United States. (Id. \n26  227:10–25.) Voto Latino’s Managing Director Ameer Patel testified that Voto Latino \n27  expects to expend additional resources on its chase programming to successfully register \n28  the same number of voters as it did in the 2020 election cycle as a result of the Voting \n \n- 43 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Laws. (Id. 229:17–231:8.) Voto Latino claims that this will “take away” resources from \n2  the organization’s advocacy and turnout efforts. (Id. 238:17–23.) Voto Latino also claims \n3  that  H.B.  2492’s  Citizenship  Verification  Procedures  and  Attorney  General  Referral \n4  Provision will have a chilling effect on prospective Latino voters, which will hinder Voto \n5  Latino’s  voter  registration  and  voter  turnout  efforts  and  require  the  organization  to \n6  reallocate resources to educate voters about the investigation provisions. (Id. 236:9–237:8.) \n7  After H.B. 2492 was passed, Voto Latino spent resources and devoted staff time to create \n8  new content, including videos, infographics, one-pagers, and a press release to educate \n9  voters about the impact of the bill. (Id. 237:9–19, 253:22–254:22.) \n10      3.  Southwest Voter Registration Education Project \n11  Southwest  Voter  Registration  Education  Project  (“SVREP”)  is  a  501(c)(3) \n12  nonpartisan,  nonprofit  organization  committed  to  empowering  Latino  communities \n13  through their vote. (Camarillo Tr. 729:10–14, 730:4–13, 732:17–21.) SVREP’s voting \n14  activities include educating and registering voters, “turning out the vote,” and training \n15  candidates  who  run  for  nonpartisan  offices.  (Id.  727:14–16,  730:7–11.)  SVREP  has \n16  registered 15,000 Latino voters in Arizona since 2022. (Id. 736:9–17.) In 2024, SVERP \n17  plans  to  register  voters  by  engaging  high  schools  and  community  colleges,  meeting \n18  individuals  door-to-door,  and  conducting  voter  registration  sites.  (Id.  735:24–736:4.) \n19  SVREP is also planning to turn out the vote in 2024 by contacting voters through door-to-\n20  door visits, phone banking, and digital messaging, along with continuing its voter education \n21  efforts. (Id. 737:4–15, 738:5–11.) At trial, SVREP President Lydia Camarillo testified that \n22  SVREP anticipates reallocating funding and staff time from its voter registration, voter \n23  education, and voter turnout efforts to help voters who receive the 35-day notice letter \n24  obtain DPOC and assist voters who are removed from the voter rolls pursuant to H.B. 2243. \n25  (Id. 740:9–19, 741:6–742:6, 742:21–743:12, 743:21–745:4.) \n26      4.  Promise Arizona \n27  Promise Arizona is a community nonprofit organization that seeks to increase the \n28  participation of Latino communities from Maricopa County and throughout Arizona in the \n \n- 44 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  electoral  process.  (Falcon  Tr.  1307:3–7,  1307:24–1308:14.)  Promise  Arizona  is  a \n2  membership organization with 1,043 dues-paying members as of November 2023. (Id. \n3  1306:22–23, 1308:15–23.) Promise Arizona’s members include voters who are naturalized \n4  citizens. (Id. 1321:23–1322:3.) The primary services that Promise Arizona’s members \n5  receive are adult education and assistance with the naturalization application process. (Id. \n6  1306:20–23,  1308:24–1309:4.)  Promise  Arizona’s  core  activities  include  registering \n7  voters, educating voters, and turning out the vote, all of which are carried out by paid staff \n8  members and volunteers. (Id. 1308:7–14; 1309:5–23, 1313:15–17, 1314:11–1315:1.) Over \n9  the past ten years, Promise Arizona has registered around 63,000 voters in Arizona. (Id. \n10  1314:7–10.) In 2024, Promise Arizona expects to continue its voter turnout efforts for the \n11  primary and general elections. (Id. 1316:18–1317:1.)  \n12  At trial, Petra Falcon, Promise Arizona’s Founding Executive Director, testified that \n13  H.B. 2243 will “undo a lot of the work” the organization has done over the past decade. \n14  (Id. 1321:8–20.) For example, Promise Arizona claims that H.B. 2243’s List Maintenance \n15  Procedures will cause some of its members to “feel penalized.” (Id. 1321:8–1322:14) And \n16  if one of its members is removed from the voter rolls pursuant to H.B. 2243, Promise \n17  Arizona claims that members “would not have trust in the system.” (Id. 1322:21–1323:10.) \n18  Promise  Arizona  expects  to  prepare  its  field  organizers  and  volunteers  for  the \n19  implementation of H.B. 2243, which it anticipates will require new training on the effects \n20  of the law. (Id.  1320:21–1321:20, 1328:8–1329:20) Promise Arizona also anticipates \n21  redirecting the use of its staff members and volunteers to assist registrants who receive a \n22  notice  to  provide  DPOC  under  H.B.  2243.  (Id.  1318:24–1319:20,  1320:3–1321:20, \n23  1322:20–1323:3.) In addition, Promise Arizona plans to update its literature and its website \n24  to reflect the changes to Arizona’s voting laws. (Id. 1329:8–20.) \n25  5.  Arizona Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander for \n26  Equity Coalition \n27  Arizona Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander for Equity Coalition \n28  (“Equity Coalition”) is a statewide, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that strives for \n \n- 45 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  equity and justice on behalf of its AANHPI constituents. (Tiwamangkala Tr. 1265:11–23.) \n2  Equity  Coalition  pursues  its  mission  by  increasing  civic  engagement,  organizing \n3  communities, and developing young leaders. (Id. 1265:18–23.) Equity Coalition conducts \n4  its  voting-related  activities—which  include  voter  education,  registration,  and \n5  mobilization—through its Civic Engagement Program. (Id. 1265:1–2, 1267:21–1268:1.) \n6  Equity Coalition registers voters using digital and print advertisements, phone and text \n7  banking,  and  in  person  at  Asian  cultural  festivals,  Asian  businesses,  and  religious \n8  organizations. (Id. 1269:10–1270:3.) Equity Coalition also provides voter registration \n9  instructions in six AANHPI languages on its website. (Id. 1270:4–14.) \n10  At trial, Equity Coalition’s Advocacy Director Matine Tiwamangkala testified that \n11  after the Voting Laws were passed, Equity Coalition “had to take a pause” on its voter \n12  registration efforts to discern how the laws would impact the registration process. (Id. \n13  1274:12–18.) Equity Coalition hired a new employee to allow its “Democracy Defender \n14  Director” to focus on voting rights. (Id. 1281:2–17.) Equity Coalition claims the AANHPI \n15  community  is  fearful  of  H.B.  2243’s  List  Maintenance  Procedures  and  Cancellation \n16  Provision because some may be escaping government persecution. (Id. 1274:19–1275:3, \n17  1275:15–21.) Equity Coalition expects to retrain its canvassers, volunteers, subgrantees, \n18  and fellows on how to register voters and address these fears of the AANHPI community. \n19  (Id. 1275:15–1276:1) Equity Coalition also plans to expand the services of one of its \n20  subgrantees to assist voters who receive the 35-day notice and need to obtain DPOC. (Id. \n21  1275:16–23.)  In  addition,  the  organization  expects  to  update  the  voter  registration \n22  instructions on its website and translate each set of instructions, which costs 25 cents per \n23  word. (Id. 1270:18–21, 1275:16–1276:1.) Because Equity Coalition does not currently \n24  have the resources to complete these tasks, Equity Coalition plans to “shift [its] priorities” \n25  toward assisting the AANHPI community to obtain DPOC and educating its community \n26  members and volunteers about the effects of the Voting Laws. (Id. 1275:16–1276:19.) \n27  Equity Coalition claims that this shift in priorities will impact its other  initiatives—\n28  including the organization’s actual collection of voter registration forms—and will harm \n \n- 46 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  its mission. (Id. 1276:4–18.) Equity Coalition decided to reduce its voter registration goals \n2  in response to the Voting Laws, which it claims led to a decrease in the organization’s \n3  funding since its funding is “tied” to its registration goals. (Id. 1274:12–18, 1275:4–8, \n4  1278:20–1279:7.) \n5      6.  Poder Latinx \n6  Poder Latinx is an organization that aims to “engage the Latinx community to be \n7  civil  participants  through  their  vote.”  (Herrera  Tr.  1285:5–10.)  Poder  Latinx  serves \n8  marginalized communities, primarily “Black, Indigenous, people of color,” with a focus \n9  on the environment, economic justice, and immigration justice. (Id. 1285:11–16, 1285:24–\n10  1286:5.)  The organization’s elections-related work promotes voter engagement, voter \n11  participation, and voter protection. (Id. 1284:11–13, 1285:5–10.)  For example, Poder \n12  Latinx engages voters by canvassing in communities, translating election information, and \n13  conducting campaigns across multiple content mediums. (Id. 1286:6–14, 1286:6–1287:4.) \n14  Poder Latinx set a goal of registering 4,600 new voters in 2023 and seeks to register 9,000 \n15  new voters in 2024. (Id. 1286:19–23.) Poder Latinx plans to meet its registration goals by \n16  conducting outreach with on-the-ground canvassers and through social media, television, \n17  and radio. (Id. 1286:24–1287:4.) Poder Latinx calculates that it costs around $50 to register \n18  each individual voter. (Id. 1288:6–8.) \n19  Poder  Latinx  claims  that  the  Citizenship  Verification  Procedures  and  List \n20  Maintenance Procedures in H.B. 2492 and H.B. 2243 will remove qualified registered \n21  voters from the voter rolls and will unlawfully deny new voter applicants. (Id. 1290:4–15.) \n22  Poder Latinx also claims that naturalized citizens will be fearful of the database checks, \n23  which will make them less likely to participate in elections. (Id. 1290:16–1291:7.) Nancy \n24  Herrera, Poder Latinx’s Arizona State Program Director, testified that the Voting Laws’ \n25  database checks will harm the organization’s reputation, as community members who \n26  receive support from Poder Latinx and who are later removed from the voting rolls or \n27  denied registration will lose trust in the organization. (Id. 1300:23–1302:4.) To mitigate \n28  these anticipated effects, Poder Latinx claims it will need to “restructure” its “entire \n \n- 47 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  program” and allocate additional time and funding to its voter engagement efforts. (Id. \n2  1290:16–1291:12.) The organization plans to add additional canvassers, translate new \n3  voting materials, and contact community members who are removed from the voter rolls \n4  or those whose applications are denied. (Id. 1291:8–25, 1299:10–1300:20.) Poder Latinx \n5  also plans to conduct new campaigns utilizing social, digital, television, and print media, \n6  accounting for an anticipated increase in spending. (Id. 1300:6–22.) Poder Latinx estimates \n7  that these strategies will cost an additional $10 to $20 for each voter it registers or re-\n8  registers and expects to reallocate funding from its issue-based campaigns. (Id. 1299:10–\n9  1300:5, 1302:15–23.) It also anticipates that these additional costs will detract from the \n10  organization’s ability to register new voters. (Id. 1291:20–25.) \n11      7.  Chicanos Por La Causa \n12  Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) community development nonprofit \n13  organization with a mission to “empower[] lives” by engaging Latino communities in the \n14  political process. (Garcia Tr. 176:16–20, 178:24–179:5; Guzman Tr. 478:2–6, 16–21.) \n15  Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit advocacy organization that \n16  aims to support the mission of Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc. (Garcia Tr. 175:19–20, 177:18–\n17  22.) The core activities of Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc. and Chicanos Por La Causa Action \n18  Fund (collectively, “CPLC”) include helping eligible people to register to vote and follow \n19  up to make sure they actively vote, in part by targeting “low propensity voters” through its \n20  “Latino Loud” initiative. (Id. 179:6–22, 180:10–18; Guzman Tr. 478:22–479:17.) Joseph \n21  Garcia, vice president of public policy at Chicanos Por La Causa and executive director of \n22  Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund, testified that CPLC has a reputation as “a trusted \n23  name within the Latino community.” (Garcia Tr. 186:8–19; see also Guzman Tr. 485:20–\n24  486:3.)  \n25  CPLC claims that the Voting Laws’ Citizenship Verification Procedures and List \n26  Maintenance Procedures regarding voters lacking DPOC will have a chilling effect on \n27  voters in the Latino community. (Garcia Tr. 190:19–25, 199:14–200:16; Guzman Tr. \n28  480:9–481:18.) These new procedures would harm CPLC’s reputation if members of the \n \n- 48 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Latino  community  attribute  the  effects  of  the  Voting  Laws  to  CPLC’s  inability  to \n2  effectively register individuals to vote. (Garcia Tr. 191:1–7, 194:7–195:4, 206:24–207:15; \n3  Guzman Tr. 486:4–487:2.) During the 2022 midterm election cycle, CPLC registered \n4  37,000 new voters and spent $5.7 million on canvassing and registering people to vote. \n5  (Garcia Tr. 180:10–18, 203:4–8.) CPLC anticipates reallocating approximately 20 to 30% \n6  of its election budget specifically to address the effects of the Voting Laws on its voter \n7  programming by increasing its staffing to educate voters about the Voting Laws and \n8  assisting those who are removed from the voting rolls. (Garcia Tr. 191:8–194:6, 203:4–23, \n9  204:3–22.) \n10      8.  Arizona Coalition for Change \n11  Arizona  Coalition  for  Change  is  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit  organization  based  in \n12  Arizona, and its mission is to empower individuals in underserved communities to impact \n13  their community through civic engagement and collaboration. (Bolding Tr. 258:3–25.) \n14  Arizona  Coalition  for  Change  operates  in  Maricopa,  Pima,  and  Pinal  Counties  and \n15  primarily serves Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, women, and young people. \n16  (Id. 258:16–25.) Arizona Coalition for Change hosts leadership development programs for \n17  youth  and  college  students,  leads  community  organizing  efforts,  and  conducts  voter \n18  registration and voter education programs as part of its civic engagement activities. (Id. \n19  259:9–17, 265:8–11.) Arizona Coalition for Change registers voters by tabling at events \n20  and at “hot spots,” which are high-traffic locations such as grocery stores, libraries, and \n21  small businesses. (Id. 267:7–268:1, 268:15–25.) The organization staffs its registration \n22  drives  with  paid  staff  members  and  volunteers.  (Id.  261:9–12,  268:2–14.)  Arizona \n23  Coalition for Change also hosts voter education events to inform individuals about voting, \n24  changes to Arizona election law, and the various offices that are up for election. (Id. 260:3–\n25  261:8, 262:25–263:9.) Organizing, marketing, and hosting each voter education event \n26  requires, at a minimum, ten hours of labor. (Id. 261:13–25.) Arizona Coalition for Change \n27  also pays to advertise its voter education events through social media, digital, and print \n28  communications. (Id. 262:1–24.) \n \n- 49 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Arizona Coalition for Change claims that the Voting Laws will pose a “significant \n2  challenge” for individuals registering to vote. (Id. 265:4–17, 279:11–19.) For example, \n3  many individuals will incorrectly believe they are registered to vote when they are not. (Id. \n4  272:22–273:3.) Arizona Coalition for Change’s President Reginald Bolding testified that \n5  Arizona Coalition for Change plans to host new voter education events and create new, \n6  paid advertisements about the Voting Laws. (Id. 265:4–266:16.) Arizona Coalition for \n7  Change  also  expects  to  change  its  voter  registration  program  by  hiring  additional \n8  community organizers, implementing new training for its staff members and volunteers, \n9  and hosting “office hours” to assist community members with the registration process. (Id. \n10  270:20–273:17, 274:20–275:23.) Arizona Coalition for Change anticipates reallocating \n11  time and resources from its civil leadership development program to implement these new \n12  voter registration efforts. (Id. 273:25–274:18.) \n13      9.  Arizona Students’ Association \n14  Arizona Students’ Association (“ASA”) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization \n15  based in Arizona that advocates for affordable and accessible higher education for Arizona \n16  university and college students. (Nitschke Tr. 447:18–449:2.) ASA advances its mission \n17  by advocating at the state and local level, developing student leaders, and registering \n18  students to vote. (Id. 445:23–25, 447:18–449:2.) According to ASA, its members include \n19  all students at Arizona’s public universities, community colleges, and Grand Canyon \n20  University,  totaling  approximately  500,000  students.  (Id.  446:17–21.)  This  student \n21  population includes Latinos and naturalized citizens. (Id. 446:17–447:1.) ASA’s primary \n22  beneficiaries are its members, and ASA receives input from its members through polling \n23  and various on-campus events. (Id. 473:15–25.) \n24  ASA conducts its voter registration efforts through online platforms year-round and \n25  by tabling at various campus locations during the beginning of every fall semester. (Id. \n26  448:14–449:13.) Since the passage of the Voting Laws, ASA has spent time updating its \n27  training materials, conducting additional training for its volunteers and paid staff members, \n28  and following up with the organization’s Federal-Only Voters to ensure they become Full-\n \n- 50 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Ballot Voters. (Id. 452:4–23, 453:12–17.) ASA estimates that its regional organizers and \n2  executive staff have spent roughly 100 hours conducting the new trainings. (Id. 452:14–\n3  23, 453:12–17.) ASA also estimates that it has spent between $150 and $210 to provide \n4  updated training materials to its staff members and volunteers. (458:17–25, 467:20–467:6.) \n5  At trial, Kyle Nitschke, co-Executive Director for ASA, testified that the DPOR \n6  Requirement would impact ASA’s ability to help Federal-Only Voters on college campuses \n7  become Full-Ballot Voters, since many Federal-Only Voters do not have an in-state ID, a \n8  utility bill, or another form of DPOR. (Id. 453:18–454:8, 462:8–463:2.) ASA further claims \n9  that the DPOR requirement would require ASA to spend additional time checking each \n10  student’s application documents, which would “really slow down the registration process” \n11  and may lead to ASA turning away students who do not have readily accessible DPOR. \n12  (Id. 454:9–24.) ASA expects that it will continue to reallocate resources from its other \n13  initiatives, including its youth empowerment summit, to train its staff, pay for upgraded \n14  document scanning software to help students upload DPOR and DPOC, and check the voter \n15  database to determine the effect the Voting Laws are having on students. (Id. 456:8–457:7, \n16  458:9–16, 459:1–16., 460:20–461:5.) ASA also claims that students will choose not to \n17  register to vote for fear of H.B. 2492’s investigation procedures. (Id. 461:21–462:7.) \n18      10.  Democratic National Committee and Arizona Democratic Party \n19  The Democratic National Committee (“DNC”) is the national arm of the Democratic \n20  Party. (Reid Tr. 422:10–12.) The DNC coordinates the Democratic Party’s operations \n21  across all fifty states with the goal of electing Democrats “up and down the ballot,” \n22  including federal, state, and local offices in Arizona. (Id. 422:13–19, 24–25.) The DNC is \n23  comprised of formal voting members along with grassroots Democratic supporters. (Id. \n24  434:10–435:5.)  The  Arizona  Democratic  Party  (“ADP”)  is  the  operating  arm  of  the \n25  Democratic Party in Arizona. (Dick Tr. 508:1–3.) The ADP also works to elect Democrats \n26  in federal, state, and local elections in Arizona. (Id.) The ADP’s membership is comprised \n27  of  Democratic  voters  and  supporters.  (Id.  519:12–520:5.)  In  Arizona,  there  are \n28  approximately 1.26 million registered Democrats. (Id. 508:9–10.) The DNC and the ADP \n \n- 51 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  both work to persuade citizens to vote for Democratic candidates and help Democratic \n2  supporters register to vote and cast a ballot. (Id. 509:13–24; Reid Tr. 423:21–424:10.) \n3  At  trial,  Ramsey  Reid,  DNC’s  Director  of  States,  and  Morgan  Dick,  ADP’s \n4  Executive Director, both testified that H.B. 2492’s Criminal Investigation Procedures \n5  would  deter  Democratic  supporters  from  registering  to  vote  for  fear  of  potentially \n6  subjecting themselves or a family member to scrutiny by law enforcement or prosecution. \n7  (Reid Tr. 421:8–13, 430:1–23; Dick Tr. 506:25–507:4, 516:22–517:11.) As a result, Reid \n8  and Dick testified that these provisions would impact the ability of Democratic candidates \n9  to successfully compete in Arizona elections. (Reid Tr. 433:9–23, Dick Tr. 518:18–21.) To \n10  address the anticipated impact of H.B. 2492, the DNC is planning to reallocate resources \n11  from its work in other states to find new potential registrants and further train its staff and \n12  volunteers on how to communicate with potential voters about the Voting Laws. (Reid Tr. \n13  430:24–432:25.) The ADP is also planning reallocating resources from other endeavors to \n14  make up the “lost ground” of voters that the ADP could have registered and mobilized to \n15  vote. (Dick Tr. 517:12–518:8.) \n16      11.  Tribal Plaintiffs \n17  San Carlos Apache Tribe (“Tribe”) is a federally recognized Indian Tribe. (Pls.’ \n18  Stip. No. 1.) The San Carlos Apache Reservation (“Reservation”) spans across Gila, \n19  Graham, and Pinal Counties in southeastern Arizona and is the tenth largest reservation in \n20  the United States. (Id. Nos. 2, 4; Rambler Tr. 996:10–17.) Approximately 13,000 to 14,000 \n21  of the Tribe’s 17,300 members live on the Reservation. (Rambler Tr. 996:18–21.) Roughly \n22  half of the Tribe members that live on the Reservation are over sixty years old, and many \n23  of them speak Apache and are not fluent in English. (Id. 1005:16–23.) \n24  At trial, Tribe Chairman Terry Rambler testified that voting in federal, state, and \n25  local elections is very important to the Tribe and its members. (Id. 995:14–18, 1003:22–\n26  1004:19.) The Tribe claims that the DPOR Requirement would make it more difficult for \n27  Tribe members—especially those who are elderly and not fluent in English—to register to \n28  vote because the Reservation does not have a uniform mapping system. (Id. 999:24–\n \n- 52 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  1000:5, 1005:12–23, 1008:11–21.) For example, residences on the Reservation typically \n2  do not have street names or building numbers, and Tribe members receive mail at post \n3  office boxes on the Reservation. (Id. 996:22–997:4, 997:7–11.) Tribe identification cards \n4  list post office box numbers instead of residential addresses. (Id. 998:11–16.) In addition, \n5  not all Tribe members have an Arizona credential, and those Tribal members with Arizona \n6  credentials may list the nearest highway mile marker on their credential, as opposed to a \n7  residential address. (Id. 997:12–998:1, 999:10–12.) Some Tribe members, including those \n8  who  are  temporarily  living  with  a  family  member  or  those  who  are  experiencing \n9  homelessness, do not have a permanent residence.43 (Id. 998:17–22.) \n10  Tohono  O’odham  Nation  is  a  federally  recognized  Tribe.  (Pls.’  Stip.  No.  5.) \n11  According to the 2020 Census, approximately 6,713 voting-age individuals live on Tohono \n12  O’odham lands. (Id. No. 6.) Gila River Indian Community is a federally recognized Tribe. \n13  (Id. No. 7.) According to the 2020 Census, approximately 9,628 voting-age individuals live \n14  on the Gila River Reservation.44 (Id. No. 8.) \n15  II.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n16  The Court previously ruled on several of Plaintiffs’ claims in its Order addressing \n17  the parties’ motions for summary judgment. (See generally 09/14/2023 Order.) The parties \n18  presented evidence on the following remaining issues at trial: \n19  •  Whether the non-US Plaintiffs have standing to bring each of their claims.  \n20  •  Whether  H.B.  2492  § 4’s  Birthplace  Requirement  for  State  Form  users \n21  violates the Civil Rights Act (“CRA”), 52 U.S.C. § 10101, section 2 of the \n22  Voting  Rights  Act  (“VRA”),  52  U.S.C.  § 10301  et  seq.,  or  the  Equal \n23  Protection Clause, or imposes an undue burden on the right to vote. See \n24  A.R.S. § 16-121.01(A). \n25 \n \n43 The remaining “LUCHA Plaintiffs”—namely, Living United for Change in Arizona, \n26 \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, Arizona Democracy Resource Center Action, \nand Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.—did not present any evidence at trial regarding \n27 \ntheir standing to bring this action.  \n44 The remaining Tohono O’odham Plaintiffs—namely, Alanna Siquieros, Keanu Stevens, \n28 \nand LaDonna Jacket—did not provide any evidence at trial regarding their standing to bring \nthis action. \n \n- 53 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  •  Whether H.B. 2492 § 4’s citizenship verification and criminal investigation \n2  referral procedures for registrations lacking DPOC violates section 2 of the \n3  VRA, procedural due process, or the Equal Protection Clause, or imposes an \n4  undue burden on the right to vote. See § 16-121.01(D), (E). \n5  •  Whether H.B. 2492 § 5’s DPOR requirement for State Form users violates \n6  the NVRA or the Equal Protection Clause or imposes an undue burden on \n7  the right to vote. See § 16-123; see also § 16-121.01(A). \n8  •  Whether H.B. 2492 § 7’s referral, citizenship verification, and prosecution \n9  procedures for registered voters without DPOC violate the NVRA, section 2 \n10  of the VRA, or the Equal Protection Clause, or imposes an undue burden on \n11  the right to vote. See § 16-143. \n12  •  Whether  H.B.  2492  § 8’s  cancellation  of  a  voter  registration  upon \n13  “confirm[ing]” a person’s non-citizenship violates the NVRA, section 2 of \n14  the VRA, procedural due process, or the Equal Protection Clause, or imposes \n15  an undue burden on the right to vote. See § 16-165(A)(10), amended by H.B. \n16  2243 § 2.  \n17  •  Whether H.B. 2243 § 2’s citizenship verification, registration cancellation, \n18  and criminal investigation referral procedures violate the NVRA, section 2 \n19  of the VRA, procedural due process, the Equal Protection Clause, or imposes \n20  an undue burden on the right to vote. See § 16-165(A)(10), (G)–(K). \n21  •  Whether H.B. 2243 § 2’s Reason to Believe Provision violates the CRA, the \n22  NVRA, section 2 of the VRA, or the Equal Protection Clause See § 16-\n23  165(I). \n24  •  Whether the Voting Laws were enacted with a discriminatory intent. \n25  Under the principles of preemption, “when federal and state law conflict, federal \n26  law prevails and state law is preempted.” Knox v. Brnovich, 907 F.3d 1167, 1173 (9th Cir. \n27  2018) (quoting Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 584 U.S. 453, 471 (2018)). \n28  Because the Voting Laws have not yet been implemented, Plaintiffs are bringing a facial \n \n- 54 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  challenge to the Voting Laws’ legality. To succeed on a facial challenge, Plaintiffs must \n2  establish “that ‘no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.’” Puente \n3  Ariz. v. Arpaio, 821 F.3d 1098, 1104 (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746 \n4  (1987)).  The Court “must be careful not to go beyond the statute’s facial requirements and \n5  speculate about ‘hypothetical’ or ‘imaginary’ cases.” Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State \n6  Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 450 (2008). \n7  A.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \n8    1.  Standing  \n9  Defendants  argue  that  all  non-U.S.  Plaintiffs  lack  standing  because  non-U.S. \n10  Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their organizations, or a specific member of their \n11  organizations, will suffer an actual or imminent, concrete, and particularized injury due to \n12  any challenged provision of the Voting Laws. \n13  Under Article III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff has standing if it can \n14  show (1) an “injury in fact” that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not \n15  hypothetical; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; \n16  and (3) that it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed \n17  by a favorable decision. See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). In \n18  cases for prospective injunctive relief, “past wrongs do not in themselves amount to that \n19  real and immediate threat of injury necessary to make out a case or controversy.” City of \n20  Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 (1983). Rather, a plaintiff’s “standing to seek the \n21  injunction requested depend[s] on whether he [is] likely to suffer future injury.” Id. at 105. \n22  When addressing behavior that is alleged to increase the risk of future injury, the future \n23  injury must be “certainly impending.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013); \n24  see also Protectmarriage.com-Yes on 8 v. Bowen, 752 F.3d 827, 839 (9th Cir. 2014) \n25  (“Whether we view injury in fact as a question of standing or ripeness, ‘we consider \n26  whether the plaintiff[] face[s] a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of \n27  the  statute’s  operation  or  enforcement’”  (alterations  in  original)  (citation  omitted)); \n28  Common Cause Ind. v. Lawson, 937 F.3d 944, 950 (7th Cir. 2019) (“[O]rganizations may \n \n- 55 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  rely on not only actual, but imminent harm for standing, including by challenging laws pre-\n2  enforcement if the organization can show a substantial threat of injury.”). \n3  “Only one plaintiff needs to have standing when only injunctive relief is sought.” \n4  DNC v. Reagan, 329 F. Supp. 3d 824, 841 (D. Ariz. 2018) (citing Crawford v. Marion \n5  Cnty. Election Bd. (“Crawford I”), 472 F.3d 949, 951 (7th Cir. 2007)) (finding standing \n6  where Arizona Democratic Party and additional private plaintiffs requested injunctive and \n7  declaratory relief against Arizona election law), aff’d sub nom. DNC v. Hobbs, 9 F.4th \n8  1218, 1219 (9th Cir. 2021) (Mem.); Mecinas v. Hobbs, 30 F.4th 890, 897 (9th Cir. 2022) \n9  (“In a suit with multiple plaintiffs, generally only one plaintiff need have standing for the \n10  suit to proceed.”). However, at least one plaintiff must establish standing “for each claim \n11  for relief.” Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. \n12  2367, 2379 n.6 (2020). \n13  An organization can have direct standing by “claim[ing] that it suffered an injury in \n14  its  own  right”  or  representational  standing  by  asserting  “standing  solely  as  the \n15  representative of its members.” Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows \n16  of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 199 (2023) (citation omitted). “[A]n organization has direct \n17  standing to sue where it establishes that the defendant’s behavior has frustrated its mission \n18  and caused it to divert resources in response to that frustration of purpose.”  E. Bay \n19  Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 663 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Fair Hous. of \n20  Marin v. Combs, 285 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir. 2002)). Organizations cannot “manufacture \n21  the injury by incurring litigation costs,” but they can show standing when they “would have \n22  suffered some other injury had they not diverted resources to counteracting the problem.” \n23  Id. (internal quotations omitted). “The fact that the added cost has not been estimated and \n24  may be slight does not affect standing, which requires only a minimal showing of injury.” \n25  Crawford I, 472 F.3d at 951 (emphasis added), aff’d, 553 U.S. 181 (2008); see also See E. \n26  Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 993 F.3d at 664 (“Organizations are not required to demonstrate \n27  some threshold magnitude of their injuries . . . .”). \n28  To  invoke  representational  standing,  an  organization  must  show  that  “(a)  its \n \n- 56 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks \n2  to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor \n3  the relief  requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” \n4  Students for Fair Admissions, 600 U.S. at 199 (citation omitted). “Implicit in the first prong \n5  of this test is the requirement that an organization must generally have ‘members’ to bring \n6  suit on their behalf.” Or. Moms Union v. Brown, 540 F. Supp. 3d 1008, 1013 (D. Or. May \n7  20,  2021).  However,  a  non-membership  organization  may  also  have  representational \n8  standing if it possesses “indicia of membership” such that it is “sufficiently identified with \n9  and subject to the influence of those it seeks to represent as to have a ‘personal stake in the \n10  outcome of the controversy.’” Am. Unites for Kids v. Rousseau, 985 F.3d 1075, 1096 (9th \n11  Cir. 2021) (quoting Or. Advoc. Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1111 (9th Cir. 2003)). For \n12  example,  in  Oregon  Advocacy  Center  v.  Mink,  the  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  a  non-\n13  membership  organization  had  associational  standing  because  it  served  a  “specialized \n14  segment” of a community, who were the “primary beneficiaries” of the organization’s \n15  activities. 322 F.3d at 1111. \n16        i.  Challenges to the Birthplace Requirement \n17  Mi Familia Vota’s testimony demonstrates that the Birthplace Requirement poses a \n18  “substantial threat of injury,” which frustrates Mi Familia Vota’s mission and will require \n19  it to divert resources to counteract its effects, constituting an injury-in-fact. Common \n20  Cause, 937 F.3d at 950; see, e.g., Crawford I, 472 F.3d at 951 (“[T]he new law injures the \n21  Democratic Party by compelling the party to devote resources to getting to the polls those \n22  of its supporters who would otherwise be discouraged by the new law from bothering to \n23  vote.”); Arcia v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014) (“[O]rganizations \n24  can establish standing to challenge election laws by showing that they will have to divert \n25  personnel and time to educating potential voters on compliance with the laws and assisting \n26  voters who might be left off the registration rolls on Election Day.”); One Wis. Inst., Inc. \n27  v. Thomsen, 198 F. Supp. 3d 896, 909–10 (W.D. Wis. 2016) (finding that nonprofit \n28  plaintiffs had suffered an injury-in-fact where plaintiffs presented evidence that they \n \n- 57 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  “devoted money, staff time, and other resources away from their other priorities to educate \n2  voters about the new laws”), rev’d in part on other grounds sub nom. Luft v. Evers, 963 \n3  F.3d 665 (7th Cir. 2020). This injury is traceable to the Birthplace Requirement and \n4  redressable by the injunction sought by Mi Familia Vota. See Common Cause, 937 F.3d at \n5  950. \n6  Defendants argue that Mi Familia Vota has not identified any individual who is \n7  likely to be injured by the Birthplace Requirement. But to have standing based on a future \n8  injury, a plaintiff need not identify specific individuals who are likely to be harmed by the \n9  challenged conduct, so long as the future injury alleged is “certainly impending.” Clapper, \n10  568 U.S. at 409. Defendants further argue that Mi Familia Vota “cannot predict the \n11  financial impact” of  the Birthplace Requirement and that its anticipated expenses to \n12  counteract the provision are speculative. However, a plaintiff need not estimate the cost of \n13  their injury to demonstrate standing. See Crawford I, 472 F.3d at 951. The Court concludes \n14  that Mi Familia Vota has direct standing. \n15  ii.  Challenges  to  H.B.  2492’s  Citizenship  Verification \n16  Procedures and Criminal Investigation Procedures  \n17  The Court concludes that the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona \n18  Democratic Party have direct standing. The organizations’ testimony demonstrates that \n19  H.B. 2492’s Criminal Investigation Procedures pose a substantial threat of injury, which \n20  frustrates the DNC’s and the ADP’s missions and will require them to divert resources to \n21  respond to its effects. See Common Cause, 937 F.3d at 950; Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1341. The \n22  diversion-of-resources constitutes injuries-in-fact, which is traceable to the H.B. 2492’s \n23  Criminal Investigation Procedures and redressable by the injunctive relief sought by the \n24  DNC and the ADP. \n25  The Court also concludes that the Democratic National Committee and the Arizona \n26  Democratic Party have representational standing. First, the DNC’s and the ADP’s members \n27  would have standing to sue in their own right. Given the impending enforcement of the \n28  Voting Laws, both organizations’ members face a “realistic danger of sustaining a direct \n \n- 58 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  injury” due to H.B. 2492’s Criminal Investigation Procedures. Bowen, 752 F.3d at 839. \n2  This constitutes an injury-in-fact, which is traceable to H.B. 2492 and redressable by an \n3  injunction preventing their enforcement. Second, the DNC and the ADP seek to protect \n4  voting rights of its members, which is germane to the purposes of both organizations. And \n5  third, the organizations’ claims and requested relief do not require the participation of its \n6  members in this litigation. In addition, because it is “relatively clear” that at least one of \n7  each organization’s members will be impacted by H.B. 2492’s Criminal Investigation \n8  Procedures, and because defendants need not know the identity of any particular DNC or \n9  ADP member to respond to their claims, it is not necessary for the DNC or the ADP to \n10  identify any specific member who will be injured by the challenged provisions. Nat’l \n11  Council of La Raza v. Cegavske, 800 F.3d 1032, 1041 (9th Cir. 2015). \n12  In addition, Poder Latinx’s testimony demonstrates that H.B. 2492’s Citizenship \n13  Verification Procedures pose a substantial threat of injury, which frustrates Poder Latinx’s \n14  mission and will require it to divert resources to counteract its effects. See Common Cause, \n15  937 F.3d at 950; Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1341. This constitutes an injury-in-fact, which is \n16  traceable to H.B. 2492’s and H.B. 2243’s database checks and redressable by the injunctive \n17  relief sought by Poder Latinx. Defendants assert that the costs of increasing its community \n18  outreach efforts does not amount to injury-in-fact because informing voters about the \n19  electoral process is part of the organization’s “regular mission.” This argument is also \n20  misplaced, as an organization can have standing where it “diverts its resources to achieve \n21  its typical goal in a different or amplified manner.” Fair Fight Action, Inc. v. Raffensperger, \n22  634 F. Supp. 3d 1128, 1178 (N.D. Ga. 2022) (emphasis added).  The Court concludes that \n23  Poder Latinx has direct standing. \n24  Lastly,  Voto  Latino’s  testimony  demonstrates  that  H.B.  2492’s  Citizenship \n25  Verification Procedures and Criminal Investigation Procedures frustrate Voto Latino’s \n26  mission. As a result, Voto Latino has diverted and anticipates further diversion of resources \n27  to counteract its effects, which constitutes an injury-in-fact. See Crawford I, 472 F.3d at \n28  951.  This  injury  is  traceable  to  H.B.  2492’s  criminal  prosecution  procedures  and \n \n- 59 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  redressable by the injunctive relief sought by Voto Latino. Though Defendants argue that \n2  Voto Latino did not adduce evidence that the educational content it has created specifically \n3  addresses the bill’s prosecution procedures, the standing inquiry does not require such \n4  minute specificity. Rather, it is sufficient that Voto Latino presented evidence that it \n5  “devoted money, staff time, and other resources away from their other priorities to educate \n6  voters about the new laws.” One Wis. Inst., Inc., 198 F. Supp. 3d at 909–10. The Court \n7  concludes that Voto Latino has direct standing. \n8  iii.  Challenges  to  the  List  Maintenance  Procedures  and \n9  Cancellation Provision \n10  The Court concludes that Promise Arizona has direct standing to challenge H.B. \n11  2243’s List Maintenance Procedures and Cancellation Provision. H.B. 2243’s database \n12  checks and notice and investigation procedures pose a substantial threat of injury, which \n13  frustrates Promise Arizona’s mission and will require it to divert resources to counteract \n14  its effects. See Common Cause, 937 F.3d at 950; Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1341. This constitutes \n15  an  injury-in-fact,  which  is  traceable  to  H.B.  2243’s  database  checks  and  notice  and \n16  investigation  procedures  and  redressable  by  the  injunctive  relief  sought  by  Promise \n17  Arizona.  \n18  Promise  Arizona  also  has  representational  standing.  First,  Promise  Arizona’s \n19  members would have standing to sue in their own right. Given the impending enforcement \n20  of the Voting Laws, and because H.B. 2243’s database checks would apply to all registered \n21  voters in Arizona, Promise Arizona’s members face a “realistic danger of sustaining a \n22  direct injury” due to H.B. 2243. Bowen, 752 F.3d at 839 (see Connor Tr. 371:15–372:2 \n23  (testifying the Secretary of State will implement the Voting Laws); Petty Tr. 160:3–15 \n24  (testifying Maricopa County Recorder’s office will implement the Voting Laws).) This \n25  threat of future injury constitutes an injury-in-fact that is traceable to H.B. 2243 and \n26  redressable by an injunction preventing its enforcement. Second, Promise Arizona seeks to \n27  protect voting rights of its members, which is germane to the organization’s purpose. And \n28  lastly, Promise Arizona’s claim and requested relief do not require the participation of its \n \n- 60 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  members in this litigation. \n2  Defendants argue that Promise Arizona has not identified any specific member who \n3  has  been  or  is  likely  to  be  injured  by  H.B.  2243’s  database  checks  and  notice  and \n4  investigation  procedures.  However,  to  demonstrate  representational  standing,  an \n5  organization is not required to identify of any member who is or will be injured “[w]here \n6  it is relatively clear, rather than merely speculative, that one or more members have been \n7  or will be adversely affected by a defendant’s action,” and where the defendant does not \n8  need to know “the identity of a particular member to understand and respond to an \n9  organization’s claim of injury.” Nat’l Council of La Raza, 800 F.3d at 1041; see also Fla. \n10  State Conf. of N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1160 (11th Cir. 2008) (“When the \n11  alleged harm is prospective, we have not required that the organizational plaintiffs name \n12  names because every member faces a probability of harm in the near and definite future.”).  \n13  The Court also concludes that Equity Coalition, CPLC, and SVREP, and Poder \n14  Latinx  have  direct  standing.  Tiwamangkala’s,  Garcia’s,  Camarillo’s,  and  Herrera’s \n15  testimony demonstrates that H.B. 2243’s List Maintenance Procedures and Cancellation \n16  Provision pose a substantial threat of injury, which frustrates the organizations’ missions \n17  and will require the diversion of resources to respond to its effects. See Common Cause, \n18  937 F.3d at 950; Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1341. This constitutes an injury-in-fact, which is \n19  traceable to H.B. 2243 and is redressable by the injunctive relief. \n20  iv.  Challenges to the DPOR Requirement  \n21  The Court concludes that the San Carlos Apache Tribe has representational standing \n22  to challenge the DPOR Requirement. First, the Tribe’s members would have standing to \n23  sue in their own right. Given the impending enforcement of the Voting Laws, the Tribe’s \n24  members  face  a  “realistic  danger  of  sustaining  a  direct  injury”  due  to  the  DPOR \n25  Requirement. Bowen, 752 F.3d at 839. This constitutes an injury-in-fact, which is traceable \n26  to H.B. 2492 and redressable by an injunction preventing their enforcement. Second, the \n27  Tribe seeks to protect voting rights of its members, which is germane to the Tribe’s \n28  purpose. And third, the Tribe’s claim and requested relief do not require the participation \n \n- 61 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  of its members in this litigation. In addition, because it is “relatively clear” that at least one \n2  of  the  Tribe’s  members  will  be  impacted  by  the  DPOR  requirement,  and  because \n3  defendants need not know the identity of any particular Tribe member to respond to the \n4  Tribe’s claims, it is not necessary for the Tribe to identify any specific member who will \n5  be injured by the challenged provisions.45 Nat’l Council of La Raza, 800 F.3d at 1041.\n6    2.  Ripeness \n7  Defendants  argue  that  Plaintiffs’  claims  regarding  the  Voting  Laws  are \n8  constitutionally and prudentially unripe because Plaintiffs have not shown whether or how \n9  these provisions will be implemented, or how they will be affected by their implementation.  \n10  “[T]he ripeness inquiry contains both a constitutional and a prudential component.” \n11  Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000) (en \n12  banc) (citation omitted). Like the standing analysis, a claim is constitutionally ripe when \n13  “plaintiffs face ‘a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute’s \n14  operation or enforcement.’” Id. at 1139 (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat. \n15  Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)); see Coons v. Lew, 762 F.3d 891, 897 (9th Cir. 2014) \n16  (“When addressing the sufficiency of a showing of injury-in-fact grounded in potential \n17  future harms, . . . . the analysis for both standing and ripeness is essentially the same.” \n18  (citations omitted)), as amended (Sept. 2, 2014). Generally, Courts apply three factors to \n19  evaluate  whether  a  pre-enforcement  challenge  is  constitutionally  ripe:  (1)  whether \n20  “plaintiffs have articulated a concrete plan to violate the law in question,” (2) “whether the \n21  prosecuting  authorities  have  communicated  a  specific  warning  or  threat  to  initiate \n22  proceedings,” and (3) “the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged \n23  statute.” Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1138 (internal quotations and citation omitted). However, \n24  where the plaintiffs “are not the target of enforcement,” the Ninth Circuit has determined \n25  that “the familiar pre-enforcement analysis articulated in Thomas does not apply,” and has \n26 \n27 \n \n28  45 Because the Court finds that a Plaintiff has standing for each claim for relief, the Court \nneed not determine whether remaining Plaintiffs have standing. \n \n- 62 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  limited its ripeness analysis to the prudential component.46 San Luis & Delta-Mendota \n2  Water Auth. v. Salazar, 638 F.3d 1163, 1173 (9th Cir. 2011). In addition, the Ninth Circuit \n3  “appl[ies] the requirements of ripeness and standing less stringently in the context of First \n4  Amendment claims.” Twitter, Inc. v. Paxton, 56 F.4th 1170, 1174 (9th Cir. 2022). \n5    The Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claims are constitutionally ripe. The Voting \n6  Laws target individual voters, rendering the Thomas pre-enforcement factors inapplicable \n7  to nearly all Plaintiffs. See Salazar, 638 F.3d at 1173. Regardless, the organizational \n8  Plaintiffs have shown that Arizona’s enforcement of the Voting Laws will imminently \n9  harm their missions and/or their members. (See supra Section II(A)(1)); Bowen, 752 F.3d \n10  at 839 (pre-enforcement action is ripe “if the alleged injury is ‘reasonable’ and ‘imminent,’ \n11  and not merely ‘theoretically possible’” (citation omitted)). Defendants emphasize that the \n12  Voting Laws are not currently being enforced, it is unclear how the Voting Laws will be \n13  enforced, and that Plaintiffs have not proven that any person will be injured by the Voting \n14  Laws. But Ms. Connor testified that the Secretary of State will implement the Voting Laws \n15  once the Court determines their legality. (Connor Tr. 371:15–372:2.) And the county \n16  recorders  have  indicated  their  intent  to  implement  the  Voting  Laws  after  receiving \n17  guidance from the Secretary of State or the Court.47 (See, e.g., Petty Tr. 160:3–15; Ex. 111, \n18  at PX 111-3 to -5; Ex. 118, at PX 118-4 to -5; Ex. 121, at PX 121-2 to -3; see also Exs. \n19  123, 127, 136, 146, 151, 156, 174, 175.) Plaintiffs’ injuries are not just “theoretically \n20  possible,” but “imminent.” See Bowen, 752 F.3d at 839. \n21  The  Court  also  finds  that  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  prudentially  ripe.  A  claim  is \n22  prudentially ripe when “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to \n23  the parties of withholding court consideration” both weigh toward hearing the case. See \n24  Ass’n of Irritated Residents v. EPA, 10 F.4th 937, 944 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Abbott Labs. \n25  v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)). First, the issues are fit for review “because further \n \n26  46 The third pre-enforcement factor in Thomas—the history of past enforcement—is also \ninapplicable where, as here, the statutes at issue are new. See Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 \n27 \nF.3d 1045, 1060 (9th Cir. 2010). \n47 At least one county has already begun implementing certain provisions of the Voting \n28 \nLaws. (Doc. 679-2, Ex. 8, 30(b)(6) Dep. of Cochise County Recorder (“Cochise Dep.”) at \n26:16–27:10, 28:12–19, 30:8–18, 80:5–81:24; see also Exs. 507–510.) \n \n- 63 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  factual development would not ‘significantly advance [the Court’s] ability to deal with the \n2  legal issues presented.’” Salazar, 638 F.3d at 1173 (quoting Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. \n3  Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 804 (2003)). Second, as the Court previously ruled, \n4  “delaying review until after certain Plaintiffs have already been unlawfully removed from \n5  Arizona’s voting rolls and prevented from voting would make any review ‘too late to \n6  redress the injuries suffered by [Plaintiffs’] members.’” (Doc. 304, 02/16/2023 Order at 19 \n7  (quoting Ass’n of Irritated Residents, 10 F.4th at 944).) \n8  B.  Civil Rights Act \n9    Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  Birthplace  Requirement  and  the  Reason  to  Believe \n10  Provision violate the Civil Rights Act.  \n11    1.  Private Right Under the CRA  \n12  Defendants argue that § 10101 does not confer a private right, and alternatively, that \n13  non-U.S. Plaintiffs may not enforce § 10101 under § 1983. Section 10101 provides: \n14  (2) No person acting under color of law shall— \n  (A) in determining whether an individual is qualified under State law \n15  or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, practice, or procedure \ndifferent from the standards, practices, or procedures applied under such law \n16  or  laws  to  other  individuals  within  the  same  county,  parish,  or  similar \npolitical subdivision who have been found by State officials to be qualified \n17  to vote; \n  (B) deny the right of any individual to vote in any election because of \n18  an error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application, \nregistration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not \n19  material in determining whether such individual is qualified under State law \nto vote in such election[.] \n20 \n21  52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A)–(B). The statute does not expressly create a private right of \n22  action but empowers the U.S. Attorney General to bring “a civil action or other proper \n23  proceeding for preventive relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary \n24  injunction, restraining order, or other order.” § 10101(c). The Ninth Circuit has not decided \n25  whether private citizens may enforce § 10101, though the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits have \n26  found in the affirmative. Vote.Org v. Callanen, 89 F.4th 459, 473–76 (5th Cir. 2023) \n27  (finding federal right under § 10101(a)(1) and (a)(2)(B)); Schwier v. Cox, 340 F.3d 1284, \n28  1296 (11th Cir. 2003) (finding federal right under § 10101(a)(2)(B)); see also Davis v. \n \n- 64 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Commonwealth Election Comm’n, No.: 1-14-CV-00002, 2014 WL 2111065, at *9–10 (D. \n2  N. Mar. I. May 20, 2014); but see McKay v. Thompson, 226 F.3d 752, 756 (6th Cir. 2000) \n3  (finding no private right of action). \n4  To enforce § 10101 under § 1983, non-U.S. Plaintiffs must show that Congress \n5  intended to “‘unambiguously confer[]’ ‘individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries’ to \n6  which [Plaintiffs] belong[].” Health and Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. \n7  166, 183 (2023) (quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285–86 (2002)); see also \n8  Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 283–84 (applying implied right of action caselaw to analyze \n9  whether a statute confers a private federal right enforceable under § 1983). “‘[F]all[ing] \n10  within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to protect’ is not enough.” \n11  All. of Nonprofits for Ins., Risk Retention Grp. v. Kipper, 712 F.3d 1316, 1326 (9th Cir. \n12  2013) (second alteration in original) (quoting Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 283). If a statute \n13  confers a federal right, that right is “presumptively enforceable” under § 1983 because \n14  “§ 1983 generally supplies a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal \n15  statutes.” Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 284; see 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (providing remedy for the \n16  deprivation of “rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws” of \n17  the United States).  \n18  i.  Section 10101 Confers a Federal Private Right \n19  When determining whether a statute creates an enforceable federal right, the Court \n20  “considers whether the statute: (1) is intended to benefit a class of individuals of which the \n21  Plaintiff is a member; (2) sets forth a standard, clarifying the nature of the right, that makes \n22  the right capable of enforcement by the judiciary; and (3) is mandatory, rather than \n23  precatory in nature.” Crowley v. Nevada ex rel. Nev. Sec’y of State, 678 F.3d 730, 735 (9th \n24  Cir. 2012) (citing Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340–41 (1997)). \n25  The  Court  agrees  with  the  courts  that  have  found  a  federal  right  under  the \n26  “Materiality Provision,” under which “[n]o person acting under color of law shall . . . deny \n27  the right of any individual to vote in any election.” § 10101(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added); \n28  see, e.g., Schwier, 340 F.3d at 1296; Davis, 2014 WL 2111065, at *10. First, “[t]he subject \n \n- 65 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  of the sentence is the person acting under color of state law, but the focus of the text is \n2  nonetheless the protection of each individual’s right to vote.” Schwier, 340 F.3d at 1296; \n3  see also Talevski, 599 U.S. at 185 (“[I]t would be strange to hold that a statutory provision \n4  fails to secure rights simply because it considers, alongside the rights bearers, the actors \n5  that might threaten those rights (and we have never so held).”); Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. \n6  at 284 (explaining statutes “phrased ‘with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class’” \n7  have been found to create private rights (quoting Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, \n8  691 (1979)) (emphasis omitted)). For example, Gonzaga University cited Title VI of the \n9  Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the Education Amendments as examples of clear rights-\n10  creating language, which provide that “[n]o person in the United States shall . . . be \n11  subjected to discrimination.” 536 U.S. at 284 n.3 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000d and 20 U.S.C. \n12  § 1681(a)).  The  Materiality  Provision  is  similar.  Second,  the  Materiality  Provision \n13  specifically and unambiguously protects an individual’s right to vote notwithstanding an \n14  immaterial error or omission on her voter registration, which courts are readily capable of \n15  enforcing. See Schwier, 340 F.3d at 12696–97. And lastly, the Materiality Provision is \n16  mandatory, rather than precatory: “[n]o person acting under color of law shall . . . deny the \n17  right of any individual to vote.” § 10101(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). \n18  The Court is unaware of any case analyzing whether § 10101(a)(2)(A) also creates \n19  a federal right, under which “[n]o person acting under color of law shall . . . in determining \n20  whether any individual is qualified under State law or laws to vote” apply any standard or \n21  procedure  different  than  those  standards  or  procedures  applied  to  individuals  found \n22  qualified to vote (“Different Practices Provision”). Like the Materiality Provision, “[t]he \n23  subject of the sentence is the person acting under color of state law,” but the Different \n24  Practices Provision does not contain similarly clear and “paradigmatic rights-creating \n25  language.” Schwier, 340 F.3d at 1296; Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir. \n26  2005) (citing Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 287). However, the Ninth Circuit has instructed \n27  that a court “should not be limited to looking for those precise phrases” and may consider \n28  “other indicia so unambiguous that [it is] left without any doubt that Congress intended to \n \n- 66 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  create an individual, enforceable right.” Ball v. Rodgers, 492 F.3d 1094, 1106 (9th Cir. \n2  2007) (quoting Sanchez, 416 F.3d at 1058).  \n3  Here, by use of the term “shall,” the Different Practices Provision mandates that \n4  Arizona  officials  refrain  from  applying  differential  standards  or  procedures  to  “any \n5  individual.” Section 10101(a)(2)(A) does not have an “‘aggregate’ focus” or “speak only \n6  in terms of institutional policy and practice,” but unambiguously benefits a specific class \n7  of individuals. See Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 288 (first quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at \n8  343). And “no gap exists” between the provision’s proscribed conduct “and the persons \n9  whose interests are at stake”: any individual seeking to vote. Colon-Marrero v. Valez, 813 \n10  F.3d  1,  19  (1st  Cir.  2016);  compare  id.  (finding  enforceable  right  under  HAVA \n11  § 303(a)(4)(A), because its “proscription—‘no registrant may be removed’ [from the voter \n12  rolls]—directly  and  explicitly  protects  individual  voters”  (quoting  52  U.S.C. \n13  § 21083(a)(4)(A))), with Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 287–91 (finding no private right in \n14  the Family Educations Rights and Privacy Act, because the provision’s prohibition on \n15  providing funds to any educational institution with a policy of releasing education records \n16  without parental consent  “is two steps removed from the interests of individual students \n17  and parents”). Finally, forbidding state actors from applying any different “standard, \n18  practice, or procedure” to determine if an individual is qualified to vote is “not so ‘vague \n19  and amorphous’ that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.” Blessing, 520 U.S. \n20  at 340–41) (citation omitted). The Court finds that § 10101(a)(2)(A) creates a private right. \n21  Defendants contend that non-U.S. Plaintiffs may not enforce § 10101 because the \n22  statute is not intended to benefit organizations, which are unable to vote. A party generally \n23  may assert only “his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on \n24  the legal rights or interests of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975). But \n25  so long as the Court has subject matter jurisdiction, there may be circumstances in which \n26  a plaintiff may rest its claim on the legal rights of another. Id. at 500–01. The Fifth Circuit \n27  recently  concluded  that  an  organization  with  organizational  standing  could  assert \n28  individual voters’ rights under the Materiality Provision. Vote.Org, 89 F.4th at 471–73. \n \n- 67 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Specifically, the organization Vote.org could assert § 10101 claims of voters because \n2  “Vote.org’s position as a vendor and voting rights organization is sufficient to confer third-\n3  party standing.” Id. at 472; see also La Union del Pueblo Entero v. Abbott, 618 F. Supp. \n4  3d 388, 431–32 (W.D. Tex. 2022) (“LUPE I”) (finding organizational plaintiffs could \n5  enforce § 10101); Tex. Democratic Party v. Hughs, 474 F. Supp. 3d 849, 858 (W.D. Tex. \n6  2020) (holding that organizational plaintiffs could sue under § 1983 for violations of \n7  § 10101 because “[t]he same facts that establish organizational and associational standing \n8  . . . also demonstrate standing to sue for voting rights violations under [§ 10101]”), rev’d \n9  and remanded on other grounds, 860 F. App’x 874 (5th Cir. 2021). The Court concludes \n10  that non-U.S. Plaintiffs may similarly assert the rights of Arizona voters under the CRA. \n11  ii.  Plaintiffs May Enforce § 10101 Under § 1983 \n12  Because § 10101 creates a federal right, Plaintiffs may presumably enforce the \n13  provisions of § 10101 under § 1983. Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 283–84. Defendants may \n14  rebut this presumption by showing that “Congress shut the door to private enforcement \n15  either expressly, through specific evidence from the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating \n16  a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement \n17  under § 1983.” Id. at 284 n.4 (citations and internal quotations omitted); see Talevski, 599 \n18  U.S. at 187. The text of § 10101 does not explicitly preclude a § 1983 remedy, so the \n19  question  is  whether  Congress  created  a  comprehensive  enforcement  mechanism \n20  incompatible with enforcement under § 1983. Migliori v. Cohen, 36 F.4th 153, 160–61 (3d \n21  Cir. 2022), cert. granted, judgment vacated sub nom. Ritter v. Migliori, 143 S. Ct. 297 \n22  (2022).48 A remedy under § 1983 is foreclosed “when Congress creates a right by enacting \n23  a statute but at the same time limits enforcement of that right through a specific remedial \n24  scheme that is narrower than § 1983.” Stilwell v. City of Williams, 831 F.3d 1234, 1244 \n25  (9th Cir. 2016).  \n \n26  48 A vacated decision may still be considered for its persuasive effect. See Orhorhaghe v. \nI.N.S., 38 F.3d 488, 493 n.4 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing as persuasive authority a decision \n27 \nvacated by the Supreme Court as moot); In re Taffi, 68 F.3d 306, 310 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing \nas persuasive authority a decision vacated by the Supreme Court on other grounds). Though \n28 \nthe Supreme Court vacated Milgori as moot, this did not disrupt the Third Circuit’s \nunderlying analysis of § 10101.  \n \n- 68 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Section 10101 does not include a comprehensive enforcement scheme incompatible \n2  with enforcement under § 1983. First, district courts have jurisdiction over “proceedings \n3  instituted pursuant to [§ 10101] and shall exercise the same without regard to whether the \n4  party aggrieved shall have exhausted any administrative or other remedies that may be \n5  provided by law.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(d) (emphasis added). Schwier explained that because \n6  private citizens sued to enforce § 10101 before Congress granted the Attorney General \n7  authority to initiate an action in 1957, “this language could not have applied to the Attorney \n8  General and thus was meant to remove roadblocks for the previously authorized private \n9  rights of action.”49 340 F.3d at 1295–96 (cleaned up); see also Migliori, 36 F.4th at 160 \n10  (explaining that § 10101(d) “specifically contemplates an aggrieved party (i.e., private \n11  plaintiff) bringing this type of claim in court”); H.R. Rep. No. 85-291 (1957). And when \n12  Congress amended § 10101 authorizing the Attorney General to enforce the statute, it did \n13  so as a “means of further securing and protecting the civil rights of persons within the \n14  jurisdiction of the United States.” H.R. Rep. No. 85-291, at 1966 (1957) (emphasis added). \n15  This “demonstrates an intense focus on protecting the right to vote and does not support \n16  the  conclusion  that  Congress  meant  merely  to  substitute  one  form  of  protection  for \n17  another.”50 Schwier, 340 F.3d at 1295 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 85-291).  \n18  In  addition,  § 10101  lacks  the  “panoply  of  enforcement  options,  including \n19 \n \n49 Though several district courts and the Sixth Circuit have found no federal right under \n20 \n§ 10101, the Schwier Court noted that these decisions rely almost exclusively on Good v. \nRoy, which concluded, without elaboration, that the “unambiguous language” of § 10101  \n21 \nprecluded the court from implying a private right of action because “subsection (c) provides \nfor enforcement of the statute by the Attorney General with no mention of enforcement by \n22 \nprivate persons.” Schwier, 340 F.3d at 1294 (quoting Good, 459 F. Supp. 403, 405–06 (D. \nKan. 1978)); see McKay, 226 F.3d at 756 (citing Willing v. Lake Orion Cmty. Schs. Bd. of \n23 \nTrs., 924 F. Supp. 815, 820 (E.D. Mich. 1996)); Willing, 924 F. Supp at 820 (citing Good, \n459 F. Supp. at 405). Defendants cite to Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless v. \n24 \nHusted, for further support, but there a panel of the Sixth Circuit only noted that McKay \nremained binding in the absence of any Sixth Circuit en banc or Supreme Court decision \n25 \nholding to the contrary. 837 F.3d 612, 630 (6th Cir. 2016).  \n50 The Attorney General’s potential enforcement of § 10101 in and of itself does not \n26 \nforeclose a private remedy. See Schwier, 340 F.3d at 1294–95 (citing Allen v. State Bd. of \nElections, 393 U.S. 544, 556–57 (1969) (holding enforcement by the Attorney General did \n27 \nnot preclude private citizens from enforcing section 12(f) of the VRA and noting that the \ngoals of the VRA “could be severely hampered . . . if each citizen were required to depend \n28 \nsolely on litigation instituted at the discretion of the Attorney General”)); Migliori, 36 F.4th \nat 162 (noting that § 10101(d) does not mandate enforcement by the Attorney General). \n \n- 69 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  noncompliance  orders,  civil  suits,  .  .  .  criminal  penalties,”  and  “several”  private \n2  enforcement options that are characteristic of statutory remedies found incompatible with \n3  § 1983. Migliori, 36 F.4th at 161 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 347). And though “any \n4  person of such race or color” may apply for “an order declaring him qualified to vote” if \n5  the court finds a “pattern or practice” of § 10101 violations, this entitlement to a judicial \n6  determination merely “complement[s], rather than supplant[s], § 1983.” § 10101(e); Isabel \n7  v. Reagan, 394 F. Supp. 3d 966, 977 (D. Ariz. 2019) (quoting City of Rancho Palos Verdes \n8  v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 (2005)) (finding plaintiff must sue directly under the NVRA \n9  instead of § 1983 because, among other things, the NVRA creates an express private right \n10  of action that requires a plaintiff to first give notice of a violation and explicitly allows only \n11  declaratory and injunctive relief, while § 1983 lacks any notice requirement and allows \n12  suits for damages). The Court finds that Defendants have failed to rebut the presumption \n13  of an enforceable right under § 1983. Non-US Plaintiffs may enforce the rights conferred \n14  by § 10101 pursuant to § 1983.   \n15      2.  H.B. 2492 § 4’s Birthplace Requirement \n16    Plaintiffs claim that the Birthplace Requirement violates the Materiality Provision \n17  of the Civil Rights Act. See § 10101(a)(2)(B). The Materiality Provision prohibits the State \n18  from denying an individual her right to vote “because of an error or omission on any record \n19  or paper relating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such \n20  error or omission is not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under \n21  State law to vote in such election.” Id. The Materiality Provision was “intended to address \n22  the practice of requiring unnecessary information for voter registration with the intent that \n23  such requirements would increase the number of errors or omissions on the application \n24  forms, thus providing an excuse to disqualify potential voters.” Schwier, 340 F.3d at 1294.  \n25  Defendants do not dispute that an applicant’s failure to include her birthplace is an \n26  “error  or  omission  on  any  record  or  paper  relating  to”  a  requisite  to  voting.  See \n27  § 10101(a)(2)(B). And Arizona’s refusal to register an individual who omits birthplace is \n28  a denial of that individual’s right to vote. The question is whether an individual’s failure to \n \n- 70 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  provide birthplace is material to determining that individual’s eligibility to vote. To vote \n2  in Arizona, a person must be a United States citizen, a resident of Arizona, and at least \n3  eighteen years of age, who has not been adjudicated incapacitated or convicted of a felony. \n4  Ariz. Const. art. VII, § 2; see also A.R.S. § 16-121. An individual’s birthplace cannot be \n5  used to directly verify that individual’s citizenship or place of residence. (See, e.g., Connor \n6  Tr. 311:22–312:17; County Recorder Testimony Stip. No. 1.) Instead, Defendants claim \n7  that the Birthplace Requirement can be used to verify an individual’s identity, which is an \n8  integral component of determining eligibility.  \n9  Materiality “signifies different degrees of importance in different legal contexts.” \n10  Fla. State Conf. of N.A.A.C.P., 522 F.3d at 1173. The Court previously determined that \n11  Congress  intended  materiality  to  require  “some  probability  of  actually  impacting  an \n12  election official’s” determination of a person’s eligibility to vote. (09/14/2023 Order at 26.) \n13  The erroneous or omitted information need not be essential to determining a person’s \n14  eligibility to vote, but it must be more than useful or minimally relevant. (See id. at 25–\n15  26). \n16  The Court concludes that an individual’s birthplace is not material to determining \n17  her eligibility to vote. First, H.B. 2492 § 4 is not retroactive, meaning approximately one-\n18  third of current voter registrations will lack the voter’s birthplace until that voter submits a \n19  new  registration  while  an  additional  200,000  registrations  will  continue  to  identify \n20  birthplace generally as the United States. That Arizona has determined these voters are \n21  qualified  to  vote  notwithstanding  the  lack  of  any  meaningful  birthplace  information \n22  strongly indicates birthplace is immaterial. Moreover, the Voting Laws do not mandate \n23  county recorders to verify an individual’s birthplace or reject State Forms with an incorrect \n24  birthplace. See § 16-121.01(A); (Petty Tr. 103:21–104:5; Connor Tr. 316:3–6, 326:13–16.) \n25  “If the substance of the [birthplace field] does not matter, then it is hard to understand how \n26  one could claim that this requirement has any use in determining a voter’s qualifications.” \n27  Migliori, 36 F.4th at 164 (finding omitting the date on a ballot immaterial in part because \n28  “ballots were only to be set aside if the date was missing—not incorrect” (emphasis in \n \n- 71 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  original)). And HAVA Checks do not use birthplace as matching criteria for AVID and \n2  MVD records to verify an applicant’s identity for voter eligibility.  (Petty Tr. 32:19–33:14, \n3  103:2–7; see generally MVD Verification Criteria.)  \n4  Nor does the fact that Arizona can use birthplace for other administrative purposes \n5  render  birthplace  material  in  determining  a  voter’s  eligibility.  Specifically,  county \n6  recorders’ use of birthplace as one of several security questions to verify the identity of a \n7  registered voter does not make birthplace material because that voter has already been \n8  identified and found eligible to vote. (See, e.g., 2023 EPM at ECF-70 (including field for \n9  birthplace on ballot-by-mail request form,), ECF-229 (using birthplace to verify caller \n10  inquiring about status of provisional ballot).) “Once election officials have determined an \n11  applicant or voter’s identity, additional requirements that confirm identity are not material \n12  to determining whether the applicant or voter is qualified to vote or vote by mail and \n13  compounds the chance for error and disenfranchisement.” La Union del Pueblo Entero v. \n14  Abbott, 5:21-CV-0844-XR, 2023 WL 8263348, at *18 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 29, 2023) (“LUPE \n15  II”); see Martin v. Crittenden, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1302, 1309 (N.D. Ga. 2018) (“[W]ith respect \n16  to the absentee ballots rejected solely on a year of birth error or omission . . . the \n17  qualifications of the absentee voters are not at issue because . . . election officials have \n18  already  confirmed  such  voters’  eligibility  through  the  absentee  ballot  application \n19  process.”). And the evidence indicates that county recorders can nevertheless reliably \n20  verify the identity of  registered  voters without birthplace when necessary, especially \n21  considering the one-third of all voters who have never provided birthplace information \n22  when registering to vote. (See, e.g., Petty Tr. 168:1–12 (explaining Maricopa County \n23  accepts registration deficiency notices without birthplace information); Hiser Tr. 2056:18–\n24  2057:10 (explaining birthplace alone is insufficient to verify a voter’s identity via phone).) \n25    The  Court  concludes  that  the  Birthplace  Requirement  violates  the  Materiality \n26  Provision of the Civil Rights Act.  \n27  3.  H.B. 2243 § 2’s Reason to Believe Provision  \n28    Plaintiffs claim that H.B. 2243’s Reason to Believe Provision will cause county \n \n- 72 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  recorders to apply different standards, practices, and procedures to voters who county \n2  recorders suspect lack U.S. citizenship than those standards, practices, and procedures \n3  applied to voters not suspected of lacking citizenship. See § 10101(a)(2)(A). Specifically, \n4  H.B. 2243 requires county recorders to search SAVE only for naturalized voters who \n5  county recorders suspect are not U.S. citizens. See § 16-165(I).  \n6    While the Voting Laws purport to confirm the citizenship status of all voters, \n7  because SAVE requires an immigration number, county recorders can only ever conduct \n8  SAVE checks on naturalized citizens who county recorders have “reason to believe” are \n9  non-citizens. Naturalized citizens will always be at risk of county recorders’ subjective \n10  decision to further investigate these voters’ citizenship status, whereas the Reason to \n11  Believe Provision will never apply to native-born citizens. This violates the Different \n12  Practices Provision. C.f. U.S. Student Ass’n Found. v. Land, 585 F. Supp. 2d 925, 949–50 \n13  (E.D. Mich. 2008) (“[The Different Practices Provision] simply requires that if Michigan \n14  wishes to impose unique procedural requirements on the basis of a registrant’s original \n15  voter ID being returned as undeliverable, it must impose those requirements on everyone \n16  whose  original  ID  is  returned  as  undeliverable.”  (emphasis  in  original));  Frazier  v. \n17  Callicutt, 383 F. Supp. 15, 18–19 (N.D. Miss. 1974) (finding violation of § 10101 where \n18  registrar summarily referred the registration of every Black student whose registration may \n19  have indicated lack of residency to the board of election commissioners for appeal but \n20  approved nearly all non-student registrations that similarly indicated lack of residency); \n21  Shivelhood v. Davis, 336 F. Supp. 1111, 1115 (D. Vmt. 1971) (explaining that “the Board \n22  of Civil Authority must use its best efforts to insure that any questionnaire [concerning \n23  domicile] is equally relevant to all applicants and not designed only to apply to student \n24  applicants” in order to comply with § 10101(a)(2)(A)); see also Whatley v. Clark, 482 F.2d \n25  1230,  1232–33  (5th  Cir.  1973)  (finding  equal  protection  violation  where  Texas  law \n26  requiring residency was substantively the same for all voters but applied differently to \n27  students by creating a presumption of non-residency for students). \n28  Arizona is entitled to investigate the citizenship status of registered voters to ensure \n \n- 73 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  that only qualified individuals are registered to vote. Holding otherwise “would raise \n2  serious constitutional doubts if [the Different Practices Provision] precluded a State from \n3  obtaining the information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications.” ITCA, 570 U.S. at \n4  17. For example, County recorders must check SAVE and/or NAPHSIS for all voters \n5  without DPOC, i.e., Federal-Only Voters. § 16-165(I), (J). But because the application of \n6  H.B. 2243’s Reason to Believe Provision subjects only naturalized citizens to database \n7  checks, this provision violates § 10101. \n8    C.  National Voter Registration Act \n9  1.  Sections 6 and 7 of the NVRA \n10  i.  H.B. 2492 § 5’s DPOR Requirement \n11  The Court previously ruled that section 6 of the NVRA preempts H.B. 2492 § 5’s \n12  requirement that Federal Form users submit DPOR to register for federal elections. (See \n13  09/14/2023 Order at 9.) Plaintiffs claim that the DPOR Requirement violates section 6 of \n14  the NVRA to the extent that Arizona must accept Federal Forms lacking DPOR under the \n15  Court’s summary judgment ruling but will continue to reject State Forms lacking DPOR \n16  and refuse to register otherwise eligible voters for federal elections.  \n17  Section 6 of the NVRA permits Arizona to register eligible voters for federal \n18  elections with a State Form that “meets all of the criteria stated in” section 9 of the NVRA. \n19  52 U.S.C. 20505(a)(2). Specifically, as stated in section 9 of the NVRA, the State Form \n20  “may require only such identifying information . . . and other information . . . as is \n21  necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the \n22  applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process.” Id. \n23  § 20508(b)(1). Though the State Form “may require information the Federal Form does \n24  not,” Arizona must abide by section 6 and section 9 and show that the information required \n25  on the State Form is “necessary” to determine the eligibility of the applicant.51 ITCA, 570 \n26   \n51 In Fish v. Kobach (“Fish I”), the Tenth Circuit analyzed the necessity of information \n27  under section 5 of the NVRA, which requires states to include a voter registration as part \nof the application process for state driver’s licenses and identifications. 840 F.3d 710, 733–\n28  39  (10th  Cir.  2016).  This  registration  “may  require  only  the  minimum  amount  of \n \n \n- 74 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  U.S. at 12, 18; §§ 20505(a)(2), 20508(b). \n2  Defendants failed to do so. In fact, the Voting Laws indicate otherwise, as voters \n3  who obtain an out-of-state license or identification and receive a notice from the county \n4  recorder requesting confirmation of residency must only attest under penalty of perjury that \n5  the voter is still a resident of Arizona. § 16-165(E). The Court cannot reconcile why DPOR \n6  would be necessary for new applicants when an attestation is sufficient to determine the \n7  eligibility of registered voters who subsequently obtain an out-of-state identification. \n8  Section 6 of the NVRA preempts the DPOR Requirement as to State Form users for federal \n9  elections.  \n10  Plaintiffs also claim that Arizona’s differential treatment of State Form and Federal \n11  Form applications lacking DPOR violates section 7 of the NVRA, which requires public \n12  assistance agencies to distribute the Federal Form or an “equivalent” form. 52 U.S.C. \n13  § 20506(a)(6) (citing § 20508(a)(2)); Id. § 20506(a)(2). The Secretary of State supplies \n14  public assistance agencies with the State Form to register individuals. The “plain meaning \n15  of a statute controls where that meaning is unambiguous.” Khatib v. County of Orange, \n16  639 F.3d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc). Section 7 is clear: if the Secretary of State \n17  supplies the State Form to public assistance agencies, the State Form must be “equivalent,” \n18  or “virtually identical” to the Federal Form. Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) \n19  (defining equivalent as “equal in value, force, amount, effect, or significance,” or “virtually \n20  identical”).  \n21  Moreover, the Court does “not look at individual subsections in isolation” but reads \n22  “words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.” \n23  Tovar v. Sessions, 882 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir. 2018); id. (quoting King v. Burwell, 576 \n24  U.S. 473, 486 (2015)). As discussed above, states may develop “a mail voter registration \n25 \n \ninformation  necessary”  to  determine  the  applicant’s  eligibility.  52  U.S.C.  § 20504(c) \n26 \n(emphasis added). The Fish I Court held “that section 5’s ‘only the minimum amount of \ninformation necessary’ is a stricter principle than section 9’s ‘such identifying information \n27 \n. . . as is necessary’” and that the information enumerated in section 5 is the “presumptive \nminimum” a state may require. 840 F.3d at 734. Assuming section 9 is an easier standard \n28 \nthan section 5, the Court concludes that Defendants must still show the information on the \nState Form is necessary.  \n \n- 75 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  form that meets all of the criteria stated in section [9]” which allows states to include \n2  information necessary to determining voter eligibility that may not otherwise be on the \n3  Federal Form. §§ 20505(a)(2) (emphasis added), 20508(b)(1). By its terms, section 7 does \n4  not afford states this same discretion regarding forms made available at public assistance \n5  agencies. § 20506(a)(6). This is buttressed  by the fact that Congress  required public \n6  assistance agencies to provide voter registration services specifically in an effort to target \n7  the registration of persons with disabilities and low-income individuals who are more likely \n8  to receive public assistance. H.R. Rep. No. 103-66, 19 (1993) (Conf. Rep.). Requiring \n9  public assistance agencies to use an “equivalent” to the Federal Form “guarantees that a \n10  simple  means of registering to vote in federal elections will be available” for these \n11  individuals. ITCA, 570 U.S. at 12. Because the Voting Laws require a State Form to include \n12  DPOR, the State Form is not “equivalent” to the Federal Form. Arizona may not reject \n13  State Forms lacking DPOR and must register these applicants as Federal-Only Voters. \n14  ii.  H.B.  2243  § 2’s  List  Maintenance  Procedures  and \n15  Cancellation Provision \n16  Section 6 of the NVRA also mandates that states “accept and use” the Federal Form \n17  “for the registration of voters” for federal elections. § 20505(a). The Federal Form requires \n18  that applicants attest under penalty of perjury that they are eligible to vote, which includes \n19  being a U.S. citizen.  (See  Federal Form.)  The Court previously ruled that  section 6 \n20  preempts H.B. 2492 § 5, which requires Federal Form users to provide DPOC to vote in \n21  presidential elections and vote by mail. (09/14/2023 Order at 9–14.) Plaintiffs claim that \n22  section 6’s “accept and use” mandate also preempts H.B. 2243 § 2. Specifically, the \n23  Secretary of State and county recorders must conduct monthly database checks to verify \n24  the citizenship of voters who do not provide DPOC, namely, Federal-Only Voters. See \n25  § 16-165(I), (J). If the country recorder “confirms” that the voter is a non-citizen, the voter \n26  must then provide DPOC to avoid having her voter registration cancelled. § 16-165(A)(10). \n27  Plaintiffs claim that Arizona is not “using” the Federal Form because this regime requires \n28  county recorders to investigate and confirm a Federal-Only Voter’s citizenship status with \n \n- 76 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  information not contained on the Federal Form. \n2  H.B. 2243 § 2 does not violate section 6 of the NVRA. ITCA held that section 6’s \n3  “accept and use” mandate preempted Arizona’s DPOC requirement for Federal Form users. \n4  570 U.S. at 4, 15. The Supreme Court rejected Arizona’s argument that section 6 only \n5  required Arizona to “receive the [Federal Form] willingly and use it somehow in its voter \n6  registration process.” Id. at 9–10 (emphasis in original). “[T]he Federal Form provides a \n7  backstop: No matter what procedural hurdles a State’s own form imposes, the Federal Form \n8  guarantees that a simple means of registering to vote in federal elections will be available.” \n9  Id. at 12. But the Supreme Court noted that “while the NVRA forbids States to demand \n10  that an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the Federal Form, \n11  it does not preclude States from ‘deny[ing] registration based on information in their \n12  possession establishing the applicant’s ineligibility.’” Id. at 15 (emphasis added) (quoting \n13  § 20508(b)(1), which allows the Federal Form to include only that information “necessary \n14  to . . . assess the eligibility of the applicant”).  \n15  Arizona must accept the Federal Form as prima facie proof of an applicant’s \n16  eligibility  to  vote  but  the  NVRA  does  not  preclude  Arizona  from  independently \n17  determining that an applicant or voter is ineligible. The monthly database checks require \n18  county recorders to consult information available to Arizona; applicants do not submit any \n19  “additional information.” Id.; see § 16-165(I), (J). And a county recorder may cancel a \n20  registration only if the county recorder “confirms” from that information that the voter is \n21  not a citizen. § 16-165(A)(10). This is not “‘inconsistent with’ the NVRA’s mandate that \n22  States ‘accept and use’ the Federal Form.” ITCA, 570 U.S. at 15 (citation omitted); see id. \n23  (“The NVRA clearly contemplates that not every submitted Federal Form will result in \n24  registration.”).  \n25  Nor  do  the  investigation  and  additional  DPOC  requirements  “create[]  an \n26  unacceptable  obstacle  to  the  accomplishment  and  execution  of  the  full  purpose  and \n27  objectives of Congress.” Chamber of Com. v. Bonta, 62 F.4th 473, 482 (9th Cir. 2023) \n28  (citation and internal quotations omitted) (describing conflict preemption). “What is a \n \n- 77 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to be informed by examining the federal statute \n2  as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects. . . .” Crosby v. Nat’l Foreign \n3  Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 373 (2000). One of the NVRA’s purposes is to “enhance[] \n4  the participation of eligible citizens as voters in elections for Federal office.” 52 U.S.C. \n5  § 20501(b)(2)  (emphasis  added);  see  id.  § 20507(a)(1)  (states  must  “ensure  that  any \n6  eligible applicant is registered to vote” (emphasis added)). Arizona is entitled to cancel the \n7  registrations of ineligible voters “based on information in [its] possession establishing the \n8  applicant’s ineligibility”; it need not take a voter at her word. ITCA, 570 U.S. at 15.  \n9  Were the Court to embrace Plaintiffs’ theory that section 6 prohibited a county \n10  recorder from requesting information not contained on the Federal Form after confirming \n11  non-citizenship, Arizona seems left with no apparent means to request proof of eligibility \n12  before cancelling a registration. The Court is unaware of any caselaw interpreting the \n13  NVRA in this manner and, considering ITCA, declines to do so here. Section 6 does not \n14  preempt H.B. 2243’s mandate that a voter submit DPOC to avoid cancellation after the \n15  county recorder confirms the voter’s non-citizenship. \n16  2.  Section 8 of the NVRA \n17  Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws’ post-registration citizenship investigation \n18  provisions violate section 8(b) of the NVRA. Specifically, under H.B. 2492 § 7’s Attorney \n19  General Referral Provision, the Secretary of State and county recorders “shall” provide the \n20  Attorney General with the names of registered voters who have not provided DPOC, who \n21  must then investigate these registered voters by, “at a minimum,” consulting the MVD, \n22  SSA, SAVE, and NAPHSIS databases. § 16-143. Similarly, H.B. 2243’s List Maintenance \n23  Procedures direct county recorders to investigate the citizenship status of registered voters \n24  with a foreign-type license, voters lacking DPOC, and voters who county recorders have \n25  “reason to believe” are non-citizens. § 16-165(G)–(J). County recorders must then cancel \n26  the registrations of confirmed non-citizens. § 16-165(A)(10), (K). Section 8(b) of the \n27  NVRA, in relevant part, provides that “[a]ny State program or activity to protect the \n28  integrity of the electoral process by ensuring the maintenance of an accurate and current \n \n- 78 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  voter  registration  roll  for  elections  for  Federal  office  .  .  .  shall  be  uniform, \n2  nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965” (“Uniformity \n3  Provision”). 52 U.S.C. § 20507(b)(1). Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws are non-\n4  uniform and discriminatory specifically as applied to naturalized citizens and voters who \n5  do not provide DPOC. \n6      i.  H.B. 2243 § 2’s Reason to Believe Provision \n7  For the same reasons that H.B. 2243’s Reason to Believe Provision violates the Civil \n8  Rights Act, discussed above, the Court concludes that this provision violates section 8(b) \n9  of the NVRA. Only naturalized citizens would be subject to scrutiny under the Reason to \n10  Believe Provision, who if “confirmed” as non-citizens, would be required to provide \n11  DPOC. This would have a non-uniform and discriminatory impact on naturalized citizens. \n12  See United States v. Florida, 870 F. Supp. 2d 1346, 1350–51 (N.D. Fla. 2012) (finding \n13  secretary of state’s list maintenance program “probably ran afoul” of section 8 because its \n14  “methodology made it likely that the properly registered citizens who would be required to \n15  respond and provide documentation would be primarily newly naturalized citizens. The \n16  program was likely to have a discriminatory impact on these new citizens.”). \n17  ii.  H.B. 2243 § 2’s List Maintenance Procedures  and H.B. \n18  2492 § 7’s Attorney General Referral Provision  \n19  Plaintiffs claim that H.B. 2492 § 7 and H.B. 2243 § 2 violate section 8(b) of the \n20  NVRA by requiring county recorders to investigate the citizenship status of select groups \n21  of voters, specifically, registered voters without DPOC and naturalized citizens. In Husted \n22  v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, the Supreme Court reviewed a challenge to Ohio’s list \n23  maintenance procedures to remove voters who became ineligible due to a change in \n24  residence. 584 U.S. 756, 764–66 (2018). Specifically, Ohio would send voters who had not \n25  voted for two years a notice requesting verification of the voter’s address and remove \n26  voters who failed to respond to the notice. Id. at 765–66. The plaintiffs claimed that this \n27  procedure was unlawful under the NVRA in part because Ohio sent notices “without \n28  having any ‘reliable indicator’ that the addressee ha[d] moved.” Id. at 776. In rejecting this \n \n- 79 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  argument, the Supreme Court explained in part that “[s]o long as the trigger for sending \n2  such notices is ‘uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights \n3  Act,’ § 20507(b)(1), States can use whatever plan they think best.” Id. at 776–77.  \n4  Like in Randolph Institute,52 H.B. 2243 § 2 does not violate section 8 of the NVRA \n5  because the “trigger” for county recorders to investigate the citizenship status of applicants \n6  is  uniform  and  nondiscriminatory:  the  voter  has  not  submitted  DPOC  proving  her \n7  citizenship. The same is true for H.B. 2492 § 7’s mandate that county recorders provide \n8  the Attorney General with the names of registered voters lacking DPOC. These provisions \n9  necessarily require that county recorders first review the registration files of all registered \n10  voters before further investigating those individuals who have not submitted DPOC.53 C.f. \n11  Florida, 870 F. Supp. 2d at 1350–51. Regardless of whether Arizona “overestimated the \n12  correlation between” not submitting DPOC and non-citizenship, the NVRA does not \n13  prohibit the State from using this methodology to ensure that only eligible individuals are \n14  registered to vote.  Randolph Institute, 584  U.S. at 776; 52 U.S.C. § 20507(a)(1). In \n15  addition, no party presented evidence of a comprehensive database of all U.S. citizens, and \n16  it is not unreasonable for the Voting Laws to mandate consulting multiple sources that may \n17  contain citizenship information. Specifically, voters who have not submitted DPOC will \n18  be subject to MVD, NAPHSIS, and SAVE checks, if practicable.54 A.R.S. §§ 16-143, \n19   \n52 While Plaintiffs in Randolph Institute did not assert a claim under § 20507(b)(1), the \n20  majority noted that the dissent had not identified any evidence that Ohio’s program was \ntarnished by discriminatory intent. 584 U.S. at 779. \n21  53 Plaintiffs claim that H.B. 2492 § 7 and H.B. 2243 § 2 confer county recorders with \ndiscretion to arbitrarily implement these provisions. But the Voting Laws unequivocally \n22  mandate that county recorders investigate or refer to the Attorney General for investigation \nall voters lacking DPOC. Additionally, the Voting Laws prescribe the frequency with \n23  which county recorders and the Secretary of State must conduct citizenship checks. A.R.S. \n16-165(G) (requiring Secretary of State to conduct monthly MVD database comparisons), \n24  (I)–(J) (requiring county recorders to conduct monthly checks); c.f. Common Cause Ind. v. \nLawson,  327  F.  Supp.  3d  1139,  1153  (S.D.  Indiana  2018)  (concluding  that  the \n25  implementation of a voting law was likely to be non-uniform based on evidence that co-\ndirectors of the secretary of state’s election division “provid[ed] differing guidance to \n26  county officials on how to determine whether a particular registered voter is a duplicate \nregistered voter in a different state” (emphasis added)), aff’d on other grounds, 937 F.3d \n27  944.   \n54 SAVE checks are not practicable because SAVE requires an immigration number, \n28  meaning neither the Attorney General nor county recorders can conduct these checks on \n \n \n- 80 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  165(I), (J); c.f. Project Vote v. Blackwell, 455 F. Supp. 2d 694, 703 (N.D. Ohio 2006) \n2  (concluding Ohio's law that required only compensated voter registration workers to pre-\n3  register with the Secretary of State and undergo “online-only” training applied to only “a \n4  selected class of persons” because, among other things, “they [did] not apply to everyone \n5  involved in the process”).  \n6  Plaintiffs further claim that H.B. 2492 § 7 and H.B. 2243 § 2 violate section 8 \n7  because  the  additional  List  Maintenance  Procedures  and  Cancellation  Provision  will \n8  discriminatorily impact naturalized voters due to stale citizenship information in SAVE \n9  and  the  MVD  database.  See  A.R.S.  §§ 16-143(B)(3),  16-165(I).  Assuming  it  were \n10  somehow practicable for county recorders or the Attorney General to conduct SAVE \n11  checks on Federal-Only Voters (notwithstanding the current limitations of the SAVE MOA \n12  and the lack of immigration numbers for these voters), plaintiffs adduced no evidence that \n13  SAVE is so unreliable as to erroneously flag naturalized citizens as non-citizens each \n14  month. SAVE typically returns an individual’s naturalization status within 24 hours of \n15  naturalization, except for the occasional one or two-day delay. (See USCIS Dep. 39:20–\n16  41:19.) Even if SAVE may periodically return stale citizenship information, Plaintiffs have \n17  not shown that naturalized citizens will be disproportionality required to submit additional \n18  DPOC compared to other voters. Section 8 of the NVRA does not preempt the Voting \n19  Laws’ SAVE checks.  \n20  Nor does the NVRA preempt the Voting Laws’ MVD checks. The Attorney General \n21  must review the citizenship information of Federal-Only Voters in the MVD database. \n22  § 16-143(B)(1). In addition, the Secretary of State must notify county recorders of all \n23  registered voters who are “not a United States citizen according to the [MVD] database.” \n24  (2023 EPM at ECF-54); § 16-165(G). Under the Voting Laws, the only voters who may be \n25  flagged as non-citizens in the MVD database are naturalized citizens who still possess a \n26  foreign-type credential after naturalization. (2023 EPM at ECF-54; Jorgensen Tr. 560:2–\n \n27 \nany Federal-Only Voters who have not provided any form of DPOC. A.R.S. § 16-143(A) \n(citing § 16-166); (see 2023 EPM at 26–27; Petty Tr. 57:15–58:1 (explaining most voters \n28 \ndo not provide an immigration number).) For this reason, there will be no non-uniform use \nof SAVE on naturalized, Federal-Only Voters. \n \n- 81 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  14; see Pls.’ Stip. No. 93.) \n2  In United States v. Florida, the secretary of state compiled a list of voters that \n3  included any person who obtained a state license as a non-citizen, became a naturalized \n4  citizen, and registered to vote, but had not renewed their driver’s license and had not \n5  updated motor vehicle records to reflect their new citizenship status. 870 F. Supp. 2d at \n6  1347–48. The district court found that this methodology “probably” violated section 8 \n7  because “the Secretary’s program identified many properly registered citizens as potential \n8  noncitizens” and discriminatorily burdened naturalized citizens with proving citizenship. \n9  Id. at 1350. Citing Florida, the court in Texas League of United Latin American Citizens \n10  v. Whitley (“Texas LULAC”), came to a similar conclusion regarding the Texas Secretary \n11  of State’s “proactive process using tens of thousands of Department of Public Safety driver \n12  license records matched with voter registration records.” No. SA-19-CA-074-FB, 2019 \n13  WL 7938511, at *1 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 27, 2019). There, the court found that the Secretary’s \n14  program imposed a burden on “perfectly legal naturalized Americans” while “[n]o native \n15  born Americans were subjected to such treatment.”  Id. Unlike in Florida and Texas \n16  LULAC, however, Arizona requires that all voters submit DPOC or be subject to additional \n17  citizenship investigation procedures. §§ 16-121.01(D)–(E), 16-165(G).  \n18  Moreover, for naturalized citizens that provide DPOC when registering to vote \n19  (Full-Ballot Voters), MVD’s records of non-citizenship will not materially affect these \n20  voters’ registration status. The 2023 EPM explicitly directs county recorders to “confirm” \n21  reports of non-citizenship from the Secretary of State, which includes “deterimin[ing] \n22  whether the voter has previously provided DPOC.” (2023 EPM at ECF-57; see id. at ECF-\n23  27 n.10 (warning county recorders that MVD records may return outdated citizenship \n24  information  for  naturalized  citizens  registering  to  vote);  Morales  Tr.  613:25–614:3 \n25  (explaining the process of overriding a voter’s non-citizenship status in AVID when the \n26  voter has provided proof of naturalization as DPOC but MVD indicates non-citizenship).) \n27  Aside from Dr. McDonald’s “loop” theory, which the Court found unpersuasive, Plaintiffs \n28  have not adduced evidence that county recorders would ignore a voter’s DPOC on file and \n \n- 82 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  burden naturalized citizens with requiring new proof of citizenship. (See McDonald Tr. \n2  1071:24–1072:5.) And for those who have not provided DPOC (the 65 Federal-Only \n3  Voters with a foreign-type credential), the Court concluded supra Section II(C)(2) that \n4  Arizona  may  lawfully  request  proof  of  citizenship  when  it  obtains  and  confirms \n5  information in its possession that a Federal-Only Voter is a non-citizen. (See 2023 EPM at \n6  ECF-57 (“If a person has not previously provided DPOC, confirmation also includes \n7  reviewing relevant government databases . . . to the extent practicable” and may include \n8  “direct communication with the registrant.”)); ITCA, 570 U.S. at 17 (“[I]t would raise \n9  serious constitutional doubts if a federal statute precluded a State from obtaining the \n10  information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications.”).  \n11  Except for the Reason to Believe Provision, section 8 of the NVRA does not \n12  preempt H.B. 2492 § 7 nor H.B. 2243 § 2. \n13    D.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n14    Under section 2 of the VRA, States are prohibited from imposing any law, practice, \n15  or procedure “which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the \n16  United States to vote on account of race or color” or language-minority status. 52 U.S.C. \n17  §§ 10301(a), 10303(f)(2). A law violates section 2 if: \n18  [B]ased  on  the  totality  of  circumstances,  it  is  shown  that  the  political \nprocesses  leading  to  nomination  or  election  in  the  State  or  political \n19  subdivision are not equally open to participation by members [protected by \nsection 2] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of \n20  the  electorate  to  participate  in  the  political  process  and  to  elect \nrepresentatives of their choice.  \n21 \n22  Id. § 10301(b). “The essence of a § 2 claim . . . is that a certain electoral law, practice, or \n23  structure  interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the \n24  opportunities of minority and non-minority voters to elect their preferred representatives.” \n25  Brnovich v. Democratic Nat’l Comm. (“DNC”), 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2333 (2021) (cleaned up); \n26  see also Smith v. Salt River Project Agr. Imp. & Power Dist., 109 F.3d 586, 594 (9th Cir. \n27  1997) (“Section 2 requires proof only of a discriminatory result, not of discriminatory \n28  intent.”).  \n \n- 83 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  The Supreme Court has enumerated a non-exhaustive set of “guideposts” for courts \n2  to consider: (1) “the size of the burden imposed by the challenged voting rule”; (2) “the \n3  degree to which a voting rule departs from what was standard practice when § 2 was \n4  amended in 1982”; (3) “[t]he size of any disparities in a rule’s impact on members of \n5  different racial or ethnic groups”; (4) “the opportunities provided by a State’s entire system \n6  of voting”; and (5) “the strength of the state interests served by [the] challenged voting \n7  rule.” DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2338–39. Courts may also consult the “Senate” factors identified \n8  in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), though “their relevance is much less direct” \n9  when applied outside the vote-dilution context. DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2340.  \n10    Plaintiffs claim that H.B. 2492 §§ 4 and 7, and H.B. 2243 § 2 violate section 2 of \n11  the VRA. \n12      1.  Size of the Burden \n13  Most of the Voting Laws’ challenged provisions impose a de minimis burden on \n14  voters. The Citizenship Verification Procedures, Attorney General Referral Provision, and \n15  List Maintenance Procedures’  database  checks impose obligations related  to election \n16  administration on county recorders and the Attorney General to confirm the eligibility of \n17  applicants and registered voters. See DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2338 (focusing on the “effort and \n18  compliance” required by voters to determine whether a burden exists); § 16-121.01(D) \n19  (verifying citizenship of applicants without DPOC); § 16-143 (investigating citizenship of \n20  Federal-Only Voters); § 16-165(G)–(K) (investigating citizenship of registered voters). \n21  But assuming that the psychological impacts of being referred to the Attorney General for \n22  investigation is a burden on voting, Plaintiffs did introduce evidence that Latino and \n23  AANHPI voters, particularly those from mixed-status households, may fear exposing their \n24  families to increased government oversight. \n25  Only if a county recorder establishes that an applicant or registered voter is a non-\n26  citizen must that voter then provide DPOC. §§ 16-121.01(E), 16-165(A)(10); (2023 EPM \n27  at ECF-27.) For these voters, the Voting Laws’ DPOC Requirements may impose a modest \n28  burden on a subset of socioeconomically disadvantaged voters because of the potential \n \n- 84 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  monetary and temporal costs associated with obtaining DPOC. Moreover, the money and \n2  time necessary to obtain a birth certificate for native-born citizens pales in comparison to \n3  the cost of obtaining a naturalization certificate. C.f. Crawford v. Marion Cnty. Election \n4  Bd. (“Crawford II”), 553 U.S. 181, 198–99 (2008) (plurality opinion) (finding that the \n5  evidence “indicate[d] that a somewhat heavier burden may be placed on a limited number \n6  of persons . . . who because of economic or other personal limitations may find it difficult \n7  either  to  secure  a  copy  of  their  birth  certificate  or  to  assemble  the  other  required \n8  documentation to obtain a state-issued identification”); § 16-165(A)(10) (affording 35 days \n9  to provide DPOC before registration is cancelled); (but see 2023 EPM at ECF-22, -24 \n10  (allowing new registrants until the Thursday before election day to supply DPOC to be \n11  registered to vote).)  \n12  Arizona’s election laws mitigate this burden by allowing voters to provide numerous \n13  forms of DPOC, ranging from physical documents to writing an identification number on \n14  the registration form, which has worked for 99.5% of Arizona’s registered voters. See § 16-\n15  166. And Plaintiffs were unable to provide evidence quantifying the number of Arizonans \n16  qualified to vote that may be unable to provide any form of DPOC or that have been or will \n17  be  deterred  from  registering  to  vote  because  of  Arizona’s  DPOC  Requirements. \n18  Considering the discrete burden on particularly disadvantaged voters who do not possess \n19  DPOC however, the Court finds that this guidepost weighs slightly in favor of finding a \n20  section 2 violation. \n21  2.  Alternative Means of Registering  \n22    “[W]here a State provides multiple ways to vote, any burden imposed on voters who \n23  choose one of the available options cannot be evaluated without also taking into account \n24  the other available means.” DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2339. Practically speaking, the Voting Laws \n25  do not afford Arizonans “multiple ways” to register to vote. Individuals must provide \n26  DPOC when registering to vote or subject themselves to citizenship verification procedures \n27  that may later necessitate proof of citizenship. Specifically, while an applicants can register \n28  as Federal-Only Voters without DPOC, the Voting Laws’ Citizenship Verification and List \n \n- 85 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Maintenance Procedures may eventually require these voters to submit DPOC to remain \n2  registered. This guidepost weighs in favor of finding a section 2 violation. C.f. DNC, 141 \n3  S. Ct. at 2344 (citing the various methods Arizona allows voters to vote as mitigating \n4  evidence regarding the State’s mandate that voters vote in their assigned precinct on \n5  election day). \n6  3.  Disparate Impact \n7  As discussed supra Section I(A)(1), Arizona currently lacks DPOC for less than half \n8  a percent of its voters. Approximately one-third of a percent of Arizona’s White voters are \n9  Federal-Only Voters, and a little more than two-thirds of a percent of minority voters are \n10  Federal-Only  Voters.  (See  Ex.  338.)  In  DNC,  the  district  court  had  found  that \n11  approximately one percent of minority voters had cast ballots in the wrong precinct, while \n12  a half a percent of White voters did so. DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2345. The Supreme Court \n13  rejected the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of these statistics that “minority voters in Arizona \n14  cast [out-of-precinct] ballots at twice the rate of White voters,” and instead concluded that \n15  “[p]roperly understood, the statistics show only a small disparity that provides little support \n16  for” finding a disparate impact. Id. (first alteration in original). “A policy that appears to \n17  work for 98% or more of voters to whom it applies—minority and non-minority alike—is \n18  unlikely to render a system unequally open.” Id. at 2344–45 (concluding the policy’s racial \n19  disparity was “small in absolute terms”); see also Fair Fight Action, 634 F. Supp. 3d at \n20  1244 (finding no disparate impact where citizenship checks affected “less than one percent \n21  of any minority group”). As in DNC, any disparate impact regarding the Voting Laws’ \n22  Citizenship Verification Procedures and List Maintenance Procedures is markedly small.55  \n23  More precisely for naturalized citizens,56 65 Federal-Only Voters, or one-third of a \n24  percent of the 19,439 Federal-Only Voters, possess a foreign-type credential. (MVD Non-\n \n25  55 Relatedly, for voters who are called upon to furnish DPOC pursuant to the Voting Laws, \neconomically  disadvantaged  voters  might  encounter  more  financial  challenges  when \n26 \nobtaining DPOC. But the cost of obtaining DPOC alone is insufficient for the Court to \nmeasure  how  the  Voting  Laws’  DPOC  Requirements  will  disproportionately  impact \n27 \nminority groups without first assuming that these voters in fact lack all forms of DPOC. \n56 As discussed above, these voters will not be subject to recurring SAVE checks and risk \n28 \nbeing erroneously flagged as a non-citizen unless they have previously provided county \nrecorders with an immigration number. \n \n- 86 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Citizen Records.) The Voting Laws’ MVD checks will flag these voters as non-citizens, \n2  thereby triggering additional investigation by county recorders or the Attorney General and \n3  possibly requiring DPOC, while all other Federal-Only Voters will not be subject to these \n4  procedures.57 §§ 16-143(B)(1), 16-165(A)(10), (G). But given the very few circumstances \n5  that a voter will be called upon to provide DPOC, the Voting Laws’ impact on naturalized \n6  citizens who may not possess DPOC is negligible and weighs against finding a section 2 \n7  violation.  \n8      3.  Laws and Practices in 1982 \n9  United States citizenship has always been a qualification to vote in Arizona. See \n10  Ariz. Const. art. VII, § 2. While the State Form has included “[a] statement that the \n11  registrant is a citizen of the United States” since 1980, no laws analogous to the Voting \n12  Laws’ DPOC Requirements existed in Arizona in 1982. See 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 209, \n13  § 3 (adopting A.R.S. § 16-152 to require contents of the State Form). Nevertheless, Arizona \n14  has already required DPOC for two decades, and the Voting Laws’ additional citizenship \n15  verification procedures reinforce the State’s longstanding limitation of the right to vote to \n16  citizens. See Fair Fight Action, 634 F. Supp. 3d at 1243 (“The use of a birth certificate as \n17  a means of establishing identification—and citizenship—speaks to the State’s policy of \n18  trying to enforce the citizenship requirement prior to 1982.”). This weighs against finding \n19  a section 2 violation. \n20      4.  State Interests  \n21  Arizona has a legitimate interest in preventing voter fraud and ensuring that only \n22  eligible Arizonans are registered to vote. See DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2340 (“One strong and \n23  entirely legitimate state interest is the prevention of fraud.”); Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 196 \n24  (“There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State’s interest in counting \n25  only the votes of eligible voters.”). “Section 2 does not require a State to show that its \n26  chosen policy is absolutely necessary or that a less restrictive means would not adequately \n27 \n \n57 On the opposite end of the scale, Dr. Richman identified 112 Federal-Only Voters for \n28 \nwhom MVD has DPOC on record and would be eligible to vote as a Full-Ballot Voter. It \nis unclear, however, whether these voters are naturalized or native-born citizens. \n \n- 87 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  serve  the  State’s  objectives.”  DNC,  141  S.  Ct.  at  2345–46.  Consulting  government \n2  databases that may contain information about a voter’s citizenship status, and subsequently \n3  requiring DPOC when a voter’s citizenship is seriously in question, serves this interest. \n4  Fair Fight Action, 634 F. Supp. 3d at 1245 (finding state’s interest in preventing voter \n5  fraud served by the state’s “citizenship flag” that is triggered “when there is affirmative \n6  evidence that someone who registered has a noncitizen driver’s license”). And while voter \n7  fraud in Arizona is incredibly rare, the State “may take action to prevent election fraud \n8  without waiting for it to occur and be detected within its own borders.” DNC, 141 S. Ct. at \n9  2348 (finding Arizona’s justification for third-party ballot-collection restrictions legitimate \n10  despite “no evidence that fraud in connection with early ballots had occurred in Arizona”). \n11  This weighs against finding a section 2 violation.  \n12    5.  Senate Factors \n13  The Supreme Court in DNC noted that beyond the Senate factors’ original purpose \n14  in vote-dilution cases, their “only relevance . . . is to show that minority group members \n15  suffered discrimination in the past (factor one) and that effects of that discrimination persist \n16  (factor five).” 141 S. Ct. at 2340 (citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36–37).  \n17  Plaintiffs’  experts  established  that  Arizona  has  a  long  history  of  race-based \n18  discrimination  against  Latino,  AANHPI,  and  Native  American  individuals.  Animus \n19  permeated  Arizona’s  legal  system,  from  banning  interracial  marriage  and  precluding \n20  immigrants from owning land, to mandating that classrooms and political subdivisions act \n21  only in English. Specific to voting, Arizona imposed  literacy tests for 60 years and \n22  conducted  regular  voter  purging  practices.  And  Arizona  was  subject  to  the  VRA’s \n23  preclearance requirement until the Supreme Court’s ruling in Shelby County. The effects \n24  of these discriminatory practices continue to linger, particularly as it relates to educational \n25  and economic outcomes for people of color. (See generally ACS Household Income; ACS \n26  Poverty Rates; ACS Educational Attainment.) However, considering the Voting Laws’ \n27  limited to modest burdens, the small disparate impact on Federal-Only, minority and \n28  naturalized voters, and the state’s interests, the Court concludes that the Voting Laws’ \n \n- 88 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  citizenship investigation and additional DPOC Requirements do not “result[] in a denial or \n2  abridgment” of citizens’ right to vote in Arizona. § 10301(a).   \n3    E.  Anderson/Burdick Claims \n4     Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws impose an undue burden on the right to vote \n5  in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.58 Plaintiffs also claim that the Voting \n6  Laws  burden  voters’  equal  protection  and  procedural  due  process  rights.  The \n7  Anderson/Burdick  framework  applies  to  these  claims.  See  Ariz.  Democratic  Party  v. \n8  Hobbs, 18 F.4th 1179, 1194–95 (9th Cir. 2021) (“ADP III”) (holding that due process \n9  challenges to election laws should be evaluated under the Anderson/Burdick framework); \n10  Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1106 n.15 (9th Cir. 1011) (explaining that the Supreme \n11  Court has analyzed due process and equal protection claims under the same framework). \n12  Courts evaluate the validity of an election law by balancing the burden the law places on \n13  the fundamental right to vote against the state interests served by the law. See Anderson v. \n14  Celebrezze,  460  U.S.  780,  789  (1983).  The  Court  must  “consider  the  character  and \n15  magnitude of the  asserted  injury to the  rights protected  by the  First and Fourteenth \n16  Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate”; “identify and evaluate the precise \n17  interests put forward by the [s]tate as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule”; \n18  “determine the legitimacy and strength of each of those interests”; and “consider the extent \n19  to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Id.; see ADP \n20  III, 18 F.4th at 1187. \n21  “[T]he severity of the burden the election law imposes on the plaintiff’s rights \n22  dictates the level of scrutiny applied by the court.” Nader v. Brewer, 531 F.3d 1028, 1034 \n23  (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992)). “Regulations \n24  imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs’ rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a \n25  compelling state interest. Lesser burdens, however, trigger less exacting review, and a \n26  State’s  important  regulatory  interests  will  usually  be  enough  to  justify  reasonable, \n27  nondiscriminatory restrictions.” Pierce v. Jacobsen, 44 F.4th 853, 859–60 (9th Cir. 2022) \n \n28  58 The Court declines to decide Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims for those sections of the \nVoting Laws that the Court has already ruled unlawful under the CRA, NVRA, or VRA. \n \n- 89 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  (quoting Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997)); see Dudum, \n2  640 F.3d at 1114 (“[W]hen a challenged rule imposes only limited burdens on the right to \n3  vote, there is no requirement that the rule is the only or the best way to further the proffered \n4  interests.”). “This is a sliding scale test, where the more severe the burden, the more \n5  compelling the state’s interest must be.” Soltysik v. Padilla, 910 F.3d 438, 444 (9th Cir. \n6  2018). \n7    1.  Burden on the Right to Vote \n8  A  restriction  is  “not  severe”  when  it  is  “generally  applicable,  even-handed, \n9  politically neutral, and . . . protect[s] the reliability and integrity of the election process.” \n10  Rubin v. City of Santa Monica, 308 F.3d 1008, 1014 (9th Cir. 2002). This balance means \n11  that voting regulations are rarely subjected to strict scrutiny. See Lemons v. Bradbury, 538 \n12  F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008). But in the equal protection context, laws that impose “‘a \n13  particular  burden  on  an  identifiable  segment’  of  voters  are  more  likely  to  raise \n14  constitutional concerns” and demand more exacting review. ADP III, 18 F.4th at 1190; \n15  Public Integrity All., Inc. v. City of Tucson, 836 F.3d 1019, 1024 n.2 (9th Cir. 2016) (en \n16  banc) (“[C]ourts may consider not only a given law’s impact on the electorate in general, \n17  but also its impact on subgroups, for whom the burden, when considered in context, may \n18  be more severe.” (citing Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 199–203)). Plaintiffs must present \n19  sufficient evidence for the Court to quantify the burden imposed on a specific subgroup of \n20  voters. See Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 199–203 (weighing the evidence plaintiffs presented \n21  to the district court to determine burdens imposed by Indiana’s photo ID law).  \n22  As  discussed  regarding  Plaintiffs’  VRA  claim,  the  Voting  Laws’  Citizenship \n23  Verification  Procedures,  Attorney  General  Referral  Provision,  and  List  Maintenance \n24  Procedures primarily impose burdens on county recorders and the Attorney General, not \n25  voters. See §§ 16-121.01(D), 16-143, 16-165(G)–(K). The “burden” of an election law is \n26  measured by the cost of compliance, not the “consequence of noncompliance.” ADP III, \n27  18 F.4th at 1188–89 (quoting Ariz. Democratic Party v. Hobbs (“ADP I”), 485 F. Supp. 3d \n28  1073, 1087 (D. Ariz. 2020), vacated on other grounds, ADP III, 18 F.4th 1179). In ADP \n \n- 90 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  III, the plaintiffs argued that an election-day deadline to correct a ballot with a missing \n2  signature imposed a severe burden on voters who submitted a ballot at the last minute and \n3  election officials did not discover the missing signature until after the deadline. Id. at 1187–\n4  88. In rejecting this argument, the Ninth Circuit explained: \n5  The relevant burden for constitutional purposes is the small burden of signing \nthe affidavit or, if the voter fails to sign, of correcting the missing signature \n6  by election day. To the extent that the election-day deadline results in voters’ \nnot casting a vote in an election, that result “was not caused by the election-\n7  day deadline, but by their own failure to take timely steps to effect their vote.”  \n8  Id. at 1189 (quoting Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 758 (1973)) (cleaned up).  \n9  ADP III’s reasoning applies to this case. The relevant burden is the cost of timely \n10  complying with the Voting Laws’ DPOC Requirements when registering to vote or after \n11  receiving a notice of non-citizenship from the county recorder. §§ 16-121.01(C), (E), 16-\n12  165(A)(10); (2023 EPM at ECF-17, -22, -24, -27.) The Voting Laws’ ongoing database \n13  checks, investigations by the Attorney General, and potential rejection or cancellation of a \n14  voter’s registration are not burdens, but merely the consequences of not providing DPOC. \n15  ADP III 18 F.4th at 1188; see also ADP I, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 1087–88 (explaining that if \n16  burdens were measured by the “consequence of noncompliance” and that consequence is \n17  disenfranchisement, that all voting pre-requisites would be subject to strict scrutiny). These \n18  provisions remain relevant however, as the frequency at which county recorders might \n19  reject  or  cancel  registrations  under  the  Citizenship  Verification  Procedures  and  List \n20  Maintenance Procedures can serve as an indicator of the severity of the burden DPOC \n21  imposes. See, e.g., Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 202 (reviewing the frequency of individuals \n22  unable to obtain a photo ID in part to identify “how common the problem is”); Obama for \n23  America v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 431 (6th Cir. 2012) (affirming district court’s ruling that \n24  Ohio’s changes to early voting imposed a “particularly high” burden because “[p]laintiffs \n25  introduced extensive evidence that a significant number of Ohio voters will in fact be \n26  precluded from voting” as a result of the changes). \n27  The Voting Laws DPOC Requirements place a particular burden on individuals for \n28  whom, due to socioeconomic factors, the effort required to obtain and provide county \n \n- 91 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  recorders  with  the  appropriate  documentation  is  cost  or  time  prohibitive.  The  Court \n2  concluded  this  was  limited  to  modest  in  analyzing  Plaintiffs’  VRA  claim,  but \n3  Anderson/Burdick demands closer scrutiny of the evidence for the Court to determine a \n4  more precise magnitude of this burden.59 Plaintiffs offered no witness testimony or other \n5  “concrete evidence” to corroborate that the Voting Laws’ DPOC Requirements will in fact \n6  impede any qualified voter from registering to vote or staying on the voter rolls. Crawford \n7  II, 553 U.S. at 201 (reviewing the “limited evidence” presented to the district court and \n8  unable to determine “the magnitude of the impact [a voter ID law] will have on indigent \n9  voters”).  \n10  First, while there are more than 19,000 Federal-Only Voters who have not supplied \n11  proof of citizenship, Plaintiffs have not estimated the number of these voters that wholly \n12  lack DPOC, nor quantified whether naturalized voters or voters of color are more likely to \n13  lack DPOC. Id. at 202 n.20 (noting that “nothing in the record establishe[d] the distribution \n14  of voters who lack photo identification” or “even a rough estimate of how many indigent \n15  voters lack copies of  their birth certificates [in order  to obtain an ID]”);60 c.f. Ariz. \n16  Libertarian Party v. Reagan, 798 F.3d 723, 731 (9th Cir. 2015) (“Without some assessment \n17  of how many voters actually use the Registration Form [as opposed to registering under \n18  one of three alternative means], we cannot even begin to gauge the impact it may have had \n19  on party registration rolls.”). For those voters who possess DPOC but want to avoid the \n20 \n \n59 The Supreme Court’s “size of the burden” guidepost in DNC blurs the distinction \n21 \nbetween the burden on voting rights central to an Anderson/Burdick claim and the disparate \nimpact of voting laws central to a section 2 VRA claim. Despite the analyses’ apparent \n22 \noverlap, the foundation of a section 2 claim remains clear: a plaintiff may demonstrate that \nelections are not “equally open,” due in part to the burdens imposed on voters. 52 U.S.C. \n23 \n§ 10301(b). By contrast, the crux of an Anderson/Burdick claim is the “character and \nmagnitude” of the burden itself. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. \n24  60 In Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, the Supreme Court held that Virginia violated \nthe Equal Protection Clause by imposing a poll tax on individuals seeking to vote because \n25 \nthe ability to pay the tax was not related to voter qualifications. 383 U.S. 663, 668 (1966). \nThe plurality in Crawford II noted that even if “most voters already possess a . . . form of \n26 \nacceptable identification” to satisfy Indiana’s photo identification law, this “would not save \nthe statute under Harper, if the State required voters to pay a tax or a fee to obtain a new \n27 \nphoto identification.” 553 U.S. at 198. Crawford nevertheless concluded that there was \ninsufficient evidence to quantify the magnitude of the burden on individuals who could not \n28 \nafford a birth certificate, which was required to obtain a photo identification. Id. at 200–\n02. Crawford’s reasoning applies here.  \n \n- 92 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  “inconvenience” of providing it to county recorders, this “does not qualify as a substantial \n2  burden on the right to vote.” Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 198. Second, even assuming some \n3  Federal-Only Voters do not possess DPOC, the evidence does not reliably illustrate the \n4  likelihood that voters will encounter obstacles to obtaining this information. The monetary \n5  and temporal costs of obtaining DPOC, particularly naturalization documents, can be \n6  significant for low-income individuals. But naturalized citizens experience lower levels of \n7  poverty than other Arizonans, including native-born citizens, and it bears reiterating that \n8  naturalized citizens need only provide an immigration number. And 82% of Arizona’s \n9  Latino citizens are native-born, meaning most Latino voters may need to only obtain a new \n10  birth certificate. Though the costs of obtaining DPOC may have a greater impact on low-\n11  income Arizonans, this burden is nevertheless slight in the context of all Arizonan’s overall \n12  ability to register to vote. \n13  Turning to Plaintiffs’ related due process claims, the Court’s ruling that the Reason \n14  to  Believe  Provision  is  unlawful  under  the  CRA  and  the  NVRA  dispels  Plaintiffs’ \n15  speculation that county recorders will rely on unfounded suspicions of non-citizenship to \n16  cancel voter registrations. Pursuant to H.B. 2243’s remaining provisions, county recorders \n17  may still “obtain” information of non-citizenship from SAVE and NAPHSIS for Federal-\n18  Only voters and from the MVD database. A.R.S. § 16-165(G), (I), (J). Regarding the \n19  Voting Laws’ temporal limitations on the opportunity to cure a voter registration, county \n20  recorders must, within ten days of matching an applicant with evidence of non-citizenship, \n21  notify the applicant that she has until the Thursday before election day to provide DPOC \n22  and be registered to vote.61 (2023 EPM at ECF-17, -22, -24, -27.) Finding the burden of \n23  correcting a missing ballot signature by an election-day deadline to be “limited” in ADP \n24  III, the Ninth Circuit explained that “[t]he deadline does not prohibit voters from voting in \n25  any election; they must either sign the affidavit at the outset or correct a missing signature \n26  by the deadline of election day.” 18 F.4th at 1189. The Court finds the case instructive here, \n27 \n \n61 For this reason alone, Plaintiffs’ argument that H.B. 2492 § 4’s Citizenship Verification \n28 \nProcedures violate voter registrants’ procedural due process rights because registrants are \nnot allowed any opportunity to contest a county recorder’s finding of non-citizenship fails. \n \n- 93 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  as  the  2023  EPM’s  Thursday  deadline  may  result  in  some  qualified  Arizonans  not \n2  becoming registered to vote. While ADP III implicated only a missing signature, the burden \n3  of timely obtaining DPOC similarly increases the closer to an election an individual decides \n4  to register to vote without proactively proving citizenship. See Rosario, 410 U.S. at 758 \n5  (concluding New York’s election law “merely imposed a time deadline on [voters’] \n6  enrollment” and voters who attained voting age before the deadline “clearly could have \n7  registered” in time for the election). And based on the evidence at trial, the Court is left to \n8  speculate  as  to  whether  the  occurrence  of  Arizonans  who  may  lack  DPOC  and  be \n9  meaningfully  impacted  by  processing  delays  when  obtaining  new  citizenship \n10  documentation is sufficiently “frequent as to raise [a] question about the constitutionality” \n11  of the Voting Laws. Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 197.  \n12  Finally, county recorders will in fact “obtain” information of non-citizenship from \n13  MVD’s monthly customer extracts for at least 65 naturalized citizens registered as Federal-\n14  Only Voters who possess a foreign-type license.62 But the Court will not assume without \n15  any persuasive evidence that these 65 of Arizona’s 19,439 Federal-Only Voters wholly \n16  lack DPOC such that they would be burdened by the List Maintenance Procedures’ 35-day \n17  deadline.63 Moreover, voters receive notice by forwardable mail that their registration has \n18  been cancelled and instructions regarding how to re-register if the voter is qualified. (2023 \n19  EPM at ECF-58.)  \n20  Plaintiffs  cite  Fish  v.  Schwab  (“Fish  II”),  which  held  that  Kansas’  proof  of \n21 \n \n62 While the Voting Laws’ monthly MVD checks may misidentify naturalized citizens as \n22 \nnon-citizens, the evidence indicates that all but 65 naturalized active voters with a foreign-\ntype license have already provided county recorders with DPOC. Because county recorders \n23 \nmust confirm evidence of non-citizenship by reviewing an individual’s voter file, the Court \nconcludes that naturalized citizens who possess a foreign-type license but have already \n24 \nprovided DPOC will not be unduly burdened by the Voting Laws.   \n63 Plaintiffs argue that Governor Ducey vetoed H.B. 2617 for lacking “sufficient due \n25 \nprocess” protections. Plaintiffs point specifically to H.B. 2617’s cancellation provision, \nwhich would have afforded voters 90 days to provide DPOC and avoid cancellation, \n26 \ninstead of the 35 days in H.B. 2243. (Compare H.B. 2617 Text, with H.B. 2243 Text.) But \nGovernor  Ducey  found  that  H.B.  2617’s  requirement  that  county  recorders  cancel \n27 \nregistrations after “receiv[ing] information that provides the basis for determining that the \nperson is not a qualified elector” was “vague and lack[ed] any guidance for how a county \n28 \nrecorder would confirm such a determination.” (H.B. 2617 Veto Letter at PX 053-1.) \nGovernor Ducey did not mention the 90-day cancellation provision.  \n \n- 94 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  citizenship requirement imposed an undue burden on the right to vote. 957 F.3d 1105, \n2  1127–32 (10th Cir. 2020). The Tenth Circuit found the proof of citizenship requirement \n3  imposed a “significant” burden “primarily” because the Kansas Secretary of State had \n4  suspended or cancelled 31,000 registrations for the voters’ failure to provide proof of \n5  citizenship. Id. at 1127–28. Here however, Arizona may not deny, suspend, or cancel voter \n6  registrations when a  voter fails to provide DPOC.  These individuals will instead be \n7  registered  as  Federal-Only  Voters  unless  county  recorders  match  the  registration  to \n8  information of non-citizenship. A.R.S. § 16-121.01(E). And county recorders may only \n9  cancel  a registered voter’s registration  if the voter is confirmed  a non-citizen.  § 16-\n10  165(A)(10). Without any similar quantifiable evidence regarding how many qualified \n11  Arizonans’ registrations without DPOC might be rejected or cancelled under the Voting \n12  Laws’ new DPOC Requirements, it would be mere conjecture to conclude that the DPOC \n13  Requirements would impose a burden as significant as that in Fish II. \n14  The Voting Laws do not impose an excessive burden on any specific subgroup of \n15  voters raising equal protection concerns. Instead, based on the evidence presented, the \n16  Court concludes that the Voting Laws impose only a limited burden on all individuals \n17  qualified to vote in Arizona.  \n18      2.  The State’s Interests \n19  Because the Voting Laws’ DPOC Requirement imposes a limited burden on the \n20  right to vote, the Court conducts a “less exacting review” of Arizona’s interests. Pierce, 44 \n21  F.4th at 859–60. The State offers two justifications for the Voting Laws: preventing non-\n22  citizens from voting and promoting voter confidence in Arizona’s elections.  \n23  Arizona has an indisputably legitimate interest “in counting only the votes of \n24  eligible voters,” and the State is entitled to enact prophylactic legislation to prevent the \n25  occurrence of non-citizen voting. Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 196; DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2348; \n26  see also League of Women Voters of Fla. Inc. v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 66 F.4th 905, 925 (11th \n27  Cir. 2023) (rejecting plaintiffs’ argument that a voting law designed to prevent voter fraud \n28  was a “proverbial solution in search of a problem” and a pretext for discrimination because \n \n- 95 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  “[t]he Supreme Court has already held that deterring voter fraud is a legitimate policy on \n2  which to enact an election law, even in the absence of any record evidence of voter fraud.” \n3  (quoting Greater Birmingham Ministries v. Sec’y of State for State of Ala., 992 F.3d 1299, \n4  1334 (11th Cir. 2021))). The State “need not offer ‘elaborate, empirical verification’” of \n5  non-citizen voting, but it also may not rely on mere “speculative concern[s]” “to justify \n6  any non-severe voting regulation.” Soltysik, 910 F.3d at 448–49 (emphasis in original) \n7  (quoting Timmons, 520 U.S. at 364). \n8  While rare, voter fraud in Arizona does exist. The Arizona Attorney General’s \n9  Office initiated 38 prosecutions for illegal voting between 2010 and 2023, albeit with most \n10  of these cases concerning voting in more than one jurisdiction, or “double voting.” (Ex. \n11  292 at PX 292-1 to -6; Lawson Tr. 1688:3–19, 1689:7–24.) In addition, there are currently \n12  two sealed indictments related to non-citizen voting. (Lawson Tr. 1691:11–13, 1692:5–\n13  1694:15.) At the local level, Maricopa County initiated 13 prosecutions specifically for \n14  non-citizen voting between 2007 and 2008. (Minnite Tr. 1588:3–23.) And to be sure, while \n15  deliberate non-citizen voting is but one form of voter fraud, the legislative history indicates \n16  that the Legislature was concerned with non-citizen voting more generally. (See, e.g., H.B. \n17  2492 House Gov. Comm. Tr. at PX 054-3 to -4; Ex. 61 at PX 061-28 to -30, -39 to -40; \n18  Minnite  Tr.  1630:13–1632:7.)  The  State’s  interests  in  preventing  voter  fraud  and \n19  unintentional non-citizen voting are both legitimate, as both forms of non-citizen voting \n20  can undermine the integrity of Arizona’s elections.  \n21  The State has a related justification for the Voting Laws: “safeguarding public \n22  confidence by eliminating [fraud and] even appearances of fraud.” Ohio Democratic Party \n23  v. Husted, 834 F.3d 620, 633 (6th Cir. 2016) (internal quotations omitted). “[P]ublic \n24  confidence in the integrity of the electoral process has independent significance, because \n25  it encourages citizen participation in the democratic process.” Crawford II, 553 U.S. at \n26  197. Setting aside the absence of evidence that Arizona’s 19,439 Federal-Only Voters are \n27  non-citizens,  the  Court  is  mindful  that  the  “electoral  system  cannot  inspire  public \n28  confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of \n \n- 96 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  voters.” Id. Arizona is “permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the electoral \n2  process with foresight rather than reactively.” Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. \n3  189, 195–96 (1986); DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2348. While Plaintiffs may disagree with the \n4  efficacy of this method, “the propriety of doing so is perfectly clear”: it helps ensure that \n5  any non-citizens that register to vote, intentionally or mistakenly, do not make it onto or \n6  remain on the voter rolls. Crawford II, 553 U.S. at 196; see also Dudum, 640 F.3d at 1114 \n7  (“[W]hen a challenged rule imposes only limited burdens on the right to vote, there is no \n8  requirement that the rule is the only or the best way to further the proffered interests.”). \n9  Considering the evidence as a whole, the Court concludes that Arizona’s interests \n10  in preventing non-citizens from voting and promoting public confidence in Arizona’s \n11  elections outweighs the limited burden voters might encounter when required to provide \n12  DPOC.  \n13    F.  Remaining Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment Claims  \n14  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person \n15  within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. The \n16  Fifteenth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall \n17  not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or \n18  previous condition of servitude.” U.S. Const. amend. XV, § 1. There are two aspects to the \n19  equal protection doctrine: suspect classifications and fundamental rights. “The first strand \n20  bars a state from codifying a preference for one class over another,” such as based on race \n21  or national origin, while “[t]he second strand bars a state from burdening a fundamental \n22  right for some citizens but not for others. Absent some such burden, however, legislative \n23  distinctions merit no special scrutiny.” Short v. Brown, 893 F.3d 671, 678–79 (9th Cir. \n24  2018) (internal citations omitted). \n25  1.  Bush v. Gore Arbitrary and Disparate Treatment \n26  Non-US Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws subject registrants to “arbitrary and \n27  disparate treatment,” under the equal protection standard articulated in Bush v. Gore, 531 \n28  U.S. 98, 104–09 (2000) (per curiam). The parties disagree whether Bush provides an equal \n \n- 97 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  protection analysis independent of the Anderson/Burdick framework.  \n2  Bush concerned the application of the one-person, one-vote principle in the context \n3  of a court-ordered “statewide recount with minimal procedural safeguards.” 531 U.S. at \n4  109. Specifically, the Florida Supreme Court directed election officials to discern the intent \n5  of voters for whom their “punchcard” ballots were not “perforated with sufficient precision \n6  for a machine to register the perforation.” Id. at 105. But the court did not provide election \n7  officials with any standards by which to determine voter “intent,” resulting in disparate \n8  treatment among similarly situated voters. Id. at 105–06. The Supreme Court explained \n9  that “[h]aving once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later \n10  arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person’s vote over that of another.” Id. 104–\n11  05 (citation omitted).  \n12  The Ninth Circuit has cast doubt on whether Bush is “applicable to more than the \n13  one election to which the [Supreme] Court appears to have limited it.” Lemons, 538 F.3d \n14  at 1106; see Paher v. Cegavske, 457 F. Supp. 3d 919, 927–28 (D. Nev. 2020) (analyzing \n15  claim  under  Anderson-Burdick  and  rejecting  plaintiffs’  claim  that  Nevada’s  all-mail \n16  primary would result in “voter disenfranchisement in the form of vote dilution” such that \n17  Bush should apply). And those cases where the Ninth Circuit has applied Bush have \n18  similarly focused on the one-person, one-vote principle. Idaho Coal. United for Bears v. \n19  Cenarrusa, 342 F.3d 1073, 1077–78, 1077 n.7 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that Idaho’s ballot-\n20  initiative process violated the one-person, one-vote principle, and citing Bush); Sw. Voter \n21  Registration Educ. Project v. Shelley, 344 F.3d 882, 894–95 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that \n22  plaintiffs’ claim “mirror[ed]” that in Bush, “that is, whether unequal methods of counting \n23  votes among counties constitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Clause”), rev’d on \n24  other grounds en banc, 344 F.3d 914 (9th Cir.) (describing Bush as “the leading case on \n25  disputed elections” (emphasis added)). Bush itself emphasized that its “consideration [was] \n26  limited to the present circumstances.” 531 U.S. at 109 (noting “the special instance of a \n27  statewide recount under the authority of a single state judicial officer”).  \n28  Assuming Bush applied, “[c]ourts have generally found equal protection violations \n \n- 98 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  where  a  lack  of  uniform  standards  and  procedures  results  in  arbitrary  and  disparate \n2  treatment of [similarly situated] voters.” Lecky v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 285 F. Supp. \n3  3d 908, 920 (E.D. Va. 2018). The Voting Laws are not tainted by “varying” or complete \n4  “absence of specific standards” that the Supreme Court found problematic with Florida’s \n5  recount. Bush, 531 U.S. at 106–07. County recorders may reject a voter registration only \n6  after matching that registrant to evidence of non-citizenship from the Voting Laws’ list of \n7  databases.  § 16-121.01(D),  (E);  (2023  EPM  at  ECF-56.)  Whether  an  applicant’s \n8  registration information “matches” to information of non-citizenship leaves no guesswork \n9  to county recorders. The List Maintenance Procedures and Cancellation Provision likewise \n10  mandate  county  recorders  to  “obtain”  and  “confirm”  information  from  these  same \n11  databases before requesting DPOC from the voter. § 16-165(A)(10). Setting aside the \n12  occasional match to outdated MVD citizenship information for naturalized citizens, these \n13  databases contain objective and readily verifiable information that in nearly all cases will \n14  not require county recorders to request DPOC from a registrant or voter. (See, e.g., 2023 \n15  EPM at ECF-57 (requiring county recorders to match a suspected non-citizen to a voter \n16  registration,  determine  whether  that  voter  has  already  provided  DPOC,  and  review \n17  available  government  databases  before  requesting  DPOC).)  Furthermore,  Plaintiffs \n18  adduced  no  evidence  that  county  recorders  will  act  arbitrarily  when  confirming  an \n19  individual’s non-citizenship. This is buttressed by the fact that the Court’s ruling prohibits \n20  county recorders from investigating the citizenship status of registered voters based on a \n21  mere “reason to believe” that a voter is a non-citizen. (See supra Sections II(B)(3), (C)(3)(i) \n22  (concluding the Reason to Believe Provision is unlawful).) \n23  2.  Race & National Origin or Alienage Discrimination \n24  Lastly, Plaintiffs claim that the Voting Laws are facially discriminatory, and in the \n25  alternative, were motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Facial unconstitutionality does \n26  not require a finding of discriminatory intent. Mitchell v. Washington, 818 F.3d 436, 445–\n27  46 (9th Cir. 2016) (“When the government expressly classifies persons on the bases of race \n28  or national origin . . . its action is ‘immediately suspect’. . . . A plaintiff in such a lawsuit \n \n- 99 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  need not make an extrinsic showing of discriminatory animus or a discriminatory effect to \n2  trigger strict scrutiny.” (citation omitted)). But a plaintiff must prove discriminatory intent \n3  if the challenged law does not expressly classify persons on the bases of race or national \n4  origin. Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977). \n5  The Voting Laws require all voters to provide DPOC or be subject to recurring \n6  database  checks  to  validate  citizenship.  E.g.,  §§ 16-121.01(D),  (E),  16-165(G)–(K). \n7  Plaintiffs cite a string of cases to argue that the Voting Laws facially discriminate based on \n8  national origin because the databases county recorders must use to verify citizenship can \n9  contain  outdated  citizenship  information  only  for  naturalized  citizens.  But  Plaintiffs \n10  conflate facial discrimination with discriminatory effects. Compare Florida, 870 F. Supp. \n11  2d at 1350 (finding law’s use of MVD data “likely” had a “discriminatory impact” on \n12  naturalized citizens), and Texas LULAC, 2019 WL 7938511, at *1 (citing Florida for \n13  similar proposition), with Boustani v. Blackwell, 460 F. Supp. 2d 822, 824–25 (N.D. Ohio \n14  2006) (concluding election law that allowed election workers to challenge the citizenship \n15  status of any voter, question whether the voter was “a native or naturalized citizen,” and \n16  require  naturalized  citizens  to  produce  a  naturalization  certificate,  was  facially \n17  discriminatory). The Voting Laws are facially neutral as to race, ethnicity, and national \n18  origin. \n19  Because the Voting Laws are facially neutral, Plaintiffs must show that the Voting \n20  Laws were “motivated by” a discriminatory purpose. Vill. of Arlington Heights 429 U.S. \n21  at 265–66; see Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 603 (2018) (explaining burden of proof is on \n22  the plaintiff). “The central inquiry in any disparate  treatment claim under the Equal \n23  Protection Clause is whether ‘an invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor’ \n24  in some government action.” Ballou v. McElvain, 29 F.4th 413, 424 (9th Cir. 2022) \n25  (quoting Ave. 6E Invs., LLC v. City of Yuma, Ariz., 818 F.3d 493, 504 (9th Cir. 2016)); see \n26  Arce, 793 F.3d at 977 (“A plaintiff does not have to prove that the discriminatory purpose \n27  was the sole purpose of the challenged action, but only that it was a ‘motivating factor.’” \n28  (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265–66)). The Court considers the following, “non-\n \n- 100 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  exhaustive  factors”  to  determine  whether  the  Voting  Laws  were  motivated  by  a \n2  discriminatory purpose: \n3  (1) the impact of the official action and whether it bears more heavily on one \nrace than another; (2) the historical background of the decision; (3) the \n4  specific  sequence  of  events  leading  to  the  challenged  action;  (4)  the \ndefendant’s departures from normal procedures or substantive conclusions; \n5  and (5) the relevant legislative or administrative history. \n6  Arce, 793 F.3d at 977 (citing Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68). Plaintiffs must \n7  overcome the “strong ‘presumption of good faith’” the Court affords to the Arizona \n8  Legislature. United States v. Carrillo-Lopez, 68 F.4th 1133, 1139 (9th Cir. 2023) (quoting \n9  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995)); see Abbott, 585 U.S. at 603.   \n10        i.  Historical Background \n11  Beginning with the second Arlington Heights factor, Arizona does have a long \n12  history of discriminating against people of color. This includes the State’s literacy tests that \n13  effectively precluded Native American and Latino voters from voting, in addition to voter \n14  roll purges that created barriers for people of color to re-register to vote. But “unless \n15  historical evidence is reasonably contemporaneous with the challenged decision, it has \n16  little probative value.” McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 298 n.20 (1987). Arizona has \n17  not employed literacy tests since the 1970s, and Arizona’s preclearance requirements under \n18  section 5 of the VRA is the most recent evidence of voter discrimination that Plaintiffs’ \n19  experts cite. Despite these examples of past discrimination, the Court continues to presume \n20  good faith on behalf of the 55th Legislature because “[p]ast discrimination cannot, in the \n21  manner of original sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.” Abbott, \n22  585 U.S. at 603 (citation omitted). More precisely, “[t]he ‘historical background’ of a \n23  legislative enactment is ‘one evidentiary source’ relevant to the question of intent.” Id. at \n24  603–04 (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267) (emphasis added). And neither Dr. \n25  Chang nor Dr. Burton identified a persuasive nexus between Arizona’s history of animosity \n26  toward marginalized communities and the Legislature’s enactment of the Voting Laws. C.f. \n27  League of Women Voters of Fla., 66 F.4th at 923 (disapproving of district court’s overt \n28  reliance on the state’s discriminatory history that was not sufficiently contemporaneous \n \n- 101 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  with the legislation at issue). \n2      ii.  Events Preceding the Voting Laws and Legislative History \n3  Regarding precipitating events, the Legislature enacted the Voting Laws on the \n4  heels of unsubstantiated voter fraud claims following a victory for President Biden in \n5  Arizona by a margin of 10,457 votes during the 2020 presidential election. (See, e.g., Pls.’ \n6  Stip. No. 154; Minnite Tr. 1597:5–11.) The Arizona Senate’s subsequent audit of the \n7  election  failed  to  reveal  any  voter  fraud  in  Arizona,  as  did  the  Attorney  General’s \n8  investigation into allegations of voter fraud. (See, e.g., Minnite Tr. 1589:17–1592:14 \n9  (recounting the Elections Integrity Unit’s efforts to uncover instances of non-citizen voting \n10  in the 2020 election); see Ex. 401 (letter explaining Elections Integrity Unit’s inability to \n11  find evidence to substantiate allegations of fraudulent ballots in Pima County).) \n12  Turning to the Voting Laws’ legislative history, because legislators rarely publicize \n13  their discriminatory motives on the record, the Court considers whether legislators have \n14  “‘camouflaged’ their intent.” Arce, 793 F.3d at 978 (citation omitted). Nothing in the \n15  legislative hearings evince a motive to discriminate against voters based on race or national \n16  origin. See Carrillo-Lopez, 68 F.4th at 1148 (finding no “racist or derogatory language \n17  regarding Mexicans or other Central and South Americans” evincing discriminatory intent \n18  in a 925-page Senate Report). Instead, the hearings and the substance of the Voting Laws \n19  indicate that the Voting Laws are in many ways the progeny of Arizona’s prior effort to \n20  require DPOC for all Arizona voters through Proposition 200. The Supreme Court’s \n21  decision in ITCA and the LULAC Consent Decree curtailed the State’s power to require \n22  DPOC for Federal-Only Voters, regardless of whether voters registered with the State Form \n23  or Federal Form. See ITCA, 570 U.S. at 12; (LULAC Consent Decree at PX 024-8 to -10, \n24  -13 to -14.) During the hearings regarding H.B. 2492, legislators supporting the bills \n25  vocalized concerns with the marked increase in Federal-Only Voters following the LULAC \n26  Consent Decree. (H.B. 2492 House Gov. Comm. Tr. at PX 054-3 to -4.) The Legislature’s \n27  passage of the bill attempted to revive the DPOC Requirement for State Form users in light \n28  of ITCA’s pronouncement that “States retain the flexibility to design and use their own \n \n- 102 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  registration  forms”  and  for  Federal  Form  users  by  first  “establishing  the  applicant’s \n2  ineligibility” to side-step the NVRA’s “accept and use” requirement. ITCA, 570 U.S. at 12, \n3  16; (see H.B. 2492 House Gov. Comm. Tr. at PX 054-9 to -10, -17 to -19.)  \n4  The  Legislature’s  concern  with  Federal-Only  Voters  paralleled  some  public \n5  sentiment that non-citizens were able to vote by falsely attesting to U.S. citizenship. \n6  (Connor Tr. 382:12–383:25 (describing public comments regarding 2023 EPM that “voters \n7  should  be  citizens”);  Quezada  Tr.  877:14–878:17  (explaining  the  general  public’s \n8  “commentary” was that non-citizens were voting).) The public’s concerns regarding non-\n9  citizen voting, even if unsubstantiated, does not exhibit “[t]he presence of community \n10  animus” for the Court to impute a discriminatory motive to the Legislature. Ave. 6E Invs., \n11  818 F.3d at 504; c.f. SoCal Recovery, LLC v. City of Costa Mesa, No. SACV 18-1304-\n12  JVS(JDEx), 2023 WL 8263377, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2023) (noting evidence of \n13  community  animus  where  residents  cited  “mayhem  and  violence”  and  “crime  and \n14  homelessness” to oppose sober living homes, which the city referenced in permit denials).  \n15  Furthermore, the Free Enterprise Club disseminated lobbying materials by email to \n16  Arizona legislators that described how the Voting Laws would prevent “illegals” from \n17  voting in Arizona elections. (Ex. 602.) “[T]he use of ‘code words’ may demonstrate \n18  discriminatory intent,” and the term “illegals” can evince racial animus for members of the \n19  Latino community in Arizona. Ave. 6E Invs., 818 F.3d at 505; (see Quezada Tr. 867:18–\n20  868:9 (explaining the term “illegals” in the voting context is typically used to refer to non-\n21  citizens  from  Latin  descent  and  that  the  term  “undocumented”  is  less  offensive  for \n22  individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States); Burton Tr. 1453:17–1454:25 \n23  (explaining that the term “illegals” in the voting context can refer to non-citizens, or \n24  minorities perceived as untrustworthy).) Because Free Enterprise Club helped author the \n25  Voting Laws, the Court weighs the organization’s coded appeals as some evidence of \n26  community animus. Ave. 6E Invs., 818 F.3d at 505. But while community animus “can \n27  support a finding of discriminatory motives by government officials,” Plaintiffs presented \n28  no persuasive evidence that the Legislature relied on the Free Enterprise Club’s coded \n \n- 103 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  appeals, nor that the Legislature enacted the Voting Laws to prevent anyone other than \n2  non-citizens from voting. Id. at 504; c.f. Gonzalez v. Douglas, 269 F. Supp. 3d 948, 967 \n3  (D. Ariz. 2017) (citing officials’ use of  the terms  “‘Raza,’ ‘un-American,’  ‘radical,’ \n4  ‘communist,’ ‘Aztlan,’ and ‘M.E.Ch.a,’” as  code words for  Mexican Americans and \n5  “concepts of foreignness and political radicalism” during public debates of a House bill).  \n6  Plaintiffs  contend  that  Senator  Borrelli  would  frequently  make  derogatory \n7  comments about Latino voters to Senator Quezada during Senate Judiciary Committee \n8  meetings. Even assuming Senator Borrelli expressed discriminatory remarks, Plaintiffs \n9  may not impute his motives to the other individual legislators or the Arizona Legislature \n10  as a whole. As the Supreme Court has cautioned: \nInquiries into congressional motives or purposes are a hazardous matter. \n11 \nWhen the issue is simply the interpretation of legislation, the Court will look \nto statements by legislators for guidance as to the purpose of the legislature, \n12 \nbecause the benefit to sound decision-making in this circumstance is thought \nsufficient  to  risk  the  possibility  of  misreading  Congress’  purpose.  It  is \n13 \nentirely a different matter when we are asked to void a statute that is, under \nwell-settled criteria, constitutional on its face, on the basis of what fewer than \n14 \na handful of Congressmen said about it. What motivates one legislator to \nmake a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of \n15 \nothers to enact it, and the stakes are sufficiently high for us to eschew \nguesswork. \n16 \n17  United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383–84 (1968); see also DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2349–\n18  50 (agreeing with district court’s findings that “no evidence [indicated] the legislature as a \n19  whole was imbued with racial motives”). And while Senator Quezada testified as to his \n20  reasons for voting against the Voting Laws, “the concerns expressed by political opponents \n21  during the legislative process are not reliable evidence of legislative intent.” League of \n22  Women Voters of Fla., 66 F.4th at 940. \n23  iv.  Impact on Minority and Naturalized Voters \n24    Evidence of a law’s disparate impact is generally insufficient alone to evidence a \n25  legislature’s discriminatory motive. Carrillo-Lopez, 68 F.4th at 1141 (explaining that a \n26  court may infer a discriminatory motive from disproportionate impacts in the “rare cases” \n27  where the effects of the challenged action are unequivocally related to race). As discussed \n28  in the Court’s section 2 analysis, Plaintiffs have not shown that the Voting Laws will have \n \n- 104 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  any significant discriminatory impact based on naturalization status, race, or ethnicity. \n2  First, the difference in registration rates by race and ethnicity, with one-third of a percent \n3  of White voters and two-thirds of a percent of minority voters registered as Federal-Only \n4  Voters, is “small in absolute terms.” DNC, 141 S. Ct. at 2345. Second, while it is possible \n5  that SAVE and MVD could return outdated citizenship information for a small number of \n6  naturalized citizens, these database checks without more do not materially affect Full-\n7  Ballot Voters who have already provided DPOC. Of course, 65 naturalized Federal-Only \n8  voters will likely be flagged as non-citizens and may be required to produce DPOC, but \n9  considering this accounts for just 0.001% of all voters, the impact of these checks is \n10  markedly small. (See MVD Non-Citizen Records.) Setting aside the racial, ethnic and \n11  nationality composition of Federal-Only Voters, Plaintiffs offered testimony to show that \n12  minority voters are more likely to lack, and encounter more barriers to furnishing, DPOC \n13  than White voters. (See, e.g., Tiwamangkala Tr. 1273:22–1274:4 (AANHPI community); \n14  Nitschke Tr. 469:8–470:3 (out-of-state college students).) But there is no quantifiable \n15  evidence regarding the rate at which minority voters both lack and are unable to afford \n16  DPOC. The same is true for the number of naturalized citizens who lack both their \n17  naturalization certificate and their immigration number.  \n18  In addition, Plaintiffs did not show that the Arizona Legislature enacted the Voting \n19  Laws because of any impact on minority voters or naturalized citizens. For example, it is \n20  common sense that the Voting Laws’ MVD checks would be substantially more likely to \n21  return information of non-citizenship for naturalized citizens who possess a foreign-type \n22  license, as compared to native-born citizens who are ineligible to receive a foreign-type \n23  license at all. This result “does not prove that penalizing such individuals was a purpose of \n24  this legislation.” Carrillo-Lopez, 68 F.4th at 1153 (concluding district court erred in relying \n25  on evidence of 8 U.S.C. § 1326’s disparate impact on Mexicans, which criminalizes the \n26  reentry of a removed alien, without more evidence of animus because “the clear geographic \n27  reason for disproportionate impact on Mexicans and other Central and South Americans \n28  undermines any inference of discriminatory motive”).  \n \n- 105 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs make much of what the Arizona Legislature did not evaluate when passing \n2  the Voting Laws, specifically the impact on voters based on national origin, race, ethnicity, \n3  age, or socioeconomic status. Community stakeholders had an opportunity to oppose the \n4  Voting Laws on the record, most of whom emphasized the DPOC Requirement’s disparate \n5  impacts  on  Federal-Only  Voters  and  the  DPOR  Requirement’s  impacts  on  Native \n6  American voters. (See, e.g., Ex. 61 at PX 061-8 to -20.) When explaining his vote against \n7  H.B. 2492 during the same hearing, Senator Quezada warned the Senators that the bill \n8  would have a discriminatory impact on people of color. (Id. at PX 061-33 to -35.) But \n9  Plaintiffs must show that the Arizona Legislature enacted the Voting Laws “at least in part \n10  ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” \n11  Carrillo-Lopez, 68 F.4th at 1139 (quoting Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, \n12  279 (1979)). The Legislature’s failure to adequately consider the Voting Laws’ impact on \n13  people of color or naturalized citizens or decision to pass the Voting Laws notwithstanding \n14  the potential impact on these voters is insufficient to show a discriminatory motive. Id.  \n15        v.  Procedural and Substantive Departures \n16  Finally, Plaintiffs adduced no persuasive evidence of procedural departures during \n17  the Arizona Legislature’s enactment of H.B. 2492. Plaintiffs contend that the House Rules \n18  Committee knowingly passed the bill after the Committee’s attorney opined that the bill \n19  was likely unconstitutional and preempted by the NVRA. But the Rules Committee was \n20  not bound by this opinion, nor did the Rules Committee attorney indicate that H.B. 2492 \n21  was unconstitutionally discriminatory as relevant to Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth and Fifteenth \n22  Amendment claims. (See, e.g., Toma Dep. 174:3–174:10 (explaining the Rules Committee \n23  ultimately decides whether a bill “moves forward”)); c.f. Ave. 6E Invs., 818 F.3d at 507 \n24  (finding city’s plausible departure from normal procedures by ignoring “the unanimous \n25  recommendation”  of  the  city’s  Planning  and  Zoning  Commission  could  evince \n26  discriminatory intent “particularly when, as here, that recommendation is consonant with \n27  the municipality’s general zoning requirements and plaintiffs proffer additional evidence \n28  of animus” (emphasis added)).  \n \n- 106 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Regarding H.B. 2243, Governor Ducey vetoed the bill for lacking “sufficient due \n2  process” protections. Legislators collaborated with the Governor’s office specifically to \n3  address the Governor’s due process concerns. (Toma Dep. 232:19–233:18, 234:14–21, \n4  235:7–20.) Senator Petersen then introduced the language of H.B. 2617 into H.B. 2243, \n5  albeit with several substantive changes, such as reducing the opportunity to provide DPOC \n6  from 90 to 35 days. And while the legislators could not name a separate voting bill during \n7  their  depositions  that  was  successfully  amended  in  a  similar  manner  to  HB.  2243, \n8  amendments to existing bills are common at the close of a legislative session. (Toma Dep. \n9  237:8–239:3 (explaining unsuccessful attempt to pass a different vetoed voting bill through \n10  a separate germane bill on the last day of the legislative session); Petersen Dep. 319:3–24, \n11  333:17–334:2.) The speed with which the Legislature passed H.B. 2243 as amended was \n12  not so abrupt as to infer an improper motive, considering the Legislature had previously \n13  passed H.B. 2617 through the ordinary legislative process. Abbott, 585 U.S. at 610 & n.23 \n14  (“[W]e do not see how the brevity of the legislative process can give rise to an inference \n15  of  bad  faith—and  certainly  not  an  inference  that  is  strong  enough  to  overcome  the \n16  presumption of legislative good faith.”). \n17  Substantively,  Arizona  has  required  DPOC  since  2005,  and  the  Voting  Laws \n18  supplement this requirement to ensure that non-citizens do not register to vote or remain \n19  on the voter rolls. This includes expanding county recorders’ existing use of SAVE and the \n20  MVD database to also identify existing registered non-citizens. Similarly, H.B. 2243’s 35-\n21  day notice procedure is not a departure from prior Arizona law, as it adopts the 2019 EPM’s \n22  35-day period for a voter to prove citizenship after attesting to non-citizenship on a juror \n23  questionnaire. (2019 EPM at PX 006-50 to -51.) And while the Court concluded above that \n24  the Birthplace Requirement violates the Materiality Provision, the Legislature’s decision \n25  to mandate birthplace on the State Form is consistent with Arizona’s existing practice of \n26  collecting this information from voters,  even if providing birthplace  was historically \n27  optional.  \n28  Having considered the totality of these factors, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs \n \n- 107 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  failed to show that the Voting Laws were enacted with a discriminatory purpose. \n2  III.  CONCLUSION \n3    Non-US  Plaintiffs  may  enforce  § 10101  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act.  Requiring \n4  individuals who register to vote using the State Form to include the individual’s state or \n5  country of birth violates the Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act. H.B. 2243’s \n6  Reason to Believe Provision also violates the Civil Rights Act, as well as section 8(b) of \n7  the NVRA because the provision will result in the investigation of only naturalized citizens \n8  based on county recorders’ subjective beliefs that a naturalized individual is a non-citizen. \n9  In  addition,  requiring  individuals  registering  to  vote  with  the  State  Form  to  include \n10  documentary proof of residence to register for federal elections violates sections 6 and 7 of \n11  the NVRA. However, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to show that the Voting Laws’ \n12  remaining  citizenship  investigation  procedures,  DPOC  requirements,  and  registration \n13  cancellation procedures violate the NVRA or the VRA. Nor do these provisions impose an \n14  undue burden on the right to vote or violate the equal protection and due process guarantees \n15  of the U.S. constitution. Finally, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs failed to show that the \n16  Voting Laws were enacted with any discriminatory purpose. \n17    IT IS ORDERED declaring that A.R.S. § 16-121.01(A) violates § 10101(a)(2)(B) \n18  of the Civil Rights Act by denying Arizonans the right to vote based on errors or omissions \n19  that are not material to determining Arizonan’s eligibility to vote. Arizona may not reject \n20  State Form registrations that lack an individual’s state or country of birth and must register \n21  an individual if that individual is found eligible to vote. \n22    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  declaring  that  A.R.S.  § 16-165(I)  violates \n23  § 10101(a)(2)(A) of the Civil Rights Act and section 8(b) of the NVRA by subjecting \n24  naturalized citizens whom county recorders have reason to believe are non-citizens to \n25  SAVE checks, which is a different standard, practice, or procedure than that applied to \n26  native-born citizens. Arizona may not conduct SAVE checks on any registered voter whom \n27  county recorders have reason to believe are a non-citizen. But Arizona may conduct SAVE \n28  checks on registered voters who have provided DPOC. See A.R.S. § 16-165(I). \n \n- 108 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  declaring  that  A.R.S.  § 16-121.01(A)  violates \n2  sections 6 and 7 of the NVRA by requiring Arizonans who register with the State Form to \n3  provide documentary proof of residence. Arizona may not reject State Form registrations \n4  that are not accompanied by documentary proof of residence but must register an individual \n5  without proof of residence as a Federal-Only Voter if that individual is otherwise eligible \n6  to vote.  \n7   \n8      Dated this 29th day of February, 2024. \n9   \n \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 109 - ",
