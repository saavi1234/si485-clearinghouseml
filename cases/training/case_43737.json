    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a third-party candidate's access to the ballot in Ohio.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 6, 2008, the Libertarian Party of Ohio (LPO), an alternative political party, its chairman, its candidates for President and Vice President of the United States, one of its candidates for the United States Congress, and one of its candidates for the Ohio legislature filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging that they had been improperly denied access to the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Ohio.&nbsp; They argued that Ohio's Directive 2007-09, which purported to require an alternative political party such as the LPO to file 20,114 petition signatures no later than November 26, 2007 in order to qualify to run candidates in 2008, unduly burdened their rights to cast their votes effectively, to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, and to have equal protection of the laws, and that such ballot access restrictions were prohibited by Articles I and II of the United States Constitution.&nbsp; They also asserted that Ohio had no state interest which made it necessary to burden plaintiffs' rights. &nbsp;Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging claims under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Articles I and II of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; Plaintiffs also sought attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988.&nbsp; Plaintiffs were represented by private attorneys Gary Sinawski and Mark Brown.&nbsp; Defendant Jennifer Brunner, the Ohio Secretary of State, was Ohio's chief election officer. The case was assigned to Judge Edmund A. Sargus, Jr.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case stems from an earlier case involving the LPO, <em>Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell</em>, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006), and the Ohio General Assembly's failure to act following <em>Blackwell.</em>&nbsp;In <em>Blackwell</em>, the Sixth Circuit ruled that Ohio's requirement that political parties nominate their candidates via primary election, together with its requirement that minor parties file a qualifying petition 120 days in advance of the primary election, impose \". . . an unconstitutional burden on the [the LPO's] First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of free association, by effectively preventing it from gaining access to the general election ballot in the twelve months preceding a presidential election.\"&nbsp; 462 F.3d at 582.&nbsp; This ruling left a void in minor party qualifying procedures that could have been addressed by legislation.&nbsp; However, the Ohio General Assembly did not enact remedial legislation, so Ohio's Secretary of State attempted to fill the void by promulgating Directive 2007-09 in May 2007, which purported to require a minor party desirous of fielding candidates in the November 2008 general election to obtain petition signatures equal in number to one-half of one percent of the 2006 gubernatorial vote and to file them at least 100 days before the March 4, 2008 primary election.&nbsp; Thus, the Directive left intact the pre-<em>Blackwell</em> requirement that a minor party nominate its candidates by primary election.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 3, 2008, the LPO sought to qualify for the November 2008 general election ballot by filing a petition containing some 6,545 signatures.&nbsp; In a May 22, 2008 letter, Ohio rejected the petition for failure to comply with Directive 2007-09.&nbsp; On June 6, 2008, the LPO filed its initial complaint challenging Directive 2007-09.&nbsp; On June 16, 2008, the LPO amended its complaint, which became the operative complaint in the case. On the same day, the LPO filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction which asked the court to: 1) grant the LPO access to the November 4, 2008 general election ballot; (2) invalidate the early filing deadline for minor party qualifying petitions imposed by Ohio; and 3) invalidate the requirement that the LPO nominate its candidates via primary election and permitting it to nominate by party caucus or convention.&nbsp; Ohio opposed the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, arguing that Secretary Brunner properly exercised her authority under Ohio law to fill the void left by the <em>Blackwell</em> decision and that it was constitutional for Ohio to require any new party to show that it enjoys a modicum of support before it is granted access to the ballot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After reviewing the parties' briefs and hearing oral argument, Judge Sargus ruled in favor of the LPO on July 17, 2008.&nbsp; The ruling was published at 567 F.Supp.2d 1006 (S.D. Ohio 2008).&nbsp; Recognizing that Ohio has the right to require party candidates for public office to file petitions sufficient in number to demonstrate a modicum of public support, and that such petitions must be filed in advance of an election to ensure an orderly, reliable election, the Court also held that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right of association which is violated by onerous access statutes which prevent third parties and candidates from appearing on the ballot. Further, Articles I and II of the Constitution require that for federal offices such as President, Vice President, and the U.S. House of Representatives, the legislature, not executive officers such as the Secretary of State, must determine the method of elections. While the Court noted Secretary Brunner tried to bring Ohio election law into compliance with the Constitution, the Directive issued by the Secretary suffered from the same deficiencies found in <em>Blackwell</em>, and, as to the federal offices, was in conflict with Articles I and II of the Constitution.&nbsp; The Court applied the four factors applicable to preliminary injunctions: (1) plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction; (3) the probability that granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest will be advanced by issuing the injunction.&nbsp; Applying these factors, the Court first held that the LPO was likely to prevail on the merits of its constitutional claims.&nbsp; Only the legislature can establish methods for the election of federal officers.&nbsp; Moreover, the Directive imposed unconstitutional burdens on First Amendment rights of association, the same problem the Sixth Circuit found in <em>Blackwell</em>.&nbsp; The Court was not persuaded by Ohio's argument that the burdens were necessary to ensure orderly elections.&nbsp; Quoting <em>Blackwell</em>, the Court held: \"[t]his system serves to protect the two major parties at the expense of political dialogue and expression, which not justified, much less compelling.\" 567 F. Supp.2d at 1014 (quoting <em>Blackwell,</em> 462 F.3d at 594).&nbsp; Further, no federal court has upheld a ballot restriction requiring minor parties to file party petitions more than eleven months in advance of a general election.&nbsp; In fact, in <em>Williams v. Rhodes</em>, 393 U.S. 23 (1968), the Supreme Court specifically rejected Ohio's February filing deadline for minor parties to qualify for the November election.</p>\r\n<p>Next, the Court found that denial of access to the ballot irreparably harmed the LPO and its candidates.&nbsp; The Court also rejected Ohio's argument that the candidates and the general public would be harmed if the LPO was allowed access to the ballot.&nbsp; As in B<em>lackwell</em>, there was no evidence that Ohio voters \"would be flummoxed by a ballot featuring multiple political parties.\"&nbsp; 567 F. Supp.2d at 1015 (quoting <em>Blackwell</em>, 462 F.3d at 594).&nbsp; Thus, the court concluded that each of the four factors for preliminary injunctions weighed in favor of the LPO. In granting the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the Court ruled that the LPO candidates must be placed on the 2008 general election ballot for the state of Ohio and that the individual plaintiffs be identified as candidates of the LPO.&nbsp; The Court stayed its order for ten days in order to allow Ohio to pursue expedited review at the Sixth Circuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ohio did not pursue an appeal and instead answered the Amended Complaint.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Court granted motions to consolidate two other ballot access cases with <em>LPO v. Brunner</em>: (1) <em>Moore v. Brunner</em>, 2:08-cv-224 (S.D. Ohio) and <em>McKinney v. Brunner</em>, 2:08-cv-819 (S.D. Ohio).&nbsp; The parties subsequently entered into a settlement, the terms of which are contained in a Consent Decree.&nbsp; According to the Consent Decree, entered on July 30, 2009, on May 27, 2009, Ohio formally withdrew Directive 2007-09 and LPO agreed to dismiss its case with prejudice.&nbsp; The Consent Decree also states that the LPO would be entitled to its reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988(b). The LPO was further directed to file a motion for an award of costs under Rule 54 and attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988(b) with the Court within 14 days after the Consent Decree is incorporated into a Final Judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2010, the Court entered an award of attorneys' fees and costs in <em>Moore v. Brunner</em> and L<em>PO v. Brunner</em> as follows:&nbsp; (1) $19,968.75 in fees and $350 in costs in <em>Moore v. Brunner</em>; and (2) $38,000 in fees and $2,412 in costs in <em>LPO v.

    "summary_short": "In 2008, the Libertarian Party of Ohio (LPO), an alternative political party, its chairman, its candidates for President and Vice President of the United States, one of its candidates for the United States Congress, and one of its candidates for the Ohio legislature filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging that they had been improperly denied access to the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Ohio.  They argued that Ohio's Directive 2007-09, which purported to require an alternative political party such as the LPO to file 20,114 petition signatures no later than November 26, 2007 in order to qualify to run candidates in 2008, unduly burdened their rights to cast their votes effectively, to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, and to have equal protection of the laws, and that such ballot access restrictions are prohibited by Articles I and II of the United States Constitution.  They also asserted that Ohio had no state interest which makes it necessary to burden plaintiffs' rights.  The Court granted a preliminary injunction in the LPO's favor in July 2008.  The parties settled the case in 2009, with Ohio agreeing to withdraw Directive 2007-09.  In 2010, the Court awarded the LPO attorneys' fees and costs.   The case ended with the award of attorneys' fees and costs.",

ROOT, MARK NOBLE\nand MARGARET A. LEECH,\nPlaintiffs, Case No. 08-555\nv. JUDGE SARGUS\nJENNIFER BRUNNER, in her MAGISTRATE JUDGE KING\nOfficial Capacity as Ohio Secretary\nof State,\nDefendant.\n_____________________________/\nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nINTRODUCTION\n1. The plaintiffs are an alternative political party, its chairman, its candidates\nfor President and Vice President of the United States, one of its candidates for the United\nStates Congress, and one of its candidates for the Ohio legislature.  The individual\nplaintiffs also sue in their capacity as electors who want to support and vote for the\npolitical party plaintiff and its candidates for public office in the general election\nscheduled to be held on November 4, 2008.  The defendant is the chief elections officer\nof Ohio.\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 5 Filed: 06/16/08 Page: 2 of 8  PAGEID #: 19\n2. On February 23, 2008 the plaintiffs held a convention at which they\nnominated plaintiffs Noble, Leech and other candidates for public office in the 2008\ngeneral election.\n3. On March 3, 2008 representatives of the plaintiffs filed with defendant a\npetition containing some 6,545 signatures in an attempt to qualify plaintiff Libertarian\nParty of Ohio (“LPO”) as a minor political party entitled to run candidates for public\noffice in 2008.  \n4. By letter to plaintiff Knedler dated May 22, 2008 (Exhibit A hereto),\ndefendant rejected the petition as not in compliance with defendant’s Directive 2007-09,\nissued on May 21, 2007 (Exhibit B hereto), which purported to require a party such as the\nLPO to file 20,114 petition signatures no later than November 26, 2007 in order to\nqualify to run candidates in 2008.\n5. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief from defendant’s refusal to\nvalidate their petition and from the ballot access restrictions on minor political parties\npromulgated by defendant in Directive 2007-09.  They assert that defendant’s refusal to\ngrant them access to the November 4, 2008 general election ballot unduly burdens their\nrights to cast their votes effectively, to associate for the advancement of political beliefs,\nand to have equal protection of the laws, and that such ballot access restrictions are\nprohibited by Articles I and II of the United States Constitution.  They further assert that\nOhio has no state interest which makes it necessary to burden plaintiffs’ rights.\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 5 Filed: 06/16/08 Page: 3 of 8  PAGEID #: 20\nJURISDICTIION AND VENUE\n6. Federal jurisdiction is claimed under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 and 42\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n7. Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S.C.§ 1391(b).\nPARTIES\n8. Plaintiff LPO is an affiliation of voters formed for the purpose of\ninfluencing public policy by a variety of means, which include running candidates for\npublic office and disseminating its views on policy issues through its candidates’\ncampaigns.  The LPO was founded in or about 1972 and is the Ohio affiliate of the\nnational Libertarian Party.  It seeks to become a minor political party within the meaning\nof Ohio Rev. Code § 3501.01(F)(3).\n9. Plaintiff Kevin Knedler resides in Concord, in Delaware County, and is the\nLPO’s chairman.\n10. Plaintiffs Bob Barr and Wayne A. Root are the LPO’s candidates for\nPresident and Vice President of the United States, respectively, having been nominated\nby the national Libertarian Party as its candidates for those offices at the Libertarian\nnational convention on May 25, 2008.\n11. Plaintiff Mark Noble resides in Columbus, in Franklin County, and wants to\nbe listed on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot as the LPO’s candidate for\nRepresentative in Congress from the 15th congressional district, having been nominated\nfor that office at an LPO convention on February 23, 2008.\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 5 Filed: 06/16/08 Page: 4 of 8  PAGEID #: 21\n12. Plaintiff Margaret A. Leech resides in Miami Township, in Clermont\nCounty, and wants to be listed on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot as the\nLPO’s candidate for State Senator from the 14th senate district, having been nominated\nfor that office at an LPO convention on February 23, 2008.\n13. Defendant Jennifer Brunner is the Ohio Secretary of State and, pursuant to\nOhio Rev. Code § 3501.04, is the chief elections officer of Ohio.\nFACTS\n14. Ohio law provides in relevant part as follows:\na.. Political parties nominate their candidates for public office via\nprimary elections.  Oh. Const. art. V sec. 7.\nb. Primary elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday\nin May of each year, except that in years in which a presidential primary election is held,\nprimary elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March.  Ohio\nRev. Code §§ 3501.01(E)(1) and (2).  The most recent Ohio primary election was held on\nMarch 4, 2008.\nc. A political party whose candidate for governor or nominees for\npresidential elector received at least five percent of the votes cast for governor or for\nnominees for presidential elector in the most recent general election has automatic access\nto the ballot in the next primary and general elections.  Ohio Rev. Code § 3517.01(A).\nd. A party which received less than five percent of that vote may\nqualify to nominate candidates for public office (via primary election) by obtaining\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 5 Filed: 06/16/08 Page: 5 of 8  PAGEID #: 22\npetition signatures of qualified electors equal in number to at least one percent of the total\nvote cast for governor or for nominees for presidential elector in the most recent general\nelection, and by filing such petition signatures with defendant at least 120 days before the\nnext primary election.  Ohio Rev. Code §§ 3501.01(F)(3), 3517.012 and 3501.01(E).\n15. In the most recent general election, held in November 2006, 4,022,754\nvotes were cast for Governor of Ohio.  Were it not for the Sixth Circuit’s decision in\nLibertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006) (see infra), the\nsignature requirement for a petition to qualify a political party to nominate candidates at\nthe March 4, 2008 primary election would have been 40,228 (4,022,754 x 0.10 =\n40,227.54), and the deadline for filing such petition would have been November 5, 2007.\n16. In Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, Id., the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the combination of Ohio’s requirement that\npolitical parties nominate their candidates via primary election and its requirement that\nminor parties file a qualifying petition 120 days in advance of the primary election\nimposes “... an unconstitutional burden on [the LPO’s] First and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights of free association, by effectively preventing it from gaining access to the general\nelection ballot in the twelve months preceding a presidential election.”\n17. To date, the Ohio legislature has not amended Ohio law to fill the void in\nminor party qualifying procedures created by the Sixth Circuit’s decision.\n18. On May 21, 2007 the defendant issued Directive 2007-09 to the county\nboards of elections (Exhibit B), which provided, inter alia, that legal recognition and\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 5 Filed: 06/16/08 Page: 6 of 8  PAGEID #: 23\nballot access would be granted to any political party which obtained petition signatures of\nqualified electors equal in number to one-half of one percent of the total number of votes\ncast for governor in the 2006 general election, or 20,114 signatures (4,022,754 x 0.005 =\n20,113.77), and by filing such petition with defendant at least 100 days before the March\n4, 2008 primary election, i.e., by November 26, 2007.\n19. By administrative fiat, Directive 2007-09 purports to substitute a new\nrequirement that a one-half percent petition be filed 100 days before the next primary\nelection for the pre-Libertarian Party v. Blackwell requirement that a one percent petition\nbe filed 120 days before the primary, and leaves intact the pre-Libertarian Party v.\nBlackwell requirement that minor parties nominate via primary election.\n20. On February 23, 2008 the LPO held a convention at which plaintiffs Noble\nand Leech were nominated as candidates for public offices via convention as set forth in\n¶¶ 11 and 12, above.\n21. On March 3, 2008 representatives of the plaintiffs filed with defendant a\npetition containing some 6,545 signatures in an attempt to qualify the LPO as a minor\npolitical party entitled to run candidates for public office in the 2008 general election.\n22. By letter to plaintiff Knedler dated May 22, 2008 (Exhibit A), defendant\nrejected the petition as not in compliance with Directive 2007-09 (Exhibit B).\nCLAIMS\n23. Plaintiffs state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States in that the defendant’s refusal to\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 5 Filed: 06/16/08 Page: 7 of 8  PAGEID #: 24\ngrant them access to the November 2008 general election ballot, together with the\nrestrictions on ballot access for minor political parties contained in Directive 2007-09,\nimpair plaintiffs’ rights to cast their votes effectively and to associate politically,\nincluding their “constitutional right “... to create and develop [a] new political part[y],”\nNorman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288 (1992), and such impairment of plaintiffs’ rights\ncannot be justified by a sufficient state interest.\n24. Plaintiffs state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Articles I and II of the\nConstitution of the United States in that Articles I and II prohibit defendant from enacting\nlaws regulating federal elections.\n25. Plaintiffs state a claim for attorney’s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\nOTHER AVERMENTS\n26. By refusing to grant plaintiffs access to the ballot, and by enforcing the\nrestrictions on minor party ballot access about which plaintiffs complain, defendant is\nacting under color of state law to deprive plaintiffs of speech, voting and associational\nrights secured by the First and Fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United\nStates.  Defendant is therefore liable to plaintiffs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nRELIEF REQUESTED\n27. WHEREFORE, plaintifffs request the following relief:\na. a declaration that defendant’s refusal to grant plaintiffs access to the\nNovember 2008 general election ballot is unconstitutional;\nb. a declaration that the restrictions on ballot access  promulgated by\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 5 Filed: 06/16/08 Page: 8 of 8  PAGEID #: 25\ndefendant in Directive 2007-09 (Exhibit B) are unconstitutional;\nc. a declaration that defendant is in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\nd. preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting defendant from\nrefusing to grant plaintiffs access to the 2008 general election ballot or, in the alternative,\nprohibiting defendant from enforcing the ballot access restrictions in Directive 2007-09;\ne. reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988;\nf. such other and further relief as may be just and proper.\nDated: June 16, 2008\nGary Sinawski\n180 Montague Street 26th Floor\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\nTelephone: (516) 971-7783\nTelefax: (212) 581-1516\nE-mail: gsinawski@aol.com\ns/Mark Brown                          \nMark Brown, Trial Counsel\nOhio Registration No. 0081941\n303 East Broad Street\nColumbus, OH 43215\nTelephone: (614) 236-6590\nTelefax: (614) 236-6956\nE-mail: mbrown@law.capital.edu\nAttorneys for Plaintiffs",

ROOT, MARK NOBLE\nand MARGARET A. LEECH,\nPlantiffs, Case No. 2:08-cv-555\nv. JUDGE SARGUS\nJENNIFER BRUNNER, in her MAGISTRATE JUDGE KING\nOfficial Capacity as Ohio Secretary\nof State,\nDefendant.\nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF\nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006), the Sixth Circuit  \nstruck down as unconstitutional the combination of Ohio’s requirements that a minor party such\nas the LPO nominate its candidates via primary election and that it qualify for the general election\nballot by filing a petition at least 120 days in advance of the primary which contains a number of\nsignatures equal to one percent of the vote for governor or for presidential electors in the\npreceding general election..  \nIn Directive 2007-09, the defendant left intact the requirement that minor parties nominate\nvia primary election, reduced the signature requirement by one-half, and set a new filing deadline\nof 100 days before the primary instead of 120 days beforehand.  Amended Complaint, Ex. A. \n1\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 2 of 15  PAGEID #: 116\nDirective 2007-09 also provides a new mechanism by which nonmajor party candidates for\npresident and vice president (only) can be listed on the general election ballot with a “party\nidentifier” by submitting a petition that complies with the same signature and filing requirements. \nId.; Defendant’s Memorandum at 3.\nThese cosmetic changes in Ohio’s ballot access requirements do not adequately address\nthe Sixth Circuit’s concerns in Blackwell.  Plaintiffs assert that the new requirements violate their\nFirst Amendment speech and associational rights and run afoul of Articles I and II of the United\nStates Constitution, which prohibit defendant from passing laws regulating federal elections.\nThe issues presented to the Court are the extent to which these features of Ohio ballot\naccess law burden plaintiffs’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the extent to which the\nburdens are justified by a sufficient state interest, and whether the requirements are\nunconstitutional in light of the burdens they impose and the state interests put forward to justify\nthem.  Specifically, plaintiffs challenge Ohio’s requirement that a petition to qualify a minor party\nin a presidential election year be filed in November of the year preceding the election rather than a\nreasonable time before the election and its requirement that a minor party nominate its candidates\nat the primary election held early in March rather than at a primary election, party convention or\ncaucus held later in the year.  Plaintiffs also challenge the new mechanism by which nonmajor\nparty candidates for president and vice president can attain access to the general election ballot\nwith a party identifier.\nDefendant’s arguments in defense of these requirements rest on the untenable assumption\nthat it is constitutionally permissible, in a presidential election year such as this, both to continue\nrequiring that minor parties select their candidates in Ohio’s March primary election and to\ncontinue linking the filing deadline for minor party qualifying petitions to the date of that primary\n2\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 3 of 15  PAGEID #: 117\nelection.  While this linkage may have an internal logic of its own, it was invalidated in Blackwell\nbecause it effectively prevented the LPO from attaining access to the Ohio ballot in the year\npreceding the general election.  \nII. THE INTERESTS PUT FORWARD BY THE STATE TO JUSTIFY THE\nBURDENS ON PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS\nIn justification of the burden on plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights imposed by the\nrequirements promulgated in Directive 2007-09, defendant points to its interests in reducing\nelection- and campaign-related disorder, Defendant’s Memorandum at 4; requiring that a political\nparty or its candidate show a significant modicum of support as a precondition for ballot access,\nDefendant’s Memorandum at 5, 10; meeting the demands of the election calendar, Defendant’s\nMemorandum at 8-9; and requiring political parties to nominate their candidates via primary\nelections, Defendant’s Memorandum at 5-6.  These state interests, defendant argues, render the\nballot access restrictions imposed by Directive 2007-09 “reasonable” and “nondiscriminatory,”\nDefendant’s Memorandum at 4.  As set forth below, plaintiffs disagree.\nA. REDUCING ELECTION- AND CAMPAIGN-RELATED DISORDER\nWhile this is undoubtedly a valid state interest, defendant fails to explain what sort of\ndisorder is anticipated or how its reduction might justify the impairment of plaintiffs First\nAmendment rights.  As an unexplained abstraction, this state interest cannot justify the burden\nwhich Directive 2007-09 imposes on plaintiffs’ rights.\nB. REQUIRING A SIGNIFICANT SHOWING OF SUPPORT\nIt is a matter of public record that plaintiff LPO was founded in 1972, Amended\nComplaint, ¶ 8, has attained qualified-party ballot status in Ohio in the past, and has over the\nyears fielded multiple candidacies for public office.  The Libertarian Party’s candidate for\npresident, plaintiff Barr, has already attained access to the general election ballot in some 31\n3\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 4 of 15  PAGEID #: 118\nstates.  See the July 1, 2008 edition of “Ballot Access News” at www.ballot-access.org.  By\ndefendant’s reckoning, representatives of plaintiff LPO tendered some 6,545 petition signatures\non March 3, 2008 in an attempt to qualify the party for the November 2008 Ohio ballot. \nAmended Complaint, Ex. B.  In other cases where courts have determined that state ballot access\nframeworks are unconstitutional, non-major party candidates seeking access to the ballot have not\nbeen required to file any petition signatures whatsoever.  See the cases cited in plaintiffs’ principal\nmemorandum at 3.  \nThese facts, plaintiffs submit, demonstrate that the LPO has a significant modicum of\npopular support.  \nC. MEETING THE DEMANDS OF THE ELECTION CALENDAR\n Plaintiffs have no quarrel with the state’s need to accomplish the various pre-primary\nelection tasks described in Defendant’s Memorandum at 8-9.  However, defendant’s claim that\nthe need to accomplish these tasks justifies impairing plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights simply\nbegs the question of whether the state can legitimately require the LPO to select its candidates at\nthe March primary election and to file its qualifying petition in November of the year preceding\nthe general election.  In light of Blackwell, the state’s choices would appear to be holding its\npresidential-election-year primaries on a significantly later date; retaining its early primaries for\nmajor parties and holding separate, significantly later primaries for qualified minor parties that\nwish to nominate their candidates later in the election season; or permitting minor parties to select\ntheir candidates at party conventions or caucuses rather than at primary elections.\nD. REQUIRING PARTIES TO NOMINATE VIA PRIMARY ELECTION\nCalifornia Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 572 (2000) held unconstitutional a\nCalifornia proposition that changed the state’s primary election from a closed primary to a\n4\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 5 of 15  PAGEID #: 119\n“blanket primary” in which a voter could vote for any candidate irrespective of the voter’s or\ncandidate’s party affiliation, where the political party-plaintiffs did not want nonmembers to\nparticipate in the selection of their candidates.  In dictum, the Jones Court suggested that states\ncan require parties to nominate by primary.  \nIt does not follow that every primary election format is constitutional.  The Jones court\npointed out that “we have continually stressed that when States regulate parties’ internal\nprocesses they must act within limits imposed by the Constitution,” Id. at 573.  Jones itself is an\nexample; where parties did not want nonmembers to participate in the selection of their\ncandidates, California’s blanket primary exceeded the constitutional limits to which the Court\nreferred.  An earlier case in which the state’s primary election format exceeded those limits is\nSmith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944) (invalidating the Texas Democratic Party’s “whites only”\nprimaries).\nOhio’s March primary, which forces minor parties to select their candidates eight months\nbefore the general election, is unconstitutional for the same reasons that Ohio’s early filing\ndeadline for minor party qualifying petitions is unconstitutional.  Like the early deadline, the early\nprimary prevents new candidacies and new political coalitions from emerging in response to\npolitical developments that occur later in the election cycle.  For example, if a nonmajor party\norganization and its supporters are dissatisfied with the candidates selected by the major parties at\nthe March primary, they ought to have an opportunity to qualify as an alternative political party\nand select alternative candidates to run in the general election under the party’s label.  Ohio,\nhowever, denies them this opportunity without any legitimate state interest in doing so.  As a\nresult, voters who are associated with or are in sympathy with such alternative political\norganizations are deprived of the opportunity to vote for candidates who express their political\n5\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 6 of 15  PAGEID #: 120\nviews.  \nFor the same reasons that a minor party must be permitted to submit a qualifying petition\nlater in the election cycle, it must also be permitted to nominate its candidates later in the cycle if\nit wishes to do so.  While a March primary apparently suits the needs of the major parties, it is\nburdensome to the LPO.  In recognition of the different circumstances and needs of major and\nminor candidacies and parties, the Supreme Court stated in Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442\n(1971) that “[s]ometimes the grossest discrimination can lie in treating things that are different as\nthough they were exactly alike.”\nIf Ohio continues to require minor parties to nominate by primary, and continues to tether\nthe filing deadline for minor party qualifying petitions to the date of its primary, then it must either\nreschedule the primary election in presidential election years to a date that is substantially later\nthan the present March primary date or hold a separate primary election at a later date for\nqualified minor parties.\nIII. BARR’S AND ROOT’S CLAIMS ARE RIPE\nDefendant argues that Barr’s and Root’s claims are untimely because Directive 2007-09\ngives them the option of qualifying to be listed on the November ballot, with a party identifier, by\nfiling a petition containing 20,114 signatures 80 days before the November election.  Defendant’s\nMemorandum at 3.  (Brown and Root could also qualify under Ohio Rev. Code § 3513.257(A) to\nbe listed on the ballot, without a party identifier, by filing 5,000 signatures.)  However, plaintiffs\nseek not merely to qualify Barr and Root for the November ballot but to qualify the LPO to be\nlisted on the ballot along with all of its nominees for public office.  In short, they seek political\nparty status for the LPO.  Having Barr and Root on the ballot is no substitute for having the LPO\nand all of its candidates on the ballot.\n6\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 7 of 15  PAGEID #: 121\nIn addition, the Sixth Circuit, like most courts, has stated that election challenges should\nbe filed as early as possible and not on the eve of an election.  See, e.g., Blankenship v. Blackwell,\n429 F.3d 254, 258 (6th Cir. 2005) (“There is simply no excuse for Appellants’ waiting more than\nseven months to bring their declaratory judgment claim and leaving the federal courts less than a\nmonth before the election to resolve it.”) The plaintiffs’ challenge to defendant’s Directive is thus\nclearly ripe for this reason also. \nIV. DEFENDANT LACKS POWER UNDER OHIO LAW TO REGULATE\nFEDERAL ELECTIONS\nDefendant cites Whitman v. Hamilton County Board of Elections, 778 N.E.2d 32 (Ohio\n2002) for the proposition that she has “great discretion ... to regulate elections via directive.” \nDefendant’s Memorandum at 13.  Whitman, however, merely states that Ohio courts have a “duty\nto defer to the Secretary of State’s interpretation of election law if it is subject to two different,\nbut equally reasonable, interpretations.”  Id. at 35-36.  Defendant cites no authority for the\nproposition that she has the power to write election laws, let alone that she has the authority to\nregulate federal elections.  She fails to explain why the Ohio Attorney General’s 1930 opinion \nthat the Secretary of State only has “discretion ... as chief election officer” to fill in “details which\n[the Legislature] cannot foresee,” and in no case “amplify” the law, see 1930 Ohio A.G. Op. 120,\n122-23, discussed in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum at 16-17, is no longer valid.\nV. DEFENDANT’S RULES FOR NONMAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nAssuming that defendant has the authority under Ohio law to write election laws, her\nattempt at regulating presidential elections is unconstitutional.\nA. THE DEADLINE FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES VIOLATES\nARTICLE II\nThree Justices in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia\n7\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 8 of 15  PAGEID #: 122\nand Thomas) concluded that Article II’s delegation of power to state “Legislatures” prohibits\nstate courts from writing federal election laws.  Two Justices in California Democratic Party v.\nJones, supra, (Justices Stevens and Ginsburg) concluded that Article I’s delegation to state\n“Legislatures” likely prevents states from regulating federal elections through referenda and\ninitiative.  Thus, at least five of the nine Justices sitting on the Court in 2000 believed that the\nfederal Elections Clauses found in Articles I and II require legislative action.  Justices Stevens and\nGinsburg did not join in the Chief Justice’s concurring opinion in Bush v. Gore only because they\nbelieved the Florida Supreme Court was properly interpreting the Florida legislature’s election\nlaws.  Had an agency sought to write a new law, as defendant has done here, Justices Stevens and\nGinsburg (as reflected in their opinion in Jones) would certainly have objected.\nPlaintiffs concede that precedent on the meaning of the Article I and II Election Clauses is\nscant.  This is due in large part to the fact that few states have attempted to regulate federal\nelections through administrative action.  Still, even in the absence of definitive precedent,\ndefendant’s attempt can only be understood as exceeding her constitutional authority.\nFirst, as argued in plaintiffs’ principal memorandum, it is clear that the Constitution’s\nreference to “Legislature” in Article V’s Amendment Clause has a judicially enforceable, federal\nmeaning.  The Supreme Court has found that Article V precludes the use of popular initiatives,\nsee Hawke v. Smith, 253 U.S. 221 (1920), and gubernatorial vetoes, see Smiley v. Holm, 285\nU.S. 355 (1932), and quite likely prohibits the participation of state executive officials in the\nlegislature’s deliberative process.  See Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939) (Court evenly\ndivides over whether a lieutenant governor can cast a tie-breaking vote in the state senate).\nAlthough Articles I and II remain less developed, the Supreme Court’s use of the\nSeventeenth Amendment’s necessity in Hawke, as well as the Chief Justice’s and Justices Stevens,\n8\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 9 of 15  PAGEID #: 123\nScalia, Thomas and Ginsburg’s reliance on Articles I and II in Bush v. Gore and California\nDemocratic Party v. Jones, prove that those Articles’ references to “Legislature” have judicially\nenforceable, federal meanings.  Properly understood, those Articles’ references to “Legislature”\ncan only mean that a state agency cannot write federal election laws.  Defendant’s August 18\ndeadline for presidential candidates thus violates Article II.\nB. DEFENDANT’S AUGUST 18 DEADLINE VIOLATES THE FIRST\nAMENDMENT\nAssuming that defendant has the power to issue deadlines for presidential candidates, and\nhas constitutionally exercised it within the meaning of Article II, her August 18, 2008 deadline\nstill violates Barr’s, Root’s and the Libertarian Party of Ohio’s First Amendment rights.  Because\nBarr and Root could qualify as independent candidates without a party identifier that same day by\npresenting a vastly smaller number of signatures – 5000 to be exact, Ohio Rev. Code §\n3513.257(A) – the Directive can only be understood as an effort to deprive them of their party’s\nendorsement.  Why else would Ohio require four times the number of signatures for a presidential\ncandidate to be listed on the ballot with a party’s label?  \nOrdinarily the justification for requiring more signatures is that a qualified party runs\nmultiple candidates.  But that is not the case under the defendant’s Directive.  Assuming the\nAugust 18 deadline is met, the Libertarian Party can run only its presidential and vice presidential\ncandidates.  Defendant’s measure, which requires four times the number of signatures in order to\nrun under a minor party’s banner, can only be understood as an effort to discourage minor party\nparticipation in Ohio’s elections.  It is designed not to facilitate an orderly election, but to protect\nthe major parties from minor-party competition.  Defendant knows that “the lack of a party label\nhurts a minor party candidate.”  Richard Winger, “Ballot Format: Must Candidates Be Treated\nEqually?,” 45 Cleve. St. L. Rev. 87, 97 (1997); Rosen v. Brown, 970 F.2d 169, 176 (6th Cir.\n9\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 10 of 15  PAGEID #: 124\n1992) (observing that party labels and “voting cues” provided to the major parties “make[] it\nvirtually impossible for Independent candidates to prevail in the general election”).  And her\nDirective seems to be designed with that thought in mind. \nPlaintiffs do not make this charge lightly.  History is on their side.  The Sixth Circuit in\nRosen v. Brown, supra, which struck down an Ohio law barring minor candidates from using the\n“Independent” label, observed that Ohio’s rationalization for the measure was “somewhat\nspecious.”   In reality, Ohio’s distinction was “nothing more than a deliberate attempt by the State\nto protect and guarantee the success of the Democratic and Republican parties.”  Id.  The Court\nfurther observed that “in light of the history of Ohio election laws, the State's claim of compelling\ninterest should be viewed with skepticism.”  Id. at 177.  Similar sentiments were expressed in\nLibertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, supra.\nDefendant’s Directive must be viewed with equal skepticism.  If it were a matter of\nallowing a party’s slate of candidates to run, her 20,000+ signature requirement might be\njustifiable.  Because this is not the case here (the only question is whether Barr and Root will run\nunder the “Libertarian” banner), requiring four times as many signatures cannot be explained as\nanything but an effort to marginalize their candidacy.  This is a far cry from a compelling,\nimportant or even legitimate state interest.  \nAs noted by the Supreme Court in Cook v. Gralike, 531 U.S. 510, 523 (2001), “the\nFramers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations,\nand not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of\ncandidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.”  Even assuming that defendant has the\npower to regulate presidential elections under Article II, she thus cannot attempt to influence\nelectoral outcomes by discouraging party candidates from running under their party’s label.  At\n10\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 11 of 15  PAGEID #: 125\nbare minimum, Ohio must offer some neutral explanation for why Barr and Root can run as\nindependents by submitting 5000 signatures, but may run with a “Libertarian” identifier only by\nsubmitting 15,000+ additional signatures on the same date.  \n“[A] party's defining act is the selection of a candidate and advocacy of that candidate's\nelection by conferring upon him the party’s endorsement.”  Washington State Grange v.\nWashington State Republican Party, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 1197-98 (2008) (Scalia, J., dissenting). \nRestrictions on this defining act must be justified by neutral principles; they must be crafted to\neither insure seriousness, deter frivolous candidacies, foster political stability, or minimize voter\nconfusion.  See, e.g., Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666\n(1998) (holding that publicly owned television station may exclude candidates who were not\n“serious” from debate).  As observed by Justice Stevens in Clingman v. Beaver, 125 S. Ct. 2029,\n2048 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (upholding Oklahoma’s semi-closed primary statute),\n“States do not have a valid interest in manipulating the outcome of elections, in protecting the\nmajor parties from competition, or in stunting the growth of new parties.”  While these remarks\nwere offered in dissent, it seems clear that they encompass the view of a majority of Justices.1 \nThe Court, after all, has ruled on several occasions that government has no “power to dictate\nelectoral outcomes.”  U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, 514 U.S. at 833-34.  See also Cook v.\n1Justice Stevens was joined by Justices Souter and Ginsberg.  125 S.Ct. at 2047.  Justice\nO’Connor’s concurring opinion, which was joined by Justice Breyer, similarly explained that a\nstate’s “asserted interests [in restricting the ballot] [cannot be] merely a pretext for exclusionary\nor anticompetitive restrictions.”  Id. at 2045.  There is no reason to believe, moreover, that any of\nthe other justices would accept the claim that a state has a legitimate interest in preventing\ncompetition.  Justice Thomas in Clingman relied on Oklahoma’s interests in “preserv[ing] the\npolitical parties as viable and identifiable interest groups,” id. at 2039, protecting parties’\n“precious resources,” id. at 2040, minimizing voter confusion, id., and preventing party raiding. \nId.  None of these translates to preventing competition in the general election.  If it did, “[if] ...\nStates were able to protect the incumbent parties in the name of protecting the stability of the\ntwo-party system in general, we might still have the Federalists, the Anti-federalists, or the\nWhigs.”  125 S.Ct. at 2052 n. 7 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n11\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 12 of 15  PAGEID #: 126\nGralike, 531 U.S. 510 (2001) (holding that government cannot use pejorative labels to describe\ncandidates on its ballots, in part, because government has no power to dictate electoral\noutcomes).\nGovernment has no business excluding a candidate’s party label from the official ballot\nbecause it wants to protect the major parties.   Nor does government have any constitutional\nbusiness excluding a candidate’s affiliation with a minor party because of his potential impact on\nthe outcome of the general election.  After all, that is what candidacies are designed to do –\nimpact electoral outcomes.   \nC. DEFENDANT’S DEADLINE FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES\nCANNOT BE SAVED\nEven assuming that a uniform August 18 filing deadline would be constitutional – that is,\nit would survive the First Amendment and Elections Clauses – defendant’s special deadline and\nsignature-collection requirements for presidential candidates must still fall.  As argued in the\nPlaintiffs’ initial brief, defendant’s November deadline for minor-party qualification is clearly\nunconstitutional under Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell.   Upholding her August deadline\nand signature requirement for nonmajor parties’ presidential candidates would mean that\npresidential candidates in Ohio suffer stiffer regulations than any other candidate for statewide\noffice.  Rescuing defendant’s rules for presidential candidates would then result in discrimination\nagainst minor party campaigns for presidential office.  \nThis result would contradict Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 794-95 (1983), which\nruled that states have less power and room to regulate presidential elections: “[I]n a Presidential\nelection a State's enforcement of more stringent ballot access requirements ... has an impact\nbeyond its own borders.  Similarly, the State has a less important interest in regulating Presidential\n12\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 13 of 15  PAGEID #: 127\nelections than statewide or local elections, because the outcome of the former will be largely\ndetermined by voters beyond the State's boundaries.”  \nBecause the Democratic and Republican Parties, moreover, would not be subject to this\nsame restriction – their candidates automatically qualify for the presidential ballot – rescuing\ndefendant’s rules for presidential candidates would subject minor parties to discriminatory\ntreatment that would raise its own set of serious constitutional questions.  See, e.g., Fulani v.\nKrivanek, 973 F.3d 1539 (11th Cir. 1992) (holding that Florida law discriminating against minor\nparties was unconstitutional).  \nOf course, these problems might be avoided by carefully redacting the offensive portions\nof defendant’s Directive, severing her presidential rules, and possibly rewriting them to ease their\ndiscriminatory applications; but none of this falls within the proper role of a federal court.  Federal\ncourts rarely fix unconstitutional state laws.  The Supreme Court has said on numerous occasions\nthat “it is clearly not this Court's province to rewrite a state statute.”  Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502\nU.S. 437, 460 (1992).   \nThe Sixth Circuit in Eubanks v. Wilkinson, 937 F.2d 1118, 1122 (6th Cir. 1991),\nrecognized that “the general federal rule is that courts do not rewrite statutes to create\nconstitutionality.”  The Court observed that this is especially true with state statutes: “This Circuit\nhas adhered to the principle that a federal court ‘has very limited powers in construing state\nstatutes or municipal ordinances.’”  Id. at 1123.  Rather, “a federal court must take the state\nstatute or municipal ordinance as written and cannot find the statute or ordinance constitutional\non the basis of a limiting construction supplied by it rather than a state court.”  \n13\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 14 of 15  PAGEID #: 128\nThe defendant’s Directive, then, must be taken as found.  And as it is written, it is\nunjustifiable and unconstitutional.\nD. PLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE BALLOT\nThe Court has the authority, without any further actions by plaintiffs to comply with\nOhio’s ballot access requirements, to order that defendant grant plaintiffs access to the November\nballot.  Plaintiffs have tendered 6,545 petition signatures, Complaint, Ex. B, as but one indication\nof the public support they enjoy.  In similar circumstances, courts have granted ballot access to\nnonmajor party candidates without requiring them to file any petition signatures whatsoever.  See,\ne.g., McCarthy v. Briscoe, 429 U.S. 1317 (1976);; McCarthy v. Askew, 540 F.2d 1254 (5th Cir.\n1976); McCarthy v. Slater, 553 P.2d 489 (Sup. Ct. Okla. 1976); Goldman-Frankie v. Austin, 727\nF.2d 603 (6th Cir. 1984); Hall v. Austin, 495 F. Supp. 782 (E.D. Mich. 1980).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons the Court is requested to enter a preliminary injunction granting\nthe plaintiffs access to the November 4, 2008 general election ballot and invalidating the ballot\naccess restrictions in Directive 2007-09 about which the plaintiffs complain.\nDated: July 10, 2008\nRespectfully submitted,\nGary Sinawski\n180 Montague Street 26th Floor\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\nTelephone: (516) 971-7783\nTelefax: (212) 581-1516\nE-mail: gsinawski@aol.com\n14\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 12 Filed: 07/10/08 Page: 15 of 15  PAGEID #: 129\ns/Mark Brown                          \nMark Brown, Trial Attorney\nOhio Registration No. 0081941\n303 East Broad Street\nColumbus, OH 43215\nTelephone: (614) 236-6590\nTelefax: (614) 236-6956\nE-mail: mbrown@law.capital.edu\nAttorneys for Plaintiffs\n15",

Plans Early-Primary Penalties  \nBy MARC SANTORA \nCorrection Appended \nThe Republican National Committee plans to penalize at least five states holding early \nprimaries, including New Hampshire and Florida, by refusing to seat at least half of their \ndelegates at the national convention in 2008, a party official said yesterday.  \nMuch of the focus in the primary scheduling fight up to now has been on the Democratic \nNational Committee’s moves to penalize Florida by not seating its convention delegates \nbecause of the state’s decision to move up its primary. But the Republican rules are just as \nstringent, and the national party said yesterday that it would not hesitate to enforce them.  \nThe action by Republicans and Democrats to move against states holding early contests is a \nrare instance of the two parties moving in concert, in this case to regain control over a rapidly \nevolving primary calendar that has thrust the nominating system into deep uncertainty just \nmonths before it is to begin. \n“The rules are clear,” said Tracey Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the Republican National \nCommittee. “Any state that holds their primary outside of the window shall be penalized \ndelegates.” States are not allowed to hold primaries before Feb. 5. \nIn addition to Florida and New Hampshire, Wyoming, Michigan and South Carolina also face \nsanctions for moving up their primaries. Two other early nominating states — Iowa and \nNevada — will escape Republican sanctions because they hold nonbinding caucuses, not \nprimaries. \nRepublican Party officials in Florida and Michigan said yesterday that they still thought it was \nunlikely they would face penalties — despite being told exactly the opposite by national party \nofficials — and were drawing up a plan to make their voices heard during the convention. \n“I am confident that all 114 delegates from Florida will be seated,” said Jim Greer, the \nchairman of the Florida Republican Party.  \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/us/politics/29calendar.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print... 6/30/2008\n\nG.O.P. Plans Early-Primary Penalties - New York Times Page 2of 3\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-3 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 2 of 3  PAGEID #: 80\nMr. Greer said Florida did not technically select its delegates on the date of the primary, but \nrather, the leaders in each of its 25 Congressional districts would choose delegates starting Feb. \n6, so it was not breaking the rules. The national party views the primary as binding delegates to \nvote in line with the voters and therefore does not accept that rationale. Party officials said they \nwere not negotiating with states.  \n“I am confident that the Republican National Committee or any eventual nominee will not \nallow the voices of Florida voters not to be heard,” Mr. Greer said. “Florida is too important a \nstate as it relates to electing to the next president.” \nBanning half a state’s delegation would be an extraordinary move. While state party officials \nhave played down the impact, noting that presidential candidates are often selected before the \nconvention, there is a chance that the parties could have brokered conventions in which each \ndelegate’s vote would be prized. \nMichigan officials are similarly arguing the state should not be penalized, saying the decision to \nset their primary on Jan. 15 rests with the State Legislature, which is likely to vote this week to \nfinalize its primary dates. \n“Why would you want to punish those key states when you are trying to win the general \nelection?” said Saul Anuzis, the chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. \nFergus Cullen, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said the party would \nhold to its primary — now set for early January — to maintain its historic role as the first \nprimary state, even if it had to accept penalties.  \n“If we end up being stripped of delegates, that is the price we are willing to pay,” Mr. Cullen \nsaid. \nThe Democratic National Committee carved out an exception for New Hampshire and South \nCarolina to vote early, so Democrats in those states will not be penalized. \nThe Republican National Committee set up strict rules in 2000 when it was already clear that \nstates were jockeying to move up primary dates. The rules were made in an effort to avoid the \nnominating process turning into a national primary, party officials said. Yet despite the rules, \nsome 20 states are likely to hold primaries on Feb. 5, creating a situation unlike any in modern \nhistory.  \n“If we don’t do something, this is going to become a national primary and there will be federal \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/us/politics/29calendar.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print... 6/30/2008\n\nG.O.P. Plans Early-Primary Penalties - New York Times Page 3of 3\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-3 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 3 of 3  PAGEID #: 81\nlegislation that takes it away from the parties,” said a top national Republican Party official \nwho spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations on the matter were continuing.  \nOne possible situation could allow the states to seat a full delegation even after they are \npenalized. If there is a clear nominee by the time of the convention, as has been the case since \n1976, the presumptive candidate could petition the national party to restore the delegates from \nthe penalized states. Such a move, however, could anger the states that held back from \nbumping up their primaries, and they could challenge such a move. \nIf the nomination is not settled by the time of the conventions, the issue of delegates could \nbecome crucial. If delegates are not seated, they cannot cast votes. But even if the nomination \nis largely settled, the battles over seating delegates and accommodating main figures from \nthese states at the convention could hamper the party’s unity going into the general election — \nsomething national and state officials said they were hoping to avoid.  \n“My expectation is that, in the end, all the delegates are going to be seated,” Mr. Anuzis said, \n“because the party is going to want to be united going into the general election.”  \nCorrection: August 31, 2007 \nAn article on Wednesday about plans by the Republican Party to penalize states for moving up \nthe dates of their primaries misstated the precedent for national political conventions that \nopened without a clear-cut nominee. It last occurred in 1976, not 50 years ago. (President \nGerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan arrived at the Republican convention that year without the \nnumber of votes needed for the nomination. Mr. Ford swayed enough delegates to win \nnarrowly on the first ballot.) \n \nCopyright 2007 The New York Times Company \nPrivacy Policy  Search  Corrections  RSS   First Look  Help  Contact Us  Work for Us  Site Map   \n  \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/us/politics/29calendar.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print... 6/30/2008",

The Two Cases Present Identical Legal Issues\n  A.  Libertarian Party v. Brunner  \n  On June 6, 2008, the Libertarian Party of Ohio and five other plaintiffs filed suit against \nthe Ohio Secretary of State to challenge the constitutionality of Secretary Brunner’s Directive \n2007-09.  Secretary Brunner issued Directive 2007-09 in light of (1) the Sixth Circuit’s decision \nin Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006), in which the Court of \nAppeals struck down Ohio’s minor party ballot access laws as unconstitutional and (2) the \nGeneral Assembly’s failure to cure the state law’s constitutional deficiency by enacting new laws \nto fill the resulting void.  The General Assembly passed no legislation in response to the Court’s \nruling, which left Ohio without statutory rules for regulating ballot access in the wake of the \ncircuit court’s decision. \n  In  attempting  to  administer  the  state’s  election  laws  in  this  unusual  and  untenable \nsituation,  Secretary  Brunner  utilized  her  authority  under  R.C.  3501.05  as  the  state’s  chief \nelections officer, to issue Directive 2007-09 to fill the void and provide some structure and \nconsistency with the lack of legislative guidance offered by the Ohio General Assembly.  Under \nthe now unconstitutional version of the law, R.C. 3517.01(A)(1), a minor party seeking to secure \na spot on the ballot had to file a petition no later than 120 days before the primary election, and \nthe petition had to contain signatures in an amount equal to one percent of the total vote cast in \nthe previous election.  When this statute was ruled unconstitutional by the circuit court, Secretary \nBrunner, by directive, increased the time for filing petitions, by moving the deadline up to 100 \ndays before the primary, and cut the required number of signatures required in half in an attempt \nto allow ballot access to minor parties in conformity with the court’s decision but to permit this \n  3\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 20 Filed: 07/25/08 Page: 4 of 7  PAGEID #: 162\nto occur in an orderly fashion without ballots being “clogged” with a myriad of political parties \nwhose qualifying indicia of requisite community support (to enable ballot access) are nonexistent \nfor a lack of appreciable qualifying standards. \n  On July 17, 2008, Judge Sargus struck down Directive 2007-09 and its application.  \nApplying the Sixth Circuit’s analysis in the first Libertarian Party case, Judge Sargus ruled that \nthe less burdensome ballot access rules contained in Directive 2007-09 continued to unduly \nburden First Amendment rights.1  Judge Sargus issued a preliminary injunction and ordered \nSecretary  Brunner  to  place  the  named  plaintiffs  on  the  November  2008  ballot  with  the \nLibertarian Party of Ohio designation. \n  B.  Moore v. Brunner\n  Plaintiff,  Brian  Moore,  presidential  candidate  of  the  Socialist  Party  USA,  filed  a \ncomplaint alleging that he intended to run as an independent candidate.  Mr. Moore and his co-\nplaintiffs  sought  a  declaration  that  the  restrictions  on  circulators  of  part-petitions  in  R.C. \n3503.06(A)  were  unconstitutional.2    On  June  2,  2008,  Judge  Frost  issued  a  preliminary \ninjunction barring the Secretary from applying R.C. 3503.06(A) to disqualify petitions circulated \nby unregistered voters and/or non-residents.  That decision still left Mr. Moore and his supporters \nwith the burden of collecting sufficient valid petition signatures. \n  However,  after  Judge  Sargus  issued  his  decision  in  Libertarian  Party,  the  Moore \nplaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint to add a challenge to Directive 2007-09.3  In the \nproposed  Second  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction,  Mr.  Moore  and  his  Vice-Presidential \n                                                 \n1   Alternatively, Judge Sargus ruled that under the United States Constitution, Articles I and II, the Secretary \ncould not create a structure for minor party ballot access, at least with regard to candidates for federal office, in the \nabsence of an express delegation of authority from the Ohio General Assembly to do so. \n2   R.C. §3503.06(A) requires that petition circulators be both Ohio residents and Ohio registered voters. \n3   Secretary Brunner does not oppose the motion for leave to amend, but notes, as a matter of case \nadministrative reference, that the motion has not at this juncture been granted. \n  4\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 20 Filed: 07/25/08 Page: 5 of 7  PAGEID #: 163\ncandidate, Stewart Alexander, seek automatic placement on the ballot, as well as identification \non the ballot as the Socialist Party candidates (abandoning their prior professed intention to run \nas independents).  Thus, although initially brought to establish a different legal principle, the \nMoore case now squarely raises an issue identical to that raised in Libertarian Party. \nII.  Consolidation Is Necessary To Ensure That Ballot Access Is Subject To Consistent \nRequirements \n \n  Even though Ohio currently has no ballot access statute and the Secretary of State’s \nDirective attempting to bridge that gap has also been nullified, it does not follow that Ohio must \nallow any and every name on the 2008 ballot.  The state has an interest in keeping ballots within \nmanageable, understandable limits because “laundry list” ballots discourage voter participation \nand confuse and frustrate those who do participate.  Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S. 709, 715 (1974). \n  Judge Sargus’ opinion notes that a minor party seeking ballot access must demonstrate \n“the requisite community support,” and concludes that the Libertarian Party met its burden.  \nHowever, the opinion provides no guidelines to help determine what the “requisite” amount of \n“community support” might be, or how to measure or quantify that support.  To the contrary, \nJudge  Sargus  specifically  stated  that  “the  Court  will  not  prescribe  Constitutional  election \nprocedures for the state.”  [Opinion, p. 14]. \n  Given the unfortunate state of Ohio’s minor party ballot access laws, the best way to \nensure some measure of consistency in ballot access is to have a single judge decide the claims \nof minor parties alleging “the requisite community support” to be on the ballot. \nIII.  Consolidation Is Justified By The Short Amount Of Time Remaining Before The \nElection  \n \n  The 2008 election is rapidly approaching, and the Secretary of State faces deadlines in \nthe very near future that must be met to ensure an orderly election process.  Specifically, the \n  5\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 20 Filed: 07/25/08 Page: 6 of 7  PAGEID #: 164\ndeadline for candidates to submit nominating petitions is August 21, 2008, and affected county \nboards of elections must certify the petition signatures within seven days thereafter.  R.C. \n3513.251; R.C. 3513.263.  Under R.C. §3501.01, the Secretary must certify the form of the \nofficial ballots no later than September 5, 2008.  And by September 30, 2008, the absentee \nballots must be ready for distribution.  R.C. 3509.01. \n  Given these impending deadlines, there is insufficient time to seek appellate review of \nenough cases to establish a workable framework.  Given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, it \nis  likely  that  different  judges  may  apply  different  frameworks  and  arrive  at  inconsistent \nconclusions.  Meanwhile, the lack of objective criteria creates uncertainty for candidates, leaving \nthe Secretary in a position once again to make decisions with no clear guidance from statute or \ncase precedent and will almost certainly result in extra litigation. \n  While there is no question that it was the General Assembly’s responsibility, in the first \ninstance, to provide a new statutory framework for minor party access to Ohio elections, the \nplain fact is that the legislature has not done so, and there is an election looming.  By making this \nrequest, the Secretary is not asking Judge Sargus or any other judge of this Honorable Court to \ncreate election procedures.  That responsibility belongs to the General Assembly and to the \nSecretary of State.  Rather, recognizing that these cases do exist and must be decided, the \nSecretary believes that consolidation would ensure consistent outcomes, which would serve the \ninterest of Ohio voters in a fair process and promote confidence in the electoral system. \n  6\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 20 Filed: 07/25/08 Page: 7 of 7  PAGEID #: 165\nIV.

The total turnout of 10.8 \npercent of eligibles was lower than GOP turnout in 2000 (10.9), 1980 (11.4) and 1976 (11.5). \nEarlier GOP presidential primaries—1964 (10.9), 1956 (11.9) and 1952 (19.9)—also had higher \nturnout, but with fewer GOP primaries being held. \n(cid:120) So far 54,753,664 have voted in this year’s presidential primaries, with Democratic candidates \ngarnering 35,006,878 votes (64 percent of the total vote) and the GOP 19,632,587 votes (36 \npercent). Candidates in primaries for other parties received 114,199 votes. \n(cid:120) With the exception of Nebraska’s primary, which was held even though all the delegates were \nallocated in caucuses, every state reported higher primary turnout than in 2004. \nAccording to Curtis Gans, director of CSAE, turnout is likely to be high in the 2008 general election, \nbut not because primary turnout was high.\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 2 of 28  PAGEID #: 83\n“High primary turnout does not necessarily augur high general election turnout,” Gans writes. “In \n1972, the year of the highest presidential primary turnout, turnout in the general election experienced \nthe largest decline (5.3 percentage points) of any election since World War II when turnout declined \n6.8 percentage points between 1940 and 1944, largely because a large percentage of Americans were \noutside the country fighting that war. (See chart 2 in Summary Charts section and commentary \nno. 1 below.) \n“Rather it is very likely that this fall’s election will have high turnout because of the issues which will be \nin play and the economic condition of the nation,” Gans added. “But whether it will equal or exceed \nthe 2004 general election turnout when President Bush served as a lightning rod and propelled 60.9 \npercent of the eligible electorate to the polls (the highest turnout since 61.9 percent voted in 1968) is \nup in the air at this time.”  \nOther findings in the report include: \n(cid:120) Of the states that held presidential primaries in both parties and recorded record high turnouts, \nthe highest were New Hampshire, where 51.9 percent of the electorate voted; followed by \nOhio (40.3); Vermont (39.4); Massachusetts (38.2) and Indiana (36.8). The next two states in \norder of turnout were California (36.3) and Wisconsin (36.3), neither of which produced record \nturnouts. These last two were primary reasons why national turnout was not a record in 2008. \n(cid:120) At the top of Democratic record presidential primary turnout were the District of Columbia, \nwhere 33.4 percent voted, followed by Vermont (31.3), New Hampshire (28.5), Indiana (27.8), \nOhio (27.5) and Massachusetts (27.3) \n(cid:120) Of the states where Republican voting recorded high presidential primary turnout, Alabama led \nthe way with 16.3 percent of the eligible electorate turning out, followed by Florida (15.9), \nGeorgia (15.3), Oklahoma (13.1) and Tennessee (12.3). The highest GOP turnout (not a \nrecord) was recorded in New Hampshire, where 23.3 percent of the eligible electorate voted. \nBelow are the complete findings of the report: \nMore charts giving the current rankings on the basis of turnout and the full presidential \nprimary turnout history 1948-2008 will be available at \nhttp://www.american.edu/media/electionexperts, which will be updated with final official \nresults and the late primaries. \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 3 of 28  PAGEID #: 84\nSUMMARY CHARTS \nRelationship Between Primary Turnout and General \nElection Turnout: 1968-2008\n60\ne 50\ng\na\nnt\ne\nerc 40 Primary\nP General\nut \no 30\nn\nur\nT\n20\n10\n1968 1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008\nYear\n1.

They reflect the views, hopefully educated by \nfact and experience, of Curtis Gans, CSAE’s director. \n1. The Disconnect Between Primary and General Election Turnout: Turnout in this year’s \nprimaries was nearly a record high, and turnout in this year’s general election is likely to be high also. \nBut that is not because 2008 primary turnout was high (except in one respect). In 2004, national \nprimary turnout was the lowest since 1968 while 2004 general election turnout was the highest since \n1968. The modern day (in the era of many primaries) record for primary turnout was set in 1972 and \nthat year’s general election turnout recorded the sharpest decline from the previous election since \nWorld War II drive turnout down by a larger amount in 1944.  \nThe principal reason for the disconnect is that primaries and general elections are separate political \nevents. Primaries are, mainly, for the active and interested of each major political party, with the \noccasional engagement, as in this year, of independent voters where their participation is possible, \nstates without partisan registration and states with open (all citizens regardless of party affiliation can \nvote) or modified open (independents can vote in party primaries but not registrants of the opposition \nparty). Usually primaries draw less than half the percentage of voters who turn out for the general \nelection. But in certain primary seasons, primaries not only help determine the nominee but also the \nfuture direction of the party. In 1972, because of the deep divisions within the Democratic Party over \nthe war in Vietnam, turnout in the Democratic primaries reached a record high. But after the chaotic \nDemocratic National Convention of that year, the major misstep by the Democratic nominee in failing \nto fully vet his vice-presidential choice leading to the replacement of the initial designee, the \ndisaffection of major elements of the party from the nominee and the very one-sided general election \nturnout plunged in the general election. In 2004, thanks in part to the misguided efforts of Democratic \nNational Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe in seeking to end the nominating process as quickly as \npossible, the nomination contest was effectively over after the New Hampshire primary and, in a \nprevalent ethos lacking the religion of civic duty, turnout plunged in all subsequent contests. But the \ndeeply polarizing nature of the Bush presidency and deep divisions over the United States’ military \nengagement in Iraq drew citizens to the polls in percentages not seen since the 1960s. \nThis year there was near-record turnout in the primaries and there will likely be high turnout in the \ngeneral election, but as a separate electoral event. Primary turnout was high, in part, because neither \nparty had an incumbent national office-holder and presumptive nominee running. It was especially \nhigh in the Democratic Party because of the uniqueness of the eventual front-runners—the potential \nfirst woman and the potential first African-American nominee. That uniqueness was augmented, if exit \npolls are to be believed, by the largest youth primary participation since 1968 (for Sen. Eugene \nMcCarthy and, to a lesser extent later for Sen. Robert Kennedy, including many who could not vote at \na time when the voting age was 21years old), by a much higher than usual African-American \nparticipation, by a larger than usual primary engagement of independent registrants and by a higher \ninvolvement of women. \nTurnout in this year’s general election will be driven by an extraordinarily discontented public. \nAccording to polls, more than 80 percent think the political direction of the country is on the wrong \ntrack, more than 70 percent of the nation disapproves of the performance of President Bush, more \nthan two-thirds now oppose American involvement in Iraq and more than 80 percent believe the \nnation has slipped into recession. Add to that foreclosures, ever higher gas and commodity prices, a \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 9 of 28  PAGEID #: 90\ngeneral feeling of insecurity and a public which, by recent standards, is paying much greater attention \nto this electoral season and you have a recipe for very high levels of fall voting. Since 1960, turnout \nsignificantly increased in only three general elections—the mid-term election of 1982 and the 1992 and \n2004 presidential elections. The turnout increases in both 1982 and 1992 were largely driven by citizen \ninsecurity about economies perceived to be in recession and, as noted above, the 2004 turnout surge \nwas propelled by the polarizing policy and presidency of President Bush.  In this election both the \neconomy and the policies of the Bush administration are in play. In addition, because Sen. Obama is \nthe virtually certain Democratic nominee, he brings into the process two elements which would vote in \nsubstantially lesser numbers had he not been the nominee—college-educated young citizens and \nAfrican-Americans. \nBecause of these factors there is no question that turnout will be high. Whether it will be higher than \nthe 61 percent of eligibles who voted in 2004 is still in doubt. There could be a fall-off in the most \nconservative of evangelicals, not seeing Sen. McCain as having an authentic empathy for their \nconcerns. There may be Republicans, like the followers of Rep. Ron Paul but not limited to that group, \nwho abhor the war in Iraq but can’t bring themselves to vote for a Democrat and some in the \ndemographic du jour, the white working class, who can't bring themselves to vote for either Sen. \nObama or a Republican. But it is equally likely that there will be a tidal wave of citizen discontent \noverwhelming many ill-prepared voting places. \n2. Who Benefits from High Turnout?  Despite the belief by some in the Republican Party that the \nbest thing that could happen to them is rain on Election Day—that low turnout benefits them and \nhigh turnout benefits the Democrats (a myth that tends to lead to GOP efforts to minimize turnout), \nthere is no recent evidence to support that belief. In 2004, the highest turnout election since 1968, \nPresident Bush won. In 1968, Richard Nixon won. Two of the three lowest turnout elections since the \n1920s produced victories for Harry S. Truman (1948) and Bill Clinton (1996). \nThat said, there is no question that every increment in turnout in 2008 will benefit the Democrats. In \neach election in recent times in which economic discontent has been a major factor as in 1982 and \n1992, voters have taken out that discontent on the party in power in the White House. In every \nelection in which an extended and unpopular war tried public support and patience, as in 1966, 1968 \nand 1952, the party in power in the White House suffered. Every year that a president’s popularity sank \nbelow 35 percent, as in 1952, 1980 and 1992, the nation voted to oust the party in power. All of these \nfactors exist in 2008—to which may be added high oil and commodity prices and a profound public \nsense that the nation is on the wrong track. And on the two most important issues of the day—the \neconomy and the war in Iraq—the Republican nominee promises a continuation of the basic policies \nof the Bush administration. \nAll of this should make for major Democratic gains in both houses of Congress, the nation’s \ngovernorships, the state legislatures of most states and makes Obama a distinct favorite to be the \nnation’s next president. He will have some hurdles to climb. He has no executive experience, but then \nneither does his opponent. His foreign policy credentials are skimpy, but the debate will be between \nlack of experience and a continuation of the current policies. He has developed a problem of \nconnecting with and getting the support of the white working class, a problem he did not have in \nConnecticut, Maryland, Missouri and Wisconsin—or before he made his unfortunate and ill-thought-\nout remarks about working class bitterness and Sen. Clinton seized on them to create a class and race \nwedge issue. Both he and she will need to work hard to rebuild his connections to that segment of the \npopulation. The state of the economy should help them bring what became the Reagan Democrats \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 10 of 28  PAGEID #: 91\n(those who bolted because of cultural issues) back into the Democratic fold. And then there is the \nquestion of race, a problem that clearly exists but is not quantifiable. When Clinton received more than \n70 percent of the white vote in Mississippi, it showed clearly that while the deep South may be \namenable to a conservative Democratic congressional candidate, it is not likely to support an African-\nAmerican liberal presidential candidate. Clinton’s vote did not include what is now the majority and \nlily-white Southern Republican Party. Race has also reared its divisive head in Massachusetts, North \nCarolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia, and it is the one aspect of Obama’s \nchallenge which will be present everywhere that he won’t be able to fully overcome. Some people will \nnot vote for him simply because he is an African-American. But the nation wants a major change in \ndirection; it wants someone who will at least attempt to end the persistent political polarization and get \npeople of disparate views to work together. That has been the premise of his campaign, something he \nwill need to define more fully in the light not of the half of the electorate which votes in primaries but \nthe whole of the electorate which begins to give politics its full attention after Labor Day. The issue of \nrace will not go away but its presence and its impact will be a test of what kind of nation we are and \nhave become. \n3. The Press: When the post mortems on the 2008 campaign are written, the press will not get high \nmarks. The Project for Excellence in Journalism will certainly cover the press’s foibles in great and \naccurate detail—particularly the degree to which it focused on the horse race and tactics to the \nexclusion of substance as a major concern, depriving the voting public of some preview of what \ncandidates will do in office. This is not an attempt to compete with the Project’s good work, but rather \nto highlight two issues of import that relate to CSAE’s primary concern with respect to the motivation \nto vote. The first of these concerns is the degree to which the press chewed the bones of candidates’ \nproblems long beyond any public nourishment. There are, in this context, things the mainstream press \nshould never have taken seriously—such as Obama sitting on a board with a reformed and middle-\nclass person who participated in radical activities 40 years ago. It was, on the other hand, reasonable to \nshow Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s original remarks and Obama’s response to it; Rev. Wright’s opportunistic \nseizing of the spotlight and Obama’s full separation from his former pastor; Clinton’s claim of heroism \nin Bosnia and the film that put a lie to her claims; and Obama’s “bitter” remarks and Clinton’s use of \nthem as a wedge issue. The problem lay not in the reportage of each of these events, but in keeping the \nspotlight on these issues via polling, continuous commentary and reportage often limited solely to \nthese events, exaggerating their import almost to the exclusion of anything else. This helps feed citizen \npublic cynicism about their political leaders, when, in truth, each of the potential candidates have many \nstrengths to commend them.  \nThe second concern is the press’s 2007 role in narrowing the Democratic candidate field to the two \npresently surviving candidates before a single vote had been cast. Clinton and Obama each received six \ntimes the coverage of John Edwards, a ratio which would have been even worse had not the recurrence \nof Elizabeth Edwards’s cancer been revealed. Clinton and Obama each received eight times the \ncoverage of Sen. Biden with even lesser coverage for Sen. Dodd and Gov. Richardson. This, in turn, \nmade it virtually impossible for Biden, Dodd and Richardson to compete and forced Edwards to \nvirtually live in Iowa in the hope that a victory there might provide him the coverage and support the \npress had denied him. We will never know whether any of the candidates other than Clinton and \nObama would have made better nominees or better presidents or might have been able to gain the \nsupport to make them competitive. We will never know because the press didn’t allow us to know and \nthat is an abuse of any canon of good journalism. \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 11 of 28  PAGEID #: 92\n4. The Nominating Process: Part of the reason the press was allowed to abuse its power was the \ncurrent nominating process—the long ersatz campaign, lasting a year or more before a single vote \nwould be cast. Much of the criticism of the nominating process has been focused on two issues—\nfrontloading, the move toward an ever-earlier start to the primary process; and the unrepresentative \nnature of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and their undue influence on the \nnominating outcome. It is true that a nominating process which begins in January creates too long a \nprimary season and largely makes it impossible for states to hold their primaries for other offices on \nthe same day, substantially increasing election administration expense and forcing citizens to go to the \npolls three times in an election year. It is not true that Iowa and New Hampshire exert undue influence \non who emerges as the eventual nominee or that combined with other subsequent contests which \nprovide more diverse populations, they are so unrepresentative. As David Broder, Washington Post\ncolumnist, has noted, both of these states are among those which are in contention in the general \nelection campaign. In a larger sense, the history of Iowa and New Hampshire have not shown them to \nbe determinative. Sen. Eugene McCarthy lost the New Hampshire primary but less than a month later \ndrove President Lyndon Johnson from the race. Sen. Edmund Muskie won the New Hampshire \nprimary only to be out of the race six weeks later. President Carter did focus on Iowa (and Florida) but \nvirtually ignored New Hampshire. President Clinton lost the New Hampshire primary but won the \npresidency. Sen. John McCain was an upset winner of the New Hampshire primary in 2000, only to be \nrelegated to also-ran status two weeks later. When Iowa and New Hampshire are followed by \nindividual primaries and caucuses of different demographic profiles, they can and often have become \none-week events.  \nThe larger problem with the nominating process is the grouping of the primaries early in the primary \nseason and the desire of large states to move their primaries forward to be part of the grouping. When \n23 states, including some of the largest states hold primaries and caucuses on one day, as was the case \nFebruary 5 of this year, it is imperative for candidates to raise large sums of money in advance to \ncompete (conservatively estimated this year at $50 million). When the maximum an individual can \ncontribute is $2,300, it means that candidates must announce a year in advance in order to raise the $1 \nmillion a week needed to be potentially competitive. This needed ante to get in the game means that \nqualified candidates may not be able to compete and creates a money criterion for viability. It also, as \nnoted, gives the press enormous power. \nThe one good aspect of this year’s nominating process was that it provided a long enough track that at \nleast the two Democratic candidates got thorough scrutiny. But because of the early grouping, there \nwere far fewer states left in play to render final judgment. And those states which moved up their \nprimaries to February 5 so that they could be part of the decision-making found that February 5 passed \nand their role was not at all decisive. It is reminiscent of how all this grouping got started. After the \n1984 election, Southern Democratic state party chairs decided that one of the reasons that Sen. Walter \nMondale lost was that he was too liberal and they decided to join together to create the first early Super \nTuesday primary composed largely of Southern states. What they forgot was that while the South as a \nregion was more conservative than the rest of the nation, the Southern Democratic Party with a \nsubstantial percentage of African-Americans in its membership was not more conservative than the \nrest of the nation. The result then was that the Rev. Jesse Jackson won five states, the “Northern” \ncandidate, Gov. Michael Dukakis, won five states and the so-called Southern candidate, then Sen. Al \nGore, won five states. But instead of saying, “Boy, was that a dumb idea,” the Southerners kept their \nregional primary and other states began to move their dates forward leading to the present system. \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 12 of 28  PAGEID #: 93\nIt is time to finally say, “Boy, was that a bad idea.” The way to eliminate the heavy early pursuit of \ndollars, the ersatz campaign and the press’s untoward power is to start the process beginning with \nindividual and diverse small state primaries which would permit candidates to establish their political \nsupport without having to raise enormous sums in advance. It would permit the results of the early \ncontests to provide guidance on which candidates are deserving of both political and financial support \nand it would winnow out the field so that the larger states could then decide which of the winnowed in \ncandidates should be nominated. It would ensure that candidates would be vetted over a sufficient \nperiod of time based on their qualities of leadership and their programs rather than their ability to raise \nearly money. \nA proposal which embodied these principles came within one day of being ratified by the Republican \nNational Convention in 2000, only to be shot down by President Bush. A modified version of that \nproposal, called the Ohio plan, has been passed by the Republican rules committee and has drawn \ninterest from the Democratic committeeon rules and by-laws. That plan would have the same four \nstates which initiated the process in 2008 begin the process again in 2012, followed by 15 smaller states \nencouraged to hold individual primaries. Then, in one manner or another, the larger states could weigh \nin.  Some Republican leaders from larger states are resisting this effort, but perhaps they should have \nlearned the lesson from this year’s nominating process—that coming early does not ensure influence \nand does ensure many of the same problems that have plagued the nominating system since 1988. \n5. There Is No Millennial Generation: The large-scale involvement of college resident and educated \nyouth is one of the most heartening aspects of this year’s nominating process. But the conclusions \nsome have drawn from that participation—that we have a new politically engaged generation—is \nsimply not supported by the facts.  \nThose involved this year are a fraction of the youth population and were brought in by the uniqueness \nof Obama’s candidacy—precisely because he seemed to offer something different than the politics they \nhad been eschewing. They would not have stayed in—at least in anywhere near the numbers which \nhave participated in the primaries—had Obama not won the nomination. They won’t stay in if he’s not \nelected and their interest and engagement won’t be sustained if he does not live up to the promise of \nhis candidacy once in office. \nThe involvement of middle-class educated youth this year is not an isolated phenomenon. There is a \nreservoir of idealism, hope and a willingness to engage that has been part of every generation. In my \nlifetime, some of this group were madly for Adlai, others were engaged by the youth and energy of \nJohn F. Kennedy, still others formed the foot soldiers of the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war \nmovements and came clean for Gene (McCarthy) in New Hampshire’s primary campaign. They also \nwere, for about eight months, enticed by the policy wonkishness on issues they cared about of Bill \nClinton and Al Gore, were taken for about a month or two by the 2000 candidacy of John McCain and \nthe 2004 candidacy of Howard Dean and came out in force in the battleground states against President \nBush through the proxy of working for Sen. John Kerry. \nThe difference between the idealistic activism of the 1950s and 1960s and the activism of the 1980s \nand later is that the earlier generations were politically involved and interested and stayed in political \nactivity even when their causes did not meet with success or their leaders showed feet of clay. They did \nso because there was a totally different ethos in America then. Schools were dominated by the ideas of \nJohn Dewey who made educated citizens a major educational aim. Parents discussed politics in the \nhome. The media was more concentrated and more purposive. There was much less cynicism. The \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 13 of 28  PAGEID #: 94\ninstitutions underlying democracy were strong and well-aligned. People could and did work together \nacross partisan and ideological lines. Great things were accomplished, people felt good about politics \nand government and wanted to be a part of that enterprise and believed their participation mattered. \nThose who were briefly active in the 1980s and later did not stay involved. They didn’t because there is \nand has been for some time a totally different ethos. Participation in institutions has declined sharply. \nMedia are fragmented and cynical. Politics tends to be a bad word, with most of the young having a \ndim view of the enterprise. Government is hamstrung by ideological polarization fed by political \nparties that are misaligned. Schools no longer train for citizenship (although some promote service \nwhich is not the same thing and does not have a carry-over effect to politics). Community has been \neroded. Negativity in large volume dominates the conduct of politics. Civility is all too often absent. \nThere is simply no grounding for a new engaged generation to emerge.  \nAnyone who has been taken by the idea of a “Millennial Generation” should read the work of William \nDamon, whose most recent book, “The Path to Purpose,” gives a research-based and much more \naccurate account of today’s youth. It is possible that should Obama ascend to the presidency, he may \nby his eloquence, actions, policies and approach create the seeds for reversal of the decay of a \nsustained, politically involved youth. But that is a great deal to ask of one man in very difficult times. \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 14 of 28  PAGEID #: 95\nNOTES\n1. What is Turnout? Turnout should be a simple calculation in which the numerator is the number of \nvotes cast and the denominator is the number of citizens eligible to vote. However, various anomalies \nin election statistics, some of which are outlined in detail below, make this calculation more \ncomplicated. By common usage, the numerator in every presidential election year is the vote for \npresident (even though that tally is usually about one percentage point lower than the actual number of \ncitizens who go to the polls). It is lower because many states, although an ever-diminishing number, do \nnot keep records of all those who go to the polls, the total ballots cast. In mid-term elections, the \nnumerator is the total of votes for the statewide race in each state which draws the highest number of \nvotes and the aggregate total of votes for U.S. House of Representatives in those states which do not \nhave statewide races. (This total tends to be between 1 and 1.5 percentage points lower than the actual \ntotal ballots cast but is used for the same reasons—that many states do not compile total ballots cast \nfigures.)\nTurnout is NOT the percentage of those registered who voted. There are three basic reasons for this: \na. Using registration as a denominator does not account for the whole of the electorate, including those \nwho are not registered. Thus, it gives a false picture of true citizen engagement. b. Changes in \nregistration law can dramatically affect the figures. If the nation adopts, as it did, a registration law that \nprovides for national mail registration, registration at motor vehicle bureaus and at social service \nagencies, registration will go up but turnout of those registered will decline artificially by a greater \namount than it does when using the entire eligible electorate as a denominator. c. Registration figures \nare subject to the fluctuations of election administration. If a state conducts a thorough purge of its \nregistration lists close to election, its registration figures will be lower and thus its percentage of \nregistered voting will be higher. But if registration lists are not so purged, as they are not in many \nstates, the figures for registration will be higher and the turnout based on these inflated registration \nfigures will be lower. Consider how distorted a turnout percentage using registration as a base would be \nin a state such as Alaska, which because of lack of regular list cleaning and potential flaws with the \nCensus Bureau’s estimates of the state’s eligible population, reports registration figures which are \nregularly in excess of 100 percent of the eligible citizen population. \n2. The Eligible Vote—The Denominator for Determining Turnout: The eligible vote in this \nreport is the number of people residing in the United States who are 18 years of age or over minus the \nnumber of non-citizens residing in the United States who are 18 years of age and over as of November \n1. It is an interpolated figure from the 2000 Census, based on the methodology outlined below. \nFor years, CSAE and every other reputable organization working in this field had used the Census \nBureau’s estimates of November age-eligible population (VAP) to determine turnout. That figure came \nunder legitimate criticism because it included non-citizens; convicted felons (in most states) and, in \nsome states, ex-felons; and people deemed mentally incompetent in institutions who could not vote \nand did not include citizens residing in other countries, citizens naturalized during the election year and \nthe citizen portion of the Census’s undercount, all of whom could vote but were not part of the VAP \nestimate. The Census Bureau has ceased providing its VAP estimates. \nFor years also, professor Walter Dean Burnham, professor emeritus at the University of Texas at \nAustin, has been producing a denominator of age-eligible citizens (age-eligible population minus age-\neligible non-citizens, interpolated by state and nation from and between decennial Censuses). After \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 15 of 28  PAGEID #: 96\nsome study of this matter, CSAE has come to believe that this denominator is the best for determining \nturnout, subject to the caveat below. It has come to this belief because of two factors:  \n1. Available data. One does not determine turnout simply for any given year but also as an historical \ncomparison with previous years. Data for several of the issues involving the inadequacy of the age-\neligible population (VAP) figures are simply not available, not available in a timely manner, not \navailable over a given period of history, or not allocated to the states. Data on convicted and \nincarcerated felons are only available for a fairly recent time period. State laws on whether convicted \nfelons and ex-felons can vote are changing and have changed over time. There is no accurate set of \nfigures on those deemed mentally incompetent. The number of American citizens residing abroad is \nascertainable in a ballpark fashion (since the Census bureau will not enumerate them), but the number \nof age-eligible has to be estimated and there are no figures which provide allocation of these citizens by \nstate. Naturalization figures come in too late, often a year or two after the election year, to be usable in \nany current population accounting. And while any given Census undercount can be allocated by state, \none can only estimate how much of that undercount is of citizens as opposed to non-citizens and \nestimates of undercounts only began in 1940. \n2. The balance of the figures: In studying this statistical problem, CSAE has found that the most \nimportant issue is that of non-citizens. If one wants to have a relatively accurate picture of turnout, one \nmust eliminate the non-citizens from the age-eligible population. On the other hand, the other \nadjustments to the denominator would not substantially differ from the denominator of citizen age-\neligible population. In pursuing its inquiry into this topic, CSAE found that the factors which would \nlower the denominator—felons, ex-felons and people deemed mentally incompetent who can’t vote—\nare roughly equal to two of the factors which would increase the denominator—citizens living in other \ncountries and naturalization—who could vote. If one added a ballpark figure for the number of \ncitizens in the undercount who could vote, to the other factors which would increase the \ndenominator—the three factors (citizens living in other countries, naturalization and the undercount) \nwould substantially exceed the factors other than non-citizens (felons and ex-felons and \ninstitutionalized citizens deemed incompetent).  \nThe one caveat in adopting the Burnham methodology lock, stock and barrel is that Burnham \ninterpolates from census to census. These censuses are accurate as of April 1 of each decennial year for \nall of the past 50 years. (In prior years, census results captured the population as of varying months.) In \norder to have more accurate figures for November, CSAE has, using the same methodology, projected \ncitizen population to November. CSAE is using the April figure for this report. \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8-4 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 16 of 28  PAGEID #: 97\nMethodology\nSince the decennial census population figures are accurate as of April 1 in each census year, the VAP \nBurnham dataset calculates the difference in the required census figures between a base census year \nand the same figures as reported in the following census.  To estimate the voting age population for \nthe years between the censuses, the difference between them is simply multiplied by the number of \nmonths that have passed beyond April 1 of the base year and then added to the base year figure.  For \nexample, to arrive at the April 1, 1992, voting age population, the difference between the April 1, 1990, \ncensus population and the April 1, 2000, census population is multiplied by 24/120ths (for the 24 out \nof 120 months between the census counts) and added to the April 1, 1990 figure. \nThe process for arriving at the CSAE November-eligible figures is the same, except that the data is \nprojected forward to November instead of April.  To accomplish this, the multiplier is simply changed \nto the number of months that have passed since April of the base census year.  For instance, to \ncalculate the November 1996 voting age population, the difference between April 1, 1990, and April 1, \n2000, is multiplied by 79/120ths and added to the April 1, 1990, count.  The same interpolation \nprocess is applied to the decennial census counts of non-citizens of voting age in each state.  Once \nestimates of the total voting age population and the non-citizen voting age population for each state \nhave been calculated, the non-citizen figure is simply subtracted from the total to arrive at the \nappropriate figure. \nSince the last decennial census occurred in 2000, it is necessary to project the figures forward to arrive \nat the voting age population for 2002 and 2004.  To accomplish this, the difference between the 1990 \nand 2000 decennial censuses is used to establish a rate of growth.  This rate of growth is then used to \nproject forward based on the number of months passed since April 1990 out of the 120 months \nbetween the censuses.  For instance, to obtain the voting age population for April 2004, the difference \nbetween April 1, 1990, and April 1, 2000, is multiplied by 168/120 and added to the April 1, 1990 total. \n3. The Votes: 2008 vote totals are final and official and certified by the chief election officer in each \nstate—except for Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia which are final and \nunofficial. Vote totals for previous years are final and official, certified by the chief election officer in \neach state, and verified by comparison with other compilations where available. CSAE will be adding \nthe votes in later primaries, as well as the official results in the four states which are, in this report, \nunofficial, in an amended report which will be published on the American University and the center’s \nWeb site after all primaries are concluded. This report does not include turnout for caucuses because \nCSAE believes there are no valid comparables for caucus turnout. Note also that the vote averages for \nprior years in the large statistical charts in the back are based only on the primaries held so far. The \nsummary charts below include all primaries for previous years. \n4.

Introduction \n \n  When dealing with issues of ballot access, it is important for the State to balance the \nappropriate desire of new political parties to come into existence against the need to maintain \norder on the ballot.  Just as we cannot have a meaningful democracy if new ideas and new \npolitical parties are barred, so too we cannot have a meaningful democracy if a ballot becomes so \nunruly by simply allowing any party desiring to field candidates to do so.   \n  Secretary of State Brunner recognized these competing interests when she issued \nDirective 2007-09 in response to the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Libertarian Party v. Blackwell.  \nAfter the Sixth Circuit struck down Ohio’s previous requirement that a new political party file its \npetitions within 120 days of an election and the Ohio General Assembly failed to pass any new \nlaws to regulate the situation, Secretary Brunner exercised her authority under Ohio law.  She \nshorted the period of time before the primary when a new political party needed to submit its \npetitions and cut the signature requirement by 50%.  Thus, Directive 2007-09 constitutionally \n \n  1\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 2 of 16  PAGEID #: 56\n \nrequires any new political party to show that it enjoys a modicum of support in Ohio prior to \ngaining access to the ballot.   \nII.  Argument \nA.  Ohio’s Ballot Access Requirements \n \n  Under Ohio law, neither ballot access nor recognition as a political party is permanent.  \nRather, a political party is “any group of voters that, at the most recent regular state election, \npolled for its candidate for governor in the state or nominees for presidential electors at least five \nper cent of the entire vote cast for that office.”  RC 3517.01(A)(1).  In addition, Ohio law had \npreviously provided that a political party can come into existence if it filed a petition signed by \n“qualified electors in number to at least one per cent of the total vote for governor or nominees \nfor presidential electors at the most recent election” within 120 days of a primary election.  Id.  \nAfter a political party achieves ballot access, it will retain ballot access so long as its \ngubernatorial candidate or its presidential electors receive at least 5% of the vote in a four year \nelection cycle.  If any currently recognized political party fails to garner the minimum threshold \nof 5% of the vote or if a new political party desires to come into existence in Ohio, it must file \nthe same petition with the Secretary within the timeframe established.   \n  In Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006), the Court of \nAppeals held that Ohio’s combined requirement that new political parties file their petition \nwithin 120 days of the primary election and nominate their candidates by primary are \nunconstitutional.  After the Ohio General Assembly failed to act in order to provide a mechanism \nfor new political parties to achieve ballot access in Ohio, Secretary of State Brunner issued \nDirective 2007-09.  The Secretary, pursuant to her authority as the State’s chief elections official, \ndetermined to grant ballot recognition to any new political party if it filed valid signatures from \n  2\n \n \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 3 of 16  PAGEID #: 57\n \nqualified electors equal to 0.5% of the total vote cast for governor in 2006 within 100 days of the \nprimary election.  Similarly, a presidential candidate who is the nominee of a party which is not \nlegally recognized in Ohio likewise can file petitions in the same amount within 80 days of the \ngeneral election.  Such a filing will entitle the candidate to have a party identifier next to his \nname on the presidential ballot.1\nB.  The Sixth Circuit’s Decision in Libertarian Party v. Blackwell.    \n \nThe Sixth Circuit had previously ruled that Ohio’s previous ballot access law was \nunconstitutional as it relates to new parties in presidential election years.  Libertarian Party, 462 \nF.3d at 595.  The Court found that Ohio’s combination of having a filing date 120 days prior to \nthe March primary and requiring new political parties to nominate their candidates via primary in \nMarch was unconstitutional.  “Our inquiry is not whether each law individually creates an \nimpermissible burden but rather whether the combined effect of the applicable election \nregulations creates an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment rights.”  Id. at 586. The \nCourt determined that early deadlines require minor parties to recruit supporters at a time when \nthe population was not politically energized, requiring 30,000 people to sign a petition more than \na year in advance of a general election, and limiting the ability of new political parties to respond \nto issues that might arise later in the campaign combine to make Ohio’s previous 120 day filing \nrequirement unconstitutional.  Id. at 586-87.   \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  Based upon this alternative, it appears that the claims of the Libertarian Party’s joint presidential candidate are not \nyet ripe since he can submit 20,114 signatures by August 18, 2008. \n \n  3\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 4 of 16  PAGEID #: 58\n \nC.  Directive 2007-09 constitutionally regulates party ballot access in Ohio.   \nThe legal test for ballot access regulations is well known.  States “may, and inevitably \nmust, enact reasonable regulations of parties, elections, and ballots to reduce election- and \ncampaign-related disorder.”  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997).  \nEvery election law or regulation imposes some burden upon the voter.  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 \nU.S. 428, 433 (1992).  This is true if the regulation at issue concerns registration, the \nqualifications of electors, the selection of candidates, or the voting process itself.  Id. citing \nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983).  Subjecting every election regulation to strict \nscrutiny, “would tie the hands of the States seeking to assure that elections are operated equitably \nand efficiently.”  Id.  Therefore, a State election regulation that creates some barriers to the \nelection process does not automatically trigger a strict scrutiny approach.  Id. at 433-34 citing \nBullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 143 (1972).  Instead, the Supreme Court has found that a \nflexible standard must apply in cases challenging State election laws.  The court  \nmust weight ‘the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to \nvindicate’ against ‘the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications \nfor the burden imposed by its rule,’ taking into consideration ‘the extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.’ \n \nId. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789).   \nBased upon this standard, if a State law or regulation “imposes only ‘reasonable, \nnondiscriminatory restrictions’ upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of voters, ‘the \nState’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify’ the restrictions.”  Id. \nquoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788.  Furthermore, any party seeking to challenge a State’s \nreasonable and nondiscriminatory regulatory interest bears a heavy constitutional burden.  \nSchrader v. Blackwell, 241 F.3d 783, 790-91 (6th Cir. 2001).   \n  4\n \n \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 5 of 16  PAGEID #: 59\n \n1.  The Plaintiffs will not suffer a severe restriction upon their rights if \nthey have to file their petition within 100 days of Ohio’s primary \nelection.   \n  \nOhio law, RC 3517.01 as appropriately modified by Directive 2007-09, does not severely \nrestrict the rights of any political party.  Ohio’s election regulations governing party access to the \nballot “impose equal obligations on all political parties.”  Libertarian Party, 562 F.3d at 605 \n(Griffin, J., dissenting).  In order to maintain ballot access, all political parties must have their \ngubernatorial candidate or presidential electors receive 5% of the vote.  RC 3517.01(A)(1).  If \nany political party fails to meet that threshold, as the Ohio Libertarian Party did when it \npreviously achieved ballot access, it must submit a petition with the valid signatures of 0.5% of \nqualified electors within 100 days of the primary election.  Therefore, Directive 2007-09 \nguarantees that any newly established political party will make “‘some preliminary showing of a \nsignificant modicum of support” before appearing on the ballot.”   Schrader, 241 F.3d at 791 \nquoting Jenness, 403 U.S. at 442.   \nIn this case, the Libertarian Party fails to recognize that the State of Ohio has an \nimportant and compelling state interest in requiring that either a political party or that party’s \ncandidate show a significant modicum of support before granting access to the ballot.  Id.  By \nrequiring 20,114 signatures 100 days prior to the primary election, Directive 2007-09 demands \nthat a new political party show a modicum of support before it is allowed access to Ohio’s ballot.  \nBecause Libertarian Party recognized that one must look at the combined effect of election laws \nin determining whether the law violates the constitution, this Court should examine not only the \nfact that the Ohio Constitution requires all political parties to nominate their candidates by \nprimary and that Directive 2007-09 requires that a petition from a new political party be filed \nwithin 100 days of the primary election.  Rather, this court should also recognize that the \n \n  5\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 6 of 16  PAGEID #: 60\n \nSecretary reduced the number of signatures that a new political party must obtain by 50%.  When \nexamining all of these factors, the Plaintiffs are unable to meet their heavy burden of proof and \nshow that Ohio’s ballot access requirements are unconstitutional.   \nDirective 2007-09 requires that any new political party obtain valid signatures in the \namount of 0.5% of the people who voted for governor in 2006 or 20,114 valid signatures.  On \nMarch 4, 2008, Ohio had 7,826,480 registered voters.  According to the Plaintiffs themselves, \nthey were able to generate only 6,545 signatures as of March 3, 2008.  Thus, on the day before \nthe Ohio primary, the Plaintiffs were able to submit purported signatures from 0.08% of the \nnumber of people who were registered to vote in this State and only 0.16% of the total number of \npeople who voted for governor in 2006.  The Plaintiffs 6,545 signatures further were not \nexamined by elections officials for authenticity.2  In the last statewide petition submission, only \napproximately 30% of signatures on a petition were actually valid.  Affidavit of Pat Wolfe \nattached as Exh. A. \nInstead of addressing the fact that Ohioans are apparently not interested in joining with \nthe Plaintiffs to form a new political party, the Plaintiffs simply argue that the 100 day \nrequirement to file their party petition is too far away from the general election day.  Although is \nthe Plaintiffs are correct that the Sixth Circuit ruled in Libertarian Party that Ohio’s former \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2  Under Ohio law, the Secretary of State is prohibited from accepting any petition that, on its face, fails to contain \nthe requisite number of signatures.  Furthermore, once the Secretary receives a petition for a new political party, she \nmust forward the petitions to the appropriate county boards of elections to verify the signatures.  The count boards \nof elections have a statutory obligation to verify the signatures on the petition and return the petition to the \nSecretary.  RC 3501.11(K).    \n  6\n \n \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 7 of 16  PAGEID #: 61\n \nrequirement that a party file 120 days before the State’s primary is unconstitutional, Directive \n2007-09 is constitutional because it both shortened the period of time before the primary election \nwhen a new party must file its petition as well as lowered the signature requirements.  \nFurthermore, Directive 2007-09 allowed a joint Presidential candidate to have a party identifier \nnext to his name so long the candidate filed a petition with 20,114 signatures within 80 days of \nthe election.  Both the Plaintiffs and the Libertarian Party decision focused heavily on its belief \nthat early deadlines for political parties are unfair because voters are not focused and \nuninterested in the campaign.  Libertarian Party, 462 F.3d at 586; Plaintiffs’ motion at 9-10.  \nHowever, this is simply not true any more.   \nThe lead-up to the 2008 primary election campaign showed that states across the country \naccelerated their primary and caucus schedule.  Ohio’s 2008 presidential primary occurred on \nMarch 4, 2008.  Yet, 42 states or territories held primaries or caucus elections for at least one of \nthe two major national parties before Ohio held its presidential primary.  2008 Presidential \nPrimary Dates, Federal Election Commission, attached as Exh. B.  The Iowa caucuses were held \non January 3, 2008; the Republican caucuses in Wyoming occurred on January 5; and the New \nHampshire Primary took place on January 8.  In fact, 8 different states held primaries or caucuses \nfor at least one of the major national political parties in January.  Id.  In order to prevent some \nstates from accelerating the calendar up even more, both major political parties even sanctioned \nseveral states for holding their primaries “too early.”  NY Times, GOP plans early primary \npenalty, Aug. 29, 2007, attached as Exh. C. \nSimilarly, the American electorate has been very engaged during this election cycle.  The \nofficial results for the Ohio primaries in March of 2008 show a voter turnout of 46.04%.  \nhttp://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/electResultsMain/2008ElectionResults/pturnout.aspx  \n \n  7\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 8 of 16  PAGEID #: 62\n \nThis turnout was a new record for Ohio and was the second highest turnout nationally.  2008 \nprimary falls just short of record, AU News at 1, 18 attached as Exh. D..  Likewise, the national \nturnout for primaries fell just short of a new record.  Id. at 1.  Democratic turnout produced a \nrecord in 23 states while Republican turnout produced a record in 10 states.  In addition, \nSecretary Brunner is predicting that 80% of registered Ohioans will cast a ballot in the \nNovember general election.  Ohioans are highly politically engaged.  Thus, if there were any \ndesire among Ohioans to create Libertarian Party, obtaining 20,114 valid signatures by \nNovember 26, 2007 is not a severe burden in a year when most every state has moved its primary \nor caucus in front of Ohio’s.   \nB.  The State Of Ohio has compelling interests in requiring new political \nparties to file their petition 100 days before the primary election.   \n \nThe State of Ohio has numerous compelling interests in requiring a party to file a petition \nwithin 100 days of a primary election.3  As had been previously demonstrated, each of the \nsignatures on the petition must be reviewed by the local county boards of election.  However, \nthere are preparations that both county boards of elections as well as political parties must follow \nprior to the primary election.  Starting on December 5, 2007, boards of elections can accept \napplications for absentee ballots for the March primary.  RC 3509.03, 3511.02.  Likewise, \ndeclarations of intent to change political party affiliation must be filed by 4 p.m. On December 5 \nwith those same boards of elections.  RC 3513.191(C)(1)(a).  Local boards of elections must also \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3  Although Directive 2007-09 says that the filing must be within 100 days of the election, since primary election \nday in Ohio is always a Tuesday, 100 days will always be a Sunday.  By operation of law, the filing will always be \nat least within 99 days of the election.   \n  8\n \n \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 9 of 16  PAGEID #: 63\n \ncertify all questions and issues for the primary election no later than December 20, 2007-- \nseventy five days before the election.  RC 731.28, .29, 4301.331, .331, .333, .334, 4305.14.  By \nDecember 27, the local boards must verify the sufficiency of local option petitions, RC 3513.05, \nand by December 28, statewide initiated statutes must be filed with the Secretary to be referred \nto the new year’s general assembly.  Ohio Const. Art II Sections 1a and 1b.4  Most importantly, \nhowever, is that on January 4, declarations of candidacy for nomination in the primary election \nmust be filed.  RC 3513.05.   \nSince the declaration of candidacy in order to run in a primary must be filed by January 4, \nit is important to not only give the boards of elections sufficient time to process the petition of a \nnew political party, but candidates for that party’s nomination to various offices must be \nprocessed.  Potential candidates for various offices must know that the new political party will \ncome into existence so that they can determine if they want to remain in their old parties or join \nthe new party.  Others who may wish to run for that new party’s nomination must also \nunderstand that the new party will legally exist.  Thus, there is a compelling interest for the State \nof Ohio to insure that the new party files with sufficient time to allow the party, its possible \ncandidates, its voters who can first ask for its absentee ballots starting only 10 days after the \nparty files its petition, the board of elections officials who must process the paperwork, and the \ngeneral public to make a decision about joining the new political party.  \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 The signatures on a petition for an initiated statute must be verified by the local boards of elections.  In addition, in \norder to qualify to introduce an initiated statute, the committee must submit valid signatures in the amount equal to \n3% of the number of people who voted for governor, or 6 times more than the number of signatures required for a \nnew political party.   \n \n  9\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 10 of 16  PAGEID #: 64\n \nLikewise, the State of Ohio has a compelling interest in making sure that any political \nparty that appears on its ballot has a modicum of popular support.  Schrader, 241 F.3d at 791 \nquoting Jenness, 403 U.S. at 442.  Although the Plaintiffs speak in terms of the Libertarian \nParty’s voters and supports, the simple fact is that they have been unable to demonstrate any \nsuch support.  They have produced no evidence whatsoever there is any interest in establishing a \nLibertarian Party in Ohio.  In a year of record voter turnout and interest, the Libertarian Party \nwas only able to get 6,545 unverified signatures on its petition for new party status.  \nFurthermore, it attempted to file these signatures not on the day as required by Directive 2007-09 \nbut rather on March 3, 2008 -- the day before Ohio’s primary.  The Plaintiffs do not inform this \nCourt how long it had been attempting to circulate those petitions.  The Plaintiffs do not provide \nthose petitions to the Court by way of evidentiary filing so it is impossible to tell whether the \nLibertarian Party was any more successful in obtaining valid signatures than the last statewide \nreferendum filing which garnered a 30% validity rate.  Thus, the Plaintiffs have completely \nfailed to show any modicum of support and cannot, therefore, attack the State’s compelling \ninterest in preserving the order of its ballot.   \nFurthermore, the Plaintiffs have incorrectly concluded that the State does not have an \ninterest in requiring political parties to nominate their candidates via primary.  In Ohio, the only \nway that a person can register as a member of a political party is by voting in a partisan primary.  \nBy participating in the primary, the voters have the opportunity to nominate and elect officials of \nthat party such as precinct committee representatives, county committee representatives, and \nstate committee representatives.  Furthermore, by participating in partisan primaries, voters \nbecome eligible to be nominated by political parties to work as election officials -- commonly \n  10\n \n \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 11 of 16  PAGEID #: 65\n \nreferred to as poll workers.  This also gives the political parties a better understanding of who \ntheir supporters are.   \nNominees of political parties are also automatically qualify for the ballot.  After \nsubmitting a nominating petition, any member of the political party who won the party’s \nnomination for a specific partisan office will automatically qualify for the November election.  \nAny member of the political party who decides not to file a nominating petition can still run as a \nwrite-in in the party’s primary.  Thus, the primary election enhances democratic values since all \nmembers of the political party will have a right to participate in choosing the party’s candidates \ninstead of leaving the decision in the hands of a select few.  This is more important when a new \npolitical party seeks to establish itself because new members who wish to associate with the \nparty will be able to do so.  The new party’s supporters will be able to shape the party by \nnominating its candidates and will further aid the party in its growth since they will have \nofficially registered as members of the party.   \nD.  The United States Constitution does not prohibit the State of Ohio from \nregulating federal elections.   \n \n  The Plaintiffs are incorrect in their assertion that Articles I & II of the United States \nConstitution prohibit the Secretary from passing regulations concerning federal elections.  None \nof the cases cited by the Plaintiffs support a finding that a Secretary of State cannot issue \nregulations concerning federal elections.  For example, the issue in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 \n(2000), was simply whether a standardless recount of votes violated the due process or equal \nprotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Seven justices on the Court answered that \nquestion in the affirmative with five justices determining that because the safe harbor period for \nfederal electors was approaching and no recount could be completed before that date, the recount \nin Florida must stop.  Id. at  111.   \n \n  11\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 12 of 16  PAGEID #: 66\n \n  Furthermore, there is simply nothing in the decision to suggest that a Secretary of State \ncannot issue directives as it relates to federal elections.  The Rehnquist concurrence cited by the \nPlaintiffs simply found three votes on the Supreme Court to support the proposition that Florida \nchanged requirements for the appointment of Presidential electors after the election was held in \nviolation of 3 U.S.C. 5.  There is nothing in the Rehnquist concurrent which would suggest a \nduly elected Secretary of State cannot issue directives as it relates to federal elections prior to the \nelection taking place.  That is especially true when the directive was issued in May the year \nbefore the federal election. \n  Likewise, the Plaintiffs’ reliance on Lane v. Coffman, 127 S. Ct. 1194 (2007) is \nmisplaced.  As the Plaintiffs inform this Court, the Supreme Court was prohibited in reaching the \nmerits of the case because of a lack of standing.  Since the Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the \ncase, the decisions are advisory and do not serve any precedential value.  Similarly, the Plaintiffs \nreliance on Hawke v. Smith, 253 U.S. 221 (1920), is misplaced.  The issue in Hawke was whether \na State could allow the voters to determine whether to approve a constitutional amendment.  As \nthe Hawke Court noted, Article V of the Constitution provides the methods for a State’s \nratification of a proposed constitutional amendment.  Nothing in Hawke specifies that a duly \nelected Secretary of State is prohibited from using her power to issue lawful directives even if \nthose directives impact upon the election of federal candidates.   \nE.  Ohio law gives the Secretary of State ample power to clarify the laws of \nthis State via directive. \n \n  The Ohio General Assembly has specifically given the Secretary of State the authority to \nissue directives, advisories, and memoranda to Ohio’s boards of elections.  RC 3501.01(C).  The \nDirectives have the force of all the boards of election must follow them.  RC 3501.11(P).  \nFurthermore, the Ohio Supreme Court has found that if a statute is ambiguous, the Secretary’s \n  12\n \n \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 13 of 16  PAGEID #: 67\n \ninterpretation is binding not only upon the boards of elections but upon the courts as well.  \nWhitman v. Hamilton County Board of Elections, 97 Ohio St.3d 216 (2002).   \n  Thus, Ohio law grants great discretion to the Secretary of State in order to regulate \nelections via directive.  Since Directive 2007-09 merely clarified the requirements for a new \npolitical party in light of the Libertarian Party decision, it was properly issued under the \nSecretary’s broad discretion pursuant to Ohio law.   \nF.  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  show  that  they  are  entitled  to  a  preliminary \ninjunction. \n \nBefore issuing a motion for preliminary injunction, the Court must examine four separate \nfactors:  \n(1)   Whether the movant has a “strong” likelihood of success on the merits;  \n(2)   Whether the movant would otherwise suffer irreparable injury;  \n(3)   Whether issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause harm to others; and  \n(4)   Whether  the  public  interest  would  be  served  by  the  issuance  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction.5   \nMcPherson v. Michigan High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 119 F.3d 453, 459 (6th Cir. 1997) (en banc); \nCabot Corp. v. King, 790 F. Supp 153, 155 (N.D. Ohio 1992).  The standard for granting a \npreliminary injunction is more “stringent” than that required for summary judgment.  Leary v. \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5  Secretary of State Brunner expressly reserves the right during the preliminary injunction hearing and also in a \nseparately filed motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment to expand the scope of both her legal and \nfactual arguments.  Secretary of State Brunner files this memorandum contra on an expedited basis to place on \nrecord relevant arguments, both factual and legal, as to why the Plaintiffs’ motion for emergency relief should be \nrejected.   \n \n  13\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 14 of 16  PAGEID #: 68\n \nDaeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 739 (6th Cir. 2000).  This is because “the preliminary injunction is an \n‘extraordinary remedy involving the exercise of a very far-reaching power, which is to be \napplied ‘only in [the] limited circumstances’ which clearly demand it.”  Id. (quoting Direx Israel, \nLtd.  v.  Breakthrough  Med.  Corp.,  952  F.2d  802,  811  (4th  Cir.  1991))  (internal  quotations \nomitted).   \n  As has been previously demonstrated, the Plaintiffs have failed to show any likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits.  Likewise, the Plaintiffs have failed to meet the other requirements for a \npreliminary  injunction.    Since  the  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  establish  a  violation  of  their \nconstitutional rights, they cannot show any harm in a denial of a preliminary injunction.  Summit \nCounty Democratic Central & Executive Committee v. Blackwell, 388 F.3d 547 (6th Cir. 2004).  \nLikewise, the granting of an injunction at this stage will harm others.  Candidates for various \noffices in the State of Ohio needed to determine whether to file to run in legally recognized party \nprimaries or to file paperwork to run as independents for November.  They have already done so.  \nTo grant the Libertarian Party ballot access after other candidates made their determinations \nwould greatly harm both those candidates and the general public.  Finally, because an orderly \nelection is in the public’s interests, granting an injunction allowing a new political party to \nparticipate at this late state would disrupt the process of conducting such an orderly election.    \n  14\n \n \n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 8 Filed: 06/30/08 Page: 15 of 16  PAGEID #: 69\n \nIII.

The Two Cases Present Identical Legal Issues\n  A.  Libertarian Party v. Brunner  \n  On June 6, 2008, the Libertarian Party of Ohio and five other plaintiffs filed suit against \nthe Ohio Secretary of State to challenge the constitutionality of Secretary Brunner’s Directive \n2007-09.  Secretary Brunner issued Directive 2007-09 in light of (1) the Sixth Circuit’s decision \nin Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006), in which the Court of \nAppeals struck down Ohio’s minor party ballot access laws as unconstitutional and (2) the \nGeneral Assembly’s failure to enact new laws to fill the resulting void.  The General Assembly \npassed no new legislation in response to the Court’s ruling, which left Ohio without statutory \nrules for regulating ballot access. \n  Pursuant to her authority as the State’s chief elections official, Secretary Brunner stepped \ninto the breach and issued Directive 2007-09.  Under the old law, R.C. §3517.01(A)(1), a minor \nparty seeking to secure a spot on the ballot had to file a petition no later than 120 days before the \nprimary election, and the petition had to contain signatures in an amount equal to one percent of \nthe total vote cast in the previous election.  Secretary Brunner’s Directive increased the time for \nfiling petitions, by moving the deadline up to 100 days before the primary, and cut the required \nnumber of signatures required in half. \n  On July 17, 2008, Judge Sargus struck down Directive 2007-09.  Applying the Sixth \nCircuit’s analysis in the first Libertarian Party case, Judge Sargus ruled that the less burdensome \nballot access rules contained in Directive 2007-09 continued to unduly burden First Amendment \n  3\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 25 Filed: 08/29/08 Page: 4 of 7  PAGEID #: 190\nrights.1  Judge Sargus issued a preliminary injunction and ordered Secretary Brunner to include \nthe Libertarian Party and its candidates on the 2008 general election ballot. \n  B.  Moore v. Brunner\n  Brian Moore and other members of the Socialist Party USA, filed a complaint seeking \naccess to the November ballot.  The case was first assigned to Judge Frost, but later consolidated \nwith Libertarian Party.  On August 21, 2008, Judge Sargus issued an Order commanding the \nSecretary of State to place the names of the Socialist Party candidates on the November ballot. \n  C.  McKinney v. Brunner \n  This  case  presents  the  same  legal  issue  as  the  first  two:  the  enforceability  of  the \nSecretary’s Directive.  Based on Judge Sargus’ prior ruling, the plaintiffs seek immediate access \nto the ballot as Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates for the Green Party of the United \nStates, despite the fact that the Green Party has filed no paperwork of any kind to appear on the \nballot, much less had such a request denied. \nII.  Consolidation Is Necessary To Ensure That Ballot Access Is Subject To Consistent \nRequirements \n \n  Even though Ohio currently has no ballot access statute and the Secretary of State’s \nDirective attempting to bridge that gap has also been struck down, it does not follow that Ohio \nmust allow any and every name on the 2008 ballot.  The state has an interest in keeping ballots \nwithin  manageable,  understandable  limits  because  “laundry  list”  ballots  discourage  voter \nparticipation and confuse and frustrate those who do participate.  Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S. 709, \n715 (1974). \n                                                 \n1   Alternatively, Judge Sargus ruled that under the United States Constitution, Articles I and II, the Secretary \ncould not create a structure for minor party ballot access, at least with regard to candidates for federal office, in the \nabsence of an express delegation of authority from the Ohio General Assembly to do so. \n  4\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 25 Filed: 08/29/08 Page: 5 of 7  PAGEID #: 191\n  Judge Sargus’ opinion notes that a minor party seeking ballot access must demonstrate \n“the requisite community support,” and concludes that the Libertarian Party met its burden.  \nHowever, the opinion does not provide express guidelines to help determine what the “requisite” \namount of “community support” might be, or how to measure or quantify that support.  To the \ncontrary,  Judge  Sargus  specifically  stated  that  “the  Court  will  not  prescribe  Constitutional \nelection procedures for the state.”  [Opinion, p. 14]. \n  Given the unfortunate state of Ohio’s minor party ballot access laws, the best way to \nensure some measure of consistency in ballot access is to have a single judge decide the claims \nof minor parties alleging “the requisite community support” to be on the ballot. \nIII.  Consolidation Is Justified By The Short Amount Of Time Remaining Before The \nElection  \n \n  The 2008 election is rapidly approaching, and the Secretary of State has deadlines in the \nvery near future which must be met to ensure an orderly election.  The August 21, 2008 deadline \nfor candidates to submit nominating petitions has already passed, and today, August 28, 2008, is \nthe deadline by which County Boards must certify the petition signatures.  R.C. §3513.251; R.C. \n§3513.263.  Under R.C. §3501.01, the Secretary must certify the form of the official ballots no \nlater than September 5, 2008.  And by September 30, 2008, the absentee ballots must be ready \nfor distribution.  R.C. §3509.01. \n  Given these tight deadlines, there is simply not enough time to seek appellate review of \nenough cases to establish a workable framework.  Given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, it \nis  likely  that  different  judges  may  apply  different  frameworks  and  arrive  at  inconsistent \nconclusions. Meanwhile, the lack of objective criteria will complicate the Secretary’s job and \nalmost certainly result in extra litigation. \n  5\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 25 Filed: 08/29/08 Page: 6 of 7  PAGEID #: 192\n  While there is no question that it was the General Assembly’s responsibility, in the first \ninstance, to provide a new statutory framework for Ohio elections, the fact is that the legislature \nhas not done so and there is an election coming.  By making this request, the Secretary is not \nasking Judge Sargus or any other judge of this Honorable Court to create election procedures.  \nThat responsibility belongs to the General Assembly and to the Secretary of State.  Rather, \nrecognizing  that  these  cases  do  exist  and  must  be  decided,  the  Secretary  believes  that \nconsolidation would ensure consistent outcomes, which would serve the interest of Ohio voters \nin a fair process and promote confidence in the electoral system. \nIV  Consolidation Is Justified By Considerations of Judicial Economy  \n \n  Interests of judicial economy also support consolidation, as Judge Sargus has already \nconsidered controlling precedent to resolve two other cases raising the same legal issues as in the \ncase at bar and has  authored two recent opinions that qualify as precedent.  \n  6\n\nCase: 2:08-cv-00555-EAS-TPK Doc #: 25 Filed: 08/29/08 Page: 7 of 7  PAGEID #: 193\nIV.  Conclusion\n  For the reasons set forth herein, defendant, Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner \nrespectfully asks that the Court grant the motion and transfer the McKinney case to Judge \nSargus’ docket for resolution. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n             NANCY H.

The plaintiffs are an alternative political party, its chairman, its candidates\nfor President and Vice President of the United States, one of its candidates for the United\nStates Congress, and one of its candidates for the Ohio legislature.  The individual\nplaintiffs also sue in their capacity as electors who want to support and vote for the\npolitical party plaintiff and its candidates for public office in the general election\nscheduled to be held on November 4, 2008.  The defendant is the chief elections officer\nof Ohio.\n\nCCasaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D   o  cD #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0  6  / 0 F6i/l0e8d  P06a/g0e6:/ 220 o0f8 1  2     PPaAgGeE 2ID o f# 8: 2\n2. On February 23, 2008 the plaintiffs held a convention at which they\nnominated plaintiffs Noble, Leech and other candidates for public office in the 2008\ngeneral election.\n3. On March 3, 2008 representatives of the plaintiffs filed with defendant a\npetition containing some 6,545 signatures in an attempt to qualify plaintiff Libertarian\nParty of Ohio (“LPO”) as a minor political party entitled to run candidates for public\noffice in 2008.  \n4. By letter to plaintiff Knedler dated May 22, 2008 (Exhibit A hereto),\ndefendant rejected the petition as not in compliance with defendant’s Directive 2007-09,\nissued on May 21, 2007 (Exhibit B hereto), which purported to require a party such as the\nLPO to file 20,114 petition signatures no later than November 26, 2007 in order to\nqualify to run candidates in 2008.\n5. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief from defendant’s refusal to\nvalidate their petition and from the ballot access restrictions on minor political parties\npromulgated by defendant in Directive 2007-09.  They assert that defendant’s refusal to\ngrant them access to the November 4, 2008 general election ballot unduly burdens their\nrights to cast their votes effectively, to associate for the advancement of political beliefs,\nand to have equal protection of the laws.  They further assert that Ohio has no state\ninterest which makes it necessary to burden plaintiffs’ rights.\nJURISDICTIION AND VENUE\n6.

Plaintiff LPO is an affiliation of voters formed for the purpose of\ninfluencing public policy by a variety of means, which include running candidates for\npublic office and disseminating its views on policy issues through its candidates’\ncampaigns.  The LPO was founded in or about 1972 and is the Ohio affiliate of the\nnational Libertarian Party.  It seeks to become a minor political party within the meaning\nof Ohio Rev. Code § 3501.01(F)(3).\n9. Plaintiff Kevin Knedler resides in Concord, in Delaware County, and is the\nLPO’s chairman.\n10. Plaintiffs Bob Barr and Wayne A. Root are the LPO’s candidates for\nPresident and Vice President of the United States, respectively, having been nominated\nby the national Libertarian Party as its candidates for those offices at the Libertarian\nnational convention on May 25, 2008.\n11. Plaintiff Mark Noble resides in Columbus, in Franklin County, and wants to\nbe listed on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot as the LPO’s candidate for\nRepresentative in Congress from the 15th congressional district, having been nominated\nfor that office at an LPO convention on February 23, 2008.\n12. Plaintiff Margaret A. Leech resides in Miami Township, in Clermont\nCounty, and wants to be listed on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot as the\n3\n\nCCasaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D   o  cD #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0  6  / 0 F6i/l0e8d  P06a/g0e6:/ 240 o0f8 1  2     PPaAgGeE 4ID o f# 8: 4\nLPO’s candidate for State Senator from the 14th senate district, having been nominated\nfor that office at an LPO convention on February 23, 2008.\n13. Defendant Jennifer Brunner is the Ohio Secretary of State and, pursuant to\nOhio Rev. Code § 3501.04, is the chief elections officer of Ohio.\nFACTS\n14. Ohio law provides in relevant part as follows:\na.. Political parties nominate their candidates for public office via\nprimary elections.  Oh. Const. art. V sec. 7.\nb. Primary elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday\nin May of each year, except that in years in which a presidential primary election is held,\nprimary elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March.  Ohio\nRev. Code §§ 3501.01(E)(1) and (2).  The most recent Ohio primary election was held on\nMarch 4, 2008.\nc. A political party whose candidate for governor or nominees for\npresidential elector received at least five percent of the votes cast for governor or for\nnominees for presidential elector in the most recent general election has automatic access\nto the ballot in the next primary and general elections.  Ohio Rev. Code § 3517.01(A).\nd. A party which received less than five percent of that vote may\nqualify to nominate candidates for public office (via primary election) by obtaining\npetition signatures of qualified electors equal in number to at least one percent of the total\nvote cast for governor or for nominees for presidential elector in the most recent general\n4\n\nCCasaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D   o  cD #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0  6  / 0 F6i/l0e8d  P06a/g0e6:/ 250 o0f8 1  2     PPaAgGeE 5ID o f# 8: 5\nelection, and by filing such petition signatures with defendant at least 120 days before the\nnext primary election.  Ohio Rev. Code §§ 3501.01(F)(3), 3517.012 and 3501.01(E).\n15. In the most recent general election, held in November 2006, 4,022,754\nvotes were cast for Governor of Ohio.  Were it not for the Sixth Circuit’s decision in\nLibertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006) (see infra), the\nsignature requirement for a petition to qualify a political party to nominate candidates at\nthe March 4, 2008 primary election would have been 40,228 (4,022,754 x 0.10 =\n40,227.54), and the deadline for filing such petition would have been November 5, 2007.\n16. In Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, Id., the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the combination of Ohio’s requirement that\npolitical parties nominate their candidates via primary election and its requirement that\nminor parties file a qualifying petition 120 days in advance of the primary election\nimposes “... an unconstitutional burden on [the LPO’s] First and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights of free association, by effectively preventing it from gaining access to the general\nelection ballot in the twelve months preceding a presidential election.”\n17. To date, the Ohio legislature has not amended Ohio law to fill the void in\nminor party qualifying procedures created by the Sixth Circuit’s decision.\n18. On May 21, 2007 the defendant issued Directive 2007-09 to the county\nboards of elections (Exhibit B), which provided, inter alia, that legal recognition and\nballot access would be granted to any political party which obtained petition signatures of\nqualified electors equal in number to one-half of one percent of the total number of votes\n5\n\nCCasaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D   o  cD #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0  6  / 0 F6i/l0e8d  P06a/g0e6:/ 260 o0f8 1  2     PPaAgGeE 6ID o f# 8: 6\ncast for governor in the 2006 general election, or 20,114 signatures (4,022,754 x 0.005 =\n20,113.77), and by filing such petition with defendant at least 100 days before the March\n4, 2008 primary election, i.e., by November 26, 2007.\n19. By administrative fiat, Directive 2007-09 purports to substitute a new\nrequirement that a one-half percent petition be filed 100 days before the next primary\nelection for the pre-Libertarian Party v. Blackwell requirement that a one percent petition\nbe filed 120 days before the primary, and leaves intact the pre-Libertarian Party v.\nBlackwell requirement that minor parties nominate via primary election.\n20. On February 23, 2008 the LPO held a convention at which plaintiffs Noble\nand Leech were nominated as candidates for public offices via convention as set forth in\n¶¶ 11 and 12, above.\n21. On March 3, 2008 representatives of the plaintiffs filed with defendant a\npetition containing some 6,545 signatures in an attempt to qualify the LPO as a minor\npolitical party entitled to run candidates for public office in the 2008 general election.\n22. By letter to plaintiff Knedler dated May 22, 2008 (Exhibit A), defendant\nrejected the petition as not in compliance with Directive 2007-09 (Exhibit B).\nCLAIMS\n23. Plaintiffs state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States in that the defendant’s refusal to\ngrant them access to the November 2008 general election ballot, together with the\nrestrictions on ballot access for minor political parties contained in Directive 2007-09,\n6\n\nCCasaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D   o  cD #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0  6  / 0 F6i/l0e8d  P06a/g0e6:/ 270 o0f8 1  2     PPaAgGeE 7ID o f# 8: 7\nimpair plaintiffs’ rights to cast their votes effectively and to associate politically,\nincluding their “constitutional right “... to create and develop [a] new political part[y],”\nNorman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288 (1992), and such impairment of plaintiffs’ rights\ncannot be justified by a sufficient state interest.\n24. Plaintiffs state a claim for attorney’s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\nOTHER AVERMENTS\n25. By refusing to grant plaintiffs access to the ballot, and by enforcing the\nrestrictions on minor party ballot access about which plaintiffs complain, defendant is\nacting under color of state law to deprive plaintiffs of speech, voting and associational\nrights secured by the First and Fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United\nStates.  Defendant is therefore liable to plaintiffs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nRELIEF REQUESTED\n26. WHEREFORE, plaintifffs request the following relief:\na. a declaration that defendant’s refusal to grant plaintiffs access to the\nNovember 2008 general election ballot is unconstitutional;\nb. a declaration that the restrictions on ballot access  promulgated by\ndefendant in Directive 2007-09 (Exhibit B) are unconstitutional;\nc. a declaration that defendant is in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\nd. preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting defendant from\nrefusing to grant plaintiffs access to the 2008 general election ballot or, in the alternative,\nprohibiting defendant from enforcing the ballot access restrictions in Directive 2007-09;\n7\n\nCCasaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D   o  cD #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0  6  / 0 F6i/l0e8d  P06a/g0e6:/ 280 o0f8 1  2     PPaAgGeE 8ID o f# 8: 8\ne. reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988;\nf. such other and further relief as may be just and proper.\nDated: June 6, 2008\nGary Sinawski\n180 Montague Street 26th Floor\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\nTelephone: (516) 971-7783\nTelefax: (212) 581-1516\nE-mail: gsinawski@aol.com\ns/Mark brown                          \nMark Brown, Trial Counsel\nOhio Registration No. 0081941\n303 East Broad Street\nColumbus, OH 43215\nTelephone: (614) 236-6590\nTelefax: (614) 236-6956\nE-mail: mbrown@law.capital.edu\nAttorneys for Plaintiffs\n8\n\nCCaassee:  12::0088--ccvv--0000359515--SESABS--TTSPBK   D  o Dco #c:u 1m Feinlet d1:- 026  / 0  6 F/0ile8d P 0a6g/e0:6 9/2 o0f0 182      P PAaGgEe I1D  o#f:  29\n\nCaCsaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D  o  c D #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0-62/ 0  6  / 0F8ile Pda 0g6e/:0 160/2 o0f0 182      P PAaGgEe I2D  o#f:  210\n\nCaCsaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D  o  c D #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0-63/ 0  6  / 0F8ile Pda 0g6e/:0 161/2 o0f0 182      P PAaGgEe I1D  o#f:  211\n\nCaCsaes:e 2 1:0:088-c-cvv-0-000535951-E-SASSB-T-TPSKB D  o  c D #o:c 1u mFielendt :1 0-63/ 0  6  / 0F8ile Pda 0g6e/:0 162/2 o0f0 182      P PAaGgEe I2D  o#f:  212",
