It remains the Courts intention that the parties comply with the Briefing Schedule, ECF No. 252, and submit proposed remedial plans by July 1, 2021. However, Defendants may respond, by July 20, 2021, to any remedial plan the Plaintiffs propose. Similarly, Plaintiffs may reply, by July 30, 2021, to the Defendants response. Thereafter, the Court will have all proposed plans reviewed by an independent court-appointed expert as the Court drafts a remedial plan. The Court will schedule any remedial briefings or argument as the Court deems necessary. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, Defendants Motion, ECF No. 256, is DENIED.

First, the Plaintiffs' Motion was not filed in a timely fashion and Defendants were not given an opportunity to attempt to arrange alternative means to have the witness testify. Second, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to support good cause for Plaintiffs expert witness to testify by video. Also, the Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to show good cause to allow Plaintiffs counsel to testify via video. The Court has implemented the necessary safeguards to protect the parties, witnesses, and attorneys during the bench trial to be protected from contracting COVID-19. Further the Court recommended to the parties, on September 15, 2020, that they should coordinate and make the necessary arrangements for the safety of their witnesses. Moreover, the Court was apprised today that given other trials, it does not have the equipment to conduct remote testimony in this case. Signed by District Judge Raymond A. Jackson on September 29, 2020. (Entered: 09/29/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>On November 20, 2017, Plaintiff Latasha Holloway submitted an application to proceed in forma pauperis (\"IFP\") and a proposed complaint in the Richmond Division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.&nbsp; In the proposed complaint, Plaintiff alleged that the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia's at-large election of its City Council violated the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act, and her First, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, Plaintiff sought to have the at-large voting system replaced with a system of wards or single-member districts.&nbsp; On December 13, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Appointment of Counsel.&nbsp; Plaintiff's case was subsequently transferred to the Norfolk Division of the Eastern District and assigned to Judge Arenda Wright Allen.&nbsp; The Court accepted Plaintiff's IFP application on February 12, 2018 and directed the Clerk to file the complaint.&nbsp; The Court also denied Plaintiff's Motion for Appointment of Counsel without prejudice, meaning Plaintiff could subsequently renew her request.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.&nbsp; The Fouth Circuit dismissed the appeal because it was interlocutory, <em>i.e.</em>, a non-final ruling which it lacked jurisdiction to decide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, 2018, the City filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing that Plaintiff failed to allege facts to support her claims, which were implausible on their face. &nbsp;On June 5, 2018, Plaintiff responded to the City&rsquo;s motion to dismiss, attaching an affidavit alleging factual support for her claims. Plaintiff filed multiple additional motions pro se, and on September 24, 2018, counsel noticed their appearance on Plaintiff&rsquo;s behalf. &nbsp;The next day, counsel for Holloway filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint and to withdraw all other pending motions, which the Court granted on September 26, 2018. 2018 WL 11509767. As a result, the City&rsquo;s motion to dismiss and all of Holloway&rsquo;s pending motions were dismissed as moot. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 13, 2018, Plaintiff, along with Georgia Allen, an individual who was an unsuccessful candidate for an at-large seat on the City Council, filed their amended complaint against the City of Virginia Beach, the Virginia Beach City Council and ten councilmembers in their official capacities, David L. Hansen in his official capacity as City Manager, and Donna Patterson in her official capacity as Director of Elections and General Registrar for the City of Virginia Beach.&nbsp; In contrast to the original complaint, which alleged six claims for relief, the amended complaint contained one claim for relief under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. 10301. The amended complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief&mdash;requesting a judgment that the at-large system diluted the voting strength of minority voters and an order that future City Council elections be conducted using a method that complied with the Constitution and Voting Rights Act&mdash;and damages for costs, attorneys&rsquo; fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>\r\n<p>On October 22, 2019, Defendants moved for summary judgment.&nbsp; The case was reassigned to Judge Raymond Jackson on February 26, 2020.&nbsp; Judge Jackson denied the Motion for Summary Judgment on&nbsp; March 11, 2020. On March 19, 2020, Defendants moved for limited certification of appealability, which the Court denied on April 16, 2020. 2020 WL 1891863. Defendants then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on June 30, 2020, which the Court denied on August 17, 2020, finding the matter was in fact ripe for judicial determination. &nbsp;2020 WL 4758362.</p>\r\n<p>A bench trial was held from October 6, 2020 through October 14, 2020. &nbsp;At the conclusion of the bench trial, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and law, and the Court ultimately decided the case on March 31, 2021. Before the Court issued its decision, however, Defendants informed the Court on March 22, 2021 of the enaction of HB2198, which changed the City&rsquo;s at-large system for the election of councilmembers. Specifically, HB2198 provided that any City Council candidate who was subject to a district-based residency requirement must be elected by the voters of that district, not by the locality at large. &nbsp;As a result, 7 of the 10 councilmembers would no longer be elected using the at-large system.</p>\r\n<p>Despite passage of HB2198, the Court found that the at-large election system for the Virginia Beach City Council denied Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians equal access to the electoral and political process, in contravention of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and enjoined any further use of such system. The City of Virginia Beach was further prohibited from using any practice, policy, or procedure or other action that resulted in the dilution of the minority population in the electoral process. &nbsp;The Court also granted Plaintiffs&rsquo; request for attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs, and litigation expenses. &nbsp;531 F.Supp.3d 1015.</p>\r\n<p>On April 29, 2021, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The appeal was held in abeyance, by order of the Fourth Circuit on July 12, 2021, pending the District Court&rsquo;s issuance of a remedial order and final judgment. &nbsp;On May 12, 2021, the District Court ordered the parties to submit remedial plans by July 1, 2021 to redress the at-large election system. Following the parties&rsquo; remedial plan submissions, on August 9, 2021, the District Court issued an order appointing Dr. Bernard N. Grofman, Professor of Political Science as the University of California, Irvine, as the Special Master for the purpose of submitting a report and recommendation to the District Court. The Special Master Report was filed on October 26, 2021, supplemented on December 21, 2021, and adopted by the District Court on December 22, 2021. 2021 WL 6199585. The District Court ordered the City of Virginia Beach to implement the plan.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants appealed to the Fourth Circuit on December 27, 2021, and on July 27, 2022, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the District Court&rsquo;s trial judgment as moot, given the enactment of HB2198. 42 F.4th 266. &nbsp;The Fourth Circuit remanded the case for the District Court to consider whether Plaintiffs could amend their complaint, develop the record more fully, or bring new challenges.</p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Stay the proceedings until March 2023, after the newly elected City Council for Virginia Beach had the opportunity to decide on a method for conducting elections.&nbsp; Defendants opposed the Motion to Stay and also moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Plaintiffs&rsquo; Motion to Stay and denied the Motion to Dismiss on November 15, 2022. &nbsp;2022 WL 16950269. &nbsp;On September 6, 2023, Defendants filed a notice notifying the Court and the parties that on August 15, 2023, the Virginia Beach City Council adopted a redistricting plan and authorized the implementation of a ten single-member district system of local elections, which was the plan prepared by Special Master Dr. Bernard N. Grofman.&nbsp; Plaintiffs, with the stipulation of Defendants, dismissed the action on November 27, 2023.&nbsp; This constituted the last filing in the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiff later amended her complaint to add an additional plaintiff and to narrow her claims to a single claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  The parties litigated the matter for approximately six years, which included a trial court decision in favor of the plaintiffs and an appeal to the Fourth Circuit which vacated the trial court's decision.  On September 6, 2023, Defendants filed a notice notifying the Court and the parties that on August 15, 2023, the Virginia Beach City Council adopted a redistricting plan and authorized the implementation of a ten single-member district system of local elections, which was the plan prepared by Special Master Dr. Bernard N.

      "text": "Case 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 312   Filed 11/01/22   Page 1 of 7 PageID# 10126\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR \nTHE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nNORFOLK DIVISION \n \n \nLatasha Holloway, et al., \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n              Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-0069 \nv.  \n \nCity of Virginia Beach, et al., \n \n  Defendants  \n \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n \n  Defendants are wrong to contend that this case is moot because for one day—November 8, \n2022—they will temporarily employ a lawful election system before reverting to one that violates \nthe Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\"). A claim by Plaintiffs in an amended complaint that the 7-3 system \nof election is unlawful—presently set to govern the 2024 and all subsequent Virginia Beach City \nCouncil elections—is neither speculative nor contingent on any future actions. It is the law today \nthat the 7-3 system will take effect. That Plaintiffs sought a stay of litigation in the interest of \njudicial economy, and to give the Virginia Beach City Council and the Legislature the opportunity \nto permanently adopt  a 10-district system compliant with the VRA without simultaneously \nengaging in litigation, does not make Plaintiffs’ claim unripe.   \nSTANDARD \n  “A case is fit for adjudication ‘when the action in controversy is final and not dependent \non future uncertainties. Stated alternatively, ‘[a] claim is not ripe if it rests upon contingent future \nevents that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” Scoggins v. Lee’s \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 312   Filed 11/01/22   Page 2 of 7 PageID# 10127\nCrossing Homeowners Ass’n, 718 F.3d 262, 270 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Miller v. Brown, 462 \nF.2d 312, 319 (4th Cir. 2006)). In deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction, the Court must view all factual allegations “in the light most favorable to” Plaintiffs. \nWilson v. Johnson, 553 F.3d 262, 264 (4th Cir. 2008).  \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs’ right to seek a judgment ensuring that future elections for Virginia Beach City \nCouncil  comply  with  the  VRA  cannot  be  extinguished  by  Defendants’  mere  assertion  that \nPlaintiffs have nothing to fear “until further notice.” Br. at 2, ECF No. 308. While it is uncertain \nwhether the Virginia Beach City Council will request that the Legislature amend the City Charter \nto comply with the VRA, what is certain is that Plaintiffs have a ripe claim that the system presently \nset to govern the 2024 and all future elections for Virginia Beach City Council violates the VRA. \nDefendants cannot speculate that they may, or may not, abandon the current, unlawful system and \ncontend that their bald conjecture makes this case unripe. Were that the law, no lawsuit could ever \nproceed—every law is subject to potential change in the future. The ripeness doctrine focuses on \nwhether the challenged conduct is currently in effect, not whether it might cease being in effect in \nthe future. See, e.g., Jordahl v. Democratic Party of Virginia, 122 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1997) \n(recognizing that a claim is unripe when it challenges violative conduct that arose only from “a \nstatute which is no longer in effect”). \nAs Plaintiffs explained in their Reply to Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a \nStay of Proceedings, ECF No. 311, the 7-3 system is the law of the land unless the Legislature \nadopts a Charter amendment or this Court enjoins that system. Defendants misapprehend the \nripeness doctrine; a challenge to a law is not subject to future uncertainties and thus unripe if that \nlaw is actually in effect now—as is the case here. The fact that the Legislature may in the future \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 312   Filed 11/01/22   Page 3 of 7 PageID# 10128\nchange that law does not make its current existence and injury to Plaintiffs uncertain.1 A challenge \nto the 7-3 system would only be unripe if it were not the law and Plaintiffs were merely speculating \nthat it might become the law. Here, unless the Legislature changes it or this Court enjoins it, the \n7-3 system is set by the City’s Charter. And, as has already been shown in this case, that 7-3 system \nviolates the VRA. As Special Master Dr. Bernard Grofman explained, “[t]he seven single member \ndistrict and three at-large district plan submitted by the City of Virginia Beach can be rejected on \nmultiple grounds,” including because it “creates at most two minority opportunity districts whereas \n. . . the creation of three minority opportunity districts appears to be mandated.” ECF No. 281-1 at \n25. \n  This is all in line with the Fourth Circuit’s instructions that “[o]n remand, the plaintiffs may \nraise any claims they have against the City’s system going forward.” Holloway v. City of Virginia \nBeach, 42 F.4th 266, 277 (2022) (emphasis added). The cases cited by the Fourth Circuit, as well \nas those cited by Defendants in their Motion, ECF No. 308 at 4-5, support the argument that \nPlaintiffs have a ripe claim. The circumstances in this case are akin to the circumstances in both \nNew York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. City of New York and Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp. \n“where the mootness is attributable to a change in the legal framework governing the case, and \nwhere  the  plaintiff  may  have  some  residual  claim  under  the  new  framework  that  was \nunderstandably not asserted previously.” N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc., 140 S. Ct. 1525, \n1526 (2020) (per curiam) (quoting Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 482-83 (1990)). The \n \n1 Plaintiffs are hopeful that the newly constituted City Council will request a Charter amendment \nfrom the Legislature to adopt a 10-district system and will subsequently adopt the VRA-compliant \nmap imposed by this Court without the need to litigate further and waste more taxpayer dollars. \nBut those hopes do not alter the status quo, which violates the VRA. Indeed, that the currently \nconstituted City Council (or its counsel) is fighting Plaintiffs’ good faith and sensible suggestion \nfor a stay of proceedings to permit that opportunity for legislative correction of the vote dilution \nin the 7-3 system is certainly not a good sign. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 312   Filed 11/01/22   Page 4 of 7 PageID# 10129\nFourth Circuit held that Plaintiffs’ current complaint, which it found was aimed at the existence of \nthe City’s prior all at-large system, became moot upon the passage of HB 2198 in the time between \ntrial and the issuance of this Court’s Order and Judgment. That “newly enacted legislation,” \nDiffenderfer v. Cent. Baptist Church of Miami, Fla., Inc., 404 U.S. 412, 415 (1972), has had the \nforce of imposing on Virginia Beach a system of election going forward which is still violative of \nPlaintiffs’ rights under Section 2 of the VRA.  \nThus, this is no mere “abstract disagreement[]” that could favor the Court declining to \nmaintain jurisdiction, Scoggins, 718 F.3d at 270 (citation omitted); it is a concrete dispute \nsupported by the fact that the parties’ mutually proposed Special Master concluded that the 7-3 \nsystem drawn under current law will perpetuate the vote dilution injury already proven here. In \nkeeping with the Fourth Circuit’s instructions and controlling precedent, Plaintiffs must be \nafforded an opportunity to raise the claims they have against the 7-3 system so that this Court “can \ndecide whether plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their complaint or otherwise develop the \nrecord to pursue those claims here.” Holloway, 42 F.4th at 277-78. \n  Defendants seem to prefer that Plaintiffs raise such a claim in a “new proceeding,” even if \ntheir ripeness argument fails (which it must). Br. at 5, ECF No. 308. Indeed, Defendants contend \nthat starting over in a new lawsuit before a different Court, unfamiliar with the facts and issues \nalready presented here, is “the only avenue that makes sense” and this Court should exercise its \n“discretionary” power to dismiss this lawsuit so that Plaintiffs can file a new one with a new Court. \nId. at 6. Defendants offer no explanation for why that would “make[] sense,” id., because no such \nlegitimate reasons exist. Instead, the ripeness considerations of the “fitness of the issues before the \ncourt, as well as the hardship that the parties will experience if the court withholds consideration” \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 312   Filed 11/01/22   Page 5 of 7 PageID# 10130\nfavors rejecting Defendants’ ripeness assertions. Scoggins, 718 F.3d at 270.2 This Court has spent \nconsiderable time with the facts and evidence in this case and is best suited to adjudicate a claim \nabout whether the 7-3 system also violates the VRA. That is especially true given this Court’s \nfamiliarity with the record.  \nIndeed, the Fourth Circuit recognized as much, explaining that for Plaintiffs’ claims on \nremand “the parties and the district court will likely have done much—though not all—of the work \nnecessary to analyze those claims.” Holloway, 42 F.4th at 277. That is correct, and is again \nhighlighted by Special Master Grofman’s report, which explains that the 7-3 map that the City \nproffers fails to remedy the VRA violation because the 7-district system can only produce two \nminority opportunity districts, while having three minority opportunity districts in a 10-district \nsystem “appears to be mandated” to correct the vote dilution injury here. ECF No. 281-1 at 25. \nThe record and evidence developed already in this case is integral to ensuring an efficient \nresolution of this case. Defendants get it exactly backwards, seeking to dismiss this case and \nrequiring Plaintiffs to start over in a new suit before a new Court, a course of action that Defendants \nfail to justify. \nCONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs have ripe claims against the 7-3 system of election that is the law of the land for \nVirginia Beach City Council elections beginning in 2024 and in subsequent elections. That \n \n2 Underscoring the ripeness here is the reality that if Plaintiffs are forced to wait and file a new \nlawsuit before a new Court in a time closer to the 2024 election, Defendants will most likely then \nargue that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred from seeking relief too near an election under the doctrine \nattributed to Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006). Defendants’ ripeness arguments that set up a \ngoldilocks problem where plaintiffs in election cases must seek relief at a precise yet unknown \n“right” time—not too close but not too far from the operative election—should be rejected. See, \ne.g., DNC v. Bostelmann, 466 F. Supp. 3d 957, 963 (W.D. Wis. 2020) (recognizing paradox \nbetween Purcell and ripeness, and rejecting arguments); Fitzgerald v. Alcorn, 285 F. Supp. 3d 922, \n942 (W.D. Va. 2018) (same). \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 312   Filed 11/01/22   Page 6 of 7 PageID# 10131\nDefendants are using this Court’s 10-district plan for a single election because the Fourth Circuit’s \nruling reversing the imposition of that plan was issued “too late for the City to adopt and implement \na new redistricting plan for the 2022 elections” does nothing to remedy the harm that the 7-3 \nsystem  is  set  to  inflict  on  Virginia  Beach’s  minority  voters  in  future  elections.  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that this Court accordingly deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \n \nDated November 1, 2022          Respectfully submitted, \nAnnabelle E. Harless  /s/ J.

      "text": "Case 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 313   Filed 11/07/22   Page 1 of 7 PageID# 10133\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nNORFOLK DIVISION \n \nLatasha Holloway, et al.,   \nPlaintiffs,   \nv.    Case No. 2:18-cv-0069 \nCity of Virginia Beach, et al.,   \nDefendants.   \n \nREPLY BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS \nPlaintiffs respond to the City’s motion to dismiss with a single argument. They say they \nhave a live Section 2 Voting Rights Act claim against a “7-3 system,” which they call “the law \ntoday” and the “law of the land.” ECF No. 312 at 1, 5. But the only redistricting plan that meets \nthis undefined term is last decade’s residency redistricting plan, which is malapportioned and \naccordingly is unconstitutional. Even if the City redistricts under a 7-3 framework in the future—\nwhich may never occur—there is no live controversy today over how it may configure the lines. \nUntil that future redistricting, the City will use the plan fashioned in this litigation, which Plaintiffs \ndo not challenge. No ripe claim exists, and dismissal is mandatory. \n1.  The parties largely agree on the premises of the City’s motion. Plaintiffs do not \ndeny that they have no Section 2 claim against the 10-1 plan to be used for the 2022 councilmanic \nelections. Compare ECF No. 310 at 2 with ECF No. 312 at 1. Plaintiffs do not deny that a Section \n2 challenge to a redistricting plan to be configured in the future is unripe. Compare ECF No. 310 \nat 3–4 with ECF No. 312 at 3. Plaintiffs do not deny that the Virginia Voting Rights Act provides \na threshold procedure that any plan the City may adopt must satisfy before a federal claim is proper. \nCompare ECF No. 310 at 3 with ECF No. 312. And Plaintiffs do not deny that a ripeness deficiency \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 313   Filed 11/07/22   Page 2 of 7 PageID# 10134\ncannot be overcome by holding a case in abeyance to await future injury that may never arise. \nCompare ECF No. 310 at 4 with ECF No. 312. The only disputed question is whether a live Section \n2 controversy exists, presently, concerning a “7-3 system” that Plaintiffs reference but do not \ndefine. ECF No. 312 at 1. The answer is no. \n2.  The only districting plan following a “7-3 system” that arguably qualifies as “the \nlaw today,” ECF No. 312 at 1, will never and can never be used in an election. That plan is the \nprior decade’s residency district plan, which contained three at-large seats and seven former \n“residency” districts (seats whose members were elected at-large but were required to reside within \nthe given district). Va. Code § 24.2-222(A); see Holloway v. City of Virginia Beach, 42 F.4th 266, \n271–72 (4th Cir. 2022) (describing the system). HB 2198 transformed those residency districts \ninto single-member districts in which only “the qualified voters of that district” may vote for that \ndistrict’s member. Va. Code § 24.2-222(A); see Holloway, 42 F.4th at 271. Due to HB 2198, this \nwould now qualify as a “7-3 system” with seven single-member districts (last decade’s residency \ndistricts) and three at-large districts. But the last time the City revised these residency districts was \n2011,  based  on  2010  census  results,  and  the  2020  census  revealed  the  residency-district \npopulations to be malapportioned. The percentage deviation between the largest and smallest \ndistricts exceeds the 10% total-population deviation the Supreme Court has identified as the \nthreshold at which a plan becomes presumptively unconstitutional. See  Harris v. Ariz. Indep. \nRedistricting Comm’n, 578 U.S. 253, 259 (2016); Ex. A, Declaration of Kim Brace ¶ 4. Because \nthe City has no policy basis to justify a deviation that resulted solely from the absence of \nredistricting this decade, the plan is unconstitutional.1 See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 488 \n \n1 To be sure, this omission is for good reason. By the 2020 census results were released, this Court \nhad enjoined City’s election system, leaving no reason to redistrict. However, that explanation \nwould not justify a presumptively unconstitutional plan. By the time the Fourth Circuit vacated \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 313   Filed 11/07/22   Page 3 of 7 PageID# 10135\nn.2 (2003) (“When the decennial census numbers are released, States must redistrict to account for \nany changes or shifts in population.”). \n3.  There is no ripe controversy over whether the 2011 plan also violates the VRA. \nAdjudicating the Section 2 implications of an unconstitutional plan “would have no ‘practical \neffect on the outcome of the matter,’” Holloway, 42 F.4th at 275 (citation omitted), given that the \nconstitutional deficiency standing alone prohibits the plan’s use. This mootness deficiency is \nidentical to that in Holloway, where Plaintiffs’ challenge to the City’s all-at-large system became \nmoot because the City became legally barred from using it. Id. at 273–75. The City is equally \nbarred from using the 2011 plan, this time by force of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Lopez v. \nCity of Houston, 617 F.3d 336, 339–41 (5th Cir. 2010) (finding moot VRA challenge to districts \nthat upcoming census would render obsolete). Plaintiffs agree that a challenge to a plan is not \navailable if that plan “were not the law” and may not “become the law,” ECF No. 312 at 3, but \nthey fail to see that last decade’s plan is not the law and will never be: “[a]n unconstitutional law \nis void, and is as no law.” Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 376 (1879); Montgomery v. Louisiana, \n577 U.S. 190, 204 (2016), as revised (Jan. 27, 2016) (same). Plaintiffs’ many references to the \nCity’s “reverting” to, ECF No. 312 at 1, or planning to use the 2011 plan for “the 2024 and all \nfuture elections,” id. at 2, and its status as “law of the land,” id. at 5, are simply incorrect. \n4.  Plaintiffs also seek to confuse the Court with references to the Special Master’s \nrejection of a different 7-3 plan the City proposed to this Court at the remedy phase, prior to the \nFourth Circuit’s ruling. ECF No. 281-1 at 25 (quoted at ECF No. 312 at 3). Plaintiffs vaguely \n \nthe injunction, it was too late for the City to redistrict before the 2020 elections, so it elected to use \nthe plan this Court had imposed through its injunction, even though the injunction was vacated. \nECF No. 310 at 1–2. Plaintiffs reference this choice as applicable for only “one day,” ECF No. \n312 at 1, but that day is election day, when any vote dilution would occur. \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 313   Filed 11/07/22   Page 4 of 7 PageID# 10136\nmention this proposed remedial plan, which the City later withdrew, see ECF No. 283 at 11 n.8, \nbut do not explain its relevance. ECF No. 312 at 3–4. It has none. First, it was a litigation proposal \nhaving no legal force and is “not the law.” Id. at 3. Second, it too is malapportioned and hence \nunusable. The Court directed the parties to propose remedies before the 2020 census results were \nreleased, and both parties’ proposals became outdated mid-process when that occurred, as the \nSpecial Master found. See ECF No. 281-1 at 34. Plaintiffs cannot plausibly amend their complaint \nto challenge what amounts to an obsolete data file on a consultant’s computer. \n5.  Ultimately, the gist of Plaintiffs’ position appears to be that they have generalized \nconcerns that no future 7-3 plan will yield a sufficient number of minority-opportunity districts to \nsatisfy Section 2, as they construe it. See ECF No. 312 at 3. But Plaintiffs are “merely speculating” \nabout this. Id. The City has not attempted to draw a new councilmanic district plan with 2020 \ncensus data, and only after it does so and codifies such a plan into a law that, in turn, satisfies the \nVirginia Voting Rights Act would a dispute about whether the plan as a whole satisfies Section 2 \nbecome ripe. Even if the City conducts elections under a 7-3 framework in the future—which may \nor may not occur—it could not do so without redistricting within that framework first to satisfy \nthe Constitution. It is not possible to adjudicate a Section 2 claim against a “7-3 system” in the \nabstract; a live claim requires “a particular electoral system” and a “sensitive analysis” to its \ndiscrete features. Holloway, 42 F.4th at 275–76.  \n6.  Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding this Court’s discretion (assuming any exists) fall \nwith their jurisdictional contentions, since these arguments too propose there is some value to \nadjudicating “whether the 7-3 system also violates the VRA.” ECF No. 312 at 5. It would be \nwasteful and futile to adjudicate the validity of an electoral map that will never be used in an \nelection. That is more than a “legitimate reason[],” ECF No. 312 at 4, for the Court to exercise any \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 313   Filed 11/07/22   Page 5 of 7 PageID# 10137\navailable discretion by dismissing this case. Plaintiffs are incorrect to suggest that the Fourth \nCircuit “recognized” that future proceedings will occur in this action, simply by virtue of the prior \nrecord development. Id. at 5. In fact, the Fourth Circuit expressly recognized that any residual \nclaim may be “better pursued in a new proceeding.” Holloway, 42 F.4th at 278. That is the case \nhere, where litigating the effect of a plan that will never again be used would serve no purpose, \nand it cannot be known now what effect a future plan may have. To be clear, this principle does \nnot exempt whatever plan the City ultimately uses from Section 2 scrutiny; to the extent they \nbelieve a future plan violates Section 2, Plaintiffs will be free to file a lawsuit challenging it. But \nthe time for the suit is after, not before, the plan is adopted. \nFor these reasons, the Court should dismiss this case for lack of a live case or controversy. \n \nDATE: November 7, 2022  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Katherine L.

Case No. 2:18-cv-0069 \nCity of Virginia Beach, et al., \nDefendants. \nDECLARATION OF KIMBALL W. BRACE \nI, Kimball W. Brace, declare and state pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 as follows: \n1. I have over 43 years of experience drawing electoral districts during redistricting cycles\nand in remedial phases for litigation.  This experience includes drawing electoral districts in the \nCity of Virginia Beach for the past three decades.  I was a fact witness and testifying expert during \nthe liability phase of this matter, and I submitted an affidavit during the remedial phase of this \nmatter.  Dkt. 260-1.  My curriculum vitae is familiar to this court and most recently submitted as \nExhibit A to Dkt. 260-1. \n2. This declaration is given in support of Defendants’ November 7, 2022, reply brief in further\nsupport of motion to dismiss.  I reviewed the City’s 2011 residency district plan and the 2020 \nCensus data in order to prepare this declaration. \n3. I have at multiple times over the past three decades been retained by Virginia Beach to help\nthe city review and analyze each decades’ Census results, draw redistricting plans to meet the \nrequirements of the US Constitution (one-person, one vote), the Voting Rights Act (fairly reflect \nvarious minority groups voting rights), and other state and local requirements, assist the public and \nmembers of the City Council to create plan alternatives, and present the results of that work before \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 313-1   Filed 11/07/22   Page 3 of 4 PageID# 10142\npublic hearings and City Council meetings.  I, and members of my staff, performed this work for \nthe 2010, 2000 and 1990 redistricting cycles for the City, generally in the year ending in “1” each \ndecade when the Census results were released.  Because of this Case, there was no 2020 round of \nredistricting when the 2020 Census data was finally released.  As a result, the 2011 residency \ndistricts were the last plan adopted by the City. \n4.  The final 2020 Census data for Virginia Beach recorded a total population of 459,470.  \nElection Data Services, Inc. unpacked the database file and incorporated the information into our \nredistricting software.  Incorporating 2020 Census data into the 2011 residency districts, I was \nable to determine that the 2011 residency district plan has an overall deviation of 10.2%. \n \nTable 1 \n2011 Residency Districts using 2020 Census data \n \nRaw \nDISTRICT  TAPERSONS  Target  Dev.  % Dev. \n1  68,255  65,639  2,616   3.9854% \n2  63,331  65,639  (2,308)  -3.5162% \n3  70,044  65,639  4,405   6.7109% \n4  65,266  65,639  (373)  -0.5683% \n5  64,435  65,639  (1,204)  -1.8343% \n6  64,373  65,639  (1,266)  -1.9287% \n7  63,766  65,639  (1,873)  -2.8535% \n          \n          \nSTATE \nTOT  459,470       \n          \nTotal Dev      6,713   10.2272% \nHighest      4,405   6.7109% \nLowest      (2,308)  -3.5162% \n          \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 313-1   Filed 11/07/22   Page 4 of 4 PageID# 10143\nI, Kimball Brace, am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this declaration.

This court may exercise \njurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (2012), and certain interlocutory and \ncollateral orders, 28 U.S.C. § 1292 (2012); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); Cohen v. Beneficial \nIndus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-46 (1949).  The order Holloway seeks to appeal is \nneither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.  Accordingly, we \ndismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  We dispense with oral argument because the \nfacts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and \nargument would not aid the decisional process. \n \nDISMISSED \n \n2 \n ",

Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-0069 \n           \nCity of Virginia Beach, et al.,  \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ REPLY TO PLAINTIFFS’ BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 2 of 32 PageID# 4350\nINTRODUCTION \nCOME NOW the Defendants, by counsel, and for their Reply to Plaintiffs’ Brief in \nOpposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, state as follows:  \nSTATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS \nDespite their best efforts, Plaintiffs cannot hide from the undisputed facts that form the \nbasis of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment by relying generally upon sophistic wordplay \nand misplaced editorializing about other related facts.  That Plaintiffs’ quibbles fail to create any \ngenuine material factual disputes is evidenced in both parties’ briefs. Defendants’ undisputed facts \nall arise from the content of Plaintiffs’ own expert reports, expert witness deposition testimony \nand factual allegations.  Defendants therefore reassert that, there remain no genuine material \ndisputes as to the facts essential to resolution of this Motion in Defendants’ favor.  \nDef. Facts Nos. 3 and 6: Plaintiffs and Defendants agree that Plaintiffs’ expert Anthony \nFairfax has produced a report that purports to contain his opinions.  Plaintiffs’ assertion that Fairfax \nmay have offered opinions on additional subjects to those mentioned by Defendants is not \ncontested.  There is no meaningful dispute regarding these facts. \nDef. Fact No. 7: Defendants’ statement of fact is admitted by the Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have \nonly added superfluous argument by referencing other materials from Fairfax’s report that the \nDefendants have not referenced.  There is no meaningful dispute regarding this fact as written.  \nDef. Fact No. 10: Plaintiffs do not dispute this fact as written by Defendants.  Plaintiffs \ninstead reference additional related testimony.  There is no meaningful dispute regarding this fact:  \nFairfax did not calculate margins of error for his proposed minority-majority districts.  \nDef. Fact No. 20: Spencer explained in his Rebuttal Report that “precinct-level populations \n[of Asians and Hispanics] are simply too small to draw reliable conclusions about the voting \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 3 of 32 PageID# 4351\npreferences of these groups independently.” (Ex. 5 at 6).  Spencer also testified that the information \navailable in this case does not allow him to make a reliable estimate because “[t]here are no \nprecincts where the population size of Hispanic and Asian is larger than 15 or 20 percent.”  (Ex. 4 \nat 71; see also Ex. 6 at 49-55, 68-71, Ex. 8 at 40 (Lichtman identifying 90% or greater as proper \nfor homogenous precincts and going down to 80%, if necessary)).  It is true that Spencer did not \ntestify “that Hispanic voters or Asian voters were ‘too insufficiently concentrated in precincts in \nVirginia Beach to produce reliable estimates,’” in those exact words, but that phrasing is a wholly \naccurate interpretation of Spencer’s own words.  There is no genuine dispute of fact here. \nDef. Facts Nos. 21-22: There is no genuine dispute as to these facts.  Plaintiffs do not \nattempt to rebut the language quoted directly from Spencer’s own report.  Spencer wrote that \nelections with  a minority candidate are probative.   Plaintiffs’ reference to  the appendix  of \nSpencer’s report, which concludes the Furman elections should be discounted, does not alter the \nundisputed fact that Spencer used the exact words quoted by the Defendants. \nDef. Fact No. 24: Plaintiffs apparently dispute this fact only to the extent they contend that \nSpencer reserved the right to “confirm” his work.  Spencer has not done so to date.  Spencer’s \nInitial  Report  identified  Sessoms  (2016),  Davenport  (2014)  and  Jones  (2010)  as  minority \ncandidates  of  choice.    Plaintiffs’  own  discovery  responses—which  have  not  been  further \nsupplemented  or  amended  as  to  these  three  candidacies—confirm  these  undisputed  facts.1  \nSpencer’s assertion that he may, at some unknown future date, wish to “confirm” or “double-\ncheck” (i.e., change) his statements is not a basis to dispute his current testimony.   \nDef. Fact No. 25: Plaintiffs misapprehend the undisputed material fact being identified \nhere.  The parties, and all retained experts, agree that Dr. Spencer is the only retained expert who \n \n1 See Exhibit 9 (Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Discovery Responses dated July 30, 2019, identifying \nSessoms (2016), Davenport (2014), and Jones (2010) as minority candidates of choice).   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 4 of 32 PageID# 4352\nhas generated any independent voting pattern data in this case.  To the extent Lichtman intends to \nopine on Prongs 2 and 3, he does so only to support his “totality of the circumstances” analysis.  \nMore specifically, where  Lichtman may offer opinions as to racially polarized voting, which may \noverlap in some ways with Prongs 2 and 3, Lichtman himself admits that he relies upon Spencer’s \ndata to create his tables (this includes those initially produced or subsequent to his deposition) and \nLichtman has not generated his own independent data in this case. (See Ex. 8 at 44-46, 220-221).  \nTherefore, it is undisputed that Spencer’s voting pattern data is the exclusive data source for \nPlaintiff’s voting pattern statistical evidence in this case.  \nDef. Fact No. 27: It is undisputed that three candidates listed by Spencer in his Initial \nReport as minority candidates of choice in the Furman elections – Sessoms (2016), Davenport \n(2014), and Jones (2010) – were not listed in Table 1 of Spencer’s Rebuttal Report.  Plaintiffs \ndistract  from  that fact  by arguing over whether these three elections  should be considered \nprobative.  Regardless of the attempted explanation, these three successful candidates, who were \npreviously  identified  by  Spencer  and  by  Plaintiffs  as  minority  candidates  of  choice,  were \nundisputedly not included in Table 1 of Spencer’s Rebuttal. \nDef. Fact No. 29: The material fact in this paragraph is that Spencer, through counsel for \nPlaintiffs, provided a data set to the Defendants, by email, on September 5, 2019 which comprised \nthe underlying data Spencer used to generate Table 1 in his Rebuttal Report.  This was the first \ntime this data was produced in this format to the Defendants.  Plaintiffs’ quibbling about whether \nproviding a “code” is equal to providing the expert’s actual calculated data as eventually produced \n(along with a baseless insult) does not create a genuine dispute about Spencer’s Data Set.  While \nPlaintiffs may disagree with Defendants’ recounting of the process by which Plaintiffs provided \nthe Data Set, the email and attachment provided on September 5, 2019 show that Spencer provided \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 5 of 32 PageID# 4353\npoint estimates for Hispanic voters (alone) and Asian voters (alone) for the 13 candidates he \nanalyzed in Table 1 of his Rebuttal Report. There is no genuine dispute about the material facts.  \nDef. Fact No. 30. Plaintiffs assert this quote from Spencer’s Initial Report is taken “out of \ncontext” but do not explain their assertion or point to any language providing a fuller context. \nDefendants invite the Court to review the Rebuttal Report, confident it will reach the same \nconclusion.  Plaintiffs have no basis whatsoever for challenging a material fact where their own \nexpert’s written report is directly and accurately quoted. \nDef. Fact No. 31. This is a direct quotation from Exhibit 6 at 125. Plaintiffs make no effort \nto dispute the accuracy of the quote from Spencer’s Deposition. Plaintiffs’ reliance on other \nportions of the deposition amount to nothing more than argument and obfuscation. Plaintiffs’ \ndenial of this fact is also deeply misleading for the reasons explained previously and further \nexplained herein. (See ECF No. 115 at 24, n. 12).  \nDef. Fact No. 33. Plaintiffs have not disputed the stated fact that Spencer’s Data Set shows \nonly 6 of 13 candidates analyzed received 50% or more support from both Black voters and \nHispanic voters.  Plaintiffs have not disputed that Spencer’s Data Set shows only 3 of 13 candidates \nanalyzed received 50% or more support from both Black voters and Asian voters. (Ex. 7). Plaintiffs \ndispute of the appropriate “threshold” is a legal argument that is not a proper basis to dispute a \nclear fact that Plaintiffs do not actually challenge. \nDef. Fact No. 34: Plaintiffs’ dispute again relies on Spencer’s apparent desire to at some \nundefined later date “double-check” his work.  Spencer has not provided any supplementation to \nhis Initial Report, his Rebuttal Report, and his deposition testimony. Spencer’s statement that he \nmay, at some unknown future date, wish to “confirm” a fact is not a basis to dispute a material fact \nwhere the record before this Court is clear.  To the extent Spencer were to later provide opinion \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 6 of 32 PageID# 4354\ntestimony or evidence that Flores should be included as a minority candidate of choice, as \nPlaintiffs’ counsel apparently hopes, the result of Table 1 would still show four of eight minority \ncandidates of choice winning their elections.  \nDef. Fact No. 35: By Lichtman’s own admission, his analysis is predicated on and \ninformed by Spencer’s data. Lichtman did not generate his own data.  (See Ex. 8 at 44:16-18 \n(Lichtman testified that “I did not do any of my own independent statistical analysis of racially \npolarized voting.”); see also id. at 118-122, 220-222). Plaintiffs cannot dispute this fact.   \nDef. Fact Nos. 37 and 39: Lichtman stated in deposition testimony: “I also don’t think you \ncan isolate Hispanic and Asian voting….” and “…you can certainly get estimates, but the error \nmargins are going to be large, which is why you’ve got to use the equivalence testing analysis.”  \n(See Exhibit 8 at 58;  see also Exhibit 8 at 216, (“As I said, you can’t isolate Hispanics and \nAsians….”)).  While Defendants agree with Plaintiffs’ apparent admission that equivalence testing \nis not appropriate in the present context, Lichtman’s testimony makes clear be believed Spencer’s \noriginal data to be insufficient to isolate the voting preferences of Hispanics and Asians.  \nARGUMENT \nIn  Plaintiffs’  Brief  in  Opposition  to  Defendants’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment \n(“Response Brief”), they contend that Defendants misunderstand the complex issues involved in \nthis  litigation.    However,  having  confirmed  in  their  Response  Brief  both  their  inability  to \nstatistically  isolate  Hispanic  and  Asian  voting  preferences  in  Virginia  Beach  and  the \ninappropriateness of using equivalence testing for such purpose, Plaintiffs cast about to survive \nsummary judgment by employing various smokescreens and  alternative theories designed to cloak \nthe patent insufficiency of their evidence.  Defendants arguments presented herein demonstrate \nhow easily the smoke is cleared away to reveal facts that warrant summary judgment in their favor. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 7 of 32 PageID# 4355\nI.  Coalition Claims are Not Cognizable under the Voting Rights Act.  \nPlaintiffs’ use a substantial portion of their Response Brief addressing the unresolved \nthreshold legal question of whether a multiracial coalition claim is cognizable under the Voting \nRights  Act.    Plaintiffs’  treatment  of  the  Fourth  Circuit’s  opinion  casting  doubt  on  the \nappropriateness of coalition claims is unpersuasive.  Though it appears in dicta, the Fourth \nCircuit’s analysis and commentary simply is not limited to crossover districts, as Plaintiffs \ncontend.  Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421, 431 (2004).  In fact, the opposite is true.  The plain \nlanguage employed by the Fourth Circuit reveals it is making a broader statement that the viability \nof coalition district claims is doubtful at best.  In Hall, the Fourth Circuit cites Nixon favorably \nand makes the general statement that “any construction of Section 2 that authorizes the vote \ndilution claims of multiracial coalitions would transform the Voting Rights Act from a law that \nremoves disadvantages based on race, into one that creates advantages for political coalitions that \nare not so defined. Id. at 431 (emphasis added). \nFollowing the holding of the Sixth Circuit in Nixon, and considering the strong indication \nof support the Fourth Circuit provided in Hall, this Court should hold as a matter of law that the \nVoting Rights Act does not allow multiracial coalition vote dilution claims.   \nII.  Plaintiffs Grossly Mischaracterize Spencer’s Use of Equivalence Testing. \n \nThere is no better example of Plaintiffs’ chameleon-like approach in advancing their claim \nthan their bald mischaracterization of Spencer’s use of Equivalence Testing, a dubious approach \nthat makes a virtue of unreliable data and the use of which Spencer ultimately disavowed in his \ndeposition testimony.  It is a truly remarkable element of this litigation. \nIn Plaintiffs’ Response Brief, they charge that “Defendants mischaracterize why Dr. \nSpencer provided individual estimates of voter preferences for each racial group, and why he \nperformed equivalence testing in the first place.”  (ECF No. 118 at 36).  Plaintiffs go on to assert \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 8 of 32 PageID# 4356\nthat “the purpose of Dr. Spencer’s calculation of individual estimates, along with equivalence \ntesting, was to show that the individual estimates alone are not reliable measures of candidate \npreference, and thus why he necessarily relied on the combined minority estimates in his initial \nreport.” (ECF No. 118 at 37 (emphasis added)).  This is a galling claim—being either flatly untrue \nor an admission that Defendants were badly deceived in the first instance. \nAs a matter of simple logic, it is inconceivable why Spencer would expend the time and \neffort of misapplying a novel approach—never before used in a Section 2 Voting Rights Act \nclaim—simply to prove an assertion that is not contested: the Hispanic and Asian populations in \nVirginia Beach are not concentrated enough to produce reliable voter support estimates. What is \nstranger yet about Plaintiffs’ gloss on this topic is that equivalence testing’s use of overlapping \ndistribution ranges does not prove anything about the underlying reliability of the data points used.2  \nHad Spencer wanted to emphasize the unreliability of Asians and Hispanic datapoints for voters, \nconsidered separately, he simply could have produced Spencer’s Data Set in his Rebuttal Report \n(which he did not do) and explained that the confidence intervals were far too large to rely upon. \n \n2   During Spencer’s deposition testimony, Defendants exposed the absurdity of Spencer’s \nuse of Equivalence Testing by asking questions about its application to unreliable datapoints (i.e. \nthose having large confidence intervals). As Defendants explained in their Brief in Support, \nSpencer confirmed that the larger the confidence interval in question (i.e. the more unreliable the \ndatapoint), the more likely Spencer was to find the distribution overlap he used as a measure of a \ngiven group’s support for a particular candidate. Spencer was thereafter forced to admit that \nequivalence testing has no place in this litigation.  \n  In  making  the  implausible  assertion  that  Spencer  was  using  equivalence  testing  to \ndemonstrate  that  he  could  not  produce  reliable  point  estimates  for  Asians  and  Hispanics, \nseparately, Plaintiffs fail to make a key distinction: although Defendants were able to highlight the \nabsurdity  of  Spencer’s  conclusions  by  pointing  out  his  reliance  on  unreliable  datapoints, \nequivalence testing itself does not measure of the reliability of those datapoints. Stated differently, \nthe results reached through equivalence testing are affected by the reliability of the datapoints: \nequivalence testing does not measure the reliability of those datapoints. Spencer himself explained \nthat equivalence testing is a method of comparing groups, (Ex. 6 at 124-127), not measuring the \nreliability of data points. Lichtman also confirmed that equivalence testing has no impact on the \nreliability of datapoints. (Ex. 8 at 226:3-7).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 9 of 32 PageID# 4357\nWhy, then, did Spencer feel the need to build the peculiar Rube Goldberg contraption that \nis Equivalence Testing? Further, why create a table based upon an approach that Plaintiffs now \nseem to suggest was used for ironic effect only? A more likely common-sense answer is that \nSpencer employed a desperate measure to try to save the Plaintiffs’ crumbling case but was forced \nto retreat when the folly of his efforts was exposed.  Plaintiffs’ final attempt at explaining this \nchicanery is revealed by the striking contrast between how Spencer describes Table 1, whose \ninputs are based upon his equivalence testing, in his deposition testimony as compared to the \nexplanation he provided in his Rebuttal Report.  In Spencer’s deposition, he testified: \nProcedurally, I don’t think Table 1 is very meaningful, which is why I did not \ngenerate it for my original report. I don’t think the estimates that are used in this \ntable actually mean much. I am not confident in their findings at all, but I generated \nit in response to some comments made by Dr. Kidd to try to—to try to point out \nexactly why I didn’t do this in my original report. \n \n(emphases added). Compare that with Spencer’s statements about the same Table 1 in his Rebuttal \nReport (which was generated prior to Defendants’ receipt of Spencer’s Data Set and Spencer’s \ndeposition):  \nIn Table 1, I present a summary of minority support for the thirteen candidates (ten \nblack, three white) that I identified as minority candidates of choice in my report. \nIn 11 of the 13 cases, I find that coalitional voting was sufficient enough for \nminority-preferred candidates to have been elected in the absence of white bloc \nvoting. In just two of the 13 cases (Cabiness in 2014 and Jackson in 2010) I find \nthat minority support was likely not due to coalitional voting. \n \n(emphases added).  Neither this nor any other passage found in the Rebuttal Report suggests even \na whiff of ironic distance between Spencer’s actual views and his many statements about (and \nbased upon) equivalence testing.  Defendants took at face value both Spencer’s question, “How do \nwe make sense of this uncertainty [caused by large confidence intervals]?” and his answer, “To \ndraw my conclusions, I adopt the logic of equivalence testing.” (emphasis added).  Spencer now \neschews the logic of equivalence testing.  That is seismic shift of opinion. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 10 of 32 PageID# 4358\nThe Plaintiffs have continually shifted their basis for proving cohesion: first offering only \nan “All Minority” data point that is plainly insufficient; next attempting to cure this deficiency by \noffering equivalence testing; and finally retreating to their first position when the absurdity of their \nsecond attempt was exposed.  Although it is somewhat unfair that Defendants are asked to defend \nthis case on a field of shifting sands, for the reasons expounded upon infra it is of no moment \nbecause all of Plaintiffs’ approaches fail. \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Admissions Confirm that Their Evidence Cannot Prove Cohesion \nAmong Black, Hispanic, and Asian Voters \n \na.  Plaintiffs’ “All Minority” voter support data is insufficient to prove cohesion. \n \nPlaintiffs make clear throughout their Response Brief that they no longer wish to rely upon \nthe opinions and conclusions that Spencer set forth in his Rebuttal Report.  Instead, Plaintiffs now \nreturn to the “All Minority” voter support datapoints Spencer provides in his Initial Report—which \nare a combined estimate of the support of Black, Asian, Hispanic, and all other non-White voters—\nclaiming they constitute competent evidence to prove cohesion. Plaintiffs further insist that “[t]he \nparties’ disagreements over the reliability of a combined minority estimate” give rise to a “classic \n‘battle of the experts.’” (ECF No. 118, at 18).  The truth, however, is that the “All Minority” \ndatapoints do absolutely nothing to prove cohesion among the three specific minority groups in \nquestion, and no special expertise is needed to reach this inescapable conclusion.  Rather, all that \nis needed is a reliance upon simple logic and basic math. \nThe Plaintiffs’ watchword regarding the “All Minority” voter datapoints is “reliability.” It \nwell  may  be  that  their  “All  Minority”  datapoints  are  “reliable”,3  but  Plaintiffs  grossly \n \n3 For purposes of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants do not challenge the \nreliability (i.e. general accuracy) of the “All Minority” voter support datapoints offered by Dr. \nSpencer and do not object to the Court’s assuming arguendo that the datapoints are accurate. As \nexplained herein, Defendants argue only that Plaintiffs and their experts misuse these datapoints \nas their evidence of cohesion.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 11 of 32 PageID# 4359\nmisunderstand for what purpose these datapoints may be reliable. In fairness, Plaintiffs hit the \nmark as to the narrow reliability of the “All Minority” datapoints exactly once, stating, “Dr. \nSpencer’s ‘All Minority’ estimate is exactly what Plaintiffs’ experts say it is: an estimate of the \npreferences of Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters together.”4 (ECF No. 118 at 15 (emphasis \noriginal)).  That is exactly correct. However, whatever reliability the “All Minority” datapoints \nhave begins and ends with their being estimates only of the total voting support level for all \nminority groups when combined together. \nThe pivotal question is: How can a datapoint that combines all minority groups together \ninto a single datapoint ever serve as a basis for comparing or contrasting three (or more) constituent \ngroups that are included therein?  The answer is simple: they cannot. Neither can these created \ndatapoints themselves justify the choice to band these groups together in the first place. \nA  hypothetical  example  may  be  useful  in  explaining  why  the  “All  Minority”  voter \ndatapoints do nothing to prove cohesion  amongst the constituent groups.  Plaintiffs voiced \ndispleasure with Defendants’ “Jack and Jill” hypothetical, complaining that it was “based on a \nsingle measurement” only—whereas Spencer “use[s] three different statistical models.” (ECF No. \n118 at 16).  Perhaps Plaintiffs will be more amenable to the example of Mack and Bill. Assume an \naccountant wants to compare the net worth of Mack, a plumber, and Bill, the owner of a large \nsoftware company.  However, the accountant can arrive at a reliable estimate only for the average \nnet worth of Mack and Bill combined—not of each man. Could a combined “Both Mack and Bill” \ndatapoint, estimating the two men’s average net worth at $30 billion, serve as a basis for comparing \n \n4 The Plaintiffs are generally correct, here, but omit the fact that other non-White voters also are \nincluded in these datapoints, as Dr. Spencer himself explains in his Initial Report. (See, e.g., Ex. 4 \nat 9 (“All minority support includes Hispanic, Asian, and other minority groups”), Ex. 4 at 13 (the \nlisted p values are based on “minority vs. white support”)).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 12 of 32 PageID# 4360\nthe net worth of these two men to each other?  Further, could one take this datapoint as proof that \nMack and Bill have a similar net worth? \nBefore answering these questions, some additional details may serve to inoculate this \nhypothetical  against  Plaintiffs’  aforementioned  critique.    Suppose  now  that  this  brilliant \naccountant—who is much smarter than Defendants and their experts—uses three highly complex \nmethodologies to produce three different estimates of the average net worth of Mack and Bill: $28 \nbillion, $30 billion, and $33 billion. In that case, could any of these three “Both Mack and Bill” \naverage net worth estimates—or any pattern observed between all three estimates—ever serve as \na basis for comparing Mack’s net worth with Bill’s net worth?  The answer is a resounding “no.”  \nOne needs no special expertise to understand this point. \nFor the same reason, Spencer’s All Minority datapoints do not—and cannot—provide a \nbasis for comparing the constituent groups incorporated therein.  The numerosity and complexity \nof Spencer’s methodologies in arriving at these estimates does not alter this basic fact.  Spencer \nopined that the “most reliable method for interpreting the candidate preferences of Black, Hispanic, \nand Asian voters it to estimate their joint vote share.” (Ex. 5 at 6).  This statement is facially absurd, \nand Plaintiffs cannot point to anything in Spencer’s report explaining how he can determine the \ncandidate preferences of an individual group by looking at this “joint vote share number.”  The \nreason is that he cannot do it.  Instead, he merely presumed these groups share the same preference.  \nb.  Comparing Black voter support to the All Minority voter support datapoint \nactually suggests a lack of cohesion amongst these three groups.  \n \nIn order to demonstrate cohesion amongst three minority groups, one must compare the \nminority groups’ voting preferences to each other.  Spencer acknowledges as much in both his \nInitial Report and in his deposition testimony.  This common-sense principle is also affirmed by \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals’ holding in Brewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1989).  If \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 13 of 32 PageID# 4361\nSpencer actually had conducted such a comparison of each group to the others in his Initial Report, \nhis analysis might give rise to a so-called “battle of the experts.” But no such comparisons were \never performed. \nThe only comparison of datapoints that Plaintiffs or their experts undertake is between \nestimates for Black voter support and All Minority voter support. This comparison is to no avail \nfor the reasons set forth in Defendants’ initial Brief in Support: because the Black voting age \npopulation in Virginia Beach is larger than the combined voting age populations of Hispanics and \nAsians in Virginia Beach, strong Black support for a given candidate can mask weak support \namong Hispanics and/or Blacks. \nPlaintiffs nonetheless have the temerity to assert that “the combined estimate is not \n‘masking’ differences between racial groups.” (ECF No. 118 at 16).  Plaintiffs specifically point \nto the 2016 Kempsville election that pitted Dr. Amelia Ross-Hammond, an African American \nincumbent, against Jessica Abbott to support their contentions.  This is a curious choice on \nPlaintiff’s part.  In his Initial Report, Spencer estimates Black support for Ross-Hammond at \n83.3% using ecological regression (“ER”) and 76.8% using ecological inference (“EI”). (ECF No. \n118 at 16).  Spencer estimates All Minority support for Ross-Hammond using these two methods \nat 65.9% and 59.9%. Thus, these two estimates reveal gaps between Black and All Minority \nsupport of 17.4% and 16.9%, respectively. Spencer’s homogenous precinct (“HP”) estimates for \nBlack and All Minority support are nearly identical to each other—though Spencer gives “less \nweight” to this method because of the lack of homogenous precincts in Virginia Beach.5 (ECF No. \n118 at 91). \n \n5 Lichtman testified that in conducting homogenous precinct (“HP”), or ‘extreme case’ analysis, \nhe would “like to get at 90 percent [precinct population] for whatever group I’m looking at. \nSometimes you can’t get there and you’ve got to go down to 80 percent.” (Ex. 8 at 40: 4-7.) Spencer \ntestified that there was not a single Virginia Beach precinct with an all-minority population that \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 14 of 32 PageID# 4362\nThe parties have sharply divergent views about what the above-cited datapoints indicate, \nbut facts and logic support only the Defendants’ view.  Defendants aver that without any data \nregarding Asian and Hispanic voters, considered separately, simple logic dictates that one simply \ncannot conclude that each of the three groups preferred Ms. Ross-Hammond.  Further, Defendants \nmaintain that the substantial gap between the Black and All Minority datapoints (using Spencer’s \ntwo preferred methods) actually indicates strongly that, because Black voters are included in the \nAll Minority estimate, the combined Asian and Hispanic voter support must be substantially lower \nthan Black support.  Plaintiffs—who seem to believe that the immutable operation of mathematical \naverages somehow does not apply to their inconvenient data—contend that this same data indicates \nthat “[i]n this race, Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters together strongly preferred Ross-Hammond \nover Abbott.” (ECF No. 118 at 16 (emphasis added)).  To Plaintiffs, this dispute is more evidence \nof a “battle of the experts.” It simply is not.  \nWere basic logic not sufficient to resolve this “dispute” in Defendants’ favor—though it \nis—Spencer’s own data settles the matter definitively.  According to Spencer’s Data Set, generated \nusing a modified EI method, Black support for Ross-Hammond was 81.2%, closely tracking his \noriginal EI and ER estimates.  Hispanic support is estimated at 49% and Asian support at 26.2%.6  \n(Ex. 7).   Spencer’s own data thus indicates that the All Minority voter datapoint did indeed mask \ndramatically weak support for Ross-Hammond among Asian voters. Two other implications \nregarding this two-person race are that Hispanic voters were split roughly evenly between the two \ncandidates while Asian voters favored Ms. Abbott decisively.  One wonders whether the actual \n \nexceeded 70 percent. (Ex. 6 at 49-50). It appears by the account of Plaintiffs’ witnesses that HP \nanalysis has no value in this case—though its consideration does not alter the Defendants’ analysis \nto any degree. \n6 This estimate of Asian support at 26.2% is also the basis for Spencer’s inclusion of an “x” in \nTable 1 of the Rebuttal Report, which indicates Asians did not support Ross-Hammond in 2016. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 15 of 32 PageID# 4363\nwill of Asian and Hispanic voters—who are entirely and conspicuously absent as plaintiffs in this \ncase—is of genuine concern to the Plaintiffs. \nThe data regarding Prescott Sherrod’s 2011 candidacy is one of a host of other examples \nthat  confirms  Defendants’  assertion  about  the  operation  of  averages  and  reveals  Plaintiffs’ \nfalsehood that the All Minority datapoint is not masking low or wildly divergent Asian and \nHispanic support levels.  In Spencer’s Initial Report, he produces ER and EI estimates of Black \nsupport for Sherrod at 92.4% and 87%, respectively.  (Ex. 4 at 22). Spencer’s ER and EI estimates \nof All Minority support are 70.9% and 64.8%, respectively. (Ex. 4 at 22).  Plaintiffs ask the Court \nto consider this data as proof of cohesion.  Defendants contend it suggests just the opposite. But \nnow consider that, Spencer’s Data Set estimates Black support for Sherrod at 90.2%, Hispanic \nsupport at 49.5%, and Asian support at 27.2%.  (Ex. 7).  This same startling trend is apparent, with \nfew exceptions, throughout Spencer’s Data Set. In the end, the immutable laws of mathematics \nand logic devastate Plaintiffs’ contentions. \na.  Spencer’s Data Set is a death knell for Plaintiffs’ claim that cannot be un-\nrung \n \nDefendants averred in their Brief in Support that Spencer’s Data Set represents a final fatal \nblow to Plaintiffs’ claim.  Defendants maintain that this is so, for although the datapoints contained \nin Spencer’s Data Set are far from precise, they nonetheless point unmistakably towards the \nconclusion that cohesion simply does not exist among these three minority groups. Further, this \ndata indicates that neither Hispanic nor Asian voters are cohesive within their own groups—a \nconclusion that becomes even more apparent when one considers data Spencer omitted. \nPlaintiffs complain in their Response Brief that Defendants’ Table A, which represents \nsome of the data provided in Spencer’s Data Set, is “meaningless when put into context,” given \nthat  Defendants  did  not  include  the  wide  confidence  intervals  attached  to  Spencer’s  point \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 16 of 32 PageID# 4364\nestimates. (ECF No. 118 at 37). A full copy of Spencer’s Data Set—including the standard error—\nis included, here: \n \nSpencer’s Data Set was produced to Defendants on September 5, 2019, in the format shown above—and to which \nDefendants have highlighted the point estimates for each minority group presented. \n \nThe contrasts presented in this table are remarkable.  For one, the average gap between \nBlack and Asian voters is a whopping 35%.  The Amended Complaint’s assertion that “Hispanic \nand Asian voting patterns track Black voting patterns,” therefore is demonstrably false. (ECF No. \n62 at ¶ 62).  In their Response Brief, Plaintiffs cite Campos v. Baytown, a case from the Fifth \nCircuit holding that Section 2 claims based on cohesive coalitions are cognizable. 840 F.2d 1240 \n(5th Cir. 1988).  In Brewer v. Ham, however, the Fifth Circuit refined Campos’ sometimes vague \nlanguage regarding the cohesion standard that applied to coalition cases, while affirming Campos’ \nunambiguous common-sense holding that, “if one part of the group cannot be expected to vote \nwith the other part, the combination is not cohesive.”  876 F.2d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 1989) (quoting \n840 F.2d at 1245).  The simple truth that Asians cannot be expected to vote with Blacks is \nsufficient, by itself, to end the analysis of this case and grant summary judgment to Defendants. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 17 of 32 PageID# 4365\nAnother vivid contrast highlighted by Spencer’s Data Set is between the apparent pattern \nof cohesion among Black voters and the lack of a similar pattern of cohesion among Hispanic \nvoters (standing alone) and among Asian voters (standing alone).  At least for the elections \npresented in Spencer’s table, Black support in most cases would appear to meet the 60% cohesion \nthreshold adopted by this Court in Smith v. Board of Supervisors, 801 F. Supp. 1513, n.11 (E.D.Va. \n1992)—which ironically was proposed by Dr. Allan Lichtman, one of Plaintiffs’ experts in this \ncase.  Hispanic support for the same candidates runs the gamut, however, ranging from as low as \n13% to as high as 79.9%.  Moreover, Hispanic voter support levels are distributed fairly evenly \nbetween the two extremes, with six (6) cases above 50% and seven (7) cases below 50%.  The \nextreme ranges, and scattered levels, of support also are observable in regard to Asian voters.  One \nmust necessarily conclude that in many of these races—some of them involving only two or three \ncandidates—Hispanic voters and Asian voters must have strongly preferred a different candidate \nthan the one preferred by Black voters.  Spencer’s omission of estimates for any other candidates \nsaves  Plaintiffs  the  embarrassment  of  these  inconvenient  facts—but  only  until  one  gives  a \nmoment’s consideration as to what his presented data suggests about his omitted data. \nGiven that Spencer’s Data Set suggests Hispanics and Asians are not cohesive even among \ntheir own groups, it is difficult to conceive of the standard Plaintiffs would have this Court adopt \nwhich would allow it to find cohesion among all three groups.  Certainly, any such standard would \nbe far lower than the 60% threshold their own expert (Lichtman) offered in Smith. Moreover, \nPlaintiffs implicitly ask this Court to find that, as a plaintiff adds more minority groups to a Section \n2 claim, the standard for cohesion becomes more relaxed.  That notion is entirely at odds with \ncommon sense, doesn’t comport with Spencer’s own standard that “each group has the most \npreferred candidate, and the most preferred candidate of each three groups is the same” (Ex. 6 at \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 18 of 32 PageID# 4366\n109), ignores the Supreme Court’s admonition in Emison v. Growe, and violates the standard \nadopted by the U.S. Circuit that has been most receptive to coalition claims. See 507 U.S. 25, 41 \n(1993); Brewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 454 (5th Cir. 1989).  \nIt is little wonder, then, that Plaintiffs vigorously wish to disavow Spencer’s Data Set. \nPlaintiffs state that it is “puzzling” that Defendants would acknowledge that Spencer’s Data Set \nincludes datapoints that are unreliable and then “proceed to use these same unreliable estimates to \ncomment on candidate preferences.” (ECF No. 118 at 37).  It must first be noted that in presenting \nTable  1—without  the  slightest  hint  of  irony—it  was  Spencer  himself  who  first  advanced \nconclusions based upon the Data Set. \nSetting aside that bit of hypocrisy, however, the appropriate use of Spencer’s Data Set does \nwarrant discussion.  Both parties agree that one cannot generate reliable estimates of Asian and \nHispanic voter support in Virginia Beach because the attached confidence intervals (or standards \nof error) are simply too large.  This undisputed truth does not mean, however, that Spencer’s Data \nSet is of no value whatsoever.  For one thing, some of the datapoints included therein are more \nreliable than others.  Consider, for example, the point estimates for Hispanics and Asians with the \nlowest corresponding confidence intervals. (Ex. 6 at 45:3-4 (Spencer testified at his deposition that \n“the larger number of confidence interval means the less confidence.”)).  \nFor Asian voters, the most reliable datapoints are the point-estimates of support for Andrew \nJackson in the 2010 at-large election and Rita Sweet-Bellitto for that same election.  The standard \nerrors for these datapoints, 5% and 6.4% respectively, are equal to or less than the standard error \nattached to Spencer’s point estimate for Black support of Aaron Rouse in the 2018 at-large race, \nwhich Spencer believes is reliable using ER. (Ex. 6 at 13).   For Hispanics, the least unreliable \ndatapoints are those for candidate James Cabiness in the 2014 Rose Hall race and the 2010 Jackson \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 19 of 32 PageID# 4367\ncandidacy. These four point-estimates for Asian and Hispanic support—the most reliable of the \nData Set—constitute strong evidence that these two minority groups are not cohesive with Black \nvoters.  Even when the corresponding confidence intervals are factored in, the distribution ranges \nfor Hispanic and Asian support do not come close to overlapping the range of possible Black \nsupport. \nSpencer’s Data Set also possesses value for a second reason.  Viewed as a whole, it \nconfirms Defendants’ contentions about the implications of the Black support and the All Minority \nsupport datapoints included in Spencer’s Initial Report.  Although each individual point estimate \nin Spencer’s Data Set is not particularly accurate or reliable, the unmistakable pattern that emerges \ndemonstrates the correctness of Defendants’ two core contentions about what can be gleaned by \napplying mathematical averages to the All Minority data contained in Spencer’s Initial Report: (1) \nSpencer’s original data indicates that, in most elections he analyzed, Asian and Hispanic combined \nsupport must be markedly lower than Black support, and (2) it is likely that in each such instance, \neither  Asian  or  Hispanic  individual  support  is  even  lower  than  that  combined  percentage.  \nAlthough no evidence is required to prove these mathematical truths, Spencer’s Data Set confirms \nDefendants’ logic. \nFinally, the utility of Spencer’s Data Set may be analogized to a smudged fingerprint in the \ncontext of a criminal case.  Suppose that a small section of a fingerprint is clear, but is not sizable \nenough to produce the threshold number of “points in common” that forensic technicians require \nto make a definitive match.  If the determinative inquiry is whether the latent print matches the \ndefendant, it is true that the prosecution cannot properly use this fingerprint to meet its burden.  It \nis simultaneously true, however, that such an imperfect print could nonetheless have some \nimportant probative value in such a case—such as if the clearly visible whorls and arches prove \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 20 of 32 PageID# 4368\nwholly inconsistent with the defendant’s fingerprint.  This is, in essence, the role Spencer’s Data \nSet—and, in equal measure, the data in his  Initial Report—plays in this case. The data is \nunmistakably smudged, but it is clear enough to demonstrate that no cohesion exists.   \nb.  Neither exogenous elections nor reconstituted election results prove cohesion. \nPlaintiffs’ last gasp at offering some type of statistical data supporting cohesion is to point \nto Spencer’s data regarding exogenous federal elections and reconstituted election results using \nPlaintiffs’ proposed illustrative districts. (ECF No. 118 at 18).  This is a particularly feeble \nargument, and the cases Plaintiffs cite demonstrate why this data does not prove cohesion. \nPlaintiffs cite one case from the Fourth Circuit to support their assertion that exogenous \nelections can help them satisfy their Prong 2 burden, Cane v. Worcester County, 840 F. Supp. 1081 \n(Dist. M.D 1994).  Indeed, Cane represents the quintessential situation where courts consider \nexogenous elections to assist their inquiry.  First, there was an insufficient number of endogenous \nelections: there were only three total endogenous elections involving the minority group at issue \nand in one of those, there was evidence that the minority candidate “did not attempt to win the \nelection, making an analysis meaningless.”   \nThe court, therefore, had to look elsewhere to conduct its evaluation. Here, there are more \nthan a dozen endogenous elections involving minority candidates.7  Second, both the endogenous \nand exogenous elections analyzed by the Cane court were partisan in nature. 840 F.Supp at 1088.  \nCouncilmanic  elections  in  Virginia  Beach  are  nonpartisan;  the  exogenous  federal  elections \nSpencer  analyzes  are  partisan.    This  is  a  crucial  qualitative  difference.    Finally,  for  both \nendogenous and exogenous elections considered by the Cane court, it was possible to estimate the \n \n7 It is also worth noting that Spencer analyzed seventeen (17) endogenous elections between 2008 \nand 2018 in his Initial Report; yet, there were twenty-seven (27) competitive (i.e. including at least \ntwo candidates) endogenous elections during this same time period in Virginia Beach. Plaintiffs \nhave not even attempted to analyze these remaining ten (10) endogenous elections.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 21 of 32 PageID# 4369\nlevel of support of the minority group in question—African Americans.  Stated differently, the \nCane court supplemented its analysis of only two endogenous elections with the relevant data point \nfrom numerous exogenous elections.  To the extent Plaintiffs  claim the data from endogenous \nelections is “unreliable” and in need of supplementation, that data is unreliable not because of the \ntotal number of elections analyzed (as in Cane), but because it is not possible to reliably isolate \nestimated voting support levels for Hispanic and Asian voters in Virginia Beach.  The obvious \nflaw with Plaintiffs’ effort here is that Spencer’s data for exogenous elections also does not isolate \nestimated Asian and Hispanic voting support levels—only those for white and non-white voters. \n(Ex. 4 at 30). \nIn the best of cases, the value of exogenous elections is limited. NAACP v. City of \nThomasville, 401 F. Supp. 2d 489, n.4 (M.D.N.C. 2005) (holding, “while black-white exogenous \nelections may have some limited evidentiary value,” election results informed by partisan voting \npatterns “add[] little to the court’s analysis.”)  The present scenario is the worst of cases, however.  \nThe four cherry-picked federal elections offered by Plaintiffs do not provide evidence of cohesion \nbetween Black, Asian, and Hispanic voters and therefore cannot overcome Plaintiffs’ endogenous \nevidence that no cohesion exists.  \nPlaintiffs’ newfound reliance upon reconstituted elections to prove cohesion is even less \nefficacious.  The first case Plaintiffs cite in support of their use of reconstituted elections is Johnson \nv. Miller; but the Johnson court did not use reconstituted elections to evaluate cohesion. See 864 \nF. Supp. 1354, 1391 (S.D. Ga. 1994).  Another court opinion Plaintiffs cite noted “the court is well \naware of the decreased probative value of reconstituted elections.” Hall v. Louisiana, 108 F. Supp. \n3d 419, 436 (M.D. La. 2015). \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 22 of 32 PageID# 4370\nImportantly, Spencer himself did not present his analysis of reconstituted elections as \nevidence of cohesion.  Spencer’s introduction to his Analysis of Alternative Districts explains, “I \nhave been asked to evaluate the potential ameliorative effects of two possible voting districts.” \n(Ex. 4 at 32).  He further stated, “The question is whether minority voters in Virginia Beach will \nbe more able to elect candidates of their choice” in the illustrative districts. (Ex. 4 at 32).  Stated \ndifferently, this is an analysis of the efficacy of Plaintiffs’ proposed remedy, not of cohesion. \nMoreover, following a now familiar pattern, Spencer’s ensuing analysis actually makes \nthings worse for Plaintiffs.  Spencer unequivocally states that minority preferred candidates will \nfare better in the two proposed districts, “because voting in these districts is less likely to be racially \npolarized” and because minority candidates “are more likely to benefit from cross-over support \nfrom white voters.” (Ex. 4 at 32).  Spencer elaborates on this point, stating that with two exceptions, \n“the election preferences of white and minority voters is [sic] statistically indistinguishable or not \nsubstantively significant for all other hypothetical elections in both proposed districts.” (Ex. 4 at \n33 (emphasis added)).  Given their own expert’s conclusion that whites and minority voter \npreferences are “indistinguishable” and the relatively low numbers of Asians and Hispanic voters \nin these two districts—19% combined and 11% combined, respectively—it boggles the mind that \nPlaintiffs contend “[i]f HBA voters do not vote together in elections, they would not be able to \nregularly elect candidates of choice in Plaintiffs’ illustrative districts…” (ECF No. 118 at 21).  \nCandidates of someone’s choice would be elected in those districts, to be sure, but Spencer’s \nreconstituted data provides no indication that those candidates would be the choice of either or \nboth Hispanic and Asian voters. \nc.  Plaintiffs’ weak offering of qualitative evidence is insufficient to create a \ntriable issue  \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 23 of 32 PageID# 4371\nPlaintiffs  correctly  state  that  courts  may  consider  qualitative  evidence  of  cohesion.  \nPlaintiffs efforts in this regard, however, are insufficient to prove cohesion for two reasons.  The \nfirst is the dearth of evidence Plaintiffs can point to that supports their claim.  The holding of \nCampos, which Plaintiffs cite, is that “plaintiffs must prove that the minorities so identified \nactually vote together.” 840 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1988) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs evidence \ndoes no more than suggest that someone, somewhere, thinks of these groups vote together.  That \nwill not suffice to meet their evidentiary burden.  The second reason that qualitative evidence does \nnot help Plaintiffs meet their burden is that, although such evidence may complement or reinforce \nquantitative  evidence,  there  is  no  precedent  for  any  court  allowing  qualitative  evidence  to \novercome Plaintiffs’ own quantitative evidence that demonstrates a lack of cohesion. \nNo member of the Hispanic or Asian community is a plaintiff in this case, and Plaintiffs \nproffer only paltry evidence to support their theory of cohesion among all three minority groups \nat issue.  Plaintiffs’ assertion, for instance, that the City’s “Minority Business Council (MBC) \nworks to support ‘minority business owners’ without limiting that support to any particular group” \ndoes nothing to prove cohesion amongst Black, Asian, and Hispanic voters. (ECF No. 118 at 24).  \nPlaintiffs likewise do not advance their claim of cohesion by simply pointing out that two \ncouncilmembers “speak about minorities in Virginia Beach as a group with group-specific needs \nand priorities.” (ECF No. 118 at 24).  Plaintiffs cite Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Representation v. \nCity of Bridgeport, 26 F.3d 271, 276 (2d Cir. 1994), as supporting their claim that “[o]ther courts \nhave considered the impressions of elected officials…” (ECF No. 118 at 24).  True enough, but \nthe language of the Bridgeport opinion indicates that the elected officials in that case did much \nmore than “speak about minorities . . .as a group.”  The Bridgeport court explained that “the \nCoalition presented both testimonial and statistical evidence that African Americans and Hispanics \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 24 of 32 PageID# 4372\nin Bridgeport are politically cohesive and that voting in the City is remarkably racially polarized.” \n26 F.3d at 276.  In addition to compelling statistical evidencing supporting the Bridgeport \nplaintiff’s claims, “Americo Santiago, a state representative from Bridgeport, testified, based on \nhis observations of past city elections and personal contacts with minority citizens, that both the \nLatino and African American communities are politically cohesive.” Id.  Plaintiffs have not \nidentified a single elected official in Virginia Beach who will testify that Black, Asian, and \nHispanic voters in Virginia Beach are politically cohesive. \nThe only specific instance Plaintiffs identify wherein “HBA communities have acted as a \nunified coalition in Virginia Beach” is Plaintiff Georgia Allen’s claim, set forth in her declaration, \nthat in 2001 a group called “Community Coalition for a Better Virginia Beach,” advocated for \nsingle-member districts.  Once again, the case Plaintiffs themselves cite to in support of their \nreliance on such evidence provides a stark contrast with the case bar.  In Arbor Hill Concerned \nCitizens Neighborhood Ass’n. v. County of Albany, the Court summarized the qualitative evidence \nbefore it: \nAccording to these witnesses, blacks and Hispanics have jointly participated in \nand supported various events and projects of interest to one or the other group, \nincluding festivals, Puerto Rican rights and youth sports. They also jointly publish \na bilingual community newspaper. Anecdotal evidence has also been offered of \npast instances where blacks and Hispanics joined to support candidates preferred \nby one group or the other. Defendants have not rebutted or refuted this evidence \nnor offered any contradictory evidence. \n \n2003  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  11386,  *29-30  (N.D.N.Y.  2003)  (citations  omitted).    This  passage \nexemplifies what types of qualitative evidence actually support cohesiveness.  The Plaintiffs have \nno such similar evidence. \n  The claims made by Plaintiff Allen in her declaration also must be considered in light of \nher deposition testimony. See generally Exhibit 10, Deposition Testimony of Georgia Allen \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 25 of 32 PageID# 4373\n(attached hereto and incorporated by reference).   Allen presided over the Virginia Beach Chapter \nof the NAACP for approximately ten years and is a former candidate for both Virginia Beach City \nCouncil and state delegate. Given her political and community involvement, one might suspect \nthat she would have personal experience with other members of the alleged Black-Asian-Hispanic \ncoalition.  However, Allen testified to the following facts: \n•  As candidate for City Council, she could not recall receiving the \nendorsement of any Hispanic or Asian community groups (Ex. 10 at \n90); \n \n•  She did not campaign at any Asian-American places of worship, \nthough she did campaign at African American places of worship \n(Ex. 10 at 91-92); \n \n•  She  did  not  campaign  at  Hispanic  civic  leagues,  churches,  or \ncommunity groups (Ex. 10 at 93); \n \n•  There were no Asian or Hispanic members of her campaign team \n(Ex. 10 at 93-94); \n \n•  As a candidate for delegate, she did not receive any endorsements \nfrom the Asian or Hispanic community, though she believes she was \nthe candidate-of-choice of the African American community (Ex. \n10 at 94); \n \n•  The only Asian-community groups she could recall was “Fil-Am,” \nthough she wasn’t sure that was the name of the group in question \n(Ex. 10 at 97); \n \n•  When  asked,  she  could  not  identify  any  leaders  of  the  Asian-\nAmerican or Hispanic-American communities (Ex. 10 at 98); and \n \n•  The only Hispanic community group that she could recall was \n“Hispanic Dialogue,” though she could not be sure “if that’s in \nexistence” (Ex. 10 at 98). \n \nPlaintiffs cite the other Plaintiff, Latasha Holloway, as providing deposition testimony that \n“‘all black and brown individuals’ including Hispanic, Black, and Asian persons are affected by \nbreakdowns resulting from a deficit of representation.” (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 19 at 25).  But Ms. \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 26 of 32 PageID# 4374\nHolloway also testified that she had not had any involvement with Asian or Hispanic American \ngroups, (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 19 at 33), and that she was unaware of any support for this lawsuit from \nthe Asian or Hispanic communities. (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 19 at 30).  Neither Plaintiff’s testimony \nprovides evidence of cohesion. \nThe Plaintiffs take poetic license in asserting that their qualitative evidence “bolsters \nPlaintiffs’ claims of minority cohesion.” (ECF No. 118 at 26).  There simply is no evidence to \n“bolster”—as  the  quantitative  evidence  strongly  indicates  that  cohesion  does  not  exist.  \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs fail to proffer one iota of qualitative evidence proving that Blacks, Asians, \nand Hispanics “actually vote together.”  So while the Court may consider Plaintiffs proffer, the \nevidence offered  can not serve as a basis for finding cohesion  in  spite of the quantitative \nevidence—produced by Plaintiffs—to the contrary. \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ Evidence Shows That Whites in Virginia Beach Do Not Vote \nSufficiently as a Bloc Usually to Defeat the Preferred Candidates of the \nAlleged Minority Group \n \nAs Defendants contend in their Memorandum in Support, the lack of cohesion amongst \nBlack, Hispanic, and Asian voters not only renders moot the Gingles Prong 3 inquiry, it makes it \nimpossible to conduct such an inquiry in a meaningful way.  To whatever degree the Court is \nwilling, however, to undertake the Zen riddle of evaluating the success of the preferred candidates \nof a minority coalition that does not exist, the arguments set forth in Plaintiffs’ Response Brief \nonly confirm that Plaintiffs cannot meet their Prong 3 burden. \na.  Plaintiffs offer no evidence that the 2018 election represents a “special \ncircumstance” that renders that election non-probative. \n \nThe 2018 election of two African Americans, Sabrina Wooten and Aaron Rouse, represents \na huge challenge for the Plaintiffs, making it even more fanciful for them to assert that the White \nmajority votes sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the preferred candidates of the alleged \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 27 of 32 PageID# 4375\nminority group.  But although Plaintiffs are correct in asserting that a “special circumstances” \ndoctrine exists in case law, they fail to point to evidence that supports the conclusion that the \ndoctrine is properly applied to the 2018 election. \nOnce again, a case cited by the Plaintiffs serves as the best argument as to why their \nassertion holds no currency.  In Collins v. City of Norfolk, the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit found that the 1984 election of a minority candidate, during the pendency of the \nlawsuit (in its current iteration), “was due to the special circumstances arising out of events \nassociated with the pendency of this action.” 883 F.2d 1232, 1242 (1989).  The Collins court found \na causal connection between the lawsuit and this unusual election of a second Black councilman \nbecause the mayor not only had “[f]or the first time…supported a second black candidate,” but \nalso publicly “suggested that this suit could be mooted” should that candidate prevail. Id. at 1241-\n42.  The “unique” conduct of a group closely affiliated with the mayor also led to the court’s \nfinding that circumstances surrounding the Collins suit caused the unusual election result.  There \nwas no question that the mayor and others knew about that lawsuit, which was filed more than a \nyear before the 1984 Norfolk City Council election. Collins v. City of Norfolk, 2:83-cv-00526-\nMSD-TEM (filed Aug. 12, 1983).  \nThe circumstances surrounding the 2018 Virginia Beach City Council election are not at \nall similar to those present in Collins.  The election in question took place on November 6, 2018—\nthe week before the Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint. At the time of the election, Plaintiff \nHolloway, acting pro se, had twice moved to stay the litigation, moved for leave to file an \nAmended Complaint, repeatedly requested appointment of counsel because she claimed she was \nsuffering from a disability and required assistance of counsel to properly litigate this matter and \nDefendant City of Virginia Beach had filed a motion to dismiss the pro se Complaint pursuant to \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 28 of 32 PageID# 4376\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (See ECF Nos. 2, 13, 14, 18, 24, 28, 33, and 41).  Given the circumstances \nthat existed on the date of the election, there is no reason to believe that this lawsuit had any impact \nwhatsoever on the election results.  In deposition questioning and in other discovery, Plaintiffs \nconducted an extensive fishing expedition designed to find facts that would support application of \nthe special circumstances doctrine to this case. Plaintiffs came up with nothing on their hooks. \nPlaintiffs’ intimation of a grand conspiracy to elect minority members to City Council \nmanages the special trick of being both entirely threadbare and deeply insulting.  Plaintiffs \nproduced no evidence that any Councilmembers, City leaders, or politically influential citizens \nknew much, if anything, of the suit, which existed only in an embryonic (and stalled) stage.  \nPlaintiffs do not compellingly fill the yawning gaps in their evidence with references such as this: \n“Councilwoman [Rosemary] Wilson not only endorsed Ms. Wooten but also donated to her \ncampaign.” (ECF No. 118. at 30).  Apparently, this is an accusation.  If not, it is unclear how this \nfact has any bearing in this case.  Plaintiffs offer more apparently sinister detail: Wilson apparently \n“introduced Ms. Wooten to many of her top donors and helped her solicit those donations, attended \nher events, and lent her other support and advice.” (ECF No. at 30). \nThe evidence that the election of Mr. Rouse’s election constituted special circumstances \nincludes his three-year career as a professional football player and receiving endorsements from \nthe Virginia Governor and U.S. Senator Mark Warner. (ECF No. at 30).  Plaintiffs cite not one \ncase that supports a finding that the circumstances surrounding the democratic election of either \nCouncilmembers Rouse or Wooten constitute “special circumstances.”  \nb.  Even granting to Plaintiffs a host of generous assumptions, their expert’s \nconclusions defeat Plaintiffs’ ability to demonstrate their Prong 3 burden. \n \nFor obvious reasons, Plaintiffs wish to disavow Spencer’s Table 1, even though their own \nexpert produced it.  As discussed in Defendants Memorandum in Support, Spencer admitted in \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 29 of 32 PageID# 4377\ndeposition that he could only support the identification of seven (7) candidates as being minority \npreferred—four (4) of whom won. To put it mildly, this is an inconvenient truth for Plaintiffs. \nIn response to the disaster of Table 1, Plaintiffs attempt to run back to the shelter of \nSpencer’s Initial Report.  No sanctuary is to be found there, however.  It must first be noted that \nPlaintiffs committed flagrant errors in their summary of the Initial Report’s findings. Plaintiffs \nclaim that of 17 City Council elections analyzed, “In 10 of those elections, Spencer identified a \nminority-preferred candidate.  Unsurprisingly, of the 10 candidates, only three won elections.” \n(ECF No. at 31).  That is not even in the ballpark of Spencer’s actual findings. Spencer produced \nseven (7) charts labeled “All Probative Races” in his Initial Report. (Ex. 4 at 14, 16, 19, 21, 23, 27 \nand 29).  These charts cover 7 election cycles that involved 17 seats. Including Spencer’s \ndeposition testimony that he should have marked Ben Davenport as the All Minority preferred \ncandidate in the 2014 at-large election, Spencer identifies 16 candidates as being All Minority \npreferred.8  Eight of these 16 candidates won election.9  That result is not hard to tally, and it may \nbe that Plaintiffs momentarily forgot that the relevant inquiry is the success of minority-preferred \ncandidates and not only of minority candidates.10 See, e.g., Mallory v. Ohio, 173 F.3d 377, 383 \n(6th Cir. 1999) (citing Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 51 (1986)). \nDefendants make the following claims regarding to how Prong 3 is tallied: (1) The entire \nProng 3 inquiry is an exercise in folly because of Plaintiffs’ failure to offer competent evidence of \n \n8 Spencer indicated with checkmarks that both Jackson and Flores were minority candidates-of-\nchoice for the 2008 Kempsville race—a single seat election. During his deposition testimony, \nwhen Spencer was asked, “Can you have more than one minority candidate of choice for a single \nseat election?” he answered, “No, you cannot.” (Ex. 6 at 105:4-6.) At most, this single-seat election \ncan yield only one All Minority candidate of choice. \n9 Spencer identified these 8 winning candidates as preferred by All Minority voters: Rouse (2018); \nWooten (2018); Sessoms (2016); Davenport (2014); Henley (2014), Ross-Hammond (2012); \nBellitto (2010); and Jones (2010). \n10 See also Ex. 9 (Plaintiffs’ discovery responses identifying minority preferred candidates). \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 30 of 32 PageID# 4378\ncohesion among Black, Asian, and Hispanic voters; (2) Setting aside the first assertion, Plaintiffs \nhave not offered a defensible method of identifying minority-preferred candidates; (3) For any \nanalysis of minority candidates of choice and probative elections, the probative period should be \nfrom 2011 (after the most recent redistricting) through the most recent election in 2018; and (4) \nEven ignoring (3), adopting Plaintiffs’ preferred time span, the All Probative Races analysis in \nSpencer’s Initial Report, reveals that 8 minority candidates of choice prevail in 16 opportunities, \nand using Table 1 of Spencer’s Rebuttal Report, 4 minority candidates of choice prevail out of 7 \nopportunities (both as amended by Spencer’s deposition testimony).  Again, applying simple math, \nin neither analysis is the minority candidate of choice “usually” defeated, whether by white bloc \nvoting or otherwise.  Those “best case” tallies are grounds for summary judgment in Defendants’ \nfavor on Prong 3.  See Lewis v. Alamance Cty., 99 F.3d 600, 606 (4th Cir. 1996). \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Fail in Their Attempt to Manufacture a “Battle of the Experts.” \nAt numerous points in Plaintiffs’ Brief in Support, they attempt to manufacture a “battle of \nthe experts” by focusing on Defendants’ experts.  The motive behind this strategy is transparent, \nbut Plaintiff’s efforts to tarnish Defendants’ experts is wholly irrelevant to Defendants’ summary \njudgment motion, which is based solely on Plaintiffs’ own evidence. \nIn presenting the undisputed fact and arguments upon which they rely for summary \njudgment, Defendants rely solely on the remarkably self-defeating evidence offered by Plaintiffs’ \nown experts, and in particular: Spencer’s 7 “All Probative Races” charts, found in his Initial \nReport; Spencer’s Rebuttal Report Table 1 and its underlying Data Set; and the deposition \ntestimony of Plaintiffs’ experts Spencer and (to a lesser degree) Lichtman.  Defendants contend \nthat an objective analysis of this evidence, produced by the Plaintiffs alone, makes it abundantly \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 121   Filed 11/15/19   Page 31 of 32 PageID# 4379\nclear that Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden with regard to either or both Gingles Prongs 2 and 3.  \nDefendants support this argument by relying upon simple math and irrefutable logic.  \nDefendants’ case for summary judgment simply does not rely upon a single fact or opinion \npromulgated by Defendants’ experts, and accordingly, Plaintiffs’ reference to them in their \nResponse Brief is at best a distraction.

Ct. 2752(1986), the Supreme Court\ninterpreted the statutory language and legislative history ofSection 2 and\nset forth the essential elements ofa Section 2 minority vote dilution claim. In\nreaching its decision the Court unanimously affirmed the decision of a three-\njudge District Court in North Carolina, Gineles v. Edmisten. 590 F. Supp. 345\n(E.D.N.-C. 1984), holdinginvalid under Section 2fordilution ofblackvoting\nstrength at-large votingin multimemberstate legislative districts. The\nSupreme Court struck down four ofthe five districts involved in the appeal\ndespite facts showingthatblack candidates had been electedin allofthe\ncontested districts, that there were substantiallevels ofwhite cross-overvoting\nfor black candidates, and that the state had made special efforts in recent\nyears to close the gap betweenwhite and black voter registration rates (106\nS.Ct. at 2761-62, 2771, 2782-83: 590 F. Supp. At 361).\n(1) The section 2LegalStandard: WhetherMinorityVoters Have Less\nOpportunityTo Elect RepresentativesofTheir Choice.\nUnder Gingles, the essential questionin a Section 2case is whether under\nthe challenged electoral system minority voters have less opportunitythan\nwhite votes toelectcandidates oftheirchoice. As the Supreme Court held:\nThe essence ofa §2claim is that a certain electorallaw, practice or structure\ninteracts with social and historicalconditionsto cause an ineaualitv inthe\nopportunities eniovedbv black andwhite voters to electtheirpreferred\nrepresentatives.\n106 S Ct. at 2764-65 (emphasis added). The Court explained that the\ntheoretical basis for challengingimpairmentof minority votingstrength in at-\nlargevoting schemes in that\"where minorityand majorityvotersconsistently\nprefer differentcandidates, the majority, by virtue ofits numerical superiority,\nwill regularly defeat the choices of minority voters.\" Id. at 2765.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 40   Filed 07/27/18   Page 13 of 31 PageID# 230\nASection 2violation is established when these factors are present.\nStatedsuccinctly, a blocvoting majority must usually be able to defeat\ncandidates supported bya politicallycohesive,geogi'aphicallyinsular minority\ngroup.\nId. at 2766. The Court then analyzed each ofthe elements ofa validclaim of\nminority vote dilution under the statue:\nFirst, the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently\nlarge and geographicallycompact to constitute a majority in a single-member\ndistrict.\nSecond, the minority group must be able to show that itis politically cohesive.\nThird, the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority\nvotes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it-in the absence ofspecialcircumstances,\nsuch as the minority candidate running unopposed, ...usually to defeat the\nminority's preferred candidate.\nFinally, we observe that the usual predictability ofthe majority's success\ndistinguishes structural dilutionform the mere loss ofan occasional election.\nId. at 2766-67. Under this \"functional\" approach, the otherevidentiary factors\nset forth in the Senate Judiciary Committee report take on a more peripheral\nrole'\n[T]hemost importantSenate Report factors bearingon §2 challenges to\nmultimember districts are the \"extent to which minority group members have\nbeenelected to public office in the jurisdiction\" and the \"extent to which voting\nin the elections ofthe state orpoliticalsubdivisionis racially polarized .\"[S. Rep.\nNo.97-417 at] 28*29, U.S. CodeCong. &Admin. News 1982,p. 206. Ifpresent,\nthe other factors, such as the lingering effects ofpast discrimination, the use of\nappeals to racial bias in election campaigns, and the use ofelectoraldevices\nwhich enhance the dilutive effects ofmultimemberdistricts when substantial\nwhite blocvotingexists-for example antibullet votinglaws and majority vote\nrequirements, are supportive of, but not essential to. a minority voter's claim. Id.\nat 2766 n. 15 (emphasis in original).\n(2) The Legal Standardfor ProvingRacially PolarizedVoting Is Met when the\nProofShows that White and Black Voters Vote Differently and Minority-\nSupported CandidatesAre Defeated by White BlocVoting.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 40   Filed 07/27/18   Page 14 of 31 PageID# 231\nThe Court defined the key element ofracially polarized voting as a\nconsistent relationship between [the]raceofthe voterand the wayin which\nthe voter votes,'...or to put it differently, where 'black voters and white voters\nvote differently.'\" at 2768 n. 21. Noting that the extent ofracial blocvoting\nnecessary to show that minorities have unequal opportunities to elect their\npreferred representatives depends upon \"several factual circumstance\" and\n\"willvaryfi:omdistrict to district.\" the Courtsetforth two standards for\nmeasuring\"legally significant\" racial blocvoting. The first is the measure of\nthe \"politicalcohesiveness\" ofminority voters based on a \"showing that a\nsignificant numberofminority group members usually vote for the same\ncandidates\" (id.at 2769). Second, \"a white blocvote that normally will defeat\nthe combined strength ofminority support pluswhite 'crossover' votes rises to\nthe leveloflegally significantwhite bloc voting\" ^ at 2770).\nBecausea pattern ofracial blocvoting\"over a period oftime\" is \"more\nprobative\" ofa violation, where a pattern ofpolarization has been shown \"the\nfact thatracially polarizedvotingis not present in one or a few individual\nelections does not necessarily negate the conclusion that the district experi\nences legally significantblocvoting\" (id.). For the same reason, \"the success\nofa minoritycandidate in a particularelection does not necessarily prove that\nthe district did not experience polarizedvotingin thatelection.\"special\ncircumstances, such as the absence ofanopponent, incumbency, or the\nutilization ofbullet voting, may explain minority electoralsuccess in a\npolarized contest\" (id., footnotes omitted).\nFurther, in a ruling that is particularly applicable here, the Court rejected\narguments by the defendants and the Solicitor (General that proofofracially\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 40   Filed 07/27/18   Page 15 of 31 PageID# 232\npolarizedvoting must include more than simply a showing ofa correlation\nbetween the race ofthe voters and votingfor candidates. Defendants and the\nSolicitorGeneral argued that proofofracial blocvoting must include proofthat\nrace is the primary determinant ofthe voters' choices and not othervariables\nwhich mightinfluencevoting, such as party affiliation, age, religion, income,\nincumbency, education, campaign expenditures, and the like. In rejecting this\nargument, the Court held:\nForpurposes of§ 2, the legal concept ofracially polarized voting\nincorporates neithercausation nor intent. It means simply that the race of\nvoters correlates with the electionofa certain candidatesor candidates; thatis,\nit refers to the situation where different races (or minority language groups) vote\nin blocs for different candidates.\nId. at 2773. The Courtreasoned that because Section 2 prohibits voting\nsystems which impair minorities' ability to electcandidates oftheirchoice\nwhen whites and minorities vote for different candidates, itis the difference\nbetween the choices made by white and minority voters that is relevant under\nSection 2 and the reasonsfor these differences are irrelevant (id.)\nFurther, the Court noted the practical difficulty ofseparating out race from\nothersocioeconomicvariables which might influence voting, such as income,\neducation, employment, housing, and the like, because race andsocioeconomic\ncharacteristics \"are often closelycorrelated,\" frequently because ofpast or\npresent discrimination against the minority group (i^ at 2773-75).\nFinally, the Court recognized that the goal ofCongress in enactingthe 1982\namendment toSection 2 was to eliminate the necessityofproving\ndiscriminatory intent.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 40   Filed 07/27/18   Page 16 of 31 PageID# 233\nTorequire proofthat white voters bloc voteagainst minority supported\ncandidates becauseofrace orfrom racial hostility\"wouldfrustrate the goals\nCongress sought to achieve by repudiating the intent test...\" (i^ at 2777).\n*Only four justices (Justices O'Connor,Powell,Rehnquist, and ChiefJustice\nBurger) dissented from PartIII-Cofthe Court's opinionin whichthe Court\nrejected the defense argument that the elements ofcausation or intent were\nrelevant to the Section 2inquiry intovoting patterns. Justice White, in his\nseparate concurrence, disagreed with this section ofJustice Brennan's opinion\nfor the Courtonly on the narrow issue ofthe\n(3) The Election ofSome Black Candidates Does Not Foreclose a Section 2\nClaim.\nThe Court also rejected the defense argument that the electoral success of\nblack candidates in the challenged districts demonstrated conclusively that\nblack voters were not denied an equalopportunity to electcandidates oftheir\nchoice (id at 2779-80). The statue itselfstates that this factor \"is one\ncircumstance which maybe considered,\" and, the Court noted, the Senate\nreport expressly states that \"the election ofa few minority candidates does not\n'necessarilyforeclosethe possibilityofdilution ofthe black vote' \"(id.). From\nthis the Court concluded:\nThus, the language of§2 and its legislative history plainly demonstrate that\nproofthat some minority candidates have been elected does not foreclose a § 2\nclaim. Id\nWith regard to one district, however, the Court concluded that the fact that\nblackvotersin House District 23 had enjoyed\nRelevance ofthe race ofthe candidates in determining racially polarizedvoting\n(id. at 2783*84). Moreover, Justice O'Connor agreed with Justice Brennan that\nproofthat divergent racial votingpatterns were caused by factors other than\nrace should notbe partofthe proofofracially polarizedvoting^\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 40   Filed 07/27/18   Page 17 of 31 PageID# 234\nIn sofar as statisticalevidenceofdivergent racial voting patterns is admitted\nsolely to establish that the minority group is politically cohesive and to assess its\nprospects for electoral success, I agree with the plurality that defendants cannot\nrebut this showingbyofferingevidencethat the divergent racial voting patterns\nmay beexplainedin partby causes other than race, such as an underlying\ndivergence in the interests ofminority and white voters. Id. at 2792. Four\njustices were ofthe opinion, however, that such evidence was relevant to \"the\noverallvote dilution inquiry.\"\nproportional representation consistently since 1973, coupledwith the failure of\nthe plaintiffs to offer any demonstration that such sustainedsuccess did not\naccurately reflect the minority group's ability to elect its preferred\nrepresentatives, required reversal ofthe District Court's ruling with respect to\nthatdistrict. Id. at 2779.\nH. The Fourth Circuit's Decision.\nTheFourth Circuit applied the legal standards setforth in Gingles to hold\nthat this Court in its prior decision erred as a matteroflaw (l) in accepting\ndefendants' definition ofracially polarized voting which requires proofof\n\"white backlash\" and\"whether whites attempt to limitthe field ofcandidates\"\n(816F.2d at 935*37): (2)in rulingthat the degree ofminority electoralsuccess\nin Norfolkprecludes a Section 2claim (id.at 937-38): (3)in adopting an \"overly\nrestrictive\" definition of\"a candidates slatingprocess\" (id. at 938*39)and\n(4)in requiring proofofdiscriminatory intent to show white officials'\nunresponsiveness to minority needs. The Fourth Circuit also indicated that\nincreases in black voter registration and turnout in Norfolk were not\ndispositive ofblackelectoralparticipation (id.at 939).\nI. Raciallv polarized voting. The Fourth Circuit held that underGineles:\nThelegal standard for the existence ofracially polarized voting looks only to\nthe difference between how majority votes and minority votes were cast: itdoes\nnot ask why those votes were castthe way they were nor whether there were\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 40   Filed 07/27/18   Page 18 of 31 PageID# 235\notherfactors present in contestedelections, such as \"white backlash.\" Id.\nOn remand, the court ruled, \"the court should pursue the question solely\nthrough the analysis ofvoting patterns, withoutseeking to explain why those\npatterns.\" exist.\" Id. at 936. The District Court also should reexamine its\nrejectionofplaintife' studies ofvoting patterns due to methodological problems\nand accept them \"unless their methodological flaws were so severe as to render\nthem irrelevantor totally misleading.\" M\nJ.

P. 62, filed on July 7, 2021. ECF No. 262. On July 8, 2021, Plaintiffs responded without\nopposition and Defendants replied. ECF Nos. 263, 264. Having reviewed the motion and filings,\nthis Court finds that a hearing is not necessary to address this motion. For the reasons set forth\nbelow, Defendants' Motion is DENIED.\nI.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn March 31, 2021, the Court entered a judgment declaring the City of Virginia Beach's\nat-large method of election illegal. ECF No. 242. Pursuant to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the\nCourt further enjoined use of the at-large system of election, ordered that the City shall not adopt\nany system of election for members of its City Council that does not comply with § 2 of the Voting\nRights Act, and ordered that the City of Virginia Beach shall not implement or utilize any practice,\npolicy, procedure or other action that results in the dilution of minority participation in the\nelectoral process.

On May 12, 2021, the\nCourt ordered the parties to submit proposed remedial plans by July 1, 2021 to redress the at-large\n1\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 2 of 22 PageID# 9293\nsystem of election for the City of Virginia Beach. ECF No. 252. On June 3,2021, Plaintiffs filed a\nmotion to Modify the Remedial Briefing Schedule and Defendants responded. ECF Nos. 256,257,\n258. On July 1,2021, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to modify the remedial briefing schedule\nand ordered the parties to file their proposed remedial proposed plans, responses, and replies, all\ndue by July 30,2021. ECF No. 259.\nMeanwhile, on June 3, 2021, Plaintiffs (Appellees) filed a Motion with the Fourth Circuit to\nSuspend Briefing and Hold the Case in Abeyance pending remedial proceedings in the district\ncourt. See No. 21-1533 Dkt. No 11. In response, on June 15,2021, Defendants (Appellants)f iled a\nmotion in opposition to abeyance pending remedial proceedings in the district court and a\ncross-motion to advance the briefing and expedite the appeal on the District Court's memorandum\nand opinion, ECF No. 242, which found the City in violation oft he Voting Rights Act. Id. at Dkt.\nNo. 24.\nThen, on July 2, 2021, Virginia Beach Councilmember Jessica Abbott aimoimced her\nresignation fi-om the Virginia Beach City Council, effective immediately, for health concems. Ms.\nAbbott represented the Kempsville residency district. See ECF No. 262. Accordingly, on July 7,\n2021, Defendants (Appellants) filed a letter informing the Fourth Circuit about Ms. Abbott's\nresignation and arguing that the Plaintiffs (Appellees) Motion to hold the case in abeyance be\ndenied because it would irreparably harm the City and the Motion \"no longer has any conceivable\nmerit( if it ever did...).\" See ECF No. 263 at Exhibit 1; see also, No. 21-1533 Dkt.

No. 11, as well\nas denied Defendants' (Appellants) motion to expediate review of the district  court's\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 3 of 22 PageID# 9294\nmemorandum and opinion and order, Dkt. No. 24. Id. at Dkt. No. 29. Accordingly, the Defendants\nrequest that the Court lift the permanent injunction.\nII.  LEGAL STANDARD\nA district court is authorized to suspend or grant equitable relief during the pendency of an\nappeal by Rule 62(c), F.R.Civ.P.:\nWhen an appeal is taken from an interlocutory or final judgment granting,\ndissolving, or denying an injunction, the court in its discretion may suspend,\nmodify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency oft he appeal upon such\nterms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the rights of\nthe adverse party.\nThe moving party effectively asks the court to delay the implementation of its decision until\nthe court of appeals has had an opportunity to consider the validity of that ruling. Since such an\naction interrupts the ordinary process of judicial review and postpones relief for the prevailing\nparty at trial, the stay of an equitable order is an extraordinary device which should be sparingly\ngranted.\" The factors regulating the issuance of a stay are generally the same;( 1) whether the stay\napplicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits;( 2) whether the\napplicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will\nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and( 4) where the public interest\nlies.\" Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, at 776( 1987); see also, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 62(c),\n28 U.S.C.A.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 4 of 22 PageID# 9295\nIn circumstances where a stay is requested before the district issues final judgment', and thus,\nappeal is not pending,\" [t]he District Court has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident\nto its power to control its own docket.\" Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997). In exercising\nthat discretion, a district court is instructed to \"weigh competing interests and maintain an even\nbalance.\" Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248,254( 1936)( explaining that \"the power to\nstay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the\ncauses on its docket.\"); see also, Dominion Energy, Inc. v. City of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys.,\n928 F.3d 325,335 (4th Cir. 2019). \"Proper use of this authority calls for the exercise ofj udgment\nwhich must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance.\" Williford v. Armstrong\nWorld Indus., Inc., 715 F.2d 124, 127 (4th Cir. 1983) (citation and intemal quotation marks\nomitted). To determine whether to grant a stay before final judgment, a district court should\nconsider \"(I) the length of the requested stay;( 2)t he hardship or inequity that the movant would\nface in going forward with the litigation; (3) the injury that a stay would inflict upon the\nnon-movant; and (4) whether a stay would simplify issues and promote judicial economy.\" Rajput\nV.

Supp. 3d 607, 609-10( M.D. Pa. 2016).\nAbove all, the exercise of this power is especially important \"in cases of extraordinary public\nmoment\" where a party \"may be required to submit to delay not immoderate in extent and not\noppressive  in  its  consequences  if  the  public  welfare  or  convenience will thereby\nbe promoted.\" Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, at 707 (1997) {quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 256).\n'2 8 U.S.C.A. § 1291 provides that \"the courts of appeals (other than the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit) shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United\nStates. \"Final Judgment\" rule serves several salutary purposes, such as preventing piecemeal appeals that might\notherwise undermine independence of district judge, avoiding obstruction to just claims, and promoting efficient\njudicial administration. Cunningham v. Hamilton Cty., Ohio, 527 U.S. 198 (1999). In accord with this historical\nunderstanding, the Supreme Court has repeatedly interpreted § 1291 to mean that an appeal ordinarily will not lie\nuntil after final judgment has been entered in a case. See, e.g., Quackenbush v. Alistate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706,\n712(1996); Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863,867( 1994); Richardson-Merrell Inc.\nV. Koller, 472 U.S. 424,430( 1985).\n4\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 5 of 22 PageID# 9296\nNevertheless, the burden of showing the necessity for a stay rests with the moving party and is\nheightened when a stay will \"work damage\" to another party. Landis, 299 U.S. at 255.\" The party\nseeking a stay must justify it by clear and convincing circumstances outweighing potential harm\nto the party against whom it is operative.\" Williford v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 715 F.2d 124,\n127( 4th Cir. 1983)( emphasis added).\nin.  DISCUSSION\nDefendants' argue that the Court should stay its injunction prohibiting the City of Virginia\nBeach from employing the at-large system of election so that the City may conduct a special\nelection in November 2021. In support of this argument. Defendants first contend that they have a\nsubstantial likelihood ofs uccess on appeal and they set forth their grounds for appeal.S ee ECF No.\n262 at 6-7. Second, Defendants argue that the injunction will be irreparably harmed absent a stay\nbecause the City Council will become short one member as of November 2021 and a remedial plan\n\"cannot be adopted and administered prior...\" to the November election. Id. at 8-15. Third,\nDefendants' argue that Plaintiffs would not be harmed by lifting the injunction. Id. at 15-17.\nFinally, Defendants contend that a stay would benefit the public both in the Kempsville District\nand across the City. Id. at 17-20.\nIn response. Plaintiffs do not oppose modifying the Court's injunction to allow the special\nelection for the Kempsville residency district. ECF No. 263. Notably, the Plaintiffs assert that the\nresults of a special election for the Kempsville district is unlikely \"...to harm Plaintiffs' remedial\nrights.\" Id. at 2. However, Plaintiffs contend that if the elected candidate in the November 2021\nKempsville special election resides in the area of the district that contains a majority of the\nMinority population, then \"... it is likely that this Court's remedial plan will be affected by the\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 6 of 22 PageID# 9297\nspecial election.\" Id. at 4( emphasis in original).^ Moreover, Plaintiffs state that they reserve the\nright to \"seek an order from this Court truncating the term of the candidate elected in the\nNovember 2021 special election in the event that the winning candidate resides in one of the\nSection 2 remedial districts ordered by the Court.\" Id. at 4.\nWhile F.R.C.P. Rule 62(c) authorizes the Court to grant the Defendants relief by lifting the\ninjunction, the decision is one within the Court's discretion. Moreover, since a stay interrupts the\ncourt's proceedings, including devising equitable remedies to issue final judgment, a stay\npostpones relief for the prevailing party. Therefore, \"the stay of an equitable order is an\nextraordinary device which should be granted sparingly.\" See United States v. State ofLa^, 815 F.\nSupp. 947,948( E.D. La. 1993); see also, Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Federal Trade Commission,3 98\nF.Supp. 1, 17 (S.D.Tex.1 975), ajfd. 546 F.2d 646 (5th Cir. 1976); see also, F.M.C. v. New York\nTerminal Conference, 373 F.2d 424,426( 2nd Cir. 1967).\nWhen an injunction serves as an equitable remedy, albeit temporarily, for constitutional\nviolations, the clear and compelling duty of the Court is to institute meaningful relief to eliminate\nthe effects of past illegality and assure future compliance with the laws of the land. Louisiana v.\nUnited States, 380 U.S. 145, at 154( \"We bear in mind that the court has not merely the power but\nthe duty to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the\npast as well as bar like discrimination in the future.\"); See e.g.. Green v. County School Board, 391\nU.S. 430, at 438, n.4 {\\9(iZy,United States v. Crescent Amusement Co.,3 23 U.S. 173; Standard Oil\nCo. V. United States, 221 U.S. 1; Griffin v. County School Board ofPrince Edward County, 377\nU.S. 218, at 232—234; Green v. Cty. Sch. Bd. ofN ew Kent Cty., Va., 391 U.S. 430, at 438( 1968).\n^Plaintiffs note that a portion of the Kempsvillc district contains 18,000 people, with a citizen voting age\npopulation (\"CVAP\") that is 45.8% Black, 9.3% Hispanic, 5.9% Asian, and 37.1% white. Accordingly, this\nportion of the district is included in the remedial districts proposed by both parties. See ECF No.2 62 at 4;s ee also,\nECF Nos. 260,261 (Remedial proposals by Defendants and Plaintiffs).\n6\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 7 of 22 PageID# 9298\nThese general precepts governing requests for interlocutory stays are underscored when relief\nhas been ordered to remedy constitutional violations, as it pertains to fundamentals rights such as\nvoting. Constitutional rights are warrants for the here and now, to be promptly fulfilled in the\nabsence of \"an overwhelming compelling reason\". Watson v. Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, at 533\n(1963). Accordingly, with these principles in mind, the Court will examine the Defendants' merits\nfor lifting the equitable injunction currently in place.\nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nFirst, the Court has already determined that Defendants are not likely to succeed on the\nmerits of the underlying case. Although Defendants claim that they will likely succeed on appeal,\nsee ECF No.2 62, Defendants' legal analysis is misguided. That is, the question before the Court is\nnot whether Defendants will succeed on appeal. Rather, the question is whether Defendants will\nsucceed on the merits of the underlying case to justify lifting the temporary injunction.\nCritically, the Court found that the at-large election system used by the City of Virginia\nBeach is unconstitutional because it dilutes the votes of Minority voters, and, thus, violates § 2(a)\nof the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\"VRA\") and the Fifteenth Amendment. See ECF No. 242.\nSpecifically, the Court found that Plaintiffs satisfied the Gingles preconditions and determined that\n\"based on the totality of the circumstances, there [was] a violation of Section 2.\" United States v.\nCharleston Cty., S.C., 365 F.3d at 345 (4th Cir. 2004); see also, ECF No. 242 at 38-132;\nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, at 44-45 (1986). Moreover, in conducting the totality of the\ncircumstance's inquiry, the Court found substantial evidence in support of each of the nine Senate\nfactors, and ultimately foimd that \"Plaintiffs [] satisfied their brnden of showing that the Minority\nCommunity has less opportunity than other members oft he electorate to participate in the political\nprocess and elect their preferred candidates.\" See id. at 94.\n7\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 8 of 22 PageID# 9299\nWhile there is an appeal pending regarding the Court's aforementioned findings set out in its\nmemorandum and opinion, see EOF Nos. 247,250, the Fourth Circuit stayed Defendants' appeal\nbecause the Court has not issued final judgment as it still must fashion remedies. See ECF No. 266;\nsee also, Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, at 521-522( 1988)( holding that a decision is\nnot final unless it \"'ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but\nexecute the judgment.'\") (quoting Ca//m v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945)); Swint v.\nChambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 42, (1995)( A \"final decisio[n]\" is typically one \"by\nwhich a district court disassociates itself from a case.\"); Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558\nU.S. 100,106( 2009)( holding the same).^\nAccordingly, the Fourth Circuit appropriately denied Defendants' motion to expedite appeal\nproceedings because the Court has not yet concluded the remedies on this matter, and, thus\nproceedings are ongoing. Therefore, the Court need not consider whether Defendants' will likely\nsucceed on appeal. See also, e.g., Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Assn. v. FPC, 104 U.S. App.D.C.\n106, at 110( 1958); Washington Metropolitan Area Comm'n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 182 U.S. App.\nD.C. 220, at 221-222( 1977).''\n^ Although, once an appeal is filed district courts are divested from jurisdiction there are situations where the\ndistrict court's are given jurisdiction to promote judicial efficiency and facilitate the division of labor between\ntrial and appellate courts. See, Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246,258-59( 4th Cir. 2014)( explaining that, after the\nfiling ofa  notice ofa ppeal, a federal district court is divested ofj urisdiction to rule on matters related to the appeal\nunless such rulings \"aid[ ]t he appellate process\"); but see, e.g., Lytle v. Griffith, 240 F.3d 404,407 n. 2( 4th\nCir.2001)( concluding that the district coiul's limited modification of an injunction appropriately \"aided in th[e]\nappeal by relieving [the court] from considering the substance of an issue begotten merely ftom imprecise\nwording in the injunction\"); Fabian v. Storage Tech. Corp., 164 F.3d 887, 890 (4th Cir.1999)( holding that a\ndistrict court is authorized, under the in aid of appeal exception, to entertain a Rule 60(b) motion after a party\nappeals the district court's judgment); Grand Jury Proceedings Under Seal, 947 F.2d at 1190 (holding that the\ndistrict court retained jurisdiction to memorialize its oral opinions soon after a decision was rendered).\nHowever, the Court notes the Judiciary Act of 1789,1 Stat. 73,\" established the general principle that only final\ndecisions of the federal district courts would he reviewable on appeal.\" Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450\nU.S. 79, at 83 (1981)( emphasis deleted). Notably, § 1292(a)(1) gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over\n\"(ijnterlocutory orders of the district courts\" \"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving\ninjunctions,\" \"except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\" Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305,\nat 2319( 2018).\n8\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 9 of 22 PageID# 9300\nTherefore, the Defendants' have failed to show that they will succeed on the merits. Without\na substantial case on the merits, Defendants' burden to demonstrate that the circumstances of this\ncase warrant a stay is practically impossible. This is because, in order to carry their burden, the\nDefendants must provide sufficient proof to show that \"the injury and harm, which would inure to\ntheir detriment as a result of the implementation of court-ordered relief, would be so\noverwhelming as to call into question the logic oft he remedial plan itself.\" United States v. State of\nLa., 815 F. Supp. 947,953( E.D. La. 1993).\nB. Irreparable Injury to the Moving Party\nSecond, the Court finds that the Defendants will not suffer irreparable injury ift he Court keeps\nthe temporary injunction until it can establish a remedial and constitutional electoral system.\nFirst, the injunction itself is an appropriate temporary measure in this case to prevent further\ninjury to the public. As noted above, case law instructs that remediation of the § 2 violation is part\nof the judgment. Congress and federal courts have recognized that the appropriate remedy for a §2\nviolation in a single-member at-large districting scheme is to redraw district lines to create one or\nmore additional districts in which minority voters can exercise electoral control. See Bash v. Vera,\n517 U.S. 952,977( 1996); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899,914-15( 1996){ Shaw //); De Grandy, 512\nU.S. at 1008. As Justice O'Connor stated in her concurring opinion in Vera,\n[Wjhere voting is racially polarized, § 2 prohibits States from adopting districting\nschemes that would have the effect that minority voters \"have less opportunity than\nother members of the electorate to ... elect representatives of their choice.\" § 2(b).\nThat principle may require a State to create a majority-minority district where the\nthree Gingles factors are present....\nVera, 517 U.S. at 993 (first alteration in original). In this case, the litigation has not ended with\nrespect to the merits of a remedy and, thus, the Court, at this stage does not have a judgment to\nexecute. Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 521-522 (1988)( quoting Ca///« v. United\n9\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 10 of 22 PageID# 9301\nSlates, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945)). A \"final decisio[n]\" is typically one \"by which a district court\ndisassociates itself fi^om a case.\" Swint v. Chambers County Comm 'n, 514 U.S. 35,42,( 1995). In\nthe instant case, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, the Court specified that \"any fixrther use of the\nat-large system of election for the Virginia Beach City Coimcil is hereby enjoined.\" See ECF No.\n242 at 132. Subsequently, on May 12,2021, the Court further elaborated by ordering the parties to\nsubmit proposed remedial plans by July 1, 2021 to redress the at-large system of election for the\nCity of Virginia Beach. ECF No. 252. See Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, at 2321 (2018)( noting\nthat the district court's \"orders are unequivocal that the current legislative plans 'violate § 2 and\nthe Fourteenth Amendment' and that these violations 'must be remedied.' Thus, the district\nCourt's language had the practical effect of enjoining further use oft he invalid legislative districts\nand, the court properly provided the state an opportunity to remedy.). On July 1, 2021, the Court\ndenied Plaintiffs' motion to modify the remedial briefing schedule and ordered the parties to file\ntheir proposed remedial proposed plans, responses, and replies, all due by July 30,2021. ECF No.\n259. Subsequently, the parties filed their respective proposed remedies on July 1,2021. ECF Nos.\n260,261.\nAbsent unusual circumstances, \"such as where an impending election is imminent and a\nState's election machinery is already in progress,\" an injunction is the appropriate temporary\nremedy\"  t o insure {sic) that no further elections are conducted imder the invalid plan.\" Reynolds v.\nSims, 377 U.S. 533, at 585 (1964). In such circumstances, the \"a court is entitled to and should\nconsider the proximity of a forthcoming election and the mechanics and complexities of state\nelection laws, and should act and rely upon general equitable principles. With respect to the timing\nofr elief, a court can reasonably endeavor to avoid a disruption oft he election process which might\nresult from requiring precipitat[ing] changes that could make unreasonable or embarrassing\n10\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 11 of 22 PageID# 9302\ndemands on a State in adjusting to the requirements of the court's decree.\" Id. The Court notes that\nthere were no special circumstances at the time the Court enjoined Defendants from using the\ninvalid at-large district system.\nHowever, the Court recognizes special circumstances may arise during the remedial\nproceedings. At the case at bar, while both parties have been participating in remedial proceedings,\nthere has been an unexpected resignation on the City Council which presents such circumstances.\nSpecifically, on July 2, 2021, Virginia Beach Councilmember Jessica Abbott announced her\nresignation from the Virginia Beach City Council, effective immediately, for health concerns. Ms.\nAbbott represented the Kempsville residency district. See ECF No.2 62. Pursuant to Virginia Law,\nthe City Coimcil must now appoint an interim, temporary successor to fill the vacant seat. Next,\nthe City is required to hold a special election \"on the date of the next general election in\nNovember,\" November 2,2021,t o fill the remainder of Ms. Abbott's unexpired term ofo ffice. Va.\nCode Ann.§  24.2-228(A). The temporary successor, by law, caimot remain in office past that date.\nId. at § 24.2-226. Moreover, pursuant to state law, the City must follow certain procedures and\ndeadlines to fill the vacancy in November 2021. See ECF No. 262 at 4-5 (outlining the timeline\nthat the City must follow starting on July 19,2021 by filing a petition to the circuit court to issue a\nwrit of election to fill the vacancy.).\nAccordingly, Defendants argue that the injunction \"would inflict irreparable harm on the City\nand the public\" primarily because it finstrates the City's application of state law goveming\n11\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 12 of 22 PageID# 9303\nelections, creates a council without a tie-breaking vote, and no alternative remedial plan would be\nin place by November 2021. ECF No. 262 at 8-15.^\nThe Court disagrees with Defendants' position and their legal analysis is, again, misguided.\nFirst, Defendants reliance on Abbott v. Perez, to argue that the Court's injunction frustrates\napplication of a state law goveming elections in the City, is inapplicable. In Abbott v. Perez, the\nSupreme Court overturned a three-judge court in the Western District ofT exas which directed the\nState of Texas not to conduct its election using districting plans the district court previously\ndeveloped for the 2012 elections, pursuant to a previous VRA case. See Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct.\nat 2313 (2018); see also. Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388,( 2012). The three-judge panel repealed the\nState-approved 2011 plans and foimd that \"they were tainted by discriminatory intent and that the\n2013 Legislature had not 'cured' that 'taint.'\" Abbott v. Perez, at 2313. The Supreme Court\novertumed the three-judge panel's repeal of the 2011 plans because the panel committed a\n\"fundamental legal error\" of shifting the burden onto the State to show that the 2013 Legislature\ndid not act with discriminatory intent when it enacted the 2011 plans, and used them in the 2012,\n2014, and 2016 elections, which the district court previously approved. Id. Therefore, the Supreme\n^ Defendants also cite to numerous cases for the proposition that \"[c]ourts have, many times, found administration\nproblems to weigh in favor of permitting an election to proceed under a challenged scheme, or even one held\nunlawful.\" However, Defendants legal analysis is, again, inapplicable because the cases they cite to are unalike to the\nfacts, proceedings, and case at bar. See ECF No. 262 at 15. For example, in Chisom v. Roemer,8 53 F.2d 1186, 1192\n(5th Cir. 1988), the Fifth Circuit vacated a preliminary injunction that the district court imposed, after a panel\nrehearing, to enjoin the electoral system in an upcoming election before making any factual or legal conclusions.\nDefendants also cite to various orders where the Supreme Court vacated a lower court's injunction. However, these\ncases are also unalike to the circumstances at bar. For example, in Gill v. Whitford, 137 S. Ct. 2289,198 L. Ed. 2d 697\n(2017), the Supreme Court stayed the District Court's injunction of a districting plan created by the State legislature\npending an appeal while the State legislature developed a remedial plan. See also, Rucho v. Common Cause, 138 S. Ct.\n923, 199 L. Ed. 2d 619( 2018)( lihing a temporary injunction pending appeal in a case where the district court had\nplaced knowing that the 2018 general election was months away in a case involving state-wide redistricting maps.);\nNorth Carolina v. Covington, 138 S. Ct. 974,200 L. Ed.2 d 216( 2018)( similar procedural background involving state\nredistricting maps where an injunction by the district court was lifted pending appeal).\n12\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 13 of 22 PageID# 9304\nCourt held that the three-judge panel's injunction of the 2011-districting plans was without merit.\nId.^\nHere, the Court has not committed a fundamental legal error of shifting the burden of proof.\nRather, after a six-day bench trial, the Coxut meticulously examined the Plaintiffs and Defendants\nevidence, proposed finds of fact and law, and found that the Plaintiffs did satisfy their burden of\nproof and demonstrated that the City of Virginia's at-large district system is unconstitutional.\nMoreover, unlike Abbott v. Perez, to-date there have not been any court- or state-approved\nredistricting plans to remedy the City's unconstitutional at-large district. Critically, as noted\nabove, the Court commenced remedial proceedings on July 1,2021, and has provided both parties\nwith the opportunity to remedy the constitutional violation. Therefore, the Court is not frustrating\nimplementing of any court- and state-approved districting plans.\nThe Defendants further argue that it will have \"... one less representative of voters to consider,\ndeliberate on, and vote on the myriad issues before the Council. It also creates a goveming body\nwith an even number of representatives, without a tie-breaking vote.\" See ECF No. 262 at 9. Here,\nthe Court considers who is allegedly being injured by maintaining the injunction and, most\nimportantly, who is not. Notably, the injunction is designed to prevent the City Council from using\nan unconstitutional electoral system to elect other city council members and further harm the\nminority community. That is, the injunction is designed to thwart the Defendants' (i.e. the City\nCouncil and its goveming members)u nconstitutional electoral policies, procedures, and system to\nprotect the public, particularly the minority community. The distinction is critical and one that\nDefendants failed to acknowledge.\n^ Moreover, the Court notes that the Defendants' argument that it is ordinary practice to suspend an injunction\npending appeal of a district court enjoining state officials from enforcing state laws deemed unconstitutional, is\nirrelevant for the reasons stated in Section HI.A . See ECF No. 262 at 8 (citing Strange v. Searcy, 135 S. Ct. 940,\n940( 2015)( Thomas, J., dissenting).\n13\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 14 of 22 PageID# 9305\nWhile the Court recognizes that the City Council may find itself in special circumstances\nbecause of Ms. Abbott's sudden resignation, for reasons articulated below, the equities still do not\nweigh in favor of the Defendants to justify lifting the temporary injunction. Still, though the Court\nrecognizes that being short one-representative may procedurally complicate matters for the\nCouncil members themselves, and increase their individual workload, the Court is not persuaded\nthat the Council cannot carry out the people's business with only ten elected officials. Notably, the\nDefendants did not provide evidence showing that the Council can only effectively function with\neleven-members or that there is constant gridlock requiring a tie-breaking vote. Moreover,\npursuant to the City Charter \"a majority of the council shall constitute a quorum for the\ntransaction of business.\" CODE OF ORDINANCES, City of Virginia Beach, Ch. 3, §§ 3.06;\n1973, Ch. 52,§  1. Thus, the City can still vote, pass measures, and carry out their business. While\nthe City Charter does not set out specific provisions for how the council can proceed with a\nten-member council, the Court has not doubt that the Council has previously operated in the\nabsence of city council members.\nEven if the Coiut accepted the Defendants' claim that there would be an adverse effect upon\nthe councils ability to conduct business in the absence of one-council member, the Court has to\nbalance this claim of injury with the injury that would be inflicted upon the public if the Court did\nnot provide a remedy to address to the constitutional violations it has found. The Court will\nbalance these claims below in Section lll.D.\nFinally, Defendants argue that it would be injured because the remedial plan has not been\ndeveloped yet and, thus, argues that \"the only way under present law for the City to avoid losing a\nmember of the City Cotmcil would be for the Court to rush out a remedial plan and to attempt to\nconduct the special election in November 2021 under that new plan. But such a strategy is\n14\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 15 of 22 PageID# 9306\nuntenable and would impose its own form of irreparable harm on the City.\" See ECF No. 262 at\n9-10. The Court disagrees with Defendants argument for three reasons. First, while it is true that\nthe Court is currently in the process of developing a remedial plan, the Court will not \"rush out a\nremedial plan\" as Defendants allege because that would be an irresponsible and inappropriate\nmanner to redress the City's longstanding violations of the minority community's constitutional\nrights, deeply steeped in a history of racial discrimination—^namely the right to vote. As the Court\nrecognized in its memorandum and opinion, ECF No. 242, though the City's at-large district has\nbeen in place since 1966, the City has elected only five Black Councilmembers and one\nAsian-American. ECF No. 190 at If 25. Moreover, the Court found that the City's policies and\nprocedures dilute the votes oft he minority community. Additionally, the Court notes that no Black\nCouncilmember had ever been re-elected. Second, the argument that the City is harmed by the\nComt's methodical remedial procedure dismisses, or at least obscures, the harm the city's electoral\nsystem has inflicted on the minority community. Accordingly, if the Court were to allow a special\nelection to occur under the current invalid and unconstitutional system, the Court could further\nharm the City's minority community. Finally, as examined in Senate Factor Eight in the Court's\nmemorandum and opinion, there is substantial evidence showing that, under the currently electoral\nsystem, the City has been consistently unresponsive to the economic and social needs of the\nMinority Community (e.g. Burton Station, the Disparity). See ECF No. 242 at 122- 131. This\nfinding severely undercuts the Defendants' present argument that a ten-member city council is\nharmful to the residents of Virginia Beach because on balance a special election could further be\nharmful to the minority community.\nOverall, in carefully weighing the City Councils' challenges in temporarily having a\nten-member board with the historic, and possibly ongoing, harms the council has inflicted on the\n15\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 16 of 22 PageID# 9307\nminority commimity via the unconstitutional electoral system,t he Court finds that any injury to the\nCouncil is not irreparable. Still, the Court recognizes that a ten-member board is not ideal and will\nmove as expeditiously as possible to craft a remedial plan. Critically, however, the Defendants\nhave not provided evidence that a stay is justified \"...by clear and convincing circumstances [and\nthat a stay] outweigh[s] potential harm to the party against whom it is operative.\" Williford v.\nArmstrong World Indus., Inc., 715 F.2d 124,127( 4th Cir. 1983);s ee also, Int'l Refugee Assistance\nProject V. Trump,3 23 F. Supp. 3d 726,731 (D. Md. 2018). The Court further notes that the parties\nmay revisit any injuiy inflicted by a temporary ten-member Council should evidence arise.\nC. Substantial Injury to Non-Movant\nThe Court does not agree with Plaintiffs' acceptance of the modification. As noted in the\nCourt's memorandum and opinion, the Plaintiffs' brought a suit on behalf of the minority\ncommunity of Virginia Beach alleging that the City's at-large electoral system dilutes the votes of\nthe minority community in violation of § 2 of the VRA. The Court found substantial evidence\nsupporting factual and legal findings demonstrating constitutional violations. Thus, the Court is\npuzzled on Plaintiffs counsel position in response to the Defendants motion. First, while Plaintiffs\naccept that a modification of the injunction is appropriate, their reasoning is based on speculating\nthe outcome of the Kempsville November 2021 special election and recognition that a special\nelection might be contrary to the minority community's interests. That is. Plaintiffs write that:\nIf the candidate elected in the November 2021 Kempsville special election resides\nin the area shown in the red circle (or potentially nearby), then it is likely that this\nCourt's remedial plan will be affected by the special election. This is so because\nMs. Abbott's term was set to expire in 2024, and therefore it is possible a special\nelection will yield a new incumbent, potentially one disfavored by the minority\ncommxmity who resides in one of the Section 2 remedial districts ordered by the\nCourt and who would remain in office through 2024.\n16\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 17 of 22 PageID# 9308\nECF No. 263 at 4 (emphasis in original). However, Plaintiffs then acknowledge that since the\n\"bulk of the Kempsville district is outside the geography likely to be included in the Court's\nremedial plan.,. it is likelier than not that the prevailing candidate will reside in the portion of the\ndistrict outside...\" where the majority of the minority community resides. Id. Plaintiffs also\npreviously note that a proposed remedial plan includes a portion of the Kempsville district which\n\"contains nearly 18,000 people, with a citizen voting age populations (\"CVAP\") that is 45.8%\nBlack, 9.3% Hispanic, 5.9% Asian, and 37.1% white.\" Id. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' lack of\nopposition is based on two flaws. First, Plaintiffs speculate that it is \"likelier\" that the elected\ncandidate oft he Kempsville special election would not be from the minority community,a nd,t hus,\nthis reasoning is speculative. Second, Plaintiffs' reasoning reinforces the logic behind the\nunconstitutional electoral system. That is, since the Kempsville district is drawn in a way that\ndilutes the votes of minorities, they are significantly less likely to elect a minority preferred\ncandidate of their choice. As the Court noted in its memorandum and opinion, based on evidence\nthat Plaintiffs presented, there is strong evidence of minority cohesive voting in the 2012 and 2016\nvoting with some evidence of white bloc voting. See ECF No. 242 at 75-76.\nSpecifically, the Court noted that in the 2012 election for the Kempsville District, Dr.\nRoss-Hammond (a Black woman), received about 65%( El)o f the all minority vote and 87%( El)\nsupport from Black voters but less than 20% from white voters. See ECF No. 242 at 75 (citing\nP-0077 at 20-21). Thus, there was evidence of minority cohesive voting and Dr. Ross-Hammond\nbecame only the third Black member oft he City Council in its fifty-five-year history. Id. However,\nin  2016, candidate  Ross-Hammond lost  re-election. Based on Dr. Spencer's analysis,\nRoss-Hammond was the preferred candidate of choice for all minority voters, with 59%( El), and\nBlack voters with 77%( El) support. Id. (citing P-0077 at 16). However, Ross-Hammond received\n17\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 18 of 22 PageID# 9309\nlow white voter support, with 33%( El). P-0077 at 15-16. On the other hand, her opponent, Jessica\nAbbot( a white woman)r eceived 69%( El) of the white vote but less than 40% of the all minority\nvote and less than 38% of Black vote. Id.\nCritically, as the Court noted in its analysis. Dr. Ross-Hammond credibly testified at trial\nthat she lost the election in large part due to the split between white and minority voters on the\nissue ofe xpanding the light rail. See Tr. 728:5-16( Dr. Ross-Hammond supported the light rail and\nthis issue \"played a major part\" in her re-election loss in 2016.); see also, DTX163( Abbott Dep.)\nat 162:1-3 (Jessica Abbott, opposed light rail). Ultimately, the Court concluded that \"[ajlthough\n[Dr. Ross-Hammond]h ad large support from the Minority Community in 2012 and 2016,s he only\nwon in 2012 because the white vote was split between three candidates and then lost in 2016\nbecause the white vote consolidated to support her opponent and, thus, block her re-election.\" ECF\nNo. 242 at 90.\nTherefore, the record shows the Kempsville is a district with a history of minority cohesive\nvoting and some evidence of white bloc voting. Accordingly, it is a district that contributes to\nviolating the minority community's right to vote. Therefore, Plaintiffs lack of opposition to\nDefendants' motion,i s incongruent with the evidence in the record. Most of all, ift he Court abided\nby the Plaintiffs' acceptance of the special election, the Court risks further perpetuating the\ndilution of minority voters in the Kempsville district.\nUltimately, the Court finds that there would be substantial injury to the Plaintiffs', notably\nthe minority community in the Kempsville district if the Court allowed the November 2021\nelection to occur by lifting the temporary injunction.\n18\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 19 of 22 PageID# 9310\nD. Public Interest\nFor the reasons articulated above, the Court finds that it would not be in the public interest to\nlift the temporary injunction and allow a special election for the Kempsville District in November\n2021. Defendants argue that:\n[t]he public's interest lies in favor of an eleven-member Council, not a ten-member\nCouncil. The public's interest also lies in favor of being permitted to vote in an\nelection for the vacant seat, not in being denied the opportunity to vote. And the\npublic interest lies in favor of election order, not election chaos.\nECF No. 262 at 17. Additionally, Defendants argue that the public interest would not be\nserved by rushing out a remedial plan. Id. at 18. Further, Defendants contend that the public\ninterest could be potentially harmed with the remedial districts because it is unclear, at this time,\nwhat their final composition will be. Id.\nIn order to exercise its discretion within the bounds of the law, a distnct court must \"weigh\ncompeting interests and maintain an even balance.\" Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, at 254\n(1936). As detailed in the Court's memorandum and opinion, see ECF No. 242, the current\nelectoral system has demonstrated evidence of harming the minority community of Virginia Beach\nbecause it dilutes their votes in violation of the Voting Rights Act. While the Court recognizes that\nit is currently in remedial proceedings, the Court found that the City Council has not been\nresponsive to the needs of the minority community. Accordingly, on balance, the Coiut finds that\nwhile the city council may face challenges in operating a ten-member board, it is ultimately not in\nthe public interest to hold a special election using an invalid system because it substantially risks\nfurther infringing the constitutional rights of the minority community.\n19\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 20 of 22 PageID# 9311\nE. Additional Factors\nAs noted above in section III.A, since the motion for a stay is situated before appeal and\nduring ongoing remedial proceedings, the Court may also examine Defendants' request pursuant\nto other factors for granting a stay. See, Ctr. for Int'l Envtl Law v. Office of the U.S. Trade\nRepresentative, 240 F. Supp. 2d 21,22-23 (D.D.C. 2003)( considering, among other factors, that\n\"this case presents an issue of first impression\").\nThe Court notes that the following factors provide the Court with greater discretion for\ngranting or denying a stay, and, so, it examines them in the alternative to the more rigid test\narticulated above. Typically, when a moving party requests the court to stay ongoing proceedings,\nsister courts have also considered \"(1)t he length oft he requested stay;( 2)t he hardship or inequity\nthat the movant would face in going forward with the litigation;( 3) the injury that a stay would\ninflict upon the non-movant; and (4) whether a stay would simplify issues and promote judicial\neconomy.\" Rajput v. Synchrony, 221 F. Supp. 3d 607, 609-10 (M.D. Pa. 2016); CTF Hotel\nHoldings, Inc. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 381 F.3d 131, 135-36( 3d Cir. 2004); see also, Int'l Rejugee\nAssistance Project v. Trump, 323 F. Supp. 3d 726, 731 (D. Md. 2018) (stating that \"When\nconsidering a discretionary motion to stay, courts typically examine three factors:( 1) the impact\non the orderly course ofj ustice, sometimes referred to as judicial economy, measured in terms of\nthe simplifying or complicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected\nfrom a stay; (2) the hardship to the moving party if the case is not stayed; and (3) the potential\ndamage or prejudice to the non-moving party if a stay is granted.\") (citing Lockyer v. Mirant\nCorp.,398 F.3d 1098, 1110(9thCir. 2005)', see also, Ortega Trujillo v. Conover&Co. Commc'ns,\nInc., 221 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir. 2000)( \"[T]he interests of judicial economy alone are\ninsufficient to justify... an indefinite stay\"); see also,\n20\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 21 of 22 PageID# 9312\nIn considering these additional factors, the Court has already discussed two at-length: 2)t he\nhardship or inequity that the movant would face in going forward with the litigation and (3) the\ninjury that a stay would inflict upon the non-movant. Thus, Court will examine the remaining\nadditional factors.\nFirst, regarding length of the stay, at first glance. Defendants only appear to request a stay\nuntil the November 2021 special election, which initially appears unproblematic. See ECF No.\n262. However, upon further inspection, there is disagreement between the parties regarding how\nlong the stay would apply to the Kempsville district after the special election. That is. Defendants\nand Plaintiffs disagree about how long the winning elected councilmember for the Kempsville\ndistrict should be allowed to hold office. On the one hand. Plaintiffs state that it \"reserves the right,\n[] as part of the remedial proceeding, to seek an order [] truncating the term of the candidate\nelected in the November 2021 special election in the event that the winning candidate resides in\none of the Section 2 remedial districts ordered by the Court.\" ECF No.2 63 at 4. On the other hand.\nDefendants \"intend to oppose future requests to alter term lengths of any members.\" ECF No. 262\nat 2. In all, the Court finds that Defendants are functionally asking the Court to stay the injunction\nuntil 2024 so that the wiiming candidate for the Kempsville district can serve a full term. While the\nCourt is cautious to attribute any ulterior motivate behind Defendants request to keep the winning\nKempsville candidate in office until 2024,t he Court notes that it has factually determined that the\nCity's electoral system, policies, and procedures have a long-history of racial discrimination and\nundermining the constitutional rights of the minority community. Critically, Defendants have\nsignaled that, even if the Court allowed a stay. Defendants would oppose any equitable measures\nto limit the winning candidate's term to abide by any Court ordered remedial plan.\n21\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 269   Filed 07/19/21   Page 22 of 22 PageID# 9313\nSecond, the Court finds that a stay would not simplify issues and promote judicial economy.\nAs previously noted, the Court has initiated remedial proceedings and has requested that both\nparties submit their briefings by July 30, 2021. While the Court will not rush remedial\nproceedings, the Court finds that a stay would negatively impact remedial proceedings as it will\ndetract the from the Court and parties time from crafting a remedial plan. See Chapman v. Meier,\n420 U.S. 1, 27, 95 S.Ct. 751, 42 L.Ed.2d 766 (1975)( holding that if a state fails to enact \"a\nconstitutionally acceptable\" remedial districting plan, \"the responsibility falls on the District\nCourt\"); Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 586, 84 S.Ct. 1362 (holding that a district court \"acted in a most\nproper and commendable manner\" by imposing its own remedial districting plan, affer the district\ncourt concluded that the remedial plan adopted by state legislature failed to remedy constitutional\nviolation).\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nTherefore, for the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion, ECF No. 262, is DENIED.\nThe Clerk is DIRECTED to electronically provide this Order to all parties.\nIT IS SO ORDERED\nNorfolk, Virginia\nJuly  /f,2021\nNITED STATES DISTRACT JUDGE\n22",

Before the district court ruled on that claim, however, \nVirginia’s General Assembly passed a law eliminating at-large voting for most of the seats \non the City Council.  Even so, the district court held, this case was not moot, the City’s old \nall-at-large electoral system violated Section 2, and the plaintiffs were entitled to an \ninjunction remedying that violation going forward.   \nWe agree with the City that the district court erred in reaching the merits.  The \nGeneral Assembly’s action left the plaintiffs challenging – and the district court assessing \n– an electoral system that no longer governs elections in Virginia Beach.  It follows that \nthis case is moot, and we therefore vacate the district court’s decisions.  But because the \nplaintiffs may have residual claims against the City’s new method for electing its Council, \nthe district court may consider on remand whether the plaintiffs should be granted leave to \namend their complaint, or develop the record more fully, to bring any new challenges as \npart of this proceeding. \n \n4 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 5 of 64\nI. \nA. \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits any election-related “standard, \npractice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen \nof the United States to vote on account of race or color.”  52 U.S.C. § 10301(a); see \n§ 10303(f)(2) (extending Section 2’s protections to “language minority group[s]”).  In \nThornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court established the framework for assessing at-large \nvoting systems under Section 2.  478 U.S. 30, 48–51 (1986).  At-large elections are not \n“per se violative of [Section] 2.”  Id. at 46.  But, the Court recognized, “at-large voting \nschemes may operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial minorities,” \nand when they do, they are prohibited.  Id. at 47 (cleaned up).  \nTo establish that an at-large system violates Section 2, a plaintiff first must meet \nthree  “preconditions,”  showing  that  (1) a  minority  group  is  “sufficiently  large  and \ngeographically  compact  to  constitute  a  majority  in  a  single-member  district”;  (2) the \nminority group is “politically cohesive”; and (3) “the white majority votes sufficiently as a \nbloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.”  Id. at 50–51.  \nThen, if all three preconditions are met, the plaintiff must show that “under the totality of \nthe  circumstances,”  the  at-large  system  “result[s]  in  unequal  access  to  the  electoral \nprocess.”  Id. at 46; see United States v. Charleston County, 365 F.3d 341, 345 (4th Cir. \n2004).  In undertaking this “totality of the circumstances” inquiry, courts typically rely on \nthe nine factors set out in the Senate Report accompanying Congress’s 1982 amendments \n5 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 6 of 64\nto Section 2, including the history of official discrimination in the region, minorities’ \nelectoral success, the use of discriminatory electoral devices, and the extent of racially \npolarized voting.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36–37; Charleston County, 365 F.3d at 345.   \nB. \nVirginia Beach, Virginia’s most populous city, is governed by a City Council, \ncomposed of the City’s mayor and ten councilmembers.  When this case began, every \ncouncilmember was elected at-large – that is, by all City voters, rather than the voters of a \nsingle district.  This meant that every candidate for City Council had to campaign for the \nvotes of all 450,000 City residents across the City’s 249 square miles.  In this respect, the \ndistrict court noted, Virginia Beach was “unique” among Virginia’s 13 largest cities, the \nothers of which elected all or most of their councilmembers from individual districts, with \nonly a minority – at most – elected at-large.  Holloway v. City of Virginia Beach, 531 F. \nSupp. 3d 1015, 1032–33, 1084 (E.D. Va. 2021). \nIn addition, seven of the Council’s members, though elected at-large, were required \nto reside in designated districts.  For those seats, in other words, candidates campaigned \nacross the entire City for specific seats corresponding to the districts in which they lived.  \nSuch “designated seat plans,” the Supreme Court recognized in Gingles, can make at-large \nelections  especially  dilutive  of  minority  votes,  preventing  minority  voters  from \nconcentrating their votes on a limited number of favored candidates.  See Gingles, 478 U.S. \nat 38–39 & nn.5–6.  The remaining three councilmembers were elected at-large and with \nno residency requirement. \n6 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 7 of 64\nTwo Virginia Beach residents – Latasha Holloway, a Black voter; and Georgia \nAllen, an unsuccessful Black candidate for City Council – sued, challenging the “at-large \nelection system used to elect members of the City Council of Virginia Beach.”  J.A. 47.  \nThat system, according to the plaintiffs – “in which all councilmembers are elected at-large \nin citywide elections” – resulted, under the totality of the circumstances, in the unlawful \ndilution of the voting strength of minority voters.  J.A. 48.  As a remedy, they sought a \ndeclaration that “Virginia Beach’s at-large method” of electing its City Council violated \nSection 2, an injunction preventing the City from conducting future elections “under the \ncurrent at-large method,” and an order requiring implementation of a Section 2-compliant \nelectoral system.  J.A. 61. \nAfter the district court denied the City’s motion for summary judgment, the case \nproceeded to a six-day bench trial.  Before the district court issued its post-trial decision, \nhowever, the City informed the court that Virginia’s General Assembly had enacted a new \nstatute, HB 2198, that would significantly affect the City’s “at-large residence system” of \nelecting councilmembers.  J.A. 1134–35.  Under HB 2198, any City Council candidate who \nis subject to a district-based residency requirement – that is, candidates for the seven \nCouncil seats described above – must “be elected by the qualified voters of that district . . . \nand not by the locality at large.”  Va. Code Ann. § 24.2-222(A) (codifying HB 2198).  \nGoing forward, in other words, candidates for most City Council seats – the seven with \nresidency requirements – would run for office in single-member districts.  And candidates \nfor only three seats – those without any residency requirement – would continue to be \n7 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 8 of 64\nelected at-large.  This new law, according to the City, superseded the entirely at-large \nsystem challenged by the plaintiffs, rendering that system “no longer legally permissible \nas a matter of state law.”  J.A. 1135.  And as a result, the City argued, the plaintiffs’ case \nagainst that system was now moot.   \nA week after the City informed the court of HB 2198, the district court issued a \ncomprehensive and thoroughly reasoned decision holding in the plaintiffs’ favor.  See \nHolloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d 1015.  The district court began by rejecting the City’s argument \nthat the case was moot in light of HB 2198.  The new state law, the court explained, did \nnot “specifically address” the plaintiffs’ claims, nor provide them all the relief they sought, \nand so “the issues [we]re still live.”  Id. at 1027 n.1.  Moreover, the court reasoned, \nHB 2198 would not necessarily lead to a change in Virginia Beach’s at-large election \nsystem:  The City could retain at-large voting for all of its City Council seats by eliminating \nthe district residency requirements in its city charter.  Id. \nThe court then assessed the merits of the plaintiffs’ challenge to the pre-HB 2198 \nsystem, holding with the plaintiffs at each step:  The plaintiffs had satisfied each of the \nGingles preconditions and, under the totality of the circumstances, the City’s all-at-large \nelectoral system diluted the votes of minority voters.  Id. at 1048–1102.  The court thus \ndeclared the City’s “at-large method of election” illegal, enjoined further use of that \nsystem, and granted plaintiffs’ request for fees and costs.  Id. at 1102.  It reserved decision \non a more specific remedial order, pending further proceedings.  Id.  And after receiving \nproposed remedial plans from the plaintiffs, the City, and a court-appointed special master, \n8 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 9 of 64\nthe court adopted the special master’s proposal, ordering the City to implement a plan with \nten single-member districts, including three districts where  minority voters formed a \nmajority of the voting population.  See Holloway v. City of Virginia Beach, No. 2:18-CV-\n69, 2021 WL 6199585, at *2 & n.2 (E.D. Va. Dec. 22, 2021).   \nThe City timely appealed the district court’s decisions. \n \nII. \nOn appeal, we confront an unusual situation:  Both sides think this proceeding is \nmoot, but for different reasons.  The City continues to argue that HB 2198, enacted before \nthe district court’s ruling, mooted the plaintiffs’ case against Virginia Beach’s entirely at-\nlarge system for electing councilmembers.  The plaintiffs, for their part, contend that their \ncase survived HB 2198, but that the City’s appeal was mooted by events that transpired \nafter the district court ruled – first, enactment of yet another new state law, the Virginia \nVoting Rights Act; and then preclearance under that law of the district court’s remedial \nplan.  See Va. Code Ann. § 24.2-129(D).  The upshot is that neither party believes we have \njurisdiction to hear this case.  See ECF No. 80-1 at 1 (“At this point, both parties contend \nthis case has become moot.”). \n9 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 10 of 64\nWe agree, and, specifically, we agree with the City:  The plaintiffs’ case became \nmoot with the passage of HB 2198.1  That law eliminated the unusual Virginia Beach all-\nat-large system at the heart of this case, leaving the district court without jurisdiction to \nrule on the legality of that system and thus without jurisdiction to direct a remedy.  We \nrecognize the plaintiffs’ concern that a new, HB 2198-compliant system – one in which \ncandidates for some, but not all, City Council seats must run at-large – may itself violate \nSection 2.  But that is a claim that they must plead and prove first in the trial court.  \nAccordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to decide whether the plaintiffs \nmay pursue such a challenge in this case. \n \n1 By contrast, we are  not persuaded that the City’s appeal was  mooted when \nVirginia’s attorney general, acting under the newly enacted Virginia Voting Rights Act, \nprecleared the district court’s remedial plan in January of 2022.  According to the plaintiffs, \nonce precleared, that plan became the de facto electoral system for the City and would \nremain so regardless of the outcome of this appeal.  The City disagrees, arguing that \npreclearance permits, but does not require, use of the court-ordered plan, and that it could \nconsider  other  options  should  we  vacate  or  reverse  the  district  court’s  decisions.  \nRegardless  of the precise implications of  preclearance under state law, we think the \npersistence of a federal injunction directing City election procedures is enough to give the \nCity a “live” stake in the outcome of this appeal.  See Norfolk S. Ry. v. City of Alexandria, \n608 F.3d 150, 161 (4th Cir. 2010).  Vacating that injunction would have the “practical \neffect” of allowing the City, at a minimum, to seek preclearance of a plan other than the \none imposed by the district court.  Id.   \nWe note, however, that at whatever point this case became moot, the result would \nbe the same.  Even if, that is, the plaintiffs were correct that this case became moot only on \nappeal, we still would vacate the district court’s judgment, as is customary when cases \nmoot out on appeal through no fault of the parties.  See id. at 161 (“The customary practice \nwhen a case is rendered moot on appeal is to vacate the moot aspects of the lower court’s \njudgment.”); see also U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P’ship, 513 U.S. 18, 25 & \nn.3 (1994) (holding that, because parties “ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce in \n[a] judgment” when circumstances outside their control moot a case precluding review of \nthat judgment, “mootness by happenstance provides sufficient reason to vacate”).   \n10 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 11 of 64\n Our jurisdiction under Article III is limited to cases and controversies.  See U.S. \nConst. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; Catawba Riverkeeper Found. v. N.C. Dep’t of Transp., 843 F.3d \n583, 588 (4th Cir. 2016).  That limit applies at all stages of a case; a “suit must remain alive \nthroughout the course of litigation,” and even if there is a justiciable controversy when a \ncomplaint is filed, “subsequent events can moot the claim.”  Catawba Riverkeeper Found., \n843 F.3d at 588 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Whether a case has become moot is a \nquestion we review de novo.  Porter v. Clarke, 852 F.3d 358, 363 (4th Cir. 2017). \nA dispute is moot, depriving federal courts of jurisdiction to decide it, when “the \nissues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the \noutcome.”  Catawba  Riverkeeper Found., 843 F.3d at 588 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  And ordinarily, “statutory changes that discontinue a challenged practice” are \nenough to render a case moot under this standard.  Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Paige, 211 \nF.3d 112, 116 (4th Cir. 2000).  To be sure, not every tweak to a challenged statute will \nhave this effect; “minor and insignificant” changes that do not address the essence of a \nplaintiff’s claims will not forestall legal challenges to the original statute.  Id.  But when a \nchallenged law is “superseded by a significantly amended statutory scheme,” then a claim \nagainst the original law becomes moot.  Esposito v. S.C. Coastal Council, 939 F.2d 165, \n171 (4th Cir. 1991).  “Whatever the merits of the District Court’s conclusions on the earlier \nstatutes, any challenge to the new provisions presents a different case.”  Allee v. Medrano, \n416 U.S. 802, 818 (1974) (addressing potential mootness when challenged statutes were \nreplaced by “more narrowly drawn” enactments). \n11 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 12 of 64\nThe Supreme Court recently confirmed this framework, holding that legislative \namendments to New York’s firearm licensing statute, enacted after commencement of \nlitigation, rendered moot a Second Amendment challenge to the original law.  See N.Y. \nState Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. City of New York, 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1526 (2020).  Those \namendments, as the Court described them, were significant enough to “change [] the legal \nframework governing the case,” giving the plaintiffs all they sought in their complaint, and \nthus mooting their challenge.  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  And importantly, the \nCourt clarified, the plaintiffs’ “residual claim” against the new and amended licensing \nscheme did not save their original challenge from mootness.  Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted).   \nUnder these principles, HB 2198 mooted this case, “supersed[ing]” the challenged \nelectoral system and replacing it with one that is “significantly” different.  Esposito, 939 \nF.2d at 171.  The plaintiffs’ challenge was not to the use of any at-large voting in City \nCouncil elections – nor could it have been, under the governing Gingles framework.  See \n478 U.S. at 46 (explaining that at-large voting is not per se violative of Section 2).  Instead, \nthey alleged that Virginia Beach’s particular at-large system, evaluated under the totality \nof the circumstances, operated to dilute minority voting strength.  See id.; J.A. 60 (“The \ntotality of the circumstances establish that the at-large election scheme currently in place \nhas the effect of denying Minority Voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political \nprocess . . . , in violation of Section 2.” (emphasis added)).   \n12 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 13 of 64\nAnd that particular system, the plaintiffs explained, was an anomalous one – unique \nin Virginia – that coupled at-large voting for all City Council seats with designated \nresidency requirements for most of those seats.  Their amended complaint was clear on \nthis.  See J.A. 48 (describing challenged election method “in which all councilmembers are \nelected at-large in citywide elections” (emphasis added)).  Their expert explained the \nunusual and especially dilutive nature of a system pairing at-large voting with residency \nrequirements.  See J.A. 1743 (“Virginia Beach uniquely maintains numbered or designated \nposts for the election of the majority of city council members, a well-known device that \noften enhances the discriminatory nature of an at-large election system.”); J.A. 1681 \n(same).  And the district court, in finding a Section 2 violation, emphasized these specific \nfeatures of  Virginia Beach’s system:  It noted that the City’s exclusive use of at-large \nvoting made it “unique” among Virginia’s largest cities, others of which used single-\nmember districts or “mixed at-large/district system[s] . . . , with the majority elected from \ndistricts.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1032–33.  It detailed the way in which the overlap \nof at-large voting and designated residency seats “exacerbates the discriminatory effect of \nat-large elections.”  Id. at 1084–85 (citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 39 & n.5).  And it found \nthat no other city in the state “share[d] Virginia Beach’s combination of at-large elections, \ndesignated seats for most positions, and staggered terms,” faulting the City for failing to \nprovide a “reasonable explanation” for its outlier system.  Id. at 1102.   \nHB  2198  transformed these  challenged  aspects of  the  City’s  electoral  system, \nfundamentally altering the “legal framework” at issue in plaintiffs’ case.  N.Y. State Rifle \n13 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 14 of 64\n& Pistol Ass’n, 140 S. Ct. at 1526 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Candidates for the \nCouncil’s seven residency seats no longer will be elected at-large; instead, they must be \nchosen by the voters of their individual districts.  Va. Code Ann. § 24.2-222(A).  Only \nthree  seats  remain  subject  to  at-large  voting,2  and  those  seats  lack  the  residency \nrequirements that made most of the City’s prior at-large elections especially burdensome \nfor  minority  candidates  and  dilutive  of  minority  votes.    “[A]nything  but  minor  and \ninsignificant,” HB 2198’s changes bear directly on the plaintiffs’ challenge, Valero, 211 \nF.3d at 116, eliminating some of the chief offending features of the City’s challenged \nsystem, and bringing it more closely into line with those used by cities of comparable size \nin Virginia and cited favorably by the district court in its decision, see Holloway, 531 F. \nSupp. 3d at 1032–33, 1084. \nIndeed, we already have recognized that a Section 2 challenge becomes moot in \nessentially the same scenario.  See NAACP v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth Cnty. Bd. of Educ., \n959 F.2d 231, 1992 WL 64875, at *1 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 1992) (unpublished table decision).  \nIn that case, the plaintiffs had challenged an all-at-large system for electing Board of \nEducation members, and a state law changed significant elements of the at-large system in \ndispute:  In the future, “some of the members” – but not all – would be elected by district \nrather than at-large, and all would be elected simultaneously rather than in staggered terms.  \n \n2 We recognize that Virginia Beach’s mayor – who also sits on the City Council – \nis elected at-large, as well.  But in discussing HB 2198, the parties speak only of the three \nat-large Council seats held by non-mayoral councilmembers, and we follow their lead.   \n14 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 15 of 64\nId.  That was enough to moot the plaintiffs’ lawsuit against the now-altered electoral \nsystem.  Id.; see also White v. Regester, 422 U.S. 935, 935–36 (1975) (per curiam) \n(vacating district court judgment and remanding in light of potential mootness, where state \nreplaced at-large districts with single-member districts). \nUnder these well-established mootness principles, federal courts may not opine on \nthe merits of a case when doing so would have no “practical effect on the outcome of the \nmatter.”  Norfolk S. Ry. v. City of Alexandria, 608 F.3d 150, 161 (4th Cir. 2010).  That is \nthe case here, just as it was in the above-cited authority, because by virtue of HB 2198, the \nplaintiffs already have gotten all that they asked for in their amended complaint.  That law \nalready prevents the City from “administering, implementing, or conducting any future \nelections in the City of Virginia Beach under the current at-large method of election.”  J.A. \n61 (emphasis added).  The plaintiffs’ claim for relief “with respect to the City’s old \n[system] is therefore moot.”  N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, 140 S. Ct. at 1526.  The only \nthing a court can add now is an advisory opinion as to the legal status of an effectively \ndefunct  electoral  system,  and  that,  of  course,  lies  outside  the  scope  of  Article  III \njurisdiction.  See Catawba Riverkeeper Found., 843 F.3d at 589; Norfolk S. Ry., 608 F.3d \nat 161.  \nThe plaintiffs argue – and the district court appears to have agreed, see Holloway, \n531 F. Supp. 3d at 1027 n.1 – that a court still could provide them with effectual relief \nbecause they sought not only an injunction against the City’s current election system, but \nalso an order directing implementation of a new system that “compl[ies] with Section 2,” \n15 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 16 of 64\nJ.A. 61.  But this has things backwards.  The plaintiffs have no right to that court-ordered \nrelief in the abstract; until they have proven that specific conduct by the City violates \nSection 2, “there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.”  Growe v. Emison, 507 \nU.S. 25, 40–41 (1993); see McGhee v. Granville County, 860 F.2d 110, 117–18 (4th Cir. \n1988) (holding that Section 2 remedies must respond to “the dilution proximately caused \nby” a challenged “electoral law, practice, or structure” (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47)).  \nAnd  regardless  of  whether  the  plaintiffs  proved  that  the  City’s  old  system  violated \nSection 2 – a question we have no jurisdiction to entertain – they have not shown, and the \ndistrict court did not find, that any new, HB 2198-compliant system does so. \nWe recognize, as the plaintiffs stress, that HB 2198 will allow the City to maintain \nat-large elections for three of its City Council seats.  But as discussed above, the district \ncourt did not find – indeed, the plaintiffs in their amended complaint did not allege3 – that \n \n3 The dissent disagrees with this assessment, noting that the amended complaint, at \npoints, contemplated a complete end to all at-large voting in Virginia Beach, see Dissenting \nOp. at 31 (quoting J.A. 48–49), and proposed an illustrative plan with ten single-member \ndistricts and no at-large voting, id. at 35 (citing J.A. 55).  But the record is clear that the \nplaintiffs’ challenge was to “the current at-large method of election,” J.A. 61, which they \ndefined as one characterized by all-at-large voting.  See J.A. 48 (“That election method, in \nwhich all councilmembers are elected at-large in citywide elections, unlawfully dilutes the \nvoting strength of Minority Voters[.]” (emphasis added)).  Their “demand for relief” said \nso.  See J.A. 61 (seeking injunction against any further use of “the current at-large method \nof election”).  And the plaintiffs reiterated the point at trial, objecting to defense counsel’s \nsuggestion that the ten-single-member plan laid out in their amended complaint was the \nrelief they were seeking:  While a ten-district plan could be drawn consistent with the \nGingles framework, the plaintiffs clarified, the remedy that they had requested was simply \nthat the court “strike down the current system and ask the City to draw a different system.  \nWhether that is a ten-district plan or something else is not what we’re requesting.”  J.A. \n800 (emphasis added). \n16 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 17 of 64\nany use of at-large voting in City Council elections would violate Section 2. And while the \ndistrict court did assess the general effects of at-large voting in Virginia Beach, it did so \nnot in a vacuum but under a “totality of the circumstances” analysis that required exactly \nwhat the district court provided:  careful focus on the history and effects of a particular \nelectoral system that uniquely required all candidates to run at-large and most candidates \nto do so from especially problematic designated districts.  See Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d \nat 1079–1102.  That system – and the plaintiffs’ case against it – came to an end with \nHB 2198.  \nIt may be, as the plaintiffs further suggest, that they will have challenges to any new \nelectoral method adopted by the City that maintains even three at-large seats.  And those \nchallenges may overlap substantially with their first one, especially with respect to the three \nGingles preconditions.  But as in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, those “residual \nclaim[s]” cannot resuscitate plaintiffs’ moot claims against the old system.  140 S. Ct. \nat 1526 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Any challenge to the new system will present \na different  case,  demanding  its  own  similarly  sensitive analysis.    See  De Grandy  v. \nJohnson, 512 U.S. 997, 1009–13 & n.10 (1994) (emphasizing that even where the three \nGingles preconditions have been satisfied, courts must go on to examine the totality of the \ncircumstances and the extent to which a challenged system, in fact, allows minority voters \nto participate equally in the political process).   \nFinally,  the  district  court  suggested  that  the  City’s  voluntary  cessation  of  the \nchallenged conduct could not moot the plaintiffs’ challenge, given that the City remained \n17 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 18 of 64\nfree  to  return  to  an  entirely  at-large  system  by  “elimat[ing]  the  district  residency \nrequirements for the seven seats on the City Council.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1027 \nn.1 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n190 (2000) (applying the voluntary cessation doctrine)).  We think this misapprehends both \nthe voluntary cessation doctrine and Virginia state law.  First, the City did not voluntarily \ncease  anything;  instead,  the  General  Assembly enacted a  new  voting-rights  law  that \neliminated a device the City had kept on its books for decades.  Cf. Catawba Riverkeeper \nFound., 843 F.3d at 589–91 (declining to impute acts of state legislature to state agency, \neven where agency lobbied for changes to state law, in deciding whether mootness resulted \nfrom the defendant agency’s “voluntary action” for vacatur purposes).  The plaintiffs have \nnot argued that the City sought or in any way influenced the legislative enactment at issue \nhere, and we are unaware of any evidence that would support such a claim.  It follows, we \nthink, that the City itself has engaged in no “voluntary” action implicating the voluntary \ncessation doctrine. \nAs for state law, the district court seems to have overestimated the City’s authority \nto reinstate at-large elections for all City Council seats.  Virginia Beach’s City Charter \nimposes residency requirements on seven of those seats.  See Va. Beach, Va., Charter \n§ 3.01.  And it is only the General Assembly – not the City – that can amend that charter.  \nSee Va. Code Ann. §§ 15.2-200 to 203; Pritchett v. City Council, 105 Va. Cir. 465, 2020 \nWL 8832558, at *2 (2020) (unpublished).  So contrary to the district court’s assumption, \nwithout further legislative action, the City cannot side-step HB 2198 and return to an \n18 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 19 of 64\nentirely at-large system by eliminating its residency requirements.  And lacking that power, \nthe City does not have “the authority and capacity to repeat [the] alleged harm,” as the \nvoluntary cessation doctrine would require.  Courthouse News Serv. v. Schaefer, 2 F.4th \n318, 323 (4th Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn sum, HB 2198 prevented the City from conducting any future City Council \nelections under the electoral system that the plaintiffs challenged, and other aspects of state \nand local law precluded the City from returning unilaterally to its old ways.  Under those \ncircumstances, the plaintiffs’ challenge is moot, and the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider its merits.  Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s judgment – as to both \nliability and remedy – and remand.  See, e.g., Benham v. City of Charlotte, 635 F.3d 129, \n134, 139 (4th Cir. 2011) (“If an appellate court determines that the district court lacked \njurisdiction, vacatur of the district court’s ruling, along with a remand with instructions to \ndismiss, is the appropriate disposition.”).   \nThat said, while our usual practice at this point would be to further instruct the \ndistrict court to dismiss the case upon remand, see id., we depart from that custom here.  \nAs the Supreme Court has recently explained, a different course may be appropriate where \n– as here – mootness “is attributable to a change in the legal framework governing the case, \nand where the plaintiff may have some residual claim under the new framework that was \nunderstandably not asserted previously.”  N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, 140 S. Ct. at 1526 \n(quoting Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 482 (1990)).  In those circumstances, \nthe Supreme Court advised, courts can “vacate the judgment and remand for further \n19 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 20 of 64\nproceedings in which the parties may, if necessary, amend their pleadings or develop the \nrecord more fully.”  Id. (quoting Lewis, 494 U.S. at 482).   \nWe  follow  that  advice  here,  and  remand  without  instructions  to  dismiss  the \nplaintiffs’ case.  The plaintiffs maintain that they still may have viable challenges to \nwhatever post-HB 2198 electoral system the City adopts.  And if they do, the parties and \ndistrict court likely will have done much – though not all – of the work necessary to analyze \nthose claims.  On remand, the plaintiffs may raise any claims they have against the City’s \nsystem going forward.  The district court then can decide whether the plaintiffs should be \npermitted to amend their complaint or otherwise develop the record to pursue those claims \nhere, or whether they are better pursued in a new proceeding.   \n \nIII. \n  For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court’s judgment and remand the \ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.   \nVACATED AND REMANDED \n20 \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 21 of 64\n \nGREGORY, Chief Judge, dissenting: \nI respectfully disagree that this case became moot with the passage of HB 2198.1  It \nmay be that the City can no longer legally use at-large voting for seven of its ten City \nCouncil seats, but the fact that some of the City’s electoral system2 is now invalid is not \nipso facto enough to moot plaintiffs’ challenge to that system.  Indeed, the majority opinion \nacknowledges as much when it recognizes that statutory changes that do not reach the \n“essence of a plaintiff’s claims will not forestall legal challenges to the original statute.”  \nAnte, at 11.  The crux of plaintiffs’ challenge is to at-large voting in the City of Virginia \nBeach and plaintiffs’ complaint outlined an injury and corresponding remedy based on all \nten (nonmayoral) at-large districts.  Thus, I do not believe that plaintiffs have been granted \n“precise relief” by HB 2198 which does not eliminate at-large voting for three of the City \nCouncil’s seats or determine the boundaries of its defacto seven single-member districts.  \nRather, in finding this case moot, I believe the majority expands rather than adheres to the \nSupreme Court’s recent decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. City of New \nYork, 140 S. Ct. 1525 (2020) (per curiam), which merely reaffirmed that a case becomes \nmoot when a court is no longer able to grant “effectual” or “precise” relief. \nFurther, I would find that plaintiffs have standing to pursue this suit and affirm the \ndistrict court’s conclusions on the merits. \n \n1 I agree with the majority, however, that the City’s appeal is not moot. \n2 Notably, HB 2198 did not rescind the City’s electoral system nor replace that \nsystem with an alternative; it merely rendered aspects of the City’s plan impermissible \nunder Virginia law. \n21 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 22 of 64\n \nI. \nA. \nArticle III, § 2 limits our jurisdiction to “Cases” and “Controversies.”  See US. \nConst.  art.  III,  § 2,  cl.1.    Thus, if a  controversy  becomes  moot,  we  no longer have \njurisdiction to consider it.  “[B]ut it is equally true, that . . . [w]e have no more right to \ndecline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.”  \nCohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 404, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821). \nA case “becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual \nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.”  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013).  In \nother words, “[a] case is moot when ‘our resolution of an issue could not possibly have any \npractical effect on the outcome of the matter.’”  Catawba Riverkeeper Found. v. N. C. Dep’t \nof Transp., 843 F.3d 583, 588 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. City of \nAlexandria, 608 F.3d 150, 161 (4th Cir. 2010)).  Under this “demanding standard,” Mission \nProd. Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 1652, 1660 (2019), “[a]s long as the \nparties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation, the case is \nnot moot.”  Catawba Riverkeeper, 843 F.3d at 588. \nA challenge to a statute or ordinance typically becomes moot if the challenged \nprovision expires or is rescinded in full.  See, e.g., Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361, 363 \n(1987); Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 377, 377 (2017).  But where a statutory change amends \nor replaces—rather than rescinds—a challenged law, how much of a change is “enough” \nto moot a plaintiffs’ claim? \n22 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 23 of 64\n \nIt is not sufficient that an amended statute “differs in certain respects from the old \none.”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 \nU.S. 656, 662 (1993); see also H.B. Rowe Co. v. Tippett, 615 F.3d 233, 240 (4th Cir. 2010) \n(affirming the district court’s finding that a challenge to a statute was not moot though “the \namended statute did ‘away with many of [the] alleged shortcomings of its predecessor’ and \nso  ‘undoubtably  differs  from  the  old  [statute]  in  material  respects’”  (alterations  in \noriginal)).  Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether the new ordinance or statute “resolve[s] \nthe primary problem which the Plaintiff first complained of.”  H.B. Rowe Co., 615 F.3d at \n240; see also Naturist Soc’y, Inc. v. Fillyaw, 958 F.2d 1515, 1520 (11th Cir. 1992) (“The \nentire case becomes moot only where ‘a superseding statute . . . satisfies all the principles \nsought in an attack on the prior statute.’”).  Thus, as the Supreme Court recently confirmed, \na change to a statutory framework moots a suit where the change provides “the precise \nrelief that petitioners requested in the prayer for relief in their complaint.”  N.Y. State Rifle, \n140 S. Ct. at 1526 (emphasis added); see also Esposito v. S.C. Coastal Council, 939 F.2d \n165, 171 (4th Cir. 1991) (finding a challenge to a statute moot when the challenged law \nwas “superseded by a significantly amended statutory scheme” such that “[the] remedy \ngranted by the district court has become pointless”); Ciudadanos Unidos De San Juan v. \nHidalgo Cnty. Grand Jury Comm’rs, 622 F.2d 807, 824 (5th Cir. 1980) (“In those cases in \nwhich a statutory amendment has been held to moot a controversy arising under the prior \nversion of the statute, the amendment has generally been one which completely eliminated \nthe harm of which plaintiffs complained.” (emphasis added)).  But where the “gravamen \nof petitioner’s complaint” remains, a statutory change will not render the case moot.  City \n23 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 24 of 64\n \nof Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 662 (“The new ordinance may disadvantage [petitioners] to a \nlesser degree than the old one, but . . . it disadvantages them in the same fundamental \nway.”). \nB. \nThe City of Virginia Beach has relied on at-large elections for its City Council seats \nfor over fifty years.  In 1966 the City adopted an electoral scheme that called for at-large \nelections for the City Council’s eleven members, including the mayor, with seven members \nrequired to run from designated residential districts.  Although the minority voting age \npopulation of Virginia Beach has increased to 38.5 percent, only five Black candidates and \none Asian-American candidate have been elected to the City Council since 1966. \nPlaintiffs are two Black registered voters and residents of the City of Virginia \nBeach, one of whom ran unsuccessfully for a City Council seat in 2008.  Plaintiffs filed \nsuit against the City of Virginia Beach alleging that its at-large method of election for the \nCity’s ten (non-mayoral) City Council seats violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n(VRA)  because  it  “submerges  Minority  Voters  so  that  they  are  rendered  ineffective \nelectoral minorities in most elections” and, therefore, “denies Virginia Beach’s Minority \nVoters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect councilmembers \nof their choice.”  J.A. 51–52.3  Plaintiffs sought “(1) a declaratory judgment that the at-\nlarge election system for electing members to the City Council violates their civil rights by \nunlawfully diluting the voting strength of Minority Voters; (2) an injunction against the \n \n3 Citations to “J.A.” refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal. \n24 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 25 of 64\n \nfurther use of at-large elections for the City Council; [and] (3) an order requiring future \nelections for the City Council to be conducted under a method that complies with the \nConstitution and the Voting Rights Act.”  J.A. 48–49.4 \nFollowing a six-day bench trial, the district court found in plaintiffs’ favor and, \ntherefore, declared that “Virginia Beach’s at-large method of election” violated Section 2 \nand enjoined “any further use of the at-large system of election for the Virginia Beach City \nCouncil.”  Holloway v. City of Virginia Beach, 531 F. Supp. 3d 1015, 1102 (E.D. Va. \n2021).  Several months later, the court ordered the City to implement a remedial plan, \nconsisting of ten single-member districts, proposed by a court-appointed Special Master.  \nHolloway v. City of Virginia Beach, No. 2:18-cv-69, 2021 WL 6199585, at *3 (E.D. Va. \nDec. 22, 2021). \nOne week before the district court issued its initial decision in this case, the Virginia \nState Assembly passed HB 2198 which requires that “in a city or town that imposes district-\nbased or ward-based residency requirements for members of the city or town council, the \nmember elected from each district or ward shall be elected by the qualified voters of that \ndistrict or ward and not by the locality at large.”  V.A. Code Ann. § 24.2-222 (West 2022) \n(codifying HB 2198).  In other words, under HB 2198, the City of Virginia Beach is now \n \n4 This description of the relief requested by plaintiffs comes from the introduction \nto the complaint.  In the complaint’s demand for relief, plaintiffs described their request \nfor relief as follows:  “[A]n order (a) [d]eclaring that Virginia Beach’s at-large method of \nelecting members to the City Council violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; (b) \n[e]njoining [d]efendants, . . . from administering, implementing, or conducting any future \nelections in the City of Virginia Beach under the current at-large method of election; [and] \n(c) [o]rdering the implementation of an election system for the City Council that complies \nwith Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.” J.A. 61. \n25 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 26 of 64\n \nprohibited from using a system of at-large voting for the seven seats for which it imposes \ndistrict residency requirements.5  HB 2198, however, has no impact on the three (non-\nmayoral) at-large seats without residency requirements or on the boundaries of the City’s \nresidency districts. \nC. \nRelying on  the  Supreme Court’s  recent decision in New  York State Rifle, the \nmajority finds that plaintiffs’ case became moot with the passage of HB 2198. \nIn New York State Rifle, the Supreme Court considered a constitutional challenge to \na New York City ordinance that prohibited gun owners with “premises licenses” from \nleaving their home with a licensed firearm except when traveling to seven “authorized” \ngun ranges that were all located within the City of New York.  140 S. Ct. 1525.  Petitioners \nsought to bring their firearms to gun ranges and second residences located outside of the \nCity.  Id. at 1526.  After the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case, the City \nadopted a new rule that permitted  licensed gun  owners to travel with their firearms \n“directly”  to ranges and second homes outside the City.  Id.; id. at 1532 (Alito,  J., \ndissenting).  Further, the State of New York also enacted a law preventing any local law, \nrule, or regulation from barring the holder of a premises license from carrying the licensed \nfirearm “directly to or from” an authorized range or second home.  See N.Y. Penal Law \n§ 400.00(6) (McKinney 2019).  Despite these legal changes, petitioners maintained that \n \n5 The residency requirement for these seven seats is included in the City’s charter, \nwhich can only be modified by the General Assembly.  See Va. Beach, Va., Charter § 3.01; \nVa. Code Ann. §§ 15.2-200 to 203. \n26 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 27 of 64\n \ntheir suit was not moot because they had alleged in their amended complaint that the \nSecond Amendment protects “unrestricted access to gun ranges and shooting events.”  N.Y. \nState Rifle, 140 S. Ct. at 1531 (Alito, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).  Thus, petitioners \nargued that “the new rule may still infringe their rights” because “they may not be allowed \nto stop for coffee, gas, food, or restroom breaks on the way” to gun ranges and second \nhomes.  Id. at 1526; see also id. at 1534 (Alito, J., dissenting) (“The bottom line is that \npetitioners, who sought ‘unrestricted access’ to out-of-city ranges and competitions, are \nstill subject to restrictions of undetermined meaning.”). \nThe New York State Rifle Court rejected petitioner’s argument and held that the suit \nwas moot because “petitioners may now transport firearms to a second home or shooting \nrange outside of the city, which is the precise relief that petitioners requested.”  Id. at 1526.  \nThe per curiam opinion did not mention plaintiffs’ use of the phrase “unrestricted access” \nin their complaint, but it clearly rejected the argument that such language alone provided a \nsufficient basis for finding that plaintiffs had not received “precise” relief.  Id.  Rather, the \nCourt characterized plaintiffs’ claim regarding their inability to engage in routine stops on \nthe way to shooting ranges or second homes as a “residual claim under the new framework \nthat was understandably not asserted previously” and, therefore, remanded the case to \npermit plaintiffs to “amend their pleadings or develop the record more fully” on the new \nclaims.  Id. \nThe majority, here, analogizes plaintiffs’ case to that of the plaintiffs in New York \nState Rifle.  But this case is distinguishable.  The gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint in New \nYork State Rifle was plaintiffs’ inability to travel to gun ranges and second homes out of \n27 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 28 of 64\n \nthe City with their permitted weapons.  The mooting legislation in that case then provided \nthat exact relief:  the ability to travel with permitted weapons to gun ranges and second \nhomes out of the City. \nUnlike the plaintiffs in New York State Rifle, plaintiffs here have not received the \n“precise relief” they sought.  Plaintiffs challenged the City’s use of at-large voting for its \nten (nonmayoral) City Council seats and did so, under the applicable Gingles framework, \nby comparing the City’s at-large electoral system with an illustrative plan consisting of ten \nsingle-member districts with its boundaries drawn in such a way that the minority citizen \nvoting age population composed a majority in two districts.  J.A. 55.  While HB 2198 now \nprevents the City from using at-large voting for seven of its Council seats, the legislation \ndoes not impact the use of at-large voting for three seats nor does it affect the boundaries \nof the defacto6 seven single-member districts.  By applying New York State Rifle here, \nwhere plaintiffs received only some of the relief requested in their complaint, I believe the \nmajority expands the reach of that case. 7 \n \n6 Unlike in New York State Rifle, HB 2198 does not rescind or replace the City’s \nelectoral system but merely renders aspects of it illegal. \n7 The dissent in New York State Rifle foreshadowed this concern.  See 140 S. Ct. at \n1539–40 (Alito, J., dissenting).  The dissent provided the following hypotheticals to \nillustrate the point: \n \nSuppose that a city council, seeking to suppress a local paper’s opposition to \nsome of its programs, adopts an ordinance prohibiting the publication of any \neditorial without the approval of a city official.  Suppose that a newspaper \nchallenges the constitutionality of this rule, arguing that the First Amendment \nconfers the unrestricted right to editorialize without prior approval.  If the \n(Continued) \n \n28 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 29 of 64\n \nD. \nAt bottom, my disagreement with the majority is a matter of degree:  how much of \na change to a statutory scheme is sufficient to moot a suit related to that statutory scheme?  \nSee City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 662 (explaining that “[a]t bottom, the dissent differs \nwith us only over the question whether the new ordinance is sufficiently similar to the \nrepealed ordinance that it is permissible to say that the challenged conduct continues”).  To \nanswer that question, we must identify the crux of the underlying suit and compare the \nrelief requested with the relief provided by the allegedly mooting statutory change.  See id. \n(“The gravamen of petitioner’s complaint is that its members are disadvantaged in their \n \ncouncil then repeals its ordinance and replaces it with a new one requiring \napproval only if the editorial concerns one particular city program, would \nthat render the pending lawsuit moot and require the paper to commence a \nnew one? \n \nOr take this example.  A State enacts a law providing that any woman \nwishing to obtain an abortion must submit certification from five doctors that \nthe procedure is medically necessary.  After a woman sues, claiming that any \nrequirement of physician certification is unconstitutional, the State replaces \nits old law with a new one requiring certification by three physicians.  Would \nthe court be required to dismiss the woman’s suit?  Suppose the court, \nfollowing the precedent set by today’s decision, holds that the case is moot, \nand suppose that the woman brings a second case challenging the new law \non the same ground.  If the State repeals that law and replaces it with one \nrequiring certification by two doctors, would the second suit be moot?  And \nwhat if the State responds to a third suit by enacting replacement legislation \ndemanding certification by one doctor? \n \nId. at 1539–40 (Alito, J., dissenting).  Of course, the New York State Rifle dissenters also \nargued that the amended legislation at issue in that case “reduce[d] but d[id] not eliminate \nthe injury originally alleged” based on plaintiffs’ use of the phrase “unrestricted access” in \ntheir complaint—an argument the majority rejected.  Id. at 1540.  As I have explained, this \ncase is distinguishable because plaintiffs requested an end to at-large voting for City \nCouncil elections in Virginia Beach and HB 2198 fails to give them that “precise relief.”  \n29 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 30 of 64\n \nefforts to obtain city contracts . . . . [I]nsofar as [the new ordinance] accords preferential \ntreatment to [B]lack- and female-owned contractors[,] . . . it disadvantages [petitioners] in \nthe same fundamental way.”); see also N.Y. State Rifle, 140 S. Ct. at 1526 (finding \nmootness where petitioners received “the precise relief [they] requested in the prayer for \nrelief in their complaint”). \nThe gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint is that the at-large feature of the electoral \nscheme for Virginia Beach’s ten (nonmayoral) City Council seats has “interact[ed] with \nsocial and historical conditions” in the City and resulted in Minority Voters having “less \nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and \nto elect representatives of their choice.” 8  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 47, 75 (1986) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b)).  Plaintiffs’ allegations refer generally and repeatedly to the \nCity’s “at-large method of election.”  And plaintiffs sought to challenge the at-large \nelection of all ten (nonmayoral) seats—not solely those with residency districts.  For \n \n8 The majority, however, argues that plaintiffs’ challenge must be limited to the \nparticular electoral system which employed at-large voting for all ten seats and residency \ndistricts for seven seats—not to the use of “any at-large voting in City Council elections,” \nante, at 12—because finding otherwise would violate the congressional mandate that “there \nis nothing, per se, unlawful about at-large elections system[s].”  S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 68 \n(1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 246.  But plaintiffs’ challenge is not to at-\nlarge voting in the abstract but rather to at-large voting for City Council members in \nVirginia Beach which plaintiffs alleged, and the district court found, has “interact[ed] with \nsocial and historical conditions” such that minority voters have “less opportunity than other \nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives \nof their choice.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47, 75 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b)); see also S.J.A. \n247 (“[T]he degree to which an at-large district diluted minority voting in Virginia Beach \nwas a central element of the Court’s finding that the previous map (with three at-large \ndistricts and seven districts voting at-large but with a residency requirement for candidates) \nviolated the Voting Rights Act.”). \n30 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 31 of 64\n \nexample, plaintiffs alleged that “[t]he consistent defeat of minority preferred candidates \nwould not occur if the City Council were elected using ten single-member voting districts” \nand  that  “Virginia  Beach’s  minority  population  is  sufficiently  numerous  and \ngeographically compact to form a majority of the total population and citizen voting age \npopulation in at least two single-member City Council districts in a demonstrative 10-\ndistrict plan.”  J.A. 55 (emphasis added).  Indeed, the introduction to plaintiffs’ amended \ncomplaint described their request for injunctive relief as one for “an injunction against the \nfurther use of at-large elections for the City Council.”  J.A. 48–49 (emphasis added). \nThat plaintiffs would draft their complaint in this way makes sense in the context of \nGingles.  The quintessential Gingles suit challenges alleged vote dilution through the use \nof multi-member districts or an at-large electoral scheme.9  See, e.g., id. at 42, 46–51; \nMcGhee v. Granville Cnty., 860 F.2d 110, 116–17 (4th Cir. 1988).  In Gingles, the Court \nconsidered whether a  three-judge district court had correctly held that “the  use in a \nlegislative redistricting plan of multimember districts in five North Carolina legislative \ndistricts violated § 2.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 34.  The Gingles Court first found that the \n1982 congressional amendments to Section 2 had “deliberately codified” “the dilution \n \n9 While the Supreme Court has now also applied the Gingles preconditions in vote \ndilution claims challenging single-member districts, such as where vote fragmentation is \nat issue, it explained that it did so because “[i]t would be peculiar to conclude that a vote-\ndilution challenge to the (more dangerous) multimember district requires a higher threshold \nshowing than a vote-fragmentation challenge to a single-member district.”  Growe v. \nEmison, 507 U.S. 25, 40 (1993) (“We have . . . stated on many occasions that multimember \ndistricting plans, as well as at-large plans, generally pose greater threats to minority-voter \nparticipation in the political process than do single-member districts.”). \n31 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 32 of 64\n \nconcept.”10  McGhee, 860 F.2d at 117.  The Gingles Court next sought to reconcile \nCongress’s adoption of a results test11 for vote dilution claims under Section 2 with the \nexpress limitations it placed on such claims, namely that at-large elections “may not be \nconsidered per se violative of § 2” and that “the conjunction of an allegedly dilutive \nelectoral mechanism and the lack of  proportional representation  does not establish a \nviolation.”12  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46.  The Gingles Court, therefore, found that three \n \n10 “Section 2 prohibits all forms of voting discrimination, not just vote dilution.”  \nGingles,  478  U.S.  at  45  n.10.    But  the  Supreme  Court  “has  long  recognized  that \nmultimember districts and at-large voting schemes may ‘operate to minimize or cancel out \nthe voting strength of racial [minorities in] the voting population.’”  Id. at 47 (quoting \nBurns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 88 (1966)).  The concept underlying such claims “is that \nracial minorities may not have their group power impermissibly ‘diluted’ by multimember \ndistricting or at-large electoral processes which ‘submerge’ the minority group in a voting \nconstituency in which the voting power of a racially ‘bloc-voting’ white majority always \ninsures defeat for the candidates of the minority group’s choice.”  McGhee, 860 F.2d at \n116 (citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46).  As we have previously recognized, vote dilution “is \na distinctive way which in recent times, with the gradual eradication of most of the more \ndirect historical forms of outright denials or subversions of voting power and access \nitself—literacy  tests,  poll  taxes,  anti-single  shot  laws  and  the  like—has  become  the \ndominant remaining means of voting rights violations, and hence the most frequent focus \nof contemporary legal challenges.”  Id. (noting also that vote dilution is “more subtle” than \nthe “more brutally direct formal devices now largely of the past”). \n11 The Supreme Court held in 1980, in Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980), that a \nshowing of purposeful discrimination was required to sustain a Section 2 claim.  Prior to \nBolden, courts had generally considered whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a \nchallenged election practice “operated to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of a \nracial group.”  McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist., 851 F.2d 937, 940 (7th Cir. 1988); see \nalso Gingles, 478 U.S. at 35.  In amending Section 2 in 1982, Congress overturned the \n“intent” test and instead codified the pre-Bolden “results” test.  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 35. \n12 Congress was concerned that “without adequate legal constraints upon judicial \ndiscretion to find and remedy mere vote dilution ‘results,’ the inevitable consequence \nwould be a proportional representation approach.”  McGhee, 860 F.2d at 117.  Thus, \n(Continued) \n \n32 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 33 of 64\n \ncircumstances  were  “necessary  preconditions  for  multimember  districts  to  operate  to \nimpair minority voters’ ability to elect representatives of their choice”:  the minority group \nmust be able to show that 1) “it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to \nconstitute a majority in a single-member district,” 2) “it is politically cohesive [and],” 3) \n“the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the \nminority’s preferred candidate.”  Id. at 50–51; see also McGhee, 860 F.2d at 117 (“The \njudicial and legislative process of putting principled bounds upon the vote dilution concept \nhas now culminated in the Supreme Court’s exhaustive analysis [in Gingles] of the concept \nas codified . . . [, including] find[ing] in it three threshold proof requirements.”). \nThe Gingles Court explained that unless the first precondition is met, the “multi-\nmember form of the district cannot be responsible for minority voters’ inability to elect its \ncandidates” because minority voters must “possess the potential to elect representatives in \nthe absence of the challenged structure or practice.”13  Id. at 50 & n.17 (explaining further \n \nCongress added a proviso to Section 2(b), the “Dole Compromise” proviso, which states \n“[t]hat nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class \nelected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.”  8 U.S.C. § 1973(b).  The \nSenate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments also stressed that “there is nothing, per \nse, unlawful about at-large elections system. [sic] only when such systems operate, in the \ncontext of other objective factors and the totality of the circumstances, to effectively deny \nmembers of a minority group the opportunity to participate equally in the process, is a \nviolation established.”  S.

Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 455 (5th Cir. 1989) \n(explaining that the “at-large feature of the election system, by itself, cannot be said to \nviolate Section 2” unless the minority is “assured the power to elect representatives of its \nchoice” under “a single-member districting plan”).  And the Court elaborated that “[t]he \nsingle-member district is generally the appropriate standard against which to measure \nminority group potential to elect because it is the smallest political unit from which \nrepresentatives are elected.”  Id. at 50 n.17. \nThus, as we have previously recognized, \nimplicit in the Gingles Court’s analysis of the nature of § 2 vote dilution \nclaims is the notion that, so far as those claims are concerned, right and \nremedy  are  inextricably  bound  together,  for  to  prove  vote  dilution  by \ndistricting  one  must  prove  the  specific  way  in  which  dilution  may  be \nremedied by redistricting. \n \n \nimpedes its ability to elect its chosen representatives.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51; see also \nGrowe, 507 U.S. at 40 (“The ‘geographically compact majority’ and ‘minority political \ncohesion’ showings are needed to establish that the minority has the potential to elect a \nrepresentative of its own choice in some single-member district.   And the ‘minority \npolitical cohesion’ and ‘majority bloc voting’ showings are needed to establish that the \nchallenged districting thwarts a distinctive minority vote by submerging it in a larger white \nvoting population.” (citation omitted)). \n34 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 35 of 64\n \nMcGhee, 860 F.2d at 120 (emphasis added); see also Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40–\n41 (1993) (“Unless these [Gingles preconditions] are established, there neither has been a \nwrong nor can be a remedy.”); Hines v. Mayor & Town Council of Ahoskie, 998 F.2d 1266, \n1273 (4th Cir. 1993) (citing McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist., 851 F.2d 937, 942–43 (7th \nCir. 1988)). \nPlaintiffs here followed the dictates of Gingles and compared Virginia Beach’s at-\nlarge electoral system with an illustrative plan composed of ten14 single-member districts \ndrawn in such a way that the minority citizen voting age population composed a majority \nin two.15  J.A. 55; see also Gingles, at 51 n.17; Collins v. City of Norfolk, 883 F.2d 1232, \n1237 (4th Cir. 1989).  Because this comparison is the basis of plaintiffs’ alleged injury, \nplaintiffs challenge was to at-large voting for all ten (nonmayoral) City Council districts. \n \n14 We have previously explained that federal courts should defer to legislative \nchoices regarding the proper size of a legislative body and, therefore, “[a]ctionable vote \ndilution must be measured against the number of positions in the existing governmental \nbody rather than some hypothetical model based upon whatever size is necessary to \naccomplish proportional representation.”  Hines v. Mayor & Town Council of Ahoskie, 998 \nF.2d 1266, 1271 (4th Cir. 1993) (quoting Overton v. City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529, 543 (5th \nCir. 1989) (Jones, J., concurring)).  Relying on the existing number of seats as the proper \nyardstick also ensures that plaintiffs cannot “create a voting right violation where none \npresently exist” by “[a]dding seats to the boards” to enable them to meet the first prong of \nGingles.  McNeil, 851 F.2d at 946. \n15 Notably, plaintiffs’ expert tasked with designing this illustrative plan compared \nits boundaries to those of the City Council’s residency plan and provided Census data \nshowing that the minority citizen voting age population did not form a majority in any of \nthe existing residency districts.  J.A. 1369–76; J.A. 1379–86; J.A. 1413 (“The current City \nCouncil  plan  has  zero  majority  [minority]  combined  [citizen  voting  age  population] \ndistricts.”);  see  also  Holloway, 531  F.  Supp.  3d  at  1058  (“Mr.  Fairfax  drew  up ten \nillustrative plans and . . . compared [them] to the current City Council Seven District \nResidency Plan . . . .”). \n35 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 36 of 64\n \nThe majority stresses that this case is moot, however, because under the “flexible” \nand “fact-intensive” totality-of-the-circumstances analysis required to prove a violation of \nSection 2, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46,16 plaintiffs and the district court “focus[ed] on the \nhistory and effects of [the] particular electoral system that uniquely required all candidates \nto run at-large and most candidates to do so from especially problematic designated \ndistricts,” ante, at 17.  But it cannot be that a change to any aspect of an electoral system, \nrenders a VRA challenge to that system moot simply because of the wholistic and fact-\nbased nature of the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.17  Indeed, such a rule would \n \n16 As the Gingles Court explained, even if plaintiffs can satisfy the three necessary \npreconditions, they must still demonstrate—as with any Section 2 violation—that, under \nthe totality of the circumstances, the challenged “electoral structure operates to minimize \nor cancel out their ability to elect their preferred candidates.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48 (citing \nS. Rep. No. 97-417, at 16 (1982), as reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 193); see also \nDe Grandy v. Johnson, 512 U.S. 997, 1009–13, 1012 n.10 (1994).  Although, “several of \nour  sister  circuits  have  acknowledged  that  where  a  plaintiff  establishes  the  Gingles \nprerequisites, that plaintiff is likely to succeed under the totality of the circumstances.”  \nBaten v. McMaster, 967 F.3d 345, 379 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (July 27, 2020) (Wynn, \nJ., dissenting) (collecting cases); see also Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol. Sch. Dist. Bd. of \nEduc., 4 F.3d 1103, 1116 n.6 (3d Cir. 1993) (“[I]t would be a highly unusual case in which \na plaintiff successfully proved the existence of the three Gingles factors and still failed to \nestablish a violation.”). \n \nIn determining what “proof [is] required to establish [Section 2] violations,” the \nSenate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to Section 2 identified nine factors \nrelevant to the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 43–45.  The \nGingles  Court,  however,  emphasized  that  this  “list  of  typical  factors  is  neither \ncomprehensive nor exclusive. . . . [and that] there is no requirement that any particular \nnumber of factors be proved, or that a majority of them point one way or the other.”  Id. at \n45. \n17 If this were the test, then even changes that increased rather than lessened the \nalleged harm would moot the suit.  See generally Montana Green Party v. Jacobsen, 17 \n(Continued) \n \n36 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 37 of 64\n \nswallow our mootness jurisprudence and deprive us of jurisdiction following even the most \nminor statutory changes. \nFor example, we have previously recognized that the use of staggered terms may \n“enhance” the dilutive effect of at-large electoral schemes.  City of Norfolk, 883 F.2d at \n1236.  And, indeed, in this case, the district court explained as part of its totality-of-the-\ncircumstances analysis that the City’s use of staggered terms18 “promoted the dilution of \nminority voting strength” by “minimiz[ing]  the influence  of single-shot voting” and, \ntherefore, that the City’s use of staggered terms provided evidence that the “third factor”—\nthe “extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election \ndistricts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting practices \nand  procedures  that  may  enhance  the  opportunity  for  discrimination”—was  met.  \nHolloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1084–85.  Yet, if the Virginia General Assembly had passed \nlegislation prohibiting the use of staggered terms in City Council elections—instead of HB \n2198—that change alone could certainly not have provided plaintiffs with sufficient relief \nto render this case moot. \n \nF.4th  919,  922  (9th  Cir.  2021)  (finding  a  case  not  moot  where  “the  amended  law \ndisadvantages Plaintiffs to a slightly greater degree than the previous law”). \n18 The City’s use of staggered terms is relevant to the three at-large seats without \nresidency districts and, therefore, its relevance is unchanged by HB 2198. \n37 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 38 of 64\n \nSimilarly, here, while the district court examined the City’s use of residency districts \nand its use of at-large voting for all, rather than some, of its Council seats, 19 the elimination \n \n19 For example, when considering the third factor, the court found that there was \nevidence that Virginia Beach had an anti-single shot system because by combining at-large \nvoting  with  residency  districts,  the  City  effectively  prevented  minorities  from \nconcentrating their vote behind a limited number of candidates and, therefore, “enhance[d] \nthe dilutive effect of at-large elections.”   Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1084.  But this was \nonly one part of the court’s analysis under the third factor.  The court also noted that the \nuse of staggered terms for City Council elections functioned to prevent single-shot voting.  \nAnd the court highlighted another, separate, reason that it found the third factor met:  the \n“unusually large election districts” at issue.  Id.  As the court explained, “[i]n Virginia \nBeach, minority candidates running for the at-large seats are expected to campaign across \n249 miles which requires immense resources.”  Id.  At 249 square miles, the City is \n“essentially tied for second” in Virginia “in the size of the area candidates must traverse to \nwin a city council position.”  Id.  The court stressed the intrinsic concerns present with \ngeographically large election districts, including that “given structural socioeconomic and \nsocial  disadvantages  that  minority  communities  face,  at-large  districts  heavily \ndisadvantage minority candidates because [they] ‘are likely to have less access to the \nnecessary resources for travel and advertising’ outside the immediate area surrounding the \ncandidates’ homes.”  Id.  See generally United States v. Charleston Cnty., S.C., 365 F.3d \n341, 352 (4th Cir. 2004) (noting that the County’s large size “work[ed] to the detriment of \nminority candidates, who typically have fewer financial resources, in particular because \ncostly television advertising and direct mail have proven important in recent Council \nelections”).  Additionally, the court noted that Virginia Beach’s population of 450,000 is \nthe largest in Virginia and, therefore, “the City has the largest electorate for which a \ncandidate must compete.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1084.  Indeed, Virginia Beach’s \npopulation is twice that of the next largest city:  Norfolk.  Finally, the court highlighted \nthat, under one of the illustrative plans proposed by plaintiffs, “the mean district sizes \nwould be 24.9 square miles, reducing the area for electoral competition by 90 percent.”  Id. \n \nFurther, when considering the ninth factor—“whether the policy underlying the \nstate or political subdivision’s use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or \nstandard, practice or procedure is tenuous”—the court noted that none of the twelve other \ncities in Virginia with populations above 50,000 “share[] Virginia Beach’s combination of \nat-large elections, designated seats for most positions, and staggered terms” and that the \nCity “ha[d] not proffered a reasonable explanation for designing such a system.”  Id. at \n1102.  But the core of the court’s finding under this factor was that the City had “not offered \na credible and reasonable justification for maintaining its at-large electoral system”—an \n(Continued) \n \n38 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 39 of 64\n \nof  these  electoral  features  does  not  ipso  facto  render  the  court’s  totality-of-the \ncircumstances analysis groundless.  As the Gingles Court explained, a court need not find \nthat every Senate factor weighs in favor of a Section 2 violation.  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 \n(“[T]his list of typical factors [considered] is neither comprehensive nor exclusive. . . . \n[and] there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved, or that a \nmajority of them point one way or the other.”); see also S. Rep. 97-417, at 239 (1982), as \nreprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 410 (“The courts ordinarily have not used these \nfactors, nor does the committee intend them to be used, as a mechanical ‘point counting’ \ndevice.”).  And some factors are more important than others in the context of a vote dilution \nchallenge to at-large or multimember districts.  Id. at 48 n.15.  Notably, the use of “electoral \ndevices which enhance the dilutive effects of multimember districts” such as unusually \nlarge election districts or anti-single shot provisions “are supportive of, but not essential \nto” a Section 2 challenge to at-large voting.  Id. (emphasis removed). \nHere, the district court went above and beyond what is required; it considered all \nnine of the Senate factors and found that each one weighed in favor of finding a Section 2 \nviolation.  Thus, even if one—or several—factors no longer weigh in favor of finding a \n \nabsence which was particularly egregious given that “the Minority Community ha[d] \nadvocated for decades for the City to change the at-large district [system].”  Id. at 1101–\n02.  In any case, as the court explained, where a “procedure markedly departs from . . . \npractices elsewhere in the jurisdiction, that bears on the fairness of its impact.  But even a \nconsistently applied practice premised on a racially neutral policy would not negate a \nplaintiff’s showing through other factors that the challenged practice denies minorities fair \naccess to the process.”  Id. at 1102 n.45 (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29 n.117 (1982), as \nreprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 207 n.117). \n39 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 40 of 64\n \nSection 2 violation, that does not necessarily undermine the court’s conclusion.  See United \nStates v. Charleston Cnty., S.C., 365 F.3d 341, 353 (4th Cir. 2004). \nAnd, in this case, I do not find that the district court’s totality-of-the-circumstances \nanalysis hinged on the City’s prior use of residency districts or the fact that all—instead of \nsome—of its districts were elected at-large.  Rather, at the core of the district court’s \ntotality-of-the-circumstances analysis was the determination that at-large voting for City \nCouncil members in Virginia Beach has “interact[ed] with social and historical conditions” \nin Virginia Beach to deny minority voters an equal opportunity “to participate in the \npolitical process and elect representatives of their choice.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47, 75 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b)); cf. ante, at 17 (acknowledging that “the district court did \nassess the general effects of at-large voting in Virginia Beach”).  Indeed, during the \nremedial phase of this litigation, the Special Master likewise explained that an electoral \nscheme which “retain[ed] an at-large feature for some of [the City Council] districts” would \nnot remedy plaintiffs’ injury because “the degree to which an at-large district diluted \nminority voting in Virginia Beach was a central element of the Court’s finding that the \nprevious map (with three at-large districts and seven districts voting at-large but with a \nresidency  requirement  for  candidates)  violated  the  Voting  Rights  Act.”    S.J.A.  247 \n(emphasis added). \nE. \nHaving determined that the core of plaintiffs’ challenge is to the use of at-large \nvoting by the City of Virginia Beach for its (non-mayoral) City Council seats, I next \nconsider whether HB 2198 nevertheless provides a sufficient remedy to moot this suit.  In \n40 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 41 of 64\n \nconsidering the scope of relief that may be granted to plaintiffs if they prevail and reaching \nthe conclusion that plaintiffs’ suit remains  live, I am informed by our jurisprudence \nregarding remedies in the context of voting rights challenges to electoral processes and \ndistricting schemes. \nIn discussing the proper judicial remedy for Section 2 violations, the Senate Report \naccompanying the 1982 amendments stated that: \nThe court should exercise its traditional equitable powers to fashion the relief \nso that it completely remedies the prior dilution of minority voting strength \nand fully provides equal opportunity for minority citizens to participate and \nto elect candidates of their choice. \n \nS. Rep. No. 97-417, at 31 (emphases added).  Although the Report does not “define the \nstandard  against  which  ‘completeness’  of  the  remedy  is  to  be  measured,”  we  have \npreviously recognized the “principle[]” derived from Section 2 and Gingles that “[i]f a vote \ndilution violation is established, the appropriate remedy is to restructure the districting \nsystem  to  eradicate,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  by  that  means,  the  dilution \nproximately caused by that system.”  McGhee, 860 F.2d at 118 & n.8 (first emphasis \nadded). \nIn McGhee, both parties stipulated that Granville County’s at-large electoral system \nwith staggered terms for its Board of Supervisors violated Section 2.  McGhee, 860 F.2d at \n112–13.  After receiving remedial proposals from both parties, the district court adopted a \nversion of plaintiffs’ “limited voting plan” which called for the simultaneous at-large \nelection of all  Supervisors—with each voter entitled to vote for  a maximum  of two \ncandidates.  Id. at 114.  We reversed the district court and instead approved the remedial \n41 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 42 of 64\n \n“single member district electoral plan” proposed by the County even though, despite \nmaking up more than 40 percent of the voting age population, Black voters were “likely \ng[iven] . . . a chance to elect only one commissioner (14% [of the board])” under the plan.  \nId. at 114.  We explained that, under Gingles, “[t]he maximum extent to which a particular \ndilution violation may be remedied by restructuring the districting system is constrained \nby the size, compactness, and cohesion elements of the dilution concept,” id. at 118, and \nplaintiffs had conceded that it was “not possible to draw a five or seven single member \ndistrict plan that gives [B]lack voters any better opportunity to elect representatives of their \nchoice,” id. at 113.  We, therefore, found that the County’s proposed single-member district \nremedial plan was a “complete” remedy because it afforded “the maximum remedy possible \nby redistricting”—the means at the heart of a dilution claim.20  Id. at 118 (emphases added). \nThe Supreme Court has also repeatedly reaffirmed that single-member districts are \nthe preferred judicial remedy in the voting rights context.  E.g., Growe, 507 U.S. at 40 \n(explaining that the Supreme Court has “stated on many occasions that multimember \ndistricting plans, as well as at-large plans, generally pose greater threats to minority-voter \nparticipation in the political process than do single-member districts, which is why we have \nstrongly  preferred  single-member  districts  for  federal-court-ordered  reapportionment” \n \n20 In adopting plaintiffs’ limited voting plan, we found that the district court had \nimpermissibly sought “to eradicate the dilution by altering other ‘electoral laws, practices, \nand structures’ that were not actually challenged by the claim as made.”  McGhee, 860 F.2d \nat 118.  Because the “violation established was vote dilution specifically caused by an at-\nlarge electoral scheme,” a single-member district plan was the “appropriate remedy.”  Id. \nat 118–19. \n42 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 43 of 64\n \n(citations  omitted));  Wise  v.  Lipscomb,  437  U.S.  535,  540  (1978)  (“Among  other \nrequirements, a court-drawn plan should prefer single-member districts over multimember \ndistricts, absent persuasive justification to the contrary.  We have repeatedly reaffirmed \nthis remedial principle.” (citations omitted)); Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 26–27 (“We \nhold  today  that  unless  there  are  persausive  [sic]  justifications,  a  court-ordered \nreapportionment plan of a state legislature must avoid use of multimember districts.”). \nIn sum, the “complete” judicial remedy for a voting dilution injury based on at-large \nvoting, is a single-member district plan with its boundaries drawn to ensure the harmed \nminority group is provided an equal opportunity to elect representatives of its choice.  And, \nin fact, at the remedial stage, the district court adopted the Special Master Plan, which \nconsists of a ten-seat single-member district system drawn to permit three opportunity-to-\nelect seats for minority voters.  Defendants had proposed two remedial “concept plans”—\na 7-3 plan and a 10-district plan—both of which the Special Master rejected as insufficient \nto remedy the Section 2 violation found by the district court.  S.J.A. 52–53; S.J.A. 243–\n256.  Notably, even the 7-3 remedial plan proposed by defendants did not retain at-large \nvoting for any of the (non-mayoral) City Council seats and was instead composed of seven \nsingle-member districts and three single-member “super wards.”   S.J.A. 52 (“In this \nsystem, every resident in Virginia Beach would be represented by one district seat, one \nsuper ward seat, and the mayor.”).  Indeed, as the Special Master explained, “retain[ing] \nan at-large feature for some of [the City’s] districts”21 would fail to correct the City’s \n \n21 The  Special  Master  appears  to have  incorrectly  interpreted the  7-3  plan  as \nretaining an at-large feature for the three super ward seats.  S.J.A. 247. \n43 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 44 of 64\n \nSection 2 violation because “the degree to which an at-large district diluted minority voting \nin Virginia Beach was a central element of the Court’s finding that the previous map (with \nthree at-large districts and seven districts voting at-large but with a residency requirement \nfor candidates) violated the Voting Rights Act.”  S.J.A. 247. \nThus, I do not find that plaintiffs have been granted effectual or precise relief by \nlegislation that prevents the use of at-large voting for only some of the City’s Council seats \nand without regard to the boundaries of those districts. \nThe majority notes that we previously recognized that a Section 2 challenge became \nmoot in an identical scenario, albeit in an unpublished case.  In NAACP v. Winston-\nSalem/Forsyth County Board of Education, No. 91–1222, 1992 WL 64875, at *1 (4th Cir. \nApr. 3, 1992) (unpublished table decision), we acknowledged that a challenge to an \nelectoral system for the County’s Board of Education members was mooted by the passage \nof a state law.  Under the former system, the Board’s nine members were all elected at-\nlarge to staggered terms.  Id.  After plaintiffs filed suit against the Board challenging the \nsystem, the state legislature passed a bill adopting a “2-4-3 plan” made up of “a two-\nmember  majority  [B]lack  district,  a  four-member  majority  white  district,  and  three \nmembers elected at-large” with all members elected concurrently.  Id.  The “2-4-3 plan” \ndid not merely involve a shift from nine at-large seats to six single-district and three at-\nlarge seats but also included the boundaries of the six new single-member districts.  See id. \nat *1–2.  Notably, the 2-4-3 plan “had previously been proposed by plaintiffs” during \nsettlement negotiations.  Id. at *2 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Winston-Salem plaintiffs \ndid not argue that they had not received complete relief.  See id.  In fact, the issue we \n44 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 45 of 64\n \nconsidered in that case was whether the district court erred in denying plaintiffs’ request \nfor a declaration that they were “prevailing parties” based on the relief received by the \n2-4-3 plan.  Id.  We affirmed the district court’s dismissal with prejudice and found that \nplaintiffs were not prevailing parties because the state legislature—not the Board—had \nadopted the 2-4-3 plan mooting the controversy.  Id. (“In the absence of evidence of a \ncatalytic action by plaintiffs bringing [the mooting legislation] into being, there is at most \nunverified suspicion, but no evidence, that the plaintiffs ‘contributed in a significant way’ \nand thus were prevailing parties.”).  Thus, in Winston-Salem, we did not find that a statutory \nchange that results in “some of the members” of a governing body being elected in single-\nmember districts provided sufficient relief to moot a challenge to an all at-large electoral \nsystem.  Rather, the undisputed mootness of plaintiffs’ suit was due to the “relief” “give[n]” \nto plaintiffs in that case, which was identical to relief they had requested.  Id. at *1–2. \nIn conclusion, the enactment of HB 2198 neither addresses the entirety of the \nremedy sought by the plaintiffs nor the wrongs found by the district court.  Thus, I would \nfind that HB 2198 does not moot this suit. \n \nII. \n \nBecause I would not find this case moot, I also reach the City’s other jurisdictional \nargument that plaintiffs, two Black voters, lack standing because they improperly seek to \nassert the rights of Hispanic and Asian voters in the City by bringing a coalition claim.  It \nis true that, ordinarily, a litigant “must assert his own legal rights and interests and cannot \nrest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”  U.S. Dep’t of Lab. \n45 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 46 of 64\n \nv. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 721 (1990) (citing Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United \nfor Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474 (1982)).  But in invoking the \nthird-party standing doctrine here, the City overlooks the text of the VRA and misconstrues \nthe nature of plaintiffs’ claims. \nUnder the City’s theory, plaintiffs alleging a coalition claim under the VRA lack \nstanding unless a representative from each minority group alleged to be part of the coalition \nis present.  In arguing that plaintiffs seek to assert the rights of Hispanic and Asian voters \nby bringing a coalition claim, however, the City conflates the standing and mootness \ninquiries.  See Kumar v. Frisco Indep. Sch. Dist., 476 F. Supp. 3d 439, 463 (E.D. Tex. \n2020) (noting the “tension that Gingles and the third-party standing doctrine may elicit” \nbut finding the two legal doctrines distinguishable). \nThe VRA provides that “an aggrieved person” may bring suit under the Act.22  52 \nU.S.C.  § 10302.    Thus,  the  statute  does  not  require  a  class  action  and  expressly \ncontemplates that a sole plaintiff may bring a VRA challenge.  See Kumar, 476 F. Supp. \n3d at 460–61 (“A class action is not mandated by the text.  Moreover, the Court is unaware \nof any authority which prohibits individual representation in a Voting Rights Act case.”). \n \n22 Initially, only the Attorney General had standing to enforce the VRA.  Then, in \nAllen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 557 (1969), the Supreme Court extended \nstanding  to  “private  citizens  . . .  seek[ing]  judicial  enforcement  of  the  prohibition.”  \nCongress later amended the VRA to expressly provide “aggrieved person[s]” with standing \nto enforce the Act.  See Roberts v. Wamser, 883 F.2d 617, 621 (8th Cir. 1989); 52 U.S.C. \n§ 10302. \n46 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 47 of 64\n \nPlaintiffs allege that they are personally aggrieved because, as Black voters in the \nCity, their votes are diluted by the use of at-large voting for City Council seats in violation \nof Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  J.A. 49, 51–52.  In bringing this suit, therefore, \nplaintiffs assert only their own rights.23  Indeed, they do not assert the rights of non-party \nHispanic and Asian voters any more than they assert the rights of non-party Black voters.  \nInstead, the cohesiveness of the alleged coalition of Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters in \nVirginia Beach (“the Minority Community”) is relevant to the Gingles framework—the \nevidentiary vehicle through which plaintiffs seek to prove their claim.  See Kumar, 476 F. \nSupp. 3d at 463 (explaining that “[t]he Gingles framework sets out a threshold evidentiary \nburden, not a proxy test for standing”). \nThus, I would affirm the district court’s finding that plaintiffs have standing. \n \nIII. \nThe district court also found that plaintiffs had successfully proved a Section 2 \nclaim.  First, the district court found that plaintiffs had established each of the Gingles \npreconditions.  The district court then found that plaintiffs had shown that, under the \ntotality of the circumstances, the Minority Community “has less opportunity than other \nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process and elect their preferred \n \n23 In this way, this case is distinguishable from Nordgren v. Hafter, 789 F.2d 334 \n(5th Cir. 1986), cited by the City, which found that “a white Jewish female . . . cannot \nsuccessfully assert standing on behalf of aggrieved [B]lack applicants to the Mississippi \nbar.  She is not their representative.”  Id. at 338 (emphasis added). \n47 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 48 of 64\n \ncandidates.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1080.  “[W]e may set aside a trial court’s finding \nof vote dilution only if it is clearly erroneous.”  Charleston Cnty., 365 F.3d at 349. \nA. \nOn appeal, the City argues that the district court erred in finding any of the three \nGingles preconditions met. \ni. \nThe district court found that plaintiffs had satisfied the first Gingles precondition \nbecause they had demonstrated that the Minority Community was sufficiently large and \ngeographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the district court considered evidence presented by \nplaintiffs’ expert witness, Anthony Fairfax, of ten illustrative plans, each drawn with one \nor two districts in which the Minority Community would make up a majority of the citizen \nvoting age population.  The court credited Mr. Fairfax as “a credible expert witness” and \nfound that in drawing the illustrative districts, he had “properly used the five common \nredistricting criteria:  equal population, contiguity, compactness, minimization of political \nsubdivision splits of Voter Tabulation Districts (‘VTDs’), and preservation of communities \nof interest.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1057–58.  “[O]ur function is not to reweigh the \nevidence presented to the district court.”  Charleston Cnty., 365 F.3d at 349.  And I do not \nfind that the district court clearly erred in reaching this conclusion. \nThe City objects, however, that the district court committed legal error in permitting \nplaintiffs to rely on a coalition of Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters in Virginia Beach to \nprove their claim.  We have not yet decided whether such “coalition claims” are permissible \n48 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 49 of 64\n \nto prove a Section 2 violation, and the Supreme Court has expressly reserved the question.24  \nBartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 13–14 (2009) (“We do not address that type of coalition \ndistrict here.”); see also Growe, 507 U.S. at 41 (“Assuming (without deciding) that it was \npermissible for the District Court to combine distinct ethnic and language minority groups \nfor purposes of assessing compliance with § 2, . . .”).  But many of our sister circuits have \nexpressly accepted or assumed that minority coalitions are cognizable for Section 2 claims.  \nSee Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1988); Concerned Citizens \nof Hardee Cnty. v. Hardee Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 906 F.2d 524, 526 (11th Cir. 1990); \nBadillo v. City of Stockton, 956 F.2d 884 (9th Cir. 1992); Bridgeport Coal. for Fair \nRepresentation v. City of Bridgeport, 26 F.3d 271 (2d Cir. 1994).  But see Nixon v. Kent \nCnty., 76 F.3d 1381, 1386–87 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc). \nThe district court found that plaintiffs could bring a coalition claim here because \nsuch claims are “consistent with the language and the purpose of the VRA.”  Holloway, \n531 F. Supp. 3d at 1053.  We review such legal determinations de novo.  Raleigh Wake \nCitizens Ass’n v. Wake Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 827 F.3d 333, 340 (4th Cir. 2016). \nSection 2(a) of the VRA prohibits any voting standard or practice that “results in a \ndenial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of \nrace and color,” or language-minority status.  52 U.S.C. §§ 10301(a), 10303(f).  Section \n \n24 Coalition claims are distinct from cross-over claims, which we, and the Supreme \nCourt, have previously rejected.  Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421, 431 (4th Cir. 2004); see \nalso Bartlett, 556 U.S. 1.  Cross-over claims are those involving “communities in which \nminority citizens are able to form coalitions” with white voters.  Hall, 385 F.3d at 431. \n49 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 50 of 64\n \n2(b) then sets forth how to establish a violation of Section 2(a) and explains that the \nprovision applies to “members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a).”  Id. at \n§ 10301(b).  Employing a plain reading of the text, the district court found that the VRA \ndoes not require each member of the “class” referenced in Section 2(b) “to be of the same \nrace, color, or language minority status.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1053.  Rather, the \nmembers of the “class” must “share the common trait of being denied the right to vote \nbased on their race, color, or language,” id., or, in other words, of being “protected by \nsubsection (a).”  52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). \nThe City, however, invokes the reasoning of our colleagues on the Sixth Circuit who \nhave rejected coalition claims because “§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not mention \nminority coalitions” and because “§ 2 consistently speaks of a ‘class’ in the singular.”  \nNixon, 76 F.3d at 1386.  In Nixon, the Sixth Circuit found that “[i]f Congress had intended \nto sanction coalition suits, the statute would read ‘participation by members of the classes \nof citizens protected by subsection (a)’” or, alternatively, omit the term “class” altogether.  \nId. (emphasis added). \nThe City also stresses that Section 2 requires a comparison between the ability of \nmembers of a singular “class” and “other members of the electorate to participate in the \npolitical process and to elect representatives of their choice.”  52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).  The \nprovision, it argues, therefore requires a contrast between members of a discrete minority \ngroup (the protected “class”) and, not only white voters, but also voters from other minority \ngroups. \n50 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 51 of 64\n \nLike the district court, and nearly every other circuit to consider the issue, I am \npersuaded that Section 2 encompasses coalition claims like the one brought by plaintiffs \nhere.  First, the absence of any express reference to coalition claims in the text of Section \n2 is not dispositive to our interpretation of the provision.  See generally Bostock v. Clayton \nCnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1747 (2020) (“[T]here [is no] such thing as a ‘canon of donut holes,’ \nin which Congress’s failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls within a more \ngeneral statutory rule creates a tacit exception.”).  Black’s Law Dictionary 284 (9th ed. \n2009) defines “class” as “[a] group of people . . . that have common characteristics or \nattributes” and “protected class” as “[a] class of people who benefit from protection by \nstatute.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The “class of citizens” identified in Section 2(b) is \nimmediately followed by the modifier “protected by subsection (a).”  52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).  \nThus, a natural understanding of the relevant “class” under Section 2 is that it includes any \ngroup whose minority members have had their right to vote denied or abridged “on account \nof their race or color.”  Id. at § 10301(a)–(b).  And the comparison required by Section 2 \nis naturally  understood as  one  between harmed minority voters and unharmed other \nmembers of the electorate, which, depending on the circumstances, may include only white \nvoters or white voters and members of other discrete minority groups.  Reading the use of \n“class” in the singular to restrict Section 2 claims to discrete minority groups would take \nthe term unnaturally out of the context in which it is written.  See Yates v. United States, \n574 U.S. 528, 537 (2015). \nEven if it were ambiguous whether the text of Section 2 protects a coalition of \nminority voters from discrete minority groups, the legislative history of Section 2 and broad \n51 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 52 of 64\n \nremedial purpose of the VRA both support recognizing such claims.25  When Congress \namended Section 2 in 1982, it was “aware that more than one minority group could be \nconsidered to constitute one plaintiff class in determining the availability of Voting Rights \nAct protection.”  Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1395 (Keith, J., dissenting).  Indeed, in its Report on \nthe  1982  amendments,  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  referenced  a  Supreme  Court \ndistricting case that involved a coalition of Black and Hispanic voters in New York.  S. \nRep. No. 97-417, at 19 n.60 (citing Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 52–54 (1964)).26  \nYet it did not seek to limit the protected “class of citizens” to members of a single minority \ngroup.  Further, in expanding the VRA to protect language minority groups in 1975, \nCongress recognized and sought to address the fact that members of different minority \ngroups,  including  Hispanic  Americans  and  Asian  Americans,  have  faced  similar \n \n25  The  Supreme  Court  has  often  looked  to  Section  2’s  legislative  history  in \ninterpreting the provision in other contexts.  E.g., Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50–51. \n26 In Wright, plaintiffs alleged that the State’s districting scheme was “contrived to \ncreate one district . . . which excludes non-white citizens and citizens of Puerto Rican \norigin,” while concentrating those citizens in three other districts.  376 U.S. at 53–54.  The \nCourt subsequently found that plaintiffs had failed to prove a violation of their rights \nbecause they had not shown that New York’s districting law was motivated by racial \nconsiderations.  Id. \n \nThe Senate Report accompanying the 1975 amendments to the VRA also referenced \na Supreme Court case in which several voting rights claims involving Hispanic and Black \nvoters were consolidated in one action with their rights evaluated collectively.  S. Rep. No. \n94-295, 27–28 (1975), as reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 774, 793–94 (“In January, 1972, \na three-judge Federal court ruled that the use of multi-member districts for the election of \nstate  legislators  in  Bexar  and  Dallas  counties,  Texas,  unconstitutionally  diluted  and \notherwise cancelled the voting strength of Mexican Americans and [B]lacks in those \ncounties.  This decision was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in White v. \nRegester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973).”). \n52 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 53 of 64\n \ndiscrimination and barriers to participation in the political process as African Americans.  \nS. Rep. No. 94-295, at 25, 28–29 (1975), as reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 774, 791 \n(“Language minority citizens, like [B]lacks throughout the South, must overcome the \neffects  of discrimination  as  well  as  efforts  to  minimize  the  impact  of  their  political \nparticipation. . . .

Finally, recognizing coalition claims is consistent with the broad \nremedial purpose of the VRA of “rid[ding] the country of racial discrimination in voting.”  \nChisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 308, 403 (quoting South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. \n301, 315 (1966)); see also id. (“[T]he [VRA] should be interpreted in a manner that \nprovides ‘the broadest possible scope’ in combating racial discrimination.” (citing Allen, \n393 U.S. at 567)). \nThus, I would find, in accord with nearly every other circuit to have faced the issue, \nthat coalition claims are cognizable for the purpose of proving Section 2 violations and, \ntherefore, that the district court did not err. \nii. \nThe district court also found that the Minority Community in Virginia Beach was \npolitically  cohesive  and,  therefore,  that  plaintiffs  had  satisfied  the  second  Gingles \nprecondition. \n“[T]o determine whether a minority group is politically cohesive, a court must \nascertain whether ‘a significant number of minority group members usually vote for the \n53 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 54 of 64\n \nsame candidates.’”  Levy v. Lexington Cnty., 589 F.3d 708, 719–20 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nGingles, 478 U.S. at 56).  With reference to coalition claims, the Supreme Court has stated \nin dicta that “when dilution of the power of such an agglomerated political bloc is the basis \nfor an alleged violation, proof of minority political cohesion is all the more essential.”  \nGrowe, 507 U.S. at 41 (assuming, without deciding, that coalition claims are cognizable \nunder Section 2 and explaining that in such cases “there [is] quite obviously a higher-than-\nusual need for the second of the Gingles showings”). \nThe district court found that the Minority Community was cohesive because “they \ntend to vote as a bloc, have a history of advocating for similar political and legal issues, \nand have similar experiences of discrimination.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1064. \nOn appeal, the City argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard to its \ncohesion inquiry because plaintiffs seeking to prove a coalition claim must provide statistical \nevidence  demonstrating  that  each  individual  constituent  group  shares  the  same  voting \npreferences.  The City also argues that the district court erred in relying in part on qualitative \nevidence of cohesion to support its finding that the second Gingles precondition was met. \nThe City relies primarily on Brewer, a Fifth Circuit case that reiterated that “minority \ngroups may be aggregated for purposes of asserting a Section 2 violation.”  Id. at 453.  In Brewer, \nthe court stated that the “determinative question” for political cohesion in such cases is: \n[W]hether [B]lack-supported candidates receive a majority of the Hispanic \nand Asian vote; whether Hispanic-supported candidates receive a majority of \nthe [B]lack and Asian vote; and whether Asian-supported candidates receive \na majority of the [B]lack and Hispanic vote in most instances in the KISD area. \n \n54 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 55 of 64\n \n876 F.2d at 453 (citing Campos, 840 F.2d at 1244–45).  Thus, to prove cohesion, the City \nargues that plaintiffs were required to provide statistical evidence separately estimating \nvoting preferences for each constituent group in the Minority Community to show that a \nmajority of Asian and Hispanic voters prefer the same candidates that are also preferred by \nBlack voters.  It is undisputed, however, that available statistical techniques are unable to \nestimate the respective voting patterns of the Hispanic and Asian communities in Virginia \nBeach because of the small size and geographic dispersion of those communities.  See J.A. 439, \nS.J.A. 284.  As a result, data compiled by plaintiffs’ statistical expert, Dr. Douglas Spencer, \nincluded voting support estimates in probative elections for White voters, Black voters, \nand an aggregate “All Minority” group, which included Black, Asian, Hispanic, and other \nminority voters.27 \nBut the City greatly overstates Brewer.  In explaining “the determinative question” \nof the cohesion inquiry for a coalition claim, the Brewer Court cited to Campos, a case \nwhich rejected the strict standard proposed by the City.  See Brewer, 876 F.2d at 453 (citing \nCampos, 840 F.2d at 1244–45).  In considering a coalition composed of Black and Hispanic \n \n27 The City argues that this metric is flawed because high Black support for a \ncandidate may mask lower support, or even opposition, from Hispanic and Asian voters \nsince the Black community in Virginia Beach is larger than the Asian and Hispanic \ncommunities.    Indeed,  plaintiffs’  expert  agreed  that  this  scenario  was  “one  possible \nexplanation” but found it less likely than that the group voted cohesively.  J.A. 377; see \nalso Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1075.  The district court thoroughly considered the \nlimitations of the statistical data and rejected the argument that it was “flawed.”  Holloway, \n531 F. Supp. 3d at 1076.  In particular, the court stressed that plaintiffs’ expert “used robust \nstatistical  methods  to  minimize  these  methodological  limitations”  and  noted  that  the \nlimitations present here were not unique to this case.  Id.  I do not find that the district court \nclearly erred in reaching this conclusion. \n55 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 56 of 64\n \nvoters, the Campos court explained that to show cohesiveness, “[t]he key is the minority \ngroup as a whole.”  Campos, 840 F.2d at 1245 (emphasis added) (rejecting the argument \nthat “in order to show cohesion when there are two minorities that make up the minority \ngroup, plaintiffs must show that Blacks are cohesive, that Hispanics are cohesive and that \nBlacks and Hispanics are together cohesive” because “that burden is too great, if not \nimpossible,  in certain  situations”).    The Campos  court  further  explained  that “if the \nstatistical evidence is that Blacks and Hispanics together vote for the Black or Hispanic \ncandidate, then cohesion is shown.”28  Id. at 1245 (emphasis added). \nThe Brewer court also recognized that “statistical evidence is not a sine qua non to \nestablishing cohesion” and noted that although the plaintiffs in that case had failed to \nprovide statistical evidence of cohesion, they could instead have put on “other evidence \ndemonstrat[ing] cohesion . . . . [to] satisfy their burden of proof under Section 2 and \nThornburg.”  876 F.2d at 453–54; see also Gingles, 478 U.S. at 31 (“A showing that a \nsignificant number of minority group members usually vote for the same candidates is one \nway of proving the political cohesiveness necessary to a vote dilution claim.” (emphasis \nadded)).  Since no particular type of evidence is necessary to prove cohesion, the district \ncourt did not err in considering substantial qualitative evidence showing that the Virginia \nBeach Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities “are politically cohesive with respect to \n \n28  Indeed,  the  Campos  court  approved  of  the  district  court’s  finding  that  an \necological regression model that compared the “Anglo Vote” for each relevant candidate \nwith the “Minority Vote,” which combined the Black and Hispanic vote, for each candidate \nwas sufficient to show cohesion.  840 F.2d at 1246 n.9, 1248 (“The standing evidence \nshowed that Blacks and Hispanics, as one minority, were politically cohesive.”). \n56 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 57 of 64\n \ntheir shared political advocacy.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1065.  For example, the \ncourt explained that the Minority Community had worked together on previous efforts to \nchange the City’s at-large method of elections, on efforts to request an economic disparity \nstudy of city contracts, and on housing and transportation issues.  Id. at 1065–67. \nIn sum, the district court applied the correct legal standard and did not clearly err in \nfinding cohesion of the Minority Community and, therefore, I would affirm its finding that \nplaintiffs’ satisfied the second Gingles precondition. \niii. \nFinally,  the  district  court  found  that  plaintiffs  had  satisfied  the  third  Gingles \nprecondition because they provided sufficient evidence that the white majority in Virginia \nBeach is “usually [able] to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. \nat 50–51. \n“[T]he degree of racial bloc voting that is cognizable as an element of a § 2 vote \ndilution claim will vary according to a variety of factual circumstances.”  Id. at 57–58.  \nThus, “there is no simple doctrinal test for the existence of legally significant racial bloc \nvoting.”  Id. at 58.  We have explained, however, that in determining whether the third \nprecondition  is  met,  “the  court  must  first  identify  those  individuals  who  constitute \nminority-preferred candidates of choice, and then analyze whether those candidates are \nusually defeated by majority [w]hite bloc voting.”  Levy, 589 F.3d at 716 (emphasis added).  \nEven if “no candidate received 50 percent or more of the minority vote,” a candidate \nconstitutes a “minority-preferred candidate of choice if that candidate would have been \nelected had the election been held only among minority voters.”  Id. at 718. \n57 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 58 of 64\n \nThe district court found that between 2008 and 2018, sixteen Black candidates ran \nfor City Council in Virginia Beach, nine of which were minority-preferred candidates.  \nHolloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1076.  There were also five minority-preferred candidates \nwho were white.  Id.  While 94 percent of the white community’s preferred candidates were \nsuccessful  during  this  time,  only  50 percent  of  the  Minority  Community’s preferred \ncandidates were successful.  Id.  The City emphasizes that such a 50-50 split cannot show \nthat the white majority in Virginia Beach is “usually” able to defeat minority-preferred \ncandidates.  But, as the court explained, when the recent election of two Black minority-\npreferred  candidates  under  special  circumstances  is  discounted,  the  success  rate  for \nminority-preferred candidates fell to 42 percent (five out of twelve probative elections).  \nId. at 1076–77.  Specifically, the district court found that over ten years of elections, only \none other Black minority-preferred candidate had been elected to City Council “absent the \nsocio-political effects of the present lawsuit” and that the two candidates elected in 2018 \nreceived “abnormally large support from white voters” when compared to the support \nreceived by Black minority-preferred candidates in prior elections.  Id. at 1077. \nThe City, however, argues that the district court improperly discounted the 2018 \nelection of two Black minority-preferred City Council candidates because it failed to \nexplain how this suit was connected to the election of those candidates and improperly \nconcluded that abnormal white support for the successful candidates cut in favor of rather \nthan against a showing of white bloc voting. \n“[A] pattern of racial bloc voting that extends over a period of time is more probative \nof a claim that a district experiences legally significant polarization than are the results of \n58 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 59 of 64\n \na single election[,] . . . [and, conversely,] the fact that racially polarized voting is not \npresent in one or a few individual elections does not necessarily negate the conclusion that \nthe district experiences legally significant bloc voting.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57.  And, as \nwe have previously explained, “Gingles . . . cautions against finding a lack of racially \npolarized voting where the success of a minority candidate can be attributed to special \ncircumstance.”  City of Norfolk, 883 F.2d at 1241–42 (finding that the election of a second \nBlack councilman to the Norfolk City Council “was due to the special circumstances \narising out of events associated with the pendency of this action” and, therefore, that it \n“should not be dispositive”); see also Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 (“[T]he success of a minority \ncandidate in a particular election does not necessarily prove that the district did not \nexperience polarized voting in that election; special circumstances, such as the absence of \nan opponent, incumbency, or the utilization of bullet voting, may explain minority electoral \nsuccess in a polarized contest.”).  For example, the Gingles Court found that the district \ncourt had not erred in “viewing with some caution [B]lack candidates’ success in [a \nparticular] election, and from deciding on the basis of all relevant circumstances to accord \ngreater weight to [B]lacks’ relative lack of success over the course of several recent \nelections.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 76 (“The court could properly notice the fact that [B]lack \nelectoral success increased markedly in the 1982 election—an election that occurred after \nthe  instant  lawsuit  had  been  filed—and  could  properly  consider  to  what  extent  ‘the \npendency of this very litigation [might have] worked a one-time advantage for [B]lack \ncandidates.’”). \n59 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 60 of 64\n \nHere, the district court discounted the probative value of the 2018 election of two \nBlack minority-preferred candidates only after it conducted a particularized investigation \ninto the circumstances surrounding the election, and I do not find that it clearly erred in \nreaching this conclusion.  The court explained that “the instant lawsuit . . . was a topic of \ndebate and discussion in the [2018] election”29 and that both of the successful 2018 \nminority-preferred candidates received “unusual white support compared to all other Black \nCity Council candidates since 2008.”  Holloway, 531 F. Supp.3d at 1077.  The court \nexpounded that one of the relevant candidates, Aaron Rouse, won one of the at-large seats \nwith 24 percent of the white vote, which was 15.4 percent higher than the average white \nsupport for the five other Black candidates who had run for at-large seats since 2008, and \nthat the other candidate, Sabrina Wooten, was the only Black candidate since 2008 to \nreceive a majority of the white vote (51 percent).  Id. \nThe court also noted that “the 50 [percent] success rate for minority-preferred \ncandidates does not comprehensively explain the severity and extent of white bloc voting \nin Virginia Beach” because when only Black minority-preferred candidates are considered, \nthe success rate falls to 21.4 percent.  Id. at 1076.  And, the court highlighted that “four of \nthe[] five white minority-preferred candidates received substantial support from white \nvoters which is the reason that they won their election” and that “[c]ritically, the only white \n \n29 Notably, we have previously explained that where an election occurs after the \nfiling of a VRA suit, “the absence of a conspiracy or an intent to moot th[e] litigation does \nnot end the district court’s inquiry.  The court should probe further to determine whether \nthe [B]lack candidate’s success in [a relevant election], while the action was pending, \nresulted from unusual circumstances.”  Collins v. City of Norfolk, 816 F.2d 932, 938 (4th \nCir. 1987). \n60 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 61 of 64\n \nminority-preferred candidate . . . who lost, was unsuccessful because she received dismal \nsupport from white voters . . . .”  Id. at 1078.  Thus, it found that the fact that “white \nminority-preferred candidates account for about 30 [percent]” of the election wins of \nminority-preferred candidates is further evidence of white bloc voting in Virginia Beach \nbecause it shows that minority-preferred candidates win only in the rare cases where they \nreceive white support or where multiple white candidates split the white bloc vote.  Id. \nThus, “[b]ased on all the evidence before it,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 54, the court \nfound “substantial evidence of white bloc voting in Virginia Beach Council elections.”  \nHolloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d. at 1078.  I do not find that the district court clearly erred in \nreaching this conclusion. \nB. \nThe district court then found that, under the totality of the circumstances, minority \nvoters in Virginia Beach “ha[ve] less opportunity than other members of the electorate to \nparticipate in the political process and elect their preferred candidates.”  Id. at 1080. \n“The  ultimate  finding  of  a  district  court  that  based  on  the  totality  of  the \ncircumstances an election scheme dilutes minority voters’ ability to participate in the \npolitical process and to elect representatives of their choice in violation of § 2 is a factual \nfinding subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.”  Cane v. Worcester Cnty., 35 \nF.3d 921, 925 (4th Cir. 1994).  Under this standard, “[i]f the district court’s view of the \nevidence is plausible in light of the entire record, an appellate court may not reverse even \nif it is convinced that it would have weighed the evidence differently in the first instance.”  \nBrnovich v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2349 (2021). \n61 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 62 of 64\n \nIn reaching its conclusion, the district court considered each of the nine factors \nincluded in the Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to the VRA and found \nthat plaintiffs had shown that each factor was met.  For example, the court found that there \nwas a long history of official discrimination against members of the Minority Community \nin the Commonwealth of Virginia and the City of Virginia Beach, including the use of \nliteracy tests and a poll tax (factor one), that this “history of racial discrimination has had \na disproportionate impact on the education, employment, economic, and social conditions \nof the Minority Community” (factor five), and that “the City of Virginia Beach has been \nunresponsive to the needs of the Minority Community” (factor eight).  Holloway, 531 F. \nSupp.3d at 1096.  The district court properly conducted a “searching practical evaluation \nof the past and present reality” in Virginia Beach and determined that “the political process \nis [not] equally open to minority voters” in the City.  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (quoting S. \nRep. No. 97-417, at 30).  I see no clear error in the court’s analysis and would not disturb \nits conclusion. \nThe City, however, argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in \nconducting its analysis because it did not rely on evidence related to each discrete minority \ngroup under each factor.  In other words, the City contends that when dealing with a \ncoalition claim, the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis requires that each factor is met \nfor each constituent minority group and that the court failed to meet that standard here \nbecause while it found each factor was met with respect to the Black community in Virginia \nBeach,  it  did  not  make  the  same  finding  with  respect  to  the  Asian  and  Hispanic \ncommunities. \n62 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 63 of 64\n \nBut when conducting a Section 2 totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, “there is no \nrequirement that any particular number of factors be proved or that a majority of them point \none way or the other.”  Gingles, 478 U.S. at 45 (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29).  Thus, \nthe district court was not required to find evidence showing that all nine factors were met—\nmuch less evidence that each factor was satisfied with respect to each discreet minority \ngroup.  Indeed, adopting the legal standard urged by defendants—that the district court \nmust evaluate each factor with respect to each minority group—would result in “[a]n \ninflexible rule [that] run[s] counter to the textual command of § 2,” which requires that a \ndetermination  of  whether  a  violation  has  occurred  be  “based  on  the  totality  of  the \ncircumstances.”  Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1018 (1994); see also Gingles, 478 \nU.S. at 46. \nThe City also argues that the district court erred because it should have found, under \nDe Grandy, that the fact that two of the ten seats on the City Council are currently held by \nminority-preferred candidates, in “rough proportion” to the Minority Community’s share \nof the voting age population in the City, weighs heavily against a finding of a Section 2 \nviolation.  In De Grandy, the Supreme Court held that “where in spite of continuing \ndiscrimination and racial bloc voting, minority voters form effective voting majorities in a \nnumber of districts roughly proportional to the minority voters’ respective shares in the \nvoting-age population. . . . is a relevant fact in the totality of the circumstances.”  512 U.S. \nat 1000; see also N.A.A.C.P., Inc., v. City of Columbia, , No. 93-2319, 1994 WL 449081, \nat  *1–2  (4th  Cir.  Aug.  22,  1994).    “[T]he  degree  of  probative  value  assigned  to \nproportionality[, however,] may vary with other facts.”  De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1020.  The \n63 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 93            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 64 of 64\n \ndistrict court found that De Grandy was “inapplicable in this case” because the recent \nelection of two Black minority-preferred candidates to the City Council was due to special \ncircumstances.  Holloway, 531 F. Supp. 3d at 1079.  As previously explained, the district \ncourt’s decision to give less probative value to the 2018 election of Aaron Rouse and \nSabrina Wooten, two minority-preferred candidates, is well supported, and I do not find \nthat the district court committed clear error in reaching its conclusion. \n \nIV. \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the at-large \nelection of the City’s ten (nonmayoral) City Council seats denies Black, Hispanic, and \nAsian voters in Virginia Beach equal access to the electoral and political process, in \ncontravention of Section 2 of the VRA.  Thus, I would affirm the district court. \n64 \n ",

Background\nOn November 20, 2017, Plaintiff an African-American\nregistered voter and resident of Virginia Beach, filed\nher vote dilution and ADA discrimination complaint\nagainst the Virginia Beach City Council, alleging that\nthe City's at-large system discriminate against and\ndeprive or tend to deprive. African-Americans and other\n^'ethnic minorities\" by reason it unfairly dilutes or\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 2 of 12 PageID# 96\nminimizes their voting strength\" and consistently\ndeprives them an equal opportunity to elect candidates\nof their choice in violation of Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965, as amended 42 U.S.C. §1973 et.\nseq., 42 U.S.C. §1983, the First, Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nthrough adoption in the 1906-1962 city charter of the\nat-large elections scheme as a means to promote\nracially discriminatory objectives \"white-supremacy\".\nThe complaint also, alleges the City deprives elderly\nindividuals and all people with disabilities basic\naccessible or alternate polling places in elections,\nin violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as\namended 42 U.S.C. §1973, 42 U.S.C. §1983, Title II\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the\nVoting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped\nAct of 1984 (VAEHA), and of the First, Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nwhile acting under color of state law.\nI.TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE; Plaintiff alleges that her minority group is politically cohesive and has\nbeen consistently denied the election of its preferred candidates by the white majority's use of\nbloc voting techniques, and that African-American voters are \"sufficiently geographically compact\nto constitute a majority in a reasonably drawn balancing voting district.\" See, e.g. McDaniels\nV. Mehfoud, 702 F. Supp. 588, 592 (E.D. Va. 1989). Virginia Const. Art. VII, § 5.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 3 of 12 PageID# 97\nII. Plaintiff^s First Cause of Action\nThe change in the election system of Virginia Beach\ntook place in several stages, during the period 1906-\n1962, under the authorization of Virginia Acts (1916),\nChapter 55, Virginia Beach Voters supported the\ncreation of a local government plan embodied in state\nlaw under which the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia,\nwas consolidated with Princess Ann County in 1963, to\nform seven boroughs, which vary considerably in\npopulation.\nUnder the Seven-Four Plan of the amended charter\ninvolved herein, the new city council consists of 11\nmembers, each of whom is elected at large. Four are\nelected without regard to residence; each of the seven\nothers must reside in a different borough.\nVirginia Beach was chartered as a municipal corporation\nby the General Assembly of Virginia on January 1, 1963.\nThe city currently operates under the council-manager\nat-large form of government.\nIII. TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE: It should be noted in 1967, the Court did not address invidious\ndiscrimination in voting, it was held the City's plan made no distinction based on race, creed,\nor economic status or location and the charter was local, and not one for a three-judge court;\nand this Court in 1967, did address vote dilution and dismissed Lincoln for failure to prosecute.\nMoody v. Flowers, ante, p. 387 U. S. 97, followed. P. 387 U.S. 114. Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. 112,\nMay 22, 1967. See Lincoln v. City of Virginia Beach, No. 2:97cv756(E.D. V.A. Dec. 29, 1997).\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID# 98\nThose favoring the new system won a handy majority in\nthe required popular referendum held in November, 1917.\nAs a result in February, 1918, the legislature approved\nan act implementing at-large election schemes:\nVirginia Acts (1918), Chapter 34.\nThe purpose behind the council-manager at-large\napartheid scheme, if we were to accept the public\nstatements of its proponents, were those commonly\nexpressed during the '^Progressive period:\"\na) Ward elections produced ''boss rule\" and corruption.\nb) The the council-manager at-large apartheid form of\nGovernment were more \"efficient\" and \"business-like\"\nthan the traditional mayor-council system.\nc) At-large elections were more \"representative\" than\nward elections in the sense that every voter in the\ncity had an opportunity to cast a ballot for every\noffice to be filled, not just those to be chosen by the\nresidents of his particular ward.\nI. This suit was filed here in 2017 by an African-American citizen of Virginia Beach,\nalleging that the \"at-large system of electing members of the Virginia Beach City\nCouncil unlawfully diluted African-American and other minorities voting strength in\nviolation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, As amended in 1982, 42 U.S.C,\n§ 1973. Thornburq v. Ginqles, 478 U.S. 30, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 92 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1986)\nCity of Norfolk v. Collins, 498 U.S. 938, 111 S. Ct. 340, 112 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1990).\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID# 99\nd) The existing separate political subdivisions between\nVirginia Beach and Princess Anne County were\nmalapportioned. (This could, of course, have been\nremedied by re-drawing district lines.)\nOften acknowledged was an additional consideration that\nreflects an awareness of the differential electoral\nimpact of at-large systems: city-wide voting of\nelecting businessmen to office. The Chief institutional\nforce behind the change of government in Virginia Beach\nwas, predictably, the Chamber of Commerce.\nThere was a significant racial ingredient in Virginia\nBeach's decision to end separate political subdivisions\nbetween Virginia Beach and Princess Anne County\nelections and impose an exclusively at-large scheme,\nwhich has operated for over five-decades, 56 years to\ndeprive Plaintiff and others similarly situated equal\ntreatment and an opportunity to vote for a candidate\nof their choice in violation of Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965, as amended 42 U.S.C. §1973 et.\nseq., 42 U.S.C. §1983, and the First, Fourteenth and\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 6 of 12 PageID# 100\nFifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nthrough adoption in the 1906-1962 city charter of the\nat-large elections as a means to promote racially\ndiscriminatory objectives.\nAfrican-Americans and ethnic minorities similarly\nsituated continue to register and vote in Virginia\nBeach, although in much smaller numbers, after the\nimplementation of the 1902 Virginia Constitution.\nPrecise registration figures are hard to find, but as\nlate as 1910 African-Americans and ethnic minorities\nvoted in significant numbers in predominately minority\npolitical subdivisions, both in the Democratic primary\nand in the general elections.\nIn 1912 Virginia adopted a \"white primary law,\"\nallowing the Democratic Party to set the requirements\nfor voting in its primary elections, with the\nunderstanding that it would restrict the ballot of\nwhites. Andrew Buni, The Negro in Virginia Politics,\npp. vii , 60-63.\nII. TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE: When Virginia Beach incorporated in the early\n1900s, its boundaries skirted the heavily black community of Seatack. Even\nnow, few blacks live in the original resort strip. In the 2000 U.S. census,\n5.4 percent of the resort area's population was black.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 7 of 12 PageID# 101\nIII. Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action\nWithin the overall City's at-large election district,\nAfrican-American voting age population in Beechwood,\nGracetown, New Light, Doyletown, Queen City, Great\nNeck and Burton Station, included but not limit\nthereto; is sufficiently large and geographically\ncompact to constitute a 50% majority and/or Seven\nmajority single-member districts. See, e.g. McDaniels\nv. Mehfoud, 702 F. Supp. 588, 592 (E.D. Va.l989).\nVirginia Const. Art. VII, § 5.\nThe City's at-large scheme consistently deprives\nminorities of equal treatment and an opportunity\nto vote for a candidate of their choice as guaranteed\nby the Voting Rights Act, 1965, as amended, 42 U.S. C.\n§1973, et. seq., 42 U.S.C. §1983, the First, Fourteenth\nand the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution while acting under color of state law.\nSee Thornburq v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986). Brown\nV. Thomas, 462 U.S. 835, 842-43 (1983).\nIII. TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE: Plaintiff has shown that a minority\nrepresentation district can be drawn \"in a manner that complies\n^with the overriding demands of the Equal Protection Clause.\nSanchez v. Colorado, 861 F. Supp. 1516, 1523 (D. Colo. 1994)).\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID# 102\nIV. Plaintiff's Third Cause of Action\nThe City Council lacks any meaningful proportionate\nrepresentation, because it does not have an African-\nAmerican member, and never had a ^''minority mayor\"\nor ^^vice-mayor\" since it became an incorporated\ntown in 1906, and gained status as an independent\ncity in 1952, seven of the 11 council members\nrepresent districts, they must win the citywide vote,\ntoo. The other three council members and mayor are\nelected at-large from candidates residing anywhere\nwithin the City, that has the purpose and effect of\ndenying or abridging the rights of African-Americans,\nethnic and linguistic minorities to vote on account of\nrace or color in violation of Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965, as amended 42 U.S.C. § 1973 et.\nseq., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the First, Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nI. TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE: Plaintiff alleges that from 1906 until 1986 every member\nof Virginia Beach's city council to hold office was white. In 1986 John Richard Logan\nPerry, was the first Black elected to Council until 1990, Louisa M. Strayhorn was the\nfirst Black female from 1994-1998, and Dr. Amelia Ross-Hammond was the second Black\nfemale from 2013 until 2016, and from that time, until this reply objection was filed,\nthe council had no black member. In an at-large system, the majority always has the\nstrength to elect all of its candidates. By taking a historical white bloc voting\nanalysis into consideration, it provides a more accurate portrayal of vote dilution\nor compelling evidence that the system is operating to dilute black votes. Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 56, 106 S.Ct. at 2769.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 9 of 12 PageID# 103\nV. Plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action\nThe white majority can vote for candidates anywhere\nwithin the City's at-large election district, that\nprecludes a African-Americans choices from having any\nbearing or significant meaning in an election on par\nwith white voters in the same election, that has the\neffect of consistently diluting or minimizing blacks,\n''ethic minorities and linguistic minorities voting\nstrength\" in violation of Section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S. C. §1973,\net. seq., 42 U.S.C. §1983, the First, Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nand laws.\nVI. Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action\nThe white majority can vote for candidates anywhere\nwithin the City's at-large election district, that\nprecludes African-Americans choices from having any\nbearing or significant meaning in an election on par\nwith white voters in the same election, that has the\nconsistent effect of diluting or minimizing blacks,\nminorities and linguistic minorities\" voting strength\"\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 10 of 12 PageID# 104\nin violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965, as amended, 42 U.S. C. §1973, et. seq., 42 U.S.C\n§1983, the First, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments\nto the United States Constitution and laws.

NOTICE; It should be noted the Defendant must be rejected because it has not\ndenied that the City's at-large election district does not discriminate or unfairly dilutes or\nminimizes the voting strength of African-Americans and other \"ethnic minorities\" in violation\nof Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended 42 U.S.C. §1973 et. seq., W.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 26   Filed 06/05/18   Page 11 of 12 PageID# 105\nVII. Plaintiff's Sixth Cause of Action\nThe plaintiff alleges the City of Virginia Beach,\nVirginia (the '\"City\") voting precincts, #0005 Seatack,\n#0034 Blackwater, #0030 Red Wing, #0011 Cape Henry,\n#0002 South Beach, #0055 Magic Hollow, including but\nnot limited to #0072 Rudee, lack adequate handicapped\nparking and basic accessible or alternate polling\nplaces in elections, which discriminate against and\ndeprive or tend to deprive people with disabilities\nbecause of their disability, that has had a disparate\nimpact against elderly individuals and all people with\ndisabilities, in violation of the Voting Rights Act\nof 1965, as amended 42 U.S.C. §1973, 42 U,S.C. §1983,\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\nand the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and\nHandicapped Act of 1984 (VAEHA), and of the First,\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution while acting under color of state\nlaw.\nVII.

      "text": "Case 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 308   Filed 10/18/22   Page 1 of 7 PageID# 10104\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nNORFOLK DIVISION \n \nLatasha Holloway, et al.,   \nPlaintiffs,   \nv.    Case No. 2:18-cv-0069 \nCity of Virginia Beach, et al.,   \nDefendants.   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ CONSOLIDATED BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS \nAND IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO STAY \n \nThis Court has no authority to stay proceedings that present no live controversy. Plaintiffs \ndo not challenge the redistricting plan the City of Virginia Beach is now using and could not \ncolorably do so because this Court found it compliant with Section 2 at Plaintiffs’ prompting. \nRather than identify a live injury-in-fact, Plaintiffs ask this Court to stay this case to await future \naction by the City that may or may not result in a colorable injury-in-fact. But a dispute over what \nmay occur sometime next year (or beyond) is unripe, and the Court lacks jurisdiction to maintain \na lawsuit indefinitely only to find out later what it challenges. The Court must deny Plaintiffs’ \nmotion to stay proceedings, ECF No. 306, and dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction, see Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(1); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (“If the court determines at any time that it \nlacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.”). \n1.  On July 27, 2022, the Fourth Circuit held that this Court “erred in reaching the \nmerits”  of  Plaintiffs’  Section  2  claim,  because  a  new  Virginia  law,  HB  2198,  “eliminated \nthe . . . Virginia Beach all-at-large system at the heart of this case, leaving the district court without \njurisdiction to rule on the legality of that system and thus without jurisdiction to direct a remedy.” \nHolloway v. City of Virginia Beach, 42 F.4th 266, 272–73 (4th Cir. 2022). The Fourth Circuit \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 308   Filed 10/18/22   Page 2 of 7 PageID# 10105\nremanded the case to allow this Court to determine whether “the plaintiffs should be permitted to \namend their complaint” to convert this case into a challenge to the replacement plan or whether \nsuch a claim is “better pursued in a new proceeding.” Id. at 277–78. \n2.  But the Fourth Circuit issued that ruling too late for the City to adopt and implement \na new redistricting plan for the 2022 elections. Thus, until further notice, the City will utilize the \nplan fashioned in this case by a court-appointed special master, approved by this Court, and \nendorsed by Plaintiffs. See ECF No. 290 (order adopting special master’s plan); ECF No. 282 \n(Plaintiffs’ assertion that this Court should adopt the special master’s plan). The Supreme Court \nhas recognized that election exigencies may justify or even compel state authorities to use a court-\nconfigured plan, even though the court erred in imposing it. See Upham v. Seamon, 456 U.S. 37, \n44 (1982). \n3.  Plaintiffs do not (and could not) contend that they have a challenge to the plan the \nCity is currently using. Nor do Plaintiffs identify how they could amend their complaint to state a \nlive claim. Instead, they ask this Court to stay proceedings “until March 2023” because (they say) \nthis would “provide the new Council with the opportunity to consider and decide upon the method \nof election they propose to utilize for future City Council elections.” ECF No. 306 at 3. Plaintiffs \ndo not explain why March 2023 is the appropriate time “to commence proceedings.” Id. Although \nit is likely (not certain) that, as Plaintiffs suggest, the City Council will not address the election \nsystem until after the terms of new members take effect in January 2023, the Council has not \ncommitted to resolving the issue by March 2023, the current members could not bind future \nmembers in that way, and it remains unknown what system will be selected or when or whether \nthe system will even change from what the City is now using. \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 308   Filed 10/18/22   Page 3 of 7 PageID# 10106\n4.  Plaintiffs’ claim is therefore unripe. “To be fit for judicial review, a controversy \nshould be presented in a ‘clean-cut and concrete form.’” South Carolina v. United States, 912 F.3d \n720, 730 (4th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted). “This occurs when the [challenged] action is ‘final and \nnot dependent on future uncertainties or intervening’” government action. Id. (citation omitted). \n“On the other hand, . . . a plaintiff’s claim is not ripe for judicial review ‘if it rests upon contingent \nfuture events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’” Id. (citation \nomitted). Stated differently, a claim “should be dismissed as unripe if the plaintiff has not yet \nsuffered injury and any future impact ‘remains wholly speculative.’” Doe v. Va. Dep’t of State \nPolice, 713 F.3d 745, 758 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Gasner v. Bd. of Supervisors, 103 F.3d 351, \n361 (4th Cir. 1996)). “[R]ipeness is a question of subject matter jurisdiction,” South Carolina, 912 \nF.3d at 730 (citation omitted), and it is “well-settled that there is no federal subject matter \njurisdiction over a matter that is unripe,” Hyatt v. U.S.P.T.O., 110 F. Supp. 3d 644, 654 (E.D. Va. \n2015) (citing Sansotta v. Town of Nags Head, 724 F.3d 533, 548 (4th Cir. 2013)). \n5.  That is the case here. Plaintiffs acknowledge that it remains unknown what election \nmechanism the City will ultimately adopt, and it is equally unknown whether Plaintiffs will have \na colorable basis to challenge it. Furthermore, it will be insufficient for the Council to select a plan; \nthe plan would also be subjected to a new state-law preclearance review process designed to ensure \nequal minority electoral opportunity, see Va. Code § 24.2-129, which Plaintiffs represented to the \nFourth Circuit is “more protective than Section 2,” Appellees’ Br. 17, Holloway v. City of Virginia \nBeach, No. 21-1533, Doc. 62 (filed Feb. 7, 2022). During that process, this Court would not be \npermitted to adjudicate a federal claim against the City’s plan. See Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, \n33 (1993). In sum, Plaintiffs may never be injured, any injury that may arise may be remedied \nthrough the Virginia state system, and only after the Council acts—and its acts are found compliant \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 308   Filed 10/18/22   Page 4 of 7 PageID# 10107\nwith state law—will Plaintiffs even arguably have a live claim. Because Plaintiffs’ claims are not \nripe, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and “must dismiss the complaint in its entirety.” \nArbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006) (citations omitted); see United States ex rel. \nCarson v. Manor Care, Inc., 851 F.3d 293, 303 (4th Cir. 2017).  \n6.  Plaintiffs provide no basis for the Court to conclude otherwise, even though it is \ntheir burden to establish that their lawsuit asserts a ripe claim, see Doe, 713 F.3d at 758. Instead, \nthey ask this Court to stay proceedings to await a future injury that might never occur. But if claims \nare “not yet ripe for judicial review,” a federal court “is without authority to hold them in \nabeyance.” Stephen v. Murray, No. 14-cv-4951, 2016 WL 4402020, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, \n2016). A stay of proceedings is not “a proper remedy” to overcome a jurisdictional ripeness defect. \nCriswell Coll. v. Sebelius, No. 3:12-cv-4409, 2013 WL 12363620, at *6 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2013); \nsee also Colo. Christian Univ. v. Sebelius, No. 11-cv-03350, 2013 WL 93188, at *8 (D. Colo. Jan. \n7, 2013). Plaintiffs’ discussion of discretionary stay factors, see ECF No. 306 at 2–3, lacks any \nrelevance because “retaining jurisdiction is simply not an option” when “claims are either moot or \nunripe.” Harris Patriot Healthcare Sols., LLC v. United States, 95 Fed. Cl. 585, 597 (2010). \n7.  To the extent Plaintiffs rely on the Fourth Circuit’s decision to “remand without \ninstructions to dismiss the plaintiffs’ case,” Holloway, 42 F.4th at 277, that position would be \nunfounded. The Fourth Circuit applied a doctrine permitting a moot case to be converted through \nan amended pleading into a new suit challenging a “‘residual claim under the new framework’” \nthat already exists at the time amendment would be appropriate. Id. at 277 (quoting N.Y. State Rifle \n& Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. City of New York, 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1526 (2020)). That doctrine depends on \nthe existence of a new law to challenge, which marks the continuation of a ripe controversy. See \nN.Y. State Rifle, 140 S. Ct. at 1526 (discussing plaintiffs’ quarrels with the modified gun-regulation \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 308   Filed 10/18/22   Page 5 of 7 PageID# 10108\nregime, already in effect, that mooted their appeal); Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 482 \n(1990) (permitting new claim to proceed against amendments that “were passed” during the \npendency of the suit (emphasis added)); Diffenderfer v. Cent. Baptist Church of Miami, Fla., Inc., \n404 U.S. 412, 415 (1972) (contemplating that plaintiffs “may wish to amend their complaint so as \nto demonstrate that the repealed statute retains some continuing force or to attack the newly \nenacted legislation” (emphasis added)). Here, the City is now using the court-ordered plan, which \nPlaintiffs do not (and could not) challenge. Plaintiffs are not now able to amend their complaint, \nand converting this case into a challenge to some unknown future system is jurisdictionally off \nlimits. The Fourth Circuit did not authorize this Court to transgress bedrock ripeness principles by \nholding this case open for months, even years, as a vehicle to challenge some future action that \nmay never give rise to a colorable claim. \n8.  Plaintiffs’ recourse, if a ripe claim ever emerges, will be to initiate a new lawsuit \nasserting that claim. That avenue fully protects Plaintiffs’ rights under Section 2, which can be \nenforced with equal vigor in a new lawsuit. Plaintiffs do not explain why their rights can be \nasserted only in an amended pleading in a proceeding with this case’s caption and number. \nAccordingly, even if jurisdictional principles did not compel dismissal (they do), the Court’s \ndiscretion would be best served by requiring any new claim to be “pursued in a new proceeding,” \nas the Fourth Circuit suggested. Holloway, 42 F.4th at 278. Plaintiffs fail to address that possibility \nin their motion to stay. Instead, they compare their proposed approach of a lengthy stay against the \nalleged alternative approach of prosecuting this case immediately (against what plan, they do not \nsay). See ECF No. 306 at 2–3. But Plaintiffs cannot establish a basis for a stay of proceedings “by \nclear and convincing circumstances,” Gibbs v. Plain Green, LLC, 331 F. Supp. 3d 518, 525 (E.D. \nVa. 2018) (citation omitted), when they fail to address one of the avenues the Fourth Circuit \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 308   Filed 10/18/22   Page 6 of 7 PageID# 10109\nproposed as a permissible basis for proceeding. Indeed, it is the only avenue that makes sense—\neither as a jurisdictional or discretionary matter—given that Plaintiffs cannot plausibly “amend \ntheir complaint” now to raise a colorable challenge, Holloway, 42 F.4th at 277. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion to stay proceedings should be denied, and the Court \nshould dismiss this case for lack of a live case or controversy. \n    \nDATE: October 18, 2022  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Katherine L.

      "title": "Memorandum In Support Of Defendants' Motion To Exclude Plaintiffs' Supplemental Expert Reports And Opinions",
      "text": "Case 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 1 of 13 PageID# 5079\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nNORFOLK DIVISION \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-0069 \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO EXCLUDE \nPLAINTIFFS’ SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERT REPORTS AND OPINIONS  \n \nCOME NOW the Defendants, and in support of their Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs’ \nSupplemental Expert Reports and Opinions, state as follows: \nThis Court set July 15, 2019, as the deadline for Plaintiffs to produce their expert \nreports and disclosures, and September 9, 2019, as the expert discovery cutoff.  On March \n16, 2020, many months after both deadlines lapsed, Plaintiffs served “supplemental” expert \nreports from two experts, Anthony Fairfax and Douglas Spencer.  These “supplemental” \nreports were premised on new analyses and new illustrative districts that Fairfax prepared in \nresponse to his own failure to draw the illustrative districts in his original reports to include \nPlaintiff Georgia Allen’s residential address.  Plaintiffs served these “supplemental” reports \nwithout leave of Court to do so. \nThe Plaintiffs’ so-called “supplemental” experts reports constitute out-of-time \ndisclosures, offering new analyses and conclusions that Plaintiffs had a duty to disclose in their \ninitial expert disclosures, and most certainly before the close of expert discovery.  These newly \noffered opinions are not the kind of supplements contemplated by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e), i.e., \nsupplements to correct discrete error or omission.  These “supplemental” expert reports contain \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 2 of 13 PageID# 5080\nwholly new analyses regarding key inquiries in this case.  Because these out-of-time \ndisclosures violate Rule 26 and are neither justifiable nor harmless, and for the reasons that \nfollow, the Court should enter an order precluding Plaintiffs from offering any opinions or \nanalysis at trial based on these improper “supplemental” expert reports.   \nBACKGROUND  \n \nOn June 24, 2019, this Court entered its Order Amending Rule 16(B) Scheduling Order \n(ECF No. 89) (the “Scheduling Order,”), by consent of the parties, fixing deadlines for fact and \nexpert discovery.  The cutoff for fact discovery was September 3, 2019, and the expert \ndiscovery cutoff was September 9, 2019. (Id.)  Defendants’ original expert reports were due \nJuly 15, 2019, and any rebuttal expert reports were due on August 12, 2019. (Id.)  Pursuant to \nthe Court’s imposed October 22, 2019, deadline for dispositive motions, the Defendants filed \ntheir motion for summary judgment, (ECF No. 114), which the Court denied in its March 11, \n2019, Order, (ECF No. 126).  Trial is currently set to begin October 6, 2020, with pretrial \ndisclosures due September 2, 2020. (ECF No. 142.)   \nOn March 16, 2020, more than six months after the expert discovery cutoff and eight \nmonths after Plaintiffs’ expert disclosure deadline, Plaintiffs served supplemental reports from \neach of their experts, Anthony Fairfax (“Fairfax”) and Douglas Spencer (“Spencer”).  These \ntwo supplemental reports, in relevant part, corrected an error in Fairfax’s analysis: that “none of \nthe hypothetical redistricting plans in my [i.e., Fairfax’s] previous [rebuttal] report included \nPlaintiff Georgia Allen’s address in a majority Hispanic, Black, and Asian (“HBA”) Citizen \nVoting Age Population (“CVAP”) district...” (Ex. 1 at 1.)  This was not a minor error; the \ninclusion of Ms. Allen’s address required him to generate three new districts to serve as \nillustrative districts and invalidated all of the illustrative districts Fairfax previously purported \nto include Ms. Allen’s home address. (Id. at 3.)  Indeed, the only illustrative districts offered in \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 3 of 13 PageID# 5081\nthis case by Fairfax that include Ms. Allen’s address were the ones produced in the out-of-time \nsupplemental report.  Spencer’s supplemental report, in turn, served chiefly to conduct \nperformance analyses on Fairfax’s newly drawn districts (even though Spencer had not \nconducted performance analyses on Fairfax’s earlier disclosed districts, as contained in \nFairfax’s rebuttal report). (See generally Ex. 2.)  \nFairfax’s new districts required new analyses—not just minor corrections—by both \nexperts, and were served months after deadlines for Plaintiffs’ original expert reports, rebuttal \nexpert reports, and expert discovery cutoff deadlines all had passed.  First, Fairfax was \nunequivocal that none of the illustrative plans offered in his two prior reports included districts \nthat contained Plaintiff Allen’s address despite having known her address the entire time. (Ex. \n3, 15:5-15.)   In order to draw Plaintiff Allen’s address into these new illustrative districts, \nFairfax had to modify numerous areas of the proposed districts, including adding or removing \ndifferent block groups and voter tabulation districts (“VTDs”), and splitting VTDs. (Ex. 3, \n13:16—14:25.) Fairfax also acknowledged that, although including Allen was his sole purpose \nfor drawing the new districts, he made changes necessary to remain mindful of traditional \ndistricting criteria. (Ex. 3, 17:1-8.) Finally, Fairfax acknowledged that in drawing new districts \nthat contained Allen’s address, it was necessary to modify adjacent districts as well. (Ex. 3, \n18:3-8.) \nIn turn, Spencer’s supplemental report includes analysis of the performance of the new \ndistricts that Fairfax provided in his supplemental report. (See generally Ex. 2.)  Spencer states \nin his supplemental report that Fairfax’s newly offered illustrative plans “were not available \nwhen I wrote my earlier reports.” (Ex. 2 at 2.)  Notably, Spencer’s performance analysis is \nentirely new, and in fact, Spencer did not even attempt a performance analysis previously as to \nthe illustrative districts Fairfax offered in his rebuttal report.  (See generally Exs. 4, 5.)  In \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 4 of 13 PageID# 5082\nessence, Spencer used the occasion of Fairfax’s supplemental report to perform an entire type \nof analysis that he had neglected to perform as to Fairfax’s illustrative districts when they were \ninitially disclosed in Fairfax’s rebuttal report. \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Defendants are prejudiced by Plaintiffs’ untimely disclosure of new expert analyses. \n \nPlaintiffs served their new expert analyses many months after Plaintiffs’ expert \ndisclosures and expert discovery had closed and, importantly, after the August 12, 2019 \ndeadline for Defendants’ expert reports. Scheduling Order at 1.  These “supplemental” reports \nalso were produced nearly five months after the cutoff for dispositive motions, robbing \nDefendants of the opportunity to seek summary judgment based upon Plaintiffs’ experts’ new \nillustrative districts and performance analysis. (ECF. No. 114.)  As confirmed in deposition \ntestimony, Plaintiffs’ supplemental reports included 3 new illustrative districts.  Fairfax’s new \ndistricts are not a correction of a discrete error but constitute entirely new analysis.  That \nAllen’s address is now contained within the new districts’ borders is not the only salient \ncharacteristic of these new illustrative plans.  The manifold changes Fairfax was required to \nmake in order to draw these new districts—including adding areas and splitting VTDs—all \nimpact the constitutional viability of these districts and are subject to challenge. \nIn turn, Spencer’s performance analysis of these new districts is an entirely new \nanalysis—as Spencer’s June 9, 2020 deposition testimony confirms.1  Defendants have a right, \nunder the Federal Rules and the Scheduling Order, to rebut the work of both experts with their \n \n1 In his deposition testimony, Spencer explained the elaborate analytical process that goes into \nhis production of performance datapoints for these new districts. Using geographic information \nsystems (“GIS”) software, Spencer overlays census data onto maps of Virginia Beach, overlays \nFairfax’s new districts, uses software to confirm boundary alignment, and then aggregates votes \ntotals for each district. [Ex. 6, 21:3-11.] \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 5 of 13 PageID# 5083\nown expert disclosures, an opportunity Defendants lost by Plaintiffs’ decision to produce these \nnew reports long after the close of expert discovery.  Had these reports been timely produced, \nDefendants’ experts could have applied their own choice of analysis to rebut the reports \nincluding, among other things: replicating Plaintiffs’ experts’ aggregation of block-level data; \nchallenging assumptions about data used; rebutting Plaintiffs’ experts’ position on the \ncohesiveness of African American, Asian and Hispanic voters; and challenging the \ncompactness of the new districts, etc.  As can be seen in Defendants’ expert reports, attached as \nExhibits 7 and 8, Defendants’ experts’ analyses relied heavily on the shape and composition of \nFairfax’s maps and the related analysis by Spencer, all of which has now changed.  (See, e.g., \nEx. 7 at 3 (showing Defendants’ expert Quentin Kidd’s a reliance on Spencer’s data and \nanalysis to show that Spencer failed to establish voter cohesion among African American, \nAsian and Hispanic voters) and Ex. 8 at 1 (showing Defendants’ expert Peter Morrison’s \nreliance on Fairfax’s shape files and demographic data related to his illustrative districts).)  \nSimilarly, an opportunity to pursue summary judgment based upon the illustrative districts and \nperformance analysis that Plaintiffs actually intend to rely upon at trial was never available to \nthe Defendants because of Plaintiffs’ late disclosures. \nII.  The so-called “supplemental” reports of Plaintiffs experts constitute untimely expert \ndisclosures and not supplemental disclosures as contemplated by Rule 26(e). \n \nPlaintiffs have titled the new reports “supplemental reports,” perhaps in an effort to \nsuggest they are permissible supplemental disclosures contemplated by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e). \nThey are not.  These reports do not merely correct a minor error or omission; they constitute an \nentirely new analysis that is directly germane to their Section 2 claim.  As these new analyses \nwere not initially disclosed, as required, they are untimely.  And because these out-of-time \ndisclosures are not justified and are prejudicial to Defendants, they should be excluded from \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 6 of 13 PageID# 5084\nuse at trial and for other litigation purposes. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) requires that expert witnesses must produce a report \ncontaining, inter alia, “a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the \nbasis and reasons for them.” (emphasis added.)  Parties are required to provide such expert \ndisclosures according to the sequence established by the Court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(D).  In \nthis case, Plaintiffs’ expert disclosures were due July 15, 2019 (ECF No. 72 at ¶ 2) and the \ncutoff for expert discovery was September 9, 2019. (Scheduling Order at 1.)  Notwithstanding \nthose deadlines, Plaintiffs served the “supplemental” reports of Fairfax and Spencer on March \n16, 2020, eight months after their initial expert disclosure deadline and six months after the \nexpert discovery cutoff.  \nRule 37(c)(1) provides that where “a party fails to provide information or identify a \nwitness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or \nwitness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was \nsubstantially justified or is harmless.”2 \nPlaintiffs’ extremely untimely disclosures were neither justified nor harmless.  As \nFairfax himself explained—in deposition testimony given after disclosure of the supplemental \nreport—his failure to include Allen’s residential address in any of the illustrative districts he \noffered in his initial report was an error entirely of his own making. (Ex. 3, 15:16—16: 1.)  \nFairfax possessed Allen’s correct address when he prepared his original report and that address \nhas not changed. (Ex. 3, 16: 2-4.) \n \n2 Because the disclosure of expert reports in this case is governed by the Court’s scheduling \norder, Plaintiffs’ violation also implicates Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f). See Akeva L.L.C. v. Mizuno \nCorp., 212 F.R.D. 306, 309 (M.D.N.C. 2002).  Rule 16(f), in turn, gives courts the discretion to \nimpose any of the sanctions provided for in Rule 37(b)(2)(A), including “prohibiting the \ndisobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from \nintroducing designated matters in evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(ii). \n6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 7 of 13 PageID# 5085\nWhile Plaintiffs may contend that the omission of Ms. Allen from Fairfax’s initial \nanalysis and illustrative plans is simply a minor clerical error or omission subject to correction \nunder Rule 26(e), the truth is that the error required Fairfax to conduct entirely new analysis \nand generate new illustrative districts—work that then necessitated a new expert report by \nSpencer to analyze the performance of the new illustrative districts – an analysis that Spencer \ndid not perform as to the original illustrative districts contained in Fairfax’s Rebuttal Report. \n(See generally Ex. 5.)  That new analysis is outside the ambit of the type of omissions or errors \nthat can be corrected by a supplemental expert report.  In Akeva L.L.C. v. Mizuno Corp., 212 \nF.R.D. 306 (M.D.N.C. 2002), the court distinguished between a proper supplementation of \ndiscovery and an improper attempt to take a figurative “second bite at the apple” (or in this \ncase, third bite):  \nRule 26(e) envisions supplementation when a party's discovery disclosures \nhappen to be defective in some way so that the disclosure was incorrect or \nincomplete and, therefore, misleading.  It does not cover failures of omission \nbecause the expert did an inadequate or incomplete preparation. \nId. at 310.  The Akeva court excluded a “supplemental” expert report that added new testing \ndata while maintaining the expert’s original opinion, holding that “[t]o construe \nsupplementation to apply whenever a party wants to bolster or submit additional expert \nopinions would reek [sic] havoc in docket control and amount to unlimited expert opinion \npreparation.” Id.  The Akeva court found the offered ‘supplementation’ to be an out-of-time \ndisclosure and excluded the report. Id. at 310, 312. See also, e.g., Ullman v. Auto-Owners \nMutual Insurance Co., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25590, *13 (S.D. Ohio 2007) (excluding a report \noffered as a Rule 26(e) “supplementation” that included new analysis, warning that a party’s \n“presentation of a new or transformed opinion by ‘supplementation’ must be examined \nclosely”); East West, LLC v. Rahman, No. 1:11cv1380 (JCC/TCB), 2012 WL 4105129, *7 \n7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 8 of 13 PageID# 5086\n(E.D. Va. Sept. 17, 2012) (excluding “supplemental” expert report, produced beyond the expert \ndisclosure deadline, that contained “new information, new issues, and new expert analysis”).  \nIn further explaining why a new report offering new analysis—without justification—\ndid not fall under the umbrella of Rule 26(e), the court cited extensively to language from yet \nanother opinion whose reasoning supports Defendants’ position: \nAlthough Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e) requires a party to \"supplement or correct\" \ndisclosure upon information later acquired, that provision does not give license \nto sandbag one's opponent with claims and issues which should have been \nincluded in the expert witness' report (indeed, the lawsuit from the outset). \nTo rule otherwise would create a system where preliminary reports could be \nfollowed by supplementary reports and there would be no finality to expert \nreports, as each side, in order to buttress its case or position, could \"supplement\" \nexisting reports and modify opinions previously given. This practice would \nsurely circumvent the full disclosure requirement implicit in Rule 26 and would \ninterfere with the Court's ability to set case management deadlines, because new \nreports and opinions would warrant further consultation with one's own expert \nand virtually require new rounds of depositions. That process would hinder \nrather than facilitate settlement and the final disposition of the case. \n2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25590, at *13-14 (quoting Allgood v. General Motors Corp., 2007 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 8123, at *3-4 (S.D. Ind. Feb 2, 2007) (quoting Beller v. United States, 221 \nF.R.D. 689, 695 (D.N.M. 2003)). \nUllman went on to describe the prejudice incurred by defendants because of the out-of-\ntime report offered in that case: \n Plaintiffs' conduct frustrates the purpose and intent of the Federal Rules and the \nCourt's Orders. It is not mere \"supplementation\" when a party submits a \nmanifestly incomplete report lacking analysis or a supporting rationale, waits for \nthe summary judgment deadline to pass, and then submits a fuller report that \ncontains actual reasoning. Whether by strategic design or as an inescapable \nresult of Hartman's work product, Plaintiffs have placed Defendant at a \ndisadvantage. \n2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25590, *10 (emphasis added). \nHere, there has been no excuse offered for Fairfax’s failure to draw illustrative districts \n8 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 9 of 13 PageID# 5087\nthat included Ms. Allen’s address.  These fundamental revisions of expert analysis based upon \nFairfax’s error and Spencer’s omission of any performance analysis in their respective rebuttal \nreports placed the Defendants at a significant disadvantage.  Defendants were forced to operate \nunder an incorrect understanding about which districts Plaintiffs intend to offer at trial—though \nthey were led to believe that they had possession of the operative analyses.  Not until eight \nmonths after the expiration of the expert disclosure deadline did Defendants receive the actual \ndistricts and corresponding performance analysis that Plaintiffs actually intend to rely upon at \ntrial. \nWhile neither Fairfax’s nor Spencer’s earlier reports lacked analysis altogether, they  \nboth lacked the analysis that Plaintiffs actually hope to rely upon at trial, the disclosure of \nwhich Defendants required all along in order to effectively advance their defense of this claim.  \nStated differently, Fairfax’s new districts and Spencer’s new performance analyses constitute \nentirely new opinions on fundamental elements of Plaintiffs’ claim—not a “supplement” \nreasonably contemplated within Rule 26(e). \nIII.  Application of the Bresler factors strongly militates in favor of these reports’ exclusion \nat trial and for other litigation purposes. \n \nAs recognized in Bresler v. Wilmington Trust Co., 855 F.3d 178 (4th Cir. 2017), “a \nparty who fails to comply with the expert witness disclosure rules is prohibited from ‘us[ing] \nthat information or witness to supply evidence ... at a trial, unless the failure was substantially \njustified or harmless.” Id. at 190, quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).  In evaluating whether a \nfailure to make timely disclosures is substantially justified or harmless, courts are guided by the \nfollowing factors: (1) the surprise to Defendants; (2) the Defendants’ ability to cure the \nsurprise; (3) the extent to which allowing the evidence would disrupt the trial; (4) the \nimportance of the untimely disclosed evidence; and (5) Plaintiffs’ explanation for their failure \n9 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 10 of 13 PageID# 5088\nto disclose the evidence in a timely manner. Id.  An application of these factors to the \ncircumstances surrounding Plaintiffs’ out-of-time disclosures militates in favor of excluding \nthese new analyses. \nThe first four factors relate primarily to the harmlessness exception. Id.   The last factor \ninforms the substantial justification inquiry. Id. \nWith regard to the harmlessness inquiry, the factors involving surprise, ability to cure, \nand the importance of the disclosed materials each cut decisively in Defendants’ favor.  First of \nall, Defendants’ surprise was total, as Fairfax’s original report purported to show the operative \nillustrative districts Plaintiffs sought to rely upon in litigating their claim.  Defendants had no \nidea before the close of expert discovery that such an egregious error had been made and that \nthe Plaintiffs eventually would attempt to rely upon new districts.  Defendants and their experts \nwere not able to perform any evaluation of these new districts until five months after the \ndeadline for filing dispositive motions.  In fact, Defendants knew nothing about the contours of \nthe newly proffered districts before March 16, 2020.  Stated differently, at the time Defendants \nwere required to file their summary judgment motion, they had no basis to know whether the \ndistrict that Plaintiffs actually hope to rely upon could be challenged on constitutional or other \ngrounds.  Put simply, Plaintiffs’ late change of opinions caused Defendants to fly blind. \nDefendants have worked diligently to mitigate—at least with regard to trial—the harm \ncreated by Plaintiffs’ out-of-time disclosures.  Specifically, Defendants quickly arranged, in the \nmidst of the COVID-19 pandemic, follow-up depositions of Fairfax and Spencer.  During those \ndepositions, it was confirmed that the change in Plaintiffs’ expert reports was substantial and \nrequired new analyses by both experts involved.  See, e.g., supra at 3-4.  First, Defendants \nshould not have been required to expend their time, effort, and resources towards such remedial \nefforts—resources that are clearly under strain due to lost revenue due to COVID-19.  And, of \n10 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 11 of 13 PageID# 5089\ncourse, the Plaintiffs’ failure to follow the rules is itself significant harm, as it undermines the \nfinality of the expert reports in this case (a concern raised by Ullman, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n25590, at *13-14) and leaves Defendants forced to guess at what arguments and evidence \nPlaintiffs intend to use at trial.  More critically, having now confirmed the depth of new \nanalyses required of Plaintiffs’ new disclosure, it is clear that Defendants are harmed in not \nhaving this new analysis prior to serving their rebuttal reports. \nThe importance of Fairfax’s and Spencer’s new analysis is beyond doubt.  Admittedly, \ncourts must evaluate this factor from the perspective of both parties. Rambus, Inc. v. Infineon \nTechs. AG, 145 F. Supp. 2d 721, 734 (E.D. Va. 2001).  But whatever importance Plaintiffs \nattach to these new reports, they must in equal measure concede that crucial information was \ndenied to the Defendants until it was far too late to make effective use of it in their motion for \nsummary judgment or in preparing to rebut it at trial.  It is no injustice, therefore, to deny \nPlaintiffs the use of these new analyses at trial. \nPlaintiffs’ expert (Fairfax) candidly admits his error in failing to include Ms. Allen’s \nhome address in any of his original or rebuttal illustrative districts.  As there are no factors \noutside of Plaintiffs’ control that led to this rule violation, there plainly exists no substantial \njustification for serving new expert analyses six months after the close of expert discovery.  To \nborrow the poetic language employed by Plaintiffs in a recent memorandum, “Whether it \nresulted from lethargy, negligence, or design,” Plaintiffs failure to timely produce key expert \nanalyses  “does not justify burdening” Defendants with the task of responding to these new \nanalysis in the months preceding trial—and five months after they filed their motion for \nsummary judgment. (ECF No. 154 at 8.)  The offending reports and opinions should be \nexcluded, and Plaintiffs’ witnesses should be precluded from testifying about the analysis and \nconclusions in those reports. \n11 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 161   Filed 07/22/20   Page 12 of 13 PageID# 5090\nCONCLUSION  \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that this Court, pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) and 37(c), enter an order excluding the new analyses contained in the new, \n“supplemental” expert reports of Fairfax and Spencer—specifically, the entirety of Fairfax’s \nreport and all of Spencer’s analyses of Fairfax’s newly offered districts—from use at trial or for \nany other evidentiary purpose and to grant such further relief as the Court deems proper. \n    Respectfully submitted, \n \nCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA \nBEACH CITY COUNCIL, and LOUIS \nJONES, JAMES WOOD, JESSICA ABBOTT, \nROBERT DYER, BARBARA HENLEY, \nMICHAEL BERLUCCHI, JOHN MOSS, GUY \nTOWER, AARON ROUSE, ROSEMARY \nWILSON, SABRINA WOOTEN, TOM \nLEAHY, and DONNA PATTERSON, all in \ntheir official capacities \n     \n             By: /s/ Joseph M.

Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-0069  \nCity of Virginia Beach, et al.,     \n  \nDefendants.  \n  \n \nMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO EXCLUDE \nPLAINTIFFS’ SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERT REPORTS AND OPINIONS \n \nShortly  after  Plaintiffs  challenged  Defendants’  untimely  identification  of  20  new \nwitnesses, eight months beyond the discovery deadline, and four months before trial, Defendants \nmoved to exclude two supplemental expert reports that Plaintiffs submitted on March 16, 2020, \nmore than four months ago. Defendants filed this motion even though they had not previously \nobjected to, and in the interim had deposed the experts about, those supplemental reports. If \nDefendants hope to induce the Court to trade off one motion for the other, the strategy rests on a \nradically false equivalency. \nBy waiting until May 29, 2020, to identify not one or two, but 20 new witnesses they could \nand should have identified long ago, Defendants potentially impose an enormous burden on \nPlaintiffs.1 Defendants cite no extenuating circumstance that can justify this prolonged omission. \nIn stark contrast, one of Plaintiffs’ experts, Mr. Tony Fairfax, submitted the disputed supplemental \n \n1 The Defendants identified 21 new witnesses in their third supplemental disclosures, but Plaintiffs \nhave moved to exclude only 20 of those witnesses because one, Amelia Ross-Hammond, was also \nidentified by Plaintiffs’ timely 26(a) disclosures. \n  1 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 2 of 20 PageID# 5432\nreport in March 2020 to provide and analyze demographic data not available at the time of his \nearlier reports, to reflect the new address of Plaintiff Latasha Holloway who moved after the prior \nreports, and to correct an inadvertent omission identified during his deposition by Defendants’ \nquestioning. The other expert, Dr. Doug Spencer, supplemented his report to take account of the \nnew information from Mr. Fairfax. Plaintiffs notified Defendants as soon as they became aware \nthat  Plaintiff  Holloway  had  moved  her  residence  and  that  Mr.  Fairfax  would  produce  a \nsupplemental report, and they provided the supplemental reports almost seven months before trial.  \nTo negate any conceivable prejudice, Plaintiffs—at the same time they disclosed the \nsupplemental expert reports—offered Defendants the opportunity to depose both experts. Without \nany objection, Defendants accepted that offer, deposing Dr. Spencer on June 9, 2020, and Mr. \nFairfax on June 24, 2020. Plaintiffs more than met their obligation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e) to \ncorrect or supplement the record, without prejudicing Defendants. \n  Defendants  only  began  expressing  concern  about  Plaintiffs’  so-called  “practice  of \nsupplementing  this  matter”  after  Plaintiffs  objected  to  Defendants’  seriously  delinquent \nidentification of 20 new witnesses. When Plaintiffs refused to drop their objection to this massive \nand untimely imposition in exchange for Defendants’ agreement not to object to the supplemental \nexpert reports, and then moved to exclude those witnesses, Defendants went on the offensive. The \ntimeline strongly suggests that Defendants’ motion is nothing more than a bargaining chip or \ndiversionary tactic.   \n  This Court should deny Defendants’ motion because the two supplemental expert reports \nby Mr. Fairfax and Dr. Spencer properly supplement existing opinions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e). \nIn any event, by conducting supplemental depositions of the experts, Defendants either cured any \n  2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 3 of 20 PageID# 5433\nconceivable prejudice from the supplementation, or waived any objection, or both.2 For that \nreason, too, the Court should deny Defendants’ motion to exclude the supplemental reports.  \nBACKGROUND \nOn July 15, 2019, to satisfy the standard in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), for \nproving a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, Plaintiffs submitted an expert report by \nMr. Fairfax that identified two illustrative districts in Virginia Beach with a majority Latino \n(Hispanic), Black, and Asian (“HBA”) population, demonstrating it was possible to create such a \ndistrict, ECF No. 115-1 (Fairfax Initial Report), Dr. Spencer’s initial report, submitted the same \nday, analyzed racially polarized voting in Virginia Beach, and included a performance analysis of \nMr. Fairfax’s illustrative majority-HBA districts, using recent voting patterns to demonstrate that \nthose districts would allow the HBA community to elect their candidates of choice to the City \nCouncil. ECF No. 115-6 at 32-34 (Spencer Initial Report). As required by the Court’s scheduling \norder, ECF No. 89, all three of Plaintiffs’ experts submitted rebuttal reports on August 26, 2019. \nMr. Fairfax’s rebuttal report responded to a report from Defendants’ expert Peter Morrison, and \nincluded additional illustrative majority-HBA districts. ECF No. 115-2 (Fairfax Rebuttal Report). \nDr. Spencer’s rebuttal report responded to a report from Defendants’ expert Quentin Kidd, and \nincluded an additional electoral performance analyses (including 2018 election data) of Mr. \nFairfax’s illustrative districts. ECF No. 115-7 (Spencer Rebuttal Report). Defendants deposed Mr. \n \n2 See, e.g., Ex. 1 (April 22, 2020 email to Plaintiffs’ counsel from Chris Boynton regarding \ndeposition of Dr. Spencer), Ex. 2 (May 2020 email correspondence regarding deposition of Mr. \nFairfax) (both showing no objection or reservation of rights by Defendants in relation to either of \nthe two supplemental expert reports); but see ECF No. 154-3 (Defendants, for the first time, \nreserving the right to request that the Court strike Plaintiffs’ supplemental reports if Plaintiffs \nsought Court intervention for Defendants’ untimely disclosure of 20 new witnesses). \n  3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 4 of 20 PageID# 5434\nFairfax about his initial and rebuttal expert reports on September 24, 2019. See, e.g., ECF No. 115-\n3 (Fairfax Dep.). \n  Subsequently, three events prompted two of Plaintiffs’ experts to supplement their previous \nreports. First, at Mr. Fairfax’s deposition on September 24, 2019, Defendants asked him repeatedly \nwhether both Plaintiffs were included in his illustrative districts. Their persistent questions caused \nMr. Fairfax to recheck his maps after the deposition. He realized then, for the first time, that he \nhad inadvertently excluded Plaintiff Allen (but not Plaintiff Holloway) from an illustrative district. \nECF No. 115-3 (Fairfax Dep.) at 179:19-180:22; 215:2-217:8; 223:8-13. Second, in late November \n2019, Plaintiff Holloway moved to a new address in Virginia Beach. ECF No. 161-1 (Fairfax \nSupplemental Report) at 3-4 (noting new address for Ms. Holloway). Ms. Holloway initially \ninformed Plaintiffs’ counsel that she was moving in October 2019. Plaintiffs’ counsel quickly \ninformed both Defendants and Mr. Fairfax of this new development. Although Ms. Holloway \nultimately moved to a house on the same street as her previous residence, in October 2019, she \nwas unsure exactly where or when she was moving. Thus, Plaintiffs’ counsel believed that it was \nnecessary for Mr. Fairfax to ensure that her new address remained in a majority-HBA illustrative \ndistrict. Third, on January 31, 2020, the Census Bureau released new five-year estimates from the \nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) for 2014-2018.3 \n  To provide the Court with the most accurate and helpful expert testimony, deal with the \nresidential move by Plaintiff Holloway, and confirm that it was feasible to draw a demonstrative \n \n3 Citizen Voting Age by Race and Ethnicity, 2014-2018, Census Bureau (January 31, 2020), \nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap/2014-\n2018-CVAP.html. Five-year ACS data is used by map-drawers to obtain Citizen Voting Age \nPopulation (“CVAP”) estimates, which are in turn used in building and/or assessing the racial \nbreakdown of a district. Prior to this release, the most recent five-year ACS estimates were the \n2013-2017 dataset, used by Plaintiffs’ experts in their initial and rebuttal reports. \n  4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 5 of 20 PageID# 5435\nmajority-HBA district in which both Plaintiffs reside, Mr. Fairfax modified his initial map. He also \nincluded the most up-to-date ACS data.4 Then, using the newly released 2014-2018 ACS data, Dr. \nSpencer conducted for the modified illustrative districts the same performance analysis that he did \nin his original and rebuttal reports for the illustrative districts Mr. Fairfax had previously drawn. \nBoth experts followed the same exact methods and used the same data sources as in their previous \ntwo reports. \n  On  October  24,  2019,  soon  after  learning  of  Plaintiff  Holloway’s  upcoming  move, \nPlaintiffs notified Defendants of their plan to supplement Mr. Fairfax’s report.5 Ex. 3 (Oct. 24, \n2019 email to Defs. counsel). On March 16, 2020, just six weeks after the Census Bureau’s release \nof the new ACS demographic data, Plaintiffs provided Defendants with Mr. Fairfax’s and Dr. \nSpencer’s supplemental reports, Ex. 4 (March 16, 2020 email to Defs. counsel). This was six \nmonths in advance of the September 9, 2020 deadline for supplemental disclosures. ECF No. 142 \n(Current Scheduling Order); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2) (noting “duty to supplement extends both to \ninformation included in the report and to information given during the expert’s deposition” and \n“changes . . . must be disclosed by the time the party’s pretrial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are \ndue.”). At that time, Plaintiffs also proactively offered Defendants the opportunity to schedule \nsupplemental depositions for both Mr. Fairfax and Dr. Spencer. Ex. 4. Six weeks later, on April \n22, 2020, Defendants—without objection or reservation—accepted Plaintiffs’ offer to depose Dr. \nSpencer. Ex. 1. Three weeks after that, on May 13, 2020, Defendants said they wanted to depose \n \n4 Indeed, in their recent Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants allege that this case is moot because a \nnew Census will occur in 2020. This underscores the usefulness of having the most recent five-\nyear 2014-2018 ACS data in the record. In addition, the 2014-2018 ACS data show the continuing \ntrend of a large minority population in Virginia Beach, and that even later in the decade, it is \nentirely possible to draw multiple majority-HBA districts in the city.  \n5 Plaintiff Holloway had several delays in her actual move and thus Plaintiffs’ counsel was unable \nto provide Mr. Fairfax her new address until November 19, 2019.  \n  5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 6 of 20 PageID# 5436\nMr. Fairfax as well. Ex. 2. As noted above, Dr. Spencer’s deposition occurred on June 9, 2020 and \nMr. Fairfax’s, on June 24, 2020, both via videoconference. See, e.g., Ex. 5 (Spencer Supp. Dep.); \nEx. 6 (Fairfax Supp. Dep.). \n  On May 29, 2020, eight months after the September 3, 2019 discovery deadline, ECF No. \n104, Defendants served Plaintiffs with a third supplement to their initial disclosures, identifying \n20 new witnesses they may rely on at trial. Plaintiffs properly and promptly objected to the new \nwitness disclosures, ECF No. 154-2 (Pls. June 8, 2020 letter). Defendants responded on June 10, \n2020,  the  day  after  they  deposed  Dr.  Spencer,  claiming  for  the  first  time  that  Plaintiffs’ \nsupplemental expert disclosures were improper. ECF No. 154-3 (Defs. June 10, 2020 letter). \nNotably, Defendants waited to register this objection until six weeks after they agreed to depose \nthe two experts, 12 weeks after Plaintiffs submitted the supplemental reports, seven months after \nPlaintiffs initially notified them that supplemental testimony was coming, and only after deposing \none of Plaintiffs’ experts about his supplemental report. When Plaintiffs declined to engage in this \nlopsided trade, Defendants moved to exclude the supplemental reports. See ECF No. 162 at 3 \n(Defendants noting that they suggested the parties “stand-down” and rescind their respective \nsupplementation disputes).  \n  Plaintiffs’ disclosures were thus proper under the federal rules. Further, Defendants, \nwithout objection, already took advantage of the opportunity to depose the witnesses regarding \nthose disclosures, which cured any possible prejudice and waived any challenge. The Court \ntherefore should deny Defendants’ motion.  \n   \n  6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 7 of 20 PageID# 5437\nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Supplemental Expert Reports Were Proper Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).  \nA.  The supplemental expert reports fulfilled Plaintiffs’ obligation under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(e) to supplement and correct the record. \n \n  The supplemental expert reports from Mr. Fairfax and Dr. Spencer fulfilled Plaintiffs’ \nobligation to supplement and correct the record under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e), which authorizes—\nand requires—a party to “supplement or correct its disclosure in a timely manner if the party learns \nthat in some material respect the disclosure . . . is incomplete or incorrect.” As the Fourth Circuit \nhas explained, “Rule 26(e) envisions supplementation to add additional or corrective information.” \nCampbell v. United States, 470 F. App’x 153, 157 (4th Cir. 2012); see also EEOC v. Freedman, \n961 F. Supp. 2d 783, 797 (D. Md. 2013) (“Supplementation under the Rules means correcting \ninaccuracies, or filling the interstices of an incomplete report based on information that was not \navailable at the time of the initial disclosure.”) (citation omitted). Rule 26(e) explicitly applies to \nexpert disclosures: \nExpert  Witness.  For  an  expert  whose  report  must  be  disclosed  under  Rule \n26(a)(2)(B), the party’s duty to supplement extends both to information included \nin  the report and to  information given during the expert’s deposition. Any \nadditions or changes to this information must be disclosed by the time the party’s \npretrial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due. \n   \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2). \n  Mr. Fairfax’s and Dr. Spencer’s supplemental reports comply with the plain language of \nRule 26(e). The reports incorporate census data that were unavailable prior to close of expert \ndiscovery, take account of the new address Plaintiff Holloway moved to in November 2019, \ncorrect for an inadvertent omission in Mr. Fairfax’s original report regarding Ms. Allen’s address \n  7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 8 of 20 PageID# 5438\nand correct deposition testimony. In other words, the reports properly “add[ed] additional [and] \ncorrective information.” Campbell, 470 F. App’x at 157.  \nFirst, Mr. Fairfax and Dr. Spencer both incorporated new information that was unavailable \nwhen they submitted their initial and rebuttal reports. Specifically, both experts used the most \nrecent 5-year 2014-2018 ACS dataset to provide up-to-date determinations on the size, geographic \ncompactness, and political cohesiveness of Plaintiffs’ demonstrative districts. ECF No. 161-1 \n(Fairfax Supp. Report) at 2. The Census Bureau did not release this dataset until January 31, 2020, \nnearly four months after expert discovery closed on October 1, 2019, ECF No. 104 (Scheduling \nOrder). Mr. Fairfax also updated his maps to identify Plaintiff Holloway’s new address, confirming \nthat she remained within a majority-HBA district after moving in late 2019, again after the close \nof expert discovery.6 In addition, Mr. Fairfax’s supplemental report corrected the inadvertent \nomission of Ms. Allen’s residence in the demonstrative districts in his initial and rebuttal reports. \nThough Mr. Fairfax included both Ms. Holloway and Ms. Allen in his demonstrative districts \nattached to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, ECF No. 62 at 18, he inadvertently omitted Ms. \nAllen’s address from a demonstrative majority-HBA district when he modified his map for his \ninitial report. Ex. 6 (Fairfax Supp. Dep.) at 16:5-10.7 After Defendants’ questioning called \nattention to this omission during Mr. Fairfax’s deposition, he looked into the Plaintiffs’ addresses \n \n6 Even with her new address, Ms. Holloway’s residence has always been in a majority-HBACVAP \ndistrict in all of Mr. Fairfax’s plans. ECF No. 161-1 (Fairfax Supp. Report) at 5. \n7 It is clear that Mr. Fairfax thought both Plaintiffs were included in all demonstrative districts \nprovided in his initial and rebuttal reports. As mentioned above, Mr. Fairfax included both \nPlaintiffs in the demonstrative map attached as Appendix A in the Amended Complaint, and the \nDefendants questioned him extensively about this map at his deposition. ECF No. 62 (Amended \nComplaint) at 18; ECF No. 115-3 (Fairfax Dep.) at 105:19-109:21; 110:10-112:9; 216:1-217:8. \nHe amended the map in Appendix A to account for the new 2013-2017 ACS data. Id. At that point, \nMr. Fairfax believed that both Plaintiffs’ addresses were included in the demonstrative districts. \nSee, e.g., ECF No. 115-3 (Fairfax Dep.) at 179:19-180:22; 215:1-217:9; 228:6-12. \n  8 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 9 of 20 PageID# 5439\nin relation to the illustrative districts and generated a supplemental report, concluding (again) that \nit was feasible to include Ms. Allen’s address in a majority-HBA district. ECF No. 161-1 (Fairfax \nSupp. Report) at 6. To do so, Mr. Fairfax made some “minimal modifications” to one corner of \nthe district in his initial map—the kind of adjustment that is commonplace in map-drawing. Ex. 6 \n(Fairfax Supp. Dep.) at 12-14; ECF No. 161-1 (Fairfax Supp. Report) at 3 (identifying changes as \n“minor  modifications  and  insignificant  district  statistical  alterations”),  6  (noting  that  the \n“Illustrative Plan, Alternative Plan 1, and Alternative Plan 2 were easily modified to include \nGeorgia Allen” and that “Ms. Allen’s address was in close proximity to majority-HBACVAP8 \nDistrict 2 in many of the plans in my initial and rebuttal reports”), 12 (“at least one majority-\nHBACVAP district can be easily drawn that contains both Plaintiffs’ residences”). As Mr. Fairfax \nexplained in the Defendants’ deposition of him focusing entirely on the supplemental reports, these \nmodifications did not significantly change how the majority-HBA districts performed based on \ntraditional redistricting criteria, Ex. 6 (Fairfax Supp. Dep.) at 28:7-14, and in fact, “most of the \ndistricts [in the map] did not change” at all. Id. at 18:15-16.9 \nDr. Spencer’s supplemental report reflected an electoral performance analysis of Mr. \nFairfax’s modified demonstrative districts, which, logically, could only be available after Mr. \nFairfax created them using the new data.10 ECF No. 161-2 (Spencer Supp. Report). Defendants \nfalsely claim that Dr. Spencer conducted “an entirely new analysis.” See Defs. Mem. at 5. He did \n \n8 Hispanic/Latino, Black, and Asian Citizen Voting Age Population. \n9 Notably, District 1 in all of the plans drawn by Mr. Fairfax did not change at all. Only District 2 \nwas modified. ECF No. 161-1 (Fairfax Supp. Report) at 6. \n10 There is also a short section in the report that makes a clarification. In his initial deposition, \nDr. Spencer answered a question about two candidates in a 2010 election, but reserved the right \nto check the lack statistical significance of these two data points before confirming that answer. \nIn his supplemental report he reported that he had checked, as he said he would, and confirmed \nthat the difference between the two data points was not statistically significant. \n  9 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 10 of 20 PageID# 5440\nnothing of the kind. The performance analysis and methodology utilized by Dr. Spencer in all three \nof his reports are exactly the same, except for the use of the newly available 2014-2018 ACS data, \nand Dr. Spencer’s opinions remain the same throughout. In his initial and rebuttal reports, Dr. \nSpencer first compared voter support for each of the minority candidates of choice who lost \nbetween 2008 and 2018 to the minority CVAP in each of the illustrative districts. ECF No. 115-6 \n(Spencer Initial Report) at 32-34; ECF No. 115-7 (Spencer Rebuttal Report) at 10, 16; ECF No. \n161-2  at  6.  He  disaggregated  the  election  results  for  candidates  of  choice  of  the  minority \ncommunity into lower geographical units and then aggregated those votes into the modified \nillustrative majority-HBA districts. With these aggregated numbers, he determined whether a \nminority candidate of choice would likely win or lose in the illustrative districts drawn by Mr. \nFairfax. Id. Dr. Spencer undertook the same analysis of Mr. Fairfax’s modified districts in his \nsupplemental report. ECF No. 161-2 (Spencer Supp. Report) at 4-15. In all three reports (initial, \nrebuttal and supplemental), Dr. Spencer concluded that minority voters in Virginia Beach would \nbe more likely to elect candidates of their choice in Mr. Fairfax’s illustrative districts than under \nthe current at-large system. Id.; ECF No. 115-6 at 32-34; ECF No. 115-7 at 10, 16. \nDefendants are no more faithful to the facts in asserting that Dr. Spencer “used the occasion \nof Fairfax’s supplemental report to perform an entire type of analysis that he had neglected to \nperform as to Fairfax’s illustrative districts when they were initially disclosed in Fairfax’s rebuttal \nreport.” Defs. Mem. at 4. First, Mr. Fairfax “initially disclosed” his illustrative districts in his \ninitial, not his rebuttal, report. Second, Dr. Spencer included a performance analysis of these \ndistricts in both his initial and rebuttal reports. See, e.g., ECF No. 115-6 (Spencer Initial Report) \nat 32-34; ECF No. 115-7 (Spencer Rebuttal Report) at 10, 16. Third, the modified districts in Mr. \nFairfax’s supplemental report were a distinct disclosure to correct and supplement his initial \n  10 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 11 of 20 PageID# 5441\nreports. And logically, Dr. Spencer could only conduct his performance analysis of the modified \ndistricts once they existed. \n  Finally, Defendants’ reliance on Akeva L.L.C. v. Mizuno Corporation, 212 F.R.D. 306 \n(M.D.N.C. Dec. 20, 2002), is misplaced. In Akeva, the court rejected a supplemental report because \nthe expert had “conduct[ed] another type of test,” that did not appear in the initial report. Id. at 310 \n(emphasis added). Here, Plaintiffs’ experts used the same tests and methodologies to update their \ninitial reports to correct a minor error and incorporate newly available information. These are the \nkinds of supplemental disclosures contemplated under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e). \nB.  Plaintiffs’ disclosure of the supplemental export reports was timely under Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 26(e)(2).  \n \n  Plaintiffs’ disclosure of supplemental export reports was timely under the plain language \nof Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2), which provides that supplementations to “information included in [an \nexpert’s] report and to information given during the expert’s deposition” must be disclosed “by \nthe time the party’s pretrial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due.” See N.O. v. Alembik, No. \n1:15-cv-868, 2016 WL 1388777, at *2 (E.D. Va. Jan. 15, 2016) (supplemental expert disclosures \nprovided before the deadline for pretrial disclosures are “timely” within the meaning of Rule \n26(e)). The Rule 26(a)(3) deadline in this case is September 9, 2020. ECF No. 142 (Current \nScheduling Order). Plaintiffs served the two supplemental reports at issue nearly six months before \nthis deadline, on March 16, 2020. Ex. 4 (March 16, 2020 email to Defs. Counsel), and only 45 \ndays after the Census Bureau released its new ACS data. The supplemental reports were thus \ntimely. \n  Further, even though there is no advance notice requirement for serving supplemental \nexpert reports, Plaintiffs promptly notified Defendants on October 24, 2019 that Mr. Fairfax’s \nsupplemental report would be forthcoming. Ex. 3. Plaintiffs also notified Defendants that Ms. \n  11 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 12 of 20 PageID# 5442\nHolloway would be moving, and that the supplemental report would reflect her new address as \nsoon as it was available.11 Id. In sum, Plaintiffs not only disclosed the supplemental reports well \nin advance of the discovery deadline, they also provided Defendants with an additional five \nmonths’ notice of the disclosure. At no point during this entire period, or any time before Plaintiffs \nexpressed concern about Defendants’ 20 untimely witnesses, did Defendants reserve the right to \nobject to Plaintiffs’ supplementation.  \nII.  Even if Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Expert Reports Were Deemed Untimely, the Court \nShould Allow Their Use Because They Are Both Substantially Justified and Harmless.  \n \n  Even if the Court were to find Plaintiffs’ supplemental expert reports untimely under Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 26(e), it should permit their use at trial and for evidentiary purposes. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n37(c) provides that, “[i]f a party fails to provide information . . . as required by Rule 26(a) or (e),” \nthe party may use that information to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial if “the \nfailure was substantially justified or is harmless.” Courts consider five factors in determining \nwhether an untimely disclosure is substantially justified or harmless under Rule 37, including: \n(1) the surprise to the party against whom the evidence would be offered; (2) the \nability of that party to cure the surprise; (3) the extent to which allowing the \nevidence would disrupt the trial; (4) the importance of the evidence; and (5) the \nnondisclosing party's explanation for its failure to disclose the evidence. \n \nS. States Rack & Fixture, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 318 F.3d 592, 597 (4th Cir. 2003); Factory \nMut. Ins. Co. v. DLR Contracting, Inc., No. 3:04CV834, 2005 WL 2704502, at *14 (E.D. Va. Oct. \n20, 2005); Swimways Corp. & Vap Creative, Ltd. v. Zuru, Inc., No. 2:13–cv–334, 2014 WL \n12573390, at *3 n.2 (E.D. Va. July 10, 2014).    \n  As Defendants note, “the first four factors relate primarily to the harmlessness exception” \nand the “last factor informs the substantial justification inquiry.” Defs. Mem. at 10. A court need \n \n11 See n.5.  \n  12 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 13 of 20 PageID# 5443\nnot “tick through each of the [] factors,” Wilkins v. Montgomery, 751 F.3d 214, 222 (4th Cir. 2014), \nand a disclosure can be proper under Rule 37 without meeting all of them. See, e.g., Worldwide \nNetwork Servs., LLC v. Dyncorp Int'l, LLC, 365 F. App'x 432, 445 (4th Cir. 2010) (finding \nplaintiff’s  Rule  26  violation  justified  even  though  defendant  “was  surprised”  by  the  new \ntestimony). Plaintiffs’ supplemental reports meet this test. There was no surprise to Defendants. \nEven if they could claim surprise, Defendants already cured it by deposing Plaintiffs experts. The \nsupplemental  reports  can  cause  no  disruption  for  trial.  The  up-to-date  information  in  the \nsupplemental reports will be useful for this Court in that it includes the most recent five-year ACS \nCVAP estimates. And the only reason the information was disclosed after the discovery deadline \nis that it was not known or did not yet exist.  \nA.  Plaintiffs’ disclosures are harmless. \n  The “harmlessness” factors largely reflect two propositions that are as compelling in \nlitigation as they are on the playground: Parties cannot complain unless they are hurt, and parties \ncannot begin complaining after they have accepted the offer of amends. Here, Defendants do both. \nThey seek relief for a non-existent injury, after they already availed themselves of the remedy, \nwhich need not have been offered in any event. \n  Defendants claim that their “surprise was total,” and that they “had no idea before the close \nof expert discovery” of Plaintiff Allen’s omission from the demonstrative districts in Mr. Fairfax’s \ninitial reports. Defs. Mem. at 10. This claim is not credible. At Mr. Fairfax’s September 24, 2019 \ndeposition,  Defendants  asked  him  five  times  whether  both  Plaintiffs  were  included  in  the \nillustrative districts. The questioning strongly suggested that Defendants believed there was an \nomission. In fact, the implication was so strong that it prompted Mr. Fairfax to double check \nwhether Plaintiff Allen resided in his illustrative districts, whereupon he realized that “one of [the \n  13 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 14 of 20 PageID# 5444\nPlaintiffs] may be out.”12 ECF No. 115-3 (Fairfax Dep.) at 223:13. Further, as noted above, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel contacted Defendants on October 24, 2019 to inform them that Ms. Holloway \nwas moving, and that they would file a supplemental expert report addressing both Plaintiffs’ \nresidences.  Ex. 3.  Finally,  both  supplemental reports are entirely  consistent  with Plaintiffs’ \nposition and expert opinions since the outset of this case, i.e. that the residences of Ms. Holloway \nand Ms. Allen are within majority-HBA illustrative districts. See In re Mercedes-Benz, No. 99–\n4311, 2006 WL 2129100, at *9 (D.N.J. July 26, 2006) (holding that defendants “cannot now claim \nto be surprised” by new information “because that information is entirely consistent with plaintiffs’ \nposition throughout this litigation.”).  \n  Regardless, by deposing both experts a second time, Defendants cured any surprise they \nmay have experienced. Defendants claim they had to “work[] diligently to mitigate . . . harm” \ncaused by the supplemental disclosures, “quickly arrang[ing], in the midst of the COVID-19 \npandemic, follow up depositions of Fairfax and Spencer.” Defs. Mem. at 10. But Plaintiffs \nproactively offered the depositions to the Defendants, and Defendants did not once object to the \nsupplementation or any other aspect of the procedure—not when Plaintiffs initially notified them \nthat the supplements would be forthcoming, and not when Plaintiffs actually disclosed the reports. \nIn fact, Defendants only indicated their desire to depose Dr. Spencer six weeks after receiving his \nsupplemental expert report, Ex. 1, and did not inform Plaintiffs of their wish to depose Mr. Fairfax \nuntil May 13, 2020. Ex. 2. Further, the depositions over videoconference were arranged, and \nDefendants had three months to prepare for the depositions from the time they received the \nsupplemental reports.   \n \n12 Ex. 3 at 180:4-8, 215:8-17, 217:3-4, 223:8-10, 228:6-8. \n  14 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 15 of 20 PageID# 5445\n  This Court has found the untimely opinion of a plaintiffs’ expert witness admissible, in \npart because defendants’ “‘opportunity to fully depose [the expert witness], and explore the full \nnature of his opinions’ . . . eliminated any surprise, cured any defect, and substantially reduced or \noutright eliminated any prejudice to defendants.” Alembik, 2016 WL 1388777, at *2 (quoting \nBarta v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 307 F. Supp. 2d 773, 783 (E.D. Va. 2004)). In case after case, \ncourts have ordered depositions as a remedy for an allegedly late expert disclosure. See, e.g., Deal \nv. Louisiana ex rel. Dep't of Justice, No. 11-743, 2014 WL 5363966 (M.D. La. Oct. 21, 2014) \n(declining to exclude a supplemental report where the party that provided the supplement made \nthe expert available for a deposition); In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., No. 3:07-cv-\n05944SC, 2015 WL 13756254, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2015) (same). Though not required here, \nPlaintiffs offered that option in October 2019, and Defendants took advantage of it, deposing both \nof Plaintiffs’ experts in June 2020. Only after those depositions, and after Plaintiffs’ motion to \nexclude the 20 new witnesses was filed, did Defendants profess surprise and object to the \nsupplemental reports.  \n  Nevertheless, Defendants assert an outstanding injury “in not having this new analysis prior \nto serving their rebuttal reports.” Defs. Mem. at 11. Defendants even present a wish list of analyses \ntheir experts would have performed had they only had the chance. Id. at 5. This claim is \nimplausible. Defendants could have conducted these analyses prior to the close of expert discovery \n– they simply chose not to. The analyses address the aggregation techniques and methodology \nemployed by Plaintiffs’ experts, and both experts used the same techniques and methodology in \ntheir supplemental report as in their initial report. Thus, unlike the plaintiff in Ullman v. Auto-\nOwners Mutual Insurance Co., No. 2:05-cv-1000, 2007 WL 1057397 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 5, 2007) on \nwhich they rely,  Defendants  are in  no different  a position now than they were before the \n  15 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 16 of 20 PageID# 5446\nsupplemental reports.13 Plaintiffs’ experts similarly made no new “assumptions about data” in the \nsupplemental reports. They simply updated their datasets to include the most recent and previously \nunavailable five-year 2014-2018 ACS data. The findings of Plaintiffs’ experts regarding “the \ncohesiveness of African American, Asian and Hispanic voters” also have not changed. Defs. Mem. \nat 5. And Dr. Kidd’s decision to rely entirely on Dr. Spencer’s analysis of cohesion is immaterial, \nas Spencer’s supplemental report does not address cohesion. It concerns only his performance \nanalysis on the modified districts.14 That performance analysis focused on whether minority \ncandidates prevailed in the illustrative districts, not whether black, Hispanic and Asian voters voted \ntogether and were politically cohesive. Neither of Defendants’ two expert witnesses in their expert \nreports or at their depositions challenged Dr. Spencer’s performance analysis; nor did they conduct \nany independent analyses of their own (they merely critiqued plaintiffs’ expert reports). Having \nnot conducted the analysis when the district contained one plaintiff, Defendants are not credible in \nclaiming that they would have done so when it contained both. See, e.g., ECF No. 118-8 (Kidd \nReport); ECF No. 118-5 (Kidd Dep.); Ex. 7 (Morrison Report); Ex. 8 (Morrison Dep.).15   \n \n13 Dr. Spencer used a “spatial join” process to aggregated Census block data in his initial, rebuttal, \nand supplemental reports. See, e.g., ECF No. 115-6 (Spencer Initial Report) at 38; ECF No. 115-7 \n(Spencer Rebuttal Report) at 10, 16; Ex. 5 (Spencer Supp. Dep.) at 47:11-24. Mr. Fairfax used the \nMaptitude for Redistricting program to disaggregate and reaggregate block data in the initial, \nrebuttal, and supplemental reports. ECF No. 151-1(Fairfax Initial Report) at 4; ECF No. 115-2 \n(Fairfax Rebuttal Report) at 3; Ex. 6 (Fairfax Supp. Dep.) at 47:16-51:13. The process for creating \ntheir respective reports did not change. Instead, Mr. Fairfax used new information – the new ACS \ndata and Ms. Allen’s correct address – to draw new illustrative districts. Dr. Spencer then used \nnew information – Mr. Fairfax’s new illustrative districts – to confirm that his previous conclusion \ndid not change as a result of Mr. Fairfax’s new maps.  \n14 Indeed, Dr. Kidd has no expertise on the methodology for conducting racially polarized voting \nanalysis. ECF No. 118-5 (Kidd Dep.) at 37:16-38:13. He did not even attempt to calculate his own \nhomogenous precinct, ecological regression, or ecological inferences estimates, id. at 52:1-9, and \nhe did not even open the file Dr. Spencer produced containing his estimates. Id. at 53:6-18. \n15 Mr. Morrison never included any opinions about VTD splits, compactness, equal population, or \nany other district statistic besides HBACVAP and the method for calculating it in his report. Ex. \n7 (Morrison Report). Thus, it is beyond belief for Defendants to claim that if Mr. Fairfax’s districts \n  16 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 17 of 20 PageID# 5447\n  Defendants also make much of their perceived lost opportunity to file a motion for \nsummary judgment based on information in Plaintiffs’ supplemental reports, but this claim is \nillogical. Plaintiffs’ initial and rebuttal reports demonstrated that at least Ms. Holloway resides in \na majority-HBA district that is “sufficiently large and compact.” Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421, \n426 (4th Cir. 2004) (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51)). Thus, regardless of the supplemental \nreports, Plaintiff Holloway has always demonstrated that her claim meets Gingles prong 1. \nDefendants did not move for summary judgment on Gingles prong 1 previously. Their motion for \nsummary judgment focused entirely on prongs 2 and 3 (political cohesion of minority voters and \nwhether whites vote as a bloc to usually defeat minority candidates of choice), and did not \nchallenge any evidence under Gingles prong 1. ECF No. 115 (Defs. Mot. for Summ. J.). As Ms. \nHolloway’s position as to Gingles prong 1 has not changed, it is not credible that Defendants would \nmove for summary judgment with regard to her standing now. And it would have made no sense, \nand still would make no sense, to move only as to Plaintiff Allen, because regardless of any ruling \nas to her, the case would still satisfy Gingles prong 1 because of Ms. Holloway’s standing. Further, \nif, as Defendants claim, they believed Ms. Allen was included in one of Mr. Fairfax’s illustrative \ndistricts, there was no reason to refrain from moving for summary judgment if they thought they \nhad a viable argument. And if they did not think she was included, then there was no reason to \nrefrain from moving on that ground. Defendants’ inertia is not evidence of injury resulting from \nPlaintiffs’ disclosure.16  \n \nhad originally included Ms. Allen’s address (like all experts thought they did), he would have done \nso. Further, Mr. Morrison actually did not perform a large chunk of the “analysis” he did provide. \nSee, e.g., Ex. 8 (Morrison Dep.) at 129:1-137:9. \n16 Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on October 22, 2019. ECF No. 114. Two days \nlater, Plaintiffs notified Defendants that they will be providing supplemental expert reports. In \ntheir reply in support to their motion for summary judgment, Defendants did not express concern \nabout the then forthcoming supplemental reports.  \n  17 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 18 of 20 PageID# 5448\n  Plaintiffs’ supplemental reports were harmless with respect to the final two factors as well. \nThe supplemental reports could not disrupt, or even threaten to disrupt, the trial since it was still \nseven months away when the new reports were submitted. If anything, the most recent CVAP data \nwill allow the Court to conclude that all three Gingles factors remain satisfied, even with more \nrecent data available. The reports also clarify that, as explained in the Complaint, Plaintiff Allen’s \nresidence  can  be  included  in  the  demonstrative  majority-HBA  district  that  includes  Ms. \nHolloway’s (new and old) address(es). Moreover,  that this district  includes  both  Plaintiffs’ \nresidences in it is not separately important to Defendants because Plaintiff Holloway is included \nin the district in all of the illustrative maps from Mr. Fairfax’s initial and rebuttal reports. In other \nwords, since Plaintiff Holloway has standing, there is no need for the court to assess whether \nanyone else does. In sum, Plaintiffs’ disclosures are harmless under each of the relevant factors. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ disclosures are substantially justified. \n  Plaintiffs’ disclosures are justified given the circumstances. With respect to the new ACS \ndata and Ms. Holloway’s unexpected change of residence, Plaintiffs’ experts promptly updated \ntheir reports to respond to changed circumstances beyond their control. The Census Bureau did \nnot release the 2014-2018 ACS estimates until January 31, 2020, nearly four months after the close \nof expert discovery. And Ms. Holloway moved unexpectedly in late 2019, again after the close of \nexpert discovery. Mr. Fairfax’s omission of Ms. Allen from his initial demonstrative districts was \na genuine accidental omission, missing her address by only a few blocks, and Mr. Fairfax worked \nswiftly to correct his omission after Defendants’ repeated questioning brought it to his attention. \n   \n  18 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 166   Filed 08/05/20   Page 19 of 20 PageID# 5449\nCONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs supplemental expert reports are appropriate and timely under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(e). The timing of Defendants’ motion suggests that it is purely tactical, devoid of substance. \nDefendants waited months to file an objection to these disclosures, until after they had already \nremedied any conceivable harm by deposing both experts a second time, and only after Plaintiffs \nobjected to the Defendants’ untimely disclosure of 20 new witnesses 10 weeks before trial.  \nAccordingly, this Court should deny Defendant’s motion to exclude. \nDated: August 5, 2020 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nRuth M.

      "text": "Case 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 1 of 15 PageID# 5885\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA \nNORFOLK DIVISION \n \n \n \n \n \nv.  Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-0069 \n \nDefendants. \n \nDEFENDANTS’ REPLY TO PLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO EXCLUDE PLAINTIFFS’ SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERT \nREPORTS AND OPINIONS \n \nIn their memorandum in opposition (“Plaintiffs’ Brief”) to Defendants’ Motion to \nExclude, Plaintiffs argue that their grossly out-of-time supplemental expert reports and \nopinions constitute garden-variety corrections pursuant to Rule 26(e)—and thus are subject \nto the deadlines set forth in Rule 26(a)(3).  Plaintiffs also argue that, in any case, Defendants \nare not prejudiced by disclosures of key expert opinions and analyses that came six months \nafter the close of expert discovery. These arguments rest on an extraordinary premise that, \nthough never expressly stated, rings loud throughout Plaintiffs’ Brief: that with respect to the \nillustrative plans that Plaintiffs actually intend to proffer at trial, key details of these plans—\nsuch as voting district contours and demographics, whether Plaintiff Georgia Allen resides in \none of the illustrative districts, and data regarding how given districts ‘perform’ in \nelections—all are mere trifles.  In Plaintiffs’ view, it is enough that they had previously \noffered expert opinions on these matters as to other, now abandoned districts that were \ndrawn with a supposedly similar methodology.  Because expert opinions on these very issues \nare central to a vote dilution claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act—as Plaintiffs no \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 2 of 15 PageID# 5886\ndoubt are aware—their argument that these are routine supplements that do not prejudice \nDefendants is entirely without merit. \nPlaintiffs’ Brief also addresses at length a minor detail included in Anthony Fairfax’s \nso-called “supplemental” report: his confirmation that Plaintiff Latasha Holloway’s new \naddress remains in Fairfax’s original illustrative district. It must be noted that Defendants \nmade no objection to the supplementation of Holloway’s new address, nor did they raise this \ntopic in their memorandum in support.  Although there is no dispute in this regard, Plaintiffs’ \ndiscussion of the Holloway supplementation is nevertheless quite useful in that it provides as \ncontrast an example of expert supplementation that properly falls within the scope of Rule \n26(e).  In short, Plaintiffs’ Holloway-related supplementation (a new address that doesn’t \nchange the illustrative or alternative districts) stands in sharp contrast both to Fairfax’s using \n“supplementation” of wholly new district maps incorporating Plaintiff Allen’s long-standing \naddress and to Spencer’s “supplementation” of new performance analyses of Fairfax’s brand \nnew maps.  Neither of Plaintiffs’ supplemental reports were provided to Defendants’ experts \nbefore their expert reports came due. \nPlaintiffs’ Brief also repeatedly invites a comparison between their out-of-time expert \ndisclosures and Defendants’ disclosure of 20 fact witnesses, to which Plaintiffs object.  This \nis an odd strategy on Plaintiffs’ part,  as it highlights their gamesmanship—seeking on the \none hand to hold against Defendants their efforts at mitigating the harms caused by Plaintiffs’ \nuntimely disclosures, while at the same time asking the Court to reward their indolence in \nmaking no effort to mitigate the harms they contend they have suffered. \nPlaintiffs’ Brief candidly acknowledges that Fairfax’s failure to draw any illustrative \ndistrict that included Plaintiff Allen’s residence address was his error alone.  Moreover, \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 3 of 15 PageID# 5887\nPlaintiffs offer no explanation for why, after being alerted to this error at his September 2019 \ndeposition, Plaintiffs did not serve upon Defendants the allegedly corrective supplemental \nreports for another six months.  Nor have Plaintiffs explained Spencer’s failure to conduct or \ndisclose performance analyses of any of the districts Fairfax disclosed in his rebuttal report or \nwhy he should be allowed to cure that omission with a supplemental report necessitated by \nFairfax’s inexplicable prior error.  \nPlaintiffs acknowledge that courts evaluate the admissibility of out-of-time \ndisclosures by evaluating both the prejudice borne by the receiving party and the justification \nfor the offering party’s late disclosure.  Plaintiffs’ Brief unwittingly demonstrates that both \nconsiderations militate strongly in favor of the exclusion of these so-called ‘supplemental’ \nexpert reports. \n \nARGUMENT  \n \n \nI.  Plaintiffs’ characterization of their out-of-time disclosures as mere corrections \nof error or omission pursuant to Rule 26(e) disregards the scope, content and \nnature of the expert reports at issue.  \nPlaintiffs labor to cast their experts’ supplemental reports as constituting only minor \namendments that are governed by Rule 26(e)’s duty to supplement—and thus subject to the \nSeptember 9, 2020 deadline provided by the Court, pursuant to Rule 26(a)(3). Plaintiffs’ Brief \nat 11.  They contend that because “Plaintiffs’ experts used the same tests and methodologies to \nupdate their initial reports to correct a minor error,” they have not fundamentally altered their \noriginal reports.  Plaintiffs’ Brief at 11 (emphasis original).  If these amendments could \nreasonably be deemed “minor changes,” Plaintiffs’ analysis would be correct.  However, both \nsupplements contain fundamental alterations to the original and rebuttal expert opinions and \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 4 of 15 PageID# 5888\nanalyses offered by these two experts, and accordingly go far beyond the scope of changes \nallowed by supplement under Rule 26(e). \nAs a preliminary matter, the fallacy of Plaintiffs’ underlying logic is demonstrated by a \nsimple hypothetical.  Consider an expert in a products liability case who realizes that he has \naccidentally performed tests on the brake system of the wrong model automobile.  By the \nPlaintiffs’ logic, so long as the expert employed the “same methodology” and reached a \n“consistent conclusion,” his supplementation of his erroneous initial report—with testing \nanalysis performed on the correct model’s brake system—would constitute a minor correction \nof an error as contemplated by Rule 26(e) and not a fundamentally new analysis. \nTo be sure, an analysis of the brake system on the wrong model car might, in some \nsense, be thought of as a simple error. Quite obviously, though, it is also a fundamental error—\nrequiring as it does a new analysis to be performed.  Such is the case with Fairfax’s simple \nerror of not including Plaintiff Allen’s address in an illustrative district: it is also a fundamental \nerror that required both him and Douglas Spencer to perform new analyses based upon new \ndistrict maps.1  \nBy focusing on the alleged sameness of the general methodologies and conclusions, \nPlaintiffs miss the critical point that an expert’s analysis and opinions are not subject to critique \nmerely based upon the type of methodology employed, but also based upon the specific \napplication of and conclusions reached by the methodology in question.  One party’s expert \nmight well agree that an opposing expert used the correct type of method or technique, but still \n \n1 By itself, the change from offering an illustrative map that does not place Plaintiff Allen in a \nmajority-minority district to a map that does place her in such a district constitutes a legally \nsignificant change of opinion in the context of a Section 2 Voting Right Act claim.  Plaintiffs’ \ntacitly admit the importance of this central fact by having directed Fairfax to redraw all of his \nillustrative maps to include her address. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 5 of 15 PageID# 5889\nchallenge the skill, accuracy, and legitimacy of the method’s application.  Applying this \nprinciple to the present case, even assuming arguendo that Defendants agreed Fairfax and \nSpencer used proper methodologies and applied those methods properly in their initial reports, \nthat would by no means constitute a ‘blessing’ of any subsequent applications of such \nmethodologies—as Plaintiffs unmistakably suggest. \nFurthermore, when it comes to the unique craft of drawing district maps, as Fairfax was \ncharged with doing, there simply is no such thing as using the “same methodology.” As is \nevident from Fairfax’s description of his process, there are many variables involved in drawing \nvoting districts that pass constitutional and Voting Rights Act standards and adhere to whatever \nother requirements may be present.  As Fairfax’s explanation in deposition testimony \ndemonstrates, drawing an illustrative district that included Allen’s address required him to \nmodify numerous areas of the proposed districts, split various block groups and voter \ntabulation districts (“VTDs”), and incorporate traditional districting criteria (presumably \nConstitutional districting standards). Ex. 3, 13:16-14:25, 17:1-8. Fairfax also acknowledged \nthat it was necessary to modify adjacent districts as well. Ex. 3, 18:3-8. Simply put, Fairfax’s \nsupplemental report disclosed a completely new set of illustrative district maps. \nSo while Fairfax may have been following the same general methodology when he \ndrew new districts for his supplemental report, he could not simply plug in new inputs in a rote \nmanner and get a predetermined outcome. Numerous judgment calls and creative decisions are \nnecessarily involved in creating a district map that a given expert contends satisfies all \napplicable criteria.  These judgment calls are not the trifling details Plaintiffs portray them as; \nthey frequently are the very basis for dispute in all manner of voting rights cases. The judgment \ncalls Fairfax made in producing new maps are subject to scrutiny. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 6 of 15 PageID# 5890\nPlaintiffs also candidly acknowledge that Fairfax’s drawing of new district maps \nresulted in Spencer performing wholly new performance analyses for districts that—for the \nfirst time—actually contained Plaintiff Allen’s residential address.  Importantly, Spencer did \nnot previously perform a performance analysis of the five alternative district maps that Fairfax \ndisclosed in his rebuttal report.  Yet Plaintiffs refuse to concede that Spencer’s processing of \n“new data” (from illustrative districts that did not previously exist) to derive new voter support \ndatapoints (see Ex. 2) constitutes a new analysis. Plaintiffs’ Brief at 9-10.  Plaintiffs admit that \nSpencer “logically” could only perform the proper “electoral performance analysis” once he \nhad possession of Fairfax’s new districts. Plaintiffs’ Brief at 11.  But while this fact seemingly \nabsolves Spencer of personal fault, it does not alter the fundamentally new nature of his so-\ncalled “supplements.” Plaintiffs gloss over the reality that Spencer entirely omitted from his \nearlier (rebuttal) report any performance analysis of the five (5) alternative district maps \nFairfax provided in his rebuttal report (which are the very maps Fairfax had to re-draw as part \nof his supplemental report).  Plaintiffs’ excuse for Spencer’s new performance analysis as \nhaving been necessitated by Fairfax’s error does nothing to cure or explain the fact that \nSpencer produce altogether new analyses.2  \nPlaintiffs’ supplementation of Plaintiff Holloway’s address—and Fairfax’s \nconfirmation that the new address remained in his illustrative district—is the very type of \nsupplementation that Rule 26(e) contemplates. In contrast, the wholly new maps and analyses \nproduced by Fairfax and Spencer, though perhaps necessitated by a simple error, plainly are \n \n2 In his original report, Spencer conducted a performance analysis for the one illustrative plan \nthat Fairfax provided in his original report. However, after Fairfax produced five (5) alternative \nillustrative maps in his rebuttal report, Spencer did not produce a corresponding performance \nanalysis for any of these five (5) new maps in his rebuttal report. See Exhibit 5 to Defendants’ \nMemorandum in Support at 16.  Plaintiffs erroneously claim that he did. Plaintiffs’ Brief at 10. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 7 of 15 PageID# 5891\nopinions and analyses of a scope and complexity far beyond that contemplated by Rule 26(e). \nTheir disclosures, six months after the close of expert discovery, constitute out-of-time expert \nopinions that are subject to Rule 37(c)(1)’s provision for the exclusion of such opinions from \nfurther use in litigation. \nII.  Defendants are significantly prejudiced by Plaintiffs’ out-of-time expert reports. \n \nPlaintiffs stridently and repeatedly assert that “Plaintiffs’ disclosures are harmless \nunder each of the relevant [Bresler] factors.” Plaintiffs’ Brief at 18.  However, the prejudice \nPlaintiffs’ out-of-time disclosures caused to Defendants’ is readily apparent.  The fact that \nPlaintiffs’ experts offered wholly new districts and performance analyses—supplanting the old \ndistricts and absence of performance analyses—on March 16, 2020, means that Defendants and \ntheir experts did not have access to the operative districts and performance analyses either \nduring the period open for expert discovery or prior to Defendants’ deadline to move for \nsummary judgment.  The notion that, in the context of a Section 2 vote dilution claim, not \npossessing the operative expert opinions on these matters is not prejudicial simply defies all \nreason. \nPlaintiffs have the temerity to claim that “Defendants are in no different a position now \nas they were before the supplemental reports.” Plaintiffs’ Brief at 15-16.  This, according to \nPlaintiffs, is because both their experts “used the same techniques and methodology in their \nsupplemental report as in their initial report.” Plaintiffs’ Brief at 15.  Plaintiffs here reassert the \nsame fallacy that blinds them to the fundamentally altered nature of their experts’ reports. The \nquality and reliability of an expert report are not measured solely by the type of technique or \nmethodology used in developing opinions or analyses.  It is the application of the \nmethodologies and techniques—and the unique resultant opinions—that matter.  That neither a \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 8 of 15 PageID# 5892\nsingle illustrative district map currently relied upon by Plaintiffs  nor one performance analysis \nfor the operative district maps was produced while expert discovery was open is plainly \nprejudicial to Defendants.  Defendants are unable to rewind time to incorporate these maps and \nanalyses in their summary judgment motion.  Defendants also have no current Court-\nsanctioned process for rebutting all of these new opinions.  And even were the Court to provide \na new opportunity for Defendants’ experts to rebut these new opinions, trial is now less than 60 \ndays away and there is an attendant cost and distraction incurred by forcing Defendants’ \nexperts to rebut these new maps and analyses.  For all these reasons, Defendants are not spared \nprejudice because they and they experts were allegedly aware of the general type of \nmethodology that Plaintiffs’ experts employ. \nDefendants were, unknowingly, flying blind during the open period for expert \ndisclosures and discovery and at the time they filed their summary judgment motion.  Plaintiffs \nattempt to minimize this prejudice by noting that “Defendants did not move for summary \njudgment on Gingles Prong 1” and by weighing in on what Defendants’ litigation strategy \nmight have been had they had possessed what Plaintiffs now offer as their operative expert \nopinions. Plaintiffs’ Brief at 17.  In so doing, Plaintiffs endeavor in vain to put back together \nHumpty Dumpty’s broken pieces.  They ignore obvious possibilities, such as the following: \nwhat if Defendants’ experts had been given the opportunity during the period of open expert \ndiscovery to examine the viability of an illustrative map that actually placed Plaintiff Allen’s \nresidence in a majority-minority district?  Obviously, any faults they found therein might well \nhave served as an alternative basis for a motion for summary judgment. Conveniently for \nPlaintiffs, that ship had long sailed by the time they made the disclosures at issue. \nThe incorporation of new ACS data in Fairfax’s new districts—far from saving \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 9 of 15 PageID# 5893\nPlaintiffs’ out-of-time disclosures—only emphasizes all the more that Humpty Dumpty cannot \nbe put back together again, even to serve Plaintiffs’ project of speculating what Defendants’ \nlitigation strategy might have been. This is so because the Defendants’ missed opportunity \nmust be viewed ex ante—namely, from the situation as it would have appeared at the time of \nthe filling of any dispositive motion.  As Plaintiffs’ make clear, the new ACS data was not \navailable during the period of open expert discovery or before dispositive motions were due.  \nHad Fairfax not made the crucial error in his initial and rebuttal reports of excluding Plaintiff \nAllen from an illustrative district, his illustrative maps (and Spencer’s performance analysis \nbased thereupon) would not have included the 2014-2018 ACS data.  Rather, any timely expert \nopinions would have been based on the ACS data from 2013-2017.  Those never-properly-\nperformed analyses then would have been the basis for the Court’s ruling on a putative \ndispositive motion.  And what would Fairfax’s illustrative districts based on that 2013-2017 \ndata have looked like?  Perhaps conveniently for Plaintiffs, we will never know.  Defendants \nwere entitled to receive the proper analysis on these crucial issues at the proper time.  Plaintiffs \nshould not gain strategic advantage from their experts’ own sloppy work.  The upshot is that, \nalthough it is true that the 2014-2018 ACS dataset only became available after expert discovery \nclosed, its inclusion in Plaintiffs’ supplementation only further muddies the waters with regard \nto Defendants’ missed opportunity at the summary judgment phase. Plaintiffs’ attempt to \n‘game-out’ Defendants’ strategy can provide no clarity to this matter. \nPlaintiffs also advertise their obliviousness to Defendants’ disadvantage by \nemphasizing that Spencer “logically” could only properly produce his new analysis once \nFairfax provided the operative districts.  This undoubtedly is true.  No less true, however, is \nthat Defendants and their experts could not properly evaluate Fairfax’s and Spencer’s work \nuntil they possessed the operative districts and performance analyses.  Plaintiffs take it as a \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 10 of 15 PageID# 5894\ngiven that, had Plaintiffs’ experts initially performed their analyses correctly—which would \nhave included the 2013-2017 ACS data—Defendants would have had no grounds to challenge \nthe resultant finding.  Again, we will never know. \nConsidering all this, Plaintiffs’ claim that Defendants “cured any possible prejudice” by \nre-deposing Plaintiffs’ experts rings hollow.  While Defendants’ diligent efforts perhaps \nmitigated some of the harm going forward, there is nothing they could do to recover lost \nopportunities to properly defend this case at earlier stages of litigation. \nAnother further manifestation of Plaintiffs’ blindness to the prejudice caused to \nDefendants is seen in their reliance upon this Court’s opinion in Barta v. Sears Roebuck & Co., \nwhich they cite for the proposition that the opportunity to depose the Plaintiffs’ experts \n‘eliminated any surprise, cured any defect, and substantially reduced or outright eliminated any \nprejudice to defendants.” 307 F. Supp. 2d 773, 783 (E.D. Va. 2004).  It is self-evident that this \nproposition cannot at all apply with respect to the summary judgment phase of this litigation—\nlong passed by the time Plaintiffs made the disclosures at issue.  Furthermore, in Barta, this \nCourt heard argument for both the motion to strike experts’ evidence and the parties’ cross-\nmotions for summary judgment at the same hearing and entered a joint order on these disparate \nissues. No. 3:03-cv-408, ECF Nos. 48 and 51.  Stated differently, in that case, the defendant \nhad received the supplemental reports being challenged before summary judgement was argued \nand decided. See 307 F. Supp. 2d 773. \nPlaintiffs’ supplemental disclosures related to Plaintiff Holloway’s change of address \ndid not meaningfully prejudice Defendants. In sharp contrast, those disclosures based on \nFairfax’s failure to include Plaintiff Allen’s residential address in an illustrative district caused \nDefendants irreparable harm. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 11 of 15 PageID# 5895\nIII.  Plaintiffs offer no justification for either Fairfax’s original error or the six-\nmonth delay in offering a correction. \n \nOnce again, Plaintiffs’ supplementation related to Plaintiff Holloway’s change of \naddress contrasts starkly with those supplementations flowing from Fairfax’s error regarding \nPlaintiff Allen’s long-standing residence address.  In the former instance, Plaintiffs’ later \ndisclosure was plainly justified because the information was new and didn’t require redrawing \nof any illustrative districts.  On the other hand, it is unclear how Plaintiffs’ assertion that \nFairfax’s failure to include Allen’s address in his illustrative districts was a “genuine accidental \nomission” justifies or cures the out-of-time disclosure. Plaintiffs’ Brief at 18.  Where a truly \nminor detail that does not change the operative analyses is at issue, perhaps this “honest-\nmistake” justification might suffice.  The United States District Court for the Middle District of \nNorth Carolina has admonished, however, that Rule 26(e) does not provide cover for “failures \nof omission because the expert did an inadequate or incomplete preparation.” Akeva L.L.C. v. \nMizuno, 212 F.R.D. 306, 310 (M.D.N.C. Dec. 20, 2012).  Fairfax’s inexcusable omission falls \nsquarely into this category. \nMoreover, while Defendants are inclined to believe that Fairfax’s error was an honest—\nthough gravely important—mistake, that fact does nothing to explain why Plaintiffs did not \nsupplement his report until six months after the deposition that Plaintiffs’ claim alerted Fairfax \nto his error.  Plaintiffs’ Brief at 2.  Plaintiffs provide no reason for this delayed \nsupplementation.  Were it the case that they found the 2013-2017 five-year ACS data \nunfavorable to their purposes, it may have been an advantage to wait for the newer ACS data to \nseek a tactical benefit from his error.  Importantly, Plaintiffs have failed to (ever) provide a \ncorrection to Fairfax’s illustrative maps based on the 2013-2017 ACS data that was in effect \nduring the expert discovery period.  Stated plainly, Plaintiffs should not be permitted to use \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 12 of 15 PageID# 5896\nFairfax’s failure to include Plaintiff Allen in his illustrative districts to introduce a slow \nmoving Trojan horse that contains freshly drawn districts based upon newly released ACS \ndata—long after expert discovery and the summary judgment phase of trial had concluded.   \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ argument regarding waiver attempts to cast fault on Defendants for \nPlaintiffs’ failures and omissions. \n \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants waived any objection to their out-of-time disclosures \nby working diligently to re-depose Plaintiffs’ experts.  The policy ramifications of this putative \nstandard are astonishing.  Were the standard Plaintiffs propose adopted, any party that believes \nit is prejudiced by an out-of-time disclosure would have an enormous incentive to sit on their \nhands and do nothing because efforts to mitigate the resultant prejudice would constitute a \nwaiver of their objections.  Sound trial practice dictates the opposite result: that a party \nimpacted by an untimely disclosure should first work to mitigate any prejudicial impact and \nthen seek Court relief to the extent necessary.  Notably, Plaintiffs have doubled-down on their \nmitigation-as-waiver argument by repeatedly refusing to depose any of the additional fact \nwitnesses formally identified in Defendants’ Third Supplement to their Initial Disclosures.  \nSimply put, a rule that benefits those who refuse to mitigate prejudicial impacts while \npunishing those who diligently work to mitigate prejudice emphatically fails to serve public \npolicy or promote sound trial practice.  \nPlaintiffs additionally argue that Defendants have waived objection by waiting until \nJuly 2020 to file their motion. Oddly, Plaintiffs would have the Court start the “clock” on \nOctober 24, 2019—the date they alerted Defendants that a supplemental report would \neventually be provided at an unspecified date. Plaintiffs’ Brief at 11-12.  In Plaintiffs’ view, the \nfive additional months of delay in producing supplementation (that already would have been \nlate in October 2019) somehow works against the Defendants—rather than against the \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 167   Filed 08/11/20   Page 13 of 15 PageID# 5897\nPlaintiffs.  Plaintiffs advance this argument despite the fact that Defendants did not then have \nthe supplemental reports until March 2020 and could not possibly have known the actual \ncontents of those reports until they were received.  Plaintiffs’ contention defies all notions of \ndecency and fair-play.  Defendants have not waived their objections either by making diligent \nefforts to mitigate harm via re-deposing Plaintiffs’ experts or by Plaintiffs’ long delay in \nproducing the supplemental reports they promised in October 2019.  \nCONCLUSION  \n \nA careful review of the Plaintiffs’ Brief reveals that they cannot substantively deny that \ntheir so-called “supplemental” expert reports are: (1) substantial changes to their earlier \nopinions, (2) out-of-time, (3) prejudicial to the Defendants, and (4) without material \njustification.  Defendants renew their request that the Court exclude the new analyses and \nopinions contained in these reports—namely, all newly proposed district maps found in \nFairfax’s supplemental report and all performance analyses of these newly offered maps found \nin Spencer’s supplemental report—from use at trial or for any other evidentiary purpose and to \ngrant such further relief as the Court deems proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA \nBEACH CITY COUNCIL, and LOUIS \nJONES, JAMES WOOD, JESSICA ABBOTT, \nROBERT DYER, BARBARA HENLEY, \nMICHAEL BERLUCCHI, JOHN MOSS, GUY \nTOWER, AARON ROUSE, ROSEMARY \nWILSON, SABRINA WOOTEN, TOM \nLEAHY, and DONNA PATTERSON, all in \ntheir official capacities \n     \n             By: /s/ Joseph M.

Civil Action No. 2:18-CV-69 \nCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF  \nMOTION TO DISMISS \n \n  NOW COMES the City of Virginia Beach, by counsel, and for its Memorandum of Law \nin Support of Motion to Dismiss, respectfully sets forth the following: \nFactual and Procedural Background \n  Latasha Holloway (“Holloway”), pro se, filed a Motion for Leave to file in forma \npauperis along with a Complaint against the City of Virginia Beach (the “City”) alleging \nviolations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. 1983, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984, and the First, \nFourteenth, and Fifteen Amendments to the United States Constitution on November 20, 2017, in \nthe Alexandria Division of this Honorable Court.  ECF No. 1.  The Alexandria Division of this \nCourt, sua sponte, ordered this matter transferred to the Norfolk Division pursuant 28 U.S.C. \n1391(b)(2) and Local Civil Rule 3(c) for further consideration.  ECF No. 3.  Thereafter, this \nCourt granted Holloway’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and filed Holloway’s Complaint \nwith an instruction to the Clerk of Court to prepare a waiver of service to the City.  ECF No. 4.  \nPrior to any responsive pleadings by the Defendant, the Court considered Holloway’s motion to \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 14   Filed 04/10/18   Page 2 of 9 PageID# 49\nappoint counsel, a motion for an interlocutory appeal as to the motion to appoint counsel, and a \nmotion to stay the proceedings pending the interlocutory appeal.  See ECF Nos. 6, 10.  The Court \ndenied without prejudice the Motion for Appointment of Counsel, denied the Motion for an \nInterlocutory Appeal, and deferred the Motion to Stay pending this responsive pleading by the \nCity.  ECF No. 11.  \nThe City, having waived service of process, now moves to dismiss the Complaint, \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on the grounds that Holloway \nfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \n Holloway’s Complaint discloses neither her race, nor age, nor whether she suffers from a \ndisability.  Holloway avers only that she is a resident of the City of Virginia Beach and that she \nis a registered voter in the City.  ECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 3.  The Complaint sets forth six \nseparate counts.  Holloway’s primary contention is that the current “at-large” voting method \nemployed by the City violates the specific requirements of the Voting Rights Act by diluting the \nvotes of African-American citizens.1  Holloway also claims that elderly and disabled persons are \ndeprived of “accessible or alternate polling places in elections.”  ECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 10.  \nEach count of her Complaint consists of a single, conclusory statement beneath the heading, and \neach is devoid of any supporting facts.  \nHolloway seeks several forms of declaratory and injunctive relief ostensibly intended to \ncure the supposed violations that she alleges in the six separate counts of her Complaint.  ECF \nNo. 5, Complaint ¶ 11.  Holloway does not offer any proposal for a ward or single member \ndistrict system that would satisfy the requirements of the Voting Rights Act as part of her \n                                                           \n1 It should be noted that in 1998 this Court addressed the merits of a vote-dilution claim against \nthe City of Virginia Beach as it relates to the use of an at-large voting system. See generally  \nLincoln v. City of Virginia Beach, No. 2:97cv756 (E.D.V.A. Dec. 29, 1997) (opinion attached \nhereto as Exhibit “A”). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 14   Filed 04/10/18   Page 3 of 9 PageID# 50\ndemand for injunctive relief.  Nor does Holloway explain in what regard the City deprives \nelderly or disabled citizens access to polling places.  Instead, Holloway merely demands that the \ncurrent at-large voting system be replaced with a system of wards or single-member districts and \nthat the City be ordered to comply with “Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \nand the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984 (VAEHA) and laws.” \nECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 11(B)(2-4).  \nStandard of Review \nAccording to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), “[a] pleading that states a claim for \nrelief must contain . . . a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2).  Rule 8(a)(2) requires the complaint “to ‘give the \ndefendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’”  The \nSupreme Court of the United States has defined this pleading standard, holding that the \ncomplaint must contain “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim that is \nplausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  Moreover, the Court held that “[a] claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id. \nThe Supreme Court also has held that a complaint must allege more than a “sheer \npossibility that the defendant has acted unlawfully,” to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Id.  Although a sufficiently pleaded complaint \ndoes not “require ‘detailed factual allegations,’” it does require facts which are more than \n“‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability” in order to cross “the line between possibility \nand plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).  The basis \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 14   Filed 04/10/18   Page 4 of 9 PageID# 51\nfor the plaintiff’s entitlement to relief “requires more than labels and conclusions, and a \nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  \nAlthough courts are required to “take all the factual allegations in [a] complaint as true, [they] \nare not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Papasan v. \nAllain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).   \nAlthough a pro se complaint is “h[e]ld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings \ndrafted by lawyers,” Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972), the Supreme Court “ha[s] \nnever suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to \nexcuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.”  McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, \n113 (1993).  “Thus, while the Court must extend leeway to the pro se Plaintiff, such leeway must \nbe tempered to require the Plaintiff to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nspecifically . . . Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  Davis v. Bacigalupi, 711 F. \nSupp. 2d 609, 615 (E.D. Va. 2010).   \nArgument \nI.  Holloway’s Complaint Fails to State a Single Claim Against the City of Virginia \nBeach That Is Plausible on Its Face. \n \n“The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to test the sufficiency of a complaint . . . .”  \nEdwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999). Because Holloway’s \nComplaint is devoid of factual support for her allegations, the Complaint lacks facial plausibility \nand fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  As drafted, the Court cannot draw \nany “reasonable inference that [the City] is liable for the misconduct alleged” because \nHolloway’s Complaint is comprised of nothing more than six conclusory statements labeled as \ncauses of action.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); ECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 1-6.  The \n“labels and conclusions” or “formulaic recitation[s] of the elements of a cause of action” \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 14   Filed 04/10/18   Page 5 of 9 PageID# 52\nHolloway offers in the Complaint are wholly insufficient to successfully plead a claim. See \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  Further, although the Court must take all the factual \nallegations in the Complaint as true, the Court is free to ignore “a legal conclusion couched as a \nfactual allegation.”  Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).   \nThe City does not contend that Holloway must set forth detailed factual allegations; \nhowever, Holloway must set forth some facts to show the cause of action is plausible on its face. \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).  Holloway sets forth \nonly that she has been “a registered voter at all times . . . [and is] a resident of the City of \nVirginia Beach and of the Commonwealth of Virginia and a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica.”  ECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 3.  Holloway does not allege her race, age, disability, or \nother status that would confer legal standing to Holloway or otherwise place her in a protected \nclass pertinent to showing the plausibility of her claims or justifying the injunctive relief \ndemanded.  See ECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 11.  \nThe First Cause of Action reads in its entirety: “Plaintiff claims injury as direct result of \nthe defendants at large elections to the City Council deprives [sic] the plaintiff and other \nqualified voters of equal treatment and an opportunity to vote for a candidate of their choice as \nguaranteed by the Voting Rights Act, 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §1973, et seq., 42 U.S.C. \n§1983, and the First, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nwhile acting under color of state law.” The second, third, fourth and fifth causes of action also do \nno more than recite similar conclusory statements of law; none of them provide factual support \nfor Holloway’s claim of vote dilution. Aside from a brief footnote requesting judicial notice be \ntaken of the number of African-Americans that have been elected to the Virginia Beach City \nCouncil, Holloway’s Complaint offers no factual support for her claims.  This footnote is wholly \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 14   Filed 04/10/18   Page 6 of 9 PageID# 53\ninadequate to establish a vote dilution claim. Although the extent of minority electoral success is \none factor appropriate for consideration in such cases, “nothing in [Section 2] establishes a right \nto have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the \npopulation.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b) (formerly codified at 42 USCS § 1973). \nThe United States Supreme Court has opined that the \"essence of a Section 2 claim is that \na certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to \ncause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred \nrepresentatives.\" Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 47, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 2764 (1986); see also \nJohnson v. DeGrandy, 512 U.S. 997, 114 S. Ct. 2647 (1994).  The Court has characterized the \nevaluation of a vote-dilution claim as “a flexible, fact-intensive test.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46, \n106 S. Ct. at 2764.  Moreover, a trial court’s “determination is peculiarly dependent upon the \nfacts of each case and requires an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the \ncontested electoral mechanisms.” Id. at 79, 106 S. Ct. at 2781 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  Holloway fails to offer any facts which would allow this Court to undertake \nthe required fact intensive analysis and these claims of vote dilution must therefore be \ndismissed.2  \nSeveral of Holloway’s vote-dilution allegations also appear to be unnecessarily \nduplicative. The second and fourth causes of action, as well as the fifth and third causes of \naction, allege identical legal conclusions.  The only differences between the second and fourth \ncauses of action are the addition of the words “ethnic” and “linguistic,” as well as making the \n                                                           \n2 The City also notes that Holloway has not offered any facts establishing the existence of any of \nthe “necessary preconditions” for a plaintiff to state a plausible case of vote dilution in multi-\nmember districts as set forth in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 48-52, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 2765-\n68 (1986) (holding that certain circumstances are necessary preconditions for multi-member \ndistricts to operate to impair minority voters' ability to elect representatives of their choice.). \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 14   Filed 04/10/18   Page 7 of 9 PageID# 54\nword “minority” plural.  See ECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 6, 8.  Other than those differences, the two \ncauses of action track each other identically.  Similarly, the only differences between the third \nand fifth causes of action are the addition of the words “ethnic” and “linguistic,” and otherwise \nthe two causes of action are identical.  See ECF No. 5, Complaint ¶ 7, 9. \nHolloway’s Sixth Cause of Action reads in its entirety: “The City of Virginia Beach \ndeprives elderly people and people with disabilities basic accessible or alternate polling places in \nelections in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended 42 U.S.C. §1973, 42 U.S.C. \n§1983, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Voting Accessibility for the \nElderly and Handicapped Act of 1984 (VAEHA), and the First, Fourteenth and Fifteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution while acting under color of state law.”  See ECF \nNo. 5, Complaint ¶ 7. \nHolloway fails, as a primary matter, to state her age or whether she suffers from any \ndisability that falls within the ambit of any of the statutes she cites.  Nor does Holloway provide \neven a scintilla of evidence to support the bare legal conclusion contained therein. Holloway’s \nrequest for relief highlights the insufficiency of her claim, asking the Court to order Defendants \nto fully comply with the ADA, the VAEHA, “and laws”—but nowhere explaining in what regard \nthe City failed to comply these acts. Holloway’s Sixth Cause of Action therefore must be \ndismissed.  \nConclusion \nHolloway’s Complaint leaves the Court and the City to guess as to what facts exist, if \nany, that support her claims and justify her demands for declaratory and injunctive relief. \nHolloway’s Complaint is impermissibly formulaic and devoid of factual assertions that support \nher alleged causes of action.  A close review of Holloway’s Complaint, even providing the \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 14   Filed 04/10/18   Page 8 of 9 PageID# 55\nappropriate deference to a pro se litigant, reveals that the allegations do not combine to state any \nclaims that are plausible on their face and, therefore, fail to meet the basic requirements of Rule \n8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nFor the reasons fully set forth herein, the City of Virginia Beach requests the Court \ndismiss the Complaint with prejudice and afford the City all other such relief it deems \nappropriate.  \nRespectfully Submitted,  \n \nCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH \n \n            By:     /s/     \nOf Counsel \n \n \nMark D.

Civil Action No. 2:18-CV-69 \n   \nCity of Virginia Beach, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nDEFENDANT’S REPLY TO PLAINTIFF’S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO   \nTHE DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \n \nCOMES NOW Defendant City of Virginia Beach, by counsel, and for its Reply to the \nPlaintiff’s Objection and Memorandum of Law in Support in Opposition to the Defendant’s \nMotion to Dismiss and accompanying Affidavit, states as follows: \nA careful review of Plaintiff’s Reply Objection and Memorandum of Law in Support in \nOpposition to the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (“Response Brief”) and the accompanying \nAffidavit (“Affidavit”) reveal the lack of substance to this lawsuit.  See generally ECF No. 26, \n27.  In its Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Defendant observes that \nPlaintiff’s Complaint fails to “provide even a scintilla of evidence to support the bare legal \nconclusions contained therein.”  ECF No. 14 at 5.  Plaintiff does not substantively rebut \nDefendant’s characterization of her Complaint.  Instead, the Response Brief and Affidavit recite \nthe Complaint’s same legal conclusions alongside a smattering of “new” factual material—\nmostly related to historical events that precede the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and \npredate the 2010 census that informed current voting districts in the City of Virginia Beach.  The \naddition of this new material does not advance her original claims made in the Complaint. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 30   Filed 06/19/18   Page 2 of 4 PageID# 158\nFor example, with regard to the claims based upon Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, \nPlaintiff asks the Court to take judicial notice that “Plaintiff has shown that a minority \nrepresentation district can be drawn in a manner that complies with the overriding demands of \nthe Equal Protection Clause,” lending support to this assertion by claiming that the African-\nAmerican voting age population in seven neighborhoods within the City of Virginia Beach “is \nsufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a 50% majority . . .”  ECF No. 26 at \n7.  Plaintiff provides no demographic information regarding the racial makeup of these \nneighborhoods; nor does Plaintiff provide any information regarding the shape, size, or total \npopulation of a hypothetical election district that would include these neighborhoods.1  Plaintiff’s \nstatements in the Response Brief as to her vote dilution claims appear to be no more than pure \nspeculation or guesswork.   \nFurther, with an understanding the Court will likely consider all of Plaintiff’s filings \ngiven her pro se status, Plaintiff’s Affidavit is a string of repetitive, unsupported assertions that \nlack the necessary factual enhancement. See generally ECF No. 27.  While the Court must accept \nall of Plaintiff’s allegations as true, this Court is not bound to accept as true “a legal conclusion \ncouched as a factual allegation.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). \nEven with full consideration given to her status as a pro se litigant, Plaintiff’s Affidavit is an \nextension of the unsupported conclusions from the Complaint and fails to meet federal pleading \nstandards.  \nWith regard to Plaintiff’s claim regarding voting accessibility, Plaintiff fails to address \n                                                           \n1 In fact, the map Plaintiff incorporates in her Response Brief portrays the named neighborhoods \nas being noncontiguous and strewn across a large geographic expanse encompassing heavily \npopulated areas of the City of Virginia Beach. Thus, not only does Plaintiff fail to plausibly \nallege the existence of a possible district of sufficient minority concentration and geographic \ncompactness, the facts she provides actually suggest the improbability of that condition. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 30   Filed 06/19/18   Page 3 of 4 PageID# 159\nthe fact that nowhere does her Complaint allege that she belongs to the class of disabled or \nelderly citizens that would have standing to bring this claim. See generally, ECF 26. The only \nadditional “information” added to the bare legal conclusion of her Complaint is that seven named \nvoting precincts “lack adequate handicapped parking . . .” ECF 26 at 11. Plaintiff leaves it to the \nCourt’s imagination to guess how many handicapped parking spots are at each precinct and why \nthat unsaid number is “inadequate.” Plaintiff’s vague and insubstantial allegation does not \nconstitute a claim for relief plausible on its face. \nConclusion \n \nRelying on the arguments set forth herein and the arguments previously advanced in its \nMemorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Defendant City of Virginia Beach \nrespectfully asks this Court to grant its motion and to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety with \nprejudice. \n      CITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH \n \n \n      By:_________/s/________________ \n        Of Counsel \n \nMark D.

The City of Virginia Beach has conducted at-large\ndiscriminatory elections for city council since July\n1. 1972 until present, contrary to the evolving ruling\nof the U.S. Supreme Court in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478,\nU.S. 30, 106 S. Ct. 2752, 92 L. Ed 25 (1986)\n2. From 1906 until 1986 every member of Virginia\nBeach's City Council to hold office was white. In\n1986 John Richard Logan Perry, was the first African\nAmerican elected to Council until 1990, Louisa M.\nStrayhorn was the first African American female from\n1994-1998, and Dr. Amelia Ross-Hammond was the second\nAfrican American female from 2013 until 2016, and from\nthat time, until this motion was filed, the council had\nno African American member.\n3. The City's at-large voting scheme is undertaken\nwithout consent, is conducted in a manner likely to\nfoster white majority racial bloc voting in elections\nthat results in the denial or dilution of African\nAmericans voting strength, which violates Section 2\nof the Voting Rights Acts of 1965, and the rights of\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 3 of 11 PageID# 186\nplaintiff and those similarly situated secured by the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n4. The City's at-large elections voting scheme\nconstitutes an illegal vote dilution device that\nminimizes Plaintiff's voting strength that is subject\nto Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, thus there is a\ncognizable Section 2 claim. A preliminary injunction is\ntherefore, attainable.\n5. The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled illegal at-\nlarge elections dilute minority voting strength and the\ncity's reluctance to abandoned it violates Section 2 of\nthe Voting Rights Act. See Collins v. City of Norfolk\nVirginia, 883 F.2d 1232, 1235 {4th Cir. 1989).\n6. In particular, \"a substantial likelihood\" exist that\nPlaintiff will prevail on the merits. There is no\nremedy at law for these violations.\n7. If the Court denies enjoining defendants, it would\nseverely impact the Plaintiff's constitutional and\nstatutory rights and cause immediate irreparable harm.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 4 of 11 PageID# 187\n8. Plaintiff's Federal constitutional and statutory\nrights against illegal at-large elections, vote\ndilution device and deprivation of their equal\nprotection can only be protected against immediate\nand certain violations in this case by issuance of\nthe requested preliminary injunction.\n9. In order to prevail on their motion for preliminary\ninjunction, petitioners must show as here the court\nthat (1) there is a substantial likelihood that\nplaintiff will prevail on the merits; (2) there is a\nsubstantial threat that plaintiff the United States\nand the Commonwealth of Virginia will be irreparably\ninjured by defendants' action if temporary injunctive\nrelief is not granted; (3)the relief requested will\nnot cause irreparable injury to respondents conducting\noutlawed at-large city council elections of its members\nor other interested persons without a modification of\nlaw or new legal standard; and (4) the relief requested\nwill serve, and will not adversely affect the public\ninterest. Wetzel v. Edwards, 321 U.S. 414, 441, 64\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 5 of 11 PageID# 188\nS.ct. 660, 88 L. Ed. 834 (1943); 7 J. Moore and J.\nKennedy, MooreFederal Practice ^ 65.04 [1] (2d ed.\n1982). All of these criteria are met in this case.\n10. To obtain the relief requested, petitioners need\nnot show that they are absolutely entitled as a matter\nof law to the final relief requested on the merits.\n11. Under the above-described standards, plaintiff need\nonly show that they have a substantial likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, and in some situations need not\neven go that far. In Blackwelder Furniture Co. v.\nSeilig Manufacturing Co. 550 F. 2d 189 (4*^'' Cir. 1977) ,\nthe Fourth Circuit emphasized that if a \"grave\"\nquestion was presented, or if \"serious\" issues are\nraised, that requirement diminishes in importance. At\np. 195 the court stated:\nThe district court below erred in holding that\nplaintiff must first show \"likelihood of success\" in\norder to be entitled to preliminary relief. Instead,\nthe first step in a Rule 65(a) situation is for the\ncourt to balance the \"likelihood\" of irreparable harm\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 6 of 11 PageID# 189\nto the plaintiff against the \"likelihood\" of harm to\nthe defendant; and if a decided imbalance of hardship\nshould appear in plaintiff's favor, then the\n^^likelihood\"-of-success test is displaced by Judge\nJerome Frank's famous formulation: [I]t will ordinarily\nbe enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going\nto the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and\ndoubtful, as to make them fair ground for litigation\nand thus for more deliberate investigation. F. 2d 762,\n770 (5th Cir. 1988); Gavilik v. Continental Can Co.,\n812 F. 2d 834, 851 (3rd Cir.), cert. Denied, 484 U.S.\n979 (1987); Titch v. Reliance Group Inc., 548 F. Supp.\n983, 985 (S.D.N.Y 1982), aff'd mem. , 742 F. 2d 1441 (2d\nCir. 1983). See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558\n(1974)), Conduct intended to injure in some way\nunjustifiable by any government interest.\" Lewis\n118 S. Ct. at 1716, 1717. See Albright v. Oliver, 510\nU.S. 266 (1994) .\n1. TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE: The City of Virginia Beach, Virginia,\nwill hold general elections for city council and a special\nelection for the office of mayor on November 6, 2018.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 7 of 11 PageID# 190\nLEGAL DISCUSSION\n12. A preliminary injunction is appropriate if the\nmoving party demonstrate either (1) a possibility of\nirreparable injury, or (2) serious questions going to\nthe merits and the balance of hardship tipping sharply\nin his favor. Chalk v. United States Dist. Ct., 840\nF.2d 701,704 (9th Cir. 1988). Moore's Federal Practice,\n^ 65.04 [1], p. 65-36 {2d Ed. 1982); Blackwelder\nFurniture Co. v Seiliq Manufacturing Co., 550 F. 2d 189\n(4th Cir. 1977); Wetzel v. Edwards, supra.\n13. As stated above, the plaintiff need not show an\nabsolute entitlement to final relief, but that a\ngenuine issue exists.\nThe above discussion indicates that there is such an\nissue.\n14. The second requirement is that plaintiff must\nshow a substantial threat of irreparable injury.\n15. The holding of the city council's discriminatory\nat-large elections and of mayor scheme, will further\nminimizes and dilute plaintiff's voting rights, if\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 8 of 11 PageID# 191\nallowed to go forward as scheduled on November 6,\n2018, plaintiff would suffer the most serious and\nimmediate irreparable injury by reason of a violation\nof their federal constitutional and statutory rights\nagainst, discriminatory at large elections and would\nbe subjected to and could constitute a deliberate in\ndifference to their rights. See Slack, 529 U.S. at\n484-85.\n16. The current at-large elections vote dilution\ndevice, and defendants wild-bald assertion the Court\nupheld it, a couple of decades ago, is just a back door\nscheme to continue unlawful at-large election practices\nto vote dilution. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478, U.S. 30,\n106 S. Ct. 2752, 92 L. Ed 25 (1986).\n17. This Court has jurisdiction over a suit to enjoin\nofficials from enforcing a state law on the ground that\nfederal law preempts state law. Ainmex, Inc. v. Cox, 351\nF. 3d 697 (6^ Cir. 2003).\n2.TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE: Plaintiff asserts that her minority group is politically\ncohesive and has been consistently denied the election of its preferred candidates by\nthe white majority's use of bloc voting techniques, and that African-American voters\nare \"sufficiently geographically compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably\ndrawn balancing voting district.\" See. e.g. McDaniels v. Mehfoud, 702 F. Supp. 588,\n592 (E.D. Va. 1989). Virginia Const. Art. VII, § 5.\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 9 of 11 PageID# 192\n18. The Court referred to ''the Supreme Court's repeated\nholdings that federal jurisdiction extends to suits to\nenjoin state enforcement on federal preemption and\ncomparable grounds.\"\n19. Defendants conduct is illegal or unconstitutional,\nand invalid under state and federal law.\n20. The Defendants actions under color of law boarders\non the criminal, if not criminal for intentional\nviolations of the Constitution, Civil Rights and Voting\nRights Act. Id.\nCONCLUSION\n21. \"Classifications and distinctions based on race or\ncolor have no moral or legal validity in our society.\nThey are contrary to our constitution and laws.\"\n— Thurgood Marshall\n22. The thrust of this case is that Virginia Beach's\nat-large city council elections were adopted in 1906,\nand have been maintained for the purpose of maintaining\npolitical white supremacy and have had the result of\nminimizing and diluting African Americans voting\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 35   Filed 06/29/18   Page 10 of 11 PageID# 193\nstrength in violation of the rights of plaintiff and\nthose similarly situated secured by the Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended\nin 1982, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n16. TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE: It should be noted in 1967, the Court did not address invidious\ndiscrimination in voting, it was held the City's plan made no distinction based on racc, creed,\nor economic status or location and the charter was local, and not one for a three-judge court;\nand this Court in 1967, did address vote dilution and dismissed Lincoln for failure to prosecute.\nMoody V.

Hansen, in his official capacity as City Manager, \nand Donna Patterson, in her official capacity as Director of Elections/General Registrar for the \nCity of Virginia Beach, as follows:  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 2 of 18 PageID# 316\nI. INTRODUCTION \n1.  This action challenges the at-large election system used to elect members of the \nCity Council of Virginia Beach (“City Council”) and seeks to replace it with a system in which \nBlack, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American voters are together able to elect their preferred \ncandidates of choice to the City Council. The current at-large scheme impermissibly denies \nBlack, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian-American voters (“Minority Voters”) an equal opportunity \nto participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice, in violation of \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301 (“Section 2”). Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 \nU.S. 30 (1986).   \n2.  The City Council is the governing authority in Virginia Beach. The City Council \nmakes decisions that profoundly affect the health, well-being, and livelihood of Virginia Beach \nresidents. \n3.  The City of Virginia Beach is the largest city in Virginia. The City has used an at-\nlarge voting system to elect members to the City Council since 1966.  \n4.  The demographics of Virginia Beach have changed tremendously since 1966. The \npercentage of minorities in the City has more than doubled since the 1970 census, yet only six \nminority candidates have ever been elected to the City Council and no Black candidate has ever \nbeen re-elected to serve a second term.  \n5.  According to the 2010 Census, minorities constitute 31.6% of the total population \nin Virginia Beach and Non-Hispanic Blacks constitute 19.0% of the total population. According \nto the 2012-2016 American Community Survey, the Non-Hispanic White citizen voting age \npopulation (“CVAP”) was 69.3%, the Non-Hispanic Black CVAP was 18.3%, the Non-Hispanic \nAsian CVAP was 5.2%, and the Hispanic CVAP was 4.8%. \n  2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 3 of 18 PageID# 317\n6.  Yet, Minority Voters in Virginia Beach have been prevented from participating \nfully in City Council elections because of the way that councilmembers are elected. That election \nmethod, in which all councilmembers are elected at-large in citywide elections, unlawfully \ndilutes the voting strength of Minority Voters and prevents them from electing their candidates \nof choice to the City Council.  \n7.  The City Council has eleven members. Because voting is racially polarized—\nwhite voters as a group and Minority Voters as a group usually prefer different candidates—the \nat-large method of election has regularly functioned to deprive almost one-third of the city’s \nvoting age population from electing candidates of their choice to any of the eleven seats on the \nCity Council. \n8.  The consistent defeat of minority preferred candidates would not occur if the City \nCouncil were elected using ten single-member voting districts and one at-large mayoral race. The \nminority citizen voting age population is sufficiently large and geographically compact to \nconstitute a majority in at least two single-member districts that would be likely able to elect \ntheir candidates of choice to the City Council; the City’s Minority Voters are politically \ncohesive; and the City’s white citizen voting age majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it \nusually to defeat Minority Voters’ preferred candidates. Because of these circumstances, as well \nas the historical, socioeconomic, and electoral conditions in Virginia Beach, the at-large election \nmethod for the City Council violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301 \n(“Section 2”). Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986). \n9.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for this Court to issue: (1) a \ndeclaratory judgment that the at-large election system for electing members to the City Council \nviolates their civil rights by unlawfully diluting the voting strength of Minority Voters; (2) an \n  3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 4 of 18 PageID# 318\ninjunction against the further use of at-large elections for the City Council; (3) an order requiring \nfuture elections for the City Council to be conducted under a method that complies with the \nConstitution and the Voting Rights Act; (4) an award to Plaintiffs of costs, reasonable attorneys’ \nfees, and litigation expenses incurred in bringing this action; and (5) further relief as the Court \ndeems just and equitable. \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to (1) 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a), \nbecause this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, privileges, \nand immunities secured by the Voting Rights Act; and (2) 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because this action \narises under the laws of the United States. \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant both declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n12.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants. \n13.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District.  \nIII. PARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff LATASHA HOLLOWAY is a Black registered voter, and a resident of \nVirginia Beach, Virginia.  \n15.  Plaintiff GEORGIA ALLEN is a Black registered voter, and a resident of Virginia \nBeach, Virginia. In 2008, Plaintiff Allen was an unsuccessful candidate for an at-large seat on \nthe City Council, despite being the candidate of choice of Minority Voters. \n16.

She is sued in her official capacity only.  \nIV. FACTS AND BACKGROUND \nA.  The City Council of Virginia Beach \n21.  The eleven-member City Council is the governing body for the City of Virginia \nBeach. The Mayor and the other ten councilmembers are elected at-large to four-year staggered \nterms. Seven of the eleven councilmembers are required to be residents of the seven districts in \nVirginia Beach (Bayside, Beach, Centerville, Kempsville, Lynnhaven, Princess Anne, and Rose \nHall) but are nonetheless elected at-large. The other four seats, including the Mayor, are elected \nat-large with no residency requirements.  \n  5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 6 of 18 PageID# 320\n22.  Upon information and belief, elections in Virginia Beach are nonpartisan but \ncandidates often have party affiliations. \n23.  Virginia Beach operates under a council-manager system of government in which \nthe City Council appoints the City Manager, who is the executive and administrative head of the \nCity, and serves at the pleasure of the Council. The City Manager has the power and the duty to \nappoint all officers and employees of the City, delegate power to such appointees, and remove \nhis subordinates.  \n24.  The most recent election for seats on the City Council took place on Nov 6, 2018. \nThe next scheduled City Council election will be on November 3, 2020. \nB.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n25.  Section 2, 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a), prohibits any “standard, practice, or procedure” \nthat “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on \naccount of race or color[.]” A violation of Section 2 is established if it is shown that “the political \nprocesses leading to [a] nomination or election” in the jurisdiction “are not equally open to \nparticipation by [minority voters] in that its members have less opportunity than other members \nof the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their \nchoice.” Id. § 10301(b).  \n26.  Section 2 prohibits the use of an electoral scheme that dilutes the voting strength \nof minority voters and thereby deprives them of an equal opportunity to elect representatives of \ntheir choice.  \n27.  In Virginia Beach, the at-large method of election for the City Council submerges \nMinority Voters so that they are rendered ineffective electoral minorities in most elections. \n  6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 7 of 18 PageID# 321\n28.  The at-large method of election for the City Council violates Section 2 because it \ndenies Virginia Beach’s Minority Voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political \nprocess and elect councilmembers of their choice. \n29.  It also violates Section 2 because it dilutes the vote of all Virginia Beach Minority \nVoters. \nC.  Virginia Beach Demographics   \n30.  Virginia Beach is located in southeastern Virginia. It is the largest city in Virginia \nwith 450,435 residents. \n31.  Virginia Beach’s Black population has grown over the past five decades, from \n9.1% in 1970 to 20.2% in 2017. Over the same period, the non-Hispanic white population \ndeclined from 90.0% in 1970 to 61.7% in 2017. \n32.  The Latino and Asian populations have similarly increased over the past several \ndecades in Virginia Beach. The 1970 Census indicates that all races besides white and Black \nmade up 0.9% of the population. Now, Latinos make up 8.2% of the population in Virginia \nBeach and Asians make up 7.2% of the population. \n33.  There is a significant minority population in the northwest part of Virginia Beach. \n34.  According to the 2010 Census, the Non-Hispanic White voting age population \n(“VAP”) was 67.4%, the Non-Hispanic Black VAP was 18.1%, the Non-Hispanic Asian VAP \nwas 6.3%, and the Hispanic VAP was 5.6% \n35.  According to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey, the Non-Hispanic \nWhite citizen voting age population (“CVAP”) was 69.3%, the Non-Hispanic Black CVAP was \n18.3%, the Non-Hispanic Asian CVAP was 5.2%, and the Hispanic CVAP was 4.8%. \n  7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 8 of 18 PageID# 322\n36.  The population and the racial demographics for Virginia Beach, which are the \nbasis for Plaintiffs’ demonstrative redistricting plan, are summarized in the following table: \nTable 1 – Virginia Beach Population by Race \nCitizen Voting Age \nTotal Population  Voting Age \nPopulation (2012-\nDemographic  (2010)  Population (2010) \n2016) \n(number)  (%)  (number)  (%)  (number)  (%) \nNH White  282,470   64.5%  224,188   67.4%  220,002   69.3% \nNH Black  83,210   19.0%  60,212   18.1%  58,169   18.3% \nNH Asian  26,312   6.0%  20,978   6.3%  16,648   5.2% \nHispanic or \nLatino  28,987   6.6%  18,765   5.6%  15,197   4.8% \n \nD.  Virginia Beach City Council Election History  \n37.  Minority candidates for the Virginia Beach City Council have had little electoral \nsuccess. \n38.  Upon information and belief, in the entire history of Virginia Beach, only five \nBlack City Council candidates (Aaron Rouse, Sabrina Wooten, Dr. Amelia Ross-Hammond, \nLouisa M. Strayhorn, and John L. Perry), one Asian-American candidate (Ron A. Villanueva), \nand no Latino candidates have been elected to the City Council.  \n39.  Prescott Sherrod, an African-America businessman in Virginia Beach, was \nappointed to the City Council in 2011 and was not re-elected to this seat six months later, despite \nbeing the minority candidate of choice.  \n40.  Upon information and belief, over that same time period, 72 white \ncouncilmembers were elected or appointed to the City Council.  \n  8 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 9 of 18 PageID# 323\n41.  John L. Perry, Louisa M. Strayhorn, Prescott Sherrod, and Dr. Amelia Ross-\nHammond were not re-elected and each served only one term. \n42.  Aaron Rouse and Sabrina Wooten were elected to the City Council on November \n6, 2018 and have not yet stood for re-election. \n43.  In 1986, John L. Perry was elected as the representative of the Bayside District, \nbecoming the first Black candidate to hold a seat on the City Council.  \n44.  Louisa M. Strayhorn was elected in 1994, becoming only the second Black \ncandidate to hold a City Council seat in Virginia Beach. \n45.   In 1998, when Louisa M. Strayhorn ran for reelection, upon information and \nbelief, she faced death threats and other forms of intimidation.   \n46.  A newspaper article quoted Louisa M. Strayhorn on the troubling memories of her \nfailed attempt at re-election and the racist backlash from Virginia Beach residents: “I had phone \ncalls saying, ‘We’re going to make sure that nigger doesn’t get elected.’ After the election, \npeople would drive by and say, ‘See, nigger, we said we’d get you.’”1 \n47.  In 2016, Dr. Amelia Ross-Hammond lost reelection to Jessica Abbot, a 27-year-\nold white candidate. White bloc voting contributed to Abbot’s victory.  \nE.  The At-Large Scheme Prevents Minority Voters from Electing Their Candidates of \nChoice Under Thornburg v. Gingles. \n \n48.  In Gingles, the United States Supreme Court identified three necessary \npreconditions (“the Gingles preconditions”) for a claim of vote dilution under Section 2: \n(1) The minority group must be “sufficiently large and geographically compact to \nconstitute a majority in a single-member district”; \n                                                 \n1 Bruce Murphy, Even in the Most Integrated City, Race Is Still a Thorny Issue, MILWAUKEE J. SENTINEL (Jan. 14. \n2003), http://mumford.albany.edu/census/2003newspdf/jsonlineSeries/011403MURPHYjsonline.pdf. \n  9 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 10 of 18 PageID# 324\n(2) The minority group must be “politically cohesive”; and \n(3) The majority must vote “sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the \nminority’s preferred candidate.” 478 U.S. at 50, 51 (citation omitted). \nEach of these preconditions exist here.  \n49.  Virginia Beach’s minority population is sufficiently numerous and geographically \ncompact to form a majority of the total population and citizen voting age population in at least \ntwo single-member City Council districts in a demonstrative 10-district plan See Exhibit A. \n50.  Plaintiffs Allen and Holloway live within the boundaries of a potential majority-\nminority district. See Exhibit A (Plaintiffs’ residences are marked by stars indicating their \nlocation within the bounds of the demonstrative map). \n51.  A statistical analysis demonstrates that voting patterns in the City Council \nelections are racially polarized, with Minority Voters consistently voting for a particular (often \nBlack) candidate of choice. White bloc voting in support of their preferred candidates has \nrepeatedly led to the defeat of candidates preferred by Minority Voters. \n52.  Virginia Beach’s Minority Voters are politically cohesive.  \n53.  Hispanic and Asian voting patterns track Black voting patterns. Hispanic-white \nvote polarization tends to be greater than Black-white vote polarization. Asian-white voter \npolarization is statistically indistinguishable from Black-white vote polarization.  \n54.  Together, Minority Voters vote overwhelmingly for different candidates than \nthose supported by white voters. This is true even when two Black candidates run against each \nother and one is not the Black voters’ candidate of choice. This is also true when there is no \nwhite bloc voting, see discussion of Chuck Smith infra ¶ 58. \n  10 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 11 of 18 PageID# 325\n55.  Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters vote together as a coalition, and not just for \nminority candidates in general. \n56.  Whatever costs are borne by Black voters in the current at-large election system is \nshared by Hispanic and Asian voters: minority candidates that are strongly preferred by Black, \nHispanic, and Asian voters are systematically losing elections. \n57.  Virginia Beach’s white electorate votes as a bloc in support of different \ncandidates than those supported by Minority Voters. Bloc voting by white members of the \nelectorate routinely defeats candidates preferred by Minority Voters. \n58.  In the past five elections (2010-2018), 22% (16 out of 74) of all City Council \ncandidates were Black, yet only three out of twenty-two winning candidates (14%) were Black:2 \nDr. Amelia Ross-Hammond, Aaron Rouse, and Sabrina Wooten. Dr. Ross-Hammond only \nserved a single four-year term before being defeated in 2016 by a white 27-year-old candidate \nwho was not the Minority candidate of choice. Mr. Rouse and Ms. Wooten were only elected in \n2018 and therefore have not stood for re-election. \n59.  Every Black candidate who has run for the City Council since 2010, with the \nexception of one Black Republican candidate, faced racially polarized voting and was usually \ndefeated by the white voting bloc.  \n60.  The one Black candidate who did not face racially polarized voting, Chuck Smith, \nran for a City Council seat in 2012.  He was the sole opponent of Dr. Amelia Ross-Hammond, \nwho won the seat and became only the third Black candidate and the fourth minority ever to be \nelected to the City Council. Chuck Smith was not the candidate of choice of Minority Voters. \n                                                 \n2 Two races (for the Bayside and Beach Districts) in the November 6, 2018 election are too close to call as of the \nfiling of this complaint, but the two possible winners in each case are white candidates and so have been included in \nthis total. \n  11 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 12 of 18 PageID# 326\n61.  Racial polarization very likely impacted the outcome of a 2010 City Council race \nbetween Tanya Bullock (candidate of choice for Minority Voters) and the white incumbent City \nCouncil member Barbara Henley. Because Bullock had so little cross-over support from white \nvoters, she was defeated.  \n62.  There is also evidence of racial polarization in elections with multiple candidates. \n63.   For example, in the 2008 at-large election between Harry Diezel, white \nincumbent, Andrew Jackson, a Black challenger, and Jose Flores, a Black Hispanic challenger, \nfor the Kempsville seat, Black voters did not support the incumbent, but split their votes between \nJackson and Flores. Asian and Hispanic voters voted similarly. \n64.  Racially polarized voting was apparent in the 2010 election for two of the four at-\nlarge City Council seats without residency requirements. Seven candidates ran for this at-large \nseat. The top two candidates won the election. The two candidates that received the highest \nnumber of votes were white, while the two candidates receiving the lowest number of votes were \nBlack. Andrew Jackson, one of the losing Black candidates, was strongly opposed by white \nvoters even though he was the clear candidate of choice for Minority Voters. James Cabiness \nwas the other Black candidate in this race. Although he was not the candidate of choice for \nMinority Voters, he received more support from Minority Voters than other candidates did. \n65.  James Cabiness ran for election again in 2014, but instead of running for the at-\nlarge position with no residency requirement, he ran for the Rose Hall District. Cabiness ran \nagainst Shannon Kane, a white candidate, and another Black candidate. Minority Voters strongly \nsupported the Black candidate (James Cabiness) and opposed the white candidate (Shannon \nKane) who ultimately won. Minority Voters’ support for the other candidates in the race was low \nand not statistically and significantly different from white support.  \n  12 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 13 of 18 PageID# 327\n66.  Upon information and belief, City Council elections predating 2008 exhibited \nsimilar patterns of racially polarized voting between white voters and Minority Voters. \n67.  Exogenous elections also exhibit racial polarization.  \n68.  For example, Black voters in Virginia Beach strongly preferred Barack Obama to \nboth John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. White voters strongly preferred McCain \nand Romney.  \n69.  In the 2016 Congressional election in Virginia Beach, Black voters strongly \npreferred Shaun Brown, a Black woman, over Scott Taylor, a white man. White voters strongly \nsupported Taylor over Brown. Taylor won with 62.3% of the overall vote.  \n70.  Upon information and belief, Minority Voters as a whole voted similarly to Black \nvoters in these exogenous elections. \nF.  The Totality of the Circumstances Further Demonstrates the Dilutive Effect of the \nAt-Large System on Virginia Beach Minority Voters’ Opportunity to Participate in \nthe Political Process and Elect Candidates of Their Choice. \n \n71.   In addition to the presence of the three Gingles preconditions, the totality of the \ncircumstances in this case supports Plaintiffs’ claim that Minority Voters have less opportunity \nthan other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and elect candidates of \nchoice to the City Council in violation of Section 2.  \n72.  The electoral districting scheme for the City Council interacts with social and \nhistorical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunity of Minority Voters to elect \nrepresentatives of their choice as compared to white voters.  \n73.  The State of Virginia and the City of Virginia Beach have a long and well-\ndocumented history of discrimination against Blacks, Latinos, and Asians. \n  13 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 14 of 18 PageID# 328\n74.   Despite the 1870 ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited voter \ndiscrimination based on race, Virginia continued to employ literacy tests, poll taxes, and other \ndiscriminatory devices to obstruct Black political participation. While progress has been made, \nthis obstruction has persisted for more than a century, with many cities and counties embracing \nelectoral schemes that have been challenged by Virginia citizens and the United States \nDepartment of Justice for unlawful discrimination. \n75.  In recent years, the Virginia General Assembly discriminated against Black voters \nthrough the passage of an unconstitutional racially gerrymandered redistricting scheme. Bethune-\nHill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 2018 WL 3133819 (June 26, 2018), cert. granted, \nNo.18-281 (2018).  \n76.  Minorities in Virginia Beach bear the effects of longstanding societal, economic, \nand educational discrimination, effects that are apparent in the areas of education, employment, \nhousing, and health. Such discriminatory effects hinder Minority Voters’ ability to participate \neffectively in the political process. \n77.  The denial of the right of Virginia Beach minority residents to have an equal \nopportunity to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice to the City \nCouncil has resulted in a City Council that is not responsive to the particular needs of the \nminority residents. \n78.  The City Council is responsible for making decisions about a variety of issues that \nsignificantly impact Virginia Beach residents, including public spending, quality of life, \nhealthcare, education, and safety.  \n  14 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 15 of 18 PageID# 329\n79.  For the past several decades, Black residents of Virginia Beach have, without \nsuccess, petitioned the City Council to consider changing the at-large system for electing \ncouncilmembers to a district-based system. \n80.  Elections for the City Council have been marked by racial appeals.  \n81.  Latinos in Virginia and Virginia Beach have been notoriously discriminated \nagainst when renting apartments. \n82.  As a result of the history of official and private discrimination, minority residents \nof Virginia Beach have lower rates of educational attainment than white residents and experience \npoverty and unemployment at higher rates than white residents. These effects of discrimination \nhinder the ability of Virginia Beach minority residents to participate effectively in the political \nprocess. \nCOUNT ONE: \nVIOLATION OF SECTION 2 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 \n83.   Plaintiffs’ repeat and re-allege each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs \n1 to 80 above, as if fully set forth herein. \n84.  Virginia Beach’s Black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian population is sufficiently \nnumerous and geographically compact to allow for the creation of two single-member districts in \nwhich Minority Voters would constitute a majority of both the total population and the citizen \nvoting age-population. Virginia Beach, Minority Voters are politically cohesive, and elections in \nVirginia Beach show a clear pattern of racially polarized voting.  \n85.  The totality of the circumstances establish that the at-large election scheme \ncurrently in place has the effect of denying Minority Voters an equal opportunity to participate in \n  15 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 16 of 18 PageID# 330\nthe political process and to elect representatives of their choice by diluting their voting strength, \nin violation of Section 2. \n86.  Unless enjoined by order of this Court, Defendants will continue to act in \nviolation of Section 2 by administering, implementing, and conducting future elections for the \nCity Council using the current, unlawful at-large scheme.  \nDEMAND FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter an order: \n(a) Declaring that Virginia Beach’s at-large method of electing members to the City Council \nviolates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; \n(b) Enjoining Defendants, their agents and successors in office, and all persons acting in \nconcert with, or as an agent of, any Defendants in this action from administering, \nimplementing, or conducting any future elections in the City of Virginia Beach under the \ncurrent at-large method of election; \n(c) Ordering the implementation of an election system for the City Council that complies \nwith Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; \n(d) Ordering that all future elections for the City of Virginia Beach comply with Section 2 of \nthe Voting Rights Act; \n(e) Granting Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, costs, and litigation expenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1988(b) and 52 U.S.C. § 10310(e); and \n(f) Granting any other relief that the Court may deem just and equitable. \nThis 13th day of November, 2018. \nRespectfully submitted, \nAttorneys for Plaintiffs \n  16 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 62   Filed 11/13/18   Page 17 of 18 PageID# 331\n \n/s/ Charquia V.

(ECF No. 5.)  In response, on April 10, \n2018, the City filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (ECF No. 13.) \nAfter having attained the representation of the Campaign Legal Center, and joined by co-\nPlaintiff Georgia Allen, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on November 13, 2018—one week \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 2 of 31 PageID# 772\n \n \nafter the most recent councilmanic elections.  The Amended Complaint altered the theory of \nPlaintiffs’ claim, now basing the Section 2 vote dilution claim on an alleged tri-partite coalition of \nBlack, Asian, and Hispanic voters.  All discovery deadlines have passed, and, per the Court’s \nOctober 22, 2019 deadline for filing dispositive motions, Defendants move for summary judgment. \nSTATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS \n1)  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint asserts a vote dilution claim under Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, seeking to replace the present seven residence district, all at-large voting \nsystem of electing council members “with a system in which Black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian \nAmerican voters are together able to elect their preferred candidates of choice to the City Council.”  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 1.) \n2)  Georgia Allen and Latasha Holloway, the two Plaintiffs in the present action, are African-\nAmerican residents of Virginia Beach. There are no Plaintiffs of Asian or Hispanic descent or from \nthe Asian or Hispanic communities. (See generally Am. Compl.) \n3)  Plaintiffs’ retained expert, Anthony Fairfax, is offered to opine upon the plausibility of \ncreating at least one district in Virginia Beach with a Black-Asian-Hispanic tripartite majority-\nminority population.  This inquiry is commonly referred to as Gingles Prong 1. (Ex. 3 at 80). \n4)  Fairfax has not been retained to offer opinions on Gingles Prong 2 or 3. (Ex. 3 at 80). \n5)  Fairfax produced an Initial Report and a Rebuttal Report.  Fairfax’s Initial Report is \nattached as Exhibit 1 and his Rebuttal Report is attached as Exhibit 2. \n6)  In Fairfax’s Initial Report, he proposed a ten-district map of Virginia Beach that purported \nto contain two tri-partite (Black-Asian-Hispanic) majority-minority districts. (Ex. 1 at 20). \n7)  Fairfax contends that these two proposed majority-minority districts would have combined \nBlack-Asian-Hispanic  citizen  voting  age  populations  (CVAP)  of  50.03%  and  50.04%, \nrespectively.  (Ex. 1 at 19-20). \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 3 of 31 PageID# 773\n \n \n8)  Fairfax amplified his opinions regarding Gingles Prong 1 in deposition testimony given on \nSeptember 24, 2019.  Fairfax’s deposition transcript is attached as Exhibit 3.  \n9)  Fairfax testified that 69 of 100 total precincts in Virginia Beach have less than 40% \ncombined HBA CVAP; that 21 of 100 total precincts have between 40% and 50% percent \ncombined HBA CVAP; and that only 10 of 100 total precincts (10% of the total) have a combined \nHBA CVAP greater than 50% percent combined HBA CVAP.  (Ex. 3 at 167-168, Ex. l at 13).   \n10)  Fairfax testified he did not calculate a margin of error for the 50.03% and 50.04% combined \nHBA CVAP estimates for his proposed majority-minority districts.  (Ex. 3 at 191). \n11)  Plaintiffs’ vote dilution claim asserts that a tri-partite coalition of Black, Hispanic, and \nAsian minority voters in Virginia Beach is politically cohesive.  Plaintiffs specifically allege: \n“Hispanic and Asian voting patterns track Black voting patterns” and “Black, Hispanic, and Asian \nvoters vote together as a coalition, and not just for minority candidates in general.”  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 1, 48, 53, 55). \n12)  Plaintiffs’ vote dilution claim asserts that the white majority in Virginia Beach votes \nsufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the tri-partite minority’s preferred candidate.  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 8, 48, 51, 57).   \n13)  Plaintiffs’  retained  expert,  Dr.  Douglas  Spencer,  is  offered  to  opine  whether  Black, \nHispanic, and Asian voters in Virginia Beach vote cohesively and whether the white majority in \nVirginia Beach votes sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the preferred candidates of the alleged \ntripartite minority coalition-group—these two inquiries being commonly referred to as Gingles \nProng 2 and Prong 3, respectively.  (Ex. 4 at 3.) \n14)  Spencer produced two reports (“Initial Report” and “Rebuttal Report”) containing his \nopinions with regard to Gingles Prongs 2 and 3.  Spencer’s Initial Report is attached as Exhibit 4 \nand his Rebuttal Report is attached as Exhibit 5. \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 4 of 31 PageID# 774\n \n \n15)  Spencer amplified his written opinions in deposition testimony given on October 1, 2019.  \nSpencer’s deposition transcript is attached as Exhibit 6.  \n16)  Spencer’s Initial Report contains the only Gingles Prongs 2 and 3 statistical point-estimates \nfor voting support levels and cohesiveness among minority groups and of voting support levels of \nwhites for candidates running for City Council in Virginia Beach provided by Plaintiffs to \nDefendants on or before Plaintiffs’ expert report disclosure deadline. (See generally Ex. 4; see also \nEx. 3 at 80-81, Ex. 8 at 118-120). \n17)  In his deposition, Spencer defined cohesion among different racial minority groups as \n“each group has the most preferred candidate, and the most preferred candidate of each three \ngroups is the same.”  (Ex. 6 at 109). \n18)  For each election analyzed in Spencer’s Initial Report, Spencer provided voting support \npoint estimates only for white voters (alone), black voters (alone), and “All Minority” voters—the \nlatter category combining Black, Hispanic, Asian, and all other non-white voters. (Ex. 4 at 8-10, \nEx. 5 at 6, Ex. 6 at 106). \n19)  In his Initial Report, Spencer offered no voting support point estimates for Hispanic voters \n(alone) or Asian voters (alone).  (Ex. 4; Ex. 6 at 68-71). \n20)  Spencer wrote and testified that he did not produce voting support point estimates for \nHispanic voters (alone) or Asian voters (alone) because he believed those populations were too \nsmall and insufficiently concentrated in precincts in Virginia Beach to produce reliable estimates.  \n(Ex. 4 at 6; Ex. 5 at 8 (Table 1), Ex. 6 at 68-71). \n21)  In his Initial Report, Spencer stated: “I define elections as probative of racially polarized \nvoting when they feature a minority candidate running for the office under investigation; in this \ncase the City Council.”  (Ex. 4 at 11; See also Ex. 6 at 71-72) (emphasis added). \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 5 of 31 PageID# 775\n \n \n22)  In  his  Initial  Report,  Spencer  identified  17  City  Council  races  featuring  a  minority \ncandidate running for the office under investigation from 2008-20181 and in his charts referred to \nthese 17 races collectively as “All Probative Races.” (Ex. 4 at 14, 16, 19, 21, 23, 27, and 29; Ex. 6 \nat 71-72). \n23)  Spencer chose to exclude 3 of the 17 City Council races (4 seats total) involving George \nFurman, a minority candidate, from his analysis – Mayor (2016), At-Large (2014), and Bayside \n(2010).  (Ex. 4 at 3, 14, 16, 19, 27, 39 and Appendix B; Ex. 6 at 85). \n24)  In the races that Spencer chose to exclude, three candidates who Spencer identified as being \na “minority candidate of choice” prevailed – Sessoms (2016), Davenport (2014), and Jones (2010).  \n(Ex. 4, at 14, 16, 19, and 27; Ex. 6 at 84-89). \n25)  Spencer’s Rebuttal Report contains the only additional Gingles Prongs 2 and 3 voting \npattern data and analysis that was provided to Defendants on or before Plaintiffs’ rebuttal report \ndisclosure deadline.  (Ex. 5). \n26)  In his Rebuttal Report, Spencer presented a new Racially Polarized Voting Analysis (Table \n1) considering 13 specific candidates – 10 minority and 3 white.  (Ex. 5 at 8). \n27)  Spencer’s new analysis, contained in Table 1 of his Rebuttal Report, excludes three \nprevailing candidates who Spencer initially identified as being minority candidates of choice in \nthe Furman elections: Sessoms (2016), Davenport (2014), and Jones (2010). (Ex. 5 at 8 (Table 1)). \n28)  In his Rebuttal Report, Spencer presented, for the first time, voting support point estimates \nfor Hispanic voters (alone) and for Asian voters (alone), but only as to a single candidate—Aaron \nRouse (2018).  (Ex. 5 at 7-8). \n \n1 The 2018, 2014, and 2010 At-Large races had two seats available in each cycle and are thus \nconsidered as 6 of the 17 races analyzed. \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 6 of 31 PageID# 776\n \n \n29)  Upon the Defendants’ request (following receipt of Spencer’s Rebuttal Report), Spencer \nprovided point estimates for Hispanic voters (alone) and Asian voters (alone) for the 13 candidates \nhe analyzed in Table 1 of his Rebuttal Report – but not for any other candidates in those or any \nother elections.  Spencer’s point estimates for Black, Hispanic, and Asian support (and the \ncorresponding standards of error) were provided as a data set (“Data Set”) to Defendants on \nSeptember 5, 2019.  The Data Set is attached hereto as Exhibit 7.  \n30)  Spencer wrote that “[t]o draw my conclusions…” regarding cohesion as contained in Table \n1, “…I adopt the logic of equivalence testing.”  (Ex. 5 at 7). \n31)   Spencer confided during his deposition testimony, however, that “I don’t think Table 1 is \nvery meaningful, which is why I did not generate it for my original report.  I don’t think the \nestimates that are used in this table actually mean much.  I am not confident in their findings at \nall.” (Ex. 6 at 125). \n32)  Spencer further admitted in deposition that the confidence intervals (similar to standards \nof error) for his point estimates of Hispanic and Asian voter support are “so ridiculous, ridiculously \nbig.” (Ex. 6 at 44, 146).  \n33)  In Spencer’s Data Set, only 6 of the 13 candidates analyzed received 50% or more support \nfrom both Black voters and Hispanics voters: Wooten (2018), Ross-Hammond (2012), Bullock \n(2010), Allen (2008), White (2018) and Henley (2014).  Only 3 of those 13 candidates—Wooten \n(2018), Bullock (2010) and Henley (2014)—received 50% or greater support from Black, Hispanic \nand Asian voters.  (Ex. 7). \n34)  Spencer further conceded in deposition that using his equivalence testing method, he could \nonly conclude that 7 of the 13 candidates were minority preferred.  Of those 7 candidates, 4 won \nelection.  (Ex. 5 at 8 (Table 1), Ex. 6 at 152). \n6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 7 of 31 PageID# 777\n \n \n35)  Plaintiffs’ retained expert, Dr. Allan Lichtman, is offered to provide testimony regarding \nracial polarization and the “totality-of-the-circumstances” analysis under Gingles.  Lichtman did \nnot generate his own voter support or cohesiveness data or analysis under the Gingles factors, and \nto the extent he has any opinions on Gingles Factor 2 or Factor 3, he relies exclusively upon the \ndata and opinions generated by Spencer.  (Ex. 8 at 220-221).  \n36)  Lichtman amplified his written opinions in deposition testimony given on September 30, \n2019.  Lichtman’s deposition transcript is attached hereto as Exhibit 8. \n37)  Lichtman conceded in deposition testimony that he had reviewed Virginia Beach data and \nconcluded that it is not possible to develop statistically reliable voter support point estimates for \neither Asian voters (alone) or Hispanic voters (alone) in Virginia Beach and equivalence testing is \nneeded to compare voting behavior across these three minority groups. (Ex. 8 at 58-62, 220-222). \n38)  Lichtman conceded there were no “extreme case” or “homogenous precincts” for Asians \nor Hispanics in Virginia Beach.  (Ex. at 59-60; see also Ex. 6 at 71). \n39)  Lichtman testified that because the error margins are going to be wide for isolated estimates \nof Asians and Hispanics, “you've got to use the equivalence testing analysis” to compare candidate \npreferences among Asian, Hispanic, and Black voters in Virginia Beach.  (Ex. 8 at 220-221.) \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nSummary judgment is appropriate only when the Court, viewing the record as a whole and \nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, determines that there exists \"no genuine issue \nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Seabulk Offshore, \nLtd. V. Am. Home Assur. Co., 377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir. 2004).  The moving party has the initial \nburden to show the absence of an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case and to \ndemonstrate that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Honor v. Booz-Allen \n7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 8 of 31 PageID# 778\n \n \n& Hamilton, Inc., 383 F.3d 180, 185 (4th Cir. 2004); McLean v. Patten Cmtys., Inc., 332 F.3d 714, \n718 (4th Cir. 2003). \nWhen the moving party has met its burden to show that the evidence is insufficient to \nsupport the nonmoving party’s case, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to present \nspecific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. \nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Honor, 383 F.3d at 185; McLean, 332 F.3d at \n718-19.  Such facts must be presented in the form of exhibits and sworn affidavits.  Celotex, 477 \nU.S. at 324.  Failure by a plaintiff to rebut a defendant’s motion with such evidence on his behalf \nwill result in summary judgment when appropriate.  “[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates \nthe entry of summary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to \nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will \nbear the burden of proof at trial.”  Id. at 322. \nAlthough a court must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, in \norder to successfully defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must rely on \nmore  than  conclusory  allegations,  “mere  speculation,”  the  “building  of  one  inference  upon \nanother,” the “mere existence of a scintilla of evidence,” or the appearance of “some metaphysical \ndoubt\" concerning a material fact.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986); \nThompson v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 312 F.3d 645, 649 (4th Cir. 2002). Rather, the evidence \nmust be such that the fact-finder reasonably could find for the nonmoving party. See Anderson, \n477 U.S. at 252. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nIn Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court of the United States set forth the elements that \nplaintiffs must prove in order to succeed on vote dilution claim under Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act.  478 U.S. 30 (1986).  Vote dilution claims consist of two phases, (1) a set of three \n8 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 9 of 31 PageID# 779\n \n \npreconditions that must be established before (2) a “totality of the circumstances” analysis is \nundertaken.    United  States  v.  Charleston  County,  365  F.3d  341,  348  (2004).  The  Gingles \npreconditions are as follows: (1) the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) the minority group is politically \ncohesive; and (3) the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the \nminority’s preferred candidate.  478 U.S. 30, 51 (1986).  These threshold inquiries are focused \nmostly on data regarding voting patterns and demographic information.  Only when a plaintiff \nmeets their burden of satisfying all three Gingles preconditions do courts need evaluate whether, \nunder the “totality of the circumstances,” the minority vote is diluted in contravention of Section \n2.  Levy v. Lexington County, 589 F. 3d 708, 713 (4th Cir. 2009).  If a plaintiff cannot satisfy all \nthree Gingles preconditions, the vote dilution claim is defeated.  See id.; Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d \n421 (2004) (dismissing plaintiffs’ vote dilution suit for failure to state a claim where the three \nGingles preconditions could not be satisfied.). \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit describes the “totality of the \ncircumstances” inquiry “s \"a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality which \ndemands a comprehensive, not limited, canvassing of relevant facts.”  Charleston County, 365 at \n348 (quotations omitted). \nARGUMENT \n  The  Defendants  contend  that  Plaintiffs  cannot  meet  any  of  the  myriad  burdens  to \nsuccessfully prove a vote dilution claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act—not only in \nregard to the three Gingles preconditions, but also regarding the “totality-of-the-circumstances” \ninquiry.  The Defendants’ summary judgment motion, however, focuses solely on the second and \nthird Gingles prongs—the respective requirements that Plaintiffs demonstrate that the minority \n9 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 10 of 31 PageID# 780\n \n \ngroup in question is politically cohesive and that the white majority in Virginia Beach votes \nsufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the preferred candidates of the minority group in question. \n  It is appropriate to note at the outset what is not before this Court with respect to the \nundisputed facts Defendants intend to marshal in support of the arguments for summary judgment: \nthose facts do not evince a so-called “battle-of-the-experts.”  Rather, Defendants present herein an \n“exposure-of-the-expert”—a repudiation of Plaintiffs’ expert’s core conclusions regarding Prongs \n2 and 3 that is performed, ironically, by the Plaintiffs’ expert himself. \n  The reports and testimony of Dr. Douglas Spencer, Plaintiffs’ retained expert regarding \nProngs 2 and 3, are the foundation of the arguments Defendants advance herein.  Spencer’s own \nwords and data show unmistakably that the evidence adduced by his own methodology and \nanalysis is hopelessly inadequate to satisfy Plaintiffs’ Prong 2 cohesion burden, and further, tends \nto disprove the existence of the Prong 3 precondition.  In the wake of Spencer’s analysis and \ntestimony, any possibility that Plaintiffs can prevail in this case is reduced to zero. \nI.  Gingles Prong 2: Coalition claims are not cognizable under Section 2, or, at \nthe very least, create a burden regarding cohesion among the Minority \nGroup that Plaintiffs’ own data reveals they cannot satisfy.  \n \nPlaintiffs’ theory of this case relies upon the alleged cohesion of Black, Asian, and \nHispanic voters in Virginia Beach.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 8, 48, 53, 55).  It remains an open question \nin  the  Fourth  Circuit  whether  such  a  coalition  claim  is  even  cognizable  under  Section  2.  \nDefendants first ask this Court to hold that a tri-partite minority coalition claim is impermissible \nas  a  matter  of  law  and  grant  Defendants’  summary  judgment  on  this  independent  basis.  \nAlternatively,  assuming  arguendo  that  tri-partite  minority  coalition  claims  are  cognizable, \nDefendants ask this Court to grant summary judgment because Plaintiffs’ evidence fails to \nestablish cohesion of Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters in Virginia Beach, as required by Gingles. \n10 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 11 of 31 PageID# 781\n \n \na.  Plaintiffs’ tri-partite minority coalition claim should not be permitted under \nthe plain language of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  \n \nThe Supreme Court has not resolved whether two or more allegedly cohesive minority \ngroups can satisfy the Gingles preconditions.  In Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1020 \n(1994), and Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41 (1993), the Court assumed, without deciding, that \nminority coalition groups may be used to establish a claim under the Voting Rights Act, while in \nBartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 13–14 (2009), it declined to address the issue.  Meanwhile, lower \ncourts are split, with some circuits resolving the issue either in favor of a minority plaintiff or \nresolving the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Representation v. City of \nBridgeport, 26 F.3d 271, 276 (2d Cir. 1994), vacated, 512 U.S. 1283 (1994); LULAC v. Clements, \n999 F.2d 831, 864 (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc); Concerned Citizens v. Hardee Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, \n906 F.2d 524, 525 (11th Cir. 1990). \nOn the other hand, in Nixon v. Kent County, the court held that coalition claims were not \ncognizable under Section 2, as a matter of law. 76 F.3d 1381, 1393 (6th Cir. 1996). The Sixth \nCircuit explained that the plain language of the statute “does not mention minority coalitions, either \nexpressly or conceptually,” that Section 2 “consistently speaks of a ‘class’ in the singular,” and \nthat  if  Congress  “had  intended  to  sanction  coalition  suits,”  the  statute  would  have  read \n“participation by members of the classes of citizens protected by subsection (a).”  Id. at 1386.  The \ncourt in Nixon also outlined four policy considerations to support the conclusion that minority \ncoalitions were not cognizable under Section 2.  Id. at 1390-93.   Defendants urge this Court to \nadopt the Nixon holding. \nIn Hall v. Virginia, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit also cast \nserious doubt on whether multiracial coalition claims are cognizable under Section 2.  385 F.3d \n421 (4th Cir. 2004).  The Hall opinion addressed whether “crossover” districts—wherein Blacks \n11 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 12 of 31 PageID# 782\n \n \ndid not form a majority but attained the ability to elect their preferred candidates with the help of \na segment of white voters—could be used to satisfy the compactness and numerosity requirement \nof Gingles’ first prong. Id. at 425.  The Fourth Circuit ultimately held that such crossover districts \ncould not satisfy Prong 1, stating that “any construction of Section 2 that authorizes the vote \ndilution claims of multiracial coalitions would transform the Voting Rights Act from a law that \nremoves disadvantages based on race, into one that creates advantages for political coalitions that \nare not so defined.”  Id. at 431 (emphasis added).  The Hall court further explained its reasoning \nas follows: \nwhen minority voters, as a group, are too small or loosely distributed to form a \nmajority in a single-member district, they have no ability to elect candidates of their \nown choice,  but  must  instead  rely  on  the  support  of  other  groups  to  elect \ncandidates. Under these circumstances, minorities cannot claim that their voting \nstrength—that  is,  the  potential  to  independently  decide  the  outcome  of  an \nelection—has  been  diluted  in  violation  of Section  2. \n \nId. at 429 (emphasis original). Although at issue in Hall was a Black minority being \ncomplemented by a segment of white voters—and not by other minority groups—the court’s \nlanguage was not limited to black-white coalitions.  Further, the Hall opinion supported its \ndecision with the following language from the dissent from the first Fifth Circuit case to recognize \nmultiracial coalitions: “If a minority group lacks a common race or ethnicity, cohesion must rely \nprincipally on shared values, socio-economic factors, and coalition formation, making the group \nalmost indistinguishable from political minorities as opposed to racial minorities.”  Id. at 431 \n(quoting Campos v. City of Baytown, 849 F.2d 943, 945 (5th Cir. 1988) (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting from denial of reh'g en banc)).  Although the Fourth Circuit did not definitively decide \nthe issue, the dicta in Hall strongly suggests that Section 2 multiracial coalitions are not permitted.2 \n \n2 See also Hall v. Virginia, 276 F. Supp. 2d 528, 536 (E.D.Va 2003) (“The question [] is whether \nthe disfavor that has befallen vote dilution claims in influence districts likewise precludes such \nclaims with respect to coalition districts. The Court FINDS that it does.”) \n12 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 13 of 31 PageID# 783\n \n \nHere, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs’ vote dilution claim is predicated upon the alleged \npolitical cohesiveness of a tri-partite racial coalition of Black, Hispanic, and Asian minority voters \nin Virginia Beach.  Plaintiffs specifically allege, “Hispanic and Asian voting patterns track Black \nvoting patterns” and “Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters vote together as a coalition, and not just \nfor minority candidates in general.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 53, 55).  Plaintiffs make no allegations as to \nany single minority group alone being sufficient to state a claim under Section 2, and there is no \nevidence in the record that Blacks alone, Hispanics alone, or Asians alone could plausibly state a \nclaim for a Section 2 violation.  Therefore, Plaintiffs rest their entire case on the hope that this \nCourt does not adopt the logic of the Sixth Circuit, and that it disregards the strong indications \nprovided by this Court and the Fourth Circuit in Hall v. Virginia that coalition claims are not \ncognizable.  Defendants ask this Court to join the Sixth Circuit in holding that coalition claims are \nnot cognizable under Section 2 and, as a result, Defendants’ summary judgment motion is granted.  \nb.  Assuming the Plaintiffs’ tripartite coalition theory is cognizable under Section \n2, Plaintiffs’ own evidence fails to establish that the combined group of \nBlacks, Hispanics, and Asians are a politically cohesive in Virginia Beach. \n \nThe Supreme Court of the United States has set forth the cohesion requirement for vote \ndilution claims in unambiguous terms, stating in Gingles that “the minority group must be able to \nshow that it is politically cohesive.  If the minority group is not politically cohesive, it cannot be \nsaid that the selection of a multimember electoral structure thwarts distinctive minority group \ninterests.” 478 U.S. 30, 51 (1986).  In Shaw v. Reno, the Court emphasized that it had “unanimously \nreaffirmed that racial bloc voting and minority-group political cohesion never can be assumed, but \nspecifically must be proved in each case in order to establish that a redistricting plan dilutes \nminority voting strength in violation of § 2.” 509 U.S. 630, 653 (1993) (emphasis added) (citing \nGrowe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40-41 (1993)). \n13 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 14 of 31 PageID# 784\n \n \nThe most common method of proving such cohesion is “[a] showing that a significant \nnumber of minority group members usually vote for the same candidates” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56.  \nA “boilerplate” vote dilution claim, as contemplated by Gingles, focuses upon only one ethnic or \nlanguage minority group.  See, e.g., 478 U.S. 30. In that context, this Court has adopted 60% voting \nsupport for a given candidate as the appropriate marker of cohesion within a single group. Smith \nv. Board of Supervisors, 801 F. Supp. 1513, n. 11 (E.D.Va. 1992) (“This Court finds persuasive \nDr. Lichtman's use of a 60 percent figure for a cohesion rate.”). \nThe Supreme Court has never recognized the validity of Section 2 vote dilution claims \nbased upon the alleged cohesiveness of multiple language or ethnic groups. In Growe v. Emison, \nthe Court did, however, address how the cohesion requirement would operate if multiracial \ncoalition Section 2 claims were permitted. 507 U.S. 25 (1993). The Court held as follows:  \nAssuming (without deciding) that it was permissible for the District Court to \ncombine distinct ethnic and minority groups for purposes of assessing compliance \nwith § 2, when dilution of the power of such an agglomerated political bloc is the \nbasis for an alleged violation, proof of minority political cohesion is all the more \nessential. Since a court may not presume bloc voting within even a single minority \ngroup, it made no sense for the District Court to (in effect) indulge that presumption \nas to bloc voting within an agglomeration of distinct minority groups. \n \nId. at 41 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \nFollowing the Supreme Court’s lead, those circuit courts that have allowed multiracial \ncoalition claims to move forward have emphasized the high burden required to prove cohesiveness \nin such a context.  In Brewer v. Ham, the Fifth Circuit—which has been more receptive to vote \ndilution claims predicated upon multiracial coalitions than any other circuit—held the standard for \ncohesion in such cases to be as follows: \nthe  determinative  question  is  whether  black-supported  candidates  receive  a \nmajority  of  the  Hispanic  and  Asian  vote;  whether  Hispanic-supported \ncandidates receive a majority of the black and Asian vote; and whether Asian-\nsupported candidates receive a majority of the black and Hispanic vote in most \ninstances in the [local district] area. \n14 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 15 of 31 PageID# 785\n \n \n \n876 F.2d 448, 454 (5th Cir. 1989) (citations omitted).  \n \nProving cohesion clearly becomes more difficult then, as more minority groups are added \nto a multiracial coalition.  This is likely why Plaintiffs have been unable to point to a single case \nwhere a tri-partite coalition claim has been successful. \nFurther, in keeping with the Supreme Court’s admonition in Growe, this definition of \ncohesion sets a bar far higher than merely establishing an ordinary political coalition—the latter \nbeing a loose agglomeration of various segments of an electorate, perhaps varying in composition \nfrom one election to another and whose constituent parts may be motivated by differing concerns. \nTo prove cohesion, on the other hand, “groups must be shown to vote together by some sort of \nreliable evidence for this Court to be able to make a finding of political cohesiveness. Brewer v. \nHam, 876 F.2d 448, 454 (emphasis added). \nAt a very minimum, Hall and many other Section 2 opinions must be read—consistent with \nthe Supreme Court’s rulings in Gingles and Growe—to require much more than proof of the \nexistence  of  an  ordinary  political  coalition  in order  satisfy  the  cohesion  requirement  for  a \nmultiracial coalition vote dilution claim.  As will be shown, Plaintiffs offer no evidence that could \nestablish the cohesion precondition. \nc.  Spencer’s Initial Report attempts to prove cohesion by presumption. \nThe Plaintiffs’ expert regarding cohesion, Spencer, concludes in his initial report (“Initial \nReport”) that “[t]here is strong evidence of voting cohesion between black voters and other \nminority group voters.”  (Ex. 4 at 3).  However, there is no competent evidence to support this \nconclusion because, as Spencer himself explained in his rebuttal report and in deposition testimony \n(and Lichtman explains in his deposition testimony), both the Asian and Hispanic populations lack \nthe size and geographic concentration necessary to create reliable estimates for Asian and Hispanic \n15 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 16 of 31 PageID# 786\n \n \nvoters as separate groups.  (Ex. 4 at 6, Ex. 5 at 8, Ex. 6 at 68-71, Ex. 8 at 58-62).  Spencer’s Initial \nReport does not produce a single data point regarding the voting patterns of Asian and Hispanic \nvoters by themselves.  (See generally Ex. 4). \nHow, then, does Spencer conclude that Blacks, Asians and Hispanics are cohesive with \neach other?  Spencer does so by disregarding the clear instruction of Growe and simply presumes \nthat these three groups vote together, banding them together in a repeated “All minority support” \ndata point for each candidate in the races he identifies as probative.  Spencer makes clear that “All \nMinority” includes Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities.  (Ex. 4 at 9, Ex 6. at 106).  He \nfurther admits that this “All minority support” data point cannot be used to isolate point estimates \nfor either Asian support or for Hispanic support. (Ex. 6 at 106-108).  This is a fact that is confirmed \nby Plaintiffs’ other retained expert, Dr. Allan Lichtman, and is undisputed in this case. Ex. 8 at 59-\n62.  This missing data is crucial to Plaintiffs’ effort to prove cohesion under Prong 2.  Without it, \nthey cannot carry their burden.  \nSpencer attempts to cover over this missing data from his Initial Report by with a sleight \nof hand.  For each candidate analyzed, Spencer provides a point estimate for Black voters alone \nand for “All minorit[ies].”  If both of these numbers are above 50%, it might appear at first glance \nthat minority voters were in fact cohesive.  That appearance is utterly deceiving.  An examination \nof Spencer’s estimated minority support levels for Dr. Amelia Ross-Hammond, a Black candidate \nin the 2016 election for the Kempsville seat, shows why this is so.  Spencer’s “King’s EI” estimate \nreports that Dr. Ross-Hammond achieved 76.7% support among Black voters and 59.9% “All \nminority support.”  (Ex. 4 at 15).  Consideration of the operation of averages leads to the conclusion \nthat, because Black voters are also included in the “All minority support” estimate, one must infer \n16 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 17 of 31 PageID# 787\n \n \nthat Asian and Hispanic combined support is far less than 59.9%.5  The inevitability of this \nconclusion can be demonstrated with a simple hypothetical. Imagine that Jack has 90 apples and \nthat Jack and Jill combined have an average of 50 apples.  It would be dishonest to suggest based \nupon these two data points that Jack and Jill both are both carrying a similar number of apples—\nsince the operation of averages requires the conclusion that Jill actually has only 10 apples (100 \ntotal apples divided by 2 people equals 50).6 \nIn the same way, it is wholly inaccurate to suggest that the two data points Spencer provides \nfor Dr. Ross-Hammond suggest that she has strong support from Asian and/or Hispanic voters.  \nWhat we can conclude is that the level of voter support of Asians, Hispanics, and other non-Black \nminority voters combined has significantly “dragged down” the 76.7% level of support of Blacks \nalone.  Further, while we have some general hint of what the non-Black minority support would \nbe for Dr. Ross-Hammond (it must be far below 59.9%), we still have no information about the \nestimated support levels of Asians alone and Hispanics alone. \nThe “black box” of Spencer’s All Minority data points in the Initial Report are patently \ninadequate for proving cohesion, even by Spencer’s own telling.  During his deposition testimony, \nSpencer was asked, “When you’re talking about three different distinct minority groups, what does \ncohesion mean to you?”  (Ex. 6 at 109).  Spencer explained, “My definition [of cohesion] would \nbe each group has the most preferred candidate, and the most preferred candidate of each three \n \n5 If Asian and Hispanic voters combined were equal in number to Black voters in the 2016 \nKempsville election, the operation of averages would dictate that the Asian and Hispanic \ncombined level of support for Ms. Ross-Hammond was 43.1%. This is a generous assumption to \nPlaintiffs, however, the total combined Asian and Hispanic population in Virginia Beach is \nconsiderably less than the Black population in the City. Further, unless Asians and Hispanics \nvoted in perfect lock step, one group would have given an even lower level of support for Ms. \nRoss-Hammond—possibly much lower. \n6 The data at issue in this case, involving estimated averages for voting support among groups \ncomprising many individuals, is more complicated than this simple “Jack and Jill” hypothetical; \nhowever, the underlying logic and algebraic operation of averages still apply. \n17 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 18 of 31 PageID# 788\n \n \ngroups is the same.” (Ex. 6 at 109.)7  Unfortunately, when Spencer was asked how he was “able \nto determine the individual group support” in order to determine candidate preferences for each \ngroup, he answered, “I did not attempt to do that.” (Ex. 6 at 119). \nAlthough the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has determined that \nmultiracial coalition claims may be valid, it has also admonished that “plaintiffs must prove that \nthe minorities so identified actually vote together.”  Campos v. Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240, (5th Cir. \n1988)  (emphasis  added).    Consistent  with  that  burden,  the  Fifth  Circuit  opined  that  “the \nmost persuasive evidence of inter-minority political cohesion for Section 2 purposes is to be found \nin voting patterns.”  Brewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 1989) (emphasis original).  \nWithout any evidence concerning the voting patterns of Asians as a distinct group or Hispanics as \na distinct group, it simply is impossible to perform the kind of cohesion inquiry that Spencer \nhimself calls for.  The undisputed fact that evidence necessary for Plaintiffs to carry their Prong 2 \nburden is completely absent is grounds for summary judgment in favor of the Defendants.  \nd.  Spencer’s Rebuttal Report: A novel and unsuccessful attempt to prove \ncohesion amongst black, Asian, and Hispanic voters. \n \nSpencer’  rebuttal  report  (“Rebuttal  Report”)  is  largely  an  attempt  to  remedy  the \ndeficiencies of the data he produced in his Initial Report.  The underlying data Spencer relies upon \nin his Rebuttal Report appears in a data set (“Spencer’s Data Set”) that finally provides separate \npoint estimates for both Asian and Hispanic voters—at least for a limited batch of candidates.  \nSpencer’s Data Set was produced to Defendants only after the Rebuttal Report was submitted, \nperhaps owing to the fact that the self-described “ridiculous” data contained therein reveals only \n \n7 Dr. Spencer’s definition, while arguably more permissive than the standard set for in Ham v. \nBrewer, has the virtue at least of requiring some separate analysis of each group and a \ncomparison of the groups’ preferences to each other (the former analysis being required to \nperform the latter comparison)—both necessary elements of any test of cohesion that would not \nrun roughshod over Growe and the case law from various circuit courts. \n18 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 19 of 31 PageID# 789\n \n \nthat black, Asian, and Hispanic voting patterns diverge wildly.  To remedy this problem, Spencer \nemploys a novel methodology, “equivalence testing,” in order to find the cohesion that Plaintiffs \nrequire to successfully make their claim.  By the conclusion of Spencer’s deposition, however, he \nconfirmed that equivalence testing is not at all appropriate as he applies it.  Further, Spencer \nattempted to distance himself from his own reported conclusions.  A more detailed description of \nthis surreal saga follows. \nIn his Rebuttal Report, Spencer confirms that, given the lack of any precincts in Virginia \nBeach with significant concentrations of Hispanic and Asian voters, the “precinct populations are \nsimply too small to draw reliable conclusions about the voting preferences of these groups \nindependently.”  (Ex. 5 at 6).  Spencer candidly admits the circular logic behind his initial \napproach, which manifestly presumes—and does not at all prove—that these groups are cohesive: \nthe “most reliable method for interpreting the candidate preferences of black, Hispanic, and Asian \nvoters is to estimate their joint vote share, which I reported in my original report in a category \ncalled “All Minority.”  (Ex. 5 at 6).  \nSpencer then proceeds to address a critique leveled by Defendants’ expert, Dr. Quentin \nKidd—the essence of which, as Spencer explains, is that a data point for “All Minority” support, \nor “coalition support” could be “driven by extreme support among black voters that masks weak \nsupport among Hispanic and Asian voters.”8  (Ex. 5 at 7).  Spencer does not dispute the plain logic \n \n8 It should be noted that, while a high degree of Black support for a candidate could indeed mask \nrelatively weak levels of support among Hispanic and Asian voters, as Dr. Spencer explains, \nanother possibility would equally undermine any claim of cohesion: that strong levels of Black \nsupport for a candidate could be coupled in some instances with strong support from one of the \nother two groups (e.g. Asians) and that the combined strong support of those two groups masks \nan extreme lack of support among the third group (e.g. Hispanics). The ultimate point, here, is \nthat a combined “All Minority” support data point provides no information about the support of \nAsian and Hispanic voters separately and does not allow for an analysis of whether these three \ngroups prefer the same candidates. \n19 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 20 of 31 PageID# 790\n \n \nof Dr. Kidd’s critique, but states that “the evidence suggests that the voting preferences of black, \nHispanic, and Asian voters are not distinguishable from each other.”  (Ex. 5 at 7).  The following \nTable A—a distillation of Spencer’s Data Set—exposes the facial absurdity of that claim.  (See \nEx. 7). \nTable A—Spencer’s Data for Black and Asian Support for Various Candidates \nCandidate (Year)  Estimated Black Support  Estimated Asian Support \nRouse (2018)  83.0%  53.0% \nWooten (2018)  90.3%  73.4% \nWhite (2018)  61.1%  19.6% \nRoss-Hammond (2016)  81.2%  26.2% \nCabiness (2014)  70.2%  9.4% \nHenley (2014)  62.4%  82.9% \nRoss-Hammond (2012)  82.6%  33.6% \nSherrod (2011)  90.2%  27.2% \nJackson (2010)  52.9%  6.9% \nBellitto (2010)  8.4%  47.2% \nBullock (2010)  79.0%  87.9% \nAllen (2008)  79.4%  29.8% \nFlores (2008)  52.9%  33.9% \n \nThe data in Table A constitutes a fatal blow to the Plaintiffs’ case, demonstrating not only \nthat  black  and  Asian  support  levels  are  easily  distinguishable  from  one  another,  but  more \nspecifically that these two groups do not support the same candidates in a large majority of cases.  \nIn other words, Blacks and Asians are not politically cohesive under Spencer’s own data.  In fact, \na comparison of Spencer’s estimated levels of white support for these same candidates, which are \nprovided in his Initial Report, demonstrates that Asian voting patterns actually track white voting \npatterns much more closely than those of Blacks.  Furthermore, an examination of Spencer’s Data \nSet reveals that in only six (6) of thirteen (13) races presented did a majority of both blacks and \nHispanics support the candidates listed.  Finally, in only three (3) of thirteen (13) races do all three \nminority groups give greater than 50% support for the same candidate. \n20 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 21 of 31 PageID# 791\n \n \nGiven this startling data, Plaintiffs cannot possibly satisfy the cohesion definitions set forth \nby Spencer himself and by the Fifth Circuit in Brewer v. Ham.  Both standards properly require \nthat Plaintiffs prove cohesion amongst a multiracial coalition by demonstrating that each of these \ngroups share the same preferred candidates.  According to Spencer’s own data, that simply is not \nthe case.  Perhaps this is why—excepting data regarding candidate Aaron Rouse in 2018—\nSpencer’s Data Set was not included in his Rebuttal Report and was produced later, upon request \nfrom Defendants’ counsel. \nAs devastating as the Table 1 data is to Plaintiffs’ case, Spencer was not deterred in his \nattempt to establish the cohesion that Plaintiffs must prove in this case.  To do so, Spencer \n“adopt[ed] the logic of equivalence testing” to his estimates of Asian and Hispanic voter support, \ndescribing his methodology on pages 8 and 9 of his Rebuttal Report.  Spencer states that his \nequivalence testing methodology “compares the distributions of black, Hispanic, and Asian vote \nshares . . . against the threshold needed” for victory in a given councilmanic race. (Ex. 5 at 9.) \nTo  further  explain  his  “equivalence  testing”  approach,  Spencer  uses  data  regarding \nminority voter support levels for African American candidate Aaron Rouse.  He states that Rouse \ngarnered an estimated 70% (  6%) of the black vote; 53% (  15.24%) of the Asian vote; and 34% \n(  20.9%) of the Hispanic vo±te.  (Ex. 5 at 7-8).  The “thresho±ld” for victory, a standard for cohesion \na±pparently of Spencer’s own invention, is 45.2%.  (Ex. 5 at 7).  Spencer’s premise—one without \napparent support in case law—is that if each minority group’s level of support exceeds the victory \nthreshold, cohesion exists.  One might assume that, as Spencer’s point estimate for Hispanic \nsupport (33.3%) falls well below his self-identified threshold (45.2%), Spencer would conclude \nthat Hispanics did not share blacks’ and Asians’ apparent preference for candidate Rouse.  (Ex. 7).  \nNot so.  As the table on Page 8 of the Rebuttal Report indicates, Spencer found a way—against all \n21 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 22 of 31 PageID# 792\n \n \nodds and common sense—to determine that Rouse was the preferred candidate of Hispanic voters.  \n(Ex. 5 at 8, Table 1). \nIn his search for cohesion, applying more than a little creativity to data he himself \ncharacterizes as not reliable takes Spencer a long way.  (Ex. 5 at 6).  As Spencer explains, he does \nnot require his point estimate itself to exceed his identified “threshold” in order to conclude that a \ngiven candidate is preferred by the minority group in question.  Rather, he requires only that there \nis “at least 10% overlap [of the voter support distribution range] with the threshold.”  (Ex. 5 at 9).  \nA 10% overlap of a distribution range9 with the threshold indicates, however, only a small \npossibility that the group in question preferred a given candidate.  As Spencer admits, where there \nis 10% overlap above the threshold, “90 percent in that case would be [be]low.”10  (Ex. 6 at 141). \nAs “admittedly permissive” as this 10% overlap standard is according to Spencer, he is \ngiven an additional assist by the unreliability of his data (data which he, ironically, relies upon for \nhis equivalence testing approach).  (Ex. 5 at 9).  In fact, in Spencer’s quest for 10% overlap, the \nmore unreliable a point estimate is, the better.  Rouse’s support among Hispanic voters is a perfect \nexample.  Spencer states in his deposition testimony that there is a corresponding “confidence \ninterval” of approximately plus or minus 42%, meaning that Hispanic voter support for Rouse \nranged from approximately (– 6%) to 75%.  (Ex. 6 at 133-37). Spencer’s hand-drawn modifications \nto Spencer’s Deposition Exhibit #7 provide a rough approximation of the confidence interval under \n \n9 The distribution range is produced by extending a confidence interval, which is given alongside \na  , in both directions from a point estimate. (E.g. A point estimate of 20% with a  5 \nconfidence interval will result in a distribution range from 15% to 25%). (Ex. 6 at 131-133). \n10 \"A±s \"Dr. Spencer indicated in his deposition testimony, a “bell curve” applies to the d ±istribution \nrange, meaning that a 10% overlap with the threshold does not indicate a 10% probability that \nthe actual support level is above the threshold. In fact, in such an instance, there is a far smaller \nprobability that the support level is above the threshold. (Ex. 6 at 136 (Deposition Exhibit #6) \nand 140 (Deposition Exhibit #7). \n22 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 23 of 31 PageID# 793\n \n \ndiscussion.  Spencer checks the box for Hispanic support of Rouse in Table 1 because a tiny portion \nof the huge distribution range exceeds the threshold.  \nNotably, Spencer’s data indicates that a much larger part of the distribution range for \nHispanic voter support for Mr. Rouse is below the 45.2 threshold than above it.  It is hard to \nconceive how, in light of this fact, anyone could conclude that Hispanics preferred Rouse.  The \nabsurdity of such a conclusion becomes even more apparent when one considers the results that \nwould follow had Spencer’s point estimate of Hispanic voter support been more reliable.  For \nexample, if the standard error had been 4.3 (the median standard error for the more reliable black \nvoter support estimates on Spencer’s Data Set), the resultant confidence interval would be   \n8.43%,11 yielding a distribution range of 24.87% to 41.73%.  This smaller range does not overla±p \nwith the 45.2% threshold at all.  Stated differently, a more reliable estimate for Hispanic voter \nsupport would require the conclusion that Rouse was not the preferred candidate of Hispanic \nvoters.  Fortunately for Spencer, he was not hamstrung with the inconvenience of such reliable \nnumbers.  To his credit, when Spencer was asked, “So the less reliable the number, the better \nchance it has of going across the threshold?” he answered with candor, “Totally.”  (Ex. 6 at 138). \nMoreover, Spencer himself ultimately admitted that using his equivalence testing approach \nin the present context was deeply problematic.  Not only was Spencer unaware of equivalence \ntesting ever having been used in any Voting Rights Act case, he stated that he “frankly would not \nuse equivalence testing in a voting rights case but for responding to a criticism about regular null \nhypotheses.”  (Ex. 6 at 145).  Spencer goes on to explain that this is because, “[t]he equivalence \ntest is even more permissive.  As you pointed out, you’re rejecting [the null hypothesis of \ndifference between two groups] with only 10 percent overlap.”  (Ex. 6 at 145).  Spencer provided \n \n11 Spencer testified that the confidence interval is arrived at by multiplying the standard error by \n1.96. (Ex. 6 at 44) \n23 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 24 of 31 PageID# 794\n \n \nanother rationale for why equivalence testing cannot be relied upon, stating, “if my baseline \nassumption is an equivalence test, I’m going to have everything across the threshold, because the \nthreshold is smaller and the estimates we get here are so ridiculous, ridiculously big.”  (Ex. 6 at \n146) (emphasis added).  Defendants could not agree more with this assessment. \nIt makes little sense for Spencer to respond to a general critique that he merely had assumed \ncohesion among black, Asian, and Hispanic voters using deceptive operation of averages by \nemploying a methodology that produced conclusions about Black, Hispanic, and Asian cohesion \nregarding which he stated, “I am not confident in their findings at all”—further explaining that the \nsize of the confidence intervals are “ridiculous to begin with, which is why I wouldn’t have done \nthis originally.”  (Ex. 6 at 125-127).12 \nThe answer for this flailing second attempt at proving cohesion may lie in Plaintiffs’ \nrecognition that the data in Spencer’s Initial Report was not sufficient to prove cohesion.  As Dr. \nAllan Lichtman, another of Plaintiffs’ experts, testified repeatedly, any point estimates for Asian \nand Hispanic voting in Virginia Beach “[w]on’t be reliable” because of “the error margins are \ngoing to be large.”  (Ex. 8 at 58-60).  According to Lichtman, one cannot “isolate Hispanic and \nAsian voting” reliably, “which is why you’ve got to use the equivalence testing analysis.”  (Ex. 8 \nat 58).  Lichtman, however, who has been retained on an expert regarding voting rights in upwards \n \n12 In his deposition testimony, Dr. Spencer claimed that he “generated [a table based on his \nequivalence testing method] in response to some comments made by Dr. Kidd to try to – to try to \npoint out exactly why I didn’t do this in my original report.” (Ex. 6 at 125-126.) This rationale is \na marked departure from the way he presented his equivalence testing-based findings in his \nRebuttal Report, wherein he introduced his equivalence testing as a way to “make sense of this \nuncertainty” regarding unreliable estimates for Hispanic and Asian vote shares. (Ex. 5 at 8). He \nfollows this by stating, “To draw my conclusions, I adopt the logic of equivalence testing.” (Ex. \n5 at 8). Nowhere in his Rebuttal Report does Dr. Spencer mention that these conclusions were \nbased on ‘ridiculous’ or unreliable data or that he was only performing equivalence testing to \nshow why he had not isolated the three minority groups in the first place. If that was Dr. \nSpencer’s intention from the outset, the language of his Rebuttal Report is deeply misleading.  \n \n24 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 25 of 31 PageID# 795\n \n \nof 90 cases, (Ex. 8 at 30), is “only casually aware of” equivalence testing—predominantly from \nliterature in “psychology and biology,” (Ex. 8 at 225).  Lichtman, like Spencer, could not cite a \nsingle case where equivalence testing had been used in a Voting Rights Act case.  (Ex. 8 at 223).  \nLichtman explained that equivalence testing is “just a comparison” of different groups, (Ex. 8 at \n222), and does not itself allow for a reliable isolation of Hispanic and Asian voters, (Ex. 8 at  \n226).13   \nIn sum, Lichtman’s testimony is that, because it is not possible to produce reliable estimates \nof Hispanic and Asian voter support, “you’ve got to” to use a methodology he knows little about, \nhas never seen in a Voting Rights Act case, and which does nothing to make those unreliable point \nestimates reliable.  Lichtman also appears unaware that Spencer was “not confident” in the findings \nof equivalence testing “at all” despite Lichtman’s own suggestion that “you’ve got to use the \nequivalence testing analysis” in this case.    \nIt is undisputed that, given the huge confidence intervals that correspond to Spencer’s data, \nprecise conclusions about Asian and Hispanic voting patterns alone cannot be reached with any \nlevel of reliability or certainty for Virginia Beach.  It is further undisputed that Spencer’s Initial \nReport makes no effort to isolate Hispanic and Asian voting estimates.  That Spencer later \nproduced a Data Set that point strongly towards a lack of cohesion among blacks, Asians, and \nHispanics is a bell that cannot be un-rung.  Spencer’s gambit to save this case by using a misapplied \nmethodology is to no avail.  The reverberations of Spencer’s Data Set and Table 1 (which was \nbased upon that data set) are deafening, drowning out any chance Plaintiffs can meet their burden \nto prove cohesion among these three groups. \n \n13 Lichtman was asked, “Would you say that equivalency testing is a method to reliably isolate \nHispanics and Asians?” He answered, “Not to estimate their particular percentage of voting for \nany individual candidate. No, that’s not what it does.” (Ex. 8 at 226.) \n25 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 26 of 31 PageID# 796\n \n \nSimply put, without isolated, reliable estimates of Hispanic and Asian voting preferences, \nPlaintiffs cannot carry their burden of establishing the political cohesiveness of their concocted tri-\npartite minority group of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians under Prong 2.  To the extent Spencer \nchooses to rely upon his admittedly unreliable method of equivalence testing to cure this defect, \nSpencer’s Rebuttal Report only serves the purpose of further proving there is no triable issue of \nfact that in this matter where it appears from Plaintiffs’ expert’s own data that Asian voters are \nclearly not politically cohesive with Black voters in Virginia Beach. For these reasons, summary \njudgment should be granted in favor of the Defendants.  \nII.  Gingles Prong 3: The analysis is mooted by a lack of cohesion among Black, \nAsian and Hispanic voters; however, Spencer’s own data indicates his \nidentified minority-preferred candidates usually win elections. \n \nAs demonstrated in the prior section, Spencer’s own data, reports, and deposition testimony \nproves that Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden to demonstrate that Black, Asian, and Hispanic \nvoters are cohesive.  Because of this lack of cohesion, Plaintiffs’ vote dilution claim must fail.  \nInquiries regarding the two other Gingles prongs and the totality of the circumstances are entirely \nmoot.  Even assuming, arguendo, that cohesion does exist, however, Spencer’s conclusion that his \nidentified  minority  preferred  candidates  usually  win  election  presents  yet  another  fact  that \ndefinitively precludes Plaintiffs from prevailing on Prong 3 and thus defeats their claim. \na.  The Impossible Inquiry: Whether the White Majority Votes Sufficiently as a \nBlock Usually to Defeat the Minority Preferred Candidates of a Coalition that \nDoes Not Exist  \n \nGingles  Prong  3  requires  Plaintiffs  to  “demonstrate  that  the  white  majority  votes \nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” 478 \nU.S. at 51 (emphasis added). The Fourth Circuit and other circuits have consistently held “usually” \nto mean more than half the time.  See Lewis v. Alamance County, 99 F.3d 600, 606 (4th Cir. 1996) \n(\"Suffice it to say that ['usually,' 'normally,' and 'generally'] mean something more than just 51%.\").  \n26 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 27 of 31 PageID# 797\n \n \nIn Levy v. Lexington County, the Fourth Circuit explained that a court must “first identify those \nindividuals who constitute minority-preferred candidates of choice, and then analyze whether \nthose candidates are usually defeated by majority White bloc voting.” 589 F.3d 708, 716 (2009). \n In the instant case, Gingles Prong 3 poses a conundrum: how does one determine the \npreferred candidate of a cohesive minority bloc that does not actually exist?  Here, because there \nis no cohesive block of Black, Asian, and Hispanic voters, the Prong 3 inquiry cannot be conducted \nin a meaningful manner. \nNevertheless, even granting the Plaintiffs a host of favorable assumptions required even to \nattempt a Prong 3 analysis, they cannot meet their burden in this regard on the evidence Plaintiffs \nplan to offer this Court. \nb.  Even by the tally of Plaintiffs’ own expert, minority-preferred candidates \nusually win election, definitively defeating their Prong 3 claim. \n \nIn Spencer’s Rebuttal Report, he produced “Table 1,” which he admits in deposition \ntestimony ultimately indicates that a majority of the candidates he identifies as minority-preferred \nhave won election—a remarkable contention given that Plaintiffs need to prove the exact opposite.  \nIt is a rare occasion that a party’s own expert creates a graphic that so clearly deals a fatal blow to \ntheir own case, and the context of Table 1 bears further examination. \nIn Table 1, Spencer claims to “present a summary of minority support for the thirteen \ncandidates (ten black, three white) that I identified as minority candidates of choice in my [original] \nreport.”  (Ex. 5 at 7).  Table 1 is compiled based upon Spencer’s equivalence testing approach.  \n(Ex. 5 at 7, Ex. 6 at 124).  The virtue of Table 1 is that it at least feints towards consideration of \nthe actual preferences of Asians and Hispanics by relying upon Spencer’s point estimates for these \nindividual groups.  The problem for Plaintiffs is that Spencer’s Data Set, which informs his Table \n1, demonstrates clearly that these three groups did not in fact generally share candidate preferences, \n27 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 28 of 31 PageID# 798\n \n \nas discussed supra.  Spencer’s adoption of the logic of equivalence testing—which he thoroughly \ndiscredited in his deposition testimony—was an attempt to ‘cure’ data in his Initial Report that \nmissed the mark.  \nEven  the  magic  of  equivalence  testing,  however,  cannot  support  Spencer’s  original \nconclusions—according to Spencer himself.  In compiling Table 1, Spencer changes his testimony \nregarding how many candidates of choice there actually were for the elections he considered \nprobative.  Spencer marks only eight (8) of those thirteen (13) candidates with a “Y” in Table 1’s \n“Minority preferred?” column.  (Ex. 5 at 8 (Table 1)).  Spencer uses the term “minority preferred” \ninterchangeably with “minority candidates of choice.”  (Ex. 6 at 77).  Moreover, Spencer admitted \nthat—applying the numbers reported on Spencer’s Data Set—his identification of candidate Flores \nas the minority-preferred candidate could no longer be supported.  (Ex. 6 at 148-52).  Therefore, \nSpencer could only identify seven (7) minority candidates of choice going all the way back to \n2008.  (Ex. 6 at 152).  Of those seven (7), four (4) won election: Rouse (2018), Wooten (2018), \nHenley (2014), and Ross-Hammond (2012). (Ex. 6 at 152; Ex. 7 at 8 (Table 1)). Stated as a \npercentage,  57%  of  Plaintiffs’  identified  minority-preferred  candidates  have  won  election.  \nPlaintiffs’ own expert’s data thus forecloses any chance that they could prove that a white majority \nvotes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat minority-preferred candidates. \nAs staggering as the four-of-seven data point is, it must be remembered that Table 1 reflects \nSpencer’s own framing of which elections are probative—a framing that could not be any more \nfavorable to Plaintiffs.  Spencer conveniently omits, for example, all three elections wherein \nGeorge Furman, an African American, ran for office.  Despite defining probative elections as \n“previous city council races that featured a minority candidate,” Spencer claims that the races \ninvolving Furman are not probative because Furman was not a viable candidate—this despite the \nfact that in the 2010 Bayside race, Furman garnered more All Minority support than Pieri Burton, \n28 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 29 of 31 PageID# 799\n \n \nanother African-America candidate, in the Princess Anne race.  (Ex. 4 at 19, 27).  Inexplicably, \nSpencer does consider the Burton race probative.  (Ex. 6 at 97).  Were all three Furman races \nincluded, Spencer’s Table 1 would, inconveniently for Plaintiffs, include three more races where \nthe candidates he initially defined as minority candidates of choice – Sessoms (2016), Davenport \n(2014), and Jones (2010) – all won election. \nDefendants contend that the races involving George Furman are probative.  Defendants \nalso contend that Spencer’s proposed universe of elections spans too far back in time.  Courts have \nconsistently made clear that more recent elections are more probative than older ones.  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Charleston County, 365 F.3d 341, 350 (4th Cir. 2004) (citing cases from the 2nd, \n3rd and 9th Circuits). This is particularly true in a case like the one at bar, wherein Plaintiffs have \nalleged—correctly—that the minority population of Virginia Beach has grown dramatically in \nrecent years.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31, 32).  As that minority population grows, minority voters rightly \nshould have an ever-increasing voice in determining who is elected to City Council.  As Spencer’s \nTable 1 demonstrates in stark terms, the voice of minority voters has been heard loud and clear in \nrecent elections.  It makes little sense to go back to elections more than a decade in the past—and \nto a time before the last decennial census and the last redistricting—since the Court can obtain an \naccurate current picture of minority voters’ ability to elect candidates of their choosing by \nexamining the five elections that have occurred since the 2010 decennial census took place: 2011 \n(a special election), 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018.  Ultimately, any shortening of the timespan in \nquestion and/or inclusion of all elections that featured a minority candidate will only strengthen \nthe conclusion: Plaintiffs cannot carry their burden as to Prong 3. \nFortunately, the Court has a sound basis for granting summary judgment on Prong 3 \nwithout having to resolve any underlying disputes as to the most appropriate election cycles to \nconsider: the legal validity of Spencer’s standard for identifying minority-preferred candidates; the \n29 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 115   Filed 10/22/19   Page 30 of 31 PageID# 800\n \n \npropriety of Spencer’s use of a methodology (equivalence testing) that produces findings he has \nno confidence in; or the determination of which elections are probative in resolving Gingles Prong \n3 against Plaintiffs.  Table 1 represents the most favorable possible framing to Plaintiffs regarding \nwhich races are probative and which candidates are minority-preferred.  And yet, even granting to \nPlaintiffs the multiple layers of assumptions required to consider Table 1 at face value, Plaintiffs’ \nown data shows they cannot meet their burden to prove that the white majority in Virginia Beach \nvotes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat minority candidates of choice. \nCONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE, for all the reasons set forth herein, the Defendants hereby respectfully \nrequest that this Court grant the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, dismiss the Amended \nComplaint with prejudice and for such other relief as the Court deems appropriate. \n            Respectfully submitted, \nCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH, et al.  \n \nBy: _____________/s/___________________ \n                         Of Counsel \nMark D.

Defendants’ motion for summary judgment misrepresents Plaintiffs’ expert \nanalysis and ignores other evidence in an effort to conceal genuine disputes of material fact. The \nCourt should therefore deny summary judgment and set this case for trial. \nSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL DISPUTED FACTS \n \n  Plaintiffs do not dispute Facts 1-2, 4-5, 8-9, 11-19, 23, 26, 28, 32, 36 and 38 in Defendants’ \nstatement of material facts (ECF No. 115 at 2-7). Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56(B), Plaintiffs \ndispute the following facts in the Defendants’ statement of material facts: \nDefs. Fact No. 3: Plaintiffs dispute this fact to the extent that it attempts to define all opin-\nions being offered by Plaintiffs’ expert Anthony Fairfax. In addition to the opinions outlined by \nDefendants, Mr. Fairfax offered opinions on past and recent demographics pertaining to the City \nof Virginia Beach, Defs. Ex. 1 at 2, as well as the possibility of drawing at least one district with \na majority Black and Hispanic Citizen Voting Age Population (“CVAP”). Defs. Ex. 2 at 3. \nDefs. Fact No. 6: Plaintiffs dispute Defendants’ allegation that Mr. Fairfax’s Initial Report \n“purported” to contain a ten-district map with two majority Hispanic, Black, and Asian majority \ndistricts. See, e.g., Defs. Ex. 1 at 20-21. To the extent Defendants dispute this fact, it is a genuine \nissue to be litigated in this case. \nDefs. Fact No. 7: Plaintiffs dispute this fact as incomplete. This fact is correct as alleged \nwith respect to single race alone CVAP percentages, but Plaintiffs dispute that this is the only \n  1 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 4 of 44 PageID# 2273\nrelevant statistic. The second relevant measure includes mixed race individuals (those who identify \nas Black and white). The CVAP percentages including persons who identify as mixed race in \nPlaintiffs’ Illustrative Districts 1 and 2 are 51.11% and 51.08% respectively. Defs. Ex. 1 at 21. \nDefs. Fact No. 10: Plaintiffs dispute this fact to the extent that Mr. Fairfax also testified \nthat “it is extremely difficult, if not impossible” to calculate the margin of error for disaggregated \nACS data, Defs. Ex. 3 at 191:18-192:19, and that doing so is “not seen in normal plan development \nfor redistricting plans” and that he “ha[s] not seen any confidence level . . . produced in a proposed \ndistrict plan out of the hundreds that [he] has seen.” Id. at 217:18-218:11. \nDefs. Fact No. 20: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. Dr. Spencer never testified that Hispanic \nvoters or Asian voters were “too insufficiently concentrated in precincts in Virginia Beach to pro-\nduce reliable estimates.” In fact, Dr. Spencer testified “I’m not sure I know anything about [those \nvoters’] geographic dispersion” at his deposition. Defs. Ex. 6 at 70:14-71:4. \nDefs. Fact Nos. 21 and 22: Plaintiffs dispute these facts. Dr. Spencer noted that whether a \nminority candidate was running was a “starting point” for determining probative elections. Defs. \nEx. 6 at 71:21-72:8. Dr. Spencer then excluded three races involving the Black candidate George \nFurman as non-probative, because Furman “ran against seven different candidates and came in last \nevery single time. More importantly . . . minority [voters] preferred Mr. Furman’s opponents every \nsingle time, meaning elections that featured Mr. Furman are not probative of potential racially \npolarized voting.” Defs. Ex. 5 at 2, n.1, 10; Defs. Ex. 4 at 3, 7 n.7, 39-41. \nDefs. Fact No. 24: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. Dr. Spencer testified that “he would reserve \nthe right to confirm that” Louis Jones was the candidate of choice in 2010 because the statistical \nestimates for that election “don’t have asterisks next to them, which is [Dr. Spencer’s] designation \nthat there’s a statistically significant difference between the vote totals.” Defs. Ex. 6 at 96:6-15. \n  2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 5 of 44 PageID# 2274\nDefs. Fact No. 25: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Lichtman’s two expert \nreports also contain “Gingles Prongs 2 and 3 voting pattern data and analysis that was provided to \nthe Defendants on or before Plaintiffs’ rebuttal report disclosure deadline.” Pls. Ex. 1 at 21; Pls. \nEx. 2 at 2-10. In addition, Dr. Lichtman provided a supplemental table and chart R3-A to the \nDefendants at the Defendants’ request. Defs. Ex. 8 at 215:21-219:20; Pls. Ex. 3. \nDefs. Fact No. 27: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. As explained above in response to Facts 21, \n22 and 24, Dr. Spencer specifically identified the races involving candidate George Furman as \nnon-probative in his reports. Defs. Ex. 4 at 3, 7 n.7, 39-41; Defs. Ex. 5 at 2, n.1, 10. \nDefs. Fact No. 29: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. Defendants’ accounting of events is errone-\nous. Plaintiffs first provided Dr. Spencer’s individual point estimates for all the candidates listed \nin Table 1 of Dr. Spencer’s rebuttal report as a file titled “Spencer_script.R” with the disclosure of \nDr. Spencer’s rebuttal report on August 26, 2019. Pls. Ex. 4. However, Defendants do not have an \nexpert competent to analyze Dr. Spencer’s code. Pls. Ex 5 at 53:6-18. Thus, they requested via \nemail that Plaintiffs provide this data to them in chart form on August 30, 2019. Pls. Ex. 6. Plain-\ntiffs provided Dr. Spencer’s individual estimates to them a second time on September 5, 2019, \nwhich is Defendants’ Exhibit 7. \nDefs. Fact No. 30: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. The quote from Dr. Spencer’s rebuttal report \nis taken out of context. Defs. Ex. 5 at 8.  \nDefs. Fact No. 31: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. Dr. Spencer testified that he only calculated \nthe individual point estimates for Hispanic and Asian voters and the equivalence testing analysis \ncontained in Table 1 of his rebuttal report in response to Defendants’ expert Dr. Kidd’s critiques. \nDefs. Ex. 5 at 6-8; Defs. Ex. 6 at 143:9-146:5; 153:17-154:4. \n  3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 6 of 44 PageID# 2275\nDefs. Fact No. 33: Plaintiffs dispute this fact. The relevant threshold for analyzing the \nresults of Ex. 7 is not a 50% threshold, but rather the vote percentage that the winning candidate \nreceived in the race. Defs. Ex. 6 at 128:1-129:22.  \nIn addition, in many of the races included in Defendants’ Exhibit 7, more than two candi-\ndates ran for each seat in question, meaning only 33% plus one vote could be enough to win, not \n50%. Defs. Ex. 5 at 4-6. The races in Defendants’ Exhibit 7 that involved more than two candidates \ninclude the two 2018 at-large seats, the 2018 Centerville seat, the 2014 Rose Hall seat, the 2012 \nKemspville seat, the 2011 at-large seat, both 2010 at-large seats, the 2008 at-large seat, and the \n2008 Kempsville seat, for a total of 10 out of 13 races considered. Defs. Ex. 4 at 12-29; Defs. Ex. \n5 at 15; Defs. Ex. 7. Thus, if the applicable alternative threshold for each race (50+1% for two-\ncandidate races, and 33+1% for races with three candidates or more) is used instead of Dr. Spen-\ncer’s more conservative threshold, 12 out of 13 candidates would pass the relevant threshold for \nboth Black and Hispanic support when considering the confidence intervals, and 9 out of 13 can-\ndidates could pass the relevant threshold for Hispanic, Black, and Asian support. Defs. Ex. 7. \nFurther, even using a 50% threshold, Defendants are not considering the confidence inter-\nval for the estimates in their Exhibit 7, which is improper. Defs. Ex. 8 at 67:19-68:9; Defs Ex. 6 at \n125:11-127:5. The confidence interval is the standard error multiplied by 1.96. Id. at 44:2-17. \nWhen the confidence interval is considered, at least 10 of the 13 candidates analyzed could have \nreceived 50% or more support from both Black and Hispanic voters. Defs. Ex. 7. Further, at least \nseven candidates could have received 50% or greater support from Hispanic, Black and Asian \nvoters according to Defendants’ Exhibit 7 if the confidence interval is considered.

Fact No. 37: Plaintiffs dispute this fact to the extent that Defendants allege that Dr. \nLichtman testified equivalence testing is “needed” to compare voting behavior between Hispanic, \nBlack, and Asian voters in Virginia Beach.

Summary Judgment \nA party seeking summary judgment must show “that there is no genuine dispute as to any \nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). The \ncourt is “obliged to view the facts and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party.” Gordon v. Schilling, 937 F.3d 348, 356 (4th Cir. 2019) (quo-\ntation omitted). \nII.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act  \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”) prohibits any state or political subdivision \nfrom imposing or applying voting requirements or procedures in a manner that denies or restricts \nthe right of any United States citizen to vote “on account of race or color, or [membership in a \nlanguage minority group], as provided in subsection (b).” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). To vindicate this \nright against an at-large or districting scheme, plaintiffs must satisfy three “necessary precondi-\ntions.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50 (1986). “The minority group must be ‘sufficiently \nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district,’ (2) the \nminority group must be ‘politically cohesive,’ and (3) the majority must vote ‘sufficiently as a bloc \nto enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.’” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 \nU.S. 1, 11 (2009) (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50–51). Additionally, plaintiffs must show, based \non the “totality of the circumstances,” that protected minority voters “have less opportunity than \nother members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives \nof their choice.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). In conducting the totality of the circumstances analysis, \n  6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 9 of 44 PageID# 2278\ncourts should consider the factors listed in the Senate committee report to the VRA’s 1982 amend-\nments. See Gingles, 478 at 36–37; Levy v. Lexington County, S.C., 589 F.3d 708, 713 (4th Cir. \n2009).  \nIn Section 2 cases, summary judgment “presents particular challenges due to the fact-\ndriven nature of the legal tests required by the Supreme Court.” Ga. State Conference of NAACP \nv. Fayette Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 775 F.3d 1336, 1348 (11th Cir. 2015).

Virginia  Beach’s  At-Large  City  Council  System  Dilutes  the  Combined  Voting \nStrength of Hispanic, Black, and Asian Voters \n \nA.  A Coalition of Minority Groups Can Bring a Claim Together Under Section 2  \nA coalition of two or more politically cohesive minority groups can bring a claim together \nunder Section 2. While the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have not expressly addressed the \nquestion,1 the Second, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits have each ruled that coalition claims are cog-\nnizable under Section 2. See Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Representation v. City of Bridgeport, 26 \nF.3d 271, 276–77 (2nd Cir. 1994), vacated on other grounds, 512 U.S. 1283 (1994); Concerned \nCitizens of Hardee Cnty. v. Hardee Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 906 F.2d 524, 526 (11th Cir. 1990); \nCampos v. City of Baytown, Tex., 840 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1988). The Ninth Circuit has \nimplicitly agreed, explaining, in a coalitional Section 2 case, that “[p]laintiffs must be able to show \n \n1 The Supreme Court has expressly declined to reach this issue. See Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13–14. \nBut when the issue has arisen, the Supreme Court assumed without deciding that coalition districts \nwould be permissible. Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41 (1993). \n  7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 10 of 44 PageID# 2279\nthat minorities have in the past voted cohesively for minorities and have the potential to elect \nminority representatives.” Badillo v. City of Stockton, Cal., 956 F.2d 884, 891 (9th Cir. 1992).2  \nThe prevailing rule allowing coalition claims under Section 2 is correct. Section 2 protects \n“any citizen” against denial or abridgement of voting rights on account of race, color, or member-\nship in a language minority. 52 U.S.C. 10301(a). With this inclusive language, Congress recog-\nnized that discrimination in voting is not a problem limited to any one race, but a legacy of white \nsupremacy that can affect and has affected all people of color. It would be anomalous to conclude \nthat when those voters’ common experience of discrimination leads to inter-minority collective \naction, Congress’s chosen safeguard would be powerless to protect those coalitions against voting \ndiscrimination.  \nThe Fifth Circuit’s decision in LULAC Council No. 4386 v. Midland Independent School \nDistrict illustrates the commonsense logic of Section 2 coalition claims. See 812 F.2d 1494, 1495 \n(5th Cir. 1987), vacated on other grounds, 829 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1987) (en banc). In that case, a \ncoalition of Black and Hispanic voters challenged the at-large structure of their local school board. \nThe record showed a history of discrimination against both groups; resulting socioeconomic dis-\nparities; and consistent defeat of both groups’ preferred candidates by white bloc voting. Id. at \n1496–99. These circumstances led Black and Hispanic voters to the “realization that, at least in \nMidland, Texas, they have common social, economic, and political interests which converge and \n \n2 A district court in the First Circuit, adjudicating the claims of a Hispanic and Asian coalition of \nvoters, recently adopted the prevailing view. See Huot v. City of Lowell, 280 F. Supp. 3d 228, 231 \n(D. Mass. 2017). The plaintiffs and defendants later settled via consent decree. See Consent De-\ncree, Huot v. City of Lowell, No. 1:17-cv-10895 (D. Mass. Oct. 9, 2019), ECF No. 109. \n  8 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 11 of 44 PageID# 2280\nmake them a cohesive political group.” Id. at 1501. Consequently, the court affirmed the district \ncourt’s remedial order imposing single-member districts. Id. at 1503.3 \nDefendants nevertheless urge this Court to follow the lone exception to the prevailing view, \nNixon v. Kent County, in which the Sixth Circuit ruled that Section 2 does not permit coalition-\nbased claims of discriminatory results. 76 F.3d 1381, 1393 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc). That decision \ncannot withstand scrutiny and this Court should decline to follow it.  \nThe decision misinterprets the text of the statute. It suggests that Section 2 excludes coali-\ntion claims because subsection (b) refers to “participation by members of a class of citizens pro-\ntected by subsection (a).” Id. at 1386-87 (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b)). But nothing in the statute \nrequires every member of such a “class” to share the same race, as opposed to sharing the same \nexperience of being politically excluded on account of race. “[A] class of citizens protected by \nsubsection (a)” means just that—a class of individuals who are protected by subsection (a) against \ndenial or abridgement of their individual right to vote. In this case, the minority coalition consists \nof three groups whose members are each protected by the VRA. Together, the coalition members \nhere, each wielding the right conferred by subsection (a), are the “class of citizens” that subsection \n(b) protects.4  \n \n3 The en banc Fifth Circuit later vacated the panel decision on other grounds. See LULAC Council \nNo. 4386, 829 F.2d at 547–48. The Fifth Circuit has since adhered to the panel’s ruling that Section \n2 allows coalition claims. See, e.g., Brewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 1989); Campos, \n840 F.2d at 1244. \n4 Moreover, Nixon also depended on dubious “policy concerns” that the Gingles framework was \ncreated to resolve regardless of the minority group or groups involved. Nixon suggests that even if \nCongress found discrimination against two minority groups, “there is no basis for presuming such \na finding regarding a group consisting of a mixture of both minorities.” 76 F.3d at 1391. But the \nfact that two racial minorities together shoulder the burdens of discrimination in voting should not \nnegate their right to an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. Under Section 2, the \nhomogeneity of a community is never presumed whether the minority group is comprised of one \nor several racial minorities. Instead, the Gingles prongs establish the cohesiveness of the minority \n  9 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 12 of 44 PageID# 2281\nDefendants’ reliance on Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421 (4th Cir. 2004), is also misplaced. \nThat inapposite case concerns “crossover” districts, not coalition claims. See Bartlett, 556 U.S. at \n13 (distinguishing between crossover claims and coalition claims and explaining why crossover \nclaims are analytically distinct and cannot be conflated with coalition claims). Defendants’ selec-\ntive reliance on abstract language from Hall’s discussion of crossover districts fails to support their \ninference that Hall also prohibits coalition districts. Defs. Br. at at 11–13. The Fourth Circuit in \nHall concluded only that “[a] coalition of black and white voters can certainly join forces to elect \na candidate, but Section 2 does not create an entitlement for minorities to form an alliance with \nother voters in a district who do not share the same statutory disability as the protected class.” 385 \nF.3d at 431 n.13 (emphasis added). That conclusion does not preclude a claim by an alliance of \nminority voters who do share the “statutory disability” of Section 2—i.e., a shared experience of \ndiscrimination. This distinction makes sense because the VRA specifically contemplates relief for \nsubjugated minorities who are not receiving significant political support from the white majority. \nSee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50. \n  Finally, Defendants’ proposed approach—which demands racial homogeneity among mi-\nnority voters in order to benefit from the VRA’s protections against discrimination—is deeply \nproblematic. Indeed, as the dissent explained in Nixon, such a ruling that “voters historically denied \naccess to the political process, protected under the Voting Rights Act, and sharing identical inter-\nests must be ethnically classified and segregated from one another denigrates the spirit and the \nlanguage of the constitution.” 76 F.3d at 1399. The VRA is a remedial statute intended to protect \n \ncommunity and the cohesiveness of a white majority voting bloc in opposition. Plaintiffs seek only \nthe same opportunity to prove their claim that any other plaintiff would have. \n  10 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 13 of 44 PageID# 2282\nminority voters from historical discrimination; it should not be used to balkanize minority com-\nmunities suffering under the same discriminatory conditions. The line-drawing that the Defend-\nants’ approach espouses is nearly impossible to cabin and lends itself to easy manipulation by \nDefendants who will seek to slice and dice racial categories, using the unique heterogeneity of our \ncommunities of color against them. See id. at 1401 (“If we are to make these distinctions, where \nwill they end? Must a community that would be considered racially both Black and Hispanic be \nsegregated from other Blacks who are not Hispanic? Should the dwindling numbers of Native \nAmericans be further decimated by a parsing of Navaho from Apache? Must Puerto–Ricans and \nDominicans in the same neighborhood be separated based on their separate cultural and historical \nbackgrounds?”). The Court should decline to follow such a path.  \nB.  Hispanic, Black, and Asian Voters in Virginia Beach Are Politically Cohesive. \n \nContrary to Defendants’ assertions, evidence in the record demonstrates that Hispanic, \nBlack, and Asian (“HBA”) voters in Virginia Beach are politically cohesive. At minimum, this \nevidence raises a triable issue of fact as to the political cohesion of the minority communities in \nVirginia Beach. This evidence includes analysis of voting patterns in City Council elections (“en-\ndogenous” elections) performed by Plaintiffs’ experts Dr. Spencer and Dr. Lichtman, as well as \nunchallenged evidence showing political cohesion among HBA voters in federal elections (“exog-\nenous” elections), and reconstituted election results in Plaintiffs’ Illustrative Plan’s two majority-\nHBA districts. Moreover, Defendants misinterpret Dr. Spencer’s report and improperly narrow the \nscope of evidence relevant to the cohesion inquiry. Alongside Plaintiffs’ statistical evidence of \npolitical cohesion among HBA voters, qualitative evidence such as the combined efforts of HBA \nvoters on core political issues and the City Council’s own treatment of the HBA population as a \n  11 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 14 of 44 PageID# 2283\ngroup during redistricting provides additional proof of cohesion among HBA voters in Virginia \nBeach.  \n1.  Elections in Virginia Beach Demonstrate Significant Levels of Racially Polar-\nized Voting and Cohesion Between Hispanic, Black, and Asian Voters \n \ni.  City Council Elections in Virginia Beach Are Marked by Racially Po-\nlarized Voting Between Minority Voters and White Voters. \n \nDr. Spencer’s initial report analyzed minority political cohesion and white bloc voting in \nVirginia Beach. He first performed a precinct-level assessment to “infer the voting behavior of \ndemographic subgroups,” in every City Council election from 2008-2018 that featured a nonwhite \ncandidate. Defs. Ex. 4 at 4.5 This assessment used the widely accepted and well-established statis-\ntical measures of homogenous precinct analysis, ecological regression, and ecological inference. \nId. at 4-6.6 Using these methods, estimates of candidate preferences can be produced for individual \nracial groups or a combined minority group.  \nSince “the population of Hispanic and Asian voters [in Virginia Beach] is not large enough \nto generate precise estimates of candidate preference using [these] traditional statistical methods,” \nDefs. Ex. 5 at 6, Dr. Spencer estimated the candidate preferences of the combined minority voters \nin Virginia Beach. Dr. Spencer explained that this was “the most reliable method for interpreting \nthe candidate preferences of black, Hispanic, and Asian voters.” Id. Dr. Spencer reported these \n \n5 All nonwhite candidates for City Council between 2008-2018 were Black candidates. Defs. Ex. \n4 at 3. Dr. Spencer excluded three races featuring perennial candidate George Furman as non-\nprobative. George Furman, while African American, was not the candidate of choice of the minor-\nity community in any of those races. \n6 Courts routinely approve the use of these methods. See, e.g., Gingles, 478 U.S. at 52-53, n.20 \n(approving use of homogenous precincts and ecological regression); U.S. v. Charleston Cnty., 316 \nF. Supp. 2d 268, 303-04 (D.S.C. 2003), aff’d, 365 F.3d 341 (4th Cir. 2004) (finding Section 2 \nviolation where both sides’ experts used ecological regression and homogeneous precinct analy-\nsis); Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 336 F. Supp. 2d 976, 1003 (D.S.D. 2004), aff’d, 461 F.3d 1101 (8th \nCir. 2006) (approving use of ecological inference).  \n  12 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 15 of 44 PageID# 2284\nestimates on pages 12-31 of his initial report as the “All minority” category.7 Using these estimates, \nDr. Spencer found that of the 16 Black candidates who ran in probative elections from 2008-2018, \nten of them “were the candidates of choice for minority voters” and seven of those ten (70%) \n“faced strong opposition by white voters and were defeated by white bloc voting.” Defs. Ex. 4 at \n3.8 In addition, he found that “in 11 of 1[3] races, [there is] evidence that all minority voters share \nthe same strong preference for a candidate and vote as a coalition.” Id. at 11.9 Dr. Spencer found \nthat this was “strong evidence of racially polarized voting between minority and white voters in \nVirginia Beach elections.” Id. at 7. \nDefendants’ motion ignores the analysis of Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Lichtman, who also ex-\namined racially polarized voting in City Council elections as part of his initial report, rebuttal \nreport, and supplemental tables. Pls. Exs. 1, 2, and 3. In his initial report, Dr. Lichtman wrote: “For \ncity council elections studied from 2008 to 2018, blacks and all minorities typically preferred to \nvote for black candidates and whites typically preferred to vote for white candidates. White bloc \nvoting usually defeated city council candidates of choice of blacks and minorities.” Pls. Ex. 1 at \n21. He also noted that “no black candidate has ever won reelection to a city council position in \n \n7 Plaintiffs address Defendants’ flawed arguments regarding the reliability of Dr. Spencer’s com-\nbined estimate infra. \n8 Defendants’ expert Dr. Kidd disputes this finding, instead opining that only one candidate be-\ntween 2008-2018 experienced white bloc voting: Tanya Bullock in 2010. Pls. Ex. 5 at 76:6-11. \nThese are precisely the types of material factual disputes unsuitable to resolution at the summary \njudgment stage. \n9 These 11 races include the following: the 2018 Centerville seat; 2016 Kempsville seat; 2014 at-\nlarge and Rose Hall seat; 2012 Kempsville seat, 2011 at-large seat, 2010 at-large, Bayside, and \nPrincess Anne seats, and the 2008 at-large and Kempsville seats.

Pls. Ex. 2 at 2-10; Pls. \nEx. 3. In particular, Dr. Lichtman’s supplemental Table R3-A demonstrates that of the 10 minority \ncandidates of choice of HBA voters between 2008-2018, only three won their elections (30%). Id. \nSignificantly, two of the three successful Black candidates were elected in 2018, during the pen-\ndency of this lawsuit. The Supreme Court has specifically recognized that elections during the \npendency of VRA litigation constitute special circumstances making them less probative.11 If these \ntwo elections are discounted, only one of eight Black candidates of choice of minority voters was \nelected between 2008-2018. This disputed evidence, unmentioned in Defendants’ brief, precludes \nresolution of either Gingles prong 2 or 3 by a summary judgment motion. \nii.  Dr. Spencer’s “All Minority” Estimate is a Reliable Measurement of \nCohesion Between Hispanic, Black, and Asian Voters. \n \nAs explained above, given that the Hispanic and Asian “precinct-level populations are \nsimply too small to draw reliable conclusions about . . . independently,” Dr. Spencer estimated the \njoint preferences of Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters together. Defs. Ex. 5 at 6. This combined \nestimate provides a reliable measure of cohesion among minority voters in Virginia Beach.  Yet \nDefendants’ contention that combined estimates are not probative of cohesion among the minority \ncommunity raises a factual dispute, is unsupported by the case law and, at most, goes to the weight \n \n10 During the City’s 55-year history, only six African Americans have served on the City Council. \n“Of the 605 possible seats during that time (eleven seats x 55 years) less than 1% have been occu-\npied by an African American.” Defs. Ex. 4 at 3. To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, there have been no \nHispanic City Council members, and only one Asian City Council member (Ron Villanueva). See, \ne.g., Pls. Ex. 7 (Moss Dep) at 111:5-10. \n11 The special circumstances doctrine is discussed further in Subsection I.C.1 of the brief. \n  14 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 17 of 44 PageID# 2286\nthis Court should give to the combined estimates at trial once all evidence is presented. Where, as \nhere, the evidence “sets up a battle of the experts,” the case “should not be resolved at summary \njudgment.” Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cnty., Md., 789 F.3d 407, 417 (4th Cir. 2015).  \nCombined estimates of minority voting are properly used as evidence of inter-minority \ncohesion. See, e.g., Campos, 840 F.2d at 1247 (upholding finding of cohesion based on “statistical \nevidence of the voting pattern of the combined minority,” where the district court properly declined \nto credit defendant’s attempt at single-race estimates); Rodriguez v. Pataki, 308 F. Supp. 2d 346, \n421 (S.D.N.Y. 2004), aff’d mem., 543 U.S. 997 (2004) (faulting plaintiffs’ expert for failing to use \na combined estimate of Black and Hispanic voting to analyze cohesion). In addition, given the \nrelatively small Hispanic and Asian population in Virginia Beach, a combined estimate is the best \navailable data for assessing levels of minority political cohesion. Defs. Ex. 5 at 6-7. Under these \ncircumstances, using combined estimates to show cohesion allows this court to avoid “mechani-\ncally” applying the Gingles preconditions “without regard to the claim.” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 \nU.S. 146, 158 (1993). \nContrary to Defendants’ arguments, there is nothing “deceptive” about Dr. Spencer’s com-\nbined estimate of minority candidate preferences, nor does it “presume” cohesion. Defs. Br. at 16. \nDr. Spencer’s “All Minority” estimate is exactly what Plaintiffs’ experts say it is: an estimate of \nthe preferences of Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters together. And, as Dr. Spencer noted, “Black, \nHispanic, and Asian voters combined generate estimates that are statistically significantly different \nfrom white voting, which then makes a comparison between these groups possible.” Defs. Ex. 5 \nat 6. Dr. Spencer’s analysis also shows that the “All minority” estimates correlate strongly with \nthe independently reported “Black” estimates of candidate preference. The 2016 race between \n  15 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 18 of 44 PageID# 2287\nBlack female candidate Amelia Ross-Hammond and white female candidate Jessica Abbott is il-\nlustrative. Defs. Ex. 4 at 16. In this race, Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters together strongly pre-\nferred Ross-Hammond over Abbott, while white voters strongly supported Abbott, leading to \nRoss-Hammond’s defeat. Id. \nDefendants’ arguments simply reflect a flawed understanding of how statistical estimates \nof voter preference work. For example, Defendants focus only on the ecological inference esti-\nmate, but that is improper when assessing cohesion. Dr. Spencer testified that it generally is best \nto “look for a pattern of support that is confirmed by all three methods.” Defs. Ex. 6 at 91:7-\n12. Thus, while Defendants focus on one estimate alone for the Ross-Hammond and Abbott \nrace, what all three estimates show is a statistically significant difference between the high all \nminority support and the low white support for Ross-Hammond. Defs. Ex. 4 at 15. This corre-\nsponds with a statistically significant difference between the high Black support and low white \nsupport for Ross-Hammond. Id.  In addition, the homogenous precinct estimates for Black and All \nminority support for Ross-Hammond are virtually identical (at 62.3 versus 62.1), showing no \nmeaningful difference between the preferences of the two groups. Id. at 15-16. \nFor similar reasons, Defendants’ “Jack & Jill” example is not persuasive. As shown above, \nDr. Spencer’s combined estimates using three different statistical methods, along with the individ-\nual “Black support” estimate, provide much more information about voter preferences than the \nDefendants’ simple hypothetical based on a single measurement. And, as discussed below, Dr. \nSpencer’s analysis of exogenous elections and reconstituted election results also show that His-\npanic, Black, and Asian voters vote together, otherwise they would not be able to elect their can-\ndidates of choice in Plaintiffs’ illustrative districts. Defs. Ex. 4 at 31-32. This is additional evidence \nthat the combined estimate is not “masking” differences between racial groups.  \n  16 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 19 of 44 PageID# 2288\nDefendants’ flawed understanding of the complex statistical evidence in this case is likely \ninformed by their chosen expert, who lacks the necessary qualifications to assess the evidence. Dr. \nKidd has never analyzed racially polarized voting, either personally or professionally. Pls. Ex. 5 \nat 39:2-18. He has never published any peer-reviewed articles on conducting a racially polarized \nvoting analysis and he has no expertise on the methodology for doing so. Id. at 37:16-38:13. He \ndid not attempt to calculate his own homogenous precinct, ecological regression, or ecological \ninference estimates, id. at 52:1-9, and he did not even open the file Dr. Spencer produced contain-\ning his estimates. Id. at 53:6-18. When Dr. Kidd actually engages with Dr. Spencer’s analysis, he \nincorrectly applies a 50% threshold for candidates of choice in every election, a standard which \nmakes no sense given the high number of multi-candidate races in Virginia Beach. See, e.g., Pls. \nEx. 5 at 78:1-12; Defs. Ex. 5 at 5-6, n. 2. Dr. Kidd’s 50% threshold is patently improper. See, e.g., \nDefs. Ex. 5 at 4-6; Pls. Ex. 2 at 3, 6. As Dr. Lichtman’s rebuttal report indicates, Dr. Kidd’s report \nis filled with omissions, errors, and inconsistencies. See, e.g., Pls. Ex. 2 at 10, 12, 15-40.  \nFinally, Dr. Kidd’s primary critique of Dr. Spencer’s combined estimate is an analysis that \nrelies in part on different levels of turnout between Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters in Virginia. \nPls. Ex. 8 at 19-20. Dr. Kidd writes “we know that Asian and Hispanic voters do not turn out at \nthe same rate as African American voters . . . The average African American turnout [in Virginia] \nduring these election years is 54.3%. Asian average turnout lags that by 6.9% and Hispanic average \nturnout lags it by 9.9%.” Id. However, courts have repeatedly discounted analyses that rely on \nturnout rates to disprove a Section 2 claim, and to the extent Dr. Kidd’s analysis relies on differ-\nential turnout rates, this Court should discount it as well. See, e.g., Montes v. City of Yakima, 40 F. \nSupp. 3d 1377, 1405 (E.D. Wash. 2014) (“[T]he Ninth Circuit has prohibited district courts from \ndiscounting statistics about a minority group’s candidate preferences on the basis of low voter \n  17 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 20 of 44 PageID# 2289\nturnout”); Gomez v. City of Watsonville, 863 F.2d 1407, 1416 (9th Cir. 1988) (“The district court \nerred by focusing on low minority voter registration and turnout as evidence that the minority \ngroup was not politically cohesive.”).12  \nThe parties’ disagreements over the reliability of a combined minority estimate to show \npolitical cohesion demonstrate genuine disputes of material facts. This classic “battle of the ex-\nperts” precludes summary judgment. See, e.g., LifeNet Health v. LifeCell Corp., 2014 WL 5456521 \nat *12 (E.D. Va. Oct. 27, 2014) (holding summary judgment is inappropriate where parties dispute \n“‘the credibility and weight that should be afforded to conflicting expert reports’”).  \niii.  Defendants Ignore Significant Yet Undisputed Record Evidence from \nPlaintiffs’ Experts Showing Cohesion Among HBA Voters \n \nIn addition to the statistical evidence from Dr. Spencer and Dr. Lichtman showing political \ncohesion in endogenous elections, Dr. Spencer also offers two other categories of statistical evi-\ndence that are undisputed in this case: analysis of voting patterns in exogenous federal elections \nand reconstituted election results in Plaintiffs’ Illustrative Plan’s majority-HBA districts.13 This \npowerful and unchallenged evidence of cohesion among HBA voters in Virginia Beach is addi-\ntional proof that genuine issues of material fact regarding cohesion remain.  \nDr. Spencer’s initial report, Defs. Ex. 4, provides analysis of racially polarized voting in \nfour federal elections with precincts in Virginia Beach, including the 2008 and 2012 Presidential \nelections, the 2008 Presidential primary, and the 2016 Congressional election, all of which featured \n \n12 In addition, Dr. Kidd’s analysis relies on turnout estimates for Virginia as a whole, not Virginia \nBeach. Pls. Ex. 8 at 19-20. He also did not calculate margins of error for the estimates in this table, \neven though he could have. Pls. Ex. 5 at 109:13-110:3. \n13 Defendants’ experts did not mention and offered no opinions whatsoever in their expert reports, \ndeposition testimony, or Defendants’ Motion regarding Dr. Spencer’s analysis of racially polarized \nvoting in federal elections or his analysis of reconstituted elections in Plaintiffs’ Illustrative Plan \ndistricts.  \n  18 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 21 of 44 PageID# 2290\na Black candidate challenging a white candidate. Id. at 30-31. All four of these elections show \nsignificant levels of racially polarized voting in Virginia Beach. As Dr. Spencer found, in the 2008 \nand 2012 Presidential elections, “Minority voters strongly preferred Obama over both John \nMcCain and Mitt Romney, with an estimated 90% support. White voters strongly preferred \nMcCain and Romney (65% support) over Obama (35% support).” Id. at 30, Fig. 12. The 2008 \nprimary results, which show “much stronger” support for Obama “among minority voters,” also \ndemonstrate that “even controlling for party label there is evidence of racially polarized voting in \nVirginia Beach.” Id. at Fig. 13. Finally, the 2016 Congressional election between Black female \ncandidate Shaun Brown and white male candidate Scott Taylor “provides evidence of racial coa-\nlitional voting, minority cohesion, and oppositional white bloc voting” in Virginia Beach. Id. at \n31, Fig. 14. Despite being the clear candidate of choice for HBA voters, “Brown earned just 36.6% \nof the city’s overall votes compared to 63.3% for Taylor.” Id.14 \nCourts considering Section 2 claims, including in the Fourth Circuit, have repeatedly held \nthat exogenous elections are probative of whether minority voters are politically cohesive. See, \ne.g., Cane v. Worcester Cnty., Md., 840 F. Supp. 1081, 1088 (D. Md. 1994) (explaining that “plain-\ntiffs may rely on factors beyond endogenous election data that prove political cohesion,” including \nexogenous elections) (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57, n. 25; Hall v. Holder, 955 F.2d 1563, 1571 \n(11th Cir. 1992)), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, Cane v. Worcester Cnty., Md., 35 \n \n14 Dr. Lichtman also analyzed these exogenous elections, concluding in his initial report that Dr. \nSpencer “found a pattern of substantial racially polarized voting in these four federal elections. In \n3 of 4 elections, white bloc voting defeated the candidate of choice of black and minority voters \nwithin the precincts of Virginia Beach.” Pls. Ex. 1 at 21. In his rebuttal report, Dr. Lichtman further \nstated that “this polarization applied to all minority voters. In all four elections, the minority sup-\nport for black candidates averaged about 90 percent or more, showing an extreme degree of cohe-\nsion.” Pls. Ex. 1 at 2-3. \n \n  19 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 22 of 44 PageID# 2291\nF.3d 921 (4th Cir. 1994); Jenkins v. Red Clay Consolidated Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 4 F.3d 1103, \n1134-35 (3rd Cir. 1993) (holding that exogenous elections could be considered in racially polar-\nized voting analysis); Citizens for a Better Gretna v. City of Gretna, La., 834 F.2d 496, 502 (5th \nCir. 1987) (“[T]he district court properly considered [exogenous elections] as additional evidence \nof bloc voting—particularly in light of the sparsity of available data.”). This authority leaves no \ndoubt that exogenous election results are relevant in assessing political cohesion. Here, the results \nunequivocally demonstrate political cohesion among HBA voters. \nDr. Spencer also offered uncontested analyses of reconstituted election results in Plaintiffs’ \nIllustrative Plan’s majority-HBA districts. Defs. Ex. 4 at 32-34; Defs. Ex. 5 at 10, 16. Reconstituted \nelections analysis “merg[es] voting data from previous elections to the boundaries of each new \ndistrict[]” to determine whether minority candidates of choice could be elected if single-member \ndistricts replaced at-large elections. Defs. Ex. 4 at 32; see also Rodriguez v. Bexar Cnty., Tex., 385 \nF.3d 853, 861 (5th Cir. 2004) (defining reconstituted elections analysis). As Dr. Lichtman testified \nat his deposition, “other evidence [to prove political cohesion] would be whether or not the minor-\nity candidates could win in illustrative districts drawn without a majority of one group but a com-\nbined majority. That would be—you know, we’d call that reconstituted elections, and that’s a sec-\nond powerful test.” Defs. Ex. 8 at 121:12-122:1; see, e.g., Johnson v. Miller, 864 F. Supp. 1354, \n1391 (S.D. Ga. 1994) (per curiam) (“Statistically speaking, reconstituted election results from pre-\ncincts within a certain district, actual prior election results from a certain district, and frequency \ndistributions are the primary methods used to estimate the percentages needed to give [minority] \nvoters an equal opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.”) aff'd Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. \n900 (1995); Hall v. Louisiana, 108 F. Supp. 3d 419, 436 (M.D. La. 2015) (“[R]econstituted elec-\n  20 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 23 of 44 PageID# 2292\ntions are valuable in demonstrating voting patterns within the relevant electorate, to elucidate vot-\ning patterns within the jurisdiction when voters have an opportunity to vote for [a minority] can-\ndidate.”).  \nDr. Spencer performed this “second powerful test” in both of his expert reports, and his \nfindings demonstrate significant political cohesion among HBA voters in Virginia Beach. This \nanalysis makes sense intuitively. If HBA voters do not vote together in elections, they would not \nbe able to regularly elect candidates of choice in Plaintiffs’ illustrative districts containing 50.03% \nand 50.04% HBA CVAP. Defs. Ex. 1 at 20.15 \nIn his initial report, Dr. Spencer performed a reconstituted elections analysis for seven City \nCouncil races between 2008 and 2016. Defs. Ex. 4 at 33. Table 6 of the report shows that of those \nseven races in the reconstituted elections analysis, 4 of 7 minority preferred candidates would win \nelection in District 1 (compared to 0 of 7 under the at-large system), and 5 of 7 minority preferred \ncandidates would win election in District 2 (compared to 0 of 7 under the current at-large system). \nId. at 34. This marked improvement is critical evidence of political cohesion among HBA voters.  \nDr. Spencer’s rebuttal report added an analysis of the 2018 City Council election results in \nthe Plaintiffs’ Illustrative Plan’s districts. Defs. Ex. 5 at 10, 16. Under this analysis, Black candi-\ndate Aaron Rouse would still be elected under Illustrative Districts 1 and 2. Id. at 16. In addition, \n“minority [voters] preferred Dee Oliver over the incumbent John Moss by a three-to-one margin, \nyet Moss won re-election [in 2018]” under the at-large system. But, in Illustrative Districts 1 and \n2, “Ms. Oliver would have won a seat on the City Council instead.” Id. This analysis again presents \n \n15 Including mixed race individuals (those who identify as black and white), District 1 has a 51.11% \nHispanic, Black, and Asian Citizen Voting Age Population (“HBA CVAP”), and District two has \na 51.08% HBA CVAP. Defs. Ex. 1 at 21. \n  21 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 24 of 44 PageID# 2293\nsignificant, uncontested evidence of cohesion among HBA voters in endogenous elections. De-\nfendants thus cannot credibly argue that the question of whether political cohesion among minority \nvoters exists is undisputed. At a minimum, it is a material fact in dispute. \n2.  Plaintiffs Have Also Produced Qualitative Evidence That Is Probative of Co-\nhesion Among Hispanic, Black, and Asian Voters \n \nQualitative evidence may also be used to demonstrate cohesion. Brewer v. Ham, which \nDefendants cite, makes clear that “statistical evidence is not a sine qua non to establishing cohe-\nsion.” 876 F.2d 448, 454 (5th Cir. 1989). Rather, under Gingles, “[c]ourts may look to [non-sta-\ntistical] evidence to demonstrate political cohesiveness, since ‘[t]he experiences and observations \nof individuals involved in the political process are clearly relevant to the question of whether the \nminority group is politically cohesive.’” Luna v. Cnty. of Kern, 291 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1125 (E.D. \nCal. 2018) (quoting Sanchez v. Bond, 875 F.2d 1488, 1494 (10th Cir. 1989)).  \nDefendants wrongly contend that the statistical evidence presented fails to be probative for \nAsian-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. But even if that were true—it is not—Plaintiffs’ \nclaims need not hinge on statistical evidence alone. In Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Representation \nv. City of Bridgeport, for example, the statistical evidence was stronger for one of the groups in \nthe coalition but lacking for the other, but the court found sufficient evidence of cohesiveness by \nsupplementing the statistical evidence with qualitative evidence from the community. 26 F.3d 271, \n276 (2d Cir. 1994), vacated on other grounds, City of Bridgeport, Conn. v. Bridgeport Coal. for \nFair Representation, 512 U.S. 1283(1994). Even in the absence of any statistical evidence, a court \ncould still find that cohesiveness has been sufficiently demonstrated by qualitative evidence of \npolitical cohesiveness. See Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass’n. v. Cnty. of Albany, \n2003 WL 21524820 at *8-9 (N.D.N.Y. 2003).  \n  22 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 25 of 44 PageID# 2294\nThis makes sense. Where the statistics may be stymied by limitations of the data, local \nleaders often understand the political dynamics of their communities quite well. Here, the record \nreflects four primary types of qualitative evidence in addition to the statistical evidence: evidence \nof the city treating the HBA communities as one group, evidence of elected officials treating the \nHBA communities as one group, evidence of shared interests of the HBA communities, and evi-\ndence of the HBA communities working together as a unified coalition. This evidence is consistent \nwith the types of qualitative evidence other courts have relied upon in assessing cohesiveness. \nDefendants ignore this qualitative evidence entirely. Below is a non-exhaustive description of the \nqualitative evidence currently in the record. This evidence, like the statistical evidence, plainly \ndemonstrates a serious dispute as to the material fact of political cohesion.  \nFirst, the record demonstrates that the Virginia Beach city government frequently regards \nthe HBA community as one cohesive group. In 2011, for example, the city touted the City Coun-\ncil’s attempt to create a majority-minority district (albeit one that only dictates the residence of the \ncandidate, not the voters that may cast ballots in that district). Pls. Ex. 9.16 That district, the Cen-\nterville District, is comprised of Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters. Pls. Ex. 10; Pls. Ex. 11 at 39:2-\n16.17 Plainly, the city saw those minority groups as a cohesive group such that the creation of a \ndistrict in which there was an HBA majority would satisfy those communities. Councilman Dyer \nspecifically explained that his and the Council’s motivation behind the creation of the district was \n“to see equal representation.” Pls Ex. 11 at 39: 2–16.18 Additionally, the Virginia Beach Minority \n \n16 All exhibits obtained from Defendants and in response to subpoenas are authenticated by the \ndeclaration of Simone Leeper. See Pls. Ex. 37. \n17 In fact, the Centerville District is just shy of being a majority-minority district with 45.91% \nHBA CVAP. Defs. Ex. 1 at 69. \n18 Similar evidence has been used to demonstrate cohesiveness in other cases. See, e.g., Arbor Hill \nConcerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass’n, 2003 WL 21524820 at *9 (considering consent decree \n  23 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 26 of 44 PageID# 2295\nBusiness Council (MBC) works to support “minority business owners” without limiting that sup-\nport to any particular group. Pls. Ex. 17 at 107:2-9 (describing the purpose of the MBC). Members \nof the MBC reflect the true diversity of Virginia Beach rather than just coming from one specific \nracial group. Pls. Ex. 33.19 \nSecond, Virginia Beach City Council members treat the HBA community as a cohesive \ncommunity. For example, City Council members Aaron Rouse and Rosemary Wilson speak about \nminorities in Virginia Beach as a group with group-specific needs and priorities. See, e.g., Pls. Ex. \n17 at 48:13-19 (Councilman Rouse discussing his platform goal about increasing minority partic-\nipation to level the playing field economically); Pls. Ex. 32 at 170:4 (Councilwoman Wilson dis-\ncussing the hiring of minority police officers and saying “we really love having minorities”). Other \ncourts have considered the impressions of elected officials based on their “observations of past \ncity elections and personal contacts with minority citizens.” Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Represen-\ntation v. City of Bridgeport, 26 F.3d 271, 276 (2d Cir. 1994).  \nThird, there is substantial evidence that the HBA communities have shared interests in \nVirginia Beach. This type of evidence is appropriate because, when assessing cohesiveness, courts \nmay consider evidence that the minority coalition has shared concerns that are different than those \nof the majority community. Luna v. Cnty. of Kern, 291 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1126 (E.D. Cal. 2018). \n \ncreating a majority-minority district comprised of both black and Hispanic communities to resolve \na VRA claim Act as an admission that the county considered the groups to be politically cohesive). \n19 Virginia Beach has indicated in other ways that it considers the HBA community to be a cohesive \ngroup.  For example, in multiple Virginia Beach Equal Employment Opportunity Plans, the greater \ncategory of “minorities” has been included before parsing it out into subcategories. See, e.g., Pls. \nEx. 12 at DEF 11629, Pls. Ex. 13 at DEF 11878, Pls. Ex. 14 at DEF 11940, and Pls. Ex. 15 at DEF \n11554-11555. And the City of Virginia Beach Department of Housing and Neighborhood Preser-\nvation identified “minorities” writ large as a target of their outreach without disaggregating by \nrace. Pls. Ex. 16 at DEF 10610-10613. \n \n  24 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 27 of 44 PageID# 2296\nCouncilman Rouse specifically identified the shared interests of the minority community in Vir-\nginia Beach as such unique concerns in speaking about why there was a lack of minority represen-\ntation on City Council and why that matters. Councilman Rouse testified that “what may particu-\nlarly have been an issue for the minority population may be overlooked by the majority.” See Pls. \nEx. 17 at 89:18–20. Councilwoman Abbott identified what some of those minority-specific issues \nwere when she testified that the two issues she had spoken about with minority community mem-\nbers most frequently were (1) district voting and (2) the minority community’s desire for a dispar-\nity study. Pls. Ex. 18 at 136:15-137:12. Regarding district voting, Plaintiff Latasha Holloway tes-\ntified that she believes “all black and brown individuals” including Hispanic, Black, and Asian \npersons are affected by breakdowns resulting from a deficit of representation. Pls. Ex. 19 at 53:13-\n54:10. Councilwoman Abbott echoed this sentiment when she provided documentation in response \nto her subpoena that reflected her support for a district system of election because of “systemic \nracial disparities” that result from at large systems. Pls. Ex. 20 at 17. \nFinally, there is evidence that the HBA communities have acted as a unified coalition in \nVirginia Beach. In a 2001 redistricting effort, the HBA coalition united under a single name, \n“Community Coalition for a Better Virginia Beach,” to advocate for single-member districts. This \neffort is reflected both in a transcript from a public hearing that was held on the redistricting effort \nand in Plaintiff Georgia Allen’s declaration. Pls. Ex. 21; Pls. Ex. 22 at 2. In 2003, the HBA coali-\ntion united to protest the Virginia Beach city treasurer on two separate occasions after he made \nderogatory remarks to the African-American and Asian-American communities. Pls. Ex. 22 at 3. \nThese and other examples demonstrate a united HBA coalition probative of cohesiveness. See \n  25 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 28 of 44 PageID# 2297\nArbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass’n., 2003 WL 21524820 at *9 (considering evi-\ndence of past instances when minority groups “jointly participated in and supported various events \nand projects of interest to one or the other group”). \nThe record includes all four types of qualitative evidence regarding the 2018 disparity study \nconducted by Virginia Beach. First, the disparity study and the underlying disparate result were of \nconsiderable interest to the minority community as a whole, not simply African-Americans. Pls. \nEx. 23 at DEF07724-07725 (“Many small businesses led by people of all races are not getting a \nfair shake at city contracts.”) (“This is a conversation that has been going on in a lot of communi-\nties—and not just the African American community—for decades.”); Pls. Ex. 24 at DEF0790–\n07791 (reporting that “businesses owned by Native Americans, Hispanics and African Americans” \nwere underutilized). Second, the disparity study was only undertaken after persistent public agita-\ntion from a diverse coalition of the minority community. Pls. Ex. 23 at DEF 07725 07725 (“Facing \nbacklash from community, Virginia Beach agrees to study whether enough city contracts given to \nminorities.”); Pls. Ex. 28 at DEF 07750 (“The 2017 faith march drew blacks, but also whites and \nLatinos.”). Third, city council members recognized that the study was a priority for the minority \ncommunity at large. Pls. Ex. 25 (Councilwoman Wooten specifically inviting Hispanic, Filipino, \nand Asian-American community groups to an event addressing the disparity study); Pls. Ex. 18 at \n136:15-137:12 (Councilwoman Abbott identifying the desire for a disparity study as one of the \nmost common topics with the minority community). And finally, the disparity study itself dis-\ncusses “minority-owned businesses,” which is defined to include businesses owned by people \nidentifying as Black, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American. Pls. Ex. 29 at DEF 08945.   \n  Defendants dismiss this important qualitative evidence, which bolsters Plaintiffs’ claims \nof minority cohesion. Plaintiffs provided a lengthy and diverse list of witnesses who can testify to \n  26 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 29 of 44 PageID# 2298\nthe minority community’s longstanding efforts to work together to overcome racial discrimination. \nPls. Exs. 30-31. Defendants chose not to depose any of them. The evidence in the record demon-\nstrates that the city and City Council members treat the HBA community as cohesive, that the \nHBA communities share common interests not shared by the majority, and that the HBA commu-\nnities have historically worked as a united coalition. This qualitative evidence corroborates the \nstatistical evidence provided by Plaintiffs that the HBA communities in Virginia Beach are cohe-\nsive. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Evidence Satisfies the Gingles Requirement of White Bloc Voting \n \nThe third Gingles precondition asks whether “the white majority votes sufficiently as a \nbloc to enable it – in the absence of special circumstances . . . – to defeat the minority’s preferred \ncandidate.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51. In making this determination, “the court must first identify \nthose  individuals  who  constitute  minority-preferred  candidates  of  choice,  and  then  analyze \nwhether those candidates are usually defeated by majority White bloc voting.” Levy v. Lexington \nCnty., S.C., 589 F.3d 708, 716 (4th Cir. 2009). After factoring in the special circumstances of the \n2018 elections, the white majority in Virginia Beach has usually defeated minority-preferred can-\ndidates. Further, even if the special circumstances did not exist, minority candidates usually lose \ndue to white bloc voting.  \n1.  The 2018 City Council Elections Are Special Circumstances That Should be Dis-\ncounted  \n \nDefendants’ argument on Gingles prong 3 is largely premised on the success of Aaron \nRouse and Sabrina Wooten in the 2018 elections. But a single election cannot outweigh decades \nof white majority bloc voting defeating minority candidates of choice. N.C. State Conference of \nNAACP v. McCrory, 831 F.3d 204, 232 (4th Cir. 2016) (“First, as the Supreme Court has ex-\nplained, courts should not place much evidentiary weight on any one election.”). Prior to 2018, in \n  27 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 30 of 44 PageID# 2299\nits entire history Virginia Beach had only elected three Black city councilmembers, one Asian city \ncouncilmember, and zero Hispanic city councilmembers. Defs. Ex. 4 at 7; Pls. Ex. 7 at 111:5-10. \nLikewise, only one minority candidate has ever been elected to any of the city’s five constitutional \noffices, all of which are elected citywide. Pls Ex. 1 at 43. No Black city councilmember has ever \nwon re-election, despite the natural incumbency advantage of current members. Pls. Ex. 1 at 21. \nThat is not the type of “sustained success” of minority candidates of choice that can defeat a Sec-\ntion 2 challenge. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 77 (emphasis added). \nMoreover, Defendants fail to recognize the well-established doctrine of “special circum-\nstances,” under which courts steeply discount the probative value of elections taking place during \nthe pendency of VRA litigation, such as the 2018 elections here. Under Gingles, Plaintiffs must \n“demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it—in the absence of \nspecial circumstances . . . —usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” 478 U.S. at 51 \n(emphasis added). One of those special circumstances, recognized in Gingles, is when the elections \nrelied upon occurred during the pendency of litigation, which could “work[] a one-time advantage \nfor black candidates in the form of unusual organized political support by white leaders concerned \nto forestall single-member districting.” Id. at 76 (citation omitted). \nIndeed, elections held during the pendency of litigation is the prototypical “special circum-\nstance” that makes an election less than probative. Even absent a “conspiracy or an intent to moot \nthis litigation,” the Fourth Circuit has held that elections during the pendency of litigation can be \nsuspect. Collins v. City of Norfolk, 816 F.2d 932, 938 (4th Cir. 1987). Like here, in Collins, the \ncity elected two Black councilpersons simultaneously for the first time in its history. Id. The Fourth \nCircuit held that this raised a serious question of special circumstances and remanded the matter \nto the district court. Id.at 937-38. On further appeal, the Fourth Circuit found that “prior to the \n  28 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 31 of 44 PageID# 2300\nspecial circumstances of 1984, white voters were able to defeat the combined strength of black \nvoters and white crossover votes, denying the black community a second seat on the council” and \nheld that “the election of a second black councilman in 1984 was the result of special circum-\nstances” and could not be determinative. Collins v. City of Norfolk, 883 F.2d 1232, 1242 (4th Cir. \n1989); see also Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1132 (“Prior to the commencement of this lawsuit, only a single \nblack had been elected to the Red Clay School Board. Although Scotton’s victory in the 1990 \nelection was not shown to have been caused by the pendency of the lawsuit . . . the minority suc-\ncesses in 1990 and 1991 are sufficiently recent and, potentially, transitory to limit their probative \nvalue.”).  \nThe 2018 elections of Councilmembers Rouse and Wooten meet all the indicia of special \ncircumstances. Councilwoman Wooten is the only minority candidate in the record who has ever \nreceived a majority of white support. Indeed, “the 51% of white voters who supported her is more \nthan three times the average support for the minority candidates during” the time period studied \nby Dr. Spencer. Defs. Ex. 4 at 12; see also Defs. Ex. 6 at 83:8-21. Likewise, the white support for \nCouncilman Rouse far exceeded ordinary white support for minority candidates. See Pls. Ex. 1 at \n44 (“[W]hite support for Rouse’s candidacy was 15.4 percentage points and 179 percent higher \nthan the average white support of 8.6 percent for the 5 other black candidates.”). Both Coun-\ncilmembers Wooten and Rouse also received unusual levels of financial support from wealthy \nwhite donors in Virginia Beach as compared to the ordinary minority candidate for city council. \nSee Pls. Ex. 1 at 47-57.  \nCouncil members Rouse and Wooten also received unusual support from white incumbent \ncity councilmembers. Councilwoman Rosemary Wilson affirmatively reached out to Ms. Wooten \nto support her campaign. Councilwoman Wilson not only endorsed Ms. Wooten but also donated \n  29 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 32 of 44 PageID# 2301\nto her campaign, introduced Ms. Wooten to many of her top donors and helped her solicit those \ndonations, attended her events, and lent her other support and advice.

He was also \nendorsed by the Governor of Virginia and U.S. Senator Warner, both very rare for a local city \ncouncil election. Id. at 41:10-17. The minority community should not be limited to electing candi-\ndates of choice who are famous football players with statewide endorsements and unusual white \ndonor and voter support.  \n2.  Even If the 2018 City Council Elections Are Not Special Circumstances, Minority- \nPreferred Candidates in Virginia Beach Usually Lose  \n \nWhether or not the 2018 City Council elections are discounted, Plaintiffs have presented \nsufficient evidence to satisfy Gingles prong 3. To determine whether white bloc voting usually \ndefeats minority candidates of choice, the Court must determine which elections to analyze. See \nGingles, 478 U.S. at 57 n. 25. Not all elections are equally probative. “Endogenous and interracial \nelections are the best indicators of whether the white majority usually defeats the minority candi-\ndate.” Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 461 F.3d 1011, 1020-21 (8th Cir. 2006); see also Old Person v. \n  30 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 33 of 44 PageID# 2302\nCooney, 230 F.3d 1113, 1123–24 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Elections between white and minority candi-\ndates are the most probative in determining the existence of legally sufficient white bloc voting.”). \nHowever, the Court “must consider, at a minimum, a representative cross-section of elections, and \nnot merely those in which a minority candidate appeared on the ballot, at least where elections in \nwhich minorities were on the ballot do not constitute a substantial majority of the total number of \nelections.” Lewis v. Alamance Cnty., N.C., 99 F.3d 600, 608 (4th Cir. 1996). \n  In Virginia Beach, between 2008 and 2018 there were 27 total City Council elections. Sev-\nenteen of these elections – approximately 63 percent – included a minority candidate. That 63 \npercent constitutes a “substantial majority” and a “representative cross-section” of the endogenous \nelections is not in dispute in this case. \ni.  In Probative Elections, Minority-Preferred Candidates Usually Lose \nDue to White Bloc Voting. \n \nDefendants argument that Gingles prong 3 is not met is contrary to the evidence. Indeed, \nboth Dr. Spencer and Defendants’ own expert conclude that white bloc voting usually leads to the \ndefeat of minority-preferred candidates.  \n  In his initial report, Dr. Spencer found 17 City Council elections between 2008 and 2018 \nto be probative. In 10 of those elections, Dr. Spencer identified a minority-preferred candidate. \nUnsurprisingly, of the 10 candidates, only three won their elections, and two of the three (Mr. \nRouse and Ms. Wooten) were elected in 2018 during the pendency of this lawsuit. Dr. Spencer \nreached this conclusion by running three iterations of racially polarized voting analysis: homoge-\nnous precinct, ecological regression, and ecological inference. All three reached the same conclu-\nsion: minority-preferred candidates in Virginia Beach usually lose elections due to white bloc vot-\ning. Defs. Ex. 4 at 4-7. \n  31 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 34 of 44 PageID# 2303\n  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Quentin Kidd, also reached a similar conclusion despite imposing \nartificial limitations on the analysis. Dr. Kidd, who provided no data of his own, used an improper \nthreshold of 50% minority support in every election no matter how many candidates, and who \nignored the special circumstances in 2018, opined that when “white candidates who were the pre-\nferred candidates of minority voters are considered . . . the number of African American and mi-\nnority-preferred candidates who won their electoral contests is seven of 17, including six of seven \nsince 2012.”20 Pls. Ex. 8 at 3. That is, between 2008 and 2018, 10 out of 17 minority-preferred \ncandidates lost their elections. Thus, while Dr. Kidd’s analysis is unduly limited, he ultimately \nagrees with Dr. Spencer: minority-preferred candidates in Virginia Beach usually lose their elec-\ntions.  \n  In their motion, Defendants do not acknowledge, let alone refute, Dr. Spencer’s analysis \nof exogenous elections. “Although they are not as probative as endogenous elections, exogenous \nelections hold some probative value.” Bone Shirt, 461 F.3d at 1021. Dr. Spencer found racially \npolarized voting in two presidential elections, one presidential primary, and one congressional \nrace. Dr. Spencer also found that oppositional white bloc voting was sufficient to block the pre-\nferred candidates of minority voters for President (Obama in 2008 and 2012) and for Congress in \n2016 (between a black female candidate and a white male candidate). Although President Obama \nwent on to win Virginia’s electoral votes, he lost Virginia Beach to McCain and Romney, respec-\ntively. Defs. Ex. 4 at 30-31. Adding these candidates to the list of minority-preferred candidates in \nendogenous elections further bolsters Dr. Spencer’s and Dr. Kidd’s conclusion that minority-pre-\nferred candidates are usually defeated by white bloc voting.  \n \n20 Contrary to Dr. Kidd’s assumption, white-white contests are not entitled the same weight as \nelections involving a minority candidate. See Rural W. Tennessee African-Am. Affairs Council v. \nSundquist, 209 F.3d 835, 840 (6th Cir. 2000). \n  32 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 35 of 44 PageID# 2304\nii.  Disputes of Material Facts Preclude Summary Judgment on the \nThird Gingles Precondition \n \n  Even if the Court is not yet able to conclude that minority candidates of choice usually lose \nin Virginia Beach due to bloc voting by the white majority, genuine disputes of material fact pre-\nclude summary judgment concerning the third Gingles precondition.     \nThe parties dispute several factual claims underlying Dr. Spencer’s initial expert report. \nDr. Spencer opined that elections that included George Furman were not probative because he was \na serial candidate who was never the minority-preferred candidate. Defs. Ex. 4 at 7 n.7. In their \nmotion, Defendants “contend that the races involving George Furman are probative.” Defs. Br. at \n29. The probative weight (if any) of Furman’s elections is an issue for trial. \nSimilarly, Defendants argue that this Court should only review elections that occurred in \n2011 and later because of the decennial census, Defs. Br. at 29, but Plaintiffs disagree. Dr. Spen-\ncer’s reports focus on elections between 2008 and 2018, and Plaintiffs believe the full history of \nthe minority community’s struggles to elect candidates of their choice is relevant. The 2011 redis-\ntricting is a particularly arbitrary line to draw considering that all Councilmembers are elected at-\nlarge and it does not matter how the district lines are drawn.  \nLastly, Dr. Kidd believes that the threshold to determine minority-preferred candidates is \nwhether a candidate received over 50% of minority support. Pls. Ex. 5 at 78:9-12. Again, Plaintiffs \nand their experts disagree. The Fourth Circuit has held that candidates are not required to “achieve \na threshold of 50% in a multi-candidate election” to be considered a minority-preferred candidate. \nLewis, 99 F.3d at 613 n. 10. In multi-candidate elections, “[c]andidates who receive less than 50% \nof the minority vote, but who would have been elected had the election been held only among \n[minority] voters, are presumed also to be minority-preferred candidates, although an individual-\nized assessment should be made in order to confirm that such a candidate may appropriately be \n  33 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 36 of 44 PageID# 2305\nso considered.” Id. at 614 (emphasis added). This matter should proceed to trial so the Court can \nperform the necessary individualized assessments. \nII.  Defendants’ Attempts to Discredit Plaintiffs’ Evidence Are Misguided and Premature  \n \nA.  Plaintiffs Need Not Statistically Pinpoint Asian and Hispanic Voting Behavior  \n \nDr. Spencer has properly opined, based on robust statistical evidence, that HBA voters in \nVirginia Beach are politically cohesive. In response, Defendants complain that Dr. Spencer did \nnot produce reliable statistics that isolate the respective voting behaviors of Asians or Hispanics. \nDefs. Br. at 15-26. But Plaintiffs do not need to provide isolated point estimates of Hispanic and \nAsian voting behavior to win this case, let alone to survive summary judgment. \nLike any minority group, a multi-racial minority coalition must show that it is “politically \ncohesive” to win a vote dilution claim under Gingles. Campos, 840 F.2d at 1244 (citing Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 56). If the evidence establishes that “one part of the group cannot be expected to vote \nwith the other part[s], the combination is not cohesive.” Id. at 1245. But if “the minority group as \na whole” votes together for the minority candidate of choice, “then cohesion is shown.” Id.    \nDefendants apparently assume that because all coalition plaintiffs must show cohesion, \nthey all must prove it by the same means. Specifically, Defendants insist that cohesion cannot be \nproven without using statistical methods to calculate “isolated, reliable estimates” of the voting \npatterns of each individual racial group in the coalition. Defs. Br. at 26. That is wrong. The VRA \nrequires “a flexible approach” to evaluating evidence, so that minority voters are not “forced to \nsuffer a violation of their rights under the Act because of external circumstances that limit the \navailability of data.” Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1134 (citing, inter alia, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57 n.5). \nCourts have made clear that this flexible approach applies to the methods plaintiffs may \nuse to prove inter-racial cohesion. Determining whether minority groups are cohesive with each \n  34 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 37 of 44 PageID# 2306\nother requires “a diligent inquiry into the political dynamics of the particular community.” Brewer, \n876 F.2d at 453. In some cases, this diligent inquiry leads to separate, reliable statistics on how \neach racial group votes. But in other cases, it may be “impossible” or infeasible to produce isolated \nstatistics on each racial group’s voting. Campos, 840 F.2d at 1245.21    \nThis case perfectly illustrates why isolated single-race voting statistics cannot be a prereq-\nuisite for proving cohesion. Plaintiffs have performed a “diligent inquiry,” Brewer, 876 F.2d at \n453, which has yielded ample statistical and qualitative evidence of inter-racial minority cohesion. \nNo party has purported to offer individual point estimates of Hispanic and Asian voting in Virginia \nBeach, and for good reason: As Dr. Spencer testified, it is impossible to calculate those point esti-\nmates reliably because there are no voting precincts where Hispanics or Asians make up a suffi-\nciently high proportion of the population. Defs. Ex. 6 at 70-73. Defendants would have the Court \nignore all the existing evidence of cohesion because Plaintiffs did not supplement it with an addi-\ntional piece of evidence that does not and cannot exist (and is not required). Granting summary \njudgment on this basis would not only violate the Court’s duty to view the evidence “in the light \nmost favorable to” the nonmoving party, Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970), \nbut also unjustly condemn Plaintiffs and their communities “to suffer a violation of their rights \n \n21 For example, as the court recognized in Campos, sometimes two minority communities are about \nequally concentrated in the same voting precincts, which can make it “nearly impossible to attrib-\nute the votes of those precincts to one minority group or the other but quite possible to determine \nwhether the two minority groups together are politically cohesive.” Id. at 1245 n.6. In such cir-\ncumstances, the court should not punish the plaintiff for failing to perform impossible calculations. \nSee id. Instead, it should work with the reliable evidence available after a diligent inquiry, which \nmay include aggregated statistics on minority voting as well as qualitative evidence of political \ncohesion. See id. at 1245-48; Bridgeport Coal. for Fair Representation, 26 F.3d at 276 (upholding \nfinding of Black-Hispanic cohesion based on “both testimonial and statistical evidence,” where \nstatistical evidence of Hispanic voting was limited to results of two elections); see also Pataki, 308 \nF. Supp. 2d at 421. \n  35 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 38 of 44 PageID# 2307\nunder the [VRA] because of external circumstances that limit the availability of data.” Jenkins, 4 \nF.3d at 1134. \nB.  Contrary  to  Defendants’  Suggestion,  Plaintiffs’  Case  Does  Not  Hinge  on \nEquivalence Test Results  \n \nDr. Spencer’s initial report alone proves cohesion among HBA voters in Virginia Beach, \nincluding through unchallenged evidence showing cohesion in exogenous elections and reconsti-\ntuted election results. Yet, Defendants spend almost one-third of their brief discussing the equiva-\nlence testing Dr. Spencer performed for his rebuttal report. Defendants’ fixation on equivalence \ntesting demonstrates a deeply flawed understanding of this technique and its role in this case. Con-\ntrary to Defendants’ suggestion, equivalence testing is not necessary to prove cohesion among \nHispanic, Black, and Asian voters in this case. \nFirst, Defendants mischaracterize why Dr. Spencer provided individual estimates of voter \npreferences for each racial group, and why he performed equivalence testing in the first place. \nThey argue incorrectly that “Spencer’[s] rebuttal report . . . is largely an attempt to remedy the \ndeficiencies of the data he produced in his Initial Report.” Defs. Br. at 18. As Dr. Spencer explained \nat length in his rebuttal report, the report’s purpose was to respond to criticisms from Dr. Kidd, \nwho, among other things, admitted that individual estimates are unreliable, yet criticized Dr. Spen-\ncer for not providing them. Pls. Ex. _8 at 17. From the start, Dr. Spencer chose to model only \ncombined estimates, because individual estimates for Hispanic and Asian voters are not reliable in \nVirginia Beach, a fact that he stated explicitly in his rebuttal report.22 Defs. Ex. 5 at 6-7; Defs. Ex. \n \n22 In footnote 12 of their brief, Defendants claim that Dr. Spencer’s explanation that “he was only \nperforming equivalence testing to show why he had not isolated the three minority groups in the \nfirst place” was “deeply misleading.” Defs Br. at 24, n.12. That is plainly wrong. As Plaintiffs \nhave already explained, Defendants’ own expert criticized Dr. Spencer for not providing unreliable \nindividual estimates, and Dr. Spencer explained this thoroughly in his rebuttal report. See Defs. \nEx. 5 at 6-7. \n  36 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 39 of 44 PageID# 2308\n6 at 68:20-69:16. In response to Dr. Kidd’s circular criticism, Dr. Spencer calculated individual \nestimates for Hispanic, Black, and Asian voter preferences using ecological inference, giving De-\nfendants just what they asked for: unreliable individual estimates for Hispanic and Asian voters. \nDefs. Ex. 6 at 143:9-146:5, 153:17-154:4. Defs. Ex. 7. He then used equivalence testing, which is \na basic “statistical procedure” used to “determine whether . . .two groups. . . are equivalent in some \nway,” to compare “the distributions of black, Hispanic, and Asian vote shares . . . against the \nthreshold needed for a candidate to win his/her election.” Pls. Ex. 5 at 96:6-14; Defs. Ex. 5 at 8. \nThis analysis resulted in Table 1 in Dr. Spencer’s rebuttal report. Rather than a “flailing second \nattempt at proving cohesion,” Defs. Br. at 24, the purpose of Dr. Spencer’s calculation of individ-\nual estimates, along with equivalence testing, was to show that the individual estimates alone are \nnot reliable measures of candidate preference, and thus why he necessarily relied on the combined \nminority estimates in his initial report. Defs. Ex. 6 at 125:11-127:5; Defs. Ex. 5 at 6-7. \nPlaintiffs’ experts have testified at length as to why Dr. Spencer’s equivalence testing can-\nnot be used to reliably estimate individual group voting preferences. Id.; Defs. Ex. 8 at 59:9-60:9, \n67:19-68:9. Defendants’ expert also agrees that individual estimates are not reliable in Virginia \nBeach. Pls. Ex. 8 at 17. It is thus puzzling why Defendants, who argue that Plaintiffs cannot prove \ncohesion in this case because they present no reliable estimates of individual preferences for His-\npanic and Asian voters, proceed to use these same unreliable estimates to comment on candidate \npreferences. Defs. Br. at 18-26. A prime example of this is Defendants’ Table A, which is mean-\ningless when put into context. See id. at 20. Defendants allege that Table A shows that “black and \nAsian support levels are easily distinguishable from one another . . .” Id. However, Table A pre-\nsents only point estimates for Asian voter support levels and fails to take into account the wide \nconfidence intervals for Asian estimates inherent in Virginia Beach given the population size. See \n  37 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 40 of 44 PageID# 2309\nDefs. Ex. 8 at 67:19-68:9; Defs Ex. 6 at 125:11-127:5. Plaintiffs’ experts have testified that not \nonly are the point estimates alone unreliable, but that it is impossible to tell anything meaningful \nabout any differences between two different groups without considering the standard error and/or \nconfidence interval. Id. When Table A is reconfigured to include the large confidence intervals, it \nis apparent just how little certainty is present in the Asian estimates alone. See Pls. Ex. 27. De-\nfendants Table A is, at best, misleading and gives the Court no useful information about any sim-\nilarities or differences between Black and Asian voter preferences.  \nDefendants also criticize the threshold Dr. Spencer uses in his equivalence testing, stating \nthat “Spencer’s premise—one without apparent support in case law—is that if each minority \ngroup’s level of support exceeds the victory threshold, cohesion exists.” Defs. Br. at 21. This claim \nis also meritless. The threshold Dr. Spencer uses is the vote total of the winning candidate, which \nis a more conservative threshold than necessary. Defs. Ex. 6 at 128:129:14. In other words, it \nmakes it less likely that minority voters will be considered cohesive. If Dr. Spencer used a lower \nthreshold as Defendants suggest, such as 50%+1 in a two-candidate race, or a 33%+1 in a three or \nmore candidate race, almost every single minority candidate of choice in Defs. Ex. 7, Dr. Spencer’s \nTable 1, or Defendants Table A would exceed the threshold, given the unreliable nature of the \nindividual Hispanic and Asian estimates. See, e.g., Defs. Ex. 7; Defs. Ex. 5 at 8; Defs. Br. at 20; \nDisputed Fact No. 33, supra. \nDefendants make numerous other errors in their discussion of equivalence testing, resulting \nin an incoherent and inaccurate analysis. For example, Defendants discuss candidate Aaron Rouse \nand the level of Hispanic support for him according to the individual estimates, stating that “one \nmight assume that, as Spencer’s point estimate for Hispanic support (33.3%) falls well below his \nself-identified threshold (45.2%), Spencer would conclude that Hispanics did not share blacks’ \n  38 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 41 of 44 PageID# 2310\nand Asians’ apparent preference for candidate Rouse.” Defs. Br. at 21-22. This analysis is wrong \nfor at least two reasons. First, Defendants fail to account for the confidence interval, which is \nnecessary to determine if any of the estimates are statistically significantly different.23 Once the \nconfidence interval (42%) is considered, Hispanic support for Rouse ranges from 0% to 74.3%, \nmeaning it is not “against all odds and common sense” for Hispanic support to surpass the more \nconservative threshold of 45.2%. Defs. Ex. 7; Defs. Br. at 21-22.24 Second, Rouse was one of six \ncandidates running for two at-large seats in 2018, meaning that the plurality threshold would be \n33% plus one vote, which would put the individual estimate of Hispanic support right at the plu-\nrality threshold (even without considering the confidence interval). See Defs. Ex. 7; Defs. Ex. 4 at \n14. Thus, if Defendants prefer a lower threshold, the Hispanic level of support for Rouse would \nalso meet it. \n  Defendants’ focus on and criticism of equivalence testing is a red herring. Plaintiffs’ ex-\nperts have stated from the beginning that individual estimates of voter preference for Hispanic and \nAsian voters in Virginia Beach are not reliable. Dr. Spencer has unequivocally stated that the com-\nbined estimates are reliable, and thus equivalence testing is not necessary to show cohesion in this \n \n23 The confidence interval can be calculated by multiplying the standard error by 1.96 if a normal \ndistribution is present (and it is here). Defs. Ex. 6 at 44:10-17. \n24 Plaintiffs cannot point out all of the Defendants’ errors and mischaracterizations in discussing \nequivalence testing here, but there are several more. One includes Defendants’ discussion of Aaron \nRouse and the percent of his distribution above and below the 45.2% threshold. Defs. Br. at 23. \nThat percentage is relevant, but what one would really need to know to make sense of the distri-\nbution is the probability that any chosen value within the distribution would fall above or below \nthat threshold, not just the percentage above or below the threshold itself. Another example is the \nDefendants discussion of the “10% overlap standard.” Id. at 22. Again, a 10% overlap in this case \nis actually higher than usually used, making it a more conservative threshold. If a 5% threshold \nwere used, even more of the distributions would exceed the threshold. Further, Defendants’ mis-\nstate Dr. Lichtman’s testimony when they say he “knows little about” equivalence testing. Id. at \n25. To the contrary, Dr. Lichtman testified that he read an article about the method published in \n1993, and that it is used in a variety of fields. Defs. Ex. 8 at 222-224. \n  39 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 118   Filed 11/05/19   Page 42 of 44 PageID# 2311\ncase. See, e.g., Defs. Ex. 5 at 6. In response to criticism from Dr. Kidd, Dr. Spencer calculated \nthese unreliable individual estimates, but not to prove cohesion among individual racial groups. If \nDefendants insist on using the unreliable individual estimates produced by Dr. Spencer to make \nconclusions, at worst the individual estimates and equivalence testing show that cohesion among \nHispanic, Black, and Asian voters cannot be ruled out, and at best they confirm this cohesion.25 \nSee generally id. at 6-9.

CIVIL ACTION NO.  2:18-cv-69\nCITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH,\nVIRGINIA, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nBefore the Court is Defendants’ Motion for Certification of Appealability pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1292(b). ECF No. 127. On March 19, 2020, Defendants filed a motion and supporting \nmemorandum following the Court’s denial of its Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF Nos.126–\n128. Defendants request that this Court, either by entry of a new Order or by amending its prior \nOrder, certify for appeal the question of whether tri-minority coalition claims, or coalition claims \ngenerally, are cognizable under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301 (“VRA”).\nECF No. 128 at 4; ECF No. 130 at 4. On March 31, 2020, Plaintiffs opposed the motion arguing \nthat Defendants failed to satisfy the required elements for an interlocutory appeal. ECF No. 129. \nOn April 6, 2020,Defendants filed a reply. ECF No. 130. \nSection 1292(b) of Title 28 of the United States Code allows a district judge to certify an\norder for appellate review if (1) the order “involves a controlling question of law,” (2) “there is \nsubstantial ground for difference of opinion,” and (3) “an immediate appeal from that order may \nmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” The procedural requirements for an \ninterlocutory appeal under § 1292(b) must be strictly construed. Myles v. Laffitte, 881 F.2d 125, \n127 (4th Cir.1989). Even if all requirements are met, however, the decision to certify issues for \n1\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 134   Filed 04/16/20   Page 2 of 3 PageID# 4642\ninterlocutory appeal rests solely within the district court’s discretion. McDaniel v. Mehfoud, 708 \nF.Supp. 754, 756 (E.D.Va. 1989). Given the “basic policy of postponing appellate review until \nafter the court has entered final judgment in the case,” the party moving for certification under §\n1292(b) has the burden of persuading the court that “exceptional circumstances justify departure \nfrom that policy.” North Carolina ex rel. Howes v. W.R. Peele, Sr. Trust, 889 F.Supp. 849, 853 \n(E.D.N.C.1995) (citations omitted).\nDefendants have not met its burden of establishing that exceptional circumstances justify \nan interlocutory appeal. First, an interlocutory appeal of Defendants’ proposed legal question will \nnot materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. 28 U.S.C. 1292(b). Defendants\ncontend that the legal question presented regarding the viability of tri-minority coalition claims, \n“may serve to avoid trial.” ECF No. 28 at 6. However, the material-advancement requirement is \nmet in exceptional circumstances that will avoid protracted and expensive litigation.  SeeEstate of \nGiron Alvarez v. Johns Hopkins Univ., No. CV TDC-15-0950, 2019 WL 1779339, at *2 (D. Md. \nApr. 23, 2019) (citing Fannin v. CSX Transp., Inc., 873 F.2d 1438 (4th Cir. 1989)). Here, the\nCourt does not find any exceptional circumstances. Thediscovery in this case is nearlycomplete, \nand the Court, on March 11, 2020, denied Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. \n126. The parties are scheduled foran additional Rule 16(b) conference onApril 16, 2020.See ECF \nNo 129-1.Trial is projected to take place in either September or October 2020. Id.Therefore, this\ncase will likely be litigated before the conclusion of an interlocutory appeal. See Difelice v. U.S. \nAirways, Inc., 404 F.Supp. 2d 907, 910 (E.D. Va. 2005) (noting that the material-advancement \nprong was not satisfied because “it is likely that this case will be fully litigated in the district court \nbefore the conclusion of any interlocutory appeal”). Given these facts, the Court finds that \n2\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 134   Filed 04/16/20   Page 3 of 3 PageID# 4643\nDefendants’ failed to meet its burden that its proposed legal question will materially advance the \nultimate termination of the litigation. \nFurthermore, even if Defendantsdid meet all the requirements for an interlocutory appeal, \nthis Court would use its discretion and deny Defendants’ a certificate of appealability.Defendants \nhave not persuaded this Court that exceptional circumstances justify departure from the basic \npolicy of postponing appellate review until after this Court enters a final judgment in this case. \nNorth Carolina ex rel. Howes, 889 F. Supp. at 853. Because this case has been on the Court’s \ndocket for over two years and involves claims that should be fully litigated given the genuine \ndispute as to material facts, the circumstances in this case favor the general rule of postponing\nappellate review until after final judgment.See ECF Nos. 1, 126. In addition, the full factual record \ndeveloped at trial will greatly enhance anyappellate review of whether coalition claims are legally \ncognizable under Section 2 of the VRA. Thus, having considered the foregoing analysis under \nSection 1292(b), the Court does not find it appropriate to amend its March 11, 2020 Order or to \notherwise enter a new Order to issue a certification of appealability. Accordingly, Defendants’ \nMotion for Certification of Appealabilityis DENIED.\nThe Clerk is DIRECTEDto send a copy of this Order to counsel for the parties. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nNorfolk, Virginia \n(cid:56)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:45)(cid:88)(cid:71)(cid:74)(cid:72)\nApril    (cid:20)  (cid:25)  , 2020 \n3",

Winback & Conserve Program, Inc., 42 F.3d 1421, 1427 \n(3d Cir. 1994)). \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction has the evidentiary burden of satisfying four \nprerequisites:  (1) that she is likely to succeed on the merits of the case, (2) that she is likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of the requested preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of \nequities tips in her favor, and (4) that an injunction serves the public interest.  Winter v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365 (2008). \nThe purpose of preliminary injunctive relief in most cases is to “preserve the status \nquo pending a final trial on the merits.”  Hoechst Diafoil Co. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d \n411, 422, (4th Cir. 1999); Di Biase v. SPX Corp., 872 F.3d 224, 230 (4th Cir. 2017) (“A \npreliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy intended to protect the status quo and prevent \nirreparable harm during the pendency of a lawsuit”).  The United States Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit has defined “status quo”—in the context of requests for preliminary injunctive \nrelief—as the \"last uncontested status between the parties which preceded the controversy.”  \nPashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 320 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Aggarao v. MOL Ship Mgmt. Co., \nLtd., 675 F.3d 355, 378 (4th Cir. 2012)). \nThose preliminary injunctions that extend beyond maintaining the status quo are termed \n“mandatory” injunctions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. (In re Microsoft Corp. \nAntitrust Litig.), 333 F.3d 517, 526 (4th Cir. 2003).  Because such an injunction constitutes an \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 39   Filed 07/12/18   Page 3 of 6 PageID# 214\neven more drastic type of relief, the Fourth Circuit has held that a heightened standard is \nappropriate in such cases: \n‘Mandatory preliminary injunctions [generally] do not preserve the status quo and \nnormally should be granted only in those circumstances when the exigencies of the \nsituation demand such relief.’ Wetzel v. Edwards, 635 F.2d 283, 286 (4th Cir. \n1980). That is to say, a mandatory preliminary injunction must be necessary both \nto protect against irreparable harm in a deteriorating circumstance created by the \ndefendant and to preserve the court's ability to enter ultimate relief on the merits \nof the same kind.  \n \nId. (emphases added). \nArgument \nIn the instant action, Plaintiff cannot satisfy its heighten burden to prove the four required \nconditions necessary to warrant the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction, as \nestablished by the Supreme Court of the United States in Winter. 129 S. Ct. 365 (2008). \nFirst, Plaintiff is not likely to succeed on the merits of her case.  The City has chronicled \nthe deficiencies of the Complaint in its Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss for \nFailure to State a Claim, ECF No. 14, and in its Reply to Plaintiff’s Response to Motion to \nDismiss for Failure to State a Claim, ECF No. 30.  For the reasons stated in those briefs, the \nCity maintains that not only is Plaintiff unlikely to succeed on the merits, her Complaint fails to \nplausibly state any claim upon which relief can be granted.  Without reciting each of the \narguments the City has already advanced, it suffices to point out that Plaintiff has wholly failed \nto establish that African Americans are a group both sufficiently large and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district within the City of Virginia \nBeach—which is but one of three preconditions that must be satisfied before a fact-intensive \n‘totality-of-the-circumstances’ inquiry is undertaken.  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50 \n(1986). \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 39   Filed 07/12/18   Page 4 of 6 PageID# 215\nSecond, Plaintiff cannot reasonably claim that the Court’s enjoining the City from \nholding elections will prevent her from suffering irreparable harm.  Postponing the election \nscheduled for November 6, 2018, would merely freeze in place current office holders—namely \nthe mayor and other councilmembers—who were, per Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations, elected \nby an “at-large election voting scheme [that] constitutes an illegal vote dilution device.”  \nMemorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Request a Preliminary Injunction at 3, ECF No. \n35.  Plaintiff’s requested injunction would, ironically, extinguish any possibility that an African \nAmerican might prevail at the ballot box this November and thereby replace a non-African \nAmerican council member whose tenure would be extended by the injunction Plaintiff seeks.  \nFurthermore, in the absence of the requested injunction, the remedy Plaintiff seeks will still be \navailable to her at the conclusion of this litigation. \nThird, the equities do not favor granting Plaintiff’s request for preliminary relief. As \ndiscussed, the practical effect of such relief would in no way remedy the alleged harm of which \nthe Plaintiff complains.  The City, meanwhile, would incur a heavy burden and untold expense \nwere it required to delay an already scheduled election. \nFinally, the public interest would not be served by the suspension of the democratic \nprocess that Plaintiff requests. \nIn addition, because Plaintiff’s Motion to Request a Preliminary Injunction seeks relief \nthat goes far beyond preserving the status quo1, the heightened standard articulated by the Fourth \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiff’s requested injunction might appear to preserve the “status quo” because enjoining the \nCity from conducting elections would freeze in place present office holders. However, as the \nCity explains elsewhere, this is not a status quo that remediates prior harms or restores an \n“uncontested status between the parties which preceded the controversy.\" Pashby v. Delia, 709 \nF.3d 307, 320, (4th Cir. 2013). \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM   Document 39   Filed 07/12/18   Page 5 of 6 PageID# 216\nCircuit Court of Appeals in Sun Microsystems, Inc. applies. 333 F.3d 517 (4th Cir. 2003). \nBecause the election system challenged by the Plaintiff has long been in place, there is not \npresent a “deteriorating circumstance” to mitigate against; nor is an injunction required to \n“preserve the court's ability to enter ultimate relief on the merits.”  Id. at 526. \nIn sum, the preliminary injunctive relief Plaintiff seeks is futile with respect to advancing \nher interests and, in any case, wholly inappropriate in the present context. \nConclusion \n \nRelying on the arguments set forth herein, Defendant City of Virginia Beach respectfully \nasks this Court to deny Plaintiff’s Motion to Request a Preliminary Injunction. \n      CITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH \n \n \n      By:_________/s/________________ \n        Of Counsel \n \nMark D.

City of Virginia Beach \n \n \n2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM  \n________________________ \n \nNOTICE OF JUDGMENT \n________________________ \nJudgment was entered on this date in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 36. Please be \nadvised of the following time periods: \n \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI: The time to file a petition for writ of \ncertiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment sought to be reviewed, and not \nfrom the date of issuance of the mandate. If a petition for rehearing is timely filed in \nthe court of appeals, the time to file the petition for writ of certiorari for all parties runs \nfrom the date of the denial of the petition for rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing \nis granted, the subsequent entry of judgment. See Rule 13 of the Rules of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States; www.supremecourt.gov. \n \nVOUCHERS FOR PAYMENT OF APPOINTED OR ASSIGNED COUNSEL: \nVouchers must be submitted within 60 days of entry of judgment or denial of \nrehearing, whichever is later. If counsel files a petition for certiorari, the 60-day period \nruns from filing the certiorari petition. (Loc. R. 46(d)). If payment is being made from \nCJA funds, counsel should submit the CJA 20 or CJA 30 Voucher through the CJA \neVoucher system. In cases not covered by the Criminal Justice Act, counsel should \nsubmit the Assigned Counsel Voucher to the clerk's office for payment from the \nAttorney Admission Fund. An Assigned Counsel Voucher will be sent to counsel \nshortly after entry of judgment. Forms and instructions are also available on the court's \nweb site, www.ca4.uscourts.gov, or from the clerk's office.  \n \nBILL OF COSTS: A party to whom costs are allowable, who desires taxation of \ncosts, shall file a Bill of Costs within 14 calendar days of entry of judgment. (FRAP \n39, Loc. R. 39(b)).  \n \n \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 94-1            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 2 of 3 Total Pages:(2 of 6)\nPETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN \nBANC: A petition for rehearing must be filed within 14 calendar days after entry of \njudgment, except that in civil cases in which the United States or its officer or agency \nis a party, the petition must be filed within 45 days after entry of judgment. A petition \nfor rehearing en banc must be filed within the same time limits and in the same \ndocument as the petition for rehearing and must be clearly identified in the title. The \nonly grounds for an extension of time to file a petition for rehearing are the death or \nserious illness of counsel or a family member (or of a party or family member in pro se \ncases) or an extraordinary circumstance wholly beyond the control of counsel or a \nparty proceeding without counsel.  \n \nEach case number to which the petition applies must be listed on the petition and \nincluded in the docket entry to identify the cases to which the petition applies. A \ntimely filed petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc stays the mandate \nand tolls the running of time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari. In consolidated \ncriminal appeals, the filing of a petition for rehearing does not stay the mandate as to \nco-defendants not joining in the petition for rehearing. In consolidated civil appeals \narising from the same civil action, the court's mandate will issue at the same time in all \nappeals.  \n \nA petition for rehearing must contain an introduction stating that, in counsel's \njudgment, one or more of the following situations exist: (1) a material factual or legal \nmatter was overlooked; (2) a change in the law occurred after submission of the case \nand was overlooked; (3) the opinion conflicts with a decision of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, this court, or another court of appeals, and the conflict was not addressed; or (4) \nthe case involves one or more questions of exceptional importance. A petition for \nrehearing, with or without a petition for rehearing en banc, may not exceed 3900 words \nif prepared by computer and may not exceed 15 pages if handwritten or prepared on a \ntypewriter. Copies are not required unless requested by the court. (FRAP 35 & 40, \nLoc. R. 40(c)). \n \nMANDATE: In original proceedings before this court, there is no mandate. Unless the \ncourt shortens or extends the time, in all other cases, the mandate issues 7 days after \nthe expiration of the time for filing a petition for rehearing. A timely petition for \nrehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion to stay the mandate will stay \nissuance of the mandate. If the petition or motion is denied, the mandate will issue 7 \ndays later. A motion to stay the mandate will ordinarily be denied, unless the motion \npresents a substantial question or otherwise sets forth good or probable cause for a \nstay. (FRAP 41, Loc. R. 41). \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 94-1            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 3 of 3 Total Pages:(3 of 6)\nU.S. COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT BILL OF COSTS FORM \n(Civil Cases)  \nDirections: Under FRAP 39(a), the costs of appeal in a civil action are generally taxed against appellant if a \njudgment is affirmed or the appeal is dismissed. Costs are generally taxed against appellee if a judgment is \nreversed. If a judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed as the court \norders. A party who wants costs taxed must, within 14 days after entry of judgment, file an itemized and \nverified bill of costs, as follows:  \n• Itemize any fee paid for docketing the appeal. The fee for docketing a case in the court of appeals is $500 \n(effective 12/1/2013). The $5 fee for filing a notice of appeal is recoverable as a cost in the district court.  \n• Itemize the costs (not to exceed $.15 per page) for copying the necessary number of formal briefs and \nappendices. (Effective 10/1/2015, the court requires 1 copy when filed; 3 more copies when tentatively \ncalendared; 0 copies for service unless brief/appendix is sealed.). The court bases the cost award on the page \ncount of the electronic brief/appendix. Costs for briefs filed under an informal briefing order are not \nrecoverable.  \n• Cite the statutory authority for an award of costs if costs are sought for or against the United States. See 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412 (limiting costs to civil actions); 28 U.S.C. § 1915(f)(1) (prohibiting award of costs against the \nUnited States in cases proceeding without prepayment of fees).  \nAny objections to the bill of costs must be filed within 14 days of service of the bill of costs. Costs are paid \ndirectly to the prevailing party or counsel, not to the clerk's office. \nCase Number & Caption: _____________________________________________________ \nPrevailing Party Requesting Taxation of Costs: ____________________________________ \nAppellate Docketing Fee (prevailing \nAmount Requested: ______  Amount Allowed: _____ \nappellants):  \nPage \nDocument  No. of Pages  No. of Copies  Cost  Total Cost \n(<$.15) \nAllowed   Allowed   Allowed  \n   Requested  Requested     Requested \n(court use only)  (court use only)  (court use only) \n                       \n                       \n                       \nTOTAL BILL OF COSTS:  $0.00  $0.00 \n1.  If copying was done commercially, I have attached itemized bills. If copying was done in-house, I certify that my \nstandard billing amount is not less than $.15 per copy or, if less, I have reduced the amount charged to the lesser rate. \n2. If costs are sought for or against the United States, I further certify that 28 U.S.C. § 2412 permits an award of costs. \n3.  I declare under penalty of perjury that these costs are true and correct and were necessarily incurred in this action.  \nSignature: __________________________________          Date: _____________________________ \nCertificate of Service  \nI certify that on this date I served this document as follows:  \nSignature: _______________________________          Date: _________________________________  \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 94-2            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 1 of 3 Total Pages:(4 of 6)\n \n \nFILED: July 27, 2022 \n \n \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT  \n___________________ \nNo. 21-1533 (L) \n(2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM) \n___________________ \nLATASHA HOLLOWAY; GEORGIA ALLEN \n \n                     Plaintiffs - Appellees \n \nv. \n \nTHE CITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH; the VIRGINIA BEACH CITY COUNCIL; \nDONNA PATTERSON, in her official capacity as General Registrar for the City \nof Virginia Beach; ROBERT DYER, in his official capacity as the Mayor of \nVirginia Beach; PATRICK DUHANEY, in his official capacity as City Manager \nof Virginia Beach; MICHAEL BERLUCCHI, in his official capacity as member \nof the Virginia Beach City Council; BARBARA HENLEY, in her official \ncapacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; LOUIS JONES, in his \nofficial capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; JOHN MOSS, in \nhis official capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; AARON \nROUSE, in his official capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; \nGUY TOWER, in his official capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City \nCouncil; ROSEMARY WILSON, in her official capacity as Vice Mayor of \nVirginia Beach; SABRINA WOOTEN, in her official capacity as member of the \nVirginia Beach City Council; ROCKY HOLCOMB, in his official capacity as \nmember of the Virginia Beach City Council; LINWOOD BRANCH, in his official \ncapacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council  \n \n                     Defendants – Appellants \n \n \n------------------------------ \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 94-2            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 2 of 3 Total Pages:(5 of 6)\n \n \nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA \n \n                    Amicus Supporting Appellants \n \nBRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE AT NYU SCHOOL OF LAW; \nSOUTHERN COALITION FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE \n \n                    Amici Supporting Appellees \n \n___________________ \n \nNo. 21-2431 \n(2:18-cv-00069-RAJ-DEM)  \n___________________ \n  \nLATASHA HOLLOWAY; GEORGIA ALLEN \n \n                     Plaintiffs - Appellees \n \nv. \n \nTHE CITY OF VIRGINIA BEACH; the VIRGINIA BEACH CITY COUNCIL; \nDONNA PATTERSON, in her official capacity as General Registrar for the City \nof Virginia Beach; ROBERT DYER, in his official capacity as the Mayor of \nVirginia Beach; PATRICK DUHANEY, in his official capacity as City Manager \nof Virginia Beach; MICHAEL BERLUCCHI, in his official capacity as member \nof the Virginia Beach City Council; BARBARA HENLEY, in her official \ncapacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; LOUIS JONES, in his \nofficial capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; JOHN MOSS, in \nhis official capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; AARON \nROUSE, in his official capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council; \nGUY TOWER, in his official capacity as member of the Virginia Beach City \nCouncil; ROSEMARY WILSON, in her official capacity as Vice Mayor of \nVirginia Beach; SABRINA WOOTEN, in her official capacity as member of the \nVirginia Beach City Council; ROCKY HOLCOMB, in his official capacity as \nmember of the Virginia Beach City Council; LINWOOD BRANCH, in his official \ncapacity as member of the Virginia Beach City Council  \n \n                     Defendants - Appellants \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 94-2            Filed: 07/27/2022      Pg: 3 of 3 Total Pages:(6 of 6)\n \n \n------------------------------ \n \n \nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA \n \n                    Amicus Supporting Appellants \n \nBRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE AT NYU SCHOOL OF LAW; \nSOUTHERN COALITION FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE \n \n                    Amici Supporting Appellees \n___________________ \nJ U D G M E N T \n___________________ \n  In accordance with the decision of this court, the district court order entered \nMarch 31, 2021, is vacated.

Not one \nperson of Hispanic or Asian descent joined the lawsuit. Neither this Court nor \nthe Supreme Court has approved Plaintiffs’ coalitional theory, and the Sixth \nCircuit  rejected  it  25  years  ago  as  incompatible  with  the  Act’s  plain  text, \nstructure, and purpose. See Nixon v. Kent Cnty., 76 F.3d 1381 (6th Cir. 1996) (en \nbanc). Meanwhile, those courts endorsing coalitional claims have set a high bar \nfor establishing coalitional “cohesion,” demanding proof that majorities of each \nalleged constituency share candidate preferences with members of their own \nconstituency  and  the  others.  The  Supreme  Court  has  confirmed  that,  if \ncoalitional  claims  are  even  cognizable,  a  “higher-than-usual”  need  for  this \nshowing “obviously” applies. Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40-41 (1993). \nYet Plaintiffs failed to present a single estimate of Asian or Hispanic \ncohesion. In fact, the unrebutted testimony below established that members of \nthe Filipino community, the City’s largest Asian group, often vote against Black-\npreferred candidates. Undeterred by the Supreme Court’s condemnation of the \nassumption “that members of the same racial group…think alike, share the same \npolitical interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls,” Shaw v. Reno, \n509 U.S. 630, 647 (1993), Plaintiffs insisted that members of different groups \nshare these attributes simply because they are not white. And they persisted in \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 12 of 65 Total Pages:(12 of 78)\n \ndemanding an injunction against the at-large system even after the Virginia \nGeneral Assembly effectively repealed it, ensuring that it will never govern \nanother election. \n The district court’s ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor was erroneous. The court \nlacked  jurisdiction  to  advise  that  a  repealed  system  violates  the  Act.  It \nerroneously concluded that two Black  voters may press  a coalitional claim \npredicated on an alleged injury to tens of thousands of non-party “Minority” \nvoters  without  establishing  the  elements  of  third-party  standing.  It  misread \nSection 2’s guarantee of racial equality to protect the supposed political coalition \nof persons sharing no racial or ethnic common denominator—even though the \ncourt-appointed special master concluded that it is not “statistically possible to \ndetermine  the  voting  behavior  of  African-American,  Asian-American,  and \nHispanic  populations  individually.”  SJA235.  The  court  applied  a  relaxed \ncohesion standard where the Supreme Court commanded a strict standard. And, \nultimately, it gave its imprimatur to a misguided and affirmatively harmful effort \nto utilize persons of Hispanic and Asian descent instrumentally to advance the \ncause  of  a  group  that  cannot  on  its  own  meet  the  Section  2  criteria  (an \nundisputed  point  the  district  court  still,  somehow,  got  wrong).  Coalitional \nclaims are “fraught with risks.” LULAC, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 986 F.2d \n728, 785 n.43 (5th Cir. 1993) (“LULAC”). They should not be allowed. And, \ncertainty, this one should not be allowed. The Court should reverse.   \n2 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 13 of 65 Total Pages:(13 of 78)\n \nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION \nJurisdiction in the district court was proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1342(a).  The  district  court  issued  an  injunction  on  March  31,  2021,  and \nDefendants appealed on April 29, 2021. JA1278. This Court subsequently held \nthat appeal in abeyance pending final judgment, which has since been issued \nand separately appealed. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. \nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES \n1.  Is this case moot? \n2.  Do two Black Plaintiffs have standing to assert alleged interests of \nAsian and Hispanic voters? \n3.  Does Section 2 protect “coalitions” of different groups, and, if so, \nwhat legal standards apply to such a claim? \n4.  Did the district court commit legal or clear error in its Section 2 \nanalysis? \n5.  Is an injunction ordering Virginia Beach to comply with Section 2 \nsufficiently definite?   \n3 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 14 of 65 Total Pages:(14 of 78)\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.  Factual Background \n1.  Virginia Beach is Virginia’s most populous city. JA1153. It assumed \nits current form in 1963 when the City “consolidated with adjoining Princess \nAnne County, which was both rural and urban.” Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. 112, \n113  (1967);  JA1153.  The  Virginia  General  Assembly—which  regulates  the \nCity’s elections—attempted “to produce a plan which would be acceptable to \nthe voters in the half of the county which was rural and to those in the half which \nwas urban and which would, at the same time, win the support of the voters in \nthe old city.” Davis v. Dusch, 205 Va. 676, 677 (1964); JA1154-55. But its original \neffort, allocating members to the City Council through a borough system, “was \ninvalidated in 1965 under the one-person, one-vote principle.” JA1155; Dusch, \n387 U.S. at 114. \nIn response, the General Assembly instituted a system of at-large voting. \nJA1155. The Council comprises eleven members. Four, including the mayor, \nwere elected at large without regard to residence, and seven were elected at-large \nbut  were  required  to  reside,  respectively,  one  in  each  of  seven  residency \ndistricts.1 Dusch, 387 U.S. at 114; JA1151. This system also faced an equal-\nprotection challenge, but the Supreme Court rejected it, finding the system \n“makes  no  distinction  on  the  basis  of  race,  creed,  or  economic  status  or \n \n1 Because Plaintiffs do not contend the mayor should be elected from a single-\nmember district, this brief refers to the residency scheme as having three at-large \npositions. \n4 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 15 of 65 Total Pages:(15 of 78)\n \nlocation,” bore no hint of “invidious discrimination,” and served the City’s \n“compelling need” to create “a detente between urban and rural communities \nthat  may  be  important  in  resolving  the  complex  problems  of  the  modern \nmegalopolis in relation to the city, the suburbia, and the rural countryside.” \nDusch, 387 U.S. at 115-17.2 \nThe at-large system was used through the November 2020 councilmanic \nelections and is the system challenged in this case. The City, however, has \nperiodically  examined  whether  to  recommend  a  change  to  the  General \nAssembly.  For  example,  “[i]n  1990,  the  City  conducted  a  ‘comprehensive \nreview…,’ seeking ‘views from every conceivable interested party as to the best \nmanner to provide representation for the citizens of the City.’” JA1157 (citation \nomitted). As the district court recounted, “[t]he City declined proposals for race-\nbased single-member districts that ‘stretched nearly all the way across the City, \nand in many instances’ were ‘only a block wide or came together at a single \npoint.’”  JA1157  (citation  omitted).  The  Eastern  District  of  Virginia  “also \nrejected these racial gerrymanders and the Voting Rights Act lawsuit that sought \nto impose them.” JA1157. \nThe City also has redrawn its residency districts after the release of each \ndecennial census to maintain them at substantially equal population. In 2011, \nthe City adopted a new residency plan, including one residency district drawn \n \n2  The  district  court’s  assertion  that  “Defendants’  [sic]  have  not  proffered  a \nreasonable  explanation  for  designing  such  system,”  JA1277,  is  therefore \nperplexing. See Dist.Ct.Dkt.237 at 1-3. \n5 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 16 of 65 Total Pages:(16 of 78)\n \nwith a near majority racial and ethnic minority populations. JA1276. The U.S. \nDepartment of Justice precleared the plan under Section 5 of the Act. JA2184. \n2.  As of the 2010 Census, white residents composed 64.49% of the \nCity’s population (and 67.38% of the voting-age population), Black residents \n19.00% (18.10%), Hispanic residents 6.62% (5.64%), and Asian residents 6.01% \n(6.30%).  JA1159.  Members  of  these  disparate  minority  groups  are  not \nsignificantly concentrated in any portion of the City. JA2187-90; JA0675-78. In \nparticular, the Asian population is widely distributed within the City. JA0677; \nJA0716. \nThrough  the  Civil  Rights  Era,  Virginia  Beach,  like  most  southern \njurisdictions, imposed de jure and de facto discrimination against Black residents. \nThe City regrets these injustices. However, the Asian and Hispanic communities \nare relatively new to the City and do not share that history. JA2277; JA1057-59; \nJA1001-02.  The  largest  of  the  Asian  communities  is  the  “vibrant  Filipino \ncommunity,” which has grown in the City largely by consequence of the Naval \npresence there. JA1160; JA1057. Multiple trial witnesses—including the City’s \nredistricting consultant, leaders of the Filipino community, and an expert in \nlocal  politics—testified  that  the  Filipino  community  is  conservative,  leans \nRepublican,  is  largely  Roman  Catholic  and  pro-life,  and  supports  a  strong \nmilitary. JA0858-60; JA0334; JA0359; JA0717; JA0722-23; JA1003; JA2269-\n70; JA2293-94. They testified that the Filipino community does not regularly \nsupport  candidates  preferred  by  the  Black  community,  who  are  typically \nDemocratic and lean progressive. JA0860. This testimony went unrebutted. \n6 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 17 of 65 Total Pages:(17 of 78)\n \nPortions  of  Virginia  Beach  are  represented  in  the  Virginia  House  of \nDelegates by Delegate Kelly Fowler, a Hispanic and Filipina, whose district is \nmajority white.

A Filipino, Ron Villanueva, \nwas previously elected to the City Council, JA1151, as was a Hispanic, Rita \nBellitto, JA1262.3 Plaintiffs presented no evidence that anyone  of Asian  or \nHispanic descent has ever lost a Virginia Beach election to a white candidate.4 \nThe district court’s findings show that members of the Asian communities \ngenerally enjoy a socio-economic status comparable with, if not better than, that \nof whites. Among  other things, “the City had overutilized Asian-American \nowned business” in public contracting. JA1268. “Asian students perform at the \nsame,  or  higher,  rate  compared  to  white  students,”  and  Asian  high-school \ngraduation rates are comparable with white rates. JA1249.

Procedural History \n1.  In November 2017, one Black Plaintiff, Latasha Holloway, filed a \npro se complaint in the Richmond Division of the Eastern District of Virginia \n \n3 The district court’s assertion that Defendants “offered no evidence of her \nethnicity,” JA1262, is clearly erroneous. See JA2638. \n4 One Filipina candidate, Kelly Fowler, defeated a Filipino, Ron Villanueva, in \na 2017 House of Delegates contest. \n7 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 18 of 65 Total Pages:(18 of 78)\n \nagainst  Virginia  Beach,  the  City  Council,  its  members,  and  other  officials \n(Defendants or the City) under Section 2 of the Act. The complaint made no \nmention of a multi-racial coalition. JA0037. On February 12, 2018, the case was \ntransferred to the Norfolk Division. JA0045. The case underwent a lengthy \nperiod of delay through a series of miscellaneous motions and an improper \ninterlocutory appeal. See JA0001-0036. \n2.  In November 2018, two Black candidates, Sabrina Wooten and \nAaron Rouse, prevailed in contested councilmanic races. Neither then knew of \nthis lawsuit, JA0506; JA2429, and there is no evidence that it impacted the \nelection. \nA week after the election, an amended complaint was filed, this time by \ncounsel  from  the  Campaign  Legal  Center  on  behalf  of  two  Black  voters, \nMs. Holloway and Georgia Allen. JA0049. The amended complaint alleged a \nnew  theory,  that  the  “current  at-large  scheme  impermissibly  denies  Black, \nHispanic or Latino, and Asian-American voters (“Minority Voters”) an equal \nopportunity to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of \ntheir choice.” JA0047. It alleged that the combined “Minority” population “is \nsufficiently numerous and geographically compact to form a majority of the total \npopulation and citizen voting age population in at least two single-member City \nCouncil districts in a demonstrative 10-district plan.” JA0055. No members of \nthe Asian or Hispanic communities joined the case, and Plaintiffs testified that \nthey made no effort to obtain such participation. JA0524; JA0171. \n8 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 19 of 65 Total Pages:(19 of 78)\n \nThe court (the Honorable Raymond A. Jackson, presiding) conducted a \nsix-day  bench  trial  in  October  2020.  At  trial,  Plaintiffs  presented  multiple \nalternative districting plans purporting to show that voting-age persons labeled \n“Minority” can constitute majorities in one or more single-member districts. \nJA1195-97. Additionally, Plaintiffs’ statistical expert, Dr. Spencer, overlaid the \nillustrative districts with past councilmanic election results and concluded the \ndistricts  would  improve  electoral  prospects  of  Black-preferred  candidates \nbecause, in his view, they would “likely…benefit from cross-over support from \nwhite voters.” JA1581. \nDr. Spencer also provided statistical estimates of racial and ethnic voting \npatterns, but did not estimate patterns of the Asian and Hispanic communities. \nRather, Dr. Spencer lumped Asian and Hispanic voters into an “All Minority” \ncategory, see, e.g., JA1578, that also included Black voters (who constitute by far \nthe largest of the three groups) and  other racial minorities (such as Native \nAmericans), JA443. Dr. Spencer testified that the Asian and Hispanic groups \nare too small and dispersed for purposes of estimating their voting preferences \nby  standard  means.  JA0439-40.  As  discussed  above,  unrebutted  qualitative \nevidence at trial showed divergent political preferences among Black, Asian, and \nHispanic groups. \n3.  In November 2020, Ms. Wooten was reelected to her councilmanic \nseat. (Mr. Rouse did not stand for election, due to the City’s staggered terms.) \nNo further elections are scheduled to occur until November 2022.  \n9 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 20 of 65 Total Pages:(20 of 78)\n \n On March 18, 2021, the Virginia General Assembly changed Virginia \nBeach’s electoral system, enacting Assembly House Bill 2198 (HB2198). The \nlegislation provided that, “in a city or town that imposes district-based or ward-\nbased residency requirements for members of the city or town council, the \nmember elected from each district or ward shall be elected by the qualified voters \nof that district or ward and not by the locality at large.” JA1139. Because seven \nof Virginia Beach’s districts are subject to a “residency requirement,” JA1150-\n51;  JA1154,  they  became  single-member  districts  as  of  January  1,  2022, \nHB2198’s  effective  date,  without  federal-court  intervention.  However,  by \noperation of the one-person, one-vote principle, the prior residency districts \nwould be malapportioned. As a result, the impact of HB2198 is to render the at-\nlarge scheme unusable and to require the City to redistrict. Further, another new \nlaw, the Virginia Voting Rights Act, subjects a new redistricting plan to a state-\nlevel preclearance procedure to ensure minority communities have an equal \nopportunity to elect their preferred candidates. Va. Code § 24.2-129. On March \n22, 2021, Defendants filed a notice of HB2198, asserting that the case was moot. \nJA1134. \n4.  On March 31, the district court released a 133-page opinion and \norder  finding  that  Virginia  Beach’s  at-large  system  violates  Section  2, \npermanently enjoining the City from future use of the at-large system, and \nforbidding it from otherwise violating Section 2. JA1277. In a footnote, the court \nfound that HB2198 does not moot the case. JA1147. The district court also \nconcluded, inter alia, that coalitional claims are cognizable under Section 2, \n10 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 21 of 65 Total Pages:(21 of 78)\n \nJA1189, that members of each constituency in an alleged coalition need not \nparticipate as plaintiffs, JA1227, and that Plaintiffs need not provide estimates \nof voting preferences of members of each constituency to prove their claim, \nJA1230-31. \n5.  The  City  appealed,  but  this  Court  held  the  appeal  in  abeyance \npending remedial proceedings  in the district court and final judgment. The \ndistrict court commenced remedial proceedings by receiving proposed remedial \nplans from the parties, and it subsequently appointed Dr. Bernard Grofman as \nspecial master. SJA215. On October 26, 2021, the district court provided the \nparties the report of Dr. Grofman. SJA220. Dr. Grofman’s report proposed a \nremedial redistricting plan and analysis concerning that plan and the liability \nissues  before  the  court.  Dr.  Grofman  concluded,  in  relevant  part,  that \n“separating out the voting behavior of each individual group in the composite \nminority  grouping  is,  for  all  practical  purposes,  impossible.”  SJA284.  That \nconclusion was materially identical to the opinion of the City’s remedial expert, \nDr. Lisa Handley, a renowned Voting Rights Act expert, that an expert “cannot \ndraw any conclusions about Asian or Hispanic voting preferences in Virginia \nBeach.” SJA108. Only by accepting the unsupported assumption that these \ngroups  should  be  combined  into  one  did  Dr.  Grofman  conclude  that  the \ncoalition is cohesive. See SJA290.  \nThe parties filed two rounds of briefing in response to the special master’s \nreport. The City argued that Dr. Grofman’s report confirmed that coalitional \ncohesion  has  not  been  established  and  that  the  court  should  dissolve  its \n11 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 22 of 65 Total Pages:(22 of 78)\n \ninjunction.  Dist.Ct.Dkt.283  at  2.  On  December 22,  2021,  the  district  court \nentered  an  order  adopting  the  remedial  plan,  as  revised,5  and  making \nsupplemental findings in an effort to bolster its liability ruling. SJA359-64. It \nentered final judgment, SJA364, and the City timely appealed, SJA365. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nI.  The district court erred in entertaining this case. \nFirst, the case is moot. The at-large system will never govern another \nelection, as HB2198 automatically shifts the City from at-large to single-member \nseats.  The  district  court  misread  that  enactment,  believing  the  City  may \nvoluntarily readopt at-large seats, but it cannot: the City lacks independent \nlegislative authority to amend its charter, which would have to be accomplished \nto eliminate the residency requirements that HB2198 transforms into single-\nmember districts. And any challenge to the new system must be adjudicated on \nits own merits, not on the merits of Plaintiffs’ evidence and arguments regarding \nthe at-large system. \nSecond, Plaintiffs, two Black voters, lack standing to assert a coalitional \nclaim dependent on the rights of Hispanic and Asian voters. The district court \nerroneously thought they need not assert those third-party rights, but prevailing \non a coalitional claim depends on the rights and interests of all constituencies of \nthe  coalition.  Members  of  the  Black  community  could  not  hope  to  win  a \n \n5 Dr. Grofman issued a revised plan in response to criticisms the City lodged \nagainst his initial proposal, which are not relevant to this appeal. SJA342. \n12 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 23 of 65 Total Pages:(23 of 78)\n \ncoalitional claim independent of the rights of other groups and therefore have \nno choice but to assert those rights, which Plaintiffs lack standing to do. \nII.  The decision below is also erroneous on the merits. Plaintiffs failed \nto prove that “a bloc voting majority [is]  usually…able to defeat candidates \nsupported by a politically cohesive, geographically insular minority group.” \nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 49 (1986). They did not plead or prove that the \nCity’s Black community is sufficiently large, compact, and insular to constitute \nthe majority of a single-member district, and the district court’s inexplicable \nfinding that they met this standard cannot stand. \nThe claim Plaintiffs did plead and attempt to prove, a coalitional claim on \nbehalf of the Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities lumped together, is not a \nlegally proper invocation of Section 2. The statute forbids inequality “on account \nof race or color,” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a), but constituencies in a coalition share, \nat  best,  political  interests.  And  the  statute’s  conceptual  dichotomy  between \n“members of a class”—singular—and “other members of the electorate”—white \nand non-white—undermines the dichotomy of a coalition, which places white \nvoters in one category and “All Minority” in another. The Act’s structure and \npurpose, guaranteeing the right of members of a protected class to “elect [their \npreferred] candidate based on their own votes and without  assistance from \nothers,” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 14 (2009), further undercuts any claim \nto coalitional relief. \nPlaintiffs also failed to establish coalitional cohesion, another threshold \nelement of a Section 2 claim. They presented no evidence—quantitative or \n13 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 24 of 65 Total Pages:(24 of 78)\n \nqualitative—of Hispanic and Asian voting patterns alone. Instead, Plaintiffs and \nthe  district  court  relied  solely  on  “All  Minority”  aggregate  estimates,  even \nthough the smaller Asian and Hispanic communities can easily be buried in the \nfar larger Black group and even though estimates showing Black preferences \nconsistently exceeded the “All Minority” preferences estimated for the same \ncandidates. This impermissibly attributed Black voting preferences to Asians \nand Hispanics. And the district court adhered to this approach even after its \nspecial  master  concluded  it  is  “mathematically  impossible”  to  estimate  the \n“voting behavior of each individual group.” SJA285. Moreover, the qualitative \nevidence, without rebuttal, established that the City’s largest Asian community \nprefers  conservative  candidates  and  does  not  vote  in  line  with  the  Black \ncommunity. The district court erred in applying a relaxed cohesion standard, \nwhere a stringent standard “quite obviously” applies. Growe, 507 U.S. at 40-41. \nThe  district  court  erred  further  in  concluding  that  white  bloc  voting \n“usually” defeats the minority-preferred candidate. Its own factfinding showed \na 50-50% split, with minority-preferred candidates successful half the time. The \ncourt erroneously discounted races where the minority-preferred candidate was \nwhite, in contravention of this Court’s precedent, and it erroneously discounted \nthe success of Black candidates after this case was filed, without identifying an \nimpact of this then-unknown lawsuit on those contests.  \nIII.  The district court’s injunction is an impermissibly vague obey-the-\nlaw injunction and does not “describe in reasonable detail…the act or acts \nrestrained  or  required.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65(d)(1)(C).  The  injunction \n14 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 25 of 65 Total Pages:(25 of 78)\n \nimpermissibly threatens with contempt a broad array of actions the City might \ntake, even unknowingly, and even actions the City merely implements at the \ncommand of the General Assembly. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n“Whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction is a question of \nlaw that [this Court] review[s] de novo,” Anita’s New Mexico Style Mexican Food, \nInc. v. Anita’s Mexican Foods Corp., 201 F.3d 314, 316 (4th Cir. 2000), as is the \nquestion whether Plaintiffs have (or need) third-party standing, see Corr v. Metro. \nWashington Airports Auth., 740 F.3d 295, 300 (4th Cir. 2014). The Court reviews \n“judgments resulting from a bench trial under a mixed standard of review: \nfactual findings may be reversed only if clearly erroneous, while conclusions of \nlaw are examined de novo.” Raleigh Wake Citizens Ass’n v.

Carolina v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 235 (4th Cir. 2014). \n15 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 26 of 65 Total Pages:(26 of 78)\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  The District Court Erred in Reaching the Merits \nA.  The Case Is Moot \nThis case became moot when HB2198 was enacted, because it ended the \nat-large system Plaintiffs challenged. JA1140; JA1146-47. “[S]tatutory changes \nthat discontinue a challenged practice are ‘usually enough to render a case \nmoot.’”  Valero  Terrestrial  Corp.  v.  Paige,  211  F.3d  112,  116  (4th  Cir.  2000) \n(citation omitted). This includes amendments that replace the challenged act \nwith “a significantly amended statutory scheme.” Esposito v. S.C. Coastal Council, \n939 F.2d 165, 171 (4th Cir. 1991).  \nHere, HB2198 transformed the challenged at-large system to a new system \ndominated by seven single-member districts (i.e., the seven residency districts), \nwhich  were  precleared  under  Section  5,  and  containing  only  three  at-large \ndistricts.  Because  Plaintiffs  challenged  an  “election  method,  in  which  all \ncouncilmembers are elected at-large in citywide elections,” JA0048 (emphasis \nadded), the legislative shift away from that system to one where each voter votes \nin a single-member district was not “minor and insignificant.” Valero, 211 F.3d \nat 116. It repealed the system challenged in this lawsuit.  The district court \nerroneously issued an advisory opinion in enjoining a system that will never be \nused again. See 11126 Baltimore Blvd. v. Prince George’s Cnty., 924 F.2d 557, 557 \n(4th Cir. 1991) (per curiam); Checker Cab Operators, Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cnty., 899 \nF.3d 908, 916 (11th Cir. 2018); Int’l Women’s Day Planning Comm. v. City of San \nAntonio, 619 F.3d 346, 357 (5th Cir. 2010). Further, even the existing residency \n16 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 27 of 65 Total Pages:(27 of 78)\n \ndistricts may not be used in future elections because the 2020 census results \nrenders them malapportioned and obsolete, and any new redistricting will be \nsubject to preclearance under the Virginia Voting Rights Act to ensure that the \nplan affords minority communities an equal opportunity to elect their preferred \ncandidates, Va. Code § 24.2-129. \nThe district court’s reasons for retaining jurisdiction lack merit. JA1147. \nFirst, the court invoked the voluntary-cessation doctrine, opining that “the law \nallows Defendants to eliminate the district residency requirements for the seven \nseats on the City Council and allows them to retain the at-large system of \nelection for those positions.” Not so. Virginia Beach’s residency districts are set \nforth in the City’s charter. Eliminating the residency requirement would require \nan amendment to that charter. But Virginia is a Dillon’s Rule jurisdiction, and \n“[o]nly the Virginia General Assembly can amend the city charter.” Simpson v. \nCity of Hampton, 166 F.R.D. 16, 17 (E.D. Va. 1996); Va. Code § 15.2-200; \nJA1151-52. “The ‘voluntary cessation’ exception to mootness has no play in this \ncase” because the elimination of the at-large system “was not voluntary” by the \nCity,  but  was  imposed  by  the  General  Assembly,  which  transformed  the \nresidency requirements (which only it can repeal) into single-member district \nthrough HB2198 (which only it can repeal). Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC, 636 F.3d 641, \n648 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Nor does the General Assembly’s theoretical ability to \nrepeal the newly enacted HB2198, or amend the City’s charter, breathe life into \nthis dead case. See Valero, 211 F.3d at 116. \n17 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 28 of 65 Total Pages:(28 of 78)\n \nSecond, the district court’s assertion that HB2198 “does not specifically \naddress Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claims of voter dilution” misses the effect of HB2198, \nwhich eliminates the “election method, in which all councilmembers are elected \nat-large in citywide elections.” JA0048. Plaintiffs sought relief from “Virginia \nBeach’s at-large method,” id., not a system with seven single-member districts \nsubject to state-law preclearance. Any challenge to the single-member-district \nsystem must be brought through a new action or amended complaint. N.Y. State \nRifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. City of New York, 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1526 (2020) (directing \nthat allegations that revised statute exhibited features of challenged statute be \nraised in a new action); Md. Highways Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Maryland, 933 F.2d \n1246, 1249-50 (4th Cir. 1991) (similar). And it must be brought after the City \nredraws the existing residency districts, and after preclearance review, because \nonly when that occurs may the effects of the new plan be evaluated. At a \nminimum, it was Plaintiffs’ burden to “adduce[] evidence” that the challenged \nfeatures of the at-large system have “not been substantially altered” in HB2198. \nNextel Partners Inc. v. Kingston Township, 286 F.3d 687, 693 (3d Cir. 2002). They \npresented no such evidence, see Dist.Ct.Dkt.241, and could not have, given how \ndifferent the new system is from the one they challenge and given that the new \nsystem has yet to take form. \nThird, the court doubly erred in announcing it could give “effectual relief” \nin the form of an injunction mandating “the implementation of an election \nsystem for the City Council that complies with Section 2 of the Voting Rights \nAct” and that “Virginia Beach comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act” \n18 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 29 of 65 Total Pages:(29 of 78)\n \nin “all future elections.” JA1147 (citations omitted). For one thing, without \nproof that the seven-member system is unlawful, “there neither has been a wrong \nnor can be a remedy.” Growe, 507 U.S. at 41 (emphasis added). For another thing, \nvague directives to comply with the law in the future are not available relief. See \nSection III, infra. The possibility of ordering a defendant to comply with law that \napplies regardless would, if deemed an exception to mootness, apply in every \ncase. \nB.  Plaintiffs Lack Third-Party Standing To Assert the Rights of All \nVirginia Beach “Minority” Residents \nThe district court also erred in permitting Plaintiffs to bring a Section 2 \n“coalition”  claim  on  behalf  of  all  “Minority”  residents  of  Virginia  Beach, \nincluding  members  of  the  Asian  and  Hispanic  communities.  The  court \nultimately concluded that “[t]wo or more politically cohesive minority groups \ncan bring a claim as a coalition under Section 2.” JA1181. But two or more \nminority groups did not bring this claim; two Black voters did. \nStanding  principles  incorporate  a  “general  prohibition  on  a  litigant’s \nraising  another  person’s  legal  rights.”  Lexmark  Int’l,  Inc.  v.  Static  Control \nComponents,  Inc.,  572  U.S.  118,  126  (2014)  (citation  omitted).  Unless  an \nexception applies, a plaintiff “must assert his own legal rights and interests, and \ncannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.” U.S. \nDep’t of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720 (1990) (citations omitted). The district \ncourt erred in permitting Plaintiffs to bring a coalitional claim predicated on the \nrights of non-party Asian and Hispanic voters, who were not even asked to join, \n19 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 30 of 65 Total Pages:(30 of 78)\n \nand who are “the best proponents of their own rights.” Singleton v. Wulff, 428 \nU.S. 106, 114 (1976). \nThe district court erroneously found no third-party standing problem at \nall, positing that “Plaintiffs’ personal legal interests have been injured” and that \nHispanic and Asian communities were relevant only insofar as Plaintiffs put on \n“statistical evidence that the votes of their community, and minority voters \ngenerally,  have  been  diluted.”6  JA0100.  That  is  legally  incorrect.  Plaintiffs’ \nassertions  concerning  the  Asian  and  Hispanic  communities  are  not  mere \ncircumstantial evidence of harm to Plaintiffs, but the coalitional claim itself. See \nNordgren v. Hafter, 789 F.2d 334, 338 (5th Cir. 1986) (holding that “a white \nJewish female…cannot successfully assert standing on behalf of aggrieved black \napplicants to the Mississippi bar. She is not their representative.”). \nThe rights of third parties are necessarily asserted in cases where a “litigant \nappears  in  court  and  seeks  to  challenge  the  validity  of  a  statute  or  other \ngovernmental  action,”  and  the  challenge  will  fail  “[i]f  validity  were  to  be \nmeasured solely in light of the litigant’s interests.” Charles A. Wright et al., Fed. \nPrac. & Proc., Juris. § 3531.9 (3d ed.). Here, members of the Black community \ncan prevail only by showing that Black voters “make up more than 50 percent \nof the voting-age population in the relevant geographic area.” Bartlett, 556 U.S. \nat 18. Plaintiffs did not plead this, they put on no evidence of it, and none could \n \n6 Indeed, Plaintiffs failed to put on statistical evidence about Asian and Hispanic \nvoting preferences. See Section II.B.1, infra. \n20 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 31 of 65 Total Pages:(31 of 78)\n \nhave been adduced. See Section II.A.1, infra. Only by also asserting the alleged \nrights of members of the Asian and Hispanic communities could a coalitional \nclaim succeed. See Nordgren, 789 F.2d at 338. Moreover, Plaintiffs would have \nno entitlement to “at least two single-member City Council districts” comprising \na majority of “minority population,” JA0055, without asserting the rights of \nmembers of the Asian and Hispanic communities. See I.N.S. v. Delgado, 466 U.S. \n210, 217 n.4 (1984). \nAlthough there are exceptions to the bar on asserting third parties’ rights, \nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 130 (2004), Plaintiffs below asserted that they \n“are not alleging third-party standing,” Dist.Ct.Dkt.156 at 27, and the district \ncourt agreed, JA0100. Any such invocation is therefore waived.  \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Section 2 Claim Fails on the Merits \nA Section 2 plaintiff must establish each of three preconditions set forth in \nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), known as the “Gingles preconditions”: \n(1) “the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large \nand  geographically  compact  to  constitute  a  majority  in  a  single-member \ndistrict,” (2) “the minority group must be able to show that it is politically \ncohesive,” and (3) “the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white \nmajority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it...usually to defeat the minority’s \npreferred candidate.” Id. at 50-51. “If these preconditions are met, the court must \nthen determine under the ‘totality of circumstances’ whether there has been a \nviolation of Section 2.” Lewis v. Alamance Cnty., 99 F.3d 600, 604 (4th Cir. 1996) \n(citation omitted). The district court erred at each step. \n21 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 32 of 65 Total Pages:(32 of 78)\n \nA.  The District Court Erred on the First Gingles Precondition \nA Section 2 plaintiff must establish at least that the relevant minority \ngroup constitutes “more than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the \nrelevant  geographic  area,”  Bartlett,  556  U.S.  at  18,  and  that  the  group  is \n“geographically compact,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50. \n1.  Plaintiffs Did Not Plead or Prove a Single-Race Claim \nThe district court clearly erred in its alternative conclusion that “Plaintiffs \nestablished  that  the  African  American  community  in  Virginia  Beach  is \nsufficiently  large  and  geographically  compact”  to  satisfy  the  first  Gingles \nprecondition. JA1209. Not only did Plaintiffs present no evidence of this, but \nthey did not even plead it, JA0060. The adjudication of an un-pleaded, untried \nclaim  contravened  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  15(b)(2),  see  Dan  Ryan \nBuilders, Inc. v. Crystal Ridge Dev., Inc., 783 F.3d 976, 983 (4th Cir. 2015), and \n“the principle of party presentation,” see United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. \nCt. 1575, 1579 (2020). \nThe finding also is clearly erroneous. The district court cited no evidence \nthat Black voters alone can constitute a majority in even one single-member \ndistrict. Its sole citation was to Table 1 of its opinion, JA1209, which did not \ninclude a single entry reflecting that Black voters, without Hispanic and Asian \nvoters, can constitute a majority of a compact, single-member district, JA1197. \nPlaintiffs  advanced  a  coalitional  claim  for  a  reason.  “The  impetus  for  two \nminority groups seeking to proceed as a coalition under Section 2 is apparently \n22 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 33 of 65 Total Pages:(33 of 78)\n \ntheir inability, as separate groups, to overcome the first Gingles threshold factor.” \nLULAC, 986 F.2d at 785 n.43.  \nThe remedial phase confirmed that a single-race claim is unavailable. Dr. \nGrofman concluded that only a combination of minority groups can satisfy the \n50%  minority  voting-age  population  threshold,  SJA235,  and  no  proposed \nremedial plans achieved a majority-Black district, SJA158-259 (special master \nfailing to achieve any Black district above 35% BVAP); see also SJA134 (similar \nfailing on Plaintiffs’ part). The district court failed to address this issue, SJA359, \ndespite receiving notice of the error, Dist.Ct.Dkt.283 at 9. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ Coalitional Claim Is Not Cognizable \nThe claim Plaintiffs did plead, a coalitional claim, is not a cognizable \ninvocation of Section 2. “Even the most cursory examination reveals that § 2 of \nthe Voting Rights Act does not mention minority coalitions, either expressly or \nconceptually.” Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1386. \na.  Section 2 forbids the “denial or abridgement of the right of any \ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” 52 U.S.C. \n§ 10301(a). But “[a] group tied by overlapping political agendas but not tied by \nthe same statutory disability is no more than a political alliance or coalition.” \nCampos v. City of Baytown, 849 F.2d 943, 945 (5th Cir. 1988) (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting  from  denial  of  rehearing  en  banc).  The  Act’s  “purpose  was  to \neliminate  racial  discrimination—not  to  foster  particular  political  coalitions.” \nLULAC, 986 F.2d at 785 n.43 (citation omitted). \n23 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 34 of 65 Total Pages:(34 of 78)\n \nIt is beyond serious dispute that Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics in Virginia \nBeach do not share a common identity of “race or color.” The district court \nfound that there are “important differences between and within the Minority \nCommunity.” JA1211. Those differences are important precisely because they \ngo to the lack of a common racial heritage and shared American experience. As \nthe district court found, Filipinos—the largest among Virginia Beach’s Asian \ncommunities—have congregated in Virginia Beach over the decades in large \npart due to the City’s “Naval presence.” JA1160. By and large, the Black and \nHispanic communities arrived and have grown in the region for different reasons \nand at different times. These dynamics are typical of coalitional claims. See \nJA1185 (quoting precedent allowing a coalitional claim even though “Blacks \nand Mexican-Americans are racially and culturally distinct” (citation omitted)). \nThe  court  dismissed  these  conceded  differences,  concluding  that \n“differences in race, color, or language” can be overcome if these persons are \n“politically  cohesive.”  JA1191  (emphasis  added).  But  this  reasoning  only \ndemonstrates the political, not racial, nature of the claim. In fact, the court—\nrelying on generic dictionary definitions—extended Section 2 protections to any \n“group sharing the same economic or social status,” JA1191 (footnote omitted), \nopining that “[m]utual political interests are present in any group seeking to elect a \nparticular candidate,” JA1194 (emphasis added). This interpretation strayed far \nfrom the statutory North Star “of race or color.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). \nb.  Other textual indicia in the Act foreclose coalitional claims. To \nbegin,  the  statute  “consistently  speaks  of  a  ‘class,’  in  the  singular,”  Nixon, \n24 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 35 of 65 Total Pages:(35 of 78)\n \n76 F.3d at 1386, and offers protection to “members of a class,” not classes. \n52 U.S.C.  § 10301(a).  “Had  Congress  chosen  explicitly  to  protect  minority \ncoalitions it could have done so by defining the ‘results’ test in terms of protected \nclasses of citizens. It did not.” LULAC, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d \n831, 894 (5th Cir. 1993) (“Clements”) (Jones, J., concurring). The district court \nmissed this point in focusing on the plural statutory term “members.” JA1191. \nBut those “members” must be “of a class”—singular; the statute reinforces this \nby  clarifying  that  “its  members”—members  of  the  singular  class—enjoy \nprotection. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b) (emphasis added); Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1386. \nMoreover,  the  district  court  overlooked  Section  2’s  comparative  test, \nwhich hinges on a showing that “members of a class” under “subsection (a)” \nhave “less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the \npolitical  process….”  52  U.S.C.  § 10301(b)  (emphasis  added).  This  contrast \nbetween “members of a class” and “other members of the electorate” places all \npersons not “of” the singular “class” in the basket of “other members of the \nelectorate.” The statute therefore contrasts Plaintiffs’ class of Black voters with \nAsian  and  Hispanic  voters,  who  are  just  as  much  “other  members  of  the \nelectorate” as are white voters. \nThe statutory definitions confirm this. Section 2 was amended in 1975 to \ninclude “language minorities,” 52 U.S.C. § 10303(f), a term Congress defined to \nmean “persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or \nof Spanish heritage,” 52 U.S.C. § 10310(c)(3); see Act of Aug. 6, 1975, Pub. \nL. 94-73,  §§ 203,  207,  89  Stat.  401-402.  “That  each  of  these  groups  was \n25 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 36 of 65 Total Pages:(36 of 78)\n \nseparately identified indicates that Congress considered members of each group \nand the group itself to possess homogeneous characteristics.” Clements, 999 F.2d \nat 894 (Jones, J., concurring). \nc.  That  statutory  meaning  flows  from  constitutional  limits  on \ncongressional power. “[T]he Voting Rights Act is premised upon congressional \n‘findings’ that each of the protected minorities is, or has been, the subject of \npervasive discrimination and exclusion from the electoral process.” Nixon, 76 \nF.3d at 1390. The scope of congressional findings limits the permissible scope of \nthe Act because these findings are necessary to Congress’s enforcement of the \nFifteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Johnson v. Governor of State of Fla., 405 F.3d 1214, \n1231 (11th Cir. 2005); Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 368 \n(2001). Congress made findings to support enacting Section 2 protections for \nBlack voters, see Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727 F.2d 364, 374-75 (5th Cir. 1984) \n(collecting findings), and for extending those protections to language minorities, \n52 U.S.C. § 10303(f)(1). But a “coalition of protected minorities is a group of \ncitizens  about  which  Congress  has  not  made  a  specific  finding  of \ndiscrimination.” Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1391. “To assume…that a group composed \nof both minorities,” or several, “is itself a protected minority is an unwarranted \nextension of congressional intent,” Campos, 849 F.2d at 945 (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), and congressional authority, see \nCity of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 519 (1997). \nd.  Coalitional  claims  also  conflict  with  the  statutory  scheme  and \npurpose. For one thing, “a coalition theory could just as easily be advanced as a \n26 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 37 of 65 Total Pages:(37 of 78)\n \ndefense in Voting Rights Act cases, a position that courts would be logically \nbound to accept if plaintiff coalitions were allowed, yet a position at odds with \ncongressional purpose.” Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1391. The theory would empower \njurisdictions to create dilutive coalitional districts to defend itself from a claim \nfor majority-minority districts. See Campos, 849 F.2d at 944-46 (Higginbotham, \nJ.,  dissenting  from  denial  of  rehearing  en  banc).  And  coalition  claims  are \n“fraught with risks,” as members of one group may bring them to “increase their \nopportunity to participate in the political process at the expense of members of \nthe other minority group.” LULAC, 986 F.2d at 785 n.43. Moreover, allowing \nsome groups (not all) “to further their mutual political goals” hijacks Section 2 \nfor partisan ends. Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1392. A major political party that enjoys \nsubstantial support from certain racial groups can claim a Section 2 right to a \ndistricting  scheme  that  favors  that  party’s  interests,  coopting  these  groups’ \nminority status for partisan advantage. If allowed, this would empower partisan \ninterests to politicize the Act in ways that will ultimately undermine, rather than \nfurther, congressional purpose and the integrity of the Act. \ne.  Coalition claims are untenable for the same reasons the Supreme \nCourt rejected crossover claims—i.e., claims asserting the right of a minority \ngroup to districts in which its members join with whites to elect their shared \npreferred candidates. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13-25. Bartlett read the Act to reach \n“African-Americans standing alone,” i.e., to “elect [their preferred] candidate \nbased on their own votes and without assistance from others.” Id. at 14. The \nCourt explained: “Nothing in § 2 grants special protection to a minority group’s \n27 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 38 of 65 Total Pages:(38 of 78)\n \nright to form political coalitions.” Id. at 15; see also id. at 20 (“The statute does \nnot protect any possible opportunity or mechanism through which minority \nvoters could work with other constituencies to elect their candidate of choice.”). \nSo too here. The Court also explained that Section 2 case law “does not impose \non those who draw election districts a duty to give minority voters the most \npotential,  or  the  best  potential,  to  elect  a  candidate  by  attracting  crossover \nvoters.” Id. Section 2 protects a racial group’s opportunity to make its “own \nchoice,” and “[t]here is a difference between a racial minority group’s ‘own \nchoice’ and the choice made by a [crossover] coalition” of white and Black \nvoters. Id. The coalitional problem is no different. \nThis Court’s decision in Hall anticipated Bartlett’s holding and reasoning, \nincluding the view that members of a minority group must “have the potential \nto elect a candidate on the strength of their own ballots” before claiming Section 2 \nprotection. Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421, 429 (4th Cir. 2004). Indeed, Bartlett \nquoted Hall for the proposition that the Act does not “grant minority voters ‘a \nright to preserve their strength for the purposes of forging an advantageous \npolitical alliance.’” 556 U.S. at 14-15 (quoting 385 F.3d at 431). That reasoning \nequally precludes coalitional claims. \nSo too does Bartlett’s concern “for workable standards and sound judicial \nand legislative administration.” Id. at 17. “Determining whether a § 2 claim \nwould  lie—i.e.,  determining  whether  potential  districts  could  function  as \ncrossover districts—would place courts in the untenable position of predicting \nmany  political  variables  and  tying  them  to  race-based  assumptions.”  Id. \n28 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 39 of 65 Total Pages:(39 of 78)\n \nCoalitional claims fare even worse, requiring (in the district court’s words) \ncourts to make findings on “the complex intersectional ways in which citizens \nidentify as minorities.” JA1192. That amorphous concept cannot be reduced \ninto cognizable, and consistently applied, legal judgments. And it is impossible \nto  leave  even  white  voters  out  of  the  calculus:  here,  Plaintiffs’  proposed \nalternative districts were projected to perform only because of anticipated “cross-\nover support from white voters.” JA1581 (emphasis added). \nHence, Bartlett’s concern that reading crossover claims into  Section 2 \nwould likely render it unconstitutional applies with equal force here. 556 U.S. \nat 21. Bartlett observed that a Section 2 crossover-district requirement would \ngreatly increase the use of racial classifications and “unnecessarily infuse race \ninto virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional questions.” Id. \n(citation omitted). If that is so with two races (white and Black) it is all the more \nso with several. In this case, there are three “Minority” groups; in the next, there \ncould  be  five  or  seven.  The  redistricting  authorities  forced  to  consider  the \ninnumerable possible coalitions that might exist in their jurisdictions would be \noverwhelmed with racial considerations.  \n“That interpretation would result in a substantial increase in the number \nof mandatory districts drawn with race as ‘the predominant factor motivating \nthe legislature’s decision.’” Id. at 21-22 (quoting Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, \n916  (1995)).  The  flawed  assumption  “that  members  of  the  same  racial \ngroup…think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same \ncandidates at the polls,” Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 647 (1993), fares worse \n29 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 40 of 65 Total Pages:(40 of 78)\n \nwhen applied generically across “Minority” groups, simply because they are not \nwhite. \nf.  The decisions recognizing coalitional claims are not sound and do \nnot merit the Court’s adherence. They provide precious little analysis, frequently \nbypassing the predicate statutory question in favor of case-specific analysis. See, \ne.g., Bridgeport Coal. For Fair Representation v. City of Bridgeport, 26 F.3d 271, 275-\n76 (2d Cir.), vacated sub nom. City of Bridgeport, Conn. v. Bridgeport Coal. For Fair \nRepresentation, 512 U.S. 1283 (1994); LULAC, Council No. 4386 v. Midland Indep. \nSch. Dist., 812 F.2d 1494, 1498-1502 (5th Cir.), vacated, 829 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. \n1987). One leading case found coalitional claims viable simply because the Act \ndoes not expressly prohibit them, see Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240, \n1244 (5th Cir. 1988), an approach that has drawn cogent criticism, Clements, 999 \nF.2d at 895 (Jones, J., concurring) (“The proper question is whether Congress \nintended to protect coalitions.”). Other decisions assumed that coalitional claims \nare authorized under the Act but rejected them on the merits, without discussing \nthe anterior legal question. See Concerned Citizens of Hardee Cnty. v. Hardee Cnty. \nBd. of Comm’rs, 906 F.2d 524, 526-27 (11th Cir. 1990); Badillo v. City of Stockton, \n956 F.2d 884, 890 (9th Cir. 1992), as amended (Apr. 27, 1992). Another court \nsimply chose to “remain faithful to the reasoning of the majority of the circuit \nand district courts which have considered the issue,” Huot v. City of Lowell, 280 \nF. Supp. 3d 228, 236 (D. Mass. 2017), notwithstanding that the “majority” of \ncourts have offered little “reasoning” for their rulings. \n30 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 41 of 65 Total Pages:(41 of 78)\n \nB.  The District Court Erred on the Second Gingles Precondition \nThe  second  Gingles  precondition  requires  proof  that  members  of  the \nrelevant minority group “constitute a politically cohesive unit.” Gingles, 478 U.S. \nat 56. “If the minority group is not politically cohesive, it cannot be said that the \nselection of [an at-large] electoral structure thwarts distinctive minority group \ninterests.” Id. at 51. Accordingly, “minority-group political cohesion never can \nbe assumed, but specifically must be proved in each case in order to establish \nthat a redistricting plan dilutes minority voting strength in violation of § 2.” \nShaw, 509 U.S. at 653 (citing Growe, 507 U.S. at 40-41). \n1.  The  District  Court  Erroneously  Applied  a  Relaxed \nCohesion Standard \nThe  district  court  applied  an  untenable  cohesion  standard.  Even  if \ncoalitional claims are viable, the standard of cohesion must be strict. In Growe, \nthe Supreme Court declined to decide whether coalitional claims are cognizable, \nbut held that, if they are, “there [is] quite obviously a higher-than-usual need for \nthe second of the Gingles showings.” 507 U.S. at 41. The Court held that, “when \ndilution of the power of such an agglomerated political bloc is the basis for an \nalleged violation, proof of minority political cohesion is all the more essential.” \nId.  \nCourts that have recognized coalitional claims have required a showing \nthat each group in the coalition is internally cohesive and that each group is \ncohesive with the others. As the Fifth Circuit explained:  \n[T]he  determinative  question  is  whether  black-\nsupported candidates receive a majority of the Hispanic \n31 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 42 of 65 Total Pages:(42 of 78)\n \nand  Asian  vote;  whether  Hispanic-supported \ncandidates receive a majority of the black and Asian \nvote; and whether Asian-supported candidates receive \na  majority  of  the  black  and  Hispanic  vote  in  most \ninstances in the [relevant] area. \nBrewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 1989). This is the only plausible \nstandard. Any other approach would undermine the coalitional theory that \nmembers of each group in the coalition suffer dilution of their own votes. To \naggregate  groups  is  to  attribute  preferences  of  one  to  the  others,  thereby \nassuming the cohesion conclusion that must be proven. Aggregation also creates \nan unacceptable risk, even a likelihood, that the coalition is not a coalition at all, \nbut rather a large amalgamation of different, dissimilar groups the preferences \nof whose larger elements are improperly attributed to the smaller elements. See \nBernard Grofman, Voting Rights in a Multi-Ethnic World, 13 Chicano-Latino L. \nRev. 15, 23 (1993). Only by requiring proof that each alleged group of the \nputative coalition satisfies the Section 2 standard independently, as well as with \nthe other alleged groups, can a court justify a finding that a coalition even exists. \n  Other precedents hold that cohesion must be established for each group in \nan alleged coalition. See, e.g., Concerned Citizens of Hardee Cnty., 906 F.2d at 526-\n527 (rejecting coalitional claim where plaintiffs failed to prove cohesion between \nBlack and Hispanic groups in the coalition); Campos, 840 F.2d at 1245 (“[I]f one \npart of the group cannot be expected to vote with the other part, the combination \nis not cohesive.”); Badillo, 956 F.2d at 891 (district court “found that plaintiffs’ \ntestimony...failed to prove that blacks and Hispanics were politically cohesive, \neither when combined or when considered separately”); Huot, 280 F. Supp. 3d \n32 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 43 of 65 Total Pages:(43 of 78)\n \nat 235-36 (requiring plaintiffs to show cohesive coalition among the member \ngroups in the coalition).  \nIt is undisputed that Plaintiffs failed under this test. Their expert did not \nseparately  estimate  candidate-preference  levels  for  each  constituent  group. \nPlaintiffs’ expert lumped all groups into an “All Minority” category and reported \nestimates of voting behavior attributed to that entire aggregate group. These \naggregate datapoints prove nothing about the preferences of the three constituent \ngroups, leaving Plaintiffs unable to show that a majority of Asian and Hispanic \nvoters  prefer  the  same  candidates,  and  that  those  are  the  same  candidates \npreferred by Black voters. \nThe district court found a Section 2 violation only by applying a relaxed \nstandard at the liability phase and effectively rejected Brewer’s standard in its \nfinal order. \na.  Plaintiffs’ Liability-Stage Failure \nA central evidentiary problem is that, due to the small size and geographic \ndispersion  of  the  City’s  Hispanic  and  Asian  communities,  the  statistical \ntechniques  employed  in  this  case  cannot  estimate  the  Hispanic  and  Asian \ncommunities’ respective voting patterns. See, e.g., JA0439 (Dr. Spencer); SJA284 \n(Dr. Grofman). Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Spencer, attempted to bypass this problem \nby creating an aggregate “All Minority” estimate and performed his statistical \nanalysis  on that aggregate number, along with the Black community alone \n(which is large enough to individually estimate). Where Dr. Spencer saw high \n33 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 44 of 65 Total Pages:(44 of 78)\n \nlevels of this aggregate group support the same candidate, he viewed this as \nevidence of cohesion. \nThe problem with lumping the three distinct minority groups together is \nrevealed  by  Dr.  Spencer’s  own  analysis,  which  improperly  attributes  Black \nvoting  preferences  to  Asians  and  Hispanics.  His  estimates  of  Black  voting \npreferences  were  consistently  higher  (i.e.,  more  cohesive)  than  the  “All \nMinority” numbers. Consider the 2016 Kempsville race, where Dr. Spencer \nestimated  Black  support  for  candidate  Ross-Hammond  at  76.8%  and  “All \nMinority” support at 59.9%. JA0457-58; JA1565. Using algebra and the relative \nsizes of Virginia Beach’s Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities, Defendants’ \nexpert estimated only 34.3% of the Asian and Hispanic component of the “All \nMinority” number supported Ross-Hammond. JA2271. Dr. Spencer did not \ndispute this calculation, JA0467, and conceded it was possible this meant the \ncoalition  is  not  cohesive.  JA0468.  And,  whether  or  not  that  estimate  is \nprobative, it is indisputable that voting choices of Asians or Hispanics (or both) \ndragged the average down.  \nThis phenomenon existed across the board. These are the races involving \na Black candidate that the district court relied on (JA1218-21) and Dr. Spencer’s \nestimated support for the Black candidate: \n34 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 45 of 65 Total Pages:(45 of 78)\n \nContest/  All Minority7  Black  Asian  Hispanic \nMeasured Candidate  Support for  Support for  Support  Support \nCandidate8  Candidate9   (?)

And, because the Black community is much \nlarger  than  the  Asian  and  Hispanic  Asian  communities,  the  true  Asian  or \nHispanic support (or both) must be far below the All Minority average. \nFurther, there is no way to know whether the Asian and Hispanic groups \nare internally cohesive. The above-stated estimates are consistent with the Asian \nor Hispanic communities, or both, having no consistent pattern of voting for or \nagainst the same candidates. There is also no way to assess cohesion between \nmembers  of  the  Hispanic  and  Asian  contingencies.  Because  Black  voters \nsignificantly outnumber Asian and Hispanic voters, a wide range of outcomes is \nconsistent with Dr. Spencer’s estimates. \nb.  The  District  Court’s  Liability  Opinion  Makes \nMathematically Impossible Assumptions \ni.  The district court’s liability opinion did not address  Brewer and, \ninstead, “twisted the burden of proof beyond recognition.” Abbott v. Perez, 138 \nS. Ct. 2305, 2333 (2018). It opined that Defendants’ expert was not properly \nqualified to opine on “quantitative statistical methods,” JA1228, and that he \n“cannot disprove that Hispanics, Asians, and Blacks vote cohesively.” JA1229 \n(emphasis added). But “plaintiffs must prove” cohesion. Growe, 507 U.S. at 42 \n(citation omitted). It was error to require Defendants to disprove it. \nWhat  matters  is  that  cohesion  was  not  proven.  The  district  court \nacknowledged that relying on a single aggregate “All Minority” point estimate \nmeans that “high Black support for a given candidate  could mask far lower \nsupport—or even opposition—from Asian and Hispanic voters.” JA1227. Dr. \n36 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 47 of 65 Total Pages:(47 of 78)\n \nSpencer, too, admitted that this scenario is “one possible explanation” for his \nestimates. JA0377. Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Allan Lichtman likewise conceded that \n“we don’t have information...on the individual  behavior of” the Asian and \nHispanic groups, and “[b]eyond that, we can’t go.” JA1910. All of this admitted \nthat Plaintiffs’ elaborate presentation fall short of proving cohesion, which is \nwhat the law requires. Growe, 507 U.S. at 42 (citation omitted). \nii.  The district court also rewrote the standard of cohesion, concluding \nthat  less  than  majority  support  from  minority  voters  can  prove  cohesion. \nJA1230. As an initial matter, that is beside the point, because Plaintiffs proved \nnothing about Hispanic and Asian support levels. Whether 50% support was \nrequired, or something lower would suffice, is an academic question. \nAnd the district court was legally wrong. This Court explained in Levy v. \nLexington County, 589 F.3d 708 (4th Cir. 2009), that the failure of an alleged \nminority-preferred candidate to achieve “50 percent of the minority vote” would \n“demonstrate a lack of political cohesiveness.” Id. at 720 n.18. That stands to \nreason:  if  more  members  of  a  group  oppose  the  candidate  than  support  that \ncandidate,  then  the  group  cannot  plausibly  be  called  cohesive  around  that \ncandidate. See Levy v. Lexington Cnty., Sch. Dist. Three Bd. of Trustees, 2012 WL \n1229511, at *3 (D.S.C. Apr. 12, 2012), as amended (Apr. 18, 2012). And, because \neven bare-majority support is hardly probative of cohesion, courts usually apply \na 60% standard. Rodriguez v. Pataki, 308 F. Supp. 2d 346, 388-90 (S.D.N.Y. \n2004); Smith v. Bd. of Supervisors, 801 F. Supp. 1513, 1522 n.11 (E.D. Va. 1992), \nrev’d on other grounds, Smith v. Bd. of Supervisors, 984 F.2d 1393 (4th Cir. 1993). \n37 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 48 of 65 Total Pages:(48 of 78)\n \nThe district court founded its contrary view on Lewis v. Alamance County, \n99 F.3d 600, 613 n.10 (4th Cir. 1996), but the relevant portion of that decision \naddressed  the  third  Gingles  precondition,  “whether  minority-preferred \ncandidates  are  ‘usually’  defeated”  by  white  bloc  voting  (often  called \n“polarization”). Id. at 608. As Levy explains, a candidate may receive less than \n50% of the minority vote in a multi-candidate race to be the “candidate of \nchoice” under the third precondition, 589 F.3d at 716-18, but less than 50% \nsupport cuts against cohesion under the second precondition, id. at 720 n.18. \nCohesion (Gingles two) and polarization (Gingles three) are distinct. See id. at 720 \n(faulting  a  district  court  for  failing  to  “recognize[]  this  distinction”).  “For \nexample, the black population of a district may vote in a racially polarized \nmanner [for purposes of Gingles three] so as to overwhelmingly favor black \ncandidates, but the group may lack political cohesion [for purposes of Gingles \ntwo] if it splits its vote among several different black candidates for the same \noffice.” Monroe v. City of Woodville, 881 F.2d 1327, 1331 (5th Cir. 1989),  as \ncorrected, 897 F.2d 763 (5th Cir. 1990). Nothing less than 50%, if not 60%, proven \nsupport would be evidence of cohesion; anything less would be evidence against \ncohesion. \niii.  Next, the district court tried to transform Plaintiffs’ legal failing into \na  fact  issue  by  crediting  Plaintiffs’  expert’s  effort  “to  address  his  own \nlimitations.”  JA1230.  The  district  court  “recognize[d]  that  Plaintiffs’ \nmethodology  for  estimating  voter  cohesion  among  Minority  Community  is \nlimited” but did “not find that the methodology is flawed.” JA1231. But, flawed \n38 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 49 of 65 Total Pages:(49 of 78)\n \nor not, the methodology’s limits are dispositive because they leave the method \nunable to prove coalitional cohesion. \nPut simply, those limits left the court unable to identify a single estimate \nof Asian or Hispanic preference for any candidate in any race. Because Plaintiffs \nhad to prove that each constituency is internally cohesive standing alone, no \namount of explaining away arithmetic, even if creditable, could overcome the \nabsence of estimates. That problem is especially glaring when two parts of the \npurported tripartite coalition are total unknowns. Even assuming All Minority \nsupport were shown to match Black support, this would not show cohesion of \nthe Asian or Hispanic communities: Asian support could be vanishingly small \nif Hispanic support is strong (or vice versa). This failing is all the more glaring \ngiven that this Court has expressed skepticism of statistical estimation methods \nused by Dr. Spencer even for single-race claims, see Lewis, 99 F.3d at 604 n.3, \nand  given  that  Dr.  Spencer  grouped  all  non-white  persons  into  his  “All \nMinority”  category,  including  Native  Americans  and  others  not  alleged  to \nbelong to the tripartite coalition and whose impact on the analysis is unknown. \niv.  Dr.  Spencer’s  effort  to  “address  his  own  limitations”  did  not \novercome them. The district court credited a bizarre improvisational courtroom \nsession where, on an easel, Dr. Spencer scrawled a new expert report consisting \nof scribbled lines. JA2307. This last-ditch attempt only further undermined his \ncase. \nDr.  Spencer  performed  his  original  statistical  analysis  using  three \nmethods—Ecological  Regression  (ER),  Ecological  Inference  (EI),  and \n39 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 50 of 65 Total Pages:(50 of 78)\n \nHomogeneous Precinct Analysis (HP). At trial, he challenged for the first time \nthe assumption of linearity underlying his own ER datapoints, testifying that ER \n“requires you to draw a straight line through the data” but that “it could be the \ncase that the actual support” levels might involve a “deviation from linearness.” \nJA0380-81.  Dr.  Spencer  described  through  the  scribbled  charts  three \npossibilities—one preserving the linearity assumption and two that challenged \nthe assumption underlying his analysis. JA2307. For two of those possibilities, \nDr. Spencer conceded that where “All Minority” support levels were lower than \nBlack-only  support  levels,  it  meant  Asian  and  Hispanic  voters  supported \ncandidates at lower rates than Black voters. JA0380 (first); JA0382 (third). In \nthe final possibility, Dr. Spencer posited that his own estimated “All Minority” \nsupport levels might be understated and, in fact, “All Minority” support could be \nhigher than Black support. JA0381. Stated differently, Dr. Spencer testified that \nhis ER datapoints might be wrong and then made the assumption that that error \nworked in Plaintiffs’ favor.  \nThe problems here are obvious. First, Dr. Spencer still could not proffer \nan estimate of Asian or Hispanic voting preferences for even a single election. \nThat failing alone renders the episode, whatever its academic value, irrelevant. \nMoreover, crediting this untested methodology was clear error. As shown, \nDr. Spencer’s improvised abandonment of linearity would yield three possible \noutcomes, and two cut against “Minority” cohesion. Dr. Spencer’s choice to \nprefer the third was arbitrary—he based it on his own “eyeball test[]” and a \nposition that his ER estimates might be understated because the data did not fit \n40 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 51 of 65 Total Pages:(51 of 78)\n \nhis  straight-line  model  but  rather  featured  a  “scooping,”  curvilinear  shape. \nJA0381; JA0383; JA0390; JA0392. But, because the ER method is bound by the \nassumption of linearity, as Dr. Spencer admitted, JA0380, abandoning that \nassumption calls all of his estimates into question—including the estimate of \nBlack cohesion. JA1040. \nYet another problem is that Dr. Spencer’s attack on his own estimates \napplied only to ER. JA0380. But (as noted) Dr. Spencer also used EI, which \nresolves  the  very  problem  he  sought  to  cure  because  it  is  not  bound  by  an \nassumption of linearity and thus accounted for non-linear possibilities. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. City of Eastpointe, 378 F. Supp. 3d 589, 597 (E.D. Mich. 2019) \n(“But unlike ecological regression, ecological inference  does not rely on an \nassumption of linearity and instead incorporates ‘maximum likelihood statistics’ \nand the ‘bounds method’ to produce estimates of voting patterns by race.” \n(underlining added)); Cisneros v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist., 2014 WL 1668500, at \n*10 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 25, 2014) (same); Alabama NAACP v. Alabama, 2020 WL \n583803, at *30 (M.D. Ala. Feb. 5, 2020) (same); Rodriguez v. Harris Cnty., 964 F. \nSupp. 2d 686, 759 (S.D. Tex. 2013) (same). All the estimates shown in the table \nabove are EI estimates; all show All Minority support lagging behind Black \nsupport; and none is even touched by the district court’s statement on “non-\nlinear ‘LOESS’ curves.’” JA1230. \n41 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 52 of 65 Total Pages:(52 of 78)\n \nc.  The  Remedial  Record  Undermines  the  Liability \nRuling \ni.  The  remedial  record  confirmed  Plaintiffs’  failure  to  establish \ncoalitional cohesion. Dr. Grofman’s report determined that it is impossible to \nestimate voting patterns of the Asian and Hispanic communities in Virginia \nBeach. Dr. Grofman devoted Appendix B of his report to explaining why he \nregards “it as essentially mathematically impossible, given the data limitations \nin  this  case,  to  reliably  estimate  voting  behavior  for  each  [racial]  group \nseparately.” SJA284-85. He concluded that he could not “regard any inferences \nabout how the three minority groups voted as individual groups, whether made \nby an expert for Plaintiffs or an expert for Defendants, to be sufficiently well \nsupported  for  me  to  make  any  use  of  them  in  my  own  analyses.”  Id.  Dr. \nSpencer’s  ruminations  about  “linearity”  were  exposed  yet  again  as  bald \nspeculation, were that not already obvious. \nTo be sure, Dr. Grofman opined that the “All Minority” group combined \nexhibits cohesion, but, as explained, that type of analysis is insufficient. Dr. \nGrofman used the “All Minority” number only because (1) he (mistakenly) \nthought that a combined Black-Asian-Hispanic coalition was the “voting rights \ngroup which brought this lawsuit,” (2) it was the “voting group whose voting \nbehavior [the court] asked” him to analyze, (3) it was the only “voting rights \ncommunity” large and compact enough to meet the 50% CVAP test for a Section \n2 claim, and (4) because he did “not believe that it is statistically possible to \n42 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 53 of 65 Total Pages:(53 of 78)\n \ndetermine  the  voting  behavior  of  African-American,  Asian-American,  and \nHispanic populations individually.” SJA235.  \nii.  The district court should have dissolved its injunction as any further \nreliance on mathematically impossible assumptions became untenable. That is \nthe result contemplated by Wright v. Sumter Cnty. Bd. of Elections & Registration, \n979 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2020)—which Plaintiffs cited as the justification for \nholding the City’s appeal in abeyance pending final judgment. Wright held that \nremedial-phase evidence bears upon the question of liability in a Section 2 case, \nsince “the issue of remedy is part of the plaintiff’s prima facie case” and the \ncourt’s “inquiries into remedy and liability cannot be separated.” Id. at 1302-03 \n(citations omitted). This principle means that remedial proceedings may either \nbolster or undermine the liability ruling, depending on how the remedial record \ndevelops. Id. (discussing Dillard v. Baldwin Cnty. Commr’s, 376 F.3d 1260, 1266 \n(11th Cir. 2004), where a district court was “precluded from finding an ongoing \nsection  2  violation”  because  the  remedial  record  undermined  its  liability \nfinding)).  Because  the  remedial  record  revealed  that  the  liability  decision \ndepended on “mathematically impossible” assumptions, the district court was \nduty bound to vacate it. \nBut the district court doubled down. The court effectively rejected the \nstandard recognized in Brewer by expressly relieving Plaintiffs of the burden to \nprove cohesion as to each constituent group of the alleged coalition. SJA359-63. \nThe court concluded that Brewer did not mean what it said when it set that \nrequirement. Id. The district court pointed to language in Brewer reaffirming that, \n43 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 54 of 65 Total Pages:(54 of 78)\n \nin the Fifth Circuit, “minority groups may be aggregated” for Section 2 claims. \nId. (quoting Brewer, 876 F.2d at 453). But this language in Brewer referred to the \nlegal viability of coalitional claims, not to the standard of proof for cohesion. See \nBrewer, 876 F.2d at 453. Brewer made clear that the “determinative” cohesion \nquestion turns on evidence of each group separately and all groups together. Id. \nDespite that, the district court asserted that it conducted the “very inquiry” \ncalled for by Brewer. SJA362-63. Clearly, it did not. \nThe  district  court  also  credited  Dr.  Grofman’s  conclusion  that  the \naggregated “All Minority” group is cohesive, but Dr. Grofman offered that \nconclusion based on the court’s flawed legal premise that disaggregation  is \nunnecessary. Dr. Grofman’s conclusion on “All Minority” cohesion “taken \ntogether,”  SJA362,  is  no  different  from  concluding  that  Republicans  and \nDemocrats  are  cohesive  around  Democratic  candidates  in  Cleveland  or \nRepublican candidates in rural Alabama because taken together voters in these \nregions exhibit these preferences. That logic fails here for the same reason it fails \nthere. \n2.  Qualitative Evidence Disproved Cohesion \nTellingly,  the  district  court  expressed  little  confidence  in  the  expert \nestimates of voting behavior and instead commenced its discussion of cohesion \nwith  “qualitative  evidence.”  JA1211.  This  discussion,  too,  was  legally  and \nfactually erroneous. \nThe only evidence at trial of shared political advocacy related to a 20-year-\nold  effort  to  support  residency-based  districts  for  City  Council.  The  court \n44 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 55 of 65 Total Pages:(55 of 78)\n \ncredited testimony by Ron Villanueva and Nonato Abrajano, both of Filipino \ndescent,  during  a  2001  public  hearing  that  they  supported  district-based \nelections, JA1275 (citing JA1290-96), but ignored contemporaneous testimony \nby the same witnesses clearly limiting that political cooperation, JA1292-93 \n(Villanueva and Abrajano stating that this was the “first time” the minority \ncommunities came together with a political proposal); JA0853-54 (Abrajano \ntestifying that the Filipino-American Community Action Group did not support \neither of the Black candidates in the 2002 at-large City Council race). This \ntestimony  is  consistent  with  Plaintiff  Georgia  Allen’s  testimony  that  these \nmoments of joint advocacy were fleeting, related to a “specific issue,” and then \nthe groups would “disperse and go about our business.” JA0190-91. \nAll other examples of “cohesion” the court identified were testimony by \nmembers of the Black community about general efforts to support minority \ncommunities. An exchange between the court and Plaintiffs’ witness reveals the \nlack of anything suggesting voting cohesion: \nTHE COURT: During your 30 years, has there been a \nconsistent  interaction  between  African-Americans, \nFilipinos, and Asians with respect to matters of interest \nto the groups?  \nTHE WITNESS: I only know about the economic one \nthat is a consistent one, in terms of asking for more \nequity as far as contracts are concerned, because that’s \nwhat my business was.  \nJA0579. \n45 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 56 of 65 Total Pages:(56 of 78)\n \nThe district court cited not one item of qualitative evidence suggesting that \nlarge numbers of Asian, Hispanic, and Black voters “prefer certain candidates \nwhom they could elect in a single-member, [HBA] majority district.” Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 68. In fact, the evidence overtly undercut any such finding. All \nqualitative testimony on voting patterns, lay and expert, was to the effect that \nthe  large  Filipino  community  “has  historically  been  more  conservative/ \nRepublican in its orientation.” JA1003; JA2269-70; JA2293-94. All Asian and \nHispanic witnesses at trial testified that members of the largest Asian population \nin  Virginia  Beach—the  Filipino  community—were  decidedly  conservative. \nJA0322 (Del. Fowler testifying that Filipino-Americans voted Republican and \nany vote for her—a Democrat—would be a “crossover” vote). \nThe court’s reference to “shared political advocacy,” even if it existed, has \nno logical relation to vote dilution in an at-large system, which turns on lack of \n“ability to elect representatives of…choice.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51. None of the \nevidence the court cited establishes that “a significant number of minority group \nmembers usually vote for the same candidates.” Levy, 589 F.3d at 719-20. Just \nas “courts should not hastily assume that cooperation among minority groups \nin filing a Section 2 complaint will inevitably lead to a finding of political \ncohesion in their actual electoral practices,” Brewer, 876 F.2d at 454, they should \nnot assume that groups that do not cooperate to file a Section 2 complaint, but \nmay arguably engage in some common political activism, vote for the same \ncandidates—especially when direct testimony is to the contrary. The question \nremains whether the groups “vote together,” and evidence of that must be shown \n46 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 57 of 65 Total Pages:(57 of 78)\n \n“by some sort of reliable” means. Id. (citation omitted). Because that was not \nproven, the claim should have been rejected. \nC.  The District Court Erred on the Third Gingles Precondition \nThe third Gingles precondition requires a Section 2 plaintiff to prove that \nthe “bloc voting majority must usually be able to defeat candidates supported by \na politically cohesive, geographically insular minority group.” Gingles, 478 U.S. \nat 49. The district court’s findings reveal this standard to be unmet. It concluded: \n“50%  of  the  minority-preferred  candidates  have  lost  City  Council  elections \nbetween 2008-2018 due to white bloc voting.” JA1232. A 50-50 split does not \nshow that white bloc voting “usually” defeats the minority-preferred candidate, \nas this Court opined in  Lewis, 99 F.3d at 616 (stating that “a court would \nineluctably find” failure on this element in “circumstances” where “minority-\npreferred candidates were successful fifty percent of the time”); see also Cottier v. \nCity of Martin, 604 F.3d 553, 560 (8th Cir. 2010) (en banc); Clay v. Bd. of Educ., \n90 F.3d 1357, 1362 (8th Cir. 1996). \nThe district court erred in concluding otherwise. First, it discounted races \nwhere white candidates were found to be minority preferred, JA1232,11 but this \nCourt rejected that precise argument in Lewis, 99 F.3d at 607 (“[T]he minority-\npreferred candidate may be either a minority or a non-minority….”). This error \nwas particularly pronounced, and prejudicial, because the court considered the \nsame races in finding cohesion, JA1222, thereby considering successful white \n \n11 Dr. Grofman’s report makes the same legal error. SJA233-34. \n47 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 58 of 65 Total Pages:(58 of 78)\n \ncandidates where it helped Plaintiffs’ case and ignoring them where it harmed \nthat case. See, e.g., John Allan Co. v. Craig Allen Co. LLC, 540 F.3d 1133, 1139 \n(10th Cir. 2008) (“[I]nternally inconsistent findings constitute clear error.”) \nSecond, the district court discounted the two 2018 races where Black \ncandidates  prevailed,  positing  that  these  reflected  “special  circumstances \nbecause” they occurred “after the instant lawsuit was filed.” JA1232. But there \nis no rule that post-filing elections are irrelevant. Rather, this Court has held that \na “court should probe further to determine whether” post-filing success “resulted \nfrom unusual circumstances.” Collins v. City of Norfolk, 816 F.2d 932, 938 (4th \nCir. 1987). In Collins, for instance, the Court opined that it might have been \nrelevant that the mayor, who had never before supported a Black candidate, \nsupported a Black candidate in a post-filing contest and stated publicly: “After \nthe election, the issue of black representation may become a moot point.” Id. \nEven then, the statement was “not dispositive”; rather a “proper inquiry must \nexamine the result of the mayor’s conduct and statement.” Id. \nHere, nothing connects the pendency of this lawsuit to the 2018 success of \nthe two Black candidates, and the district court identified no such connection. \nThere was, at that time, no coalitional claim, the case had been floundering in \nthe wrong court and was beleaguered by aimless motions practice, and there is \nno evidence that it attracted any meaningful amount of attention in the City. \nThe district court, however, concluded that “abnormally large support from \nwhite voters” for the 2018 Black candidates constituted a special circumstance. \nJA1232. But there is nothing suspicious about white voters supporting Black \n48 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 59 of 65 Total Pages:(59 of 78)\n \ncandidates. Absent a showing that the lawsuit caused this crossover voting, \nwhite  support  for  Black  candidates  cuts  against  Plaintiffs  on  the  third \nprecondition and cannot alone establish a special circumstance. \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Fails Under the Totality of the Circumstances \n“The ultimate determination of vote dilution under the Voting Rights \nAct…must be made on the basis of the ‘totality of the circumstances.’” Lewis, 99 \nF.3d at 604 (edit marks omitted). To make this assessment, courts consider \nvarious factors, including the so-called Senate factors and those the Supreme \nCourt has added. Cane v. Worcester Cnty., 35 F.3d 921, 925 (4th Cir. 1994). The \ndistrict court’s analysis at this stage was erroneous. \n1.  The  district  court’s  analysis  of  what  it  called  “the  deferential \nDeGrandy  fourth  factor,”  JA1236,  repeated  its  errors  on  the  third  Gingles \npreconditions. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997 (1994), held that the existence \nof  majority-minority  districts  roughly  proportional  to  the  minority  group’s \noverall  percentage  in  a  jurisdiction  cuts  heavily  against  a  claim  for  more \nmajority-minority districts. Id. at 1009-24. In challenges to at-large systems, \ncourts have applied this rule by assessing whether minority-preferred candidates \nhave held seats in rough proportion to the minority group’s percentage of the \npopulation. See, e.g., Solomon v. Liberty Cnty. Comm’rs, 166 F.3d 1135, 1143 (11th \nCir. 1999); United States v. Euclid City Sch. Bd., 632 F. Supp. 2d 740, 753 (N.D. \nOhio 2009). Here, the district court’s findings established that proportionality, \nestablishing that two of ten seats are held by minority-preferred candidates and \nthat numerous minority-preferred candidates have, in the past, prevailed. The \n49 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 60 of 65 Total Pages:(60 of 78)\n \ndistrict court concluded otherwise only because it had already discounted those \nresults in evaluating the third Gingles precondition. JA1236-37. Because that \ndiscounting was erroneous, so too was the Court’s De Grandy analysis. \n2.  The district court erred in failing to analyze each of the totality \nfactors as to each of the coalitional constituencies. Just as proof of cohesion is \n“all  the  more  essential”  when  “dilution  of  the  power  of…an  agglomerated \npolitical bloc is the basis for an alleged violation,” Growe, 507 U.S. at 41, a \nunique totality inquiry, analyzing each constituency on each factor, is essential. \nBut here, the district court relied overwhelmingly on facts concerning the Black \ncommunity and attributed those facts to all “Minority” residents of the City. \nThis injected “impermissible racial stereotypes” into the analysis, Shaw, 509 \nU.S. at 647, as the district court, in effect, assumed any disadvantage suffered by \nany racial minority group amounted to disadvantage suffered by anyone who is \nnot  white.  Only  “a  searching  practical  evaluation  of  the  ‘past  and  present \nreality,’” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 75, concerning each disparate group could yield the \nconclusion that a coalition suffers a shared disadvantage.  \nThe correct analysis would have changed the outcome. The district court \nconcluded that Plaintiffs “provided sufficient evidence to show that each factor \nis  met,”  JA1238,  but  only  because  it  found  facts  concerning  the  Black \ncommunity under each rubric. It did not find facts as to the Asian community \nunder each factor, nor could it have. For example, in considering “consequences \nof official past and ongoing discrimination,” the court identified many ways in \nwhich  Asians  are  roughly  at  or  above  the  socioeconomic  status  of  whites, \n50 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 61 of 65 Total Pages:(61 of 78)\n \nincluding that “Asian students perform at the same, or higher, rate compared to \nwhite students,” that Asian high-school graduation rates are comparable to \nwhite rates, JA1249, that more Asian  students graduate college than white \nstudents,  JA1250,  that  Asian  household  income  exceeds  white  household \nincome, JA1251, and that white and Asian home-ownership rates are almost \nidentical. JA1252. In considering minority-candidate success, another senate \nfactor, the court identified one Asian-American elected to the City Council and \ndid not identify a single Asian-American who lost any Virginia Beach race. \nJA1262. In considering responsiveness of elected officials, the court found that \n“the City had overutilized Asian-American owned business.” JA1268 (emphasis \nadded). And, even on the question of past discrimination, the Court cited no \nevidence of discrimination against Asians of any stripe, only “racial segregation \nof whites and Blacks.” JA1238-43.  \nThe Court need not conduct its own totality-of-the-circumstances analysis \nto see that, had the district court applied the correct legal standard, it could not \npossibly have found that each factor is met. JA1238. Few, if any, were. This \nerror of law infected the analysis, which cannot stand under the correct inquiry. \nIII.  The  District  Court’s  Obey-the-Law  Injunction  Is  Improper  and \nUnenforceable \n  The district court erred in issuing vague injunctions that the City “comply \nwith Section 2 of the Voting Rights [A]ct” and abstain from “any practice, \npolicy,  procedure  or  other  action  that  results  in  the  dilution  of  minority \nparticipation in the electoral process.” JA1277. An injunction must “describe in \n51 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 62 of 65 Total Pages:(62 of 78)\n \nreasonable  detail…the  act  or  acts  restrained  or  required.”  Fed.  R.  Civ. \nP. 65(d)(1)(C).  This  is  because  “[t]he  judicial  contempt  power  is  a  potent \nweapon. When it is founded upon a decree too vague to be understood, it can \nbe a deadly one.” Int’l Longshoremen’s Ass’n, Loc. 1291 v. Phila. Marine Trade Ass’n, \n389 U.S. 64, 76 (1967). Courts therefore have “held repeatedly that ‘obey the \nlaw’ injunctions are unenforceable.” Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. State of \nFla. Dep’t of Health & Rehab. Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1222 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation \nomitted); see also Burton v. City of Belle Glade, 178 F.3d 1175, 1200 (11th Cir. 1999) \n(rejecting injunction which prohibited municipality from discriminating on the \nbasis of race in its annexation decisions). \nAnd the problem here is not merely that the district court’s injunction \nduplicates the City’s obligations under Section 2, but also that Section 2 is a \nnotoriously convoluted statute, applicable to all the City’s election mechanisms \n(including those  imposed  on  it by the General Assembly), and requires no \nshowing of discriminatory intent. The City has minimal advanced means of \nknowing when the injunction is violated, and when contempt might be triggered. \nSee EEOC v. AutoZone, Inc., 707 F.3d 824, 841-42 (7th Cir. 2013); SEC v. Goble, \n682 F.3d 934, 950 (11th Cir. 2012). Worse, the injunction is not limited to “the \nviolation established in the litigation or similar conduct reasonably related to the \nviolation.” AutoZone, 707 F.3d at 841. If the City re-precincts, or enforces a state-\nimposed voter-identification law later found to violate Section 2, it could be \nsubject to staggering contempt penalties. The injunction is unlawful and must \nbe vacated. \n52 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-1            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 63 of 65 Total Pages:(63 of 78)\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe  injunction  should  be  vacated,  and  the  case  remanded  with \ninstructions  that  this  case  be  dismissed  or,  alternatively,  that  judgment  be \nentered for Defendants. \nREQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT \n  The City requests oral argument. \n \nDated: January 14, 2022  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n/s/ Katherine L.

Such minority citizens \nare from environments in which the dominant language is other than English. \nIn addition they have been denied equal educational opportunities by State and \nlocal governments, resulting in severe disabilities and continuing illiteracy in the \nEnglish language. The Congress further finds that, where State and local officials \nconduct elections only in English, language minority citizens are excluded from \nparticipating  in  the  electoral  process.  In  many  areas  of  the  country,  this \nexclusion is aggravated by acts of physical, economic, and political intimidation. \nThe Congress declares that, in order to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth \nand fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, it is necessary to \neliminate  such  discrimination  by  prohibiting  English-only elections,  and by \nprescribing other remedial devices. \n(2) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice,\nor procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to \ndeny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote because he \nis a member of a language minority group. \n(3) In addition to the meaning given the term under subsection (c), the\nterm “test or device” shall also mean any practice or requirement by which any \nState or political subdivision provided any registration or voting notices, forms, \ninstructions,  assistance,  or  other  materials  or  information  relating  to  the \nelectoral process, including ballots, only in the English language, where the \nDirector of the Census determines that more than five per centum of the citizens \nof voting age residing in such State or political subdivision are members of a \nsingle  language  minority.  With  respect  to  subsection  (b),  the  term  “test  or \ndevice”, as defined in this subsection, shall be employed only in making the \ndeterminations under the third sentence of that subsection. \nALA2 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-2            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 5 of 13 Total Pages:(70 of 78)\n(4) Whenever any State or political subdivision subject to the prohibitions\nof the second sentence of subsection (a) provides any registration or voting \nnotices,  forms,  instructions,  assistance,  or  other  materials  or  information \nrelating to the electoral process, including ballots, it shall provide them in the \nlanguage of the applicable language minority group as well as in the English \nlanguage: Provided, That where the language of the applicable minority group is \noral or unwritten or in the case of Alaskan Natives and American Indians, if the \npredominate language is historically unwritten, the State or political subdivision \nis only required to furnish oral instructions, assistance, or other information \nrelating to registration and voting. \n( Pub.

Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is amended by adding the \nfollowing new subsection: \n“(f)(1) The Congress finds that voting discrimination against citizens of language \nminorities is pervasive and national in scope. Such minority citizens are from \nenvironments in which the dominant language is other than English. In addition \nthey  have  been  denied  equal  educational  opportunities  by  State  and  local \ngovernments,  resulting  in  severe  disabilities  and  continuing  illiteracy  in  the \nEnglish language. The Congress further finds that, where State and local officials \nconduct elections only in English, language minority citizens are excluded from \nparticipating  in  the  electoral  process.  In  many  areas  of  the  country,  this \nexclusion is aggravated by acts of physical, economic, and political intimidation. \nThe Congress declares that, in order to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth \nand fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, it is necessary to \neliminate  such  discrimination  by  prohibiting  English-only elections,  and by \nprescribing other remedial devices. \n“(2) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or \nprocedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to \ndeny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote because he \nis a member of a language minority group. \n“(3) In addition to the meaning given the term under section 4(c), the term 'test \nor device' shall also mean any practice or requirement by which any State or \npolitical  subdivision  provided  any  registration  or  voting  notices,  forms, \ninstructions,  assistance,  or  other  materials  or  information  relating  to  the \nelectoral process, including ballots, only in the English language, where the \nDirector of the Census determines that more than five per centum of the citizens \nof voting age residing in such State or political subdivision are members of a \nsingle language minority. With respect to section 4(b), the term ‘test or device’, \nas  defined  in  this  subsection,  shall  be  employed  only  in  making  the \ndeterminations under the third sentence of that subsection. \n“(4) Whenever any State or political subdivision subject to the prohibitions of \nthe second sentence of section 4(a) provides any registration or voting notices, \nforms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the \nALA6 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 53-2            Filed: 01/14/2022      Pg: 9 of 13 Total Pages:(74 of 78)\nelectoral process, including ballots, it shall provide them in the language of the \napplicable language \nminority group as well as in the English language: Provided, That where the \nlanguage of the applicable minority group is oral or unwritten, the State or \npolitical subdivision is only required to furnish oral instructions, assistance, or \nother information relating to registration and voting.”. \n*** \nSEC. 207.

Does the City’s obligation to obtain preclearance of the remedial plan under \nthe Virginia Voting Rights Act moot its appeal? \n \n2.  Does a member of a minority coalition have standing to bring a Section 2 \nclaim? \n \n3.

Did the district court correctly conclude that Virginia Beach violated Section \n2  after  finding  extensive  qualitative  and  quantitative  evidence  that  the \nminority coalition’s votes are being diluted? \n \n5.  Upon finding that an election system violates Section 2, is an injunction \nrequiring Defendants to enact a non-dilutive map improper? \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nVirginia’s most populous city has long used an at-large election system that \ndilutes the voting strength of its large and growing population of Black, Hispanic, \nand Asian-American voters. To be elected at-large, city council candidates must \ncampaign across all 249 squares miles of Virginia Beach and compete for the votes \nof all of the City’s approximately 450,000 eligible voters. Even when minority-\npreferred candidates muster the resources to launch such an onerous campaign, they \nmost often lose because the City’s white majority votes together to block these \ncandidates. Virginia Beach’s long-silenced minority voters have sought to reform \nthis dilutive scheme for decades. But much like the results of the electoral system \nitself, the city council has ignored the City’s cohesive minority community.  \nPlaintiffs brought this Voting Rights Act lawsuit seeking to vindicate their \n1 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 10 of 66\nright to have an equal opportunity to elect city councilmembers. After years of \nlitigation and remedial proceedings, Virginia Beach’s minority voters have prevailed \nand finally obtained the basic electoral equality they are due. This Court should not \ndisturb that achievement.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI.  Factual Background \n \nPlaintiffs established at trial that Virginia Beach’s electoral system dilutes the \nability of Black, Hispanic, and Asian-American voters (the “Minority Community”) \nto elect candidates of their choice to the City Council.    \nResponding to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that the City’s prior electoral \nsystem was unconstitutionally dilutive, in 1966 Virginia Beach adopted a new at-\nlarge  election  system  with  new  problems.  JA1155.  To  elect  the  City’s  eleven \ncouncilmembers in its nonpartisan elections, “[f]our [councilmembers] are elected \nat-large without regard to residence, and seven are elected at-large but must reside, \nrespectively,  one  in  each  of  seven  residency  districts”  that  are  considered \n“designated or numbered posts.” JA1151, 1155. Under this system, “all at-large \ncandidates [must] campaign across 249 squares miles” of Virginia Beach for the \nvotes  of  “450,000  eligible voters”  instead  of only  voters  in a  specific district. \nJA1156. \n  The at-large system enables the City’s white majority to vote together to block \n2 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 11 of 66\nthe growing Minority Community from electing its preferred candidates. Between \n1990 and 2020, Virginia Beach’s minority voting-age population increased from \napproximately 21% to 38.5%, SJA258, with “[e]ach of the constituent groups … \nincreas[ing] during that period while the white population fell.” JA1154. But the at-\nlarge  system  prevents  the  Minority  Community  from  translating  its  increasing \npopulation into representation. Since 1966, zero Hispanic candidates, “five Black \nCity  Council  candidates  (Aaron  Rouse,  Sabrina  Wooten,  Dr.  Amelia  Ross-\nHammond,  Louisa M.  Strayhorn,  and John  L.  Perry)  and  one  Asian-American \ncandidate (Ron A. Villanueva) have been elected to the City Council.” JA1151.1 The \nCity’s first minority candidate was not elected until 1986, see JA1166, 1704, and \nwhen the district court issued its liability determination, “no Black councilmember \nhad ever been reelected,” JA1155. \nThe district court found that minority-preferred candidates routinely lose to \nwhite-preferred candidates in the City’s at-large system. JA1155. From 2008-2018, \nthe City held seven elections and “only 16 out of 74 candidates were Black. Of the \n22 winners, only three were Black.” JA1155-56. Despite accounting for nearly 40% \nof the population, the “Minority Community elected a candidate of choice in only \n                                                 \n1  Defendants  claim  the  district  court  clearly  erred  in  finding  that  former \ncouncilmember Rita Belitto was not Latina. Br. at 7, n.3. However, evidence in the \nrecord shows that her ethnicity was not clear. JA1262. And even if it were, going \nfrom six minority victors to seven is immaterial. \n3 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 12 of 66\none of the seven (14%) elections” for city council during this period. JA1155. At the \nsame time, “94% of the white community’s preferred candidates were successful.” \nJA1218. The recent election of minority-preferred candidates Wooten and Rouse \noccurred in 2018 only after this litigation began, and the district court concluded \nthey won because of atypically high support from the City’s white voters and \ncampaign  contributors.  JA1168.  The  district  court  additionally  concluded  that \nminority  candidates  fare  no  better  for  other  citywide  elected  offices.  JA1168. \n  Virginia Beach’s dilutive election system and the discrimination minority \nvoters face impedes their effective participation in the political process. The district \ncourt concluded that the “Commonwealth of Virginia and the City of Virginia Beach \nhave  long  established  histories  of  racial  discrimination  that  have  affected  the \nMinority Community.” JA1160. Significant disparities continue between the City’s \nwhite majority and each component of the Minority Community “with regard to per \ncapita income, the poverty rate for individuals, the percentage with SNAP assistance, \nmedian home values, … the percentage of 18-64 year-olds with no health insurance,” \nand  adverse  “educational  outcomes”  due  in  part  to  lasting  school  segregation. \nJA1161. One ongoing example is Burton Station, a historically Black neighborhood \nthat has long “lacked basic sewer and water infrastructure.” JA1173. Despite the \nMinority Community’s decades of advocacy, the City “only started to work on the \nsewer and water project for Burton Station in the past five years.” JA1173. The \n4 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 13 of 66\ndistrict court also found that Virginia Beach’s non-white immigrant populations \n“face adverse treatment unlike that of their white counterparts” such as “generalized \nhostility  towards  immigrants”  in  “housing  discrimination”  and  employment. \nJA1166.  City  officials  have  targeted  explicit  derogatory  comments  at  Asian-\nAmerican residents. JA1163. And the City was forced to agree in a federal consent \ndecree that its police hiring practices discriminated against minority candidates. \nJA1172.  \n  Inequality and discrimination likewise infect the electoral process. The district \ncourt found the Minority Community faces discriminatory conditions in “[voter] \nregistration, voter suppression, gerrymandering, and other forms of discrimination” \nin voting, such as disparate treatment in polling places. JA1160, 1165. Lasting \nnegative effects of these conditions have contributed to the Minority Community’s \ndisproportionately low voter registration rates and turnout. JA1162, 1165-66. \n  The Minority Community has not taken this mistreatment sitting down. The \nMinority Community has “cooperated numerous times to change the City’s method \nof elections and remedy the dilution of their votes under the at-large scheme.” \nJA1163. In 2001, a “coalition of African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Indians \n[] advocated for the City to adopt single-member districts.” JA1163. A cross-section \nof Minority Community leaders, including “Ron Villanueva, a Filipino-American \nand former Council member” and “Nonato Abrajano, a former leader of the City’s \n5 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 14 of 66\nFilipino-American community,” together formed the Virginia Beach Concerned \nCitizens Coalition and “urged the City Council to adopt single-member districts to \nhelp ensure equal representation.” JA1163. The City declined those reforms. In \n2011, the Minority Community again “propose[d] illustrative redistricting maps” of \nsingle-member  districts,  which  the  council  still  rejected  despite  one  current \ncouncilmember admitting “the current system is flawed” because it “dilutes the \nvoting strength of voters.” JA1164. \nIn addition to this collective advocacy against the at-large system, the district \ncourt  found  that  Black,  Hispanic,  and  Asian-American  residents  have  worked \ntogether to protest against City officials’ racism and the City’s maintenance of a \nconfederate  monument.  JA1163-65.  The  Minority  Community’s  “common \ninterests”  in  expanding  “housing  and  transportation”  options  galvanized  the \ncoalition,  including  supporting  expanded  “light  rail  while  white[]  [residents] \nopposed it.” JA1165. And the coalition urged the City for nearly a decade to create \na Minority Business Council that would account for “the shared history of economic \nand social discrimination in the Minority Community” and to conduct a disparity \nstudy, which the City agreed to do only after a Black resident offered to pay half the \ncosts.  JA1165,  1170-71.  The  study  “showed  a  substantial  disparity  in  the \n6 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 15 of 66\nparticipation of minority-owned businesses in [City] contracts.”2 JA1268.  \nII.  Procedural Background \n \nIn October 2020, the district court held a six-day bench trial. After conducting \n“a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality” and a “functional \nview of the political process,” the court issued a 133-page order on March 31, 2021, \nfinding that Defendant’s at-large method for electing City Councilmembers violates \nSection 2. JA1194-95 (applying Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986)).  \nThe  district  court  found  that  Plaintiffs  established  the  three  Gingles \npreconditions for Section 2 liability. Plaintiffs satisfied the first Gingles precondition \nby submitting ten illustrative maps showing the Minority Community is “sufficiently \nlarge  and  geographically  compact  to  constitute  a  majority  in  a  single-member \ndistrict.” JA1195. Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans established the ability to draw at least \ntwo  majority-minority  districts  for  the  Minority  Community  that  adhered  to \ntraditional redistricting criteria. See JA1196-98, 1308-32. Plaintiffs established the \nsecond and third Gingles preconditions because “there is strong evidence showing \nthat the Minority Community is politically cohesive, based on quantitative voting \n                                                 \n2 Defendants assert that the disparity study showed that “the ‘City had overutilized \nAsian-American owned business’ in public contracting” and claim that “members \nof the Asian communities generally enjoy a socio-economic status comparable with, \nif not better than, that of whites.” Br. at 7. But, as the district court concluded, “of \nthe dollars the Asian community received, 86% … went to a single Asian business.” \nJA1269.  \n7 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 16 of 66\npatterns  and  qualitative  evidence,”  but  their  preferred  candidates  usually  lose \nbecause of “substantial evidence of white bloc voting in Virginia Beach Council \nelections.” JA1236.  \n  The district court credited Plaintiffs’ experts’ analyses and testimony from \nDrs. Spencer and Lichtman showing that racially polarized voting drives city council \nelections. JA1210-26. Between 2008-2018, minority candidates won only three of \nfourteen elections, and the district court found special circumstances marked two of \nthese victories. JA1232. Comparatively, the evidence showed that “94% of the white \ncommunity’s preferred candidates were successful” between 2008-2018. JA1232.  \nBy contrast, the district court concluded that Defendants’ expert Dr. Kidd was \nunqualified  “as  an  expert in quantitative  statistical  methods or  racial  polarized \nvoting”  and  generally  that  his  “analysis  does  not  match  the  record.”  JA1228. \nBolstering Plaintiffs’ quantitative analysis, the district court also found “substantial \nqualitative evidence showing that Hispanic, Black, and Asian communities are \npolitically cohesive with respect to their shared political advocacy.” JA1211.  \n  The  district  court  likewise  concluded  that  the  totality  of  circumstances \nsupported  a  finding  of  Section  2  liability.  JA1238-77.  In  particular,  the  court \nevaluated the nine factors that guide the totality analysis, enumerated in Gingles, 478 \nU.S. at 37-37, and concluded that “Plaintiffs provided sufficient evidence to show \nthat each factor” suggested discrimination impeded the Minority Community from \n8 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 17 of 66\nelecting preferred candidates. JA1238. \nAt the remedial stage, Plaintiffs submitted proposed remedial maps with ten \nsingle-member districts that Defendants conceded satisfy  Gingles I “within the \nparameters  of  the  Court’s  liability  ruling,  assumed  to  be  legally  and  factually \ncorrect.” SJA155. The district court appointed Dr. Bernard Grofman—a renowned \nexpert whom both parties nominated—as special master to craft the remedial map. \nDr. Grofman’s plan, supported by 84 pages of analysis, creates three majority-\nminority districts where the Minority Community has an equal opportunity to elect \ntheir preferred candidates. SJA222-88, 342-58.   \nDr. Grofman performed “independent reanalyses” of information relevant for \n“assessing minority opportunity to elect,” including demographic patterns in the \nCity, “the extent of racial bloc voting in the City[], levels of minority and non-\nminority political cohesion in elections, and the frequency of minority electoral \nloss.” SJA225. Starting with the City’s demographics, Dr. Grofman found that the \n“minority population in the City of Virginia Beach is geographically concentrated \non the western edge of the city.” SJA226. Per the most recent census data, he noted \nthat Hispanic, Black, and Asian-American residents are 40.5% of the City’s total \npopulation, and 33% of the City’s citizen voting age population (“CVAP”). SJA228. \nDr.  Grofman  concluded  that  “ten-district  maps  for  the  City  Council  …  can \n‘naturally’  create  reasonably  compact  contiguous  districts  with  high  minority \n9 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 18 of 66\npopulation even with no attention to race simply because of the pattern of geographic \nconcentration of minorities in the City” and that because “the minority population in \nVirginia Beach is sufficiently concentrated … drawing three 50%+ minority CVAP \ndistricts … can readily be done.” SJA228.  \nDr. Grofman next analyzed the extent of racially polarized voting in Virginia \nBeach, focusing on twelve elections from 2010-2018 that he reported in Table 2 of \nhis initial report. SJA236, 229-45.  Dr. Grofman found that “[o]f the eight elections \nshown in Table 2 where there is a minority candidate of choice, voting is polarized \nalong racial lines in seven.” SJA237. From his independent analysis that “parallels \nthat in Judge Jackson’s Opinion,” Dr. Grofman concluded there was “essentially \nindisputable evidence of political cohesive patterns of voting for both White voters \nand for minority voters” SJA239-41; accord SJA239 (concluding “the minority \ncommunity in Virginia Beach” is “unquestionably politically cohesive in support of \nminority  candidates,  while  the  White  community  in  Virginia  Beach  is \nunquestionably politically cohesive in its opposition” (emphasis added)).  \nTo support his conclusions, Dr. Grofman analyzed voter rankings of minority \ncandidates, and the vote share received by candidates preferred by the Minority \nCommunity. Id. He found that minority voters rank minority candidates of choice \nmuch higher (1.0 rank) than do white voters (2.9 rank), and that “the average vote \nshare of the minority candidate among minority voters is 65.5%. By contrast, the \n10 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 19 of 66\naverage vote share of [those same candidates] among non-minority voters is only \n24.9%.” Id. Dr. Grofman determined that this pattern of minority cohesion was the \ncase whether the focus is “on contests where the minority candidate of choice is a \nminority  candidate”  or  “where  a  white  candidate  is  the  candidate  of  choice.” \nSJA241.  He  likewise  noted  that  the  district  court  qualitatively  supported  its \nconclusions  by  “devot[ing]  twenty  pages  …  to  the  extensive  evidence  of \nsociologically  and  politically  rooted  commonality  among  Black,  Hispanic,  and \nAsian populations in Virginia Beach.” SJA239. \nDr.  Grofman  then  reaffirmed  that  despite  the  Minority  Community’s \ncohesion, white bloc voting usually defeats their preferred candidates. Analyzing the \ntwelve City Council elections in Table 2 of his report, Dr. Grofman found that \n“minority candidates of choice regularly lose” in City Council elections absent \nspecial circumstances. SJA242. Because “there is a pattern of minority loss in five \nof eight elections [62.5%] with a minority candidate, and an expected pattern of \nminority loss in additional two future single seat elections” Dr. Grofman found “a \npattern of actual or expected future minority loss in seven of eight [87.5%] of the \nelections in Table 2 where there is a minority candidate of choice.” Id. However, Dr. \nGrofman clarified the “seven of eight” calculation actually “understates the degree \nto which the present electoral system has foreclosed minority opportunity to succeed \nin the electoral arena,” for two reasons: (1) likely “two of the[] three instances of \n11 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 20 of 66\nminority success [are because] the minority candidate who won that election would \nhave lost had there been fewer white candidates splitting the white vote,” SJA244, \nand (2) minority candidates “are deterred from running for at-large elections in the \ncity by their low chance of electoral success.” SJA242. \nThe district court adopted Dr. Grofman’s proposed remedial plan and entered \na final order finding that Dr. Grofman’s analysis further supports the court’s Section \n2 liability findings. SJA359-64. \nIII.  Changes to Virginia Law \n \nVirginia  recently  enacted  two  laws  affecting  Virginia  Beach’s  electoral \nsystem: (1) HB2198 and (2) the Virginia Voting Rights Act (“VVRA”). HB2198 \nprecludes  at-large  elections  for  residence  districts,  requiring  seven  of  Virginia \nBeach’s ten city council seats to be elected from single-member districts. Va. Code \n§ 15.2-1400(F). The VVRA is similar to, but broader than, Section 2 of the federal \nVRA. Unlike the federal VRA, for example, minority voters need not show they \ncould constitute a geographically compact majority of eligible voters in a single \nmember district. Id. § 24.2-130(B). The City’s attorney recognized as much in City \nCouncil meetings while this case was pending, noting: “[t]his likely means the \nplaintiffs in a state action will need not to rely on a coalition of minorities to satisfy \nthe State’s Voting Rights Act requirements,” and the VVRA “takes away a number \nof the defenses” Defendants assert here. Doc. 25-2 at 40:1-14; 14:3-15:3.   \n12 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 21 of 66\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n \nAfter  a  six-day  bench  trial  with  numerous  expert  reports,  a  dozen  fact \nwitnesses, and voluminous documentary evidence, the district court correctly ruled \nthat the City’s at-large system unlawfully dilutes Plaintiffs’ voting strength. Months \nof additional remedial proceedings—conducted by the appointed special master \nwhom both parties nominated—reinforced that Plaintiffs proved their case. The \ndistrict court and special master properly concluded that Virginia Beach’s Minority \nCommunity is sufficiently large and compact to form majority-minority districts; is \npolitically cohesive based on substantial quantitative and qualitative evidence that \nthe coalition backs the same candidates and causes; and is stifled by the City’s \nmajority block of white voters who routinely oppose minority-preferred candidates. \nUnder  the  totality  of  circumstances  of  Virginia  Beach’s  inequality  and \ndiscrimination, the district court ruled that Plaintiffs established the City’s electoral \nsystem violated Section 2.  \nDefendants fail to justify a different conclusion. Defendants’ jurisdictional \narguments  that  this  case  is  currently  moot  and  that  Plaintiffs  lack  standing  to \nvindicate their own rights are without merit. Instead, Defendants ignore that their \nobligation to seek preclearance of the court-imposed remedial plan under the broader \nVirginia Voting Rights Act will moot their appeal. Their contention that the Voting \nRights Act prohibits discrimination only against particular racial groups is contrary \n13 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 22 of 66\nto the plain text of Section 2 and the majority of cases interpreting it. Defendants’ \nvarious attacks on the district court’s detailed discussion of Section 2’s elements \nmisapprehends precedent, and disregards the clear error review standard by urging \nthe Court to accept Defendants’ (and their disqualified expert’s) distorted view of \nthe record. And Defendants’ last-ditch argument that the district court improperly \nenjoined the City’s dilutive election system and required a non-dilutive replacement \nis unavailing.  \nFollowing  decades  of  dismissed  collective  advocacy,  Virginia  Beach’s \nminority voters have won an equal opportunity at achieving representation on the \nCity’s governing council. The Court should affirm the district court’s decision. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe Court “review[s] judgments resulting from a bench trial under a mixed \nstandard of review: factual findings may be reversed only if clearly erroneous, while \nconclusions of law are examined de novo.” Raleigh Wake Citizens Ass’n v. Wake \nCty. Bd. of Elections, 827 F.3d 333, 340 (4th Cir. 2016) (citation and quotations \nomitted). “If the district court’s view of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire \nrecord, an appellate court may not reverse even if it is convinced that it would have \nweighed the evidence differently in the first instance.” Brnovich v. Democratic Nat’l \nComm., 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2349 (2021) (citation omitted).  \nThe Fourth Circuit applies deferential clear error review in vote dilution \n14 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 23 of 66\nmatters.  Because  “[c]laims  of  vote  dilution  require  trial  courts  to  immerse \nthemselves in the facts of each case, and to engage in ‘an intensely local appraisal \nof the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms,’” the appellate \ncourt’s “function is not to reweigh the evidence presented to the district court.” \nUnited States v. Charleston Cty., S.C., 365 F.3d 341, 349 (4th Cir. 2004) (quoting \nGingles, 478  U.S.  at  79).  In  “fact-intensive  areas”  where  knowledge  of  local \nconditions is key, the Court “defer[s] to resident district courts, who have both \nknowledge of the local community and fact-finding expertise.” See United States v. \n269 Acres, More or Less, Located in Beaufort Cty., S.C., 995 F.3d 152, 166 (4th Cir. \n2021). To “preserve[] the benefit of the trial court’s particular familiarity with the \nindigenous political reality,”  the  Court  simply  determines  whether  “the district \ncourt's finding rested on substantial, credible evidence.” Charleston Cty, 365 F.3d at \n349. Moreover, in redistricting matters, the Court’s “role in reviewing the district \ncourt’s reliance on” or rejection of “expert testimony is limited.” Levy v. Lexington \nCty., S.C., 589 F.3d 708, 719 (4th Cir. 2009). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  HB2198  did  not  moot  this  case  but  the  City’s  obligation  to  obtain \npreclearance under the VVRA will moot this appeal.  \n \nHB2198 did not moot the case but the City’s obligation to obtain preclearance \nunder the VVRA will likely moot this appeal. A case becomes moot “when the issues \npresented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the \n15 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 24 of 66\noutcome,” which occurs “only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual \nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.” Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) \n(citations omitted). When a defendant claims its violative conduct ended “partway \nthrough litigation,” it has  “the heavy burden of persuading the court that it is \nabsolutely  clear  that  the  allegedly  wrongful  behavior  could  not  reasonably  be \nexpected to recur.” 6th Cong. Dist. Republican Comm. v. Alcorn, 913 F.3d 393, 407 \n(4th Cir. 2019) (citations, quotations, and alteration omitted). A change in law that \nleaves in place the defendants’ “authority and capacity to repeat [the] alleged harm” \ndoes not moot the case. Porter v. Clarke, 852 F.3d 358, 364 (4th Cir. 2017) (citations \nand quotations omitted). A case is thus moot only if the defendant’s changed conduct \n“afford[s] complete relief” for the injury. United States v. City of Cambridge, Md., \n799 F.2d 137, 140 (4th Cir. 1986).  \nA.  HB2198 did not moot this case. \nHB2198 did not moot this case. Plaintiffs seek “the implementation of an \nelection system for the City Council that complies with Section 2” and “that all \nfuture elections for the City of Virginia Beach comply with Section 2[.]” JA0061. \nAlthough HB2198 converted seven of Virginia Beach’s ten City Council districts \nfrom  at-large  to  single-member  districts,  it  left  Plaintiffs’  Section  2  injury \nunremedied in two key ways: (1) it did not address how the seven districts should be \nconfigured  or  require  them  to  be  drawn  to  provide  minority  voters  an  equal \n16 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 25 of 66\nopportunity to elect their preferred candidates, and (2) it left in place three dilutive \nat-large seats. Va. Code § 15.2-1400(F).  \nBecause  HB2198  does  not  require  the  seven  “residency  districts”  to  be \nreconfigured to comply with Section 2 and does not eliminate the remaining three \nat-large seats, Defendants’ conformance fails to “afford complete relief.” City of \nCambridge,  799  F.2d  at  140.  Defendants  do  not  contend  they  configured  the \npreexisting “residency districts” to afford an equal opportunity for the Minority \nCommunity to elect its preferred candidates, nor could they. And they do not contend \nthey  eliminated  the  three  at-large  seats.  Defendants’  remaining  “authority  and \ncapacity to repeat [the] alleged harm” to Plaintiffs’ equal opportunity to elect their \npreferred candidates means HB2198 does not moot the case. See Porter, 852 F.3d at \n364. Plaintiffs’ injury is certainly “capable of repetition” and could “persist in future \nelections” at the City’s discretion under HB2198. See, e.g., Action NC v. Strach, 216 \nF. Supp. 3d 597, 612 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (applying Arcia v. Fla. Sec’y of State, 772 \nF.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2014)). \nB.  This appeal will become moot upon the administrative approval of \nthe remedial plan under the VVRA. \n Defendants’ use of the remedial map to comply with its separate VVRA \nobligations will moot their appeal once the plan is administratively approved. The \nVVRA, enacted after the district court entered its injunction, governs all Virginia \nredistricting and is more protective than Section 2. Unlike Section 2, it does not \n17 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 26 of 66\nrequire showing that the diluted minority voters are “geographically compact or \nconcentrated in a locality,” and thus does not require proof of a cohesive group of \nminority voters that exceed 50% in any number of districts. Va. Code § 24.2-130(B). \nThe City attorney acknowledged this fact. Doc. 25-2 at 40:1-14.  \nTo comply with the VVRA, the City must either (a) promulgate and publicly \npost its map for public comment, and face the possibility of a state court challenge \nto the plan, or (b) submit the plan for preclearance with the Virginia Attorney \nGeneral. See Va. Code §§ 24.2-304.1, 24.2-129. Although the City has not yet \nundertaken its VVRA administrative review obligations, it must do so. The district \ncourt’s  remedial  plan  resolved  Plaintiffs’  federal  VRA  challenge  but  does  not \nautomatically satisfy the City’s independent VVRA obligations, which are more \nonerous than its Section 2 obligations. The City must still obtain administrative \napproval to ensure that state law does not require a districting plan more solicitous \nof minority voting rights. Nothing in the VVRA excuses the City’s dilatory non-\ncompliance with its state-law mandate merely because a federal court has ordered a \nremedy for a distinct federal law violation. See Va. Code § 24.2-129. \nThe City must advance the remedial plan to satisfy its independent state-law \nobligations, which would moot the City’s appeal over its federal law obligations. \nGiven the VVRA’s broader requirements, the City will not have the “authority and \ncapacity to repeat [the] alleged harm” if the plan is precleared. Porter, 852 F.3d at \n18 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 27 of 66\n364. As this Court recognized when Section 5 of the federal VRA still required \npreclearance, administrative approval of a plan moots a challenge to the prior regime \nif the plan also resolves the Section 2 allegations. See Fayetteville, Cumberland Cty. \nBlack Democratic Caucus v. Cumberland Cty., N.C., 927 F.2d 595, 1991 WL 23590, \nat *3 (4th Cir. 1991). \nThe City’s obligation to obtain preclearance under the VVRA counsels in \nfavor of deferring resolution of this appeal until after the preclearance process. \nDoing so would preserve judicial economy and ensure that the Court does not \nunnecessarily expend resources when there may no longer be a live controversy. \nII.  Plaintiffs have standing.  \n \nPlaintiffs have standing to assert their Section 2 coalition claim. Defendants \ndo not contest Plaintiffs’ constitutional standing but argue they lack prudential \nstanding to sue on behalf of the coalition because Plaintiffs are Black. Appellants’ \nAm.  Opening  Br.  (“Br.”)  at  19.  Defendants’  third-party  prudential  standing \nargument is in “tension with [the Court’s] recent reaffirmation that a federal court’s \nobligation to hear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually unflagging.” \nLexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 126 (2014) \n(citations omitted).  \nAssuming prudential standing’s viability, it is inapplicable here. Plaintiffs’ \nSection 2 claims do not implicate third-party standing because they vindicate their \n19 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 28 of 66\nown  injury  as  members of  a single protected  coalition  of minority  voters.  See \nJA0100-01, 1183; see also Kumar v. Frisco Indep. Sch. Dist., 476 F. Supp. 3d 439, \n460 (E.D. Tex. 2020) (detailing that third-party standing is impertinent to coalition \nclaims).  Defendants’  contrary  arguments  question  the  merits  of  the  Minority \nCommunity’s cohesiveness. “[T]he Court must be careful not to” accept Defendants’ \neffort to “put[] the merits cart before the standing horse” on this question. Cooksey \nv. Futrell, 721 F.3d 226, 239 (4th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). At the jurisdictional \nstage, the Court “must [instead] assume that on the merits the plaintiffs would be \nsuccessful in their  claims”  that  the  coalition is  cohesive  and  cognizable under \nSection 2 without being separated into its constituent parts. See id. (citation omitted). \nDefendants’ standing argument is thus misplaced and incorrect.  \nIII.  The district court correctly ruled that Virginia Beach’s electoral system \nviolates Section 2 of the VRA. \n \nThe district court correctly concluded that Virginia Beach’s electoral system \nviolates  Section  2.  Defendants  contend  that  minority  coalition  claims  are  not \ncognizable under Section 2, that the Virginia Beach Minority Community is not \ncohesive, that white voters do not usually defeat the preferred candidates of the \nMinority Community, and that the totality of circumstances do not justify a finding \nof vote dilution. The plain text of Section 2 and the weight of the authority foreclose \nDefendants’ first argument, and Defendants do not prove the district court clearly \nerred in its factual findings under the second and third Gingles preconditions, or the \n20 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 29 of 66\ntotality-of-circumstances. This Court should reject Defendants’ arguments. \nA.  Section 2 recognizes minority group coalitions. \nA coalition of two or more politically cohesive minority groups may seek \nrelief  under  Section  2.  Applying  Section  2  to  protect  minority  coalitions  is \n“necessary and appropriate to ensure full protection of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth \nAmendments rights,” because voting discrimination is just as problematic when it \nprejudices one minority group as when it harms several. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. \n952, 992 (1996) (O’Connor, J., concurring). Section 2’s plain text permits minority \ncoalition claims. So does the weight of persuasive authority in the Supreme Court \nand other circuits. Defendants’ and amicus’s contrary arguments are without merit.  \n1.  Section 2’s plain text permits coalitional claims \n \nSection 2’s plain text authorizes coalition claims. Section 2, like other civil \nrights statutes, is “written in starkly broad terms,” see Bostock v. Clayton Cty., \nGeorgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1753 (2020), and should be interpreted in “the broadest \npossible scope.” Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 403 (1991) (citation omitted).  It \nempowers “any citizen” to challenge any “qualification or prerequisite to voting or \nstandard, practice, or procedure” that discriminatorily “deni[es] or abridge[s]” the \nright to vote. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Section 2’s “broad language” does not limit its \nprotections to a single minority group bringing claims seriatim; it instead reflects \n“Congress’s presumed point to produce general coverage.” See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. \n21 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 30 of 66\nat 1749 (internal quotation omitted).  \nSection 2(a) of the VRA prohibits any voting standard or practice that “results \nin a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on \naccount of race or color,” or language-minority status. 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301(a), \n10303(f). Section 2(b) sets forth how a violation of Section 2(a) is established, and \nnotes  that  it  applies  to  “a  class  of  citizens  protected  by  subsection  (a).”  Id. \n§ 10301(b). The “class of citizens” to which Section 2(b) refers is not a singular \nminority group, but rather those “protected by subsection (a)”—i.e., “any citizen” \nsubject to a denial or abridgment of voting rights “on account of race or color, or” \nlanguage-minority status. Id. Nothing in the text of Section 2 requires every member \nof the “class of citizens” to share the same race, as opposed to the same experience \nof being politically excluded “on account of race,” whatever their race is. Id. Section \n2 protects all minority voters and reading it to protect only one at a time defeats its \nbroad textual mandate.  \nDefendants’ strained statutory interpretation isolates “class” in subsection (b) \nto mean only a single harmed  minority group. This reading improperly plucks \n“class” from its statutory context. See Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 \n(2015)  (the  “meaning  of  a  word  cannot  be  determined  in  isolation”)  (citation \nomitted)).  “Class”  instead  means  “[a]  group  of  people  …  that  have  common \ncharacteristics or attributes,” Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), and refers to \n22 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 31 of 66\nthe plural of “citizens” listed as protected groups in subsection (a): racial, ethnic, and \nlanguage-minority  citizens.  Accordingly,  “class  of  citizens”  means  the  class \nmembers  must  merely  share  the  common  characteristics  of  being  a  Section  2 \nprotected  racial,  ethnic,  or  language  minority  voter  experiencing  vote  dilution. \nReading “class of citizens” to include a combination of protected minority citizens \naccords with both the last antecedent grammatical rule, see Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 \nU.S. 20, 26 (2003), and the singular-plural canon of statutory interpretation, see \nUnited States v. Haas, 986 F.3d 467, 481 (4th Cir. 2021) (applying 1 U.S.C. § 1). \nDefendants also contend that in referring to members of the class who have \nless  opportunity  than  “other  members  of  the  electorate,”  Section  2  creates  a \n“comparative test” between “Black voters with Asian and Hispanic voters” as well \nas white voters. Br. at 25. Under Defendants’ newly invented interpretation, if a \nsystem dilutes Black and Hispanic voting power, then it dilutes neither because both \nare “equally” unable to elect their preferred candidates. This result is absurd. The \ncomparison  required  by  Section  2  is  not  among  harmed  minority  groups,  but \nbetween harmed minority voters protected by subsection (a) and unharmed “other \nmembers of the electorate”—in this case, Virginia Beach’s majority of white voters.  \n2.  The vast majority of courts have held that Section 2 protects \ncoalition districts.  \nConsistent with the statute’s plain text, the vast majority of courts to consider \nthe issue have held that Section 2 permits coalition claims. While the Supreme Court \n23 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 32 of 66\nhas not expressly resolved the issue, it has assumed that Section 2 allows coalition \nclaims. Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41 (1993); see also Bartlett v. Strickland, \n556 U.S. 1, 13-14 (2009) (plurality) (declining to address whether minority coalition \nclaims are cognizable). In Houston Lawyers’ Association v. Attorney General of \nTexas,  the  Court  entertained  a  Section  2  challenge  pursued  by  “a  statewide \norganization  composed  of  both  Mexican-American  and  African-American \nresidents.” 501 U.S. 419, 421 (1991). Similarly, in Wright v. Rockefeller, the Court \naccepted that a coalition of Black and Puerto Rican voters brought a constitutional \nvote dilution challenge but rejected the merits. See, 376 U.S. 52, 54 (1964). The \nSupreme Court also recognizes coalition claims in the vote denial context. Just last \nterm, the Court evaluated a coalition of Black, Hispanic, and Native American \nvoters’ Section 2 vote denial claims. See Brnovich, 141 S. Ct. at 2322.  \nCourts in the First, Second, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits expressly \nrecognize that Section 2 protects minority voter coalitions.3 The Fifth Circuit’s \n                                                 \n3 See, e.g., Huot v. City of Lowell, 280 F. Supp. 3d 228, 231 (D. Mass. 2017); \nNAACP, Spring Valley Branch v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 462 F. Supp. 3d 368, \n379-80 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (applying Bridgeport Coal’n for Fair Representation v. \nCity of Bridgeport, 26 F.3d 271 (2d Cir. 1994)); aff’d sub nom. Clerveaux v. E. \nRamapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 984 F.3d 213 (2d Cir. 2021); Campos v. City of Baytown, \nTex., 840 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1988); Badillo v. City of Stockton, Cal., 956 F.2d \n884 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that factual record did not demonstrate the coalition’s \ncohesion); Concerned Citizens of Hardee Cty. v. Hardee Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 906 \nF.2d 524, 526 (11th Cir. 1990) (same). \n24 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 33 of 66\ndecision in LULAC, Council No. 4386 v. Midland Independent School District, in \nwhich  a  Black  and  Hispanic  coalition  challenged  their  at-large  school  board, \nillustrates the need for Section 2 coalitions. 812 F.2d 1494 (5th Cir. 1987) (“LULAC \nI”).4  Both  groups  in  LULAC  I  suffered  voting  discrimination  and  resulting \nsocioeconomic  disparities,  but  even  when  they  jointly  tried  to  overcome  these \ninequities,  white-bloc  voting  in  the  at-large  system  consistently  defeated  their \npreferred candidates. Id. at 1496-99. Because the coalition experienced the same \ndiscriminatory vote dilution injury and had “common social, economic, and political \ninterests which converge [to] make them a cohesive political group,” they could \njointly pursue their claims to achieve single-member districts. Id. at 1501-03. The \ndistrict court rightly followed the overwhelming majority of persuasive authority to \nadopt coalition claims. JA1193. \nDefendants urge this Court to depart from the majority rule, and instead follow \nthe single outlier, the Sixth Circuit. See Nixon v. Kent County, 76 F.3d 1381 (6th Cir. \n1996) (en banc). But the Nixon majority misinterpreted Section 2’s text to reach its \nconclusion foreclosing coalition claims, detaching the word “class” from its context \nto mean a single racial group. Id. at 1386-87. This is contrary to the plain text, as \n                                                 \n4 Although the en banc court vacated the LULAC I panel decision on other grounds, \nsee 829 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1987) (en banc), the Fifth Circuit has since reinforced the \npanel’s ruling and adopted its reasoning to allow coalition claims. See, e.g., Brewer \nv. Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 1989); Campos, 840 F.2d at 1244. \n25 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 34 of 66\ndiscussed supra. The Sixth Circuit’s decision also depends on questionable “policy \nconcerns,” suggesting that even if there is proven discrimination against  minority \ngroups, “there is no basis for presuming such a finding regarding a group consisting \nof a mixture of both minorities.” Id. at 1391. But as the Nixon dissenters emphasize, \nthe more problematic “policy concern” is that rejecting coalition claims “requires \nthe adoption of some sort of racial purity test” that is inconsistent with Section 2’s \ngoal  to  eliminate  racial  divisions  in  voting.  Id.  at  1401 (Keith,  J.,  dissenting) \n(reasoning that if courts “are to make these [racial] distinctions, where will they end? \nMust a community that would be considered racially both Black and Hispanic be \nsegregated from other Blacks who are not Hispanic?”). As the majority of courts \nacknowledge, two or more minority groups shouldering the same discriminatory \ninjury should not preclude Section 2 relief.  \n3.  Section 2’s legislative history supports coalition claims.  \n \nSection 2’s legislative history clarifies that Congress designed the statute to \nprotect minority coalitions. This Court may “consult[] the understandings of the \nlaw’s drafters as some (not always conclusive) evidence.” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at \n1750. The Supreme Court often relies on Section 2’s legislative history. Brnovich, \n141 S. Ct. at 2332-33; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 43 & n.7. \nThe  1975  amendment  to  Section  2  added  language-minority  protections \nbecause Congress sought to address “pattern[s] of racial discrimination that ha[ve] \n26 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 35 of 66\nstunted … black and brown communities.”  S. Rep. No. 94-295, at 22-31 (1975). \nCongress  knew that  Texas,  for  example,  had a  substantial minority  population \n“comprised primarily of Mexican Americans and blacks” and “has a long history of \ndiscriminating against members of both minority groups.” Id. at 25. Congress sought \nto protect together all “racial or ethnic groups that had experienced appreciable prior \ndiscrimination in voting.” Salas v. Sw. Texas Junior Coll. Dist., 964 F.2d 1542, 1549 \n(5th Cir. 1992).  \nThe  1982  amendment’s  legislative  history  also  reinforced  that  minority \ngroups, together, must have “a fair chance to participate” and “equal access to the \nprocess of electing their representatives.” S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 36 (1982). Thus, if \nCongress meant to exclude coalitions, “Congress would have made it explicit in the \nstatute, or at least some of the Members would have identified or mentioned it at \nsome point in the unusually extensive legislative history of the 1982 amendment.” \nChisom, 501 U.S. at 396. \n4.  Defendants’  policy  and  constitutional  arguments  against \ncoalitions are without merit.  \n \nDefendants contend that applying Section 2 to protect coalitions, as its text \nand  purpose  requires,  would  lack  administrability  and  inject  excessive \nconsiderations of race. Not so. \nFirst, Defendants’ administrability objection is belied by three decades of \nevidence: with the exception of the Sixth Circuit, courts in all the other circuits to \n27 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 36 of 66\nconsider the question have long applied Section 2 to protect minority coalitions. See \nsupra n.3. Defendants’ reliance on Bartlett for this point, Br. at 28, is misplaced \nbecause there the Court was concerned with abandoning the majority requirement of \nGingles prong one, which it thought would leave jurisdictions uncertain of when \nSection 2 obligations might arise. 556 U.S. at 17. But no such administrability issue \narises here; Plaintiffs do not advocate jettisoning the majority-minority requirement, \nbut rather combining cohesive minority populations that together exceed a district’s \nmajority of eligible voters. Addition is not too steep an administrative hurdle. \nSecond, recognizing Section 2 coalition districts does not inject excessive \nconsideration of race into redistricting. Coalition claims create no “assumption” of \ncohesive minority groups, as Defendants contend. Br. at 29. Rather, coalitions must, \njust like any other Section 2 claimant, prove their cohesion through quantitative \nand/or qualitative evidence. Campos, 840 F.2d at 1245. A key issue in all Section 2 \nclaims is whether “the minority group as a whole” votes cohesively but are stifled \nbecause of white bloc voting. See id. Defendants’ misplaced constitutional and \nadministrability arguments would apply to single-race claims as much as to coalition \nclaims.  \nDefendants’ novel Equal Protection argument also asks the Court to stretch \nthat  doctrine  beyond  its  bounds.  In  redistricting,  the  Equal  Protection  Clause \nnarrowly  proscribes  circumstances  where  “race  was  the  predominant  factor \n28 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 37 of 66\nmotivating the [redistricting] decision,” Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1463-64 \n(2017), such that the map was devised “without regard for traditional districting \nprinciples and without sufficiently compelling justification,” Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. \n630, 642 (1993); Cane v. Worcester Cty., Md., 35 F.3d 921, 927 n.6 (5th Cir. 1994) \n(constitutional concerns arise when district lines are only explainable by racial \nsegregation). Defendants provide no authority for inflating this doctrine to support a \ncategorical rule against coalition claims under a statute designed to prevent vote \ndilution. And the district court made careful factual determinations establishing that \nrace did not predominate in any of the redistricting decisions here. JA1198-99.  \nIn fact, coalition claims reduce racial distinctions. Allowing coalitions to sue \nadvances Section 2’s goal to address the lasting effects of discrimination without \n“produc[ing] boundaries [that] amplify[] divisions between” voting groups. See \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1469. Having an “arbitrary limitation” requiring minority \ngroups to sue separately would discount that varying minority groups “face the same \nimpediment to vote for their preferred candidates.” JA1191-92. Coalition claims \nencourage  cross-racial  partnerships  that  will  relieve  any  administrability  and \ndivisiveness concerns.5 See also United States v. Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 F.2d \n                                                 \n5 Defendants additionally imply, based on an oblique citation to City of Boerne v. \nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, 519 (1997), that Congress lacks authority to protect the civil \nrights of minority coalitions. Br. at 26. Nothing in City of Boerne supports that \nimplication.  Rather,  the  Supreme  Court  in  various  contexts  has  applied \n29 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 38 of 66\n1546, 1567 (11th Cir. 1984) (Section 2 is “intended not to create race-conscious \npolitics, but to remedy it where it already exists. The surest indication of race-\nconscious politics is a pattern of racially polarized voting.”).  \nCoalition claims also do not “hijack[] Section 2 for partisan ends.” Br. at 27. \nThe opposite is true. Without Section 2’s coalition claim protections, a jurisdiction \ncould dilute its minority voters’ political strength if they identify with multiple \nminority groups instead of one. Defendants’ argument is particularly irrelevant here, \nas Defendants’ councilmanic elections are nonpartisan. And Defendants’ suggestion \nthat evincing the coalition’s “political cohesion” somehow makes this type of claim \nquestionable, Br. at 24, is nonsensical—again, all Section 2 claims must prove \nminority political cohesion under the second Gingles precondition. \nFinally, Defendants’ reliance on Bartlett is misplaced because that Court \nexplicitly did not address coalition districts. See 556 U.S. at 13-14. And its reasoning \ndoes not apply to minority coalitions. The Bartlett plurality was concerned that \nfactually  distinct  crossover  claims  by  minority  and  white voters  would pose a \n“serious tension” with Section 2’s racially polarized voting precondition. Id. at 15-\n16. That tension is not present for coalition claims, which require proof that a \n                                                 \nantidiscrimination protections simultaneously to multiple minority groups. See, e.g., \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, Fla., 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1301 (2017) (allowing \nFHA claim by city on behalf of both Black and Latino mortgagors); Brnovich, 141 \nS. Ct. at 2322. \n30 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 39 of 66\ncohesive minority coalition is stifled by oppositional white-bloc voting.  \nSimilarly, Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421 (4th Cir. 2004), does not proscribe \ncoalition  claims  because  it  also  concerned  only  an  alleged  crossover  district \nincluding “black and white voters,” not a minority coalition district. Id. at 430. Far \nfrom limiting Section 2 minority coalitions, the Hall court “noted that ‘[t]here are \ncommunities in which minority citizens are able to form coalitions with voters from \nother racial and ethnic groups’” and seek to enforce their rights. Id. at 431 n.13 \n(quoting Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 483 (2003))). The Court’s nuanced \ndiscussion of coalitions concluded that Section 2 does not “create an entitlement for \nminorities to form an alliance with [white crossover] voters in a district who do not \nshare the same statutory disability as the protected class.” Id. But the inverse of this \nobservation is that Section 2 does recognize a claim when minority voters can prove \nthey  “form  an  alliance  with  other  voters”  who  do  “share  the  same  statutory \ndisability” of discriminatory vote dilution. See id. Hall reinforces that a coalition \nmust be composed of cohesive, statutorily protected minority groups; it “does not \nstand for the proposition that minority groups cannot be combined.” See NAACP, \nSpring Valley Branch, 462 F. Supp. 3d at 380 n.11. \nThe  district  court  properly  concluded  that  minority  groups  may  advance \ncoalition claims under Section 2, and that Plaintiffs satisfied Gingles prong one by \nshowing  alternative  districting  schemes  in  which  minority  voters  would  form \n31 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 40 of 66\ngeographically compact majorities in single-member districts. Defendants do not \ncontest that, if coalition districts are permitted, Plaintiffs satisfy Gingles prong one.6 \nB.  The Minority Community satisfies the Gingles prong two political \ncohesion requirement. \nThe Minority Community established their political cohesion. Gingles prong \ntwo requires “[a] showing that a significant number of minority group members \nusually vote for the same candidates is one way of proving political cohesiveness \nnecessary  to  a  vote  dilution  claim.”  478  U.S.  at  56.  Whether  the  Gingles \npreconditions  are  satisfied,  like  the  “ultimate  finding  of  votes  dilution,”  is  “a \nquestion of fact subject to the clearly-erroneous standard of Rule 52(a).” Id. at 78; \nsee also LULAC v. Clements (“LULAC II”), 999 F.2d 831, 864 (5th Cir. 1993) \n(explaining that political cohesion is “a question of fact”).  \nAlthough the minority group must be politically cohesive, Section 2 does not \nrequire a showing that the minority group votes as “an absolute monolith” for the \nsame candidates. See Ruiz v. City of Santa Maria, 160 F.3d 543, 554 n.19 (9th Cir. \n1998). And no particular form of evidence is required to establish political cohesion, \nas the district court may rely upon quantitative and/or qualitative evidence. See \n                                                 \n6 Defendants merely contend the court erred in finding “that Black voters alone can \nconstitute a majority in even one single-member district.” Br. at 22. However, \nDefendants’ own expert stated this was possible. JA1212. It is not clear error for the \ndistrict court to find the same. \n \n32 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 41 of 66\nBrewer,  876  F.2d  at  453  (“[S]tatistical  evidence  is  not  the  sine  qua  non  to \nestablishing cohesion”). This is because “Gingles ... suggests flexibility in the face \nof sparse data.” Lewis v. Alamance Cty., N.C., 99 F.3d 600, 621 (4th Cir. 1996) \n(quoting Citizens for a Better Gretna v. City of Gretna, 834 F.2d 496, 502 (5th Cir. \n1987)). \nThe  district  court  correctly  concluded  that  the  preponderance  of  the \nquantitative  and  qualitative  evidence  proved  that  the  Minority  Community  is \npolitically cohesive. JA1210-31. Defendants have not shown that this conclusion \nwas clear error.  \n1.  Quantitative evidence established cohesion.  \n \nThe district court properly relied on quantitative expert testimony at trial and \nin the remedial phase to find that the Minority Community is politically cohesive, \ncrediting Plaintiffs’ experts Drs. Spencer and Lichtman, and discrediting the analysis \nof Defendants’ expert Dr. Kidd. JA1215-31, 1243-44. Specifically, “[b]ased upon \nDr. Spencer’s credible analysis, the Court [found] that Plaintiffs provided sufficient \nevidence  showing  consistent  minority  cohesive  voting  for  a  minority-preferred \ncandidate and that whites overwhelmingly vote for different candidates.” JA1217.  \nDr. Spencer measured political cohesion through three standard statistical \nmethods:  homogenous  precinct  analysis,  ecological  regression  (“ER”),  and \necological inference (“EI”). JA1216, 1230; See, e.g., Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 461 \n33 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 42 of 66\nF.3d 1011, 1020 (8th Cir. 2006) (collecting cases). Using the voting pattern data \nfrom Dr. Spencer’s analysis, the district court examined a host of prior elections and \nconcluded that the evidence proved minority cohesion in city council elections. \nJA1217-31. In particular, the district court found “strong evidence of minority voter \ncohesion in seven elections with nine minority candidates” from 2008 to 2018 as \nwell as in five additional elections featuring white candidates preferred by the \nminority community. JA1224.7  \nThe  court  also  examined  elections  for  offices  other  than  city  council—\n“exogenous” elections—to support its finding that the minority community votes \ncohesively. JA1225. In the 2008 presidential election, for example, “90% of voters \nfrom the Minority Community strongly preferred Barack Obama over John McCain, \nwhile about 65% of white voters strongly preferred McCain.” JA1225. The numbers \nwere  similar  in the 2012  election between  Obama  and Mitt  Romney.  JA1225. \nUltimately, the district court found fourteen examples of minority vote cohesion in \ncity council races since 2008 in addition to the examples from exogenous contests \nand concluded that “Plaintiffs have satisfied [their] burden and shown that the \nminority community is politically cohesive.” JA1225.  \n                                                 \n7 For example, in the 2008 at-large election, Ms. Allen (a Black woman) received \n70% of the Minority Community’s vote, but only 20% of the white vote. She lost to \nMs. Wilson, the white-preferred candidate who received only 8% of the Minority \nCommunity’s vote but 59% of the white vote. JA1218. \n34 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 43 of 66\nDr. Spencer did not rely on any single statistical method of estimating voting \nbehavior by race, but rather cautioned that all should be consulted and the limitations \nand patterns of each carefully weighed in drawing conclusions. JA386. In particular, \nhe explained that Virginia Beach’s Hispanic and Asian-American populations are \ntoo small to isolate reliable statistical estimates for each group’s voting preferences. \nJA1216. But Dr. Spencer compensated for this limitation in his ER and EI analyses \nby using the accepted method of “estimat[ing] the joint preferences of non-white \nvoters overall, as well as the individual preferences of Black voters and white \nvoters.” Id.; SJA285. Dr. Spencer found that Black voters exhibited similar voting \npreferences as the combined Minority Community, indicating cohesion among all \ngroups. JA397, 1231. For some election contests, the EI and ER analyses estimated \nminor  differences  between  the  level  of  support  of  Black  voters  and  combined \nminority  voters,  but  Dr.  Spencer  described  these  perceived  differences  are \nimmaterial. JA377, 1230-31. To explain, Dr. Spencer conducted a homogenous \nprecinct analysis, which looks at the voting patterns in precincts with a heavy \nconcentration of the relevant population. JA370-71, 1230-31, SJA230, 237-38. Dr. \nSpencer found that when comparing homogenous Black precincts to homogenous \ncombined minority precincts, the candidate preferences were nearly the same, and \nexhibited strong cohesion. JA386-88, 404, 407-10, 1231. Moreover, Dr. Spencer \ntestified that ER assumes a linear relationship between electoral results and the \n35 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 44 of 66\nconcentration of minorities in precincts, but in this case the plotted data shows \notherwise,  i.e.,  the  model  understates  minority  cohesion,  and  buttresses  the \nhomogenous precinct analysis that showed near equal cohesion levels. JA387-92, \n1230. The district court credited Dr. Spencer’s analysis and opinions and found that \nthe Minority Community was cohesive, JA1215, 1230-31. \nThe district court likewise found that Dr. Grofman’s further analysis, SJA237, \nreinforced “that the Minority Community is politically cohesive.” SJA362. Dr. \nGrofman concluded that based on “high levels of demonstrated socio-economic \ncohesion and very high levels of minority electoral cohesion,” SJA241, the Minority \nCommunity  is  “unquestionably  politically  cohesive  in  its  support  of  minority \ncandidates.” SJA238, 285. He too concluded that this was confirmed by homogenous \nprecinct analysis. SJA237-38 (noting that homogenous precinct comparison “of \nexactly th[e] sort” performed by Dr. Spencer “allows inferences about racially \npolarized voting patterns vis-à-vis the minority group as a whole”).    \nDefendants contend that Gingles prong two requires Plaintiffs to show that \n“each group in the coalition is internally cohesive and that each group is cohesive \nwith the others.” Br. at 31. Defendants are incorrect on both fronts. The “key” \nSection 2 inquiry for coalition claims is whether “the minority group as a whole” is \npolitically  cohesive.  Campos,  840  F.2d  at  1245.  Contrary  to  Defendants’ \nrepackaging, cohesion is “a question of fact,” and neither plaintiffs nor the district \n36 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 45 of 66\ncourt are limited to the single cramped statistical framework Defendants propose.  \nSee, e.g., LULAC II, 999 F.2d at 864. \nThe district court weighed the available evidence and concluded that Plaintiffs \nhad  overcome  the  limitations  of  statistical  science  by  conducting  additional \ncomparative analysis that illustrated the Minority Community’s cohesion, even if \nthat analysis did not yield specific percentage estimates for Hispanic and Asian \nvoters for particular election contests. This is on top of Plaintiffs’ robust qualitative \nevidence of cohesion, discussed infra Part III.B.2. The legal requirement is to show \ncohesion, and if “statistical evidence is not a sine qua non to establishing cohesion,” \nBrewer, 876 F.2d at 454, then it cannot be that the specific type of statistical evidence \nDefendants demand is the sine qua non of establishing cohesion. Cohesion is a \nfactual question, and it is not clear error for the district court to conclude from the \nevidentiary  record—including  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  evidence  and  its \ndeterminations  about  which  experts  to  credit—that  the  preponderance  of  the \nevidence  demonstrated  cohesive  voting  among  the  Minority  Community.  See \nCampos, 840 F.2d at 1247.  \nDefendants also seize upon a single out-of-context sentence, see, e.g., Br. at \n11, from Dr. Grofman’s report where he concluded (as had Dr. Spencer) that “it is \n“mathematically impossible to derive the voting patterns for each minority group \nseparately.” SJA362. But Dr. Grofman explained that combining Hispanic, Black, \n37 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 46 of 66\nand Asian-American voters to estimate the coalition’s preferences shows “clear and \ncompelling evidence for racially polarized voting in Virginia Beach … and for \npolitical cohesion on the part of both the minority group and White voters in support \nfor or opposition to minority candidates.” SJA285. Dr. Grofman concluded, as did \nthe district court (and as should this Court), that Defendants’ argument relies “on \nmisrepresent[ing] the legal authority to which they cite[.]” SJA362, n.5. \nCore to Defendants’ misrepresentation is Brewer v. Ham. While Defendants \nargue the Fifth Circuit prohibits combined minority coalition cohesion estimates, the \ncourt instead reaffirmed that “minority groups may be aggregated” for Section 2 \nclaims. 876 F.2d at 453. The Fifth Circuit cautioned “against reaching conclusions \nabout inter-minority cohesion absent a diligent inquiry into the political dynamics of \nthe  particular  community,”  but  it  did  not  prohibit  using  aggregated  statistical \nevidence to do so. See id. It simply rejected the coalition claim in that specific case \nbecause of evidentiary failures that are not present here.8 Plaintiffs’ experts, as well \nas Dr. Grofman, relied on thorough statistical analyses to measure cohesion among \nthe Minority Community, whereas the plaintiffs in Brewer “presented no statistical \nevidence to support their claim.” 876 F.2d at 453. The Brewer court recognized that \n                                                 \n8 Amicus cites Growe, 507 U.S. at 40, where a lack of cohesion was found, but in \nthat case the district court had relied upon a law review article to support its finding. \nId. Here, the district court conducted a searching inquiry of local political conditions \nin finding that the Minority Community is cohesive. JA1211-31.  \n38 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 47 of 66\nbecause “statistical evidence is not a sine qua non to establishing cohesion,” the \nplaintiffs could have put on “other [qualitative] evidence … sufficiently probative” \nof cohesion, but failed to do so. Id. at 453-54. As discussed infra, Plaintiffs presented \nexactly the types of qualitative evidence here that the Brewer court founding lacking.  \nDefendants—at  trial  and  now—depend  heavily  on  testimony  of  their \nunqualified and discredited expert, Dr. Quentin Kidd, to rebut Plaintiffs’ quantitative \nevidence.  The  district  court  properly  found  Dr.  Kidd’s  analysis  unreliable  and \nrejected it because he failed to conduct any statistical analysis and “admitted that he \nhas never conducted an analysis of racially polarized voting in any jurisdiction.” \nJA1228-29. Defendants do not contend otherwise; nowhere in their brief do they \nappeal  the  district  court’s  conclusion  that  Dr.  Kidd  was  “not  [an  expert]  in \nquantitative statistical methods nor an expert in racially polarized voting” or the \ndistrict court’s finding that “Dr. Kidd’s analysis, methodology, and findings are \nneither  credible  nor  sufficient  to  rebut  Dr.  Spencer’s  findings.”  JA1228-29. \nDefendants have thus waived that argument. See Grayson O Company v. Agadir Int’l \nLLC, 856 F.3d 307, 316 (2017).   \nInstead  of  conducting  proven  statistical  analyses,  Dr.  Kidd  invented  an \nalgebraic theory purporting to show a lack of cohesion in the coalition—the same \nrejected theory Defendants deploy here and no court has before accepted. JA1228; \nBr. at 34-36. The district court and Dr. Grofman correctly discredited Dr. Kidd’s \n39 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 48 of 66\nnewly created theory and unsupported conclusion. JA1229-30; SJA285. As Dr. \nGrofman stated, Defendants’ attempted algebraic “method of triangulation is not \npossible when we are trying to separately estimate the behavior of four groups, rather \nthan just two groups.” SJA284-85, n.41. This is because of a basic problem “pointed \nout by teachers in algebra classes, of having more unknowns than you have equations \nfrom which to estimate the values of these unknowns.” Id. Because he lacked the \nnecessary  expertise,  Dr.  Kidd’s  shot-in-the-dark  approach  to  measure  voting \nbehavior resulted in a nonsensical oversimplification. Rather than accepting Dr. \nKidd’s flawed methodology, the district court credited the explanation offered by \nDr. Spencer, based on his credible, statistically acceptable analyses. JA1230-31.9  \nDr. Kidd’s inexperience also led to several other flawed quantitative analyses \nthat  Defendants parrot  in this  Court  but  the district  court  rightly  rejected.  For \nexample, Defendants attempt to salvage Dr. Kidd’s erroneous conclusion that a \n                                                 \n9 Defendants dwell on Dr. Spencer’s testimony showing the non-linear curves best \nexplained the small differences between Black and all minority support for certain \ncandidates in the ecological regression model. Br. at 39. They contend that this does \nnot explain those small differences in the ecological inference model, which they \nposit is not premised on linearity assumptions. Br. at 39-41. Defendants miss the \nforest for the trees. Dr. Spencer’s analysis showed that the ecological regression \nmodel’s conclusions—in light of the actual distribution of data—converged with the \nhomogenous precinct analysis to show near identical cohesive support between \nBlack voters and all minorities combined. JA404, 407-10, 1231. Holistically, all the \nquantitative methods pointed in one direction—a finding of cohesion—which the \ndistrict court credited. JA1230-31. Defendants ask this Court to simply reweigh the \nevidence and draw different conclusions; that is not this Court’s province.  \n40 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 49 of 66\ncandidate is only considered minority-preferred if they received 50%+1 votes. That \nview is both legally and factually unsound. Virginia Beach’s councilmanic elections \noften involve multiple candidates for the same seat in which the winner receives less \nthan 50%, see JA1230, JA1246, and minority-preferred candidates are not required \nto “achieve a threshold of 50% in a multi-candidate election,” see Lewis, 99 F.3d at \n613  n.10.  Dr.  Kidd’s  analysis  compounded  these  errors  by  relying  on  flawed \nestimates of minority voter turnout. But courts have repeatedly held that cohesion \nshould not be discounted because of low voter turnout. See, e.g., United States v. \nBlaine Cty., Mont., 363 F.3d 897, 910 (9th Cir. 2004). And even if such data were \npertinent, Dr. Kidd’s analysis was methodologically unhelpful in determining levels \nof turnout because he used “statewide, not Virginia Beach-specific, turnout data and \nhe does not provide any statistical analysis to support [his] claim” of turnout rates. \nJA1242. \nUndeterred by these shortcomings, Defendants ask this Court to accept Dr. \nKidd’s  flawed  theories  and  therefore  reject  Dr.  Spencer’s  reliable  statistical \nestimates of intra-coalition cohesion. Br. at 34-36. This invitation to second-guess \nthe district court’s conclusions and instead take the word of an unqualified witness \nimproperly asks this Court to abandon its “limited” “role in reviewing the district \ncourt’s  reliance  on …  expert  testimony,”  Levy,  589  F.3d  at  719,  which  offers \n“singular deference to a trial court’s judgments about the credibility of witnesses,” \n41 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 50 of 66\nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1474. Defendants have not shown clear error. \nDefendants finally contend that the district court “rewrote the standard of \ncohesion” to require Defendants to “disprove” cohesion. Br. at 37. Not so. The \ndistrict court first analyzed Dr. Spencer’s testimony and then turned to Dr. Kidd’s \ntestimony, which was “neither credible nor sufficient to rebut” Dr. Spencer, and thus \nDefendants presented no evidence that “disprove[s]” Plaintiffs’ credible cohesion \nevidence. JA1229. The court did not morph the “standard of cohesion.” It weighed \nthe evidence before it and found Dr. Spencer’s well-supported expert testimony on \none side and an opinion of an unqualified expert who declined to “open[] the data \nfile” to “run an independent analysis … because he ‘didn’t feel like it was needed’” \non the other. JA1228. The district court correctly found that Plaintiffs met their \nburden with robust quantitative analyses and Defendants simply failed to show that \nthe analysis was wrong.  \n2.  Qualitative evidence established cohesion. \n \nOn top of Plaintiffs’ quantitative evidence, the court found that qualitative \nevidence  also  demonstrates  that  Minority  Community’s  political  cohesion.  To \naccount for “the lack of available data” in certain Section 2 cases, see Cane, 35 F.3d \nat 925-26, qualitative evidence is “clearly relevant” in determining “whether the \nminority group is politically cohesive.” Sanchez v. Bond, 875 F.2d 1488, 1494 (10th \nCir. 1989); see also De Grandy v. Wetherell, 815 F. Supp. 1550, 1579 (N.D. Fla. \n42 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 51 of 66\n1992) (finding cohesive voting between Black and Latino voters in part through \nanecdotal testimony), aff’d in relevant part Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997 \n(1994). Such qualitative evidence shows a minority coalition has “common social, \neconomic, and political interests which converge to make them a cohesive political \ngroup.” LULAC I, 812 F.2d at 1501; accord Concerned Citizens, 906 F.2d at 526 \n(coalition must behave in a “politically cohesive manner”). Indeed, even without any \nstatistical evidence, qualitative evidence can demonstrate cohesiveness. See Arbor \nHill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass’n. v. Cty. Of Albany, No. 03-CV-502, \n2003 WL 21524820, at *8-10 (N.D.N.Y. July 7, 2003); Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 \nF.2d at 1567 nn.34 & 35 (explaining that “direct statistical analysis of the vote \nreturns” is not required to show cohesion). \n After reviewing the evidence and determining the credibility of witnesses, the \ndistrict court found the Minority Community is cohesive because they “have a \nhistory  of  advocating  for  similar  political  and  legal  issues,  and  have  similar \nexperiences of discrimination.” JA1210. The coalition has long advocated together \nin at least seven categories, seeking: (1) abandonment of the City’s dilutive at-large \nsystem; (2) racial justice in 2003 and the removal of Confederate monuments in \n2019; (3) creation of a Minority Business Council; (4) a disparity study; (5) housing \nreform; (6) improving public transportation; and (7) a range of reforms through the \nVirginia Beach Concerned Citizens Coalition, which includes Filipino-American \n43 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 52 of 66\nleaders and organizations. JA1211-15. Most of this evidence went unrebutted at trial, \nand this persistent collective advocacy further establishes the coalition’s political \ncohesion and buttresses the statistical findings.  \nDefendants object that the district court credited this qualitative evidence in \nsupport of cohesion, contending that it “has no logical relation to vote dilution.” Br. \nat  46.  Defendants’  conclusion  is  without  merit.  While  quantitative  evidence \ndemonstrating “that a significant number of minority group members usually vote \nfor the same candidates is one way of proving political cohesiveness,” Gingles, 478 \nU.S. at 31 (emphasis added), it is not the only way. See Luna v. Cty. of Kern, 291 F. \nSupp. 3d 1088, 1125 (E.D. Cal. 2018) (collecting cases using qualitative evidence); \nMarengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 F.2d at 1567 nn.34 & 35. Because “statistical evidence \nis not a sine qua non to establishing cohesion,” Brewer, 876 F.2d at 454, Plaintiffs \npresented  ample  nonstatistical  “evidence  [to]  also  establish  this  phenomenon,” \nMonroe v. City of Woodville, Miss., 881 F.2d 1327, 1331 (5th Cir. 1989). That \nqualitative evidence is valuable because “[t]he experiences and observations of \nindividuals involved in the political process are clearly relevant to the question of \nwhether the minority group is politically cohesive.” Sanchez, 875 F.2d at 1494. To \nhold  otherwise  would  be to  render  the VRA’s  protection  against vote  dilution \nbounded by the limits of statistical inference. Nothing in the text of the VRA compels \nthat result, and courts must avoid applying Gingles prong two “mechanically” and \n44 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 53 of 66\n“without regard to the nature of the claim.” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 158 \n(1993). \nDefendants’ backup factual challenge to Plaintiffs’ qualitative evidence asks \nthis Court to draw different conclusions from the record than did the district court. \nDefendants isolate testimony from their witness labeling Filipino-American voters \nas conservative, and conclude that this somehow undercuts Plaintiffs’ voluminous \nevidence of the coalition’s collective action including Filipino-American residents. \nBr. at 44-45. The district court did not credit Defendants’ cherrypicked testimony \nbecause the record belies it. JA1211-14, 1275-77. To begin, the point is irrelevant \nbecause City Council elections are nonpartisan. Additionally, the evidence showed \nthat Filipino-American leaders and organizations have long advocated for reforms \nalongside the coalition through the Virginia Beach Concerned Citizens Coalition, \nincluding a change to the City’s election system, among others. JA1211-14, 1243, \n1255,  1266-1273,  1275-77.  Defendants’  additional  argument  that  “all  other \nexamples” of qualitative cohesion were by Black residents only, Br. at 45, ignores \nthe record of Hispanic, Black, and Asian-American residents advocating together on \nthe seven categories discussed above. JA327, 1211-15, 1160-73. \nWhile Defendants ask this Court to reweigh the evidence and reach a different \nconclusion, that is not this Court’s role. Clear error review “extends not only to the \ndistrict court’s ultimate conclusion of vote dilution, but also to [any] ‘finding[s] that \n45 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 54 of 66\ndifferent pieces of evidence carry different probative values in the overall Section 2 \ninvestigation.’” Wright v. Sumter Cty. Bd. of Elections and Registration, 979 F.3d \n1282, 1301 (2020) (quoting Solomon v. Liberty Cty. Comm’rs, 221 F.3d 1218, 1227 \n(11th Cir. 2000) (en banc)). This Court should respect the trial court’s “particular \nfamiliarity with the indigenous political reality” if the Court’s factual finding of \ncohesion is plausible. Charleston Cty., 365 F.3d at 349. Here, the evidence far \nexceeds that threshold.  \nC.  The district court did not clearly err in finding Gingles prong three \nsatisfied. \n  The district court did not clearly err in finding that Plaintiffs established \nGingles prong three. The third Gingles precondition asks whether the jurisdiction’s \nwhite majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc to enable it … usually to defeat the \nminority’s preferred candidate.” 478 U.S. at 50-51. The “white bloc voting must \n‘normally’  or  ‘generally’  lead  to  the  defeat  of  minority-preferred  candidates.” \nCharleston Cty., 365 F.3d at 348. To make this determination, the court “identif[ies] \nthose  individuals  who  constitute  minority-preferred  candidates”  and  then \n“analyze[s] whether those candidates are usually defeated by majority White bloc \nvoting;” Levy, 589 F.3d at 716, while considering whether “the success of a minority \ncandidate can be attributed to special circumstances” and given less probative value. \nCollins v. City of Norfolk, Va., 883 F.2d 1232, 1241 (4th Cir. 1989). \nThe district court found that minority-preferred candidates usually “lost City \n46 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 55 of 66\nCouncil elections between 2008-2018 due to white bloc voting,” “while 94% of the \nwhite community’s preferred candidates were successful” during the same stretch. \nJA1232. The court emphasized that under the City’s racially polarized conditions, \nand special circumstances for certain races, minority-preferred candidates won at \nmost five out of twelve probative elections, or just 42%. JA1233.  \nAdditional findings supported the district court’s conclusion that even this low \nsuccess figure understates the City’s severe dilutive conditions for four reasons. \nFirst, white residents overwhelmingly support white candidates: “in 11 of the 12 \ncontests in which there were minority candidates, the white community ranked a \nwhite candidate first,” and even given the atypical uptick in white crossover voting \nin 2018 “the average level of white support for minority candidates is around 25%.” \nSJA240. Second, minority-preferred candidates win almost exclusively in the rare \ninstances  when  they  receive  white support or  where  multiple  white  candidates \nsufficiently split white-bloc voting. SJA244, JA1232-34. Third, the evidence shows \nthat Virginia Beach’s white-bloc voting is at its apex in elections featuring non-white \ncandidates preferred by the Minority Community, JA1232, 1235-36, SJA239, 242, \nand the district court properly gave these instances greater probative weight. See \nSolomon, 221 F.3d at 1227 (courts may assign “more probative value to elections \nthat include minority candidates, than elections with only white candidates”); Ruiz, \n160 F.3d at 552-53 (same). Fourth, because of the severity of white bloc voting, \n47 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 56 of 66\npotential  minority-preferred  candidates  are  deterred  from  even  investing  the \nresources needed to launch an at-large campaign in Virginia’s largest city. SJA244, \nJA1245-47.  \nFinally, the district court correctly concluded that the more recent successes \nof minority-preferred candidates overcoming white-bloc voting are the result of \nspecial circumstances. The third Gingles precondition requires showing that the “the \nwhite majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it—in the absence of special \ncircumstances . . .— usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” 478 U.S. \nat 51 (emphasis added). Election successes during the pendency of litigation are \nconsidered special circumstances because they could “work[] a one-time advantage \nfor  [minority-preferred]  candidates  in  the  form  of  unusual  organized  political \nsupport by white leaders concerned to forestall single-member districting.” Id. at 75-\n76. Or it could be that “minority successes [after the lawsuit was filed] … are \nsufficiently recent and, potentially, transitory to limit their probative value.” Jenkins \nv. Red Clay Consol. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 4 F.3d 1103, 1132 (3rd Cir. 1993).  \nEither  way,  elections  during  the  pendency  of  litigation  are  less  probative  for \nevaluating white bloc voting. Collins, 883 F.2d at 1242. \nBecause minority-preferred candidates in Virginia Beach started receiving \nenough white support to overcome polarized voting only after this lawsuit was filed, \nthose elections are less probative of the third Gingles precondition. JA1232-33, \n48 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 57 of 66\n1248, 1262-65.10 Of the three Black minority-preferred councilmanic candidates \nelected in the last decade, the district court found that “two of the three,” Rouse and \nWooten, “won their elections under special circumstances because their elections \nwere after the instant lawsuit was filed and they had abnormally large support from \nwhite voters … as compared to” other minority-preferred candidates. JA1232-33, \n1248,  1265.11  Dr.  Grofman  also  found  that  the  third  winning  Black  minority-\npreferred candidate was elected due to special circumstances. SJA242.  \nDefendants’ vaguely assert that the district court failed to “probe further” the \nRouse and Wooten elections and failed to “connect[] the pendency of this lawsuit to \n                                                 \n10 Gingles only discusses special circumstances in the context of the white-bloc \nvoting analysis, so “court[s] may discount th[ose] election[s] as evidence weighing \nagainst the plaintiffs in analyzing the third prong of the Gingles test.” Michael S. \nTaintor, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, Special Circumstances, and Evidence of \nEquality, 94 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1767, 1771 (2019) (collecting cases). \n11 For example, both Councilmembers Rouse and Wooten received unusually high \nand unprecedented support from white voters at the ballot box. JA1263-65, 1233, \nSJA240.  They  both  also  received  atypical  campaign  contributions  from  white \ncandidates and donors. JA1248, 1265. Councilmember Rouse was also listed on a \nslate of candidates supported by a prominent Republican organization, Friends of \nthe Elephant, who “handed out sample ballots at one or more polling places with \nrecommended candidates for office. These sample ballots were color coded, with \none color for Black voters and another color for white voters.” JA1248. Rouse was \n“included on sample ballots handed to Black voters, but not on the ones handed to \nwhite voters.” Id. Additionally, his status as a well-known college and professional \nfootball player gave him immediate name recognition and an abnormal boost to his \ncampaign.  See  Gunn  v.  Chickasaw  Cty.,  Miss.,  1:92CV142-JAD,  1997  WL \n33426761, *4 (N.D. Miss. Oct. 28, 1997) (being a professional athlete is a special \ncircumstance). He was also endorsed by the governor of Virginia and U.S. Senator \nWarner, both very rare for a local city council election. JA2432-33.  \n49 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 58 of 66\nthe 2018 success of the two Black candidates.” Br. at 48. That is incorrect. The \ndistrict court, following the Fourth Circuit’s analysis in Collins, thoroughly reviewed \nthe Rouse and Wooten elections and found special circumstances. JA1232-33, 1248, \n1265. Even if Defendants were right that Rouse and Wooten’s mid-litigation election \nsuccesses are not “suspicious,” Br. at 46, that is irrelevant; special circumstances \nelections are those that have atypical results because they are mid-litigation even in \n“the absence of a conspiracy or an intent to moot this litigation.” See Collins v. City \nof Norfolk, Va., 816 F.2d 932, 938 (4th Cir. 1987). The district court appropriately \nfound  the  Rouse  and  Wooten  elections  were  less  representative  compared  to \nelections prior to the lawsuit and therefore less probative for understanding the \neffects of white bloc voting.    \nAs Gingles instructs, the district court accounted for all these circumstances \nbearing on racially polarized voting in Virginia Beach to conclude that Plaintiffs \nsatisfied the third precondition. Defendants have not shown this was clear error. \nD.   The totality of circumstances weighs decisively in Plaintiffs’ favor. \nThe district court correctly found that the totality of circumstances in Virginia \nBeach supported Section 2 liability. After plaintiffs establish the three Gingles \npreconditions, Section 2 requires a final conclusion that “based on the totality of \ncircumstances,” minority voters “have less opportunity than other members of the \nelectorate to participate in the political process[.]” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). This \n50 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 59 of 66\nanalysis  considers  nine  non-exhaustive  factors  to  evaluate  conditions  of \ndiscrimination and their relation to vote dilution in the jurisdiction. Charleston Cty., \n365 F.3d at 345. Where, as here, “a plaintiff established the Gingles prerequisites, \nthat plaintiff is likely to succeed under the totality of the circumstances.” Baten v. \nMcMaster, 967 F.3d 345, 379 (4th Cir. 2020).  \nThe district court conducted a “searching practical evaluation of the ‘past and \npresent reality’” of discrimination and inequality in Virginia Beach, see Gingles, 478 \nU.S.  at  75  (citation  omitted),  and  concluded  that  the  totality  of  circumstances \ndecisively favored Plaintiffs. See JA1159-74, 1237-77.  Defendants do not dispute \nthe extensive discriminatory conditions facing the Minority Community. Instead, \nthey assert that the court failed to analyze each factor for “each of the coalitional \nconstituencies” and claim that no Section 2 violation occurred because of their \nmiscalculation  that  the  Minority  Community  holds  a  proportional  share  of \ncouncilmanic seats. Br. at 49-51. Both arguments misapprehend Section 2 and the \nrecord.  \nFirst, the City cites no authority for its insistence that the district court must \nmechanically evaluate every Senate Factor for each component of the coalition. This \nis  for good  reason: the Supreme  Court expressly  rejects  Defendants’  approach \nbecause “there is no requirement that any particular number of [the Senate] factors \nbe proved, or that a majority of them point one way or the other.” Gingles, 478 U.S. \n51 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 60 of 66\nat 45 (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29); see also Charleston Cty., 365 F.3d at 353 & \nn.4 (affirming the totality of circumstances favored plaintiffs, without proof of all \nfactors); Collins, 883 F.2d at 1243 (same). This rule applies the same in Section 2 \ncoalition cases. See, e.g., NAACP, Spring Valley Branch, 462 F. Supp. 3d at 392 \n(evaluating coalition together under Senate Factors); Campos v. City of Baytown, \n696 F. Supp. 1128, 1136 (S.D. Tex. 1987) (same). Adopting Defendants’ stilted, \ncheck-the-boxes approach to the totality-of-circumstances analysis would transform \nit into “[a]n inflexible rule [that] would run counter to the textual command of § 2” \nand fail to account for “the demonstrated ingenuity of state and local governments \nin hobbling minority voting power.” De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1018.  \nDefendants are likewise factually incorrect that the district court failed to find \ndiscriminatory conditions affecting the entire coalition. The court emphasized that \n“[w]hile it is true that Asian, Hispanic, and Black communities have experienced \ndifferent  forms  of  discrimination,  they  have  nonetheless  experienced \ndiscrimination.”  JA1241.  Concerning  Senate  Factor  one,  the  court  detailed  the \nState’s and the City’s long history of discrimination against all minority residents, \nbut specifically described animus “target[ing] minority immigrant communities.” \nJA1240. The court found that the adverse “impact of discrimination is similar across \nall minority groups.” JA1242. On Senate Factors two, three, and four, the court \nfound racially polarized voting and discriminatory voting practices—such as the \n52 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 61 of 66\nCity’s “unusually large election districts and … single shot system” for voting and \nits  “informal  candidate-slating  processes”—affected  the  entire  Minority \nCommunity’s  voting  strength.  JA1243-47.  The  district  court  ruled  that  Black, \nLatino, and Asian-American residents face socio-economic disparities under factor \nfive, such as having lower high school graduation rates, lower per capita income, \nhigher poverty rates, lower voter registration rates, and worse healthcare conditions \nand educational outcomes compared to their white counterparts. JA1248-56. \nThe court uncovered racial appeals in political campaigns under factor six that \nprejudiced Black candidates as well as Delegate Kelly Fowler, Virginia Beach’s \nstate legislature representative who is a woman of Mexican and Filipino descent. \nJA1256-61.  Each  part  of  the  coalition  is  underrepresented  in  Virginia  Beach \nelections under factor seven: “since 1966,” when the City enacted its at-large system, \nit “has elected only five Black Councilmembers and one Asian-American” and zero \nHispanic candidates. JA1262. The court explained that the City is unresponsive to \nthe needs of the entire coalition under factor eight, manifested in Virginia Beach’s \ndiscriminatory  hiring  practices,  disparate  allocation  of  City  resources,  and \nlongstanding refusal to heed the community’s calls for a racial disparity study and \nestablishing the Minority Business Council. JA1266-75. Finally, the court concluded \nthat the City’s justifications for its dilutive electoral system under factor nine were \ntenuous,  particularly  given  the  entire  coalition’s  determined  but  unsuccessful \n53 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 62 of 66\ndemands  for reform. JA1275-77. Thus, even if Defendants’ checklist  approach \napplied, the district court satisfied it.   \nSecond, after Defendants agreed that three opportunity-to-elect seats for the \nMinority  Community  would  remedy  the  Section  2  violation,  see  SJA155, \nDefendants bizarrely argue now that two seats are proportional to the coalition’s \noverall population in Virginia Beach and that such supposed proportionality “cuts \nheavily” against liability. Br. at 49. Defendants have miscalculated the percentages. \nHaving  minority  councilmembers—whose  elections  were  marked  by  special \ncircumstances, see supra Part III.C—hold two-of-ten seats (20%) is simply not \nproportional to the minority coalition comprising 38.5% of the City’s voting-age \npopulation. SJA258. In any event, the scant electoral success for minority candidates \nin  Virginia  Beach—six  total  over  a  half  century—comes  nowhere  near  the \nproportionality conditions emphasized in Johnson v. De Grandy. JA1262. It instead \nconfirms the district court’s detailed conclusion that the City’s electoral system \nviolates Section 2 under the totality of circumstances.   \nIII.  The District Court Appropriately Enjoined and Remedied the City’s \nDilutive System.  \n \nThe  district  court’s  injunction  of  the  City’s  dilutive  electoral  system  is \nsquarely within its authority under Rule 65. Defendants rely on out-of-circuit cases \nto challenge the injunction as merely an “obey the law” order, Opening Br. at 52, \nwhile overlooking that this Court has repeatedly approved injunctions in analogous \n54 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 63 of 66\nSection 2 cases that are materially indistinguishable from the order issued below. \nSee, e.g., United States v. Charleston Cty., S.C., 316 F. Supp. 2d 268, 307 (D.S.C. \n2003), aff’d, 365 F.3d 341 (4th Cir. 2004); Collins, 883 F.2d at 1244. As the Court \nhas explained in other contexts, if the City “really intends to comply with the \n[statute], its future … conduct will in no way be inhibited by an injunction. It is to \nbe noted that an injunction in this type of case is not a burdensome thing; it simply \nrequires the [City] to obey the law.” Hodgson v. Approved Pers. Serv., Inc., 529 F.2d \n760, 764 (4th Cir. 1975) (citation and quotation omitted).  \nThe  district  court’s  injunction  and  order  devising  an  undiluted  map \nappropriately provide Plaintiffs an “effective remedy for the claimed injury” and is \nwell within its remedial authority. See Hines v. Mayor & Town Council of Ahoskie, \n998 F.2d 1266, 1273 (4th Cir. 1993).  \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should affirm the district court’s decision.    \n55 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 62            Filed: 02/07/2022      Pg: 64 of 66\n   \nDated: February 7, 2022  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \nJ.

Coalition claims cannot, on the one \nhand,  be  recognized  as  a  robust  application  of  Section  2  that  is \n“administrab[le],” Appellees’ Brief (Br.) 28, and grounded in different groups’ \n“same experience of being politically excluded,” Br. 22, and, on the other hand, \nbe devoid of any legal standards, involving only “a question of fact” concerning \n“the minority group as a whole,” Br. 36 (quotation marks omitted). If coalition \nclaims  are  to  have  any  integrity,  this  particular  claim  must  be  rejected. \nOtherwise, the theory should be discarded. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants’ Appeal Is Not Moot \nThere is no merit in Plaintiffs’ assertion that “the City’s obligation to \nobtain preclearance under the [Virginia Voting Rights Act] will likely moot this \nappeal.” Br. 15. To begin, there is no “dilatory non-compliance with…state-law \nmandate.” Br. 18. The City obtained preclearance in mid-January 2022. But \nPlaintiffs do not explain how that pertains to mootness. Their sole authority \nfound only that a challenge to a redistricting plan was mooted by the county’s \n“adopt[ion] by resolution [of] a new voting plan.” Fayetteville, Cumberland Cty. \nBlack Democratic Caucus v. Cumberland Cty., 927 F.2d 595, 1991 WL 23590, at *1, \n5 (4th Cir. 1991) (unreported).  \nBut Defendants did not legislate a new plan by ordinance. The district \ncourt  “ORDER[ED]  the  City  of  Virginia  Beach  to  implement  the  plan \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 9 of 35\n \nimmediately….” SPA363.1 The “typical appellate relief” vacating that order will \ndeprive the plan of legal force and afford “effectual relief.” Chafin v. Chafin, 568 \nU.S. 165, 172-73 (2013). Preclearance does not change that. It permits the City \nto use the plan ordered by the court rather than mandates it. Va. Code § 24.2-\n129(B) and (D). \nPreclearance, in fact, was a formality. The federal-court order left state \nauthorities no room to object. “A state statute that thwarts a federal court order \nenforcing  federal  rights  ‘cannot  survive  the  command  of  the  Supremacy \nClause.’” Brinn v. Tidewater Transp. Dist. Comm’n, 242 F.3d 227, 233-34 (4th Cir. \n2001) (quoting Washington v. Wash. State Com. Passenger Fishing Vessel Ass’n, 443 \nU.S. 658, 695 (1979)). Besides, if Plaintiffs were right, the remedy would be for \nthis Court “to vacate…the lower court’s judgment,” as the City requests. Norfolk \nS. Ry Co. v. City of Alexandria, 608 F.3d 150, 161 (4th Cir. 2010); Lewis v. Cont’l \nBank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 482 (1990). \nII.  The District Court Erred in Reaching the Merits \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Challenge Is Moot \nDefendants’ opening brief explained (at 16-19) that Plaintiffs’ challenge \nagainst an “election method[] in which all councilmembers are elected at-large \nin citywide elections,” JA0048, is moot because HB2198 forbids the City from \nusing that system. Plaintiffs talk past Defendants’ arguments.  \n \n1 Plaintiffs cite, but do not discuss, Va. Code § 24.2-304.1. It applies to an \n“ordinance” and is irrelevant. Id. § 24.2-304.1(A). \n2 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 10 of 35\n \nPlaintiffs first contend that HB2198 “left in place three dilutive at-large \nseats.” Br. 17. But a case becomes moot when the challenged law “has been \nsuperseded by a significantly amended statutory scheme.” Esposito v. S.C. Coastal \nCouncil, 939 F.2d 165, 171 (4th Cir. 1991); Appellants Brief (Opening Br.) 16-\n17. That rule governs where “the plaintiff may have some residual claim under \nthe new framework” and requires that challengers “amend their pleadings” to \naddress the new system. N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. City of New York, 140 \nS. Ct. 1525, 1526 (2020) (quoting Cont’l Bank, 494 U.S. at 482). Plaintiffs do not \nacknowledge this governing standard or identify evidence germane to it. Nor do \nthey explain why the three at-large seats, in a new system with seven single-\nmember  seats,  remain  dilutive.  They  have  never  contended  that  all  eleven \ncouncil seats must be equal-opportunity districts.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that HB2198 “did not address how the seven \ndistricts should be configured or require them to be drawn to provide minority \nvoters an equal opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.” Br. 16-17. But \nVirginia law does forbid the City from using a future plan “that impairs the ability \nof members of a protected class…to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to \ninfluence the outcome of an election.” Va. Code § 24.2-130(A). Plaintiffs admit \nthis “is similar to, but broader than, Section 2 of the federal VRA.” Br. 12. \nAnd Plaintiffs have the framework backwards. Because a court cannot \nenjoin a law before it is enacted, review must follow enactment, not the other \nway around. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc., the Supreme Court did \nnot deem itself entitled to command the New York legislature to enact gun laws \n3 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 11 of 35\n \nin compliance with the Second Amendment. 140 S. Ct. at 1526-27. Likewise, a \nruling on the merits here—opining either on how Defendants should construct \na  future  plan  or  on  the  legality  of  a  repealed  system—is  “advisory.”  Md. \nHighways Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Maryland, 933 F.2d 1246, 1249 (4th Cir. 1991).  \nThird, Plaintiffs cite precedents applying the voluntary-cessation doctrine. \nBr.  17.  But  they  ignore  authority  Defendants  cited  holding  this  doctrine \ninapplicable where the cessation “was not voluntary.” Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC, 636 \nF.3d  641,  648  (D.C.  Cir.  2011).  Plaintiffs’  cited  authorities  involve  “a \ngovernmental entity’s change of policy,” where “it could return to the contested \npolicy in the future.” Porter v. Clarke, 852 F.3d 358, 364-65 (4th Cir. 2017). But \nstate law prohibits Defendants from returning to the challenged at-large system. \nOpening Br. 17. Nor do Defendants retain discretion to utilize “the preexisting \n‘residency districts,’” Br. 17, which are malapportioned. \nB.  Plaintiffs Lack Third-Party Standing To Claim Discrimination \nAgainst Asian and Hispanic Residents \nAs Defendants’ opening brief detailed (at 19-21), two Black plaintiffs lack \nstanding to assert that Asians and Hispanics are suffering vote dilution and \nobtain a remedy sorting Asians and Hispanics into districts on the basis of race.2 \nPlaintiffs do not deny that these voters are the best proponents of their own \nrights. \n \n2 Plaintiffs call “prudential standing” doctrines into doubt, Br. 19, but the case \nthey cite stated the bar on third-party standing may be compelled under Article \nIII. See Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 n.3 \n(2014). \n4 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 12 of 35\n \nInstead, Plaintiffs charge Defendants with conflating standing and the \nmerits. Br. 20. This is inaccurate. Without a coalition of plaintiffs, there is no \n“logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim,” even assuming its \nmerit. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 102 (1968). The claim remains a coalition \nclaim,  where  members  of  different  groups,  e.g.,  “Blacks  and  Mexican-\nAmericans[,]…join  hands…to  prevent  their  votes  being  diluted.”  LULAC, \nCouncil No. 4386 v. Midland Indep. Sch. Dist., 812 F.2d 1494, 1495 (5th Cir.), \nvacated, 829 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1987). A coalition claim requires a coalition of \nplaintiffs. The court-appointed special master took it as a given that a coalition \n“brought this lawsuit.” SJA235. \nIt is not enough for Plaintiffs to belong to a “single protected coalition,” \nBr.  20,  because  a  coalition  claim  “combine[s]  distinct  ethnic  and  language \nminority groups.” Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41 (1993) (emphasis added); see \nalso Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 13-14 (2009) (plurality opinion) (similar \ndefinition).  Plaintiffs  themselves  argue  that  “[t]he  ‘class  of  citizens’”  in  a \ncoalition claim “is not a singular minority group.” Br. 22. Thus, the claim on its \nown terms does not treat Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics as sharing one race. \nMembers of each group must therefore assert their own rights. See Nordgren v. \nHafter, 789 F.2d 334, 338 (5th Cir. 1986). \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Fails on the Merits \nA.  Section 2 Does Not Recognize Coalition Claims \nSection  2  “does  not  mention  minority  coalitions,  either  expressly  or \nconceptually.” Nixon v. Kent Cty., 76 F.3d 1381, 1386 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc). \n5 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 13 of 35\n \nPlaintiffs’ contrary arguments fail to distinguish coalition claims, brought by \nmultiple groups that otherwise lack a Section 2 injury, from parallel claims, \nwhere each group experiences independent injury and may bring the claim \nseparately or jointly. Plaintiffs’ attempts to justify the latter do not justify the \nformer. \n1.  Section 2 does not empower just any “class” to sue. A class must \nshare “a denial or abridgement of the right…to vote on account of race or color.” \n52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Plaintiffs implicitly acknowledge this limitation, Br. 22, \nand presumably agree that, e.g., Republicans and Democrats are not protected \nclasses. See 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a) and (b); but see JA1194 (district court implying \nthat “any group seeking to elect a particular candidate” qualifies). But persons \nwithout  a  shared  race  or  color,  whose  sole  commonality  is  candidate \npreferences, are the functional equivalent of a political party. Nixon, 76 F.3d at \n1392. \nPlaintiffs  purport  to  locate  coalitional  protection  in  racial  minorities’ \n“same experience of being politically excluded ‘on account of race,’ whatever \ntheir race is.” Br. 22. But racial minorities in a coalition case do not have that \n“same experience” because Section 2 deems none of them “politically excluded.” \nUnder Section 2, “[t]alk of ‘debasement’ or ‘dilution’ is circular talk,” Hall v. \nVirginia, 385 F.3d 421, 428 (4th Cir. 2004), unless a group “has 50 percent or \nmore of the voting population and could constitute a compact voting majority,” \nBartlett, 556 U.S. at 19. In a coalition claim, no constituency qualifies. Here, the \nBlack community does not independently qualify, the Asian community does \n6 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 14 of 35\n \nnot independently qualify, and the Hispanic community does not independently \nqualify.3 \nPlaintiffs do not explain how members of distinct groups share an injury \non account of race or color where they share neither an injury (since none is \nindependently injured) nor a race or color. The “impetus” for multiple groups \n“seeking to proceed as a coalition” is “their inability, as separate groups, to \novercome the first Gingles threshold factor.” LULAC, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, \n986 F.2d 728, 786 n.43 (5th Cir. 1993) (“LULAC”). But the statute does not view \nthem as a conglomerate; it defines them distinctly. Opening Br. 25-26. Plaintiffs, \ntoo, recognize them as “plural” not “singular.” Br. 22-23. To assume shared \nexperience merely from individuals not being “white voters,” Br. 23, reads \n“impermissible racial stereotypes” into Section 2. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, \n647 (1993). \nNor does proof of political cohesion bridge this gap. See Br. 25. For one \nthing, Plaintiffs deny that each group must be proven cohesive, independently \nor with others, so their version of coalition claims does not even purport to show \nanything shared by majorities of each group. Br. 36. For another, such proof \nwould show only that “candidates [who] do not obtain a majority of votes lose.” \nNixon, 76 F.3d at 1392. “That is not an unfortunate by-product of democracy, \n \n3 Plaintiffs’ tepid defense of the district court’s baffling conclusion that the Black \ncommunity does qualify is equally baffling. They cite JA1212 as showing that \n“Defendants’ own expert stated [a majority-Black district] was possible,” Br. 32 \nn.6, but the page says nothing like that. \n7 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 15 of 35\n \nbut is rather the purpose of democracy.” Id. A group sharing neither race nor \ncolor nor shared discrimination cannot be deemed excluded “on account of race \nor color” merely because of shared candidate preferences. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ rejoinders cannot overcome these basic problems. \nFirst,  it  is  not  true  that  Defendants’  argument  “isolates  ‘class’  in \nsubsection (b).” Br. 22. The statute references “a class of citizens protected by \nsubsection (a),” linking back to subsection (a)’s operative phrase “on account of \nrace or color.” A group sharing only alleged candidate preferences does not fall \nwithin that text, read in context. \nSecond, it is incorrect that Defendants’ argument creates the “absurd” \nresult that, “if a system dilutes Black and Hispanic voting power, then it dilutes \nneither….” Br. 23. To the contrary, if both Black and Hispanic voting power is \ndiluted, members of either group—or both—can sue to obtain majority-Black \nand  majority-Hispanic  districts.  A  coalition  claim  addresses  the  opposite \nscenario and proposes, oddly, that, if a system dilutes neither Black nor Hispanic \nvoting power, both groups’ votes can yet be deemed diluted. \nThird, Plaintiffs are correct that Section 2 “does not limit its protections \nto a single minority group bringing claims seriatim.” Br. 21. Nothing in Section \n2 prevents joinder of claims that might otherwise be brought separately. The \nquestion here, however, is whether Section 2 authorizes joint claims that could \nnot be brought separately. LULAC, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, \n895 (5th Cir. 1993) (Jones, J., concurring) (“The proper question is whether \nCongress intended to protect coalitions.”). \n8 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 16 of 35\n \nFourth, Plaintiffs play word games, contending that the phrase “a class of \ncitizens” “is not…singular.” Br. 22. But it is: “class” is singular. The phrase “of \ncitizens” is an adjectival phrase that limits “class” but cannot expand it or \ntransform its meaning. See Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 139 S. \nCt. 361, 368 (2018). Plaintiffs acknowledge as much by accurately creating \nsubject-verb agreement in that sentence, using the singular “is” to match the \nsingular noun “class,” not the plural “are” to match “citizens.” See Br. 22. In \nthis way, “the last antecedent grammatical rule,” Br. 23, supports Defendants, \nnot Plaintiffs, by treating the plural “citizens” as limiting, not expanding on \n“class.” See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) (applying the canon to a \n“limiting clause” (citation omitted)). And the singular-plural canon does not \napply here for the same reason it did not apply in Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 141 S. \nCt. 1474, 1482 (2021). That canon permits multiple classes to bring Section 2 \nsuits  together  or  separately,  but  “it  does  not  mean  a  [class]  can  consist  of \nmultiple” groups otherwise lacking claims. Id. \nFifth, Plaintiffs suggest that “the Supreme Court…recognizes coalition \nclaims.” Br. 24. It does not. See Growe, 507 U.S. at 41 (declining to decide the \nissue). The precedents Plaintiffs cite were joint or parallel claims, not coalition \nclaims. For example, the claim in Brnovich v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 141 S. Ct. \n2321  (2021),  was  that  precinct-voting  and  self-delivery  absentee  ballot \nrequirements burdened “Arizona’s American Indian, Hispanic, and African \nAmerican citizens,” id. at 2334, but each group could independently tender that \nallegation, and no aggregation was required to manufacture an otherwise non-\n9 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 17 of 35\n \nexistent claim. Likewise, the assertion in Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52 (1964), \nwas  intentional  discrimination,  which  does  not  require  a  50%  threshold \nshowing. Id. at 56-57. In Houston Lawyers’ Ass’n v. Attorney General of Texas, 501 \nU.S. 419 (1991), it was unclear whether the plaintiffs sought majority-Black and \nmajority-Hispanic  districts  or  coalition  districts,  and  the  distinction  was \nunnecessary to the decision. See id. at 422-25. Any “antecedent propositions” \nassumed but not  decided  in  these  decisions  do  not  control.  United States v. \nNorman, 935 F.3d 232, 241 (4th Cir. 2019). \n3.  Plaintiffs resort to legislative history, but when Nixon was decided, \nno  one  had  located  “any  direct  evidence  that  Congress  even  contemplated \ncoalition suits, far less intended them.” Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1387. Twenty-six years \nlater, Plaintiffs identify no oversight in this effort.  \nPlaintiffs cite a single reference to “Mexican Americans and blacks” in the \nsame sentence, but this accompanied the 1975 amendments. See Br. 26-27. It \nwas not until 1982 that Congress added the language Plaintiffs rely on here, \nestablishing  Section  2  effects  liability  “even  [in]  the  absence  of  proof  of \ndiscriminatory intent….” Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 383-84 (1991).4 Nor \ndoes the reference of two racial groups in one sentence move the needle for \nPlaintiffs’  argument,  since  it  is  equally  consistent  with  the  parallel  claims \n \n4 Plaintiffs’ argument based on verbiage in Chisom, see Br. 21, stands rejected in \nNixon, 76 F.3d at 1388-89. And Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), \nsupports Defendants, holding that “the ordinary public meaning of the statute’s \nlanguage at the time of the law’s adoption” controls. Id. at 1741. \n10 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 18 of 35\n \ninvolving independent injuries to both groups. The same can be said of the words \n“a fair chance to participate” in the 1982 amendments. Br. 27. “Legislative \nhistory…is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it.” Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, \n562 U.S. 562, 574 (2011). But Plaintiffs are simply “looking over a crowd and \npicking out [their] friends.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. \n546, 568 (2005) (citation omitted).  \n4.  Defendants’  opening  brief  (at 30) explained  that  the  handful  of \ndecisions recognizing coalition claims lack reasoned support. Plaintiffs’ brief \nconfirms  this.  It  references  the  decisions,  but  does  not  make  use  of  their \nreasoning, because there is precious little. Br. 24-25 & n.3. Undeterred, Plaintiffs \nask the Court to follow the “vast majority of courts” anyway. Br. 23 (boldface \nomitted). But the Court’s task is not “‘merely to count noses.’” Laskar v. Hurd, \n972 F.3d 1278, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \n937 F.3d 764, 785 (7th Cir. 2019)). It is quality, not quantity, that counts. If \nNixon is an “outlier,” as Plaintiffs say, Br. 25, it is so only in being thoroughly \nreasoned. \nPlaintiffs also resist the relevance of the holding in Bartlett and Hall that \nSection 2 does not “grant minority voters ‘a right to preserve their strength for \nthe purposes of forging an advantageous political alliance.’” Bartlett, 556 U.S. at \n14-15 (quoting Hall, 385 F.3d at 431). Defendants are correct that Bartlett “did \nnot address coalition districts,” but they cannot avoid its “reasoning.” Br. 30. \nBartlett’s logic that “[n]othing in § 2 grants special protection to a minority \ngroup’s right to form political coalitions[,]” applies equally here. Bartlett rejected \n11 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 19 of 35\n \nany Section 2 right “to join other voters—including other racial minorities, or \nwhites, or both—to reach a majority….” 556 U.S. at 14 (emphasis added). \nPlaintiffs  ignore  this  reasoning.  Nor  do  Plaintiffs  address  Defendants’ \nobservation  that  their  own evidentiary  showing  depends on white crossover \nvoting to establish performing districts. Opening Br. 29. \n5.  Plaintiffs do address Bartlett’s observation that construing Section 2 \nto compel multi-race districts “would result in a substantial increase in the \nnumber  of  mandatory  districts  drawn  with  race  as  ‘the predominant  factor \nmotivating…,’” 556 U.S. at 21-22 (citation omitted), but their argument makes \nlittle sense, Br. 28-29. They cannot deny that adding this class of claims would \nincrease the number of race-based districts—including, potentially, in Virginia \nBeach.  And,  whether  or  not  “[c]oalition  claims  encourage  cross-racial \npartnerships,”  this  certainly  does  not  “relieve  any  administrability  and \ndivisiveness concerns.” Br. 29. The problem is identifying whether those “cross-\nracial partnerships” actually exist, and that problem is even more pronounced \nwhere many races may have such partnerships than where two may. See Bartlett, \n556  U.S.  at  21.  Plaintiffs’  assertion  that  “[a]ddition  is  not  too  steep  an \nadministrative hurdle,” Br. 28, carries no credibility when their brief insists that \neven algebra is insufficient, see Br. 39-40, and that experts need “homogenous \nprecinct analysis, ecological regression (‘ER’), and ecological inference (‘EI’),” \nBr. 33, which are subject to manipulation, Br. 35-36, and fail to address small \ngroups, Br. 35. And any “objective, administrable rule,” Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 22, \nwould weed out the weak cases, such as this one.  \n12 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 20 of 35\n \n Recognizing coalition claims would place redistricting authorities in the \nimpossible position of “[r]acial gerrymandering” by creating coalition districts, \nid., or incurring Section 2 liability otherwise. See Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, \n2315  (2018)  (discussing  these  “competing  hazards  of  liability”  (citation \nomitted)).  Plaintiffs  retort  that  “Defendants’  misplaced  constitutional  and \nadministrability arguments would apply to single-race claims as much as to \ncoalition claims.” Br. 28. Not so. Coalition claims compound the problem of \nracial predominance in the way Bartlett warned crossover claims would. 556 \nU.S. at 21-22. Regardless, the Supreme Court just issued a stay of a Section 2 \ninjunction and took the exceptional step of granting certiorari before a district \ncourt’s  judgment  to  determine  whether  this  equal-protection  argument  does \napply to single-race claims. See Merrill v. Milligan, 2022 WL 354467 (U.S. Feb. \n7, 2022). \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Fails the Second Precondition \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to recognize coalitional classes that “share…the \nsame experience of being politically excluded ‘on account of race,’” Br. 22, but \nto excuse them from proving any such shared experience. It is untenable for \nthem  to  defend  coalition  claims  on  a  theory  of  shared  injury  without  any \nevidence regarding the voting patterns of two of the three groups in the putative \ncoalition. If coalitional claims are cognizable, a “‘higher-than-usual’ burden to \nprove…political cohesion” applies. Rodriguez v. Pataki, 308 F. Supp. 2d 346, 422 \n(S.D.N.Y.), aff’d, 543 U.S. 997 (2004) (citation omitted).  \n13 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 21 of 35\n \n1.  Plaintiffs Invoke the Wrong Legal Standard \nTo establish that one racial group—here, the Black group—shares an \nexperience of political exclusion with others—here, the Asian and Hispanic \ngroups—a  plaintiff  must  prove  that  “black-supported  candidates  receive  a \nmajority of the Hispanic and Asian vote.” Brewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 453 (5th \nCir. 1989). In turn, to show shared experience running in the other directions, \nthe plaintiff must prove that “Hispanic-supported candidates receive a majority \nof the black and Asian vote” and that “Asian-supported candidates receive a \nmajority of the black and Hispanic vote.” Id. No other legal test is conceptually \navailable. Opening Br. 31-32. \nPlaintiffs beg to differ, announcing that the “‘key’ Section 2 inquiry for \ncoalition  claims  is  whether  ‘the  minority  group  as  a  whole’  is  politically \ncohesive.” Br. 36 (citation omitted). But that does not even ask whether different \ngroups “share…the same experience of being politically excluded,” Br. 22, and \nattributes preferences of large groups to smaller groups. Under Plaintiffs’ test, a \nputative coalition comprising 90% Black voters and 10% Hispanic voters would \nbe a coalition on the strength of Black cohesion alone, even if every Hispanic \nvoted against Black-preferred candidates. That is not a shared experience, which \nis why courts have demanded proof that “blacks and Latinos…have the same \npreferred candidate.” Rodriguez, 308 F. Supp. at 443. \nThe district court’s special master, Dr. Grofman, recognized this, stating \nafter Brewer was decided: “[B]y failing to disaggregate, we might wrongly infer \nthat  neither  [alleged  coalitional  minority]  group  is  supporting  the  white \n14 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 22 of 35\n \ncandidate(s) when in fact one group may be giving most of its support to the \nwhite candidate(s).” Bernard Grofman, Voting Rights in A Multi-Ethnic World, \n13 Chicano-Latino L. Rev. 15, 24 (1993). Accordingly, Dr. Grofman opined that \nhe “would require that (1) each group usually supports viable candidates of its \nown race or ethnicity, and (2) each group usually supports viable candidates of \nthe other group….” Id. at 23 (footnotes admitted). Plaintiffs’ relaxed standard \nattributes preferences of larger groups to smaller groups in the undifferentiated \n“Minority” category. \nPlaintiffs have no conceptual or statutory response. They instead insist \nthat “cohesion is ‘a question of fact.’” Br. 36. But the standard of cohesion is not: \n“whether the court applied the correct burden of proof is a question of law \nsubject to plenary review.” Abbott, 138 S. Ct. at 2326. A finding “based on a \nmisunderstanding of what is meant by ‘political cohesiveness’” is a “legal” error. \nGomez v. City of Watsonville, 863 F.2d 1407, 1415 (9th Cir. 1988). And Plaintiffs \nprotest  too  much  in  criticizing  the  “single  cramped  statistical  framework \nDefendants propose.” Br. 37. Brewer’s framework is not “statistical,” and it is \nnot  “cramped”  to  demand  an  examination  of  Asians’  and  Hispanics’  own \ncandidate preferences where plaintiffs (who are not Asian or Hispanic) cry \ndiscrimination against Asians and Hispanics. Plaintiffs’ permissive approach \nwould enable members of one group to use others for the instrumental purpose \nof filling out a 50% racial quota regardless of those groups’ real interests. See \nLULAC, 986 F.2d at 786 n.43 (warning of this “risk”). For this reason, the \nSupreme Court warned that “there [is] quite obviously a higher-than-usual need \n15 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 23 of 35\n \nfor the second of the Gingles showings,” if coalition cases are even viable. Growe, \n507 U.S. at 41. Plaintiffs ignore that command.5 \nInstead, Plaintiffs charge Defendants with “misrepresentation” of Brewer, \nBr. 38, which is difficult to understand when Defendants simply quoted Brewer, \nOpening  Br.  31-32.  It  is  Plaintiffs  who  misrepresent  Brewer  by  cutting  its \nstatement “that minority groups may be aggregated” off from the remainder of \nthe sentence: “for purposes of asserting a Section 2 violation.” Brewer, 876 F.2d \nat 453; Br. 38. This referred to the Fifth Circuit’s recognition of coalition claims, \nbut the portion Defendants quoted refers to the standard of cohesion. Other \ncourts have read Brewer as Defendants do. See, e.g., Kumar v. Frisco Indep. Sch. \nDist., 476 F. Supp. 3d 439, 504 (E.D. Tex. 2020); Rollins v. Fort Bend Indep. Sch. \nDist., 1996 WL 560295, at *13 (S.D. Tex. June 30, 1994), aff’d, 89 F.3d 1205 (5th \nCir. 1996). \n2.  Plaintiffs’ Showing Falls Short of the Legal Standard \nPlaintiffs did not even arguably prove that the Asian, Hispanic, and Black \ngroups share experience of exclusion from the political process, even defined to \ninclude support for the same candidates. \na.  As in other cases finding no coalitional cohesion, “[n]o regression \nanalysis  was  presented  to  isolate  the  voting  patterns  of  Hispanic  voters  as \n \n5 Plaintiffs also have no response to Defendants’ point that their standard is more \nlenient than that which governs a single-race claim. Opening Br. 36. Whereas a \nplaintiff alleging a single-race Asian claim must show that the Asian group is \ncohesive, Plaintiffs disclaim any need to make this showing. \n16 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 24 of 35\n \ncompared to African-American voters” or to Asian voters. Rollins, 1996 WL \n560295, at *13. Thus, the “quantitative expert testimony at trial,” Br. 33, did not \nestablish that “black-supported candidates receive a majority of the Hispanic \nand Asian vote,” Brewer, 876 F.2d at 453. That evidence, Plaintiffs concede, “did \nnot  yield  specific  percentage  estimates  for  Hispanic  and  Asian  votes  for \nparticular election contests.” Br. 37. Like the district court, Plaintiffs contend \nonly “that the Minority Community is politically cohesive,” taken as a whole. \nBr. 33 (emphasis added); see also, e.g., id. at 34 (“the minority community votes \ncohesively”);  id.  at  37  (citing  evidence  “that  illustrated  the  Minority \nCommunity’s cohesion”). But what does that prove? Plaintiffs have no evidence \nthat the Asian community is cohesive, that the Hispanic community is cohesive, \nor that the three groups together are cohesive. Opening Br. 33-36. \nThus, Plaintiffs’ assertions carry no legal—or even logical—significance. \nIt does not matter that Dr. Spencer used “three standard statistical methods,” \nBr. 33, that “Dr. Spencer did not rely on any single statistical method,” Br. 35, \nor even that the district court “concluded that the evidence proved minority \ncohesion,” Br. 34. None of that addresses the right legal question. As Defendants \nexplained,  there  is  no  difference  between  Plaintiffs’  assertions  and  the \nunbelievable assertion that Republican and Democratic voters in Cleveland, \nDetroit, or Oakland are cohesive around Democratic candidates because, taken \ntogether, estimates show high support for Democratic candidates in those cities. \nOpening Br. 44. Aggregation hides, rather than reveals, the truth. \n17 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 25 of 35\n \nb.  Plaintiffs’  sole  attempt  to  overcome  this  problem  relies  on  Dr. \nSpencer’s  rejection  of  the  “linear”  bounds  of  his  own  ecological-regression \nmethod. Br. 35-36. The district court’s reliance on Dr. Spencer’s testimony—\ndisclosed for the first time at trial on newly scribbled charts—was legal and clear \nerror. Opening Br. 39-44. \nFirst, even if Dr. Spencer made a reliable showing “that Black voters \nexhibited similar voting preferences as the combined Minority Community,” Br. \n35,  the  legal  error  of  aggregation  would  not  be  overcome.  Dr.  Spencer’s \ndeparture from linearity still does not purport to examine Asian and Hispanic \nvoting preferences separately. This approach includes no point estimates for \nthese groups and fails to analyze whether their voting patterns merge or diverge. \nSecond, it was clearly erroneous for the district court to stand by this \ntestimony  because  the  court-appointed  special  master  rejected  it  as \n“mathematically  impossible.”  SJA285;  Opening  Br.  42-44.  Plaintiffs  accuse \nDefendants of citing “a single out-of-context sentence,” Br. 37, but Dr. Grofman \naddressed this issue fulsomely in (1) a full paragraph in his report, (2) a robust \nfootnote, (3) an entire appendix, and (4) another robust footnote. See SJA235 \n(footnote 15); SJA241 (paragraph D1); SJA284-85 (Appendix B); SJA284-85 \n(footnote 41). Dr. Grofman explained that it is not “statistically possible to \ndetermine the voting behavior in Virginia Beach of African-American, Asian-\nAmerican, and Hispanic populations individually,” and he “placed no reliance \non conclusions by experts for Defendants or experts for Plaintiffs about differences \nin voting behavior between the three groups or between any single group and \n18 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 26 of 35\n \nthe combined group.” SJA235 (emphasis added). The reference to “experts for \nPlaintiffs” was to Dr. Spencer’s rejection of linearity. Opening Br. 41.6 \nFurther,  Plaintiffs  take  Dr.  Grofman  out  of  context.  They  quote  his \nconclusion that there is “clear and compelling evidence for racially polarized \nvoting  in  Virginia  Beach,”  Br.  38  (quoting  SJA285),  but  omit  the  key \nqualification: “between White (non-Hispanic) and non-White voters,” SJA285 \n(boldface omitted). That is, he found cohesion “of the composite minority \ngroup as a whole.” SJA285; see also SJA240 (finding cohesion “when we look \nat the combined minority community”). Dr. Grofman treated this as sufficient \nonly because this amalgamation was the “group whose voting behavior Judge \nJackson asked me to examine,” SJA235, and because he felt obliged to “take as \ngiven  by  the  Court’s  opinion  that  the  relevant  voting  rights  pertain  to  the \ncombined  minority  community….”  SJA224.  But  Dr.  Grofman  disclaimed \ntaking a side in the “[l]egal issues” that “can only be addressed by the Court.” \nSJA342. As shown, his prior writing rejected Plaintiffs’ legal position. \nThird,  the  district  court  hardly  needed  Dr.  Grofman  to  debunk  Dr. \nSpencer’s  inferences  about  Asian  and  Hispanic  voting  behavior  when  Dr. \nSpencer  also  “concluded…it  is  mathematically  impossible  to  derive  voting \n \n6 Plaintiffs leverage Dr. Grofman’s analysis rejecting the algebraic method of \nDefendants’ expert, Dr. Kidd, Br. 39-40, but Defendants no longer rely on that \nmethod to show actual “voting behavior,” SJA235, but rather to show possible \nvoting behavior that Plaintiffs cannot rule out, see Opening Br. 34. Plaintiffs \nforget the parties are not similarly situated: the burden is theirs. Growe, 507 U.S. \nat 42. \n19 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 27 of 35\n \npatterns for each minority group separately.” Br. 37 (quotation marks omitted); \nsee also Br. 35. It was improper for Dr. Spencer to develop a novel method on the \nwitness stand through scribbled curves on charts to illustrate what he admitted \ncannot  be  proven.  Plaintiffs  acknowledge  that  “ER  assumes  a  linear \nrelationship,” Br. 35, so Dr. Spencer was not entitled to reject that assumption \nfor  some  purposes (all-minority  cohesion)  and  not  others  (Black  cohesion). \nOpening  Br.  40-41.  Plaintiffs  retort  that  his  result  “converged  with  the \nhomogenous precinct analysis,” Br. 40 n.9, but Dr. Grofman concluded “we \ncannot directly make use of the method of homogeneous precincts in the City of \nVirginia  Beach  to  assess  the  voting  behavior  of  the  separate  minority \ncommunities”  because  “[t]here  are  no  such  sufficiently  racially/ethnically \nhomogenous precinct in Virginia Beach” even for “the three groups combined.” \nSJA237. Dr. Spencer, too, admitted that homogenous precincts do not exist in \nVirginia Beach, rendering that method useless. JA0438-JA0440. \nPlaintiffs  ignore  that  the  methodological  limitations  Dr.  Spencer \npurported to correct ad hoc at trial were addressed by the leading expert Dr. Gary \nKing,  who  invented  ecological  inference  to  overcome  “the  assumption  of \nlinearity underpinning the ecological regression method.” Rodriguez v. Harris \nCty., 964 F. Supp. 2d 686, 759 (S.D. Tex. 2013), aff’d, 601 F. App’x 255 (5th Cir. \n2015).  King’s  method  is  “regarded  as  an  improvement  upon  ecological \nregression” for this reason. United States v. City of Eastpointe, 378 F. Supp. 3d 589, \n597 (E.D. Mich. 2019) (collecting cases). Dr. Spencer performed this method, it \n20 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 28 of 35\n \nis the method curing the linearity problem, but the results do not help Plaintiffs. \nOpening Br. 35, 41.  \nc.  Plaintiffs’ reliance on “qualitative evidence” fares no better. Br. 42. \nPlaintiffs argue only that the putative coalition “advocated together in at least \nseven categories.” Br. 43. But the cohesion question looks to “whether members \nof the minority usually vote for the same candidates.” Collins v. City of Norfolk, \n816 F.2d 932, 935 (4th Cir. 1987) (emphasis added). The district court “should \nhave looked only to actual voting patterns,” not to “socioeconomic” factors or \n“political opinion.” Gomez, 863 F.2d at 1416 (reversing a trial court for this \nerror); see also United States v. Blaine Cty., 363 F.3d 897, 910 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[I]t \nis actual voting patterns, not subjective interpretations of a minority group’s \npolitical interests, that informs the political cohesiveness analysis.”). Evidence \nof  purported  shared  issue  advocacy  is  meaningless  in  the  absence  of  any \nconnection to “the ‘voting preferences expressed in actual elections.’” Sanchez v. \nState of Colo., 97 F.3d 1303, 1312 (10th Cir. 1996); see also Campos v. City of \nBaytown, 840 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1988) (“[A] minority group is politically \ncohesive if it votes together.”). Plaintiffs respond that both “quantitative” and \n“qualitative” evidence is relevant, Br. 44, but that is not the issue. The problem \nis that their qualitative evidence does not prove different groups “often support \ndifferent [or the same] candidates,” Sanchez v. Bond, 875 F.2d 1488, 1493 (10th \nCir. 1989), which is the inquiry their authorities require, Br. 42-45. \nDefendants do not “ask[] this Court to draw different conclusions from \nthe record” than the district court’s, as Plaintiffs allege. Br. 45. Defendants’ \n21 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 29 of 35\n \nevidence speaks to the legally salient question of candidate support; Plaintiffs’ \ndoes not. The unrebutted testimony showed that the Filipino community—the \nCity’s largest Asian community—does not regularly support Black-preferred \ncandidates.  JA0858-60;  JA0334;  JA0359;  JA0717;  JA0722-23;  JA1003; \nJA2269-70; JA2293-94. It also showed that, even where the disparate groups \ncome together on a “specific issue,” they then “disperse and go about [their] \nbusiness.”  JA0190-91.  Plaintiffs’  witness—their  sole  witness  of  Asian  or \nHispanic  descent—Democratic  Del.  Kelly  Convirs-Fowler,  testified  that \nFilipino voters provide, for her, “crossover” support, an acknowledgment that \nthese voters ordinarily prefer Republicans. JA0322. The deficiency in Plaintiffs’ \nreliance on “seven categories” of issue advocacy is that “it is the plaintiff’s \nburden to show that voters in the minority group have a candidate…that the \ngroup would prefer to elect.” Mallory v. Ohio, 173 F.3d 377, 383 (6th Cir. 1999) \n(emphasis added) (citing Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 67-70 (1986)). \nAnd  Plaintiffs  cannot  credibly  call  unrebutted  evidence  that  Filipino \nvoters regularly vote for Republican candidates “irrelevant because the City \nCouncil elections are nonpartisan,” Br. 45, when Plaintiffs call it highly relevant \nthat “‘voters from the Minority Community strongly prefer Barack Obama over \nJohn McCain,’” Br. 34 (quoting JA1225). It is unlikely that a group polarized \nagainst the Black community in partisan races suddenly becomes cohesive in \nnon-partisan  races.  And,  because  Plaintiffs’  partisan  aggregate  “Minority” \nestimates hide the unrebutted fact that Filipinos vote Republican, there is every \nreason to suspect the same concealment is occurring in their aggregate estimates \n22 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 30 of 35\n \nof patterns in nonpartisan council races. This method buries Filipino preferences \nand silences their voices. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Fails the Third Precondition \nBecause the district court concluded that “50% of the minority-preferred \ncandidates have lost,” JA1232, Plaintiffs failed to prove that a cohesive white \nvoting  bloc  is  “usually…able  to  defeat”  the  minority  group’s  preferred \ncandidates, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 49. Plaintiffs ignore this finding and erroneously \ntry to explain away the many minority-preferred-candidate wins. Br. 46-47. Like \nthe district court, they argue that white minority-preferred candidates do not \ncount, id., and ignore this Court’s contrary holding in Lewis v. Alamance Cty., 99 \nF.3d 600, 607 (4th Cir. 1996). Opening Br. 47-48. \nPlaintiffs’ attempts to explain away the fact that two Black (and Black-\npreferred) members serve on the Council today are perplexing. Their contention \nthat these candidates received “unusually high and unprecedented support from \nwhite  voters,”  Br. 49 n.11,  wrongly  discounts highly  probative  evidence  of \n“substantial  crossover  voting,”  which  cuts  against  them  on  “third  Gingles \nprecondition.” Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 24. White support is a reason to count, not \ndiscount, these races.7 And Plaintiffs still have not explained how a lawsuit \nlacking  any  public  attention  prior  to  the  November  2019  council  election \n \n7 Plaintiffs’ argument that one candidate may have received support from “a \nprominent Republican organization,” Br. 49 n.11, contradicts their argument \nthat partisan information is “irrelevant.” Br. 45. \n23 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 31 of 35\n \nsomehow creates a special circumstance, offering only reasons it “could” be \nwithout cognizable evidence of what is. Br. 48.  \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Claim Fails the Totality of the Circumstances \nPlaintiffs’ arguments under the totality-of-the-circumstances further read \nany integrity out of coalition claims. To establish groups’ “same experience of \nbeing politically excluded,” Br. 22, there is no substitute for evidence that each \ngroup had the same experience, Opening Br. 50-51. Plaintiffs, however, can only \ncite vague references to “the entire coalition” in the opinion below, Br. 52, which \npurported  to  find  “each  factor…met,”  JA1238.  Plaintiffs  do  not  deny  that \n“Asian  students  perform  at  the  same,  or  higher,  rate  compared  to  white \nstudents,”  JA1249,  that  more  Asian  than  white  students  graduate  college, \nJA1250,  that  Asian  household  income  exceeds  white  household  income, \nJA1251,  that  white  and  Asian  home-ownership  rates  are  almost  identical. \nJA1252, that not a single Asian-American has lost any Virginia Beach race, \nJA1262,  or  that  “the  City…overutilized  Asian-American  owned  business.” \nJA1268. \nPlaintiffs try to divert the Court’s attention to “Black, Latino, and Asian-\nAmerican” statistics combined, Br. 53, which again attributes the experiences of \nsome  groups  to  others.  But  to  pretend  the  Asian,  Hispanic,  and  Black \nexperiences are “the same,” Br. 22, is a disservice to all groups. And it is \nPlaintiffs’ standard that would replace a searching local inquiry with a “stilted” \napproach, Br. 51-52, “viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms” and \nignoring  “divergent  communities  knitted  together  by  various  traditions  and \n24 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 74            Filed: 02/14/2022      Pg: 32 of 35\n \ncarried forth, above all, by individuals.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle \nSch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 723-24 (2007) (citation omitted).  \nIV.  The Injunction Is Indefinite \nThe injunction commanding the City to “comply with Section 2” as to \n“any practice, policy, procedure or other action,” JA1277, is an “‘obey the law’ \ninjunction[]” that is “unenforceable.” Fla. Ass’n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. State of \nFla. Dep’t of Health & Rehab. Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1222 (11th Cir. 2000). It is not \ntrue “that this Court has repeatedly approved…materially indistinguishable” \ninjunctions. Br. 54-55. Plaintiffs’ cited authorities merely enjoined “any further \nuse of the at-large system.” United States v. Charleston Cty., 316 F. Supp. 2d 268, \n307 (D.S.C. 2003), aff’d, S.C., 365 F.3d 341 (4th Cir. 2004); Collins v. City of \nNorfolk, 883 F.2d 1232, 1244 (4th Cir. 1989) (ordering lower court to “enjoin at-\nlarge elections”). \nPlaintiffs’ rhetoric that the injunction is not “burdensome” if the City \n“really intends to comply,” Br. 55 (citation omitted), means nothing in this \ncontext. The City can violate Section 2 without “intent,” Chisom, 501 U.S. at \n383, and even without volition if it is administering a state election law, Opening \nBr. 52. And Section 2 precedent has “engendered considerable disagreement and \nuncertainty regarding the nature and contours of a vote dilution claim.” Merrill, \n2022 WL 354467, at *4 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). This leaves the City—acting \nin  good  faith—no  meaningful  way  to  avoid  potentially  crushing  contempt \nsanctions.  Plaintiffs’  authority,  see  Br.  54-55,  addresses  different  statutory \nschemes lacking this acute indefiniteness problem and is not on point.

Democratic Nat’l \nComm., 141 S. Ct. 2321, 2330 (2021), by guaranteeing “the right of any \ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color” or status \nas a “language minority.” 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301(a), 10303(f)(2), 10310(c)(3). \nA state violates Section 2 of the VRA when members of a racial, ethnic, \nor language minority group—a protected “class of citizens” under that \nsection—are denied equal participation in elections. Id. § 10301(b); see \nalso, e.g., Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 35 (1986) (suing to enforce \nrights of “black citizens of North Carolina”); Cross v. Fox, --- F. 4th ---, \n2022 WL 127944, at *1 (8th Cir. 2022) (suing to enforce the rights of \n“Members of an Indian tribe”); Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 406 \n(9th  Cir.  2012)  (addressing  whether  state  law  “disparately  impacts \nLatino voters”).  \nSection 2 does not contemplate “coalitions” formed from multiple \nminority groups putatively bringing suit as a single Section 2 “class of \ncitizens,” and the Supreme Court has never accepted the coalition theory \nembraced by the district court. See Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41 \n1 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 7 of 24 Total Pages:(7 of 25)\n(1993) (“[a]ssuming (without deciding) that it was permissible for the \n[d]istrict [c]ourt to combine distinct ethnic and language minority groups \nfor purposes of assessing compliance with § 2,” and reversing on other \ngrounds). This Court should not accept the coalition theory either: the \ntext  and  structure  of  the  VRA,  as  well  as  the  consequences  and \nconstitutional difficulties engendered by the coalition theory, all require \nreversal.  \nEven if the VRA did permit coalition standing in some cases, it \nwould not do so here. The plaintiffs’ challenge to Virginia Beach’s defunct \nelection plan is moot, see Defs. Br. at 15–18, and the plaintiffs—two black \nresidents  of  Virginia  Beach—cannot  assert  the  interests  of  a  large, \ngeographically dispersed, and politically disparate coalition comprising \nmultiple racial, ethnic, and language minority groups, see id. 18–24. The \ndistrict court assumed, in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence, \nthat  all  minority  voters  in  Virginia  Beach  have  the  same  political \npreferences and voting behavior. Id. at 35–46. That perverse assumption \nmust be corrected because it relies on and perpetuates racial and ethnic \nstereotypes inimical to the VRA. See Emison, 507 U.S. at 42 (“Section 2 \n2 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 8 of 24 Total Pages:(8 of 25)\n‘does not assume the existence of racial bloc voting; plaintiffs must prove \nit.’” (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46)). \nThis Court should accordingly vacate the district court’s injunction \nand dismiss this case with prejudice. \nIDENTITY AND INTERESTS OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \n \n  Amicus  curiae  the  Commonwealth  of  Virginia  has  interests  in \nprotecting  its  citizens’  voting  rights  and  ensuring  its  localities’ \ncompliance  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act.  Plaintiffs’  coalition  theory \ndistorts Section 2 and will undermine the fairness of Virginia’s elections \nby  requiring  Virginia  Beach  to  treat  nonparty  members  of  plaintiffs’ \nputative coalition as if they share plaintiffs’ political preferences. In fact, \nthe undisputed record evidence shows that at least some members of the \ncoalition do not support the same candidates or have the same political \ngoals  as  the  two  individual  plaintiffs  who  claim  to  represent  them. \nIndeed,  the  Attorney  General  was  elected  as  Virginia  Beach’s  first \nCuban-American member of the House of Delegates—and is now the first \nthe Hispanic statewide officeholder—notwithstanding his affiliation with \n \n \n1  This  brief  is  filed  under  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure \n29(a)(2). \n3 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 9 of 24 Total Pages:(9 of 25)\nthe  political  party  which,  according  to  the  plaintiffs,  the  coalition \ncomprising Hispanic voters does not support.  \nVirginia agrees with the arguments advanced by Virginia Beach \nand submits this brief to express concern regarding the district court’s \nerroneous  holding,  which,  if  affirmed,  could  reverberate  across  the \nCommonwealth and beyond. \nARGUMENT \n  As the City explains in its brief, the district court’s jurisdictional \nerrors  require  vacatur  because  plaintiffs’  complaint  is  directed  at  a \ndefunct  election  plan  and  because  plaintiffs,  two  black  voters,  lack \nstanding to bring coalition claims on behalf of absent Hispanic and Asian \nvoters. See Defs. Br. at 15–24. If the Court were to reach the merits, \nhowever, the coalition theory embraced by the district court must be \nrejected. Coalition claims are not cognizable under Section 2, and, even \nif they were, plaintiffs cannot meet the strong showing of group cohesion \nthat a coalition claim would require. \nI.     Coalition Claims Are Not Cognizable Under Section 2. \nSection 2 of the VRA prohibits any “standard, practice, or procedure \n. . .  which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of \n4 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 10 of 24 Total Pages:(10 of 25)\nthe United States to vote on account of race or color,” or on account of \n“member[ship] [in] a language minority group.”2 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301(a), \n10303(f)(2).  The  statute  requires  a  court  to  evaluate  “the  totality  of \ncircumstances” in order to determine whether “the political processes \nleading to nomination or election . . . are not equally open to participation \nby members of a class of citizens” described above, “in that its members \nhave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate \nin the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” Id. \n§ 10301(b).  \n  1.   The text of Section 2 precludes the district court’s coalition \ntheory, because the statute’s reference to “members of a class of citizens” \ncannot be stretched to allow a claim by a coalition of multiple classes of \ncitizens. See Nixon v. Kent County, 76 F.3d 1381, 1386–87 (6th Cir. 1996) \n(en banc). Rather, a minority group’s claims under Section 2 must stand \nor fall on their own.  \n \n \n2  “‘[L]anguage  minorities’  or  ‘language  minority  group’  means \npersons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or \nof Spanish heritage.” 52 U.S.C. § 10310(c)(3). \n5 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 11 of 24 Total Pages:(11 of 25)\na.  Section  2  calls  for  a  comparison  of  the  “opportunit[ies]” \nafforded  to  members  of  a  protected  class  to  those  afforded  to  “other \nmembers  of  the  electorate”—necessarily  including  members  of  other \nminority groups. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). By instead including the members \nof virtually every other sizable minority group in Virginia Beach in the \nplaintiff coalition, the district court twisted the VRA’s text to create a \ncomparison between the aggregate membership of every minority group \nagainst a single comparator: white citizens. But if the VRA had intended \nsuch a comparison, Congress would have said so. Nixon, 76 F.3d at 1390–\n91. It was not reasonable for the district court to create an artificial \ncoalition of members of disparate minority groups and to assume, without \nany record evidence for support, that the interests and voting preferences \nof the coalition are distinct from those of white citizens. \nb.   The  coalition  theory  is  further  undermined  by  Section  2’s \nseparate identification of each group of protected language minorities \n(“American  Indian,  Asian  American,  Alaskan  Natives  or  of  Spanish \nheritage”). 52 U.S.C. § 10310(c)(3). Congress’s careful identification of \nthese protected classes indicates that “Congress considered members of \neach group and the group itself to possess homogeneous characteristics \n6 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 12 of 24 Total Pages:(12 of 25)\n[and] . . . did not envision that each defined group might overlap with any \nof the others or with [other racial minorities].” League of United Latin \nAm. Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 894 (5th Cir. \n1993) (en banc) (“LULAC II”) (Jones, J., concurring).  \n2.  If the textual basis for rejecting the coalition theory were not \nenough, the Court must also consider that coalition claims are “fraught \nwith risks.” League of United Latin Am. Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. \nClements, 986 F.2d 728, 785 n.43 (5th Cir. 1993) (“LULAC I”).  \na.  Treating  “a  group  composed  of  . . .  minorities”  as  “itself  a \nprotected minority” will ensnare the courts in a guessing game of racial \nassumptions. Campos v. City of Baytown, 849 F.2d 943, 945 (5th Cir. \n1988) (Higginbotham, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \n“Once the courts plunge into the business of apportioning representation \namong  racial  or  ethnic  coalitions,  a  host  of  difficult  and  potentially \ndivisive social questions rear their heads.” LULAC II, 999 F.2d at 897 \n(Jones, J., concurring).  \nIn this case, plaintiffs are two black citizens of Virginia Beach who \nassert claims on behalf of a coalition of black and nonblack minority \ncitizens. But unrebutted record evidence shows that not all members of \n7 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 13 of 24 Total Pages:(13 of 25)\nplaintiffs’ putative coalition share the same political goals or candidate \npreferences. Defs. Br. at 6. Filipino voters in Virginia Beach, for example, \ntend to prefer Republican candidates and support conservative social \npolicies.  Id.  Further,  there  may  be  additional  divisions  within  the \nputative coalition beyond those in the record. See LULAC II, 999 F.2d at \n897  &  n.9  (Jones,  J.,  concurring)  (“[S]ociological  literature  . . . \ndemonstrates ‘social distance’ between minority groups.”). By glossing \nover the strong and genuine disagreements between members of different \nminority groups, the district court “fashioned [relief] only because of the \ngroups’  joint  minority  status”—which,  perversely,  is  itself  a  form  of \ndiscrimination, and “a cruel hoax upon those who are not cohesive with \nself-styled minority spokesmen.” Id. at 896–97. \nb.  It is not sufficient in this case to respond that courts could \navoid  this  trap  by  requiring  evidence  of  the  voting  patterns  of  each \nminority group within the proposed coalition. Here, plaintiffs failed to \nput forward any evidence of Hispanic and Asian voting patterns, and the \nspecial  master  appointed  by  the  district  court  concluded  that  it  was \nimpossible to develop reliable statistical evidence of Hispanic and Asian \nvoting  patterns  due  to  those  groups’  relatively  small  populations  in \n8 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 14 of 24 Total Pages:(14 of 25)\nVirginia Beach. Defs. Br. at 13–14. That difficulty is well documented in \nother cases, as well, “suggest[ing], if not the utter bankruptcy of Section \n2 minority coalition claims, . . . at least their factual complexity.” See \nLULAC II, 999 F.2d at 897 (Jones, J., concurring).  \nc.  As this Court has already recognized, “any construction of \nSection 2 that authorizes the vote dilution claims of multiracial coalitions \nwould  transform  the  Voting  Rights  Act  from  a  law  that  removes \ndisadvantages  based  on  race,  into  one  that  creates  advantages  for \npolitical coalitions that are not so defined.” Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.3d 421, \n431 (4th Cir. 2004). In Hall, plaintiffs alleged a “crossover” theory that, \nin a newly drawn congressional district, “blacks are too small in number \nto form the same winning coalition with ‘crossover’ white voters that \nexisted before” the creation of the new district. Id. at 425. Similarly, the \ncoalition plaintiffs here have no “potential to elect a candidate on the \nstrength of their own ballots.” Id. at 429. Plaintiffs instead may elect their \npreferred candidates only by “join[ing] their political hands” with other \ngroups—Asian, Hispanic, White, or others. League of United Latin Am. \nCitizens, Council No. 4386 v. Midland Indep. Sch. Dist., 812 F.2d 1494, \n9 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 15 of 24 Total Pages:(15 of 25)\n1505 (5th Cir.) (Higginbotham, J., dissenting), opinion vacated on reh’g, \n829 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nPermitting plaintiffs’ coalition claims would therefore grant them \n“a  right  to  preserve  their  strength  for  the  purposes  of  forging  an \nadvantageous political alliance,” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 14–15 \n(2009)  (plurality  opinion)  (quoting  Hall,  385  F.3d  at  431),  thus \nvindicating their “ability to form a political coalition with other racial or \nethnic groups,” rather than creating any “potential to form a majority in \na district,” Hall, 385 F.3d at 431. But “Section 2 does not create an \nentitlement  for  minorities  to  form  an  alliance  with  other  voters  in  a \ndistrict who do not share the same statutory disability as the protected \nclass.” Id. at 431 n.13; see also Campos, 849 F.2d at 945 (Higginbotham, \nJ.,  dissenting  from  denial  of  rehearing  en  banc)  (“A  group  tied  by \noverlapping  political  agendas  but  not  tied  by  the  same  statutory \ndisability is no more than a political alliance or coalition.”). The same \ndifficulty that caused this Court to reject the crossover claim in Hall \nshould also cause it to reject plaintiffs’ coalition claim in this case.  \nd.  Judicially enlarging Section 2 to authorize coalition claims \nwould  also  raise  constitutional  concerns.  Congress  “retained  the \n10 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 16 of 24 Total Pages:(16 of 25)\nstatutory  language  restricting  relief  under  [Section]  2  to  ‘denials  or \nabridgments of the right to vote on account of race or color.’” LULAC II, \n999 F.2d at 854 (alterations omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1982)). \n“This limitation was not so much the product of legislative discretion as \nconstitutional imperative, given that the scope of Congress’[s] remedial \npower under the Civil War Amendments is defined in large part by the \nwrongs they prohibit.” Id. At bottom, coalition claims are problematic \nbecause they loosen the ties between Section 2 and race or color, risking \nthe possibility of plaintiffs using Section 2 to prosecute grievances beyond \nwhat is permitted by the Constitution or the VRA. \nII.    Even Assuming Section 2 Did Allow Coalitional Standing, It Would \nRequire A Strong Showing Of Cohesion That Plaintiffs Have Not \nMade And Cannot Make. \nEvidence  of  “minority  political  cohesion”  is  a  prerequisite  to  a \nSection 2 claim. Emison, 507 U.S. at 40; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 31. Before \na court can “combine distinct ethnic and language minority groups for \npurposes  of  assessing  compliance  with  [Section]  2,”  “there  [is]  quite \nobviously  a  higher-than-usual  need”  for  the  plaintiff  to  make  this \nshowing. Emison, 507 U.S. at 41; see also LULAC II, 999 F.2d at 898 \n(Jones, J., concurring) (“At the very least, only under very convincing \n11 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 17 of 24 Total Pages:(17 of 25)\nproof of a minority coalition’s sociological similarities and goals as well \nas its political cohesion can such a claim be made.”). In Emison, the \nSupreme Court rejected the plaintiffs’ claims because “the record simply \n‘contains no statistical evidence’ of minority political cohesion (whether \nof one or several minority groups).” 507 U.S. at 41 (quoting Emison v. \nGrowe, 782 F. Supp. 427, 436 n.30 (D. Minn. 1992), rev’d, 507 U.S. 25, \n(1993)). \nSo too here. In fact, the unrebutted record evidence shows that the \npolitical preferences of the groups in plaintiffs’ putative coalition are \ndiverse and frequently conflicting. Virginia Beach’s Filipino community, \nthe  City’s  largest  Asian  population,  for  example,  backs  Republican \ncandidates  and  conservative  policies,  while  the  black  community \ntypically  supports  Democrat  candidates  and  progressive  policies. \nCompare J.A. 322, 1003, 2269–2270, 2293–2294, with J.A. 713; see also \nJ.A. 860. Tellingly, no member of Virginia Beach’s Hispanic or Asian \ncommunities  joined  plaintiffs’  suit,  and  nothing  in  the  record  even \nindicates that plaintiffs asked any member of those communities to do so. \nSee J.A. 171, 524. On this record, “[s]ince a court may not presume bloc \nvoting within even a single minority group, it made no sense for the \n12 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 18 of 24 Total Pages:(18 of 25)\n[d]istrict [c]ourt to (in effect) indulge that presumption as to bloc voting \nwithin an agglomeration of distinct minority groups.” Emison, 507 U.S. \nat 41 (citation omitted).  \nAccordingly, even if the Court were to overlook the jurisdictional \ndefects in the district court’s decision, and even if the Court were to \nembrace a coalition theory of Section 2, plaintiffs’ claims must still fail, \nbecause  they  cannot  make,  and  have  not  tried  to  make,  the  strong \nshowing  of  cohesion  required  to  advance  a  coalition  claim  under  the \nVoting Rights Act.  \n*** \nThe district court’s agglomeration of a diverse set of “non-white” \ncommunities, Holloway v. City of Virginia Beach, 531 F. Supp. 3d 1015, \n1048 (E.D. Va. 2021), into a single racial “class” for purposes of the VRA \nin this case demonstrates the obvious danger of stretching the text of \nSection 2 beyond what Congress intended. Virginia Beach, like the rest \nof the Commonwealth and the country, is composed of diverse ethnic, \nracial, religious, and linguistic communities. They are distinct from each \nother. They are shaped by their respective heritages, experiences, and \ntraditions. Communities of recently arrived immigrants, for example, \n13 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 19 of 24 Total Pages:(19 of 25)\nhave a different American experience than communities that have been \nin North America for centuries. Bilingual communities have a different \nAmerican  experience  than  those  who  speak  primarily  English.  And \ncommunities who practice a minority religion, like Roman Catholicism, \nhave a different American experience than those who do not.  \nThose experiences inform and shape the “distinctive minority group \ninterests”  of  those  communities.  Gingles,  487  U.S.  at  51.  The  rich \ndiversity  across  minority  communities  in  Virginia  Beach  and  the \nCommonwealth weighs heavily in favor of honoring Congress’s expressed \nintention to limit Section 2 claims only to those brought by individual \nminority groups.  \nBut even if this Court were to recognize coalition claims, it should \ndo so only in the presence of overwhelming evidence of political cohesion \namong the constituent groups of the coalition. Demanding anything less \nwould  erase  the  unique  heritages  and  experiences  of  the  varying \nmembers of the putative coalition and subordinate their “distinctive . . . \ninterests,” id., to those of the most powerful group in the coalition, see \nLULAC I, 986 F.2d at 785 n.43.  \n14 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 20 of 24 Total Pages:(20 of 25)\nThat  is  precisely  what  the  district  court  did  here.  The  record \ncontains no evidence that Asian and Hispanic voters share the sorts of \ninterests with black voters that would make them a cohesive voting bloc \nin Virginia Beach. In fact, the evidence points the other way. The district \ncourt therefore combined Asian and Hispanic voters into a coalition with \nblack voters based on their shared status as “non-white” rather than on \ntheir actual political interests. It reduced the diverse coalition members \nto a mass of persons who are not the majority race, rather than seriously \nengaging with the unique qualities of each community.  \nThe  district  court’s  approach  is  dangerous.  The  Supreme  Court \nexplained  nearly  thirty  years  ago  that  combining  “in  one  district \nindividuals who belong to the same race, but who are otherwise widely \nseparated by geographical and political boundaries, and who may have \nlittle in common with one another but the color of their skin, bears an \nuncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.” Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S.  630,  647  (1993).  Doing  so  “reinforces  . . .  impermissible  racial \nstereotypes” that “members of the same racial group—regardless of their \nage, education, economic status, or the community in which they live—\nthink alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same \n15 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 58-1            Filed: 01/21/2022      Pg: 21 of 24 Total Pages:(21 of 25)\ncandidates at the polls.” Id. The district court’s approach here flouts \nShaw’s  exhortation.  It  treats  diverse  groups  of  “non-white”  voters—\nregardless  of  age,  education,  economic  status,  heritage,  language,  or \nreligion—as  thinking  alike,  sharing  the  same  political  interests,  and \npreferring the same candidates merely because they are not white.  \n   “It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.” League of \nUnited Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 511 (2006) (Roberts, \nC.J.,  concurring  in  part,  concurring  in  the  judgment  in  part,  and \ndissenting  in  part).  The  district  court’s  reasoning  made  this  sordid \nbusiness much worse. The Court should reject it.  \nCONCLUSION \n  The  injunction  should  be  vacated,  and  the  case  remanded  with \ninstructions that this case be dismissed or, alternatively, that judgment \nbe entered for Defendants. \nRespectfully submitted,  \nBy:  /s/ Andrew N.

Through its Democracy Program, the \nBrennan Center works to eliminate participation barriers, and ensure public \ninstitutions reflect the diverse voices and interests that make for a rich and \nenergetic democracy.1 The Brennan Center has long focused on rooting out \ndiscrimination in voting and representation, producing extensive scholarship and \nempirical research on relevant subjects and appearing as counsel and amici in \nvoting rights litigation in state and federal court. This brief addresses the text, \npurpose, and legislative history of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to \ndemonstrate its consistency with minority coalition claims. \nAmicus Southern Coalition for Social Justice (“SCSJ”) is a 501(c)(3) \nnonprofit public interest law organization founded in 2007 in Durham, North \nCarolina. SCSJ partners with communities of color and economically \ndisadvantaged communities in the south to defend and advance their political, \nsocial, and economic rights through the combination of legal advocacy, research, \n                                                 \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no party or its \ncounsel made a monetary contribution intended to fund its preparation or \nsubmission.

One of amicus’ primary practice areas is voting \nrights. Amicus has represented individual and organizational clients in redistricting \ncases across the South and in the Fourth Circuit, including North Carolina, South \nCarolina, and Virginia. Amicus SCSJ frequently represents clients in cases brought \nunder the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) and Fourteenth Amendment \nchallenging redistricting plans and voting laws and practices that abridge voting, \nregistration, or fair representation for all eligible voters in an increasingly diverse \nSouth.   \nINTRODUCTION  \n  This case involves claims brought by minority voters under Section 2 of the \nVRA arguing that the use of at-large elections for the Virginia Beach City Council \ndilutes their votes. The VRA is a landmark piece of legislation since its enactment \nin 1965, and Section 2 in particular has a long and storied role in ensuring that no \nAmerican citizen is denied the right to vote “on account of race or color or in \ncontravention of the guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2).” 52 U.S.C. § \n10301(a).  \nThe statute’s text and history shed light on the intentions and aims of \nCongress in its drafting. As discussed infra, Congress sought to make Section 2 \navailable to individuals who suffered discrimination at the voting booth, whether \nas one racial group or as part of a minority coalition. Several factors point toward \n2 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 11 of 42\n \nthis conclusion, including the plain language of Section 2, as well as the proper \nreading of the phrase “members of a class of citizens” and the definition of “class.” \nIn addition, the legislative history of the VRA, and its enforcement history, \ndemonstrate that minority coalitions are in harmony with Congress’ intent in \npassing the VRA and drafting Section 2. Finally, Congress and the courts have \nestablished a robust and fact-intensive framework for evaluating Section 2, which \ncan resolve claims of vote dilution brought by minority coalitions. Taken as a \nwhole, these arguments give weight to coalition claims as a suitable mechanism to \nfight vote dilution for multiple minority groups. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The text and purpose of the VRA support minority coalitions. \nSection 2(a) of the VRA prohibits state and local policies “imposed or \napplied . . . in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any \ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention \nof the guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2).” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Section \n10303(f)(2),2 in turn, prohibits policies that “deny or abridge the right of any \ncitizen of the United States to vote because he is a member of a language minority \ngroup.” Subsection (b) from 1982 describes how a violation of subsection (a), \nwhich incorporates section 10303(f)(2), can be proven:  \n                                                 \n2 52 U.S.C. § 10303(f)(2) corresponds to Section 4(f)(2) of the VRA. \n3 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 12 of 42\n \nA violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, it is shown that . . . members \nof a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) . . . have \nless opportunity than other members of the electorate to \nparticipate  in  the  political  process  and  to  elect \nrepresentatives of their choice. . . . \n52 U.S.C. § 10301(b) (emphasis added).  \nAt issue is the effect of the phrase “members of a class of citizens protected \nby subsection (a).” Appellants (collectively, “the City”) urge that “class” be read to \nmean citizens with “a common racial heritage and shared American experience.” \nCity’s Am. Br. 24. On this reading, a plaintiff alleging discrimination “on account \nof race or color,” such as her status as a person of color, can only assert a claim if \nthe injury is limited to her specific racial group—even if all citizens of color are \nsimilarly affected. The same is true of a plaintiff alleging discrimination because \nshe “is a member of a language minority group.” \nUnder the VRA, “class” refers to the group of citizens similarly injured \nunder subsection (a). If a plaintiff’s right to vote is abridged solely on account of \nher being Black, then the relevant “class of citizens” is based solely on her \npersonal race: similarly affected Black citizens. But if a Black plaintiff’s right to \nvote is abridged because she is a person of color and not white, then the relevant \nclass is similarly-injured citizens of color, irrespective of the individual voter’s \nrace. The boundaries of the relevant “class” depend on the allegations and facts in \na particular case.  \n4 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 13 of 42\n \nThis reading reflects Congress’s recognition—and the country’s \nexperience—that discrimination based on race, color, and language can have many \nvictims. The prejudice behind discriminatory policies often did not target those \nvictims with precision, but instead reflected “the doctrine of White Supremacy,” \nwhich divides citizens simply into white and non-white. See Loving v. Virginia, \n388 U.S. 1, 7 (1967).  \nThis reading of “class,” which is the heart of all coalitional claims, is \nsupported by the text and purpose of Section 2, as detailed below: \n•  Statutes should be read to give effect to all their terms. The City’s \nreading rewrites Section 2 to limit its reach to policies that injure \ndiscrete groups delineated by “a common racial heritage and shared \nAmerican experience,” City’s Am. Br. 24, regardless of the facts in a \nparticular case. This would effectively delete Section 2’s references to \nlanguage minority status and “color.” By contrast, reading “class” in \nsubsection (b) as fact-specific would preserve subsection (a) and \nreflect the intended function of subsection (b) as clarifying how a \nsubsection (a) violation can be proven.  \n•  Section 4(f) of the VRA shows that Congress knows how to require \nthis kind of evidence when intended to limit it to a single language \n5 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 14 of 42\n \nminority. The fact that Congress wrote Section 2 differently suggests \na difference in meaning. \n•  When Congress uses terms with settled common-law meanings, those \nmeanings should be applied. The common-law meaning of “class,” \nespecially in the context of civil-rights actions, refers to persons \nsimilarly injured. This is how “class” was used in the Supreme Court \nopinions that informed Congress’s drafting of subsection (b) in 1982.  \n•  The purpose of the VRA is to remedy the race-, color-, and language-\nbased dilution of voting strength. The City’s reading would disserve \nthis purpose and lead to absurd consequences that Congress did not \nintend: allowing equally discriminatory policies with identical effects \non citizens of color to receive different treatment based on the number \nof racial groups that those citizens of color comprise. \nA.  The VRA’s text protects minority coalitions. \nIf possible, statutes should be read such that “no clause, sentence, or word \nshall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001). Subsection (a) prohibits abridgements “on account of race or color” or \nmembership in a language minority group. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Under the City’s \ninterpretation, a plaintiff may only prove a claim by showing its effect on her \nparticular racial or ethnic group—the group with which she shares “a common \n6 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 15 of 42\n \nracial heritage and shared American experience.” City’s Am. Br. 24. This \neffectively erases subsection (a)’s reference to language minority groups through \nits incorporation of Section 4(f)(2), as well as its separate reference to “color.” \nUnder the City’s reading, these references would become surplusage.  \nWhile race, color, and language minority status surely can overlap, Congress \ndid not use the three references to mean the same thing. Nor did it use “color” or \n“language minority group” to indicate merely a subset of a specific racial group. \nThe word “or,” which separates the three references, does not mean “including”—\nit is “almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given \nseparate meanings.” Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351, 357 (2014). A single \nlanguage can be spoken by members of different racial groups and one racial group \ncan have multiple dominant languages. The City’s interpretation does not \nacknowledge this reality. Plus, as this Court has recognized, race-based and color-\nbased discrimination are two different things. Bryant v. Bell Atlantic Md., Inc., 288 \nF.3d 124, 132 n.5 (4th Cir. 2002). Considering the history of discrimination that \ncategorized citizens as “white” and “non-white”, discrimination based on color can \naffect all citizens of color, including citizens of different races.  \nWhen possible, statutory provisions should be read “harmoniously,” \nespecially when addressing the same subject. Anderson v. FDIC, 918 F.2d 1139, \n1143 (4th Cir. 1990). The City’s reading of “class” in subsection (b) conflicts with \n7 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 16 of 42\n \nsubsection (a)’s references to minority-language status, as well as its reference to \n“color.” The correct reading harmonizes the two sections, recognizing that “class” \nin subsection (b) refers to the group of persons similarly injured, whether by race-, \ncolor-, or language-based discrimination.  \nIn harmony, subsection (b) establishes the results-based orientation of the \ninquiry and elaborates the proof required to show a violation of subsection (a)—it \ndoes not limit subsection (a)’s scope. As Congress clarified in the 1982 \namendments, subsection (a) requires a plaintiff to prove: (1) a denial or \nabridgement of the right of any citizen to vote; and (2) that the harm is the \ncombination of the effects of the challenged policy and the plaintiff’s “race or \ncolor” or (by reference) membership in “a language minority group.” 52 U.S.C. § \n10301(a), 10303(f)(2). Subsection (b) then clarifies that the first element required \nby subsection (a), an abridgement of the right to vote, can be established by \nshowing differences in electoral outcomes. It also provides that the second causal \nelement can be proven by looking to citizens similarly situated to the plaintiff—to \nwhether voters in the same “class” as the plaintiff are less able to elect their chosen \ncandidates. Subsection (b) does not limit subsection (a); rather, it describes how \nthe causal impact of race or color can be proven—by looking to voters who share \nthat characteristic to see if they are similarly disadvantaged. In Thornburg v. \nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 48-51 (1986), the Supreme Court elaborated the threshold \n8 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 17 of 42\n \nproof required when applying this statutory structure to multimember districts. The \nCourt’s analysis did not require that all class members belong to a single racial \nminority. See Appellee’s Resp. Br. 21-23; infra at 19-22. \nNevertheless, the City effectively asks this Court to amend Section 2(b) in \nthe following way: \nA violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, it is shown that . . . members \nof a class of citizens single racial minority protected by \nsubsection  (a)  .  .  .  have  less  opportunity  than  other \nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political \nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice. . . . \nIf Congress wanted to single out specific groups in this way, it would have done so \nexpressly—as it did in Section 4(f)(3) of the VRA, which prohibits states and \nlocalities from providing voting materials  \nonly in the English language, where the Director of the \nCensus determines that more than five per centum of the \ncitizens of voting age residing in such State or political \nsubdivision are members of a single language minority.  \n52 U.S.C. § 10303(f)(3) (emphasis added).  \n“[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another,” then Congress presumptively “intended a difference in \nmeaning.” Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 358; see also Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. \nNassar, 570 U.S. 338, 357 (2013) (same for differences in rights provisions among \ncivil-rights statutes). In Section 4(f)(3), Congress provided that a violation is \n9 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 18 of 42\n \nestablished by looking to the size of a “single” group. But it did not do so in \nSection 2, which cites Section 4(f)(2), and looks not at a single group, but instead \nto the injury suffered by a “class of citizens protected by subsection (a).”  \nCongress was not ignorant of this difference. The 1982 amendments that \nadded Section 2(b) also amended Section 4(f)—indeed, Congress amended 4(f)(4) \nto clarify the rights of “Alaskan Natives and American Indians” to certain \nassistance, specifying those groups by name. See Voting Rights Act Amendments \nof 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-205, § 2(c), 96 Stat. 133-34. The fact that Congress chose \nnot to refer to racial, ethnic, or other groupings in its amendment to Section 2 is \n“particularly telling.” See Baker Botts L.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 129 \n(2015). Congress used different language in Sections 2(b) and 4(f), and the \ninterpretation of those sections should respect that choice. \nApplying the last-antecedent rule also indicates that the VRA defines the \nscope of protection as citizens because the term “citizens” and not “class” is the \nlast antecedent before the relevant limiting phrase in subsection (b). See Lockhart \nv. United States, 577 U.S. 347, 351 (2016) (describing the last-antecedent \npresumption); Kevin Sette, Are Two Minorities Equal to One?, 88 Fordham L. \nRev. 2693, 2727 (2020) (applying it to Section 2(b)). Thus, the last-antecedent rule \nfurther establishes that the relevant class for purposes of subsection (b) consists of \ncitizens covered by the common injury defined in subsection (a): those suffering \n10 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 19 of 42\n \nvoting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or language minority status. \nNothing in the text of Section 2 otherwise limits “class.” As the Supreme Court \nobserved with respect to Title VII, there is no such thing as “a ‘canon of donut \nholes,’ in which Congress’s failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls \nwithin a more general statutory rule creates a tacit exception.” Bostock v. Clayton \nCty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1747 (2020). The same applies to Section 2. \nSuch interpretation of “class” is also consistent with the term’s common-law \norigins and use in civil rights litigation. Unless Congress directs otherwise, the \ncourts presume that “a statutory term has its common-law meaning.” Scheidler v. \nNat’l Org. for Women, Inc., 537 U.S. 393, 402 (2003). The history of the term \n“class” in the civil-rights context is closely tied to the federal class action. Indeed, \nby the time Section 2(b) was enacted in 1982, class actions were a common \nmechanism for civil-rights plaintiffs. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) advisory \ncommittee’s note to the 1966 amendment (“Illustrative are various actions in the \ncivil-rights field where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a \nclass, usually one whose members are incapable of specific enumeration.”). The \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure enshrined the common-law meaning of “class” \nwhen it defined a “class” of injured persons according to “common questions of \nlaw or fact.” 5 Moore’s Federal Practice - Civil § 23App.100 (2021) (discussing \n11 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 20 of 42\n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23). In other words, “class,” as a term of art, referenced persons \nsimilarly injured in a particular case by a particular law or policy.  \nCongress was responding in 1982 to other Fourteenth- and Fifteenth-\nAmendment cases involving race- or color-based discrimination in which the \n“class” was defined by the facts on the ground—an inquiry that was “intensely \nlocal.” See White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 769 (1973) (recognizing classes \ndefined by facts unique to the particular geographic areas). The Supreme Court \naffirmed in Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 478-79 (1954), that the existence of \na “separate class” was a community-specific “question of fact”. The attitudes of the \ncommunity—whether the putative class was considered separate and distinct—was \nsufficient proof. Id. at 479. The Court in White v. Regester cited Hernandez, noting \nthat, “[c]onsistently with Hernandez v. Texas, the District Court considered \nMexican-Americans in Bexar County to be an identifiable class for Fourteenth \nAmendment purposes.” 412 U.S. at 767. Notably, depending on the facts, the \ncourts would frequently circumscribe a “class” at varying levels of generality. In \nHernandez, the class was limited to Mexican Americans, while in other cases, it \ncould be Hispanos or Hispanics, a term that defines a group as broad as “person[s] \nof Spanish, Mexican, or Cuban heritage.” See Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. \n189, 195 n.6 (1973). In Keyes, a Fourteenth-Amendment suit challenging \nsegregation in Denver’s school system, the Court held that Black and Hispanic \n12 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 21 of 42\n \nstudents were part of the same class, despite being “of different origins.” 413 U.S. \nat 198. The important factor was their common injury—they had “suffer[ed] \nidentical discrimination in treatment when compare[d] with the treatment afforded \nAnglo students.” Id. See also United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. \nv. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 150 n.5 (1977) (classifying Puerto Rican and Black \ncitizens as a minority group and using the term “nonwhite” to refer to them \ncollectively). \nCongress considered both White and Keyes when crafting the 1982 \namendments. See S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 2, 132-33, 178 (1982). Indeed, it was \nWhite on which Congress based the results-based test codified in Section 2. See id. \nat 2 (1982). Congress used the word “class” in subsection (b) in the same way that \nthe White Court had—in its common-law sense, to indicate a group of citizens \ncommonly injured by the same race-, color-, or language-based discrimination, \nhowever that discrimination happens to manifest in a particular geographic \nlocation. As the Court noted in 1954, “community prejudices are not static, and \nfrom time to time other differences from the community norm may define other \ngroups which need the same protection.” Hernandez, 347 U.S. at 478. It was \nagainst this fulsome backdrop that Congress wrote Section 2(b). \n \n \n13 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 22 of 42\n \nB.  Such an interpretation is consistent with the VRA’s purpose. \nAs the Supreme Court observed in Gingles, Section 2 primarily concerns the \ninteraction between electoral laws, practices, and structures with social and \nhistorical conditions that operate to create inequality in opportunities to elect \npreferred representatives on the basis of race, color, or language minority status. \n478 U.S. at 47. The Court specifically noted the propensity of multimember \ndistricts and at-large systems to “minimize or cancel out the voting strength of \nracial [minorities in] the voting population” in the presence of certain case-specific \nfactors. Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This minimizing or \ncancelling is no less present when the submergence impacts a Black minority, like \nin Gingles, or, as here, where minority voters encompass multiple identities. In \nother words, the purpose of Section 2 (and its text) would be frustrated by limiting \n“class” to a single racial group as a matter of law rather than leaving its definition \nas a case-specific factual inquiry. Cf. Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 403-04 \n(1991) (reaffirming that the VRA “should be interpreted in a manner that provides \n‘the broadest possible scope’ in combatting racial discrimination”).  \nThe propriety of this approach is further supported by the absurd result that \ncould flow from the application of the textually untethered view advanced by the \nCity. See Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 575 (1982) \n(“[I]nterpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are to be \n14 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 23 of 42\n \navoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are \navailable.”); United States v. Young, 989 F.3d 253, 260 (4th Cir. 2021). Consider a \nhypothetical pair of counties where minority voters experience dilution: \nCounty A  County B \n•  At-large system dilutes the votes  •  At-large system dilutes the votes \nof citizens of color  of citizens of color \n•  Citizens of color are  •  Citizens of color are \ngeographically compact,  geographically compact, \npolitically cohesive and there is  politically cohesive and there is \npersistent racially polarized  persistent racially polarized \nvoting  voting \n•  Voting-age citizens of color  •  Voting-age citizens of color \ncould compose 60% of a  could compose 60% of a \nhypothetical single-member  hypothetical single-member \ndistrict   district  \n•  Voting-age citizens of color are  •  Voting age citizens of color are \n90% Black and 10% Latino  50% Black and 50% Latino \n \nResult: Actionable  Result: Exempt \n \nIn County A, citizens of color are as politically cohesive and geographically \ncompact as citizens of color in County B. The continued use of an at-large election \nsystem affects citizens of color in each county equally. Citizens of color represent \nthe same share of the voting-eligible population. The only difference is that County \nB’s population includes a greater share of Latino citizens. Under the City’s \nreading, this difference would immunize County B’s policy from suit under \nSection 2, leading to results plainly inconsistent with the purpose and text of \nSection 2.  \n15 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 24 of 42\n \nII.  Section 2 claims by minority coalitions are consistent with Congress’s \nintent in passing the VRA. \nCongress enacted the VRA “in part as a prophylactic safeguard against racial \ndiscrimination” and expected it to be “forward-looking and constructive in nature.” \nVoting Rights Act: Hearing on S.53, S.1761, S.1975, S.1992, and H.R. 3112 Before \nthe Subcomm. on the Constitution, 97th Cong. 68-69 (1982). In its repeated \nreauthorizations of the VRA and expansions of Section 2, Congress was aware of \nminority coalition claims in the courts and as enforced by the Department of \nJustice (“DOJ”), and spoke of different racial and language minorities in tandem. It \nrecognized that their experiences of discrimination often ran in parallel. An \ninterpretation of Section 2 that denies minority coalitions access to the VRA’s \nbroad remedial protection would be “wholly inconsistent with the plain language \nof the Act and the express purpose which Congress sought to attain in amending \nSection 2; that is, to expand the protection of the Act.” Chisom, 501 U.S. at 404 n.8 \n(quoting Chisom v. Edwards, 839 F.2d 1059, 1061 (1988)).  \nA.  Congress intended for Section 2 to broadly apply to minority \ncoalitions.  \nCongress was aware of precedent and practice authorizing minority coalition \nclaims when it codified and reauthorized the expansive standards in Section 2. \nCongress declined to foreclose such claims and instead implicitly ratified what it \nunderstood was existing law and practice at the time—similarly aggrieved \n16 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 25 of 42\n \nminorities bringing claims as a single class. See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1747 \n(“failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls within a more general \nstatutory rule does not create a tacit exception”).  \nIn fact, in drafting the 1982 amendment, Congress directly referenced at \nleast one Supreme Court case in which a minority coalition challenged the validity \nof an election law on grounds of racial discrimination. See S. Rep. No. 417, 97th \nCong., 2nd Sess. (1982) (citing Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52 (1964)). In \nWright, Black and Hispanic voters claimed that a New York apportionment statute \nviolated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and argued that the districting \nscheme was “contrived to create one district…which excludes non-white citizens \nand citizens of Puerto Rican origin,” while concentrating members of the same in \nthree other districts.3 376 U.S. at 52-54 (1964) (in considering a minority \ncoalition’s challenge, the Court found plaintiffs failed to prove New York \ndistricting law was motivated by racial considerations or drawn along racial lines).   \nEven prior to the 1975 expansion of the VRA, the Supreme Court and \nvarious other federal courts ruled on cases in which minorities aggregated their \nclaims. In White v. Regester, for example, the Supreme Court evaluated in 1973 \n                                                 \n3 Although Wright was originally decided in 1964, a year before passage of the \nVRA, and was brought under 14th and 15th Amendments, Congress’s reliance on \nWright in its expansions of the VRA is evidence of Congressional awareness of \nminority coalition claims in the area of voting discrimination. \n17 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 26 of 42\n \nwhether a multi-member election scheme for the election of state legislators \nimpermissibly and unconstitutionally denied the Mexican-American and Black \nright to vote in each of their geographic locations respectively. Although White v. \nRegester is a consolidation of actions filed in four District Courts, the Supreme \nCourt evaluated all of the voters’ rights collectively. Similarly, the Second Circuit \nin Coalition for Education in District One v. Board of Education, a challenge by a \nminority coalition of Black, Hispanic, and Chinese Lower East Side residents, \nupheld a District Court’s finding that certain school board procedures were invalid \nunder the VRA because they had a disparate impact on these voters. 495 F.2d \n1090, 1093 (2d Cir. 1974). \nCongress, in reauthorizing the VRA in 2006, stated the purpose of the VRA \n“is to ensure the right of all citizens to vote” and noted in its findings that “racial \nand language minorities continue to remain politically vulnerable.” Pub. L. No. \n109-246, §2, July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 577. Congress also cited filings of Section 2 \ncases as well as enforcement actions by the DOJ. At the time of that \nreauthorization, two Circuit Courts had previously explicitly determined that the \nterm class could apply to minority voters of different racial or ethnic identity. In \nLULAC I, the Fifth Circuit ruled that Black and Hispanic voters could aggregate to \nbring a Section 2 claim. LULAC v. Midland Indep. Sch. Dist., 812 F.2d 1494, \n1499-1502 (5th Cir. 1987). The Fifth Circuit upheld this finding several times prior \n18 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 27 of 42\n \nto the reauthorization of the VRA: once in 1988, twice in 1989, and again in 1993. \nSee generally LULAC v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831 (5th Cir. 1993); Brewer v. Ham, \n876 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1989); Overton v. City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529 (5th Cir. \n1989); Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir. 1988). Similarly, the \nEleventh Circuit in Concerned Citizens of Hardee County v. Hardee County Board \nof Commissioners held that two minority groups could aggregate so long as they \nwere politically cohesive. 906 F.2d 524, 526 (11th Cir. 1990). Before the Sixth \nCircuit ruled in 1996 that minority coalition claims could not be brought under \nSection 2, all courts addressing minority coalition claims under Section 2 properly \ndeemed them to be permissible. Nixon v. Kent County, 76 F.3d 1381, 1393 (1996) \n(Keith J., dissenting). In fact, Nixon notwithstanding, many courts continue to rule \nthat minority coalition claims brought under Section 2 are proper. See, e.g., Pope v. \nCounty of Albany, 687 F.3d 565 (2d Cir. 2012). \nDespite Congress’s explicit awareness of minority coalition claims in the \ncourts, Congress never took any steps to redefine “class.” See, e.g., Nixon, 76 F.3d \nat 1398.  Indeed, even critics of the proposed amendments raised no concerns \nabout such claims. Voting Rights Act: Hearing on S.53, S.1761, S.1975, S.1992, \nand H.R. 3112 Before the Subcomm. on the Constitution, 97th Cong. 524 (1982); \nsee also S. Rep. No. 417 at 108-239 (Report of the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution). Based on this evidence, Congress chose to expand rather than \n19 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 28 of 42\n \nrestrict the scope and reach of the VRA and recognized both implicitly and \nexplicitly that experiences of discrimination can cut across multiple identities.  \nWhen Congress expanded the VRA to cover discrimination not only on the \nbasis of “race or color” but also on account of membership in a “language minority \ngroup,”4 Pub. L. No. 94-73, 89 Stat. 400, this intent and understanding shone \nthrough clearly. In its 1975 report, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not focus \nsolely on racial or language identity, but instead detailed the experiences that \ncreated the “class” that the VRA was trying to protect— a wide range of \nexperiences of discrimination shared by racial and language minorities, including \n“invidious discrimination and treatment in the fields of education, employment, \neconomics, health, politics and others,” S. Rep. No. 94-295 at 30,  and the \n“economic dependence of these minorities upon the Anglo power structure.” Id. at \n28.  Recognizing that experiences of discrimination are often shared by members \nof different minority groups, the Committee noted that Texas, which “has a \nsubstantial minority population…comprised primarily of Mexican Americans and \nblacks,” also has “a long history of discriminating against members of both \nminority groups.” Id. at 25; see also LULAC, 812 F.2d at 1496, vacated and aff’d \n                                                 \n4 Language minorities protected by the VRA are those “racial minorities whose \nprimary language is other than English,” such as Hispanic-Americans, Asian-\nAmericans, American Indians, and Alaska natives. S. Rep. No. 295, 94th Cong., \n1st Sess. 8 (1975).   \n \n20 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 29 of 42\n \non other grounds, 829 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1987) (finding that Black and Hispanic \nvoters in Midland, Texas were both victim to “oppressive discrimination that has \nhad lingering effects on the election system,” in turn impacting “the rights of \nHispanics and Blacks to register, to vote, and to otherwise participate in the \nelection process”). That shared experience of multiple minority groups is critical to \nunderstanding the “class” that Congress passed the VRA to protect.   \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee also emphasized that the purpose of the \nSection 2 framework is to require a “searching practical evaluation of the ‘past and \npresent reality.” S. Rep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, 30 (1982). The ultimate \nquestion, according to Congress, is “whether, in the particular situation, the \npractice operated to deny the minority plaintiff an equal opportunity to participate \nand to elect candidates of their choice.” Id. Such an inquiry, designed to respond to \nthe evolving context of voter discrimination, compels an interpretation of Section 2 \nthat preserves rather than curtails the intended breadth and flexibility encouraged \nby the “totality of the circumstances” inquiry. Accordingly, if the reality of voter \ndiscrimination involves mechanisms targeting or impacting multiple minority \ngroups, then denying that class of voters access to Section 2 relief simply because \nthey are too powerless as a singular minority would be incompatible with the \nexpress purpose of the Act and the standards mandated by Congress. \n21 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 30 of 42\n \nB.      Congress was aware of and accepted the VRA’s application to \nmultiracial classes when it reauthorized and amended the Act in \n1975 and 1982. \nThe record of DOJ enforcement of Section 5 on behalf of multiracial \ncoalitions and judicial approval of such DOJ action informed Congress when it \namended and re-enacted the VRA in 1982 and maintained parallel language \nbetween Section 5 and Section 2 to define the protected population. Compare 52 \nU.S.C. 10301 § 2(a) (“No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, \npractice, or procedure shall be imposed … in a manner which results in a denial or \nabridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of \nrace or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section \n10303(f)(2)”) with 52 U.S.C. § 10304 (“Any voting qualification or prerequisite to \nvoting, or standard, practice, or procedure… that has the purpose of or will have \nthe effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account \nof race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section \n10303(f)(2)”). As drafted, both provisions concern citizens who suffer violations \non account of race, color, or membership in a language minority. Whether \nCongress intended Section 5 to be invoked by multiracial coalitions thus implicates \nwhether it intended Section 2 to be as well. See Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v. \nUnited States ex rel. Hunt, 139 S. Ct. 1507, 1512 (2019) (establishing that “[i]n all \n22 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 31 of 42\n \nbut the most unusual situations, a single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed \nmeaning.”).  \nThe history of Section 5 enforcement provides further evidence that \nCongress intended to create a VRA capable of reaching discrimination suffered by \nmultiple minority groups. It is axiomatic that “‘Congress is presumed to be aware \nof an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that \ninterpretation when it re-enacts [that] statute without change.’” Forest Grove Sch. \nDist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239-40 (2009) (quoting Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. \n575, 581 (1978)). That is precisely what happened with the VRA: Congress \nadopted a consistent administrative and judicial application of the VRA to \nmultiracial coalitions when it amended Section 2. \nPrior to 1982, the DOJ regularly enforced Section 5 on behalf of multiple \nracial groups. For instance, in a 1974 letter objecting to a district plan submitted by \nKings County, New York, the DOJ premised its denial of preclearance on the \ngrounds that the districts “unnecessarily dilut[ed] the voting strength of black and \nPuerto Rican residents.” See Letter from J. Stanley Pottinger, Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, to George D. Zuckerman, Apr. 1, 1974. In 1975, the DOJ warned of \npossible “submergence” of the voting strength “of significant concentrations of \nBlack, Puerto Rican and Chinese people.” Letter from J. Stanley Pottinger, \nAssistant Attorney General, to Stanley E. Michels, Sept. 3, 1975. Finally, in 1976, \n23 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 32 of 42\n \nDOJ objected because the “dilutive” system imposed a possible “discriminatory \neffect on blacks and Mexican-Americans” concentrated in a single geographic \narea. Letter from J. Stanley Pottinger, Assistant Attorney General, to L. Holt \nMagee, Mar. 11, 1976. Other examples similarly apply Section 5 on behalf of \nmultiple, explicitly named racial minorities. See Brennan Center for Justice, \nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/ \nHolloway_Appendix_DOJ_Enforcement_Letters.pdf (compiling twenty DOJ \nletters between 1974 and 1982 enforcing Section 5 on behalf of a multi-racial \nclass). \nFurthermore, the Supreme Court took no issue with such application of \nSection 5. In the case arising out of the 1974 enforcement action against Kings \nCounty, the DOJ’s practice of aggregating Black and Puerto Rican voters into a \nsingle minority group was uncontroversial and the Supreme Court recognized their \nrights in aggregate as a cognizable “nonwhite” population. Carey, 430 U.S. at 150 \nn.5 (“The NAACP, the Attorney General, and the court below classified Puerto \nRicans in New York together with blacks as a minority group entitled to the \nprotections of the Voting Rights Act. Hereinafter we use the term ‘nonwhite’ to \nrefer to blacks and Puerto Ricans . . . .”). This acknowledgement to the multiracial \nreach of Section 5 is particularly salient because the Carey decision was cited at \nlength in hearings leading to the 1982 amendment and reauthorization of the VRA. \n24 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 33 of 42\n \nSee Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Civil & Constitutional Rights of the H. \nComm. on the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3 at 2119-20 (1981); Hearings \nBefore the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 97th \nCong., 2nd Sess., pts. 1-2 (1982) (citing Carey 51 times); S. Rep. No. 97-417, at \n121 (1982).  \nHad Congress “disagreed” with the multiracial reach of the VRA, it would \nhave altered the language to sever the parallelism with Section 5. Dougherty Cty. v. \nWhite, 439 U.S. 32, 38 (1978) (continuing to interpret Section 5 broadly because \nCongress did not “clarif[y] its intent” during reenactment). When Congress instead \nretained these “parallel definitions,” it “intended to ratify” the interpretation \nreached by the DOJ. Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998) (discussing \nCongress’s active endorsement of existing interpretations of “disability” under the \nRehabilitation Act in its enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act).  \nIII.  The fact-intensive nature of the Section 2 framework makes it more \nthan capable of resolving claims raised by minority coalitions.  \nCongress and the courts have established a robust and fact-intensive \nframework for evaluating Section 2 claims, which can resolve claims of vote \ndilution brought by minority coalitions. In particular, both (i) the “totality of \ncircumstances” framework required under Section 2 and (ii) the three-part test for \nestablishing racially polarized voting under Gingles easily identify meritorious \n25 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 34 of 42\n \nSection 2 claims brought by minority coalitions but can reject claims that fail to \nmeet the requirements. \nIn Gingles, the Court set forth a framework for evaluating vote dilution \nclaims under Section 2, including a non-exhaustive list of factors established by the \n1982 Senate Report to be considered in the “totality of circumstances” for Section \n2 claims (the “Senate Factors”). See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44-45, 48-51. The Court \nalso identified three preconditions (the “Gingles preconditions”) for demonstrating \nracially polarized voting—one of the hallmark Senate Factors for vote dilution \nclaims. Under Gingles, plaintiffs making vote dilution claims must demonstrate \nthat (i) the minority population in question “is sufficiently large and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”; (ii) the minority \npopulation is “politically cohesive”; and (iii) the non-minority population “votes \nsufficiently as a bloc . . . to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” Id. at 50-51. \nPlaintiffs must first demonstrate that their claim satisfies these Gingles \npreconditions, and “[i]f those preconditions are met, the court must then determine \nunder the ‘totality of circumstances’ whether there has been a violation of Section \n2.”  Levy v. Lexington Cty., 589 F.3d 708, 713 (4th Cir. 2009). \n26 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 35 of 42\n \nImportantly, not all coalition claims will meet the Gingles preconditions \nsufficient for a Section 2 claim. For example, if the aggregate5 of voters of three \ndifferent races does not comprise a majority of the voting-age population in any \nsingle hypothetical single-member district, then its coalition claim would likely fail \nthe first Gingles precondition. Yet even coalition claims that do satisfy that \nnumerosity precondition must still demonstrate that its members are politically \ncohesive and face persistent racial-bloc voting by white voters. For example, the \nSecond Circuit affirmed a district court finding that Black and Latino coalition \nclaimants satisfied the second Gingles precondition; claimants presented expert \nevidence relying on ecological inference models demonstrating minority voting \ncohesion for losing candidates and anecdotal evidence in support thereof.  NAACP, \nSpring Valley Branch v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 462 F. Supp. 3d 368, 387 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020), aff'd sub nom. Clerveaux v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 984 F.3d \n213, 225-26, 232-33 (2d Cir. 2021). In contrast, the Fifth Circuit upheld a district \ncourt ruling that coalitional Black and Mexican-American claimants did not \ndemonstrate political cohesion, because (i) anecdotal evidence of cohesiveness was \n                                                 \n5 The Court’s rejection of “crossover” claims in Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1 \n(2009), has no bearing on coalition claims.  The minority group in Bartlett \ndepended on white voters—who are not protected under the VRA—in its failed \nattempt to meet the first Gingles precondition concerning numerosity. Bartlett, 556 \nU.S. at 14-15. Not so with minority coalitions, where each claimant is a member of \na protected group aggregated with others to meet the first Gingles precondition. \n27 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 36 of 42\n \nnot supported “by survey or other demonstrative evidence”; (ii) “Anglos voted \nwith [each] minority group more frequently than the two groups voted together”; \nand (iii) prior electoral results demonstrated that each group preferred different \ncandidates. Overton, 871 F.2d at 536. \nIn any case, the Gingles preconditions provide a fact-intensive framework \nallowing courts to make a probing inquiry into the political context unique to each \ncase. That framework is sufficiently narrow to allow courts to reject6 inappropriate \nclaims, yet broad enough to recognize valid coalition claims. The same is true of \nthe “totality of circumstances” assessment. This inquiry embeds a fact-intensive, \nyet flexible, standard for courts to assess Section 2 claims. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at \n46. The Fourth Circuit has also credited the flexibility of the standard, finding “it is \nthis inclusive examination of the totality of the circumstances that is tailor-made \nfor considering why voting patterns differ along racial lines.” United States v. \nCharleston Cty., 365 F.3d 341, 348 (4th Cir. 2004). There is no logical reason for \nthe judiciary to impose a categorical restriction of coalition claims when Congress \nhas provided for a more thoughtful approach. \n                                                 \n6 The claimants in Bartlett also failed the third Gingles precondition that the \nmajority votes as a bloc to defeat minority-preferred candidates, as the existence of \ncrossover white voters dispelled any notion of majority cohesiveness. See Bartlett, \n556 U.S. at 16. Unlike the Bartlett claimants, minority coalition claimants can \ndemonstrate that a cohesive white voting bloc is able to thwart a population, \ncomprised of multiple minority groups from protected classes, from electing its \ncandidate of choice.  \n28 \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 21-1533      Doc: 86            Filed: 02/28/2022      Pg: 37 of 42\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe VRA, including Section 2, seeks to provide full, fair, and equal access \nto the ballot. Ultimately, while Section 2 does not explicitly identify minority \ncoalition claims, numerous factors make clear that minority coalition claims are an \nessential part of Section 2. To disallow such claims would be to contravene the \nintention of Congress in both recognizing persistent voter dilution as it affects \nmultiple minority groups and drafting Section 2 broadly enough to encompass \nenforcement against such dilution in fulfillment of the VRA’s worthy objectives. \nRespectfully submitted this the 28th day of February, 2022. \n \n/s/ Nathaniel B.
