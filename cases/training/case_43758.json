      "title": "The City of Peoria Motion to Modify the Amended Final Consent Decree Dated August 10, 1988",
      "text": "E-FILED\n Monday, 01 August, 2016  01:24:57 PM \n \n Clerk, U.S. District Court, ILCD\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, URBANA DIVISION \n \nJOYCE BANKS, et. al.       ) \n            ) \n    Plaintiffs,      ) \n            ) \nvs.            )    No. 87-2371 \n            ) \nCITY OF PEORIA, et.al.      ) \n            ) \n    Defendants      ) \n \nTHE CITY OF PEORIA MOTION TO MODIFY  \nTHE AMENDED FINAL CONSENT DECREE DATED AUGUST 10, 1988. \n \n  The City of Peoria, by and through its Corporation Counsel and its attorneys, \nKavanagh, Scully, Sudow, White and Frederick, P.C. seeks to modify and further amend the \nAmended Final Consent Decree and Full Resolution of Action dated August 10, 1988 and in \nsupport thereof files this Motion and accompanying Memorandum.  \nJURISDICTION \n \n1.  The City of Peoria requests this Honorable Court to modify and amend the Amended \nFinal Consent Decree and Full Resolution of Action entered August 10, 1988 as applied to a \nspecial election, held pursuant to Illinois Law, for the election of at-large members of the \nPeoria City Council.     \n2.  The original Consent Decree was entered on November 23, 1987; however, on letter \nmotion by the Peoria Board of Election Commissioners, the decree was amended.  The \nAmended Final Consent Decree and Full Resolution of Action was entered by this Court on \nAugust 10, 1988.   \n3.  The Amended Final Consent Decree provides that “This Court retains jurisdiction of \nthis case for purposes of supervising the implementation of this Consent Decree.”  See \n1 \n \n\n \nparagraph 5, Amended Final Consent Decree and Full Resolution of Action entered August 10, \n1988 and attached as Exhibit 1 to City of Peoria Memorandum in Support to Modify. \nPROCEDURE \n4.  In addition to this Court explicitly retaining jurisdiction of this case and, further, the \nCourt  entering  a  previous  amendment  to  the  Consent  Decree,  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 60(b) provides that modification and amendment is permitted for the relief \nfrom a “final judgment, order, or proceeding.”  It permits the Court, on a motion, to relieve a \nparty or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding by, in part, \namending and modifying the order.  In relevant part the rule states in (b)(5) and b(6),  that \nrelief is warranted if “the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based \non an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no \nlonger  equitable;  or;  (6)  any  other  reason  that  justifies  relief”  then  amendment  and \nmodification is appropriate.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \n5.   This  rule  serves  a  “particularly  important  function”  in  reviewing  “institutional \nreform litigation.” Horn v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 447 (2009).  The Supreme Court states that \nConsent Judgments should not take on “a talismanic quality warding off virtually all efforts \nto modify consent decrees.” Rufo v. Inmates, et. al. 502 U.S. 367, 380 (1992).   The Supreme \nCourt has recognized that consent decrees may remain in place for many years, and that \nthe passage of time brings about changed circumstances which call for reexamination of \nthe original consent. Horn 557 U.S. at 448. The party seeking relief must meet the burden of \nshowing that changed circumstances warrant relief. Horn at 447. \n2 \n \n\n \n6.  As detailed in the attached Memorandum, an issue has arisen that is not addressed \nin the Amended Consent Decree – specifically, the means of electing an at-large City Council \nseat in a special election and under what circumstances that a primary is held to reduce the \ncandidate field.  \n7.  The proposed remedy, as set forth in the attached Memorandum, codifies what may \nbe implied in the Amended Consent Decree but is not stated and the changed circumstance \nwarrants relief. The proposed remedy is narrowed tailored to the circumstances at hand. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the City of Peoria requests, for the reasons stated in this Motion and \nthe Memorandum, to modify the Amended Consent Decree to state that if under Illinois law \na special election is held to fill a vacancy for an at-large seat, then each voter in that election \nmay cast the same number of votes as seats are available in that special at-large election.  \nFurther, a primary will be held to reduce the candidate field down to twice the number of \nseats that are available in that special at-large election.  \n(signature on next page) \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\n \n            Respectfully Submitted by the        \n            City of Peoria, Defendant.         \n   \n            BY:  S/ _Robert C.

That said Amended Final Consent Decree provided that the 5 at- \nlarge City Council seats shall be elected by means of cumulative voting such that \neach voter may vote for one, two, three, four or five candidates at such election. \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 27    Page 2 of 4 \nAmended Exhibit B to the said Consent Decree specifically stated in part as \nfollows with regard to such cumulative voting: \n\"If a voter votes for just one candidate, that candidate shall receive five \nvotes. If a voter votes for just two candidates, each of those candidates \nshall receive 2% votes. If a voter votes for just three candidates, each of \nthose  candidates shall  receive  1 213  votes.  If  a  voter  votes  for  four \ncandidates, each of those candidates shall receive 1% votes. If a voter \nvotes for five candidates, each of those candidates shall receive 1 vote. \nThe  maximum  number  of  votes  each  voter  may  cast  in the  at-large \nelections will be five. The five candidates who receive the highest number \nof votes in the general election will be declared the winners of the at-large \nseats.\" \n3.  That on December 21, 2005, the Peoria Election Commission \nentered into an agreement with Hart Intercivic, Inc. for the purchase of Hart's \ne Slate Electronic Voting System (hereinafter referred to as the e Slate Voting \nSystem) for the purpose of conducting elections within the City of Peoria, \nincluding, but not limited to, elections for the 5 at-large City Council seats \nreferred to in paragraph 1 above. \n4.  That the e Slate Voting System is a Direct Recording Electronic \nVoting System as that term is defined in Section 24 C-2 of the Illinois Election \nCode (10 ILCS 5124C-2), which system provides for the casting and counting of \nvotes by the use of electronic equipment. \n5.  That Section 24 C-12 of the Illinois Election Code (10 ILCS 5124C- \n12) provides, in part, that the voter shall cast his ballot on the Direct Recording \nElectronic Voting System at the polling place and that the counting and tallying of \nthe votes cast on the Direct Recording Electronic Voting System shall be \nperformed by such voting system at the polling location where such equipment is \nlocated, after the close of the polls on election day. Said Section 24C-12 further \nprovides that the totals of votes cast for all candidates and propositions, after \n2 \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 27    Page 3 of 4 \nbeing tabulated by such equipment, shall be printed out by the automatic \ntabulating equipment and one copy of such vote totals print out shall be posted in \na conspicuous place inside the polling place. Said Section 24C-12 further states \nthat \"every effort shall be made by the judges of election to provide a copy for \neach authorized poll watcher or other official authorized to be present in the \npolling place to observe the counting of the ballots; but in no case shall the \nnumber of copies to be made available to poll watchers be fewer than four, \nchosen by lot by the judges of election. In addition, sufficient time shall be \nprovided by the judges of election to the poll watchers to allow them to copy \ninformation from the copy which has been posted.\" (a copy of Section 24C-12 is \nattached hereto for reference) \n6.  That Hart Intercivic, Inc. has determined that a significant \nredevelopment effort would be required to re-engineer the tabulation routines \nwithin the e Slate Voting System firmware to accommodate the counting of \nPeoria's fractional cumulative voting (FCV) at the precinct level. Hart is also \nconcerned that because the results of a write-in adjudication are not entered into \nthe system at the precinct, the FCV results produced at the precinct would be \nincorrect. \n7.  That Hart Intercivic, Inc. has determined that its voting system \nequipment can be programmed to accurately count and tally fractional cumulative \nvotes cast at Peoria's at-large City Council elections by counting and tabulating \nthose votes at a central location, as opposed to counting and tabulating those \nvotes at the precinct polling places. For this reason, the Peoria Election \nCommission moves this court for the entry of an Order to amend the Amended \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 27    Page 4 of 4 \nFinal Consent Decree in this case by adding to said Consent Decree a provision \nwhich would authorize the Peoria Election Commission to count and tally all \nvotes cast in elections for at-large City Council seats at said Commission's \ncentral office location at 542 S.W. Adams Street, Peoria, Illinois or at such other \ncentral location where said Election Commission may have its office in the future. \n8.  That the amendment proposed by this Motion will in no way change \nthe method of electing at-large Peoria City Council members by cumulative \nvoting as set forth in this Court's Amended Final Consent Decree which was \nentered in this case on August 10, 1988. \nWherefore, Defendant, Peoria Election Commission, respectfully moves \nthat this court enter an Order amending the Amended Final Consent Decree And \nFull Resolution Of Action previously entered in this case by providing that votes \ncast in elections for at-large Peoria City Council seats in the General and Primary \nElections for those seats may be counted and tallied at the office of the Peoria \nElection Commissioner in Peoria, Illinois. \nBoard of Election Commissioners of the \nCity of Peoria, \nDefendant \nBy: \nobert G.

Craven, P.C., and for their\nresponse to the Petition of the Peoria Election Commission state as follows:\nThe Peoria Election Commission has asked this court to allow the Commission to avoid a\nprovision of the Illinois Election Code which requires that ballots be counted at the polling\nplace, and the results posted at the polling place.  The Election Commission asks that it be\nallowed to count those ballots at a central location.\nThe Orders previously entered in this cas, provide that elections in the city of Peoria will\ncomply with all provisions of Illinois state law. (Paragraph 5, Amended Electoral Structure for\nthe City Council, attached to Commission Petition.)  The Commission correctly states the\nprinciples of state law.  Section 24C-12 of the Election Code requires the tabulation of ballots at\nthe precinct level.\nApparently, the system provided by the Commission’s vendor can not meet the\nrequirements of the statute.  The Commission entered into a contract for the purchase of an\nelectronic voting system on December 21, 2005.  The most recent amendments to Section 24C-\n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 31    Filed: 06/05/06    Page 2 of 5 \n12 went into effect on August 22, 2005.  The requirement for precinct level tabulation is not new\nto Section 24C-12; that requirement was in place when the vendor formulated its bid and the\nCommission agreed to purchase the equipment.\nThe Commission does not state that the Hart system can not be modified, and it does not\nstate whether that modification would be done at the expense of Hart or at the expense of the\nCommission.\nThe Commission does not state that there is no other electronic voting system which can\naccommodate the Peoria electoral structure.\nThose objections aside, this court is without authority to vary the provisions of state law,\nabsent a finding that state law violates the Voting Rights Act, or some other provision of federal\nlaw.   The Supreme Court has held that in fashioning an electoral system to remedy a voting\nrights violation, courts “should follow the policies and preferences of the State, as expressed in\nstatutory and constitutional provisions or in the ··· plans proposed by the state legislature,\nwhenever adherence to state policy does not detract from the Federal  Constitution.” White v.\nWeiser, 412 U.S. 783, 795, 93 S.Ct. 2348, 37 L.Ed.2d 335 (1973). \nPlaintiffs would point this Court to the multiple District Court and Seventh Circuit\ndecisions in the Chicago Heights voting rights litigation, which remains pending some 19 years\nafter it was initiated.  There have been several attempts to resolve that litigation, and each\nattempt has in some way required a deviation from state law.  The Seventh Circuit has rejected\neach such attempt.  Perkins v. City of Chicago Heights 47 F.3d 212,  (C.A.7 (Ill.),1995), \nHarper v. City of Chicago Heights 223 F.3d 593 (2000),  (C.A.7 (Ill.),2000).\nIn the firt trip to the Seventh Circuit, the court rejected a plan which varied from state\nlaw.  The court stated, “remedies that override state law must be narrowly tailored so as to\n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 31    Filed: 06/05/06    Page 3 of 5 \ninfringe state sovereignty as minimally as possible. Jenkins, 495 U.S. at 57-58, 110 S.Ct. at\n1666-67. Federal remedial powers can \"be exercised only on the basis of a violation of the law\nand [can] extend no farther than required by the nature and extent of the violation.\" General\nBldg. Contractors v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 399, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3154, 73 L.Ed.2d 835\n(1982). \nPerkins v. City of Chicago Heights 47 F.3d 212, *217 (C.A.7 (Ill.),1995).\nFive years later, the Court rejected yet another plan, that varied from state law in a\ndifferent fashion.  The Court held, “the court, in exercising its discretion to fashion a remedy that\ncomplies with § 2, must to the greatest extent possible give effect to the legislative policy\njudgments underlying the current electoral scheme or the legally unacceptable remedy offered by\nthe legislative body.” Cane v. Worcester County, Md., 35 F.3d 921, 928 (4th Cir.1994).\nHarper v. City of Chicago Heights 223 F.3d 593 (2000), *601 -602 (C.A.7 (Ill.),2000).\nThe Commission would have this Court enter an order establishing a strucure for\nelections which varies from state law.  The Illinois General Assembly adopted as the election\npolicy of this state that in the event an election commission chooses to use an electronic voting\nsystem, the results will be tabulated at the precinct level.  That law, evoking that policy, was\ninplace when the Commission purchased this equipment.  No argument is made that the\nprovisions of Section 24C-12 violate federal law in any way.  \nAbsent a finding that the provisions of section 24C-12 violate federal law, or that\ncompliance with section 24C-12 is impossible, this court is without authority to enter an order in\nderogation of the policies adopted by the state of Illinois, and the Petition to Amend should be\ndenied.\n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 31    Filed: 06/05/06    Page 4 of 5 \nRespectfully Submitted,\nDated : June 5, 2006 s/ Donald M.

Defendant\nPeoria Election Commission (“PEC”) was “authorized and ordered to comply with the terms of\nthe Consent Decree and to conduct elections in accordance with the Consent Decree.”  The\nAmended Electoral Structure of the City Council, made part of the Consent Decree as Exhibit B,\nmandates the use of “fractional cumulative voting” for the election of Peoria City Council at-\nlarge seats.  It further specifies, “The elections in all other respects will be governed by the law\nof the State of Illinois.”\nPEC filed a motion to amend the Amended Final Consent Decree [#27], and a motion to\ntransfer this case to the United States District Court, Central District of Illinois, Peoria Division\n[#28].  PEC argues that the motion to amend does not deal with the substantive issues that were\ninvolved with this case when it was decided, and that all potential witnesses reside or work in\nPeoria, so it would be more convenient for them to appear in court in Peoria.  The court finds\nneither argument persuasive.  There is no indication that testimony is needed to rule on the\nmotion to amend, and an amendment of the Consent Decree can hardly be considered non-\nsubstantive.  The motion to transfer [#28] is denied.\nThe essence of the motion to amend is to obtain this court’s permission to disregard state\nelection law by finding it in conflict with federal law.  PEC states that on December 21, 2005, it\nentered into an agreement with Hart Intercivic, Inc., for the purchase of Hart’s e Slate Electronic\nVoting System (“the System”), which allows voters to cast – and election officials to count –\nvotes by electronic means. The System is a Direct Recording Electronic Voting System as\ndefined in 10 Ill. Comp Stat. 5/24C-2.   \nOn August 23, 2003, the Illinois legislature amended the Election Code to regulate voting\nby electronic means.  Votes cast using a Direct Recording Electronic Voting System must be\ntabulated at the polling place, and a “Certificate of Results” must be printed and posted at the\n1\n\npolling place and given to poll watchers.  The tabulated precinct results may be transmitted to a\ncentral location by electronic means, but electronic transmission is not mandated by the statute.\n10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24C-12.\nPEC states that its newly-purchased System would need to be significantly re-engineered\nto accommodate the accurate counting of fractional cumulative voting at the polling place.  PEC\nasserts that the fractional cumulative votes can be easily and accurately counted and tallied at the\ncentral location.  Therefore, PEC seeks an amendment to the Consent Decree stating that PEC is\nauthorized to count and tally fractional cumulative votes at its central office location.  In other\nwords, PEC seeks an order exempting it from the provisions of Illinois election law. \nThe plaintiffs oppose the proposed amendment, arguing that this court has no authority to\ngrant PEC a waiver from the provisions of the Illinois Election Code unless the state law violates\nthe federal Voting Rights Act.  \nPEC filed a reply to the plaintiffs’ response, followed by a motion for leave to file the\nreply.  Ordinarily, the court would strike PEC’s reply because this court’s Local Rules do not\nallow the filing of a reply to a response to a motion (unless the motion is for summary\njudgment).  CDIL-LR 7.1(B)(3) (no replies to responses permitted); 7.1(D)(3) (specifying format\nfor movant’s reply on summary judgment).  No matter; the points raised in the reply are\nunpersuasive.  The court briefly addresses each one in turn.\nFirst, PEC argues that the point of requesting an amendment to this court’s Consent\nDecree is to comply with, rather than violate, the federal Voting Rights Act.  PEC states that the\nvotes of each at-large City Council election since 1988 have been counted centrally rather than at\nthe precinct level; they merely wish to continue what they have been doing all along.  But PEC\nfails to state how the recently-amended state election code conflicts with federal law or the\nConsent Decree.  The court will not second-guess the Illinois legislature’s desire to implement\nelectronic voting safeguards unless they conflict with federal law.  In this case, there is no\nconflict.  It is possible for PEC to comply fully with Illinois law and the Consent Decree.1             \n                                            \nSecond, PEC implies that its electronic voting System carries the imprimatur of the\n1 PEC cites to Perkins v. City of Chicago Heights, 47 F.3d 212, 216 (7th Cir. 1995) for\nthe proposition that state law cannot prevent a necessary remedy to a violation of federal law. \nHowever, the state law PEC seeks to avoid does not prevent it from fulfilling its obligation\npursuant to the Consent Decree.  PEC also cites to Harper v. City of Chicago Heights, 223 F.3d\n593, 601 (7th Cir. 2000) (modifying a form of government that is in conformance with Illinois\nlaw “cannot be made by a consent decree unless the court finds that the [Illinois law] would\nviolate federal law and that such changes are necessary to ensure compliance with federal law.”) \n(citing Perkins, 47 F.3d at 217).  Neither case is helpful to PEC.  \n2\n\nfederal government because it received a federal grant to purchase the System.  PEC describes\nthe benefits of electronic voting over punch card and paper balloting.  PEC further states that the\nSystem is the most efficient system, overall, for all its federal, state and local elections, except\nthe elections for the at-large City Council elections.  The court fails to see how the benefits of\nelectronic voting and PEC’s overall convenience are factors entitling it to relief from the\nrequirements of the Illinois Election Code. \nThird, PEC argues that the court should amend the Consent Decree because write-in\nvotes, absentee votes, early votes, provisional votes and grace period votes will be counted\ncentrally, so the vote totals compiled at each precinct will not be final totals.  While this may be\nso, there is no indication that the state legislature enacted the electronic voting safeguards to\nprovide a final precinct total.  Rather, the statutory procedure is meant to provide only a\nprecinct-level tally of electronic votes. \nIn sum, PEC’s assertions point to one central fact: it purchased an electronic voting\nsystem without considering the requirements of the Consent Decree and state law.  Now it wants\nto obtain permission from this court to sidestep state law because PEC must comply with a\nfederal Consent Decree.  In this case, there is no reason that PEC cannot comply with both.  As\nPEC readily admits, “a significant redevelopment effort would be required to re-engineer the\ntabulation routines . . . to accommodate the counting of fractional cumulative votes at the\nprecinct level.”  It may be inconvenient or expensive, but nowhere does PEC state it is\nimpossible.\nCONCLUSION\nThe motion to amend the consent decree [#27] is denied.  The motion to transfer this case\nto the Peoria Division is [#28] denied.  The motion for leave to file a reply to the plaintiffs’\nresponse [#33] is denied as moot.\nEntered this 21st day of July, 2006.\ns\\Harold A. Baker\n_________________________________\nHAROLD A.

Day, Jr., and in reply to the Plaintiffs’ Response To Defendant’s Motion To Amend \nThe Amended Final Consent Decree states as follows: \nI.  The Amended Consent Decree Was Entered To Rectify A Violation  \n  Of The Voting Rights Act And Defendant’s Motion Seeks Authority  \n  To Accomplish The Implementation Of That Consent Decree. \n \n  The argument set forth by the Plaintiffs in their Response is that this court is \nwithout authority to vary the provisions of state law absent a finding that state law \nviolates the Voting Rights Act. This argument, however, misses the point of the Peoria \nElection Commission’s Motion requesting an amendment to the Consent Decree which \namendment would allow the Peoria Election Commission to count the votes cast for the \noffice Peoria City Council at-large at said Commission’s office as opposed to counting \nthose votes at each precinct. The very purpose of the Election Commission’s Motion is \nto allow it to conduct at-large Peoria City Council elections that will comply with the \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 32    Filed: 06/23/06    Page 2 of 8 \nConsent Decree that was entered in this case August 10, 1988 so that the federal \nVoting Rights Act will not be violated.   \n  The Consent Decree ordered the City of Peoria to use cumulative voting for its \n at-large City Council elections so that the Voting Rights Act would not be violated. In \norder for the Peoria Election Commission to continue to follow this Federal court order \nwhile conducting at-large City Council elections with its new electronic voting system, it \nhas requested authorization from this Court to deviate from state law by counting the \ncumulative votes centrally at the Election Commission’s office as opposed to counting \nthose votes at each precinct. Such a deviation in no way changes the manner in which \nthe Peoria Election Commission has counted cumulative votes in at-large City Council \nelections since the entry of the Consent Decree in 1988. Each one of the City Council \nat-large elections which have been conducted since 1988 has had its cumulative votes \ncounted centrally at the Election Commission’s office. All the Peoria Election \nCommission’s Motion does is seek the right to continue that method of counting \ncumulative votes which conducting such elections using its electronic voting system.  \n  In their Response, the Plaintiffs cite the cases of Perkins vs. City of Chicago \nHeights 47 F.3d 212, (C.A.7) Ill. (1995) and Harper vs. City of Chicago Heights 223 F.3d \n593 (C.A.7) Ill. (2000). However, a reading of these cases show that they more readily \nsupport the Election Commission’s Motion, than they provide precedent to oppose it.  \n  The case of Perkins v. City of Chicago Heights 47 F.3d 212 (C.A.7) Ill. (1995) \nwas based on the federal Voting Rights Act and the plaintiffs alleged that Chicago \nHeights’ non-partisan, at-large district wide elections to elect members of Chicago \nHeights City Council violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by diluting the \n  2 \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 32    Filed: 06/23/06    Page 3 of 8 \nopportunity of African-Americans to elect representatives of their choice. In attempting \nto fashion a remedy and settlement of the case, the plaintiffs and the City of Chicago \nHeights entered into a consent decree that established a form of municipal government \nthat was not statutorily provided for under Illinois law. On appeal the U.S. Seventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s approval of this consent decree on the \ngrounds that the parties did not have the authority to provide for a form of municipal \ngovernment in a consent decree that was not provided for by state law.  \n  In explaining its decision, the Appellate Court went on to state that a federal \nDistrict Court can approve a consent decree which overrides state law provisions when \nsuch a remedy is necessary to rectify a violation of federal law. At 47 F.3d page 216 the \nAppellate Court in Perkins stated as follows:  \n    “Once  a  court  has found  a federal  constitutional  or  statutory  violation, \n  however, a state law cannot prevent a necessary remedy. Under the Supremacy \n  Clause,  the  federal  remedy  prevails.  “To  hold  otherwise  would  fail  to  take \n  account of the obligations of local governments, under the Supremacy Clause, to \n  fulfill  the  requirements  that  the  Constitution  imposes  on  them.”  Missouri  v. \n  Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 57-58, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 1666, 109 L.E.d.2d 31 (1990). \n  Thus,  upon  properly  supported  findings  that  such  a  remedy  is  necessary  to \n  rectify a violation of federal law, the district court can approve a consent decree \n  which overrides state law provisions.” \n \n(The appellate court’s decision in Harper v. City of Chicago Heights 223 F.3d 593 at 601  \n \ncited with approval this part of the holding in the Perkins decision) \n  In the present case the Amended Consent Decree has already been approved by \nthis Court because the cumulative voting remedy set forth in the Consent Decree was \nfound to be necessary to rectify a violation of the Federal Voting Rights Act. In its \nMotion, the Peoria Election Commission states that in order to effectuate the provisions \nof the Consent Decree it is necessary for the Peoria Election Commission to conduct \n  3 \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 32    Filed: 06/23/06    Page 4 of 8 \ncumulative voting elections for at-large City Council seats and that a provision of the \nIllinois Election Code, Section 24C-12, should not be allowed to prevent the Election \nCommission from conducting cumulative voting elections using its current electronic \nvoting system. It is logical that if a federal District Court has the authority to approve a \nConsent Decree which overrides state law because the Consent Decree is necessary to \nrectify a violation of federal law, then that same District Court has the authority to \noverride state law in order to accomplish the implementation of that Consent Decree. \nThis is all that the Peoria Election Commission’s Motion in the present case is \nrequesting.   \nII.  There Are Significant Advantages To Using A Direct Recording \nElectronic Voting System In The Elections Which The Peoria  \n  Election Commission Administers. \n \n  The Peoria Election Commission is prepared to present evidence at a hearing on \nits Motion to show that the technology in voting equipment used to conduct elections in \nthis state and across the nation has changed significantly since 1988 when the Consent \nDecree was entered. This technology includes, but is not limited to, conducting elections \nwithout the need for printing paper ballots by allowing voters to cast their votes \nelectronically by touching the name of the candidate of their choice on a computer \nscreen and thereby registering their vote for that candidate. In addition to eliminating the \nneed to print paper ballots for each election, such voting systems have the advantage of \ninforming a voter if he has overvoted for a particular office and of allowing the vote tally \nat the close of the polls to be virtually instantaneous. The United States Congress \npassed the Help America Vote Act of 2002 which became effective October 29, 2002. \nThat Act provided, among other things, for Federal grants for election authorities that \n  4 \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 32    Filed: 06/23/06    Page 5 of 8 \nwished to switch from punch card and other paper ballot type voting systems to \nelectronic voting systems. The Peoria Election Commission applied for and received \nsuch a grant and, after considering various types of voting systems available, \ndetermined that the Hart e Slate Voting System was the best system available for its \npurposes.  \n  It should be noted that the Peoria Election Commission conducts a total of not \nless than eight elections over a given four year period including, obviously, elections for \nUnited States President, United States Senator, United States House of Representative, \nIllinois Governor and all other Illinois State and Peoria City and County offices. Only two \nof these eight elections over any four year period include an election for at-large City \nCouncil for the City of Peoria. Thus, if the Peoria Election Commission determines that \nall of the elections which it conducts can be more efficiently conducted by using an \nelectronic voting system such as the e Slate Voting System, it only makes sense to \npurchase such a voting system. The fact that purchasing such a system requires it to \ncount only the votes for the office of at-large City Council seats at a central location \ndoes not seem a good reason not to purchase the e Slate Voting System, when it has \nbeen determined by the Commission that it is the best voting system for conducting all \nof the other elections which it is called upon to administer. This is particularly true in \nlight of the fact that counting cumulative votes for at-large City Council centrally is the \nsame way that votes in at-large City Council elections have been counted in every such \nelection since the Amended Consent Decree was entered in 1988.  \n \n  5 \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 32    Filed: 06/23/06    Page 6 of 8 \nIII.  Because Write-In Votes, Absentee Votes, Early Votes, Provisional \nVotes and Grace Period Votes Are Counted Centrally, The Vote \nTotals Posted At The Precinct Are Not Final Totals Anyway. \n \n  A further reason for this Court to grant the Peoria Election Commission’s Motion \nis the fact that in May of 2006 the Illinois General Assembly passed Senate Bill 1445 \nwhich provides, among other things, that all absentee ballots, provisional ballots, early \nvoting ballots and grace period ballots shall henceforth be counted centrally at the \nelection authority’s central ballot counting location. New section 1-9 of the Illinois \nElection Code (10 ILCS 5/1-9) as passed by SB 1445 provides as follows: \n    Sec.  1-9.  Central  counting  of  grace  period,  early,  absentee,  and \n  provisional  ballots.  Notwithstanding  any  statutory  provision  to  the  contrary \n  enacted before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General \n  Assembly, all grace period ballots, early voting ballots, absentee ballots, and \n  provisional ballots to be counted shall be delivered to and counted at an election \n  authority’s central ballot counting location and not in precincts. References in this \n  Code  enacted  before  the  effective  date  of  this  amendatory  Act  of  the  94th \n  General Assembly to delivery and counting of grace period ballots, early voting \n  ballots, absentee ballots, or provisional ballots to or at a precinct polling place or \n  to  the proper  polling place  shall  be  construed  as  references  to  delivery  and \n  counting of those ballots to and at the election authority’s central ballot counting \n  location. \n \n  If SB 1445 is signed by the Governor (as of this writing it is reported to be on his \ndesk for his signature) and thus becomes law in Illinois, every election in Illinois will \nhave ballots which are required to be counted centrally after the close of the polls, given \nthe fact that every election will have one or more absentee ballots, provisional ballots, \nearly voted ballots or grace period ballots. Thus, the vote totals which are compiled by \nthe voting machines in each precinct after the polls close on election day will not be final \nvote totals because of the fact that the votes counted at the central ballot counting \nlocation after the polls close will have to be added to these precinct vote totals. It should \nalso be noted that if there is a valid write-in candidate for a given election, including an \n  6 \n\n2:87-cv-02371-HAB-DGB   # 32    Filed: 06/23/06    Page 7 of 8 \nelection for at-large Peoria City Council candidates, the determination as to whether \neach write-in vote is valid and should be counted is made at the central office of the \nPeoria Election Commission by a team of two election judges. This being the case, any \nvote totals made by the voting machines in the precincts at the close of the polls would \nnot be final totals since the write-ins counted centrally would have to be added to those \ntotals. Since vote totals posted at the precinct at the close of the polls are not final totals \nanyway, allowing the Peoria Election Commission to count the cumulative votes cast in \nthe precinct for an at-large City Council election at the central ballot counting location \nwill allow those votes to be counted at the same time and location as the cumulative \nvotes that were cast by absentee voters and early voters and provisional and grace \nperiod voters and write-in votes for the same City Council election.  \n  For the reasons stated above, Defendant, Peoria Election Commission, \nrespectfully requests that its Motion To Amend The Amended Final Consent Decree \nentered in this case on August 10, 1988 be granted and that the Peoria Election \nCommission be allowed to count votes cast in elections for at-large Peoria City Council \nseats in the Primary and General elections for those seats at the office of the Peoria \nCity Election Commission in Peoria, Illinois.  \n \n            s/ Robert G.

Day, Jr., and moves this court for the \nentry of an order amending the Amended Final Consent Decree entered in this \ncase on August 10, 1988 and for reasons states as follows:   \n1.  That on August 10, 1988, this court entered in this case a \ndocument entitled Amended Final Consent Decree And Full Resolution Of Action \nwhich document incorporated “Amended Exhibit B”, which was entitled \n“Amended Electoral Structure For The City Council” (Copies of both of these \ndocuments are attached hereto.) Amended Exhibit B provided that the City \nCouncil of the City of Peoria shall consist of 5 members elected from single-\nmember districts and 5 members elected at-large.  \n2.  That said Amended Final Consent Decree provided that the 5 at-\nlarge City Council seats shall be elected by means of cumulative voting such that \n\neach voter may vote for one, two, three, four or five candidates at such election. \nAmended Exhibit B to the said Consent Decree specifically stated in part as \nfollows with regard to such cumulative voting: \n“If a voter votes for just one candidate, that candidate shall receive five \nvotes. If a voter votes for just two candidates, each of those candidates \nshall receive 2½ votes. If a voter votes for just three candidates, each of \nthose  candidates  shall  receive  1  2/3  votes.  If  a  voter  votes  for  four \ncandidates, each of those candidates shall receive 1¼ votes. If a voter \nvotes for five candidates, each of those candidates shall receive 1 vote. \nThe  maximum  number  of  votes  each  voter  may  cast  in  the  at-large \nelections will be five. The five candidates who receive the highest number \nof votes in the general election will be declared the winners of the at-large \nseats.”   \n \n3.    That Section 24A-16 of the Election Code of the State of Illinois (10 \nILCS 5/24A-16) states that the Illinois State Board of Elections shall approve all \nvoting systems provided for by Article 24 of the Election Code of Illinois and \nSection 24A-3 of the Election Code of Illinois (10 ILCS 5/24A-3) provides that no \nCounty Board or Board of Election Commissioners may purchase or lease an \nelectronic voting system or voting system component without the approval of the \nState Board of Elections “as provided by Section 24A-16”.  \n4.  That at the present time there is no voting system which has been \napproved for use by the State Board of Elections for the counting and tallying of \ncumulative votes at the precinct where such votes are cast nor has any voting \nsystem been submitted to the State Board of Elections for testing to determine \nwhether it is capable of accurately counting and tallying cumulative votes at the \nprecinct where such votes are cast.  \n5.  That at the present time the only voting system which has been \ntested by the Illinois State Board of Elections to determine if it accurately counts \n  2 \n\nand tallies cumulative votes is the e Slate Voting System manufactured by Hart \nIntercivic, Inc. and this voting system provides for tabulating cumulative votes at \na central location as opposed to tabulating those votes at the precinct where the \nvotes are cast. This testing has shown that the e Slate Voting System is capable \nof accurately counting and tallying cumulative votes at a central location. (See \nAffidavit of Diane Felts of the Illinois State Board of Elections which is attached \nhereto, incorporated herein and made a part hereof.) \n6.  That the e Slate Voting System mentioned above which has been \ntested by the Illinois State Board of Elections is a Direct Recording Electronic \nVoting System as that term is defined in Section 24C-2 of the Illinois Election \nCode (10 ILCS 5/24C-2).  \n7.  That Section 24C-12 of the Illinois Election Code (10 ILCS 5/24C-\n12) provides, in part, that the votes cast on the Direct Recording Electronic \nVoting System shall be tabulated and one copy of the “Certificate of Results” of \neach tabulation shall be posted inside the polling place after the close of polls on \nelection day.    \n  8.  That since there has been no voting system to date tested or \ncertified by the Illinois State Board of Elections as being capable of counting and \ntallying  cumulative votes at the polling location where those votes are cast, there \nis no voting system available to the Peoria Election Commission which will allow \nit to conduct its primary and general election for the five at-large seats for City \nCouncil for the City of Peoria in the primary and general elections in 2007. \nTherefore, the Peoria Election Commission respectfully moves that this court \n  3 \n\nenter an order amending the Amended Final Consent Decree previously entered \nin this case by providing that votes cast in the 2007 elections for at-large Peoria \nCity Council seats in the general and primary elections for those seats may be \ncounted and tallied at the office of the Peoria Election Commission in Peoria, \nIllinois.  \n            s/ Robert G.

At the present time there is no voting system which has been approved for use \nby the State Board of Elections for the counting and tallying of cumulative votes at the \nprecinct where such votes are cast. \n  Attached to the Peoria Election Commission’s Second Motion To Amend The \nAmended Final Consent Decree filed in this case is the Affidavit of Dianne Felts, who is \nthe Director of Voting Systems and Standards for the Illinois State Board of Elections. In \nparagraph 4 of this Affidavit she states that there has been only one voting system \ntested by the Illinois State Board of Elections for the purpose of determining whether \nsuch system is capable of counting and tallying cumulative votes and that is a voting \nsystem manufactured by Hart Intercivic, Inc. (“Hart”) which system is referred to by Hart \nas the e Slate Voting System. Such testing has shown that the Hart e Slate Voting \nSystem is capable of accurately counting and tabulating cumulative votes at a central \nlocation, but is not capable of counting and tabulating cumulative votes at the precinct \nwhere the votes were cast. (see paragraph 4 of Felts Affidavit). \n  The Hart e Slate Voting System is a Direct Recording Electronic Voting System \nas that term is defined in Section 24C-2 of the Illinois Election Code (10 ILCS5/24C-2). \nSection 24C-12 of the Illinois Election Code (10 ILCS 5/24C-12) provides, in part, that \nthe votes cast on a Direct Recording Electronic Voting System shall be tabulated and \none copy of the “Certificate of Results” of each such tabulation shall be posted inside \nthe polling place after the close of the polls on election day. As stated above, the e Slate \nVoting System is the only voting system tested to date by the Illinois State Board of \n  2 \n\nElections to determine if it is capable of counting and tallying cumulative votes. \nHowever, since that voting system is not capable of counting and tallying cumulative \nvotes at the precinct where those votes were cast, it is not possible to comply with \nSection 24C-12  while using that voting system. Therefore, there is presently no voting \nsystem which has been approved by the Illinois State Board of Elections which the \nPeoria Election Commission can use to conduct its primary and general election in 2007 \nfor the five at-large seats on the Peoria City Council. The effect of this is that there is no \nvoting system presently approved for use in Illinois which will allow the Peoria Election \nCommission to conduct a cumulative voting election as required by the Amended Final \nConsent Decree entered in this case and not be in violation of Section 24C-12 of the \nIllinois Election Code. \n  The Amended Final Consent Decree was entered in this case as a remedy so \nthat the City of Peoria would not be in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act by the \nmanner in which the City elected its city council. A state law such as Section 24C-12 of \nthe Illinois Election Code should not be allowed to prevent the implementation of this \nremedy. Under the Supremacy Clause of this United Stated Constitution the federal \nremedy set out in this Court’s Amended Final Consent Decree should prevail over a \nstate law which would prevent the implementation of that remedy. Missouri V. Jenkins \n495 U.S. 33, 57-58, 110 S. Ct. 1651 at 1666, 109 L.E. 2d 31 (1990). See also Perkins \nV. City of Chicago Heights 47 F. 3d 212 at 216 (7th Cir. Ill. 1995). \n  In the case of Missouri V. Jenkins 495 U.S. 33, 110 S. Ct. 1651 109 L.Ed. 2d 31 \n(1990) the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri had imposed \nan increase in the property taxes levied by the Kansas City, Missouri School District \n  3 \n\n(KCMSD) as a remedy to ensure funding for the desegregation of KCMSD’s public \nschools. The school district appealed this decision arguing, among other things, that a \nMissouri state law limited the amount of such a tax levy and, therefore, the remedy \nordered by the court could not be implemented in this way because it would require the \nschool district to violate the state law that limited its authority to impose a tax levy \nbeyond that allowed by the law. In upholding the District Court’s authority to fashion the \nremedy contained in its court Order, the United States Supreme Court held that the \nMissouri state law could not hinder the remedy imposed by a federal court order issued \nto enforce federal constitutional guarantees. At 109 L. Ed. 2d 58 the U.S. Supreme \nCourt stated as follows: \n  “Here, the KCMSD may be ordered to levy taxes despite the statutory \n  limitations on its authority in order to compel the discharge of an obligation \n  imposed on KCMSD by the Fourteenth Amendment. To hold otherwise \n  would fail   to take account of the obligations of local governments,  under \n  the  Supremacy  Clause,  to fulfill  the  requirements  that the  Constitution \n  imposes  on  them.  However  wide  the  discretion  of  local  authorities  in \n  fashioning desegregation   remedies  may  be,  “if  a  state-imposed \n  limitation  on  a  school  authority’s  discretion  operates  to  inhibit  or \n  obstruct  the  operation  of  a  unitary  school  system  or  impede  the \n  disestablishing of a dual school system, it must fall; state policy must give   \n  way  when  it  operates  to  hinder  vindication  of  federal  constitutional \n  guarantees.”  North Carolina Bd. of Education v Swann, 402 US 43, 45, 28 \n  L Ed 2d 586, 91 S   Ct 1284 (1971). Even though a particular remedy may \n  not  be  required  in  every  case  to  vindicate  constitutional  guarantees, \n  where  (as  here)  it  has  been  found  that  a  particular  remedy  is \n  required,  the  State  cannot  hinder  the  process  by  preventing  a  local \n  government from implementing that remedy.” (underlining added) \n   \n  It is significant to note that the state law in question in Missouri V. Jenkins did not \nconflict with any federal law that required the desegregation ordered to that case. \nRather, the Missouri state law that limited the authority to levy taxes beyond a particular \nrate was a law that was impeding the implementation of a federal court ordered remedy, \n  4 \n\nthat being the funding for the desegregation of a school district. A similar situation exists \nin the present case where Section 24C-12 of the Illinois Election Code does not conflict \nwith the federal Voting Rights Act, but does impede the implementation of the court \nordered remedy of cumulative voting because it requires votes to be counted and tallied \nin each precinct when there is no voting system approved by the State Board of \nElections which is capable of counting and tallying cumulative votes in the precinct. For \nthis reason, this court is respectfully requested to enter an Order amending the \nAmended Final Consent Decree previously entered in this case to provide that votes \ncast in the 2007 elections for at-large Peoria City Council seats may be counted and \ntallied at the office of the Peoria Election Commission in Peoria, Illinois, notwithstanding \nthe provisions of Section 24C-12 of the Illinois Election Code. \n \n          Respectfully Submitted, \n            s/ Robert G.

The defendants have complied with the amended final\nconsent decree since it was entered.  They now seek an amendment to allow the tabulation of\nfractional cumulative votes at a central location, an issue about which the consent decree is\nsilent.1  Illinois election law requires tabulation of electronic votes at each precinct. \nUnder Illinois law, (1) all electronic voting systems must be approved by the Illinois\nState Board of Elections;2 (2) no County Board or Board of Election Commissioners may\npurchase or lease an electronic voting system without the approval of the State Board of\nElections;3 and (3) all votes cast by electronic vote must be tabulated at the precinct and a copy\nof the tabulation posted inside the polling place after the close of polls on election day.4  The\ndefendants apparently purchased a system approved by the State Board of Elections, but the\nsystem cannot tabulate fractional cumulative votes at each polling place.  In fact, the defendants\nstate that there is no voting system at the present time that has been submitted to the State Board\nof Elections for testing to determine whether it is capable of accurately counting and tallying\ncumulative votes at the precinct where such votes are cast. \n1 The consent decree mandates the use of fractional cumulative voting for the Peoria City\nCouncil at large-seats.  It further specifies, “The elections in all other respects will be governed\nby the law of the State of Illinois.”  \n2 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24A-16.\n3 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24A-3.\n4 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24C-12.  \n1\n\nThe defendants urge the court to direct that vote counting be done at the central location\n– in essence, to create a conflict between federal and state law – so they may avoid the state law\nrequirement for tabulation at the polling place.  Although the defendants argue that there is no\nsystem that will allow them to comply with both the consent decree and state election law, they\nmean to say there is no electronic voting system that allows them to comply with both; after all,\nthey have been complying with the consent decree for eighteen years. \nThe defendants cite no authority for the proposition that federal courts have jurisdiction\nto create a conflict where none exists.  They are ordered to supplement their memorandum of law\nwith authority supporting the proposition that state law must bend to facilitate compliance with a\nfederal consent decree where there is no conflict between the two.  The supplemental\nmemorandum incorporating such authority shall be filed on or before October 25, 2006.  \nEntered this 20th day of October, 2006.\ns\\Harold A.

The defendants argue, in their second motion, that there is no electronic system2\napproved by the State of Illinois Board of Elections that allows them to count fractional\ncumulative votes at the precinct level.  They seek an order from this court to sidestep the state\nlaw requiring a tally of electronic votes at the precinct level.  \nThis court ordered the defendants to file, on or before October 25, 2006, a supplemental\nmemorandum citing authority to support the proposition that state law must bend to facilitate\n1 The consent decree mandates the use of fractional cumulative voting for the Peoria City\nCouncil at large-seats.

The defendants have been operating under the consent decree for almost twenty years; the\nconsent decree does not mandate voting by electronic means.  The court lacks jurisdiction to\ncreate a conflict between federal and state law by amending the consent decree to require the\ntally of electronic votes at a central location.  \nConsequently, the court denies the second motion to amend the amended final consent\ndecree [#35]. \nEntered this 3rd day of November, 2006.\n          s\\Harold A.
