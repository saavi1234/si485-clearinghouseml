    "summary": "<p>This case alleged malapportioned districting in Mississippi in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>On November 21, 2011, seven African-American adults, representing each of Mississippi&rsquo;s four congressional districts, filed a class-action complaint against the governor of Mississippi, the state Attorney General, the state Secretary of State, the Mississippi Republican Party Executive Committee, the Mississippi Democratic Party Executive Committee, and the Chairman of the Tunica County, Mississippi Board of Election Commissioners in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the existing congressional districting scheme&mdash;based on a court-ordered plan stemming from a 2002 case&mdash;contained malapportioned districts violating the one person, one vote principle of Article I, Section 2 of and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. They submitted their own plan and requested injunctive relief requiring the 2012 congressional elections to be conducted on their plan.</p>\r\n<p>On November 29, 2011, the Fifth Circuit appointed a three-judge district court to hear the case. On December 7, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against all defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 19, 2011, the district court panel entered an order consolidating the case with Smith, et al. v. Clark, et al., (now, Smith v. Hosemann), Civil Action No. 3:01-cv-855 WS, in the interest of judicial economy and conflict preclusion. The Court also filed its own proposed redistricting plan and invited input from the parties. No objections to the Court plan were received. On December 30, 2011, the panel entered a final judgment ordering that defendants implement the court-proposed redistricting plan.</p>\r\n<p>In 2020, the Decennial Census rendered the four districts in the court-drawn plan malapportioned. On January 24, 2022, Mississippi governor signed into law a new four-district congressional redistricting statute. That same day, the Mississippi Republican party filed a motion to vacate the December 2011 final judgment. After supplemental briefing, the panel granted in part and denied in part: the panel vacated the December 2011 judgment in its entirety but declined to address the legality or constitutionality of the redistricting bill. The panel found that there had been significant changes in both the factual conditions and law since the court entered final judgment, holding that it was inequitable under Rule 60(b)(5) for the 2011 final judgment to continue to be applied prospectively and to require Mississippi to continue using the map drawn by the court until the state created a congressional redistricting plan that was constitutional and precleared in accordance with the procedures in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the final judgment. On June 8, 2022, the plaintiffs also filed a motion to alter the judgment. The panel ultimately denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motions on July 25, 2022. On September 22, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. On February 21, 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The case is closed.</p>",

R. Civ. P. 42(a), and move the Court to consolidate this case\nwith the case filed in this Court and styled John Robert Smith, et. al. v. Eric Clark, Secretary of State\nof Mississippi, et. al., Civil Action No. 3:01-CV-855WS on the following grounds:\n1Plaintiffs filed the case as a class action.  However, plaintiffs have not filed a formal\nmotion for class certification yet.\n1\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00717-HTW-EGJ-DCB   Document 7    Filed 12/07/11   Page 2 of 4\n1. The instant case and the case styled John Robert Smith, et. al. v. Eric Clark, Secretary\nof State of Mississippi, et. al., Civil Action No. 3:01-CV-855WS involve a common question of law.2\nThe common question of law is whether or not current congressional districts are unconstitutionally\nmalapportioned.\n2. The instant case is not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel3 nor the doctrine\nof res judicata.  See, Oreck Direct, LLC v. Dyson, Inc., 560 F. 3d 398, 401 (5th Cir. 2009).\n3. The two cases are related, and consolidation would avoid duplicative litigation.  In\nsuch a situation, cases that are related should be consolidated.  See, American Home Assurance\nCompany v. Roxco, Ltd., 81 F. Supp. 2d 674 (S. D., Miss. 1999).\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, plaintiffs move to consolidate the instant\ncase with the case filed in this Court and styled John Robert Smith, et. al. v. Eric Clark, Secretary\n2The cases do not involve a common question of fact.  The Court inquired at the hearing\nheld in styled John Robert Smith, et. al. v. Eric Clark, Secretary of State of Mississippi, et. al.,\nCivil Action No. 3:01-CV-855WS on November 22, 2011 whether the instant case is barred by\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel.  The answer is “ no”, the instant case is not barred by the\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel.  In order for collateral estoppel to “bar a lawsuit, three elements\nmust exist: 1) the issue at stake must be identical to the one involved in the prior litigation; 2) the\ndetermination of the issue in the prior litigation must have been a critical, necessary part of the\njudgment in that earlier action; and 3) the special circumstances must not exist which would\nrender preclusion inappropriate or unfair.” E. E. O. C. v. American Airlines, 48 F. 3d 164, 167\n(5th Cir. 1995), quoting, Texas Pig Stands, Inc. v. Hard Rock Café Int’l, Inc., 951 F. 2d 684, 691\n(5th Cir. 1992) (citing,  Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 154, 99 S. Ct. 970, 974, 59 L.\nEd. 2d 1979)).  See, also, Recoveredge L.P. v. Pentecost, 44 F. 3d 1284, 1290 (5th Cir. 1995). \nHowever, collateral estoppel applies “only when - the facts and the legal standard used to assess\nthe facts are the same in both proceedings.” Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., 162 F. 3d 827, 832\n(5th Cir. 1998).  When the relevant facts in the second case are significantly different from the\nfacts in the previous case, collateral estoppel does not apply.  Id.  See, also, Brister v. A.W.I., Inc.,\n946 F. 2d 350 (5th Cir. 1991);  E. E. O. C. v. American Airlines, supra.  The significant change\nand difference in the facts in the two cases constitutes a special circumstance which would render\npreclusion inappropriate or unfair.\n3See, footnote 2 above.\n2\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00717-HTW-EGJ-DCB   Document 7    Filed 12/07/11   Page 3 of 4\nof State of Mississippi, et. al., Civil Action No. 3:01-CV-855WS.\nTHIS, the 7th day of December, 2011.\nRespectfully submitted,\nKELVIN BUCK, THOMAS M.

CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:11-cv-717-HTW-EGJ-DB-LRA\nHALEY BARBOUR, in his official capacity as\nGovernor of the State of Mississippi, JIM HOOD,\nin his official capacity as Attorney General of the\nState of Mississippi, and DELBERT HOSEMANN,\nin his official capacity as Secretary of State of the\nState of Mississippi, as members of the State Board\nof Election Commissioners; THE MISSISSIPPI\nREPUBLICAN PARTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE;\nTHE MISSISSIPPI DEMOCRATIC PARTY EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE; and ELIJAH WILLIAMS, in his official\ncapacity as Chairman of the Tunica County, Mississippi\nBoard of Election Commissioners, on behalf of himself\nand all others similarly situated              DEFENDANTS\nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nCOME NOW the plaintiffs, Kelvin Buck, Thomas Plunkett, Jeanette Self, Christopher\nTaylor, James Crowell, Clarence Magee, and Hollis Watkins, on behalf of themselves and all others\nsimilarly situated,1 pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2284 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, and move the Court to\nissue a preliminary injunction enjoining congressional elections using the benchmark districts2 on\n1Plaintiffs filed the case as a class action.  However, plaintiffs have not filed a formal\nmotion for class certification yet.\n2The benchmark districts are the current congressional districts implemented by the Order\nof this Court in 2002 with the 2010 census data applied to those districts.\n1\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00717-HTW-EGJ-DCB   Document 8    Filed 12/08/11   Page 2 of 4\nthe following grounds:\n1. The benchmark districts violate the equal population principles of Article 1, Section\n2 and the 14th amended to the United States Constitution.  Compare, White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783\n(1973)  (congressional  reapportionment  plan  with  a  total  deviation  range  of  4.13%  was\nunconstitutional), with Connor v. Johnson, 279 F. Supp. 619 (S. D. Miss. 1966) (per curiam), aff’d,\n386 U. S. 483 (congressional reapportionment plan with a total deviation range of 3.20% was\nacceptable).   The total range of population deviation in the benchmark districts is 16.87%.  It would\nviolate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to conduct any election under this plan.  See, White v. Weiser,\nsupra; Smith v. Clark, 189 F. Supp. 2d 503 (S. D. Miss. 2002), aff’d, sub. nom., Branch v. Smith, 538\nU. S. 254 (2003).\n2. The Mississippi Legislature has failed in its duty to reapportion congressional districts\nin a timely manner prior to the 2012 congressional elections.  Consequently, this Court has an\nobligation to reapportion congressional districts in time for the 2012 congressional elections. Smith\nv. Clark, supra.\n3. Plaintiffs have drafted a new apportionment plan that satisfies the equal population\nrequirement of the United States Constitution.  That plan containing a map, statistical data, and\nreport is attached to plaintiffs’ amended complaint and incorporated herein by reference.  \n4. Plaintiffs request the Court to take judicial notice of the Court file and the 2010\ncensus data.\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, plaintiffs move the Court to enter a preliminary\ninjunction  enjoining  use  of  the  benchmark  plan  for  congressional  elections  in  2012  and\nimplementing the apportionment plan attached to plaintiffs’ amended complaint.\n2\n\nCase 3:11-cv-00717-HTW-EGJ-DCB   Document 8    Filed 12/08/11   Page 3 of 4\nSince the authorities for this motion are contained herein, plaintiffs request leave of court\nfrom the requirement of filing a separate memorandum of authorities.\nAnd, plaintiffs request general relief.\nTHIS, the 8th day of December, 2011.\nRespectfully submitted,\nKELVIN BUCK, THOMAS M.
