Sept. 28, 2021) (order denying motion to dismiss). In that case, the State of Illinois, like the State Board of Elections in the present case, raised the Eleventh Amendment's sovereign immunity protections as a basis for the State's Motion to Dismiss. In the Order by the Northern District, the Court denied the State of Illinois's motion to dismiss, holding that \"under the plan of the Convention doctrine, the Court finds that Plaintiffs may proceed against the State and the Board and denies the State and the Board's motion to dismiss the NVRA claim based on sovereign immunity.\" Id. at *3. Because neither Public Interest Legal Foundation nor the State Board of Elections discussed this issue in the briefing in the present case, the parties are DIRECTED to file, within 14 days, briefing on the issue of whether, under the plan of the convention doctrine, the State of Illinois, and thereby the Board of Elections, may be sued in federal court by private parties.

    "summary": "<p>The Plaintiff in this case alleged that Illinois Code Chapter 10 Section 5/1A-25 violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) based on requester's inability to view or copy a statewide voter registration list in full. While the NVRA mandates that the Illinois State Board of Elections (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) make the statewide voter registration list both available for inspection and available for photocopying at a reasonable cost, Section 5/1A-25 explicitly prohibits any printing, duplication, or transmission of the same list.</p>\r\n<p>Previously, Plaintiff Public Interest Legal Foundation (the &ldquo;Foundation&rdquo;) sent a letter to Board requesting an electronic copy of Illinois's statewide voter registration list. The Foundation received a response from the Board denying the Foundation's request and stating that &ldquo;any person may view the centralized statewide voter registration list on a computer screen at the Springfield office of the State Board of Elections, during normal business hours.&rdquo; A representative from the Foundation traveled to the Board's office to attempt to view the statewide voter registration list. Once there, the representative was given access to a program to search the list but was not allowed to either view the list in full or print, duplicate, or download the list. Instead, the representative was told that the statewide voter registration list can only be searched for a specific name or birthdate on the computer screen at the Springfield office but there is not a search option available that will retrieve the statewide voter registration list for viewing in its entirety. The Foundation was never allowed to view or copy the statewide voter registration list in full.</p>\r\n<p>The Foundation filed suit against Defendants on July 27, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, represented by itself and private counsel, alleging that Defendants' actions amounted to a single count of violating the NVRA. The case was assigned to Judge Sue E. Myerscough. Defendants moved to dismiss on October 5, 2020, arguing that the Board was entitled to sovereign immunity. The Foundation moved for summary judgment the following year, on July 31, and Defendants did the same two months later, on September 20.</p>\r\n<p>On March 8, 2022, the District Court granted Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, and denied the Board's motion for summary judgment and its directors' motion to dismiss (589 F.Supp.3d 932). The Court held that where the NVRA is allegedly violated by a state, the plan of the Convention doctrine applies. Under the plan of the Convention doctrine, the sovereign immunity afforded to States by the Eleventh Amendment will cease where a &ldquo;fundamental postulate[] implicit in the constitutional design&rdquo; begins. <em>PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey</em>, 141 S.Ct. 2244, 2258 (2021). The Board, as an agency of Illinois, was not entitled to sovereign immunity under the plan of the Convention doctrine and could be sued.</p>\r\n<p>The main question for the Court was whether Illinois's Section 5/1A-25 conflicts with the Public Disclosure Provision of the NVRA. If so, the state law, so far as the conflict extends, would cease to be operative. The Court found that Section 5/1A-25 does so conflict and is, therefore, preempted by the NVRA.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the Court held that the statewide voter registration list is a &ldquo;record&rdquo; within the meaning of the NVRA. See 52 U.S.C. &sect; 20507(i)(1) (mandating the public disclosure of &ldquo;all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of the official list of eligible voters&rdquo;). Thus, Illinois's Section 5/1A-25 is preempted by the NVRA.</p>\r\n<p>The Court held that Illinois's interest in protecting the privacy of its citizens is not so great as to permit noncompliance with the Public Disclosure Provision.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, the Court ordered Defendants to implement policies and procedures which make available to the public the statewide voter registration list, allowing for redaction of telephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, street numbers of home addresses, birthdates, identifiable portions of email addresses, and other highly sensitive personal information; and to pay the Foundation its attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2022, Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification, requesting the Court &ldquo;clarify its order granting Plaintiff an injunction by specifying in detail the policies and procedures Defendants must take to make the statewide voter registration list available to the public.&rdquo; The Court clarified its injunction: Photocopying would be &ldquo;at a reasonable cost,&rdquo; and the statewide voter registration list would be made available &ldquo;as identical a manner as practicable as those procedures used to effect the same for Illinois governmental and political entities&rdquo; (2022 WL 1174099).</p>\r\n<p>Later that month, on April 21, Plaintiff moved for attorneys' fees. Two months later, on June 8, the court granted Plaintiff $114,446.25 in costs and fees. As of November 2023, there has been no further docket activity.</p>",

Requester moved for summary judgment. Board and its directors also moved for summary judgment and moved to dismiss. The court denied the Board's and its directors' motions and granted Requester's motion, and held that (1) as matter of first impression, voter registration list was “record” subject to public disclosure provision of NVRA; (2) Illinois's interest in protecting citizens' privacy was not so great as to permit state to refrain from keeping voter registration list from public disclosure; and (3) Illinois law was preempted by NVRA. Therefore, the court granted Plaintiff a permanent injunction.",

R. Civ. P. 56, state as follows: \n  1.  Plaintiff has filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, asking this \nCourt to declare Defendants in violation of Section 8(i) of the National Voter Registration Act \n(NVRA) (52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1)) by refusing to allow Plaintiff to inspect and copy requested list \nmaintenance data and voter registration list. (Doc. 1, p. 10). \n2.  Plaintiff further asks this Court to declare Section 8(i) of the NVRA preempts and \nsupersedes 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) (Doc. 1, p. 10), which generally restricts those allowed to receive \na copy of voter registration list to State or local political committees and governmental entities, \n                                            \n1 Bernadette Matthews is the Acting Executive Director of the Illinois State Board of Elections, and therefore is \nautomatically substituted for former Executive Director Steve Sandvoss. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 25(d).  \n20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                      Page 1 of 4 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 29    Filed: 09/20/21    Page 2 of 4 \nexcept as otherwise provided under two exceptions within that statute. See 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) \n(West 2020). \n  3.  Plaintiff  requests  this  Court  order  Defendants  to  produce  the  statewide  list \nmaintenance data and voter registration list, permanently enjoin Defendants from denying requests \nto inspect similar list maintenance data attached to voter registration lists in the future. \n  4.  Defendants,  KYLE  THOMAS,  CHERYL  HOBSON,  and  ILLINOIS  STATE \nBOARD OF ELECTIONS, have filed a motion to dismiss, which is currently pending before the \nCourt. (Doc. 9). \n  5.  Defendants are entitled to summary judgment because the plain and unambiguous \nlanguage of Section 8(i) of the NVRA  only applies to “records concerning the implementation of \nprograms and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official \nlists of eligible voters,” not voter registration lists. See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1). \n  6.  The undisputed facts show Plaintiff was given access to the complete searchable \ndatabase of the Illinois voter registration database.  \n  7.  Plaintiff  fails  to  meet  its  burden  of  showing  Illinois’  modest  limitations  on \nobtaining copies of voter registration lists are preempted by the NVRA. \n  8.  The SBE is entitled to summary judgment because barring voluntary waiver or \ncongressional override it cannot be sued in federal court due to the State of Illinois’ sovereign \nimmunity under the Eleventh Amendment. \n  9.  Defendants Thomas and Hobson are entitled to summary judgment because they \nare not proper parties to this litigation. \n10.

MYERSCOUGH, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore the Court is a Motion for Reconsideration and \nClarification (d/e 40) filed by Defendants Bernadette Matthews, Kyle \nThomas, Cheryl Hobson, and the Illinois State Board of Elections \n(the “Board”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  Defendants do not raise \nany new issue, argument, or facts not considered by the Court in \nPage 1 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 2 of 9 \nthe Opinion and Order on Summary Judgment entered on March 8, \n2022 (d/e 37).  However, the Court will allow a minor clarification \nas to the production of the statewide voter registration list as \ndetailed in the Order.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion (d/e 40) is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \nI.  ANALYSIS \nOn March 8, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff the Public \nInterest Legal Foundation’s (the “Foundation”) Motion for Summary \nJudgment and denied Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment1.  \nSee (d/e 37).  The Court held that the statewide voter registration \nlist maintained by the Board is a “record” within the meaning of \nSection 8(i)(1) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 \n(“NVRA”).  52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1).  That section, referred to as the \nPublic Disclosure Provision, states  \nEach State shall maintain for at least 2 years \nand shall make available for public inspection \nand, where available, photocopying at a \nreasonable cost, all records concerning the \nimplementation of programs and activities \nconducted for the purpose of ensuring the \naccuracy and currency of official lists of \neligible voters. \n \n1 The Court assumes the reader’s familiarity with the facts of this case as stated in the Court’s \nOpinion and Order on Summary Judgment (d/e 37) and so does not repeat the facts here. \nPage 2 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 3 of 9 \nId.  The Court further held that the Illinois state law which \nprohibited the disclosure of the statewide voter registration list, 10 \nILCS 5/1A-25, conflicts with and is preempted by the Public \nDisclosure Provision.  See Op. & Order (d/e 37) p. 25–27.  \nAccordingly, the Court ordered the Defendants to  \nimplement policies and procedures which \nmake available to the public the statewide \nvoter registration list, allowing for redaction of \ntelephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, \nstreet numbers of home addresses, birthdates, \nidentifiable portions of email addresses, and \nother highly sensitive personal information. \n \nId.   \nOn April 4, 2022, Defendants filed their Motion for \nReconsideration and Clarification in which they request that the \nCourt reverse the Opinion and Order.  In the alternative, \nDefendants request the Court “clarify its order granting Plaintiff an \ninjunction by specifying in detail the policies and procedures \nDefendants must take to make the statewide voter registration list \navailable to the public.”  Defs.’ Mot. (d/e 40) p. 2. \nA party may move a Court to reconsider a previous ruling and \njudgment for reasons including mistake, newly discovered evidence, \nfraud, or “any other reason that justifies relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \nPage 3 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 4 of 9 \n60(b).  “Motions for reconsideration serve a limited function; to \ncorrect manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered \nevidence.”  Rothwell Cotton Co. v. Rosenthal & Co., 827 F.2d 246, \n251 (7th Cir. 1987) (quoting Keene Corp. v. Int’l Fidelity Ins. Co., \n561 F.Supp. 656, 665–66 (N.D. Ill. 1982), aff’d, 736 F.2d 388 (7th \nCir. 1984)).  Relief under Rule 60(b) is “an extraordinary remedy \nand is granted only in exceptional circumstances.”  McCormick v. \nCity of Chicago, 230 F.3d 319, 327 (7th Cir. 2000) (quoting \nDickerson v. Bd. of Educ. Of For Heights, Ill., 32 F.3d 1114, 1116 \n(7th Cir. 1994)). \nIn this case, reconsideration under Rule 60(b) is not \nwarranted.  Defendants request the Court reverse its Opinion and \nOrder but do not present any new evidence, fraud, or excusable \nneglect.  Instead, Defendant’s present the same arguments already \nmade in their Motion for Summary Judgment.  Specifically, \nDefendants argue that the Public Disclosure Provision does not \ninclude the statewide voter registration list because the Public \nDisclosure Provision references “all records concerning the \nimplementation of programs and activities conducted for the \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of \nPage 4 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 5 of 9 \neligible voters.”  Defs.’ Mot. for Recons. (d/e 40) pp. 3–5; Defs.’ \nMem. for Summ. J. (d/e 30) pp. 8–11.  The Court disagreed, holding \nthat the statewide voter registration list was necessarily included in \nthe term “all records” in the Public Disclosure Provision.  Op. & \nOrder (d/e 37) pp. 17–21.  Defendants do not now raise any new \narguments other than those previously addressed by the Court.  \nThe Court, therefore, finds that Defendants have not presented a \n“manifest error of law” warranting “an extraordinary remedy” under \nRule 60(b).   \nDefendants also request that the Court clarify the terms of the \ninjunctive relief granted in the Opinion and Order.  The terms of an \ninjunction are governed by Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  Rule 65(d) states that an injunction must “state the \nreasons why [the injunction] was issued; state [the injunction’s] \nterms specifically; and describe in reasonable detail . . . the act or \nacts restrained or required.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d). \nIn the Court’s Opinion and Order, the Court stated, \nSection 5/1A-25 conflicts with, and is \npreempted by, the Public Disclosure provision \ninsofar as Section 5/1A-25 prohibits the \nphotocopying and duplication of the same list.   \nPage 5 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 6 of 9 \nOp. & Order (d/e 38) p. 26.  In the Judgment entered alongside the \nOpinion and Order, the Court ordered Defendants to \nimplement policies and procedures which \nmake available to the public, and photocopying \nat a reasonable cost, the statewide voter \nregistration list, allowing for redaction of \ntelephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, \nstreet numbers of home addresses, birthdates, \nidentifiable portions of email addresses, and \nother highly sensitive personal information. \n \nJ. (d/e 38).   \nDefendants request the Court specify “in detail the policies \nand procedures Defendants must take to make the statewide voter \nregistration list available to the public.”  Defs.’ Mot (d/e 40) p. 5.  \nDefendants further request that the Court advise Defendants \nwhether the list must be made available electronically or otherwise \nor whether the list must be made available for download or be \nprinted.  Id.   \nBut “[t]here is a limit to what words can convey.  The more \nspecific the order, the more opportunities for evasion (‘loopholes’).”  \nScandia Down Corp. v. Euroquilt, Inc., 772 F.2d 1423, 1431 (7th \nCir. 1985).  As the Foundation points out, and as Defendants \nadmitted in their Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary \nPage 6 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 7 of 9 \nJudgment, Defendants have already established procedures and \npolicies for providing Illinois state entities and political committees \nthe statewide voter registration list.  See Defs.’ Resp. (d/e 32) p. 2 \n(admitting to Plaintiff’s statement that “Illinois permits only certain \nentities to obtain” the statewide voter registration list).  To now \nspecify how exactly Defendants are to comply with the Court’s order \nwould be to inappropriately announce a list of pre-approved \nmeasures which, in turn, would imply the unlawfulness of all \nothers, which the Court will not do.  Scandia Down, 772 F.2d at \n1431 (Upholding an injunction while noting that “[t]here are \nmillions of possible [lawful alternatives to the prohibited conduct] to \nwhich [defendant] could have turned.  Any effort to identify and \nprohibit one million of them would have left another million or more \nsubject to dispute.”)  Instead, the Court will reiterate below the \norder from the Judgment (d/e 38), with the only clarification that \nDefendants are ordered to treat requests from the public for viewing \nand photocopying, at a reasonable cost, the statewide voter \nregistration list the same as Defendants treat those requests by \ngovernmental or political entities. \n \nPage 7 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 8 of 9 \nII.  CONCLUSION \nDefendants have not shown that they are entitled to the \nextraordinary relief available under Rule 60(b).  However, the Court \nwill allow a minor clarification to the previously entered Order.  \nTherefore, Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration and Clarification \n(d/e 40) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  Lastly, \nbecause Plaintiff was required to prepare a response to Defendants’ \nMotion, the Court allows Plaintiff’s request for additional time to \nsupplement its motion for attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses.  See \nPl.’s Resp. (d/e 41) n. 1.  Plaintiff shall file its supplemented motion \nby April 28, 2022.  All other unmodified orders are to remain the \nsame.  \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED \nthat: \n1) Illinois Code Title 10 Section 5/1A-25 conflicts with, \nand is preempted by, the Section 8(i)(1) of the Notional \nVoter Registration Act of 1993, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1), \ninsofar as Section 5/1A-25 prohibits the availability, \nphotocopying, and duplication of the same list; and \nPage 8 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 42    Page 9 of 9 \n2) Defendants are hereby ORDERED to implement policies \nand procedures which make available to the public, and \nphotocopying at a reasonable cost, the statewide voter \nregistration list in as identical a manner as practicable \nas those procedures used to effect the same for Illinois \ngovernmental and political entities, allowing for \nredaction of telephone numbers, Social Security \nNumbers, street numbers of home addresses, birthdates, \nidentifiable portions of email addresses, and other \nhighly sensitive personal information. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nENTERED: April 20, 2022. \nFOR THE COURT \n \n            /s/ Sue E.

For reasons fully explained and \nsupported below, Defendants’ motion should be denied. \nNATURE OF THE CASE \n \nOver a year ago, the Foundation requested a copy of the statewide voter registration list so \nthat it could begin analyzing the state’s voter roll for its accuracy and currency before the 2020 \ngeneral election. The Foundation employed a consulting data analytics firm to help identify \ndeceased  registrants,  as  well  as  those  incorrectly  registered  using  commercial  addresses  or \ninadvertently registered more than once. \nThe Foundation requested access to information that Congress intended to be publicly \navailable. As a matter of federal law, the Foundation’s right to inspect the requested information \n  1 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 2 of 10 \nis clear. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (“NVRA”) contains a broad and essential \ntransparency mandate. Section 8 provides that: \nEach State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall make available for public \ninspection and, where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all records \nconcerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters[.] \n52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) (emphasis added). \nDespite unambiguous statutory directives, the Defendants have refused to provide Plaintiff \naccess to the registration list for well over a year. Rather than explain themselves, Defendants \nappear  to be  denying their  statutory obligations by seeking dismissal  of  the  Board and its \nemployees, leaving only the Director of the Board, who has already denied that he has a duty to \nproduce the voter registration list under the NVRA. See Doc. 8, Answer, p. 20, denying allegations \nin ¶ 35. If allowed, such hide-the-ball tactics will only prolong Plaintiff’s rightful receipt of public \ninformation and diminish its ability to make good use of it before the general election. \nARGUMENT AS TO THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS \n \nThe State Board of Elections (“Board”) has moved to dismiss itself claiming that it is \nimmune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The Board, however, is a proper party because \nthe NVRA provides for a private right of action against state entities tasked with following the \nAct. The Board is also a proper party under the Ex Parte Young exception to state immunity. Ex \nParte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). \nI.  Congress has “Overridden” the Board’s Immunity by Expressly Including a \nPrivate Right of Action Against State Entities That Violate the NVRA. \nThe immunity afforded by the Eleventh Amendment extends to state agencies. Turner v. \nIllinois, No. 17-cv-3308, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126649, at *7 (C.D. Ill. July 26, 2018) (citation \nomitted). It is not, however, absolute. MCI Telcoms. Corp. v. Ill. Bell Tel. Co., 222 F.3d 323, 337 \n  2 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 3 of 10 \n(7th Cir. 2000). There are three principal types of exceptions to the Eleventh Amendment's bar. \nId. First, a state may waive immunity by consenting to suit in federal court. The Board has not \ndone so in this instance. The second exception is when Congress abrogates the state's immunity \nthrough a valid exercise of its powers under recognized constitutional authority, such as by later \nconstitutional amendments. Id. And third, under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908), a \nplaintiff may file “suit against state officials seeking prospective equitable relief for ongoing \nviolations of federal law . . .” Marie O. v. Edgar, 131 F.3d 610, 615 (7th Cir. 1997). \nIn its motion, the Board admits that its claim to state immunity would be barred if Congress \nhad “expressly overridden the State’s immunity for the NVRA.” See Doc. 8, p. 5. Plaintiff agrees, \nwhich is why it cited the NVRA’s private right of action, 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b) in its jurisdictional \nstatement and produces it below: \n(b)Private right of action \n \n(1) A person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may provide written notice of \nthe violation to the chief election official of the State involved. \n(2) If the violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph \n(1), or within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within 120 days \nbefore the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may bring a civil \naction in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the \nviolation. \n(3) If the violation occurred within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal office, \nthe aggrieved person need not provide notice to the chief election official of the State under \nparagraph (1) before bringing a civil action under paragraph (2). \n \n52 U.S.C. § 20510. \n \nSince it is only state entities that are responsible for following the NVRA, Congress clearly \nintended for state entities to be sued for violations of the NVRA. Under the Supremacy Clause, \n“[a]s long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution,” as it did with the \nNVRA, “Congress may impose its will on the States.” Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 584 (2009). \n  3 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 4 of 10 \nHere, Congress clearly abrogated the state’s immunity when it created a private right of action to \nsue the state’s chief election official for violations of the NVRA. In this case, the state’s chief \nelection official is the Board. \nII.  The State Board of Elections is the State’s Only Election Administration Entity \nand the Only Entity Responsible for Complying with the NVRA. \n \nUnlike most states, when the state legislature of Illinois enacted an Election Code, it did \nnot identify a state official as its chief election official in charge of election administration. Instead, \nit placed the responsibility on an entity, the State Board of Elections. 10 ILCS 5/1A-8(1). Of the \nfifty states, forty have identified their Secretary of State as the Chief Election Official. See \nhttps://www.nass.org/membership (last accessed 10/19/20). Illinois is one of the ten that has not. \nSee https://www.nass.org/node/54 (last accessed 10/19/20). As a result, Illinois has intentionally \nplaced an entity in charge of election administration, rather than an individual. There is no other \nelection official higher than the Board. Indeed, the Illinois Election Code contains 209 separate \nreferences to the Board alone, each describing another one of its functions or responsibilities, \nincluding several regarding its duties under  the  NVRA. See  e.g., 10 ILCS 5/1A-16 (Voter \nregistration information); 10 ILCS 5/1A-16.2 (automatic voter registration); 10 ILCS 5/1A-16.6 \n(government agency voter registration) and 10 ILCS 5/1A-16.7 (designating the Board to work \nwith the national Electronic Registration Information Center, stating that voter registration must \ncomply with the NVRA, appointing the Board to track registration data, and to submit an annual \nreport to the General Assembly “detailing the progress made to implement this Section.”). The \nElection Code also makes clear that the Board is to implement the entire Election Code in \naccordance with the provisions of the NVRA: \nSec. 1A-16. Voter registration information; Internet posting; processing of \nvoter registration forms; content of such forms. Notwithstanding any law to the \ncontrary, the following provisions shall apply to voter registration under this Code. \n  4 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 5 of 10 \n(d-5)  Compliance  with  federal  law;  rulemaking  authority.  The  voter \nregistration  form  described  in  this  Section  shall  be  consistent  with  the  form \nprescribed  by  the  Federal  Election  Commission  under  the  National  Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993, P.L. 103-31, as amended from time to time, and the Help \nAmerica Vote Act of 2002, P.L. 107-252, in all relevant respects. The State Board \nof Elections shall periodically update the form based on changes to federal or State \nlaw. The State Board of Elections shall promulgate any rules necessary for the \nimplementation of this Section; provided that the rules comport with the letter and \nspirit of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and Help America Vote Act \nof 2002 and maximize the opportunity for a person to register to vote. \n \n10 ILCS 5/1A-16 (emphasis added). \n \nThe Board’s responsibility was confirmed in Defendant Sandvoss’s Answer to Plaintiff’s \nComplaint, in which he admitted that the Board has the “duties and responsibilities” “to supervise \nthe administration of the registration and election laws throughout the State of Illinois.” See Doc. \n8, p. 12, Answer to ¶ 4. He further admitted that his role as Executive Director was to “exercise \ngeneral supervision over the operation of the business of the Board and its equipment, facilities, \nemployees and consultants, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board and as \notherwise directed by the Board.” See Doc. 8, p. 13, Answer to ¶ 5. \nThe current motion to dismiss, when viewed in the context of Defendant Sandvoss’s \nAnswer,  is  setting  up  a  scenario  in  which  NO  ONE  accepts  responsibility  for  the  State’s \ncompliance with the NVRA. Defendant Sandvoss states that it is the Board’s job. The Board argues \nthat it is immune from suit because it is an entity. And the remaining two Directors, who are \nemployees of the Board, argue that their “Division is not responsible for enforcing the NVRA \nand/or ensuring State compliance with the disclosure provision of the NVRA.” See Doc. 10, p. 7. \nSomeone must be responsible for enforcing federal election law in Illinois.  The NVRA \nprovides that it is the state’s chief election official. 52 U.S.C. § 20509. Because Congress has \nexpressly provided a private right of action against a state’s chief election official to enforce the \nNVRA, Congress has provided a right of action against the Board. 52 U.S.C. § 20510. \n  5 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 6 of 10 \nIII.  The Board’s Claim to Immunity is Also Negated Because the Ex parte Young \nException to the Eleventh Amendment Bar Applies. \n \nEven if Congress had not abrogated state immunity with the NVRA’s express private right \nof action to enforce the Act, the Board is still not immune under the Ex parte Young doctrine. 209 \nU.S. 123, 159-160 (1908). The Ex parte Young doctrine holds that state immunity does not shield \na state from a suit designed to stop an ongoing violation of federal law. 209 U.S. 123, 159-160 \n(1908). \nThis  Court  recently  agreed.  “[S]tate  officials  generally  enjoy  Eleventh  Amendment \nsovereign immunity except as to claims for injunctive relief that designed to end a continuing \nviolation of federal law.” Jones v. Conklin, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189760, *4 (C.D. Ill. October \n14, 2020) (citing Watkins v. Blinzinger, 789 F.2d 474, 483-84 (7th Cir. 1986)). “A court applying \nthe Ex parte Young doctrine now ‘need only conduct a straightforward inquiry’ into whether [the] \ncomplaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as \nprospective.” Ind. Prot. & Advocacy Servs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs. Admin., 603 F.3d 365, \n371, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 8380, *15 (7th Cir. Ind. April 22, 2010). \nHere, the Foundation’s allegation is that the Defendants are violating the NVRA’s public \ndisclosure provision and are in continuous violation of federal law. It is continuous because the \npublic records have not yet been produced yet remain requested pursuant to the public disclosure \nprovision of the NVRA. The Foundation’s request for declaratory and injunctive relief further \nsupports the doctrine’s application. “Under Young, state officials may be sued in their official \ncapacities for injunctive relief, although they may not be sued for money damages.” MSA Realty \nCorp. v. Illinois, 990 F.2d 288, 291 (7th Cir. 1993). Here, the Foundation seeks injunctive relief \nin the form of the records it is due. \n  6 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 7 of 10 \nBecause the Foundation has stated an ongoing violation of a federal law, and the facts are \nto be taken as true, the Ex parte Young doctrine bars the Board’s immunity from suit. As a result, \nthe Board has no immunity and is a proper party. \nARGUMENT AS TO THE BOARD’S EMPLOYEES \n \nDefendants Thomas, Director of Voting Systems and Registration, and Hobson, Deputy \nDirector of Voting and Registration, have asked the Court to dismiss them under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6), arguing that the Foundation failed to state a claim against them upon which relief can be \ngranted. Specifically, both employees argue that they should be dismissed because neither has \n“enforcement power pursuant to the NVRA.” See Doc. 10, p. 4. \nBecause the requested records are clearly subject to the NVRA’s disclosure provision, the \nComplaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted. Whether or not the employees who \ninteracted with the Foundation in responding to its request had the “authority to enforce the \nNVRA” is irrelevant. They had the authority to produce the registration list for inspection, and \nthey failed to do so.  Their motion should be denied. \nIV.  The Foundation Has Stated a Claim for Relief Because the Requested Records Are \nSubject to Inspection Under the Plain Terms of the NVRA. \nIn an action to enforce the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision, a complaint states a claim \nupon which relief may be granted if the requested records are subject to disclosure under the plain \nand ordinary meaning of the terms of the NVRA. Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc. v. Long, 752 \nF. Supp. 2d 697, 705 (E.D. Va. 2010) (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1)) The Fourth Circuit \nawarded summary judgment under the same standard. Project Vote, 682 F.3d at 335-337. The Fifth \nCircuit ruled similarly, denying a motion to dismiss the Foundation’s claims, concluding that \n“PILF has alleged a plausible claim under the public disclosure provisions of § 20507(i).” Public \nInterest Legal Found. v. Bennett, No. H-18-0981, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39723, at *10 (S.D. Tex. \n  7 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 8 of 10 \nFeb. 6, 2019).  Here, the Foundation properly alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under the \nNVRA’s public disclosure provision, and Defendants have not alleged otherwise. \nIV.  Defendants Are Responsible for Providing the Public Access to the Voter \nRegistration List. \n \nDefendants Thomas and Hobson are employees of the Board who have each been delegated \nsupervisory responsibility over the state’s various voter registration activities. In their motion, they \neven admit that their Division is “responsible for all requests from registered political committees \nfor computerized voter data.” See Doc. 10, p. 7. That is precisely why they have been sued: they \nrefused to provide the Foundation access to computerized voter data. In addition to the NVRA \npublic disclosure provision, state law requires that such data be made available (10 ILCS 5/1A- \n25(4). As supervisors, they have authority to direct their employees to complete the tasks the \nDivision is assigned. Providing access to the registration list falls within their assignments under \nstate law, as well as federal law. Defendant Thomas was even personally involved in arranging \nthe inspection trip that was a complete waste of time. See Doc. 1, Complaint, Exhibit D. \nThe Foundation’s injury stems from the Defendants’  failure to follow applicable laws \ngoverning public access to the voter registration list. Defendants’  argument  that  neither  is \nresponsible for enforcing the NVRA misses the point: their failure to  produce the list under \n52 U.S.C. § 20507, or provide access to it under 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) is the violation and was \nalleged as such by the Foundation.  Further, their Division has responsibility for ensuring  that \nsuch  productions are made in  accordance with state and federal law. They  are  responsible \nfor  the  actions  of  their  Divisions,  as  well  as  for  their  own  failures  to  handle  the \nFoundation’s requests properly and in accordance with federal law. \n \n \n  8 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 13    Filed: 10/19/20    Page 9 of 10 \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Foundation respectfully requests that the Court deny \nDefendants’ joint motion to dismiss. \nDated: October 19, 2020 \n \nFor the Plaintiff, Public Interest Legal Foundation: \n \nA.

(Doc. 1.) The Foundation respectfully submits that there are no issues of material fact \ngenuinely in dispute and the Foundation is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \nIntroduction \n \nIn the National Voter Registration Act (“NVRA”), Congress conferred upon the public a \nlegal right to inspect and copy state voter list maintenance records. Over a year and a half ago, \nthe Foundation sought, pursuant to the NVRA, to inspect (or if it was easier, receive) a record in \nthe Defendants’ possession concerning Illinois’s activities conducted to keep Illinois’s official \nvoter list accurate and current. The Foundation sought what is perhaps the most fundamental \nexample of such a record—the list of eligible voters itself with affiliated data, or as it is known in \nIllinois, the centralized statewide voter registration list (hereafter, the “Voter File”). The NVRA \nmakes the Voter File a public record. Yet Defendants have failed to provide the Foundation with \naccess to the Voter File.   \nThe Foundation’s right to receive the Voter File is not a close call. A recent decision \nsquarely confronting the identical question by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois supports the Foundation’s position. It is undisputed that Illinois conducts various voter \nlist maintenance activities, including creating new voter registration records, updating data for \nexisting registrations (e.g., address, surname), and cancelling voter registration records. Each \nactivity is conducted to keep Illinois’s official list of eligible voters accurate and current. Each of \nthese activities is also collectively reflected in the Voter File. Simply put, the Voter File is the \nculmination and end product of the implementation of Illinois’s voter list maintenance activities \nand contains critical list maintenance data. The Voter File contains registrant records and reflects \n1 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 9 of 32 \nactions taken that Illinois uses to track, monitor, and determine who belongs on the official list of \neligible voters. As such, the Voter File plainly concerns Illinois’s voter list maintenance \nprograms.  \nIllinois law prohibiting disclosure to the Foundation does not and cannot change the \nresult here because federal law is superior to any conflicting state law under the Constitution’s \nSupremacy Clause.  \nCongress made all voter list maintenance records subject to public inspection precisely so \nthat election administration is transparent. That cannot happen in Illinois because Defendants are \nconcealing list maintenance records from public inspection. Defendants cannot overcome the \nplain and unambiguous language of the NVRA or its preemptive effect. Judgment should \ntherefore enter that Defendants are in violation of the NVRA and must provide the Foundation \nwith access to the Voter File. \nUndisputed Material Facts \n1.  Section 8(i)(1) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (“NVRA”) \nprovides,  \nEach State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall make available for public \ninspection and, where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all records \nconcerning  the  implementation  of  programs  and  activities  conducted  for  the \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters, \nexcept to the extent that such records relate to a declination to register to vote or to \nthe identity of a voter registration agency through which any particular voter is \nregistered. \n \n52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) (hereafter, the “Public Disclosure Provision”). \n \n2.  10 ILCS 5/1A-25 sets forth, “The centralized statewide voter registration list \nrequired by Title III, Subtitle A, Section 303 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 shall be \ncreated and maintained by the State Board of Elections as provided in this Section.” See also \n2 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 10 of 32 \nDefendant Sandvoss’ Response to Plaintiff’s First Request for Admission, attached herein as \nExhibit A, at Response to Request for Admission No. 4; Doc. 1 at ¶ 34, Doc. 8 at ¶ 34; \nDeposition of Cheryl Hobson, attached herein as Exhibit B, at 7:22-9:2.  \n3.  The centralized statewide voter registration list is “generally referred to as the \nstatewide registration database. The information is compiled from individual registration \ndatabases of each individual election authority across the state.”  Deposition of Kyle Thomas as a \nRepresentative of the Illinois State Board of Elections, attached herein as Exhibit C, at 10:22-\n11:5, 38:2-6.1 \n4.  The Voter File is generated from the Database and is the official list of eligible \nvoters at the time it is generated. See Exhibit B at 57:1-20. Exhibit C at 29:22-30:12.  \n5.  Illinois permits only certain entities to obtain the Voter File. 10 ILCS 5/1A-25; \nsee also Exhibit B at 25:3-19. \n6.  The Public Interest Legal Foundation, Inc., (the “Foundation”) is a non-partisan, \npublic interest organization incorporated and based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Foundation \nseeks to promote the integrity of elections nationwide through research, education, remedial \nprograms, and litigation. The Foundation regularly utilizes the NVRA’s Public Disclosure \nProvision and state and federal open records laws that require government records be made \navailable to the public. Using records and data compiled through these open records laws, the \nFoundation analyzes the programs and activities of state and local election officials in order to \ndetermine whether lawful efforts are being made to keep voter rolls current and accurate. The \nFoundation also uses records and data to produce and disseminate reports, articles, blog and \n \n1  Throughout this Motion, the term “Database” refers to Illinois’s centralized statewide voter \nregistration list as it exists in database form and the term “Voter File” refers to the disclosure of a \ncopy centralized statewide voter registration list as contemplated by 10 ILCS 5/1A-25. \n3 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 11 of 32 \nsocial media posts, and newsletters in order to advance the public education aspect of its \norganizational mission. See Doc. 1.  \n7.  On October 16, 2019, the Foundation sent a letter by certified mail and email to \nthe Executive Director of the Illinois State Board of Elections requesting an electronic copy of \nIllinois’s statewide voter registration list pursuant to the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision. \nDoc. 1 at ¶ 18, Doc. 8 at ¶ 18. The Letter was filed in this case as Docket Entry 1-4 (hereafter, \nthe “Request Letter”).  \n8.  The Foundation’s Request letter acknowledged that 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) appears \nto prohibit the Foundation from receiving the Voter File and limited the Foundation to only view \ncertain data at the State Board of Elections’ office. Doc. 1 at ¶ 19, Doc. 8 at ¶ 19; Doc. 1-4 at 1. \n9.  The Foundation’s Request Letter also notified the Secretary that Illinois law \nviolates the NVRA because it prohibits disclosure of the Voter File. Doc. 1 at ¶ 20, Doc. 8 at ¶ \n20; Doc. 1-4 at 1. \n10.  On October 29, 2019, the Foundation received a letter from the State Board of \nElection’s General Counsel. Doc. 1 at ¶ 21, Doc. 8 at ¶ 21. The Letter was filed in this case as \nDocket Entry 1-5. \n11.  The General Counsel’s Letter explained, in part,  \nWe have received your letter dated October 16, 2019, alleging a violation of 52 \nUSC § 20507(i) by the State of Illinois based upon an allegation that “Illinois’ \ndisclosure and duplication limitations violate the text and intent of Section 8 of the \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA).” \n \nYour organization is authorized to participate in the “public inspection” (52 U.S.C. \n§ 20507(i)(1)) of Illinois voter registration information. As you correctly note in \nyour  letter,  Illinois  law  provides  that  “any  person  may  view  the  centralized \nstatewide voter registration list on a computer screen at the Springfield office of the \nState Board of Elections, during normal business hours other than during the 27 \ndays before an election.” 10ILCS 5/4-8; see also 10 ILCS 5-7, 6-35. \n \n4 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 12 of 32 \nDoc. 1 at ¶ 21, Doc. 8 at ¶ 21, Doc. 1-5.  \n \n12.  On November 14, 2019, the Foundation sent a letter to Mr. Menzel via email, \nacknowledging his response and advising him that the “NVRA requires not only inspection of \nvoter list maintenance records, but also reproduction” of them. The Foundation further advised \nthat “Illinois law appears to conflict with this requirement because it provides that we ‘may not \nprint, duplicate, transmit, or alter the list.’ 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4).” Doc. 1 at ¶ 22, Doc. 8 at ¶ 22. \nThe Letter was filed in this case as Docket Entry 1-6. \n13.  On January 31, 2020, counsel for the Foundation went to the State Board of \nElection’s office in Springfield, Illinois to inspect the centralized statewide voter registration list. \nDoc. 1 at ¶ 26, Doc. 8 at ¶ 26; Exhibit B at 38:13-39:17. \n14.  It is undisputed that “[t]he actual centralized statewide voter registration list \ncannot be retrieved and viewed by the public on a computer screen at the Springfield office of \nthe [Illinois State Board of Elections].” Exhibit A at Response to Request for Admission No. 28; \nSee also Exhibit B at 35:21-36:16, 38:13-39:17. \n15.  On February 21, 2020, the Foundation sent a statutory Notice Letter to \nDefendants that notified them that Defendants’ refusal to produce or allow the photocopying of \nany of the requested documents was a violation of the NVRA, and that the violation needed to be \ncorrected within 20 days of receipt of the notice or else a lawsuit could be filed. Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 31, \n41, Doc. 8 at ¶¶ 31, 41. The Letter was filed in this case as Docket Entry 1-9. \n16.  The Foundation did not receive a response to its Notice Letter. Doc. 1 at ¶ 32, \nDoc. 8 at ¶ 32. \n17.  Defendants have not allowed the Foundation to view the Voter File. Exhibit B at \nExhibit B at 35:21-36:16, 38:13-39:17, 40:1-5; Exhibit C at 9:22-10:17, 21:21-24, 40:19-41:5. \n5 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 13 of 32 \n18.  Defendants have not provided the Foundation with a copy of the Voter File. \nExhibit B at 40:6-9; Exhibit C at 21:21-24.  \n19.  The following voter record information is maintained in the Database for each \nregistered voter: \na.  Name. Exhibit B at 50:9-11. \nb.  Residential address. Exhibit B at 50:12-14. \nc.  Mailing address. Exhibit B at 50:15-17. \nd.  Complete date of birth. Exhibit B at 50:18-19. \ne.  Voter status. Exhibit B at 51:12-14. \nf.  Date of registration. Exhibit B at 50:20-22. \ng.  Date of updates or changes to voter record information. Exhibit B at 51:9-11. \nh.  Voter participation history. Exhibit B at 50:23-51:1. \nSee also Deposition of Kyle Thomas, attached herein as Exhibit D, at 26:15-28:19; Exhibit C at \n11:23-12:6.  \n20.  Election officials in Illinois, including Defendants, use the centralized statewide \nvoter registration list to conduct voter list maintenance. Exhibit B at 17:5-20:6; 20:18-21:22; \n56:20-24; Exhibit C at 22:13-23:12, 26:16-28:9, 31:7-32:5. \n21.

Documenting that the registrant has moved to a new address, Exhibit A at \nResponse to Request for Admission No. 14; \nh.  Documenting that the registrant has requested to be removed from the \nregistration list, Exhibit A at Response to Request for Admission No. 16; \ni.  Documenting that an address confirmation card was sent to a registrant’s \naddress, Exhibit A at Response to Request for Admission No. 18; \nj.  Documenting that the registrant was reported to be deceased, Exhibit A at \nResponse to Request for Admission No. 19. \n \nSee also, Exhibit D at 20:21-21:5; 23:11-17; Exhibit C at 22:13-23:12; 24:1-22, 31:7-32:5. \n22.  The centralized statewide voter registration list contains registration information \nmaintained by the local election officials. Exhibit A at Response to Request for Admission No. \n22. See also Exhibit C at 31:7-32:5. \nArgument \nThis is a case for declaratory and injunctive relief under the National Voter Registration \nAct of 1993 (“NVRA”), 52 U.S.C. §§ 20501-20511. With two irrelevant exceptions, section \n20507(i)(1) of the NVRA is similar to a federal freedom of information law, albeit more \npowerful than FOIA, requiring election administration officials to “make available for public \ninspection and, where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all records concerning the \nimplementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy \nand currency of official lists of eligible voters[.]” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) (hereafter, the “Public \nDisclosure Provision”).2  \nA recent decision from the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois, as well as the full weight of other authority, supports the Foundation’s Motion. There, \n \n2 “[P]rograms and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of \nofficial lists of eligible voters” are referred to as “voter list maintenance” programs or activities. \n7 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 15 of 32 \nthe court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claim that the Illinois State Board of \nElections violated the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i), by failing to \n“produce electronic voter registration data for Illinois.” Ill. Conservative Union v. Illinois, No. 20 \nC 5542, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102543, at *1-2 (N.D. Ill. June 1, 2021). Relevant to the \nFoundation’s Motion, “Defendants argue[d] that the NVRA only requires disclosure of records \nrelated to how the State maintains its eligible voter list and not the voter lists themselves, \npointing out that Section 8(i) uses language concerning ‘the implementation of programs and \nactivities.’” Id. at *13 (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1)). The court stated that defendants \n“fail[ed] to provide any legal authority for their preferred construction of the statutory language,” \nid. at *13, and recognized that “the courts that have addressed the question have uniformly \nreached the conclusion that the NVRA’s reference to ‘records’ in Section 8(i) includes voter list \ndata,” id. at *14 (collecting cases). Consequently, the court “accept[ed] that Plaintiffs’ request \nseeks voter registration information that falls within Section 8(i)’s disclosure provision.” Id. at \n*15. \nThe Ill. Conservative Union court explained that “[b]ecause Congress passed the NVRA \npursuant to the Elections Clause, the Elections Clause, not the Supremacy Clause, provides the \nproper starting point for the preemption analysis” and “[t]he traditional presumption against \npreemption does not apply in Elections Clause cases.” Id. at *16 (citing Arizona v. Inter Tribal \nCouncil of Ariz., Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 14 (2013)). The court concluded, “Plaintiffs have plausibly \nalleged that [Illinois’s] prohibition on photocopying conflicts with Section 8(i) and frustrates the \nNVRA’s purpose of providing voter information to the public to help ensure the accuracy and \ncurrency of voter registration rolls.” Id. at *19.   \n8 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 16 of 32 \nSimilarly, the Foundation requested and was denied access to Illinois’s Voter File. For \nthe reasons that follow, judgment should enter for the Foundation.  \nI.  Summary Judgment Standard \n \n“‘Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings and submissions in the record \nindicate the absence of any genuine issues of material fact, such that the moving party is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.’” Berrey v. Travelers Indem. Co. of Am., 917 F. Supp. 2d 873, \n877 (C.D. Ill. 2013) (quoting Mercatus Group, LLC v. Lake Forest Hospital, 641 F.3d 834, 839 \n(7th Cir. 2011)). \nII.  The Foundation is Entitled to Summary Judgment. \n \nA.  The Foundation Requested the Voter File and Defendants Denied the \nFoundation’s Request.  \n \nIt is undisputed that the prior to the filing of this litigation, the Foundation requested from \nDefendants an electronic copy of Illinois’s statewide voter registration list (“Voter File”) \npursuant to the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision. Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) ¶ 7. It \nis undisputed that the Voter File is used for and reflects list maintenance activities. UMF ¶¶ 20-\n22. It is also undisputed that Defendants have not provided the Foundation with the Voter File. \nUMF ¶¶ 17-18. See Ill. Conservative Union, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102543, at *10 (holding that \ndefendants’ failure to provide “meaningful access to voter records in violation of the \nNVRA…constitutes a sufficiently particularized injury in fact for standing purposes.”) These \nfacts are not genuinely in dispute. \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 17 of 32 \nB.  Defendants’ Denial of Access to the Voter File Violates the NVRA. \n \n1.  The Voter File Is Subject to Public Disclosure Under the Plain and \nUnambiguous Terms of the NVRA. \n \nOn its face, the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision is a broad mandate, requiring public \ndisclosure of “all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted \nfor the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters[.]” 52 \nU.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) (emphasis added). The Voter File—a record that captures and reflects the \nmost current maintenance of all voter record information—falls squarely within the scope of this \ndisclosure command. \n“The starting point in statutory interpretation is the language [of the statute] itself.” \nArdestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 135 (1991) (citations and quotations omitted). The Supreme \nCourt instructs that “courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and \nmeans in a statute what it says there.” Conn. Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 \n(1992). “When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: \njudicial inquiry is complete.” Id. at 254 (citations and quotations omitted). The text of the Public \nDisclosure Provision is unambiguous: “Each state … shall make available for public inspection \n... all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters.” 52 U.S.C. § \n20507(i)(1) (emphasis added). All records concerning activities conducted by Illinois to make \nvoter registration information current and accurate are subject to public disclosure, period. The \nrecords the Foundation is seeking are records subject to inspection and disclosure by the plain \ntext of the statute.  \n \n \n10 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 18 of 32 \na.  The Voter File is a “Record.” \nDefendants cannot genuinely dispute that the Voter File is a “record” under the NVRA’s \nPublic Disclosure Provision. Because the NVRA does not define “record,” the court considers \nthe common and ordinary meaning of the term. See Project Vote, Inc. v. Kemp, 208 F. Supp. 3d \n1320, 1335 (N.D. Ga. 2016) (interpreting meaning of “record” in NVRA). The Merriam-Webster \nDictionary defines record as “a body of known or recorded facts about something or someone” \nand “a collection of related items of information (as in a database) treated as a unit.”3 The Voter \nFile is both a “body of known [and] recorded facts” about each eligible voter and “a collection of \nrelated items of information” about each eligible voter “treated as a unit.” The Voter File is \ntherefore plainly a “record” under the plain meaning of the term. \nIt makes no difference that the Voter File is generated and distributed in an electronic \nformat because the NVRA requires disclosure of “all records,” not just physical records. 52 \nU.S.C. § 20507(i)(1). As the Northern District of Georgia prudently recognized, “Interpreting \n‘records’ to exclude information contained within electronic databases … would allow States to \ncircumvent their NVRA disclosure obligations simply by choosing to store information in a \nparticular manner. Given the ubiquity and ease of electronic storage, this would effectively \nrender Section 8(i) a nullity.” Project Vote, Inc., 208 F. Supp. 3d at 1336. \nb.  The Voter File “Concern[s]” the “Implementation of Programs and \nActivities Conducted for the Purpose of Ensuring the Accuracy and \nCurrency of Official Lists of Eligible Voters[.]” \n \nDefendants acknowledge that elections use the centralized statewide voter registration list \nto conduct voter list maintenance. UMF ¶ 20. According to Defendant Thomas, local election \nofficials use the centralized statewide voter list for the following purposes: \n \n3 https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/record (last accessed July 15, 2021). \n11 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 19 of 32 \n[The database is] where they’re notified of potential duplicates. In some cases, \nthey’re notified of potential deceased  records,  matches for potential deceased. \nThey’re notified of potential transfers from one jurisdiction to another. And they’re \nnotified of military and overseas, the MOVE Act applications. It’s where they get a \nnotification and they can interact with the database directly through the web portal. \n \nExhibit D at 20:21-21:5. Further, according to Defendant Thomas, State election officials use the \nDatabase for various activities to maintain the list of registered voters.  \nWe receive a monthly file from [the Department of Health] for deceased individuals \nand the system makes potential matches and displays those potential matches to the \nelection authorities for action or not. The -- We also have interaction with -- for \nvalidation of records with the Secretary of State’s Office as well as the Social \nSecurity Administration where jurisdictions are notified of potential discrepancies \nin records. We have – Let’s see. And then we’re also a member of the Electronic \nRegistration Information Center, where information is provided to ERIC and then \nthey provide reports back, and information on those reports are provided to the \nelection authorities through the web portal. \n \nExhibit D at 21:18-22:7. \n \nInterpreting the plain meaning of the NVRA’s terms, the Eastern District of Virginia \nconcluded that “a program or activity covered by the Public Disclosure Provision is one \nconducted to ensure that the state is keeping a ‘most recent’ and errorless account of which \npersons are qualified or entitled to vote within the state.” Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc. v. \nLong, 752 F. Supp. 2d 697, 706 (E.D. Va. 2010); see also True the Vote, 43 F. Supp. 3d at 719-\n20 (“A list of voters is ‘accurate’ if it is ‘free from error or defect’ and it is ‘current’ if it is ‘most \nrecent.’”) (Citations omitted).  \nThe remaining question for the Court is whether the Voter File “concern[s]” Illinois’s \nvoter list maintenance programs. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1). The common and ordinary meaning of \nthe word “concern” is “to relate to.” Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/concerns?src=search-dict-hed (last accessed July 15, 2021). The Voter \nFile plainly relates to Illinois’ voter list maintenance programs in at least two ways. \n12 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 20 of 32 \ni.  The Voter File Reflects and Is the End-Product of Illinois’s \nVoter List Maintenance Activities. \n \nThe Voter File contains voter record information for each registered voter who is eligible \nto vote in Illinois as of the date the file is generated. UMF ¶ 4. The Voter File is the culmination \nand end product of the implementation of Illinois’s voter list maintenance activities. The Voter \nFile squarely “concerns” Illinois’ voter list maintenance activities and therefore falls within the \nscope of the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision. \n  The following hypothetical—proposed to Defendant Hobson in deposition—reinforces \nthis conclusion: \n13· · · · · · ·Okay.· Let's say that today your office \n14· ·generated a centralized statewide voter registration \n15· ·list for an entity and on that file is a person named \n16· ·Jane Doe.· And it says -- according to that list that’s \n17· ·been generated, it states that she’s registered at 1234 \n18· ·Main Street.· You following me so far? \n19· · · · A.· ·I got you so far. \n20· · · · Q.· ·Okay.· A week later, Jane Doe gets married and \n21· ·she decides to legally change her name and move.· Jane \n22· ·Doe then submits a new voter registration application \n23· ·under her new name of Smith, using her new address of \n24· ·1234 State Street.· Is it correct that that database \n·1· ·would then be used -- The database would then be updated \n·2· ·with her new last name and new address, correct? \n·3· · · · A.· ·Correct. \n13 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 21 of 32 \n·4· · · · Q.· ·Then, let’s say, the next week you again \n·5· ·access the database to generate the centralized \n·6· ·statewide voter registration list. Would the new copy \n·7· ·of the list that you just generated now list her new \n·8· ·last name and her new address? \n·9· · · · A.· ·That is correct. \n10· · · · Q.· ·So is it correct to say that when changes and \n11· ·updates are made to an individual voter registration \n12· ·record, like with our hypothetical Jane Doe, those \n13· ·updates are reflected on the centralized statewide \n14· ·voting registration list the next time it is generated? \n15· · · · A.· ·That is correct. \nExhibit B at 58:13-59:15. The Voter File reflects—and therefore “concern[s]” and “relates to”—\nIllinois’ activities conducted to keep each eligible voter’s official information current and \naccurate—here, a change to the voter’s name and address. Many analogous list maintenance data \npoints also exist in the Voter File–registration addresses, dates of last vote, and more. UMF ¶ 19. \nThere is no credible argument to the contrary. \nii.  The Voter File Is a Compilation of Voter Registration \nRecords, Which Illinois Uses to Determine Eligibility to \nVote. \n \nThe Voter File is generated from the Database and is the official list of eligible voters at \nthe time it is generated. UMF ¶ 4. Illinois law requires that “[t]he registration information \nmaintained by each election authority shall be synchronized with that authority’s information on \nthe statewide list at least once every 24 hours.” 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4). When generated, then, the \n14 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 22 of 32 \nVoter File is simply a compilation of the official and most recent voter registration records of all \neligible registrants. \nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. Lamone, 399 F. Supp. 3d 425 (D. Md. 2019) resolved the same \nquestion at issue here. In Judicial Watch, the court granted summary judgment, holding a list of \nMaryland’s registered voters is a “record” covered by the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision. \nPlaintiffs sought production of the voter registration list for Montgomery County, Maryland. \nJudicial Watch, 399 F. Supp. 3d at 434-445. The court explained, \nIn Maryland, State and local officials rely on voter registrations to register new \nvoters  and  to  remove  ineligible  voters,  thereby  “‘ensuring  the  accuracy  and \ncurrency of official lists of eligible voters.’” [Project Vote / Voting for Am., Inc. v. \nLong, 682 F.3d 331, 335 (4th Cir. 2012)] (internal citation omitted). And, the voter \nregistrations are clearly records that concern the implementation of the program \nand activity of maintaining accurate and current eligible voter lists. After all, they \ncontain the information on which Maryland election officials rely to monitor, track, \nand determine voter eligibility. \n \nJudicial Watch, 399 F. Supp. 3d at 439. Because “a voter list is simply a pared down compilation \nof voter registrations,” id. at 440, the court reasoned, it is likewise a “record” covered by the \nNVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision, id. at 440-442.4 \n  The Voter File is likewise a “compilation of voter registrations.” Id. at 440. Indeed, the \ninformation contained in the Voter File is pulled directly from the official statewide database, \nUMF ¶ 4, the information that election officials endeavor to keep current and “on \nwhich…election officials rely to monitor, track, and determine voter eligibility.” Judicial Watch, \n399 F. Supp. 3d at 439. The Voter File is likewise a record covered by the NVRA.  \n \n4 The court ultimately concluded that the NVRA also requires disclosure of birthdate \ninformation. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Lamone, 455 F. Supp. 3d 209 (D. Md. 2020). \n15 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 23 of 32 \n  True the Vote v. Hosemann, 43 F. Supp. 3d 693 (S.D. Miss. 2014) also supports the \nFoundation. In that case, the plaintiff sought a “‘a complete list of all Mississippi voters [in] all \nstatus categories’” Id. at 723. The court observed, \nMississippi has an electronic election recordkeeping system, SEMS, that contains \nits Voter Roll information. The Voter Roll is created from data in SEMS and is \nmaintained by the State. Counties receive voter registration applications from \nindividual registrants and must scan the applications and other pertinent registration \ndocumentation into SEMS. … \n \nThe Court likewise concludes that the Voter Roll is a “record” and is the “official \nlist[] of eligible voters” under the NVRA Public Disclosure Provision. The process \nof compiling, maintaining, and reviewing the voter roll is a program or activity \nperformed by Mississippi election officials that ensures the official roll is properly \nmaintained to be accurate and current. \n \nId.  \n  The same is true here. Illinois has a centralized database of records. UMF ¶¶ 2-3. The \nVoter File is created from that database. UMF ¶ 4. The Voter File contains various voter record \ninformation stored in the statewide database for each eligible registrant, including name and \naddress, Exhibit C at 11:23-12:6, and is a list of all eligible voters in Illinois at the time it is \ngenerated. UMF ¶ 4. As in Mississippi, “[t]he process of compiling, maintaining, and reviewing” \nthe Voter File is an activity performed by Illinois election officials “that ensures the official roll \nis properly maintained to be accurate and current.” True the Vote, 43 F. Supp. 3d at 723. The \nVoter File is a “record” of that activity and thus covered by the NVRA. \n2.  The Vast Majority of States Comply with the NVRA.  \n \nIllinois is one of very few states that conceals its Voter File from the public, in \ncontravention of the NVRA’s plain text.

The Foundation has filed a motion for summary judgment in the case against Maine, \nwhich is currently pending. Public Interest Legal Foundation v. Bellows, Case No. 1:20-cv-\n00061 (D. Me.). The Foundation is unaware of any Court that has upheld a restriction like \nIllinois’s on voter list maintenance data.5 \n3.  Disclosure of the Voter File is Consistent with Congress’s Intent. \n \nTo find that the Voter File is not within the scope of the NVRA is inconsistent with the \nexplicit intent of Congress. The NVRA was enacted for four purposes, including “to protect the \nintegrity of the electoral process” and “to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls \nare maintained.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(3)-(4). The NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision reflects \n \n5 Several courts have struck as unconstitutional voter-roll-access laws that discriminate against \ncertain persons and entities. See, e.g., Providence Journal Co. v. Farmer, No. 85-0602B, 1986 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 31325, at *9, *11 (D.R.I. July 25, 1986) (“Rhode Island General Law section \n17-6-5 abridges the right of access to public records by excluding the public from total access to \nthe magnetic tape of the central voter registry. … [T]he statute is a denial of First and Fourteenth \nAmendment protections and unconstitutional.”); Donrey Media Grp. v. Ikeda, 959 F. Supp. \n1280, 1287 (D. Haw. 1996) (“The statute, as drafted, provides dangerous precedent by allowing \nthe state government and local municipalities to control the type of access to voter registration \nrecords that will be permitted to the press while permitting record access to political parties and \ncertain other organizations. This clearly is an intolerable infringement upon the public’s right to \nknow and denies a means of public access to important information relative to the integrity and \nhonesty of the elections process.”); Libertarian Party of Ind. v. Marion Cty. Bd. of Voter \nRegistration, 778 F. Supp. 1458, 1465 (S.D. Ind. 1991) (“In light of the court’s ruling that IC 3-\n7-7-10, as applied by the Voter Registration Board to the plaintiffs in this case, violates the \nplaintiffs’ equal protection rights, the county Defendants are hereby ordered to provide copies of \nRegistration Lists to the plaintiff New Alliance and Libertarian parties in the same forms and \nmanners and on the same terms as such lists are distributed to major political parties[.]”). \n18 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 26 of 32 \nCongressional intent by allowing the public to monitor the activities of government as they \nconcern the right to vote: \n[The NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision is] available to any member of the \npublic … and convey[s] Congress’s intention that the public should be monitoring \nthe state of the voter rolls and the adequacy of election officials’ list maintenance \nprograms. [52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)]. Accordingly, election officials must provide \nfull public access to all records related to their list maintenance activities, \nincluding their voter rolls. Id. This mandatory public inspection right is designed \nto preserve the right to vote and ensure that election officials are complying with \nthe NVRA. Project Vote v. Long, 682 F.3d. 331, 335 (4th Cir. 2012). \n \nBellitto v. Snipes, No. 16-cv-61474, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103617, at *12-13 (S.D. Fla. Mar. \n30, 2018) (emphasis added). Indeed, Congress made all list maintenance records subject to \npublic inspection precisely so that the public can enjoy a transparent election process and assess \ncompliance with federal laws. Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, \n364 (5th Cir. 1999) (private-right-of action meant to “encourage enforcement by so-called \n‘private attorneys general’” (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 157 (1997)).  \nC.  Illinois Law Is Preempted and Superseded by the NVRA. \n \nIllinois’s exemptions conflict with federal law. “[T]he disclosure of any portion of the \ncentralized statewide voter registration list to any person or entity other than to a State or local \npolitical committee and other than to a governmental entity for a governmental purpose is \nspecifically prohibited…” 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1A-25. No other individual and entity may \ninspect, purchase, or otherwise receive the Voter File. See id.; UMF ¶ 5. In other words, this \npurportedly confidential information can nevertheless be disclosed to State or local political \ncommittees who then use the information to contact—or in the eyes of some, bother—the \nregistrant directly. \nIllinois law is preempted, superseded and unenforceable under Article VI, Clause 2 of the \nUnited States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), Article I, Section 4, Clause I of the United \n19 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 27 of 32 \nStates Constitution (the Elections Clause), and the Supreme Court’s decision in Arizona v. Inter \nTribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1. In Inter Tribal, the Supreme Court held in unambiguous \nterms that the NVRA is superior to any conflicting state laws. In such situations, “the state law, \n‘so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.’” Inter Tribal, 570 U.S. at 9 (quoting Ex \nparte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 384 (1880)). According to the Court: \nWhen Congress legislates with respect to the “Times, Places and Manner” of \nholding congressional elections, it necessarily displaces some element of a pre-\nexisting legal regime erected by the States. Because the power the Elections Clause \nconfers is none other than the power to pre-empt, the reasonable assumption is that \nthe statutory text accurately communicates the scope of Congress’s pre-emptive \nintent…. In sum, there is no compelling reason not to read Elections Clause \nlegislation simply to mean what it says. \n \nId. at 14-15. \nIn fact, the Seventh Circuit has already answered in the affirmative the question of \nwhether the NVRA is superior to conflicting Illinois law. ACORN v. Edgar, 56 F.3d 791, 795 \n(7th Cir. 1995). In ACORN, Illinois argued that “[t]he ‘motor voter’ law…imposes without the \nstate’s consent new federal responsibilities that will require changes in state laws governing \nvoter registration; imposes heavy unreimbursed costs on the state; and makes it more difficult for \nthe state to fight vote fraud.” Id. at 793. The Seventh Circuit explained, \nA state might already have had exactly the same provisions in its registration law \n(a law, let us say, equally applicable to state and federal elections) as are found in \nthe “motor voter” law, and then that law would not alter state law. But if, as is true \nin Illinois, the state law regulating registration for federal elections differs from the \n“motor voter” law, the latter does alter state law. This seems, however, to be exactly \nwhat is contemplated by Article I section 4. \n \nACORN, 56 F.3d at 795. In conclusion, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s \nfinding “that all provisions of Illinois law that conflict with the [NVRA] are invalid.” Id. \nat 797.  \n20 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 28 of 32 \nThe relevant statutory text of the NVRA says that states must make available for \ninspection “all records” of their voter list maintenance programs.6 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1). That \nrequirement says plainly what it says —“all records.” There are no safe harbors granted to \nrecords exempted or made confidential under state law, particularly when the same records are \nreadily made available to people who expressly aim to contact those registrants. Under Inter \nTribal and ACORN, Illinois law is therefore invalid and unenforceable. See also Project \nVote/Voting for Am., Inc. v. Long, 813 F.Supp.2d 738, 743 (E.D. Va. 2011) (“[T]o the extent that \nany Virginia law, rule, or regulation forecloses disclosure of completed voter registration \napplications with the voters’ SSNs redacted, the court FINDS that it is preempted by the \nNVRA.”). \nJudicial Watch is again instructive. The court in Judicial Watch also held that the \nNVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision preempts a Maryland law that required an applicant \nrequesting a voter registration list to be a Maryland registered voter. Judicial Watch, 399 F. \nSupp. 3d at 443- 445. After reviewing various types of preemption, the court found that limiting \naccess to the voter registration lists to Maryland registrants “is an obstacle to the accomplishment \nof the NVRA’s purposes,”id. at 445—namely, “protect[ing] the integrity of the electoral \nprocess,” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(3); and “ensur[ing] that accurate and current voter registration \nrolls are maintained.” 52 U.S.C. § 20501(b)(4). The court specifically noted that “Section 8(i) of \nthe NVRA provides for the disclosure of voter registrations in order to ‘assist the identification \nof both error and fraud in the preparation and maintenance of voter rolls.’” Judicial Watch, 399 \nF. Supp. 3d at 445 (quoting Project Vote / Voting for Am., Inc. v. Long, 682 F.3d 331, 339 (4th \nCir. 2012)). By limiting that disclosure to Maryland voters, Maryland law, “exclude[ed] \n \n6 Congress explicitly exempted only two specific types of records. See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1). \n21 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 29 of 32 \norganizations and citizens of other states from identifying error and fraud,” contrary to the \nNVRA’s purposes. Id. The court accordingly held, “It follows that the State law is preempted in \nso far as it allows only Maryland registered voters to access voter registration lists.” Judicial \nWatch, 399 F. Supp. 3d at 445. \n  Illinois law likewise limits disclosure of its eligible voter list—the Voter File—to \ncertain preferred entities. See 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1A-25. It is therefore subject to (1) \nordinary conflict preemption doctrine because “compliance with both federal and state \nregulations is a physical impossibility,” Gade v. Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 98 \n(1992) (citations omitted), or (2) as in Judicial Watch, obstacle preemption, because Illinois law \n“stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of \nCongress.’” 399 F. Supp. 3d at 444 (quoting Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U.S. 280, 287 \n(1995).) Under either, doctrine, Illinois law is preempted and cannot be applied to prevent \ndisclosure to the Foundation. \n   \n22 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 22    Filed: 07/15/21    Page 30 of 32 \nConclusion \n \nThe NVRA means what it says—“all records” concerning voter list maintenance are \nsubject to public inspection and reproduction. For the reasons explained herein, that broad \nmandate includes Illinois’s Voter File. Because there are no material facts genuinely in dispute, \nthe Foundation is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \n \n \nDated: July 15, 2021. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  /s/ Kaylan L.

MYERSCOUGH, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore the Court are Plaintiff Public Interest Legal \nFoundation’s (the Foundation) Motion for Summary Judgment (d/e \n22), and Defendants Illinois State Board of Elections’ (the Board), \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Bernadette Matthews, as the current Acting \nExecutive Director of the Illinois State Board of Elections, is automatically substituted for \nformer Executive Director Steve Sandvoss. \nPage 1 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 2 of 27 \nExecutive Director Bernadette Matthews’, Director Kyle Thomas’, \nand Deputy Director Cheryl Hobsons’ (collectively, the Defendants) \nMotion for Summary Judgment (d/e 29).  On the undisputed \nmaterial facts, the Foundation has shown that Illinois Code Chapter \n10 Section5/1A-25 is preempted by the National Voter Registration \nAct, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1).  As a result, the Foundation has shown \nthat it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the single Count \nalleged in the Foundation’s Complaint (d/e 1).  Therefore, the \nFoundation’s Motion for Summary Judgment (d/e 22) is GRANTED \nand Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (d/e 29) is \nDENIED.  Additionally, and for similar reasons, Defendants the \nBoard’s, Director Kyle Thomas’, and Deputy Director Cheryl \nHobson’s Motion to Dismiss (d/e 9) is DENIED. \nI.  Background \nA. Undisputed Material Facts \nThe Court draws the following facts from the parties’ Local \nRule 7.1(D)(1)(b) statements of undisputed material facts.  The \nCourt discusses any material factual disputes in its analysis.  \nImmaterial facts or factual disputes are omitted.  Any fact \nsubmitted by any party that was not supported by a citation to \nPage 2 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 3 of 27 \nevidence will not be considered by the Court.  See Civil LR \n7.1(D)(2)(b)(2).  In addition, if any response to a fact failed to \nsupport each allegedly disputed fact with evidentiary \ndocumentation, that fact is deemed admitted.  Id.   \nOn October 16, 2019, the Foundation sent a letter to then-\nExecutive Director of the Board Steve Sandvoss in which the \nFoundation requested an electronic copy of Illinois’s statewide voter \nregistration list, a list which is required by the Help America Vote \nAct of 2002, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 15301 et seq., and the \nmaintenance of which Illinois has delegated to the Board, see 10 \nILCS 5/1A-25.  The statewide voter registration list contains \ninformation compiled from individual voter registration databases of \nthe separate election authorities across Illinois.  The Board and its \nemployees are able to generate different reports from the statewide \nvoter registration list, one of which is a report of all eligible voters in \nIllinois.   \nOn October 29, 2019, the Foundation received a response \nfrom the Board’s General Counsel denying the Foundation’s \nrequest.  The denial letter stated that “Illinois law provides that ‘any \nperson may view the centralized statewide voter registration list on \nPage 3 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 4 of 27 \na computer screen at the Springfield office of the State Board of \nElections, during normal business hours other than during the 27 \ndays before an election.’ 10 ILCS 5/4-8; see also 10 ILCS 5-7, 6-35.”  \nPl.’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (PSUMF) (d/e 22) ¶¶ \n10–11.   \nOn January 31, 2020, a representative from the Foundation \ntraveled to the Board’s office in Springfield, Illinois to attempt to \nview the statewide voter registration list.  Once there, the \nrepresentative was given access to a program to search the list but \nwas not allowed to either view the list in full or print, duplicate, or \ndownload the list.  Instead, the representative was told that the \nstatewide voter registration list can only be “searched for a specific \nname or birthdate on the computer screen at the Springfield office \nbut there is not a search option available that will retrieve the \nstatewide voter registration list for viewing in its entirety.”  Def.’s \nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts (DSUMF) (d/e 30) ¶ 11.  \nThe Foundation was never allowed to view or copy the statewide \nvoter registration list in full.  The Foundation filed suit against \nDefendants on July 27, 2020, alleging that Defendants actions \nPage 4 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 5 of 27 \namount to a single count of violating the National Voter Registration \nAct.  \nB. Statutory background \nArticle III, Section 5 of the Illinois Constitution establishes a \nState Board of Elections tasked with supervising the administration \nof “the registration and election laws” in Illinois.  See also 10 ILCS \n5/1A-1.  Illinois Code Chapter 10 Section 5/1A-25 further provides \nthe governing law for the statewide voter registration list.  Relevant \nto this case, Section 5/1A-25 provides, \nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of voter \nregistration information, the disclosure of any portion of \nthe centralized statewide voter registration list to any \nperson or entity other than to a State or local political \ncommittee and other than to a governmental entity for a \ngovernmental purpose is specifically prohibited except as \nfollows: (1) subject to security measures adopted by the \nState Board of Elections . . . any person may view the list \non a computer screen at the Springfield office of the State \nBoard of Elections, during normal business hours other \nthan during the 27 days before an election, but the \nperson viewing the list under this exception may not \nprint, duplicate, transmit, or alter the list; or (2) as may \nbe required by an agreement the State Board of Elections \nhas entered into with a multi-state voter registration list \nmaintenance system. \n \nThe National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), in turn, mandates \ncertain records be kept by State election officials and be made \nPage 5 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 6 of 27 \npublic “to protect the integrity of the electoral process” and “to \nensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are \nmaintained.”  52 U.S.C. § 20501(b) (the Public Disclosure \nProvision).  Specifically, Public Disclosure Provision provides for the \npublic disclosure of voter registration activities. That section states, \nEach State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall \nmake available for public inspection and, where \navailable, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all records \nconcerning the implementation of programs and activities \nconducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and \ncurrency of official lists of eligible voters, except to the \nextent that such records relate to a declination to register \nto vote or to the identity of a voter registration agency \nthrough which any particular voter is registered. \n \n52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1). \nThe Foundation alleges that Section 5/1A-25 conflicts with the \nNVRA to the extent that Section 5/1A-25 preempted.  Defendants \ndisagree, arguing that the Public Disclosure Provision of the NVRA \ndoes not regulate voter registration lists, so there is no conflict \nbetween the two statutes.  Each party has moved for summary \njudgment on their arguments. \nII.  Legal Standard \nSummary judgment is proper if the movant shows that no \ngenuine dispute exists as to any material fact and that the movant \nPage 6 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 7 of 27 \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \nThe movant bears the initial responsibility of informing the Court of \nthe basis for the motion and identifying the evidence the movant \nbelieves demonstrates the absence of any genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  \n“[S]ummary judgment is the ‘put up or shut up’ moment in a \nlawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would \nconvince a trier of fact to accept its version of events.”  Johnson v. \nCambridge Indus., Inc., 325 F.3d 892, 901 (7th Cir. 2003).   \nOn that evidence, the Court must determine whether a \ngenuine dispute of material facts exists.  A genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact exists if a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of \nthe nonmoving party.  Carroll v. Lynch, 698 F.3d 561, 564 (7th Cir. \n2012).  When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court \nmust construe facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty and draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party's \nfavor.  Woodruff v. Mason, 542 F.3d 545, 550 (7th Cir. 2008).   \nThe above-stated standards for summary judgment remain \nunchanged when considering cross motions for summary judgment: \nthe Court must “construe all inferences in favor of the party against \nPage 7 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 8 of 27 \nwhom the motion under consideration is made.”  Metro. Life Ins. \nCo. v. Johnson, 297 F.3d 558, 561–62 (7th Cir. 2002).   \nIII.  Analysis \nA. The Board, Director Thomas, and Deputy Director Hobson \nare proper parties to this suit. \n \nDefendants argue that the Board, Director Thomas, and \nDeputy Director Hobson should be granted summary judgment \nbecause they are improper parties to this suit.  The Board argues \nthat it is an improper party under the doctrine of sovereign \nimmunity and Defendants Thomas and Hobson argue that they are \nimproper parties because neither is tasked with enforcing the \nNVRA.   \ni.  The Board are not entitled to sovereign immunity here. \nThe Board argues that it is not subject to the Court’s \njurisdiction in this case and should be awarded summary judgment \nbecause the Board cannot be sued as a state agency under the \nEleventh Amendment’s sovereign immunity protections.  Generally, \nthe Eleventh Amendment grants States and their agencies, such as \nthe Board, sovereign immunity from suit in federal courts.  \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98 \nPage 8 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 9 of 27 \n(1984); Kroll v. Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Illinois, 934 F.2d 904, \n907 (7th Cir. 1991) (“a state agency is the state for purposes of the \n[E]leventh [A]mendment”).  However, sovereign immunity will not \napply where States “unequivocally” consent to suit, see Sossamon v. \nTexas, 563 U.S. 277, 284 (2011), and where Congress has \nunequivocally abrogated individual States’ sovereign immunity by \nlaw through a valid exercise of Congressional authority, see \nSeminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55 (1996).   \nStates’ sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment \nalso does not apply “where there has been ‘a surrender of this \nimmunity in the plan of the Convention.’”  Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. \n706, 729–30 (1999) (quoting Principality of Monaco v. State of \nMississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 323–24 (1934)).  Under the plan of the \nConvention doctrine, the sovereign immunity afforded to States by \nthe Eleventh Amendment will cease where a “fundamental \npostulate[] implicit in the constitutional design” begins.  PennEast \nPipeline Co. v. New Jersey, 141 S.Ct. 2244, 2258 (2021).  “The \nEleventh Amendment confirmed, rather than established, sovereign \nimmunity as a constitutional principle; it follows that the scope of \nthe States' immunity from suit is demarcated not by the text of the \nPage 9 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 10 of 27 \nAmendment alone but by fundamental postulates implicit in the \nconstitutional design.”  Alden, 527 U.S., at 729–30.  In other words, \n“the government of the United States is invested with full and \ncomplete power to execute and carry out [the Constitution’s] \npurposes,” and when a state interferes with the exercise of such \npower, the state may not assert sovereign immunity from suit in \nfederal court.  PennEast, 141 S.Ct. at 2259; Garcia v. San Antonio \nMetro Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 549 (1985) (Recognizing that \nstates retain sovereign immunity “only to the extent that the \nConstitution has not divested them of their original powers and \ntransferred those powers to the Federal Government.”) \nThe Board argues that the plan of the Convention doctrine \nshould not apply in this case because this case involves the \nElections Clause of Section 4 of Article I of the Constitution.  The \nBoard relies on Allen v. Cooper, in which the Supreme Court \nreaffirmed that Congress could not abrogate a state’s sovereign \nimmunity through Congressional action pursuant to powers vested \nin Congress under Article I.  140 S.Ct. 994, 1001–1002 (2020).  But \nthe Supreme Court later applied Allen in PennEast, where the Court \nheld that no congressional abrogation is necessary where the States \nPage 10 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 11 of 27 \nagreed in the plan of the Convention not to assert any sovereign \nimmunity defense.  PennEast, 141 S.Ct., at 2259 (quoting Allen, \n140 S.Ct., at 1003.)  Instead, where the purposes of the \nConstitution require the powers of the States to yield to those of the \nFederal Government, the Constitution strips States of sovereign \nimmunity and no Congressional abrogation is required.  Id. \nHere, the Elections Clause is a “fundamental postulate” \nbestowing the government of the United States power to carry out \nthe Constitution’s purposes regarding federal elections.   Article I, \nSection 4 of the Constitution, the Elections Clause, states:  \nThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for \nSenators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in \neach State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress \nmay at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, \nexcept as to the Places of [choosing] Senators. \n \nThe Elections Clause, the Supreme Court has held, “reveal[s] the \nFramers’ understanding that the powers over the election of federal \nofficers had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.”  \nU.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 804 (1995).  \nRather than bestowing States the authority to regulate elections to \nwhich federal law must bend, the Constitution gave Congress \nplenary power over regulating federal elections such that the States’ \nPage 11 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 12 of 27 \nroles in federal elections have “always existed subject to the express \nqualification that [the States’ roles] ‘terminate[] according to federal \nlaw.’”  Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, \n15 (2013) (quoting Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 \nU.S. 341, 347 (2001)).  The Elections Clause, then, embodies the \nunderstanding between the States and the Federal Government at \nthe Founding that the States’ sovereign immunity would bend to the \npowers of the Federal Government over federal elections.  \nAccordingly, where Congress acts pursuant to its powers under the \nElections Clause, the plan of the Convention doctrine applies, and a \nstate will not be able to take refuge in the Eleventh Amendment’s \nsovereign immunity protections when sued in federal court. \nThe Seventh Circuit has held that the National Voter \nRegistration Act, the statute at issue here, was enacted pursuant to \nCongress’s authority under the Elections Clause.  League of Women \nVoters of Ind., Inc. v. Sullivan.  5 F.4th 714, 723 (7th Cir. 2021) \n(“Congress’s authority [to enact] the NVRA is rooted in the \nConstitution itself, whose Elections Clause expressly empowers \nCongress to make or alter state election regulations.”  Id. (cleaned \nup)).  Where, as here, the NVRA is allegedly violated by a state, the \nPage 12 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 13 of 27 \nplan of the Convention doctrine applies.  Therefore, the Court finds \nthat the Board, as an agency of the State of Illinois, is not entitled \nto sovereign immunity under the plan of the Convention doctrine \nand may be sued.  For the same reasons, the Board’s Motion to \nDismiss (d/e 9) is DENIED. \nii. Director Thomas and Deputy Director Hobson are also \nproper parties. \n \nDefendants Director Thomas and Deputy Director Hobson, \nboth employees of the Board, also move for summary judgment.  \nDirector Thomas and Deputy Director Hobson argue that they are \nimproper parties because they not tasked with the enforcement of \nthe NVRA.  However, the Foundation does not allege that Director \nThomas and Deputy Director Hobson have failed to enforce the \nNVRA, the Foundation alleges Director Thomas and Deputy Director \nHobson have violated the NVRA by enforcing Section 5/1A-25, the \nstate law they concededly are tasked with enforcing as employees \nfor the Board.  See 10 ILCS 5/1A-1; 10 ILCS 5/1A-25; Decl. of \nCheryl Hobson (d/e 30) ¶ 4 (duties include “maintaining and \nhelping oversee the statewide voter registration system”); Decl. of \nKyle Thomas (d/e 30) ¶ 4 (duties include “administration \nPage 13 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 14 of 27 \ndevelopment and implementation of policy and procedures of the \nstatewide voter registration program”).  The Foundation alleges that \nDirector Thomas’ and Deputy Director Hobson’s actions in \nenforcing Section 5/1A-25 by not allowing the Foundation to \nexamine or make copies of Illinois’s statewide voter registration list \nare violations of the NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision.  As a \nresult, Director Thomas and Deputy Director Hobson are directly \nresponsible for the allegations here and, therefore, are proper \nparties.  For the same reasons, Director Thomas’ and Deputy \nDirector Hobson’s Motion to Dismiss (d/e 9) is DENIED. \nB. The Foundation is entitled to summary judgment on Count I. \n \nBoth parties request summary judgment on the Foundation’s \nsingle claim that Section 5/1A-25 violates and is preempted by the \nPublic Disclosure Provision.  Generally, a preemption analysis \nbegins with a presumption against preemption because “the historic \npolice powers of the States were not to be superseded by” Congress.  \nRice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).  \nHowever, that presumption “does not hold when Congress acts \nunder [the Elections Clause], which empowers Congress to ‘make or \nalter’ state election regulations.”  Inter Tribal Council, 570 U.S., at \nPage 14 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 15 of 27 \n14 (quoting Art. I, § 4, cl. 1).  In such cases, like the one here, “the \nreasonable assumption is that the statutory text accurately \ncommunicates the scope of Congress’s pre-emptive intent.”  Id.  The \npresumption for, rather than against, federal preemption is, \ntherefore, the proper starting point here because this case involves \nthe NVRA, which was enacted pursuant to Congress’s powers under \nthe Elections Clause.  Cf. Inter Tribal, 570 U.S., at 15; Common \nCause v. Lawson, 937 F.3d 944, 947 (7th Cir. 2019).   \nThe question here, then, is whether Illinois’s Section 5/1A-25 \nconflicts with the Public Disclosure Provision of the NVRA.  See \nInter Tribal, 570 U.S., at 9.  “If so, the state law, so far as the \nconflict extends, ceases to be operative.”  Id. (quoting Ex parte \nSiebold, 100 U.S. 371, 392 (1880)).  The Court finds that Section \n5/1A-25 does so conflict and is, therefore, preempted by the NVRA.  \nThe disputes between the parties regarding Section 5/1A-25’s \nconflict with the Public Disclosure Provision are twofold.  First, the \nparties dispute whether the statewide voter registration list sought \nby the Foundation and prohibited from full disclosure by \nDefendants is a “record” within the meaning of the Public \nDisclosure Provision.  Second, the parties dispute whether Section \nPage 15 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 16 of 27 \n5/1A-25’s limitation on the disclosure of the statewide voter \nregistration list violates the NVRA’s mandate that Illinois make the \nlist “available for public inspection and . . . photocopying.”   \ni.  The statewide voter registration list is a “record” within \nthe meaning of the NVRA. \n \nThe NVRA mandates the public disclosure of “all records \nconcerning the implementation of programs and activities \nconducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of \nthe official list of eligible voters.”  52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1).  Neither \nthe NVRA’s definitions section, 52 U.S.C. § 20502, nor the NVRA’s \nimplementing regulations, 11 C.F.R. § 9428, specifically define “all \nrecords” as the term is used in the Public Disclosure Provision, so \nwhether “all records” includes Illinois’s statewide voter registration \nlist is a matter of statutory interpretation.  The question is also one \nof first impression for this District and the Seventh Circuit.  \nTherefore, the analysis must start with the text of the statute.  See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). \nWhen interpreting a statute in the first instance, the first step \nis “to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the \nPage 16 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 17 of 27 \ncase.”  Id.  “The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is \ndetermined by reference to the language itself, the specific context \nin which that language is used, and the broader context of the \nstatute as a whole.”  Id. at 341. \nDefendants argue that the words “all records” are qualified \nonly by the descriptive phrase “concerning the implementation of \nprograms and activities.”  That descriptive phrase, Defendants’ \nargument goes, means that the NVRA only mandates the public \ndisclosure of data or programs designed to maintain the statewide \nvoter registration list.  However, that argument puts an unbalanced \nemphasis on the phrases “concerning the implementation of \nprograms and activities” and “for the purpose of ensuring the \naccuracy and currency of the official list of eligible voters.”  On \nbalance, the two phrases, when read together, make clear that any \nrecord, be it data regarding maintenance activities, the processes \ninvolved in the maintenance activities, or the output of those \nmaintenance activities, including the statewide voter registration \nlist, must be made available to the public.  Indeed, it would not \nmake sense if the list, as the result of the maintenance activities, \nPage 17 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 18 of 27 \ncould not be viewed if the purpose of viewing the activities is to \nensure the output is correct.   \nTake, for example, the math equation ‘2+2=4.’  The process by \nwhich the output, the number 4, is derived is addition.  The inputs \nare the numbered terms ‘2’ and ‘2.’  The activity is the expression \n‘2+2.’  If there were a statute mandating, for the purpose of \nensuring the accuracy of the results of math equations, the public \ndisclosure of all records involved in the production of math \nequations, such a statute would certainly mandate the publication \nof the final product of ‘4.’  If not, how would one verify that the \naddition involved in the expression of the equation is functioning \ncorrectly?  Were only the terms, ‘2’ and ‘2,’ and the activity itself, \nthe addition operator, mandated to be published, and not the result \nof ‘4,’ there would be no way of knowing whether the activity, the \nfull ‘2+2’ expression, were functioning correctly in each instance.  \nThat the Public Disclosure Provision here mandates “all records” be \nmade public “for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and \ncurrency of” the statewide voter registration list similarly must \nmandate the production of both the activities involved in the list’s \nmaintenance and the list itself.  Otherwise, the phrase “for the \nPage 18 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 19 of 27 \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency” is rendered a \nnullity, as the accuracy and currency cannot be ensured without \nthe list itself.  See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (“It \nis ‘a cardinal principle of statutory construction’ that ‘a statute \nought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be \nprevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, \nor insignificant.’” (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 \n(2001)).  When every word and phrase in the Public Disclosure \nProvision is given equal weight, “all records” must include the \nstatewide voter registration list. \nDefendants also argue that, because section 20507(i)(2), the \nsubsection immediately following the Public Disclosure Provision, is \nthe only place in the NVRA itself that seeks to narrow or define \nwhat is meant by “all records,” the examples listed therein are the \nonly examples of what is a “record” under the statute.  But section \n20507(i)(2) states “the records maintained pursuant to paragraph \n(1) shall include lists of the names and addresses of all persons to \nwhom notices described in subsection (d)(2) are sent, and \ninformation concerning whether or not each such person has \nresponded to the notice as of the date that inspection of the records \nPage 19 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 20 of 27 \nis made.”  See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(2) (emphasis added).  Section \n20507(i)(2) does not say that the examples found therein are the \nonly examples of what can be a record or that other types of records \nare specifically excluded from the statute.  Instead, the Public \nDisclosure Provision casts a wide net, mandating “all records” be \nmade publicly available.  Such expansive language “sets a floor, not \na ceiling.”  Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc., 682 F.3d 331, 337 (4th \nCir. 2012) (rejecting the argument that section 20507(i)(2) limits “all \nrecords” to only those stated therein).  As explained above, the \nCourt finds that the phrase “all records,” as used in the Public \nDisclosure Provision, necessarily includes the statewide voter \nregistration list. \nThis finding is also supported by decisions from other federal \ncourts outside the Seventh Circuit, both at the Circuit level and \nDistrict level, holding that the Public Disclosure Provision includes \nrecords of an involving statewide voter registration lists.  See Project \nVote, 682 F.3d at 335–36 (holding that applications to register are \n“records” under the Public Disclosure Provision); Pub. Interest Legal \nFound. V. Bellows, Case No. 1:20-cv-00061, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n38875 (D. Me. Mar. 4, 2022); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Lamone, 399 F. \nPage 20 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 21 of 27 \nSupp. 3d 425, 439–41 (D. Md. 2019) (holding that voter registration \nlists are included in “all records”); True the Vote v. Hosemann, 43 F. \nSupp. 3d 693, 719 (S.D. Miss. 2014) (“The Court likewise concludes \nthat the Voter Roll is a ‘record’ and is the ‘official list of eligible \nvoters’ under the NVRA Public Disclosure Provision.” (cleaned up)). \nLastly, Defendants argue that the State’s interest in protecting \nindividuals’ privacy necessitates that the statewide voter \nregistration list be kept from public disclosure.  While the Court \nagrees that privacy interests are implicated here, the Court does not \nagree that those interests should allow Defendant’s to continue to \nviolate the NVRA.  While the Public Disclosure Provision “must be \nread in conjunction with the various statutes enacted by Congress \nto protect the privacy of individuals,” Pub. Int. Legal Found., Inc. v. \nN.C. State Bd. of Elections, 996 F.3d 257, 264 (4th Cir. 2021), the \nPublic Disclosure Provision also “does not require the disclosure of \nsensitive information that implicates [those] privacy concerns.”  \nProject Vote, Inc. v. Kemp, 208 F.Supp.3d 1320, 1344 (N.D. Ga. \nSept. 19, 2016) (Project Vote II).  According to the state law at issue \nin this case, the statewide voter registration list is already made \navailable to “State or local political committee[s] and . . . \nPage 21 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 22 of 27 \ngovernmental entit[ies] for governmental purpose[s].”  10 ILCS \n5/1A-25.  By Illinois’s own terms, then, the interest in protecting \ncitizens’ privacy is not infringed when the list is made available for \nviewing.  Moreover, to the extent that political committees and \ngovernmental entities are able to protect privacy in the way general \npublic disclosure of the list cannot, the Court believes that proper \nredaction of highly sensitive information can be accomplished \nwithout an undue burden on the State.  Indeed, other courts have \nalso held that, in complying with the Public Disclosure Provision, \nStates may limit the revelation of highly sensitive information.  See \nProject Vote, 682 F.3d at 339 (redacting Social Security Numbers); \nTrue the Vote, 43 F.Supp.3d at 734 (redacting telephone numbers \nand Social Security Numbers); Project Vote II, 208 F.Supp.3d at \n1344 (redacting telephone numbers, Social Security Numbers, \nportions of emails, and birthdates).  As such, the Court finds that \nIllinois’s interest in protecting the privacy of its citizens is not so \ngreat as to permit noncompliance with the Public Disclosure \nProvision. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the statewide voter \nregistration list sought by the Foundation is a “record concerning \nPage 22 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 23 of 27 \nthe implementation of programs and activities conducted for the \npurpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of the official list of \neligible voters.”  See 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1). \nii. Section 5/1A-25’s limitation on the public disclosure \nand photocopying of the statewide voter registration \nlist violates the Public Disclosure Provision of the \nNVRA.  \n \nHaving found that the statewide voter registration list is a \n“record” for purposes of the Public Disclosure Provision, the Court \nnow finds Illinois’s Section 5/1A-25 is preempted by the NVRA. \nWhere a state law either “stands as an obstacle to the \naccomplishment and execution of” an act of Congress, Hines v. \nDavidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941), or makes “compliance with both \nfederal law and state regulations” impossible, Florida Lime & \nAvocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142–143 (1963), the \nstate law will be preempted.  The “ultimate task in any pre-emption \ncase is to determine whether state regulation is consistent with the \nstructure and purpose of the statute as a whole.”  Gade v. Nat’l \nSolid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 98 (1992).   \nThe NVRA was enacted by Congress to “protect the integrity of \nthe electoral process” and “to ensure that accurate and current \nPage 23 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 24 of 27 \nvoter registration rolls are maintained.”  52 U.S.C. § 20501(b).  To \nthat end, the NVRA mandates that “[e]ach State shall maintain for \nat least 2 years and shall make available for public inspection and, \nwhere available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all records \nconcerning the implementation of programs and activities \nconducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of \nofficial lists of eligible voters,” including the statewide voter \nregistration list at issue here.  52 U.S.C. 20507(i)(1).   \nIllinois’s state law, in turn, explicitly prohibits such disclosure \nsubject to only two exceptions: (1) disclosure of the statewide voter \nregistration list to political committees and governmental entities, \nand (2) allowing the public to view the list only “on a computer \nscreen at the Springfield office of the State Board of Elections, \nduring normal business hours other than during the 27 days before \nan election, but the person viewing the list under this exception \nmay not print, duplicate, transmit, or alter the list.”  10 ILCS 5/1A-\n25.  Moreover, viewing the list in full is, as Defendants admit, not \npossible; a person can only search the list for specific individuals.  \nDSUMF (d/e 30) ¶¶ 10–11. \nPage 24 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 25 of 27 \nSection 5/1A-25 conflicts with the Public Disclosure Provision.  \nWhile the NVRA mandates the Board make the statewide voter \nregistration list both available for inspection and available for \nphotocopying at a reasonable cost, Section5/1A-25 explicitly \nprohibits any printing, duplication, or transmission of the same list.  \nIndeed, when the Foundation’s representative traveled to the \nBoard’s office in Springfield, Illinois, the representative was not \nallowed to view, print, or copy the list.  Not only was Defendant’s \nrefusal to allow the Foundation’s representative to view the list in \nviolation of Section 5/1A-25’s own public disclosure mandate, \nSection 5/1A-25’s limitation on photocopying or duplication clearly \nconflicts with the Public Disclosure Provision’s mandate that the \nBoard make such duplication available at a reasonable cost.  As a \nresult, Defendant’s refusal to make the statewide voter registration \nlist available for viewing by individuals the same way the list is \navailable to political parties is a violation of both Section 5/1A-25 \nitself and the Public Disclosure Provision.  Additionally, Section \n5/1A-25’s duplication prohibition is preempted by the NVRA.  Gade, \n505 U.S. at 98 (Where “compliance with both federal and state \nPage 25 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 26 of 27 \nregulations is a physical impossibility,” the state law is preempted \nby the federal law.) \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n \nThe Foundation has shown that, on the undisputed material \nfacts, Defendants acted in violation of the Public Disclosure \nProvision of the NVRA when Defendants refused to make available \nfor viewing and photocopying the full statewide voter registration \nlist.  The Foundation has also shown that Section 5/1A-25 conflicts \nwith, and is preempted by, the Public Disclosure provision insofar \nas Section 5/1A-25 prohibits the photocopying and duplication of \nthe same list.  Accordingly, the Foundation’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment (d/e 22) is GRANTED, and Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment (d/e 29) is DENIED.  For similar reasons, the \nMotion to Dismiss (d/e 9) is DENIED.   \nDefendants are hereby ORDERED to implement policies and \nprocedures which make available to the public the statewide voter \nregistration list, allowing for redaction of telephone numbers, Social \nSecurity Numbers, street numbers of home addresses, birthdates, \nidentifiable portions of email addresses, and other highly sensitive \npersonal information.  Defendants are further ORDERED, pursuant \nPage 26 of 27 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 37    Page 27 of 27 \nto 52 U.S.C. §20510(c), to pay the Foundation its attorneys’ fees, \ncosts, and expenses.  The Clerk is DIRECTED to enter judgment in \nfavor of Plaintiff the Foundation.  This case is closed. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nENTERED: March 8, 2022 \nFOR THE COURT: \n \n            /s/ Sue E.

(Doc. 1, Prayer for Relief, ¶ 1.) Plaintiff further seeks a \n                                            \n1 Bernadette Matthews is the Acting Executive Director of the Illinois State Board of Elections, and therefore is \nautomatically substituted for former Executive Director Steve Sandvoss. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 25(d).  \n 20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                  Page 1 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 35    Filed: 10/13/21    Page 2 of 9 \ndeclaration that Section 8(i) preempts any restriction contained in 10 ILCS 5/1A-25 that prevents \nPlaintiff from inspecting and copying list maintenance data and the statewide voter restriction list. \n(Doc. 1, Prayer for Relief, ¶ 2.) Plaintiff requests this Court order Defendants to produce the \nstatewide list maintenance data and voter registration list or otherwise allow Plaintiff to copy the \nlist and permanently enjoin Defendants from denying requests to inspect similar list maintenance \ndata attached to voter registration lists in the future. (Doc. 1, Prayer for Relief, ¶ 3.) \n  Defendants Thomas, Hobson, and the Illinois State Board of Elections filed a joint motion \nto dismiss, arguing, inter alia, Plaintiff’s claim against SBE should be dismissed because the \nEleventh Amendment bars suit against the State and its agencies and departments. (Doc. 9, ¶ 2.) \nPlaintiff responded, arguing (1) Congress has overridden SBE’s immunity by including a private \nright of action against State entities that violate the NVRA; (2) SBE is the only election entity \nresponsible for complying with the NVRA; and (3) the doctrine of Ex parte Young defeats the \nEleventh Amendment immunity defense in this case. (Doc. 13 at 2-6.) Defendants moved for \nsummary judgment, arguing in part that the court should enter judgment in favor of SBE as the \nclaim against it is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. (Doc. 29, ¶ 8.) Both the motion to dismiss \nand the motion for summary judgment are currently pending before the Court.    \n   On September 29, 2021, the Court entered a text order noting it had taken judicial notice \nof the order in Illinois Conservative Union v. State of Illinois, 20-C-5542, Doc. 29 (N.D. Ill. \nSeptember 28, 2021), which denied, “under the plan of Convention doctrine,” the State of Illinois’ \nmotion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. Id. at *3. The Court has \nordered both parties in this case to file briefs on the issue of whether the plan of convention doctrine \npermits suit against the State of Illinois and SBE in federal court by private parties.  \n 20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                  Page 2 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 35    Filed: 10/13/21    Page 3 of 9 \n  The Northern District’s reasoning should not be followed here because under the plan of \nconvention doctrine there must be compelling evidence that the States consented to suit. While the \nElections Clause provides that States shall prescribe the Times, Place, and Manner of federal \nelections with Congress having the authority to alter such regulations, there is no such similar \nprovision giving Congress the authority to alter State regulations on qualifications to vote in \nelections. In other words, there is no compelling evidence that the States consented to suit, such as \nthe present suit, over its authority to regulate voter qualifications.  \nBACKGROUND \nThe SBE has “general supervision over the administration of the registration and election \nlaws throughout the State,” and has the authority to perform other duties as prescribed by law. ILL. \nCONST. art III, § 5; 10 ILCS 5/1A-1. Section 1A-25 of the Illinois Election Code provides that a \ncentralized statewide voter registration list “shall be created and maintained by the State Board of \nElections  as  provided  in  this  section.”  10  ILCS  5/1A-25.  “The  centralized  statewide  voter \nregistration list shall be compiled from the voter registration data bases of each election authority \nin this State.” 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(1). List maintenance activities that affect registration information \ninclude: documenting the registrant’s status as active, inactive, ineligible, or any other internal \nclassification, documenting the registrant’s name and birthdate, noting a registrant has a new \naddress, documenting that the registrant has requested to be removed from the registration list, \ndocumenting that a confirmation card was sent to a registrant’s address, and documenting in the \nregistration record that a registrant was reported deceased. (Doc. 22-1, ¶¶ 8-14, 16, 18-19.) \nARGUMENT \nThe Court should not apply the plan of the convention doctrine because there is no \ncompelling evidence that the States consented to lawsuits by citizens of another State concerning \n 20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                  Page 3 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 35    Filed: 10/13/21    Page 4 of 9 \nthe regulation of qualifications to vote. The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial \npower of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced \nor prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens of any \nForeign State.” U.S. Const. amend. XI. The Eleventh Amendment does not apply: (1) where \nCongress has abrogated the State's immunity from suit through an unequivocal expression of its \nintent to do so through a valid exercise of its power; (2) where a State has waived its immunity \nand consented to the suit; and (3) where the suit is one against a State official for prospective \ninjunctive relief. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908); Sonnleitner v. York, 304 F. 3d 704, 717 \n(7th Cir. 2002). States have consented to some suits through the “plan of the convention,” because \nsovereign immunity derives from “the structure of the original Constitution itself.” Alden v. Me, \n527 U.S. 706, 728, 755 (1999). “The ‘plan of the Convention’ includes certain waivers of sovereign \nimmunity to which all States implicitly consented at the founding.” PennEast Pipeline Co., LLC \nv. New Jersey, 141 S. Ct. 2244, 2258 (2021). The Supreme Court has recognized plan of the \nconvention waivers in bankruptcy proceedings, suits by other States, and suits by the Federal \nGovernment. Id. (citing Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 379 (2006); Allen v. Cooper, \n589 U. S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 994 (2020); South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U.S. 286, 318, (1904); \nUnited States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, 646 (1892)). States retain sovereign immunity from private \nlawsuits even though they have consented to suits brought by other States or by the federal \ngovernment by virtue of ratification of the Constitution. See EEOC v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of \nWis. Sys., 288 F.3d 296, 299 (7th Cir. 2002) (applying Alden in holding that university was not \nentitled to sovereign immunity in ADEA claim brought by EEOC even though sovereign immunity \nbarred private lawsuits seeking monetary damages under the ADEA).  \n 20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                  Page 4 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 35    Filed: 10/13/21    Page 5 of 9 \n  The Supreme Court has not applied the plan of the convention doctrine to lawsuits brought \nby citizens of a State against another State’s chief election agency for alleged violations of the \nNVRA. Nor has the Seventh Circuit. “Since [Seminol Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996)], \nthe Supreme Court has not referred to any part of the constitutional design or structure that would \npermit a private party to bring suit against a State under a law enacted by Congress pursuant to \nany of its Article I legislative powers.” Nelson v. La Crosse Cnty. Dist. Atty. (In re Nelson), 301 \nF.3d 829, 833 (7th Cir. 2002).  \n  In Illinois Conservative Union v. State of Illinois, 20-C-5542, Doc. 29 (N.D. Ill. September \n28, 2021), the court denied SBE’s motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity, finding the \nplan of the convention doctrine allowed private suits against the SBE and Illinois to enforce the \nNVRA.  The  Northern  District  reasoned  that  “[t]he  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  the \nElections Clause expressly delegates power concerning federal elections to the States, meaning \nthat the Constitution divested the States of any original power over elections and gave that power \nto the federal government.” Id. at *3 (citing U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 804–\n05 (1995)) (“[T]he provisions governing elections reveal the Framers’ understanding that powers \nover the election of federal officers had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.”). \nThe court also cited Harkless v. Brunner, 545 F.3d 445, 454-55 (6th Cir. 2008), wherein the court \nstated that “[i]n ratifying Article I, Section 4, the states . . . gave Congress plenary authority over \nfederal elections.” The Northern District reasoned that “‘[w]hen it comes to time, place, and \nmanner  regulations  for  federal  elections,  the Constitution  primarily  treats  states as  election \nadministrators rather than sovereign entities.’” Id. citing Harkless, 545 F.3d at 454. The Northern \nDistrict concluded that “in the Constitution, the States consented to suit for claims related to the \ntime, place, and manner of federal elections, including the claim raised by Plaintiffs concerning \n 20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                  Page 5 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 35    Filed: 10/13/21    Page 6 of 9 \nthe State and the Board’s compliance with the NVRA.” Illinois Conservative Union, 20-C-5542, \nDoc. 29 at *3. \n  The Northern District overlooked Supreme Court precedent rejecting claims that the plan \nof the convention authorized suits against the States by private parties via Article I. In Allen v. \nCooper, 140 S. Ct. 994, 1007 (2020), the Court held that Congress had not validly abrogated the \nStates’ immunity pursuant to either its Article I powers or its Fourteenth Amendment powers when \nit passed the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act. Allen v. Cooper, 140 S. Ct. 994, 1007 (2020). \nIt also rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the Intellectual Property Clause, itself, abrogated \nimmunity, under the plan of the convention doctrine. Id. at 1001–03. The plaintiff argued for an \nextension of Katz, which held that the States waived immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause, and \ncontended the Court should undertake a clause-by-clause analysis and apply the same rule to \ncopyright claims. The Court disagreed, clarifying that its ruling in Katz recognized the sui generis \nnature of bankruptcy and was a “good-for-one-clause-only holding,” premised in part on the fact \nthat bankruptcy jurisdiction is “‘principally in rem’—meaning that it is ‘premised on the debtor \nand his estate, and not on the creditors’ (including a State)” and, therefore, “it does not implicate \nStates’ sovereignty to nearly the same degree as other kinds of jurisdiction.” Id. at 1002–03.  \n  Here, there is nothing sui generis about the Elections Clause that renders it any different \nthan the Intellectual Property Clause, which has been held insufficient to abrogate immunity \nthrough the plan of the convention to allow suits by private parties. This is not an in rem \nproceeding,  and  Plaintiffs  plainly  invoke  ordinary  party  jurisdiction  that  implicates  State \nsovereignty. This Court should apply Allen, a case the Northern District overlooked, and recognize \nSBE’s immunity. \n 20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                  Page 6 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 35    Filed: 10/13/21    Page 7 of 9 \n  Moreover, even if the States waived immunity by ratifying the Elections Clause, that \nwaiver doesn’t extend to this case. The Clause only requires that “[t]he Times, Places and Manner \nof holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the \nLegislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, \nexcept as to the Places of chusing Senators.” US Const. Art. 1, ¶ 4, Cl. 1. In this case, Plaintiff’s \nlawsuit does not concern the time, place or manner of federal elections. Instead, Plaintiff seeks \ncopies of the statewide voter registration list and list maintenance data, which concerns the state’s \nauthority to regulate voter qualifications. (Doc. 1, ¶ 18; Doc. 1, Prayer for Relief, ¶ 3; Doc. 1-4; \nDoc. 1-7; Doc. 8, ¶ 18; Doc. 1-9; Doc. 8.) \n  In Husted v. A. Philip Randolf Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833, 1835 (2018), the Supreme Court held \nthat the Sixth Circuit erred when it found Ohio’s procedure for removing individuals who had not \nvoted in recent elections from the rolls of voters violated the NVRA. The appellees had argued \nthat Congress’s authority to regulate the “Times, Places and Manner” of holding congressional \nelections  includes  the  authority  to  impose  limits  on  evidence  a  State  may  consider  when \nmaintaining its voter rolls. Id. at 1849. The Court rejected this argument and noted: \n[A]s originally understood, the Times, Places and Manner Clause grants Congress power \n‘only over the ‘when, where, and how’ of holding congressional elections,’ not over the \nquestion of who can vote.  The ‘Manner of holding Elections’ was understood to refer to \n‘the circumstances under which elections were held and the mechanics of the actual \nelection.’ It does not give Congress the authority to displace state voter qualifications \nor dictate what evidence a State may consider in deciding whether those qualifications \nhave been met.  \n \nId. at 1850. (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). \n \n  Hence, even assuming States consented to suits by private citizens of another State \ninvolving the times, places and manner of federal elections, there is no authority, let alone \ncompelling evidence, for the proposition that States consented to suits, such as the present suit, \n 20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                  Page 7 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 35    Filed: 10/13/21    Page 8 of 9 \nconcerning a State’s authority to regulate voter qualifications by maintaining list maintenance data \nvoter registration lists, or voter rolls. The Supreme Court has stated that in “exercising its Article \nI powers Congress may subject the States to private suits in their own courts only if there is \n‘compelling evidence’ that the States were required to surrender this power to Congress pursuant \nto the constitutional design.” Alden, 527 U.S. at 730-31. There is no compelling evidence that the \nStates were required to surrender the power to decide voter qualifications, which would not be \nincluded within the definitions discussed above of the Times, Places and Manner of elections. \nWhile the elections clause explicitly provides “Congress may at any time by Law make or alter \nsuch Regulations” concerning the Times, Places and Manner of elections, there is no indication \nthe States consented, through the plan of the convention, to law suits, such as the present lawsuit, \nconcerning the regulation of voter qualifications. \nWHEREFORE, Defendants, Bernadette Matthews, Kyle Thomas, Cheryl Hobson, and \nIllinois State Board of Elections respectfully request the Court grant their motion for summary \njudgment.  \n          Respectfully submitted, \nBERNADETTE MATTHEWS, KYLE THOMAS, \nCHERYL  HOBSON,  and  ILLINOIS  STATE \nBOARD OF ELECTIONS,  \n \n  Defendants, \n \nThomas R.

The Court found the undisputed material facts show that section 8(i) of the National \nVoter Registration Act (NVRA), 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1), preempts the Illinois Election Code, 10 \nILCS 5/1A-25. (Doc. 37, p. 2). The Court found, inter alia, that the Illinois statewide voter \nregistration list is a “record” within the meaning of the NVRA and that section 1A-25 of the Illinois \nElection Code, which limits the public disclosure and photocopying of the state’s voter registration \n20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                      Page 1 of 7 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 40    Filed: 04/04/22    Page 2 of 7 \nlist, violates the Public Disclosure Provision of the NVRA, 25 U.S.C. 20507(i)(1). (Doc. 37, p. 16, \n23) The Court held Defendants violated the NVRA by refusing to make the full statewide voter \nregistration list available for viewing and photocopying to Plaintiff. (Doc. 37, p. 26). The Court \nfurther held section 1A-25 of the Illinois Election Code is preempted by 25 U.S.C. 20507(i)(1) \nbecause it prohibits the photocopying and duplication of the list. (Doc. 37, p. 26). The Court \nordered Defendants to take actions by implementing policies and procedures which make the \nstatewide  voter  registration  list  available  to  the  public,  allowing  for  redaction  of  personal \ninformation  such  as  telephone  numbers,  social  security  numbers,  street  numbers  of  home \naddresses, birthdates, identifiable portions of email address, and other highly sensitive personal \ninformation. (Doc. 37, p. 26).  \nDefendants request the Court reconsider and reverse its opinion finding section 1A-25 of \nthe  Illinois  Election  Code  is  preempted  by  the  Public  Disclosure  Provision  of  the  NVRA. \nAlternatively, Defendants request the Court clarify its order granting Plaintiff an injunction by \nspecifying in detail the policies and procedures Defendants must take to make the statewide voter \nregistration list available to the public.  \nLegal Standard \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) a court may “relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding” for certain reasons, including “mistake, \ninadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). Courts can also reconsider \nan earlier order if a party raises “any other reason that justifies relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nMotions for reconsideration serve the limited function of correcting manifest errors of law or fact \nor to present newly discovered evidence which could not have been adduced during pendency of \n20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                      Page 2 of 7 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 40    Filed: 04/04/22    Page 3 of 7 \nthe summary judgment motion. Rathwell Cotton Co. v. Rosenthal & Co., 827 F. 2d 246, 251 (7th \nCir. 1987).  \nInjunctions and restraining orders are governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. \nRule 65(d) provides every order granting an injunction and every restraining order must “(A) state \nthe reasons why it issued; (B) state its terms specifically; and (C) describe in reasonable detail—\nand not by referring to the complaint or other document—the act or acts restrained or required.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(d). See e.g. International Longshoremen’s Ass’n v. Philadelphia Marine Trade \nAss’n, 389, U.S. 64, 76 (1967) (finding the district court’s decree, which could only be construed \nas an order granting an injunction did not comply with Rule 65 where it failed to “state in ‘specific \n. . . terms’ the acts that it required or prohibited.”); see also e.g., Chathas v. Local 134 IBEW, 233 \nF. 3d 508, 512 (7th Cir. 2000) (finding the district court’s order violated Rule 65 where it contained \nno reasons and no terms). A court has an independent duty to ensure its injunctions comply with \nthese requirements. Chicago Bd. Of Educ. v. Substance, Inc., 354 F. 3d 624, 632 (7th Cir. 2003). \nIn issuing an injunction, a district court is required to issue a standalone document containing the \ninjunction. C.Y. Wholesale, Inc. v. Holcomb, 965 F.3d 541, 545 (7th Cir. 2020). “The failure to \nenter an independent injunction requires one to infer the scope of the injunction from the opinion.” \nId.  \nArgument \nI.  Reconsideration is Warranted Based on the Plain and Unambiguous Language of the \nStatute \n \nThe Court should reconsider and reverse its holding that the undisputed material facts \ndemonstrate that 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) preempts 10 ILCS 5/1A-25 because the plain and \nunambiguous language of section 8(i) only requires states make available for public inspection and \nphotocopying  records  concerning  list  maintenance  activities,  not  the  actual  statewide  voter \n20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                      Page 3 of 7 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 40    Filed: 04/04/22    Page 4 of 7 \nregistration list.  Courts must presume the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in \na statute what it says. Conn. Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). “[I]t is a general \nprinciple of statutory construction that when ‘Congress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.’” Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal \nCo., 534 U.S. 438, 452 (2002) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)). \nApplying these principles to the case at bar leads to only one conclusion: section 8(i) of the NVRA \ndoes not preempt section 1A-25 of the Illinois Election Code.  \nSection 8(i) of the NVRA provides, in pertinent part, that each state shall maintain and \nmake available for public inspection and where available, photocopying of “all records concerning \nthe implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy \nand currency of official lists of eligible voters . . . .” 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) (emphasis added). \nThe plain and unambiguous language of section 8(i) only applies to list maintenance activities, not \nthe voter registration list. Congress chose not to include voter registration lists in the terms of the \nPublic Disclosure Provision of the NVRA, and limited disclosure to records concerning the \nimplementation of programs and activities that are done for the purpose of ensuring the list’s \naccuracy. Within other provisions of Section 8, Congress used phrases such as “voter registration \nroll,” “official list of eligible voters,” and “official list of voters.” See 52 U.S.C. §§ 20507(a)(3) \n(“official list of eligible voters”); § 20507(a)(4) (“official list of eligible voters”); § 20507(b)(2) \n(“voter registration roll,” “official list of voters,” “official list of eligible voters”); § 20507(d)(1) \n(“official list of eligible voters”); § 20507(d)(3) (“official list of eligible voters”); § 20507(f) \n(“official list of eligible voters”). In fact, the phrase “official list’ of voters” also appears in the \n20-3190-SEM-TSH                                                                                                      Page 4 of 7 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 40    Filed: 04/04/22    Page 5 of 7 \nvery sentence at issue here. 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i). If Congress wanted the “official lists of eligible \nvoters” to constitute a “record” subject to disclosure it would have said so explicitly. \n For these reasons, the Court should reconsider and reverse its opinion finding section 1A-\n25 of the Illinois Election Code is preempted by the Public Disclosure Provision of the NVRA. \n II.  Alternatively, Clarification of the Court’s Injunction is Necessary to Comply with \nRule 65. \n \nThe Court should clarify its Opinion and Order to conform with the requirements of Rule \n65(d), including stating the terms of the injunctive relief to specifically describe the acts required. \nIn this case, the opinion and order does not comply with Rule 65(d). First, there is no standalone \ndocument or order containing the injunction. Rather, the injunctive relief is contained within the \nbody and conclusion of the opinion and order. \n  Further, the opinion and order does not sufficiently specify its terms or describe in detail \nthe specific acts required. The order requires Defendants to take actions by implementing policies \nand procedures which makes the statewide voter registration list available to the public, allowing \nfor certain redactions. (Doc. 37, p. 26). It should specifically state that the injunctive relief requires \nthe list be made available.

This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because \nthe action arises under the laws of the United States. This Court also has jurisdiction under 52 \nU.S.C. § 20510(b), because the action seeks injunctive and declaratory relief under the NVRA. \nThis Court may also grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n2.  Venue in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), because the \nDefendants reside in this district, and under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), because a substantial part of \nthe events giving rise to the claim occurred in this district. \nPARTIES \n1 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 2 of 11 \n3.  The Public Interest Legal Foundation, Inc., (the “Foundation”) is a non-partisan, \npublic interest organization incorporated and based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Foundation \nseeks to promote the integrity of elections nationwide through research, education, remedial \nprograms, and litigation. The Foundation regularly utilizes the NVRA’s Public Disclosure \nProvision and state and federal open records laws that require government records be made \navailable to the public. Using records and data compiled through these open records laws, the \nFoundation analyzes the programs and activities of state and local election officials in order to \ndetermine whether lawful efforts are being made to keep voter rolls current and accurate. The \nFoundation also uses records and data to produce and disseminate reports, articles, blog and \nsocial media posts, and newsletters in order to advance the public education aspect of its \norganizational mission. \n4.  Defendant Steve Sandvoss is the Executive Director of the Illinois State Board of \nElections, which has the duties and responsibilities of the Secretary of State and State Electoral \nBoard to supervise the administration of the registration and election laws throughout the State of \nIllinois. 10 ILCS 5/1A-8(1); 10 ILCS 5/1A-8(12).  \n5.  Defendant Sandvoss, as the Executive Director, “shall exercise general \nsupervision over the operation of the business of the Board and its equipment, facilities, \nemployees and consultants, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board and as \notherwise directed by the Board.”  10 ILCS 5/1A-10.  \n6.  Defendant Cheryl Hobson is the Deputy Director of Voting and Registration \nwithin the Illinois State Board of Elections and is responsible for providing copies of the voter \nregistration list to those not restricted from receiving it.  \n2 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 3 of 11 \n7.  Defendant Kyle Thomas is the Director of Voting Systems and Registration and \nhas responsibility for maintaining the statewide voter registration list on behalf of the State \nBoard of Elections.   \n8.  Defendant Illinois State Board of Elections has general supervision over the \nadministration of the registration and election laws in the State of Illinois. 10 ILCS 5/1A.1. \n9.  Defendant Illinois State Board of Elections has all duties and responsibilities of \nthe State Electoral Board and the Secretary of State as provided in the State Election Code, \ncodified at 10 ILCS 5. 10 ILCS 5/1A.8(1).  \nINTRODUCTION \nEstablishment of a Centralized Illinois Statewide Voter Registration List \n10.  Section 10 ILCS 5/1A-25 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes requires that a \n“centralized statewide voter registration list” be created and maintained by the State Board of \nElections. \n11.  Section 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(1) provides that “[t]he centralized statewide voter \nregistration list shall be compiled from the voter registration data bases of each election authority \nin this State.”  \n12.  Section 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) requires that “[t]he registration information \nmaintained by each election authority shall be synchronized with that authority’s information on \nthe statewide list at least every 24 hours.” \nIllinois’s Restricted Access Law \n13.  Section 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) restricts those allowed to receive a copy of the voter \nregistration list to just two types of entities: political committees or government entities \n3 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 4 of 11 \n(“Restricted Access Law”). No other entity or individual is allowed to receive a copy of the voter \nregistration list under the Restricted Access Law.  \n14.  The Restricted Access Law contains just one exception, which is that a person \nmay view the voter registration list at the office of the State Board of Elections:  \nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of voter registration information, \nthe disclosure of any portion of the centralized statewide voter registration list \nto any person or entity other than to a State or local political committee and \nother than to a governmental entity for a governmental purpose is specifically \nprohibited except as follows: (1) subject to security measures adopted by the \nState Board of Elections which, at a minimum, shall include the keeping of a \ncatalog or database, available for public view, including the name, address, \nand telephone number of the person viewing the list as well as the time of that \nviewing, any person may view the list on a computer screen at the \nSpringfield office of the State Board of Elections, during normal business \nhours other than during the 27 days before an election, but the person viewing \nthe list under this exception may not print, duplicate, transmit, or alter the list; \nor (2) as may be required by an agreement the State Board of Elections has \nentered into with a multi-state voter registration list maintenance system. \n(Source: P.A. 98-115, eff. 7-29-13; 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) \nThe NVRA’s Public Disclosure Provision \n15.  The NVRA provides, in relevant part, “Each State shall maintain for at least 2 \nyears and shall make available for public inspection and, where available, photocopying at a \nreasonable cost, all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted \nfor the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters[.]” 52 \nU.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) (hereafter, the “Public Disclosure Provision”). \n16.  The Public Disclosure Provision is designed to “ensure that election officials are \nfulfilling their list maintenance duties” and is “available to any member of the public.” Bellitto v. \nSnipes, No. 16-cv-61474, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103617, at *12 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2018). The \nPublic Disclosure Provision “convey[s] Congress’s intention that the public should be \nmonitoring the state of the voter rolls and the adequacy of election officials’ list maintenance \n4 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 5 of 11 \nprograms. Accordingly, election officials must provide full public access to all records related to \ntheir list maintenance activities, including their voter rolls.” Id. at *12-13.  \n17.  The Public Disclosure Provision “embodies Congress’s conviction that Americans \nwho are eligible under law to vote have every right to exercise their franchise, a right that must \nnot be sacrificed to administrative chicanery, oversights, or inefficiencies.” Project Vote/Voting \nfor Am., Inc. v. Long, 682 F.3d 331, 334-35 (4th Cir. 2012). \n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nDenial of Access \n \n18.  On October 16, 2019, the Foundation emailed a letter to Steve Sandvoss, the \nExecutive Director of the Illinois State Board of Elections. The letter requested an electronic \ncopy of Illinois’s statewide voter registration list pursuant to the NVRA’s Public Disclosure \nProvision. Exhibit A. \n19.  The letter acknowledged that 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) appears to prohibit any person \nor entity other than a political committee from receiving the requested voter registration list. \nExhibit A. \n20.  The letter further explained that the NVRA, as a federal enactment, supersedes \nand preempts Illinois law and therefore a denial of the Foundation’s request would violate the \nNVRA. Exhibit A. \n21.  On October 29, 2019, General Counsel for the Board, Ken Menzel, responded in a \nletter to the Foundation. Exhibit B. The letter stated: \nWe have received your letter dated October 16, 2019, alleging a violation of 52 \nUSC § 20507(i) by the State of Illinois based upon an allegation that “Illinois’ \ndisclosure and duplication limitations violate the text and intent of Section 8 of the \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA).” \n5 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 6 of 11 \nYour organization is authorized to participate in the “public inspection” (52 U.S.C. \n§ 20507(i)(1)) of Illinois voter registration information.  As you correctly note in \nyour  letter,  Illinois  law  provides  that  “any  person  may  view  the  centralized \nstatewide voter registration list on a computer screen at the Springfield office of the \nState Board of Elections, during normal business hours other than during the 27 \ndays before an election.” 10ILCS 5/4-8; see also 10 ILCS 5-7, 6-35.”   \nAny  relevant  information  regarding  Illinois  list  maintenance  efforts  in  the \npossession of the SBE would be made available during our normal business hours \n(8:00AM to 4:30PM CST) at our main office in Springfield, Illinois.  Reasonable \nadvanced notice of when your staff would like to visit would be appreciated and \nallow for a more efficient visit.” We look forward to hearing from you.  If you have \nany  questions  or  comments,  please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  me  at \nkmenzel@elections.il.gov or [redacted].  \nId. \n22.  On November 14, 2019, the Foundation sent a letter to Mr. Menzel via email, \nacknowledging his response and advising him that the “NVRA requires not only inspection of \nvoter list maintenance records, but also reproduction” of them.  It further advised that “Illinois \nlaw appears to conflict with this requirement because it provides that we ‘may not print, \nduplicate, transmit, or alter the list.’ 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4).” Exhibit C.  \n23.  The letter asked for clarification as to whether the State Board would permit the \nFoundation to copy or reproduce the statewide voter registration list should the Foundation send \nsomeone to Illinois for the inspection.  \n24.  Counsel for the Foundation sent follow up emails on November 21, December 11 \nand on a third date, each asking to schedule an inspection of the voter registration list in \nSpringfield. Exhibit D, p. 2. \n25.  On January 23, 2020, counsel for the Foundation received an email from \nBernadette Matthews, who advised that she had replaced Mr. Menzel as counsel for the Board, \nand that she was responding to the Foundation’s earlier requests to visit the office for an \ninspection. Ms. Matthews stated that she would send the request to Kyle Thomas, Director of \n6 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 7 of 11 \nVoting Systems and Registration so that he could “touch base” with counsel “about a visit to the \noffice.” Exhibit D, p. 1.  \n26.  On January 31, 2020, counsel for the Foundation traveled from Indianapolis, \nIndiana to the SBE office in Springfield to inspect the voter registration list on the computer at \nthe SBE office. Exhibit E, Declaration of Sue Becker.  \n27.  Upon arrival, counsel was given access to a computer monitor but was told that \nshe could not print a record, photocopy or reproduce the screen, photograph the screen, print the \nscreen or use a flash drive to obtain a copy of any sort of any information viewed. She was also \nassigned an employee to remain near her as she sat at the public access desk. Exhibit E.  \n28.  When counsel asked for assistance in locating the voter registration list, the \nmonitoring employee responded that the list was not available on the computer. Exhibit E.  \n29.  The employee further confirmed that information in the public access voter \nregistration database could only be searched by inputting one specific name or specific birthdate \nat a time. Exhibit E.  \n30.  Further communication with the monitoring employee confirmed that it was not \npossible to conduct a general search of the list using a variety of search criteria, such as which \nregistrants had been subjected to various list maintenance procedures including the transmission \nof an address confirmation card. Exhibit E.  \n31.  On February 21, 2020, the Foundation sent a Notice Letter to Defendants that the \nBoard’s refusal to produce or allow the photocopying of any of the requested documents was a \nviolation of the NVRA, and that the violation needed to be corrected within 20 days of receipt of \nthe notice or else a lawsuit could be filed. Exhibit F.  \n32.  The Foundation received no response to its Notice Letter.   \n7 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 8 of 11 \nCOUNT I \n \nVIOLATION OF SECTION 8(i)(1) OF THE NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT \nRefusal to Produce Voter Registration List Maintenance Records \n \n33.  The Foundation realleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein. \n34.  The requested record(s) are in the possession, custody, and control of the \nDefendants. \n35.  The voter registration list, as described in 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4), is a record that \nfalls under the Public Disclosure Provision of the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. § 20507(i) and must be \nproduced. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Lamone, 399 F. Supp. 3d 425, 438-442, 446 (D. Md. \n2019); True the Vote v. Hosemann, 43 F. Supp. 3d 693, 723 (S.D. Miss. 2014) (“The Court \nlikewise concludes that the Voter Roll is a ‘record’ and is the ‘official list[] of eligible voters’ \nunder the NVRA Public Disclosure Provision.”); Bellitto v. Snipes, No. 16-cv-61474, 2018 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 103617, at *13 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2018) (“[E]lection officials must provide full \npublic access to all records related to their list maintenance activities, including their voter \nrolls.”). \n36.  The Public Disclosure Provision authorizes and entitles the public, which includes \nthe Foundation, to inspect and copy, or otherwise purchase and receive, a variety of list \nmaintenance data in the custody of the Defendants, including the voter registration list described \nin 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) as well as list maintenance data attached to individual registration files \nsuch as when and if the registrant was subjected to various list maintenance procedures.  \n37.  The Defendants are in violation of the NVRA because they did not allow the \nFoundation to inspect, copy, purchase or receive the requested list maintenance records.  Indeed, \nIllinois has deliberately made this impossible.  \n8 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 9 of 11 \n38.  By denying the Foundation the ability to obtain records it otherwise could obtain \nunder the Public Disclosure Provision of the NVRA, the Restricted Access Law, 10 ILCS 5/1A-\n25(4), conflicts with federal law. \n39.  Any Illinois statute, regulation, practice or policy that conflicts with, overrides, or \nburdens the NVRA, a federal statute, is preempted and superseded under Art. VI, cl. 2, the \nSupremacy Clause and Art. I, § 4, cl.1, the Elections Clause, of the Constitution of the United \nStates. \n40.  Illinois’s Restricted Access Law found in 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) is therefore \npreempted, invalid, and unenforceable. \n41.  The Foundation provided Defendants written notice of the NVRA violation \nalleged herein, thereby satisfying the NVRA’s pre-litigation notice requirement, 52 U.S.C. § \n20510(b)(1). Exhibit F. \n42.  Defendant has not cured his violation of the NVRA within the 20 days permitted \nby the NVRA. See 52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(2). \n43.  Defendant’s violation of the NVRA is causing the Foundation to suffer a concrete \ninformational injury because the Foundation does not have records and information to which it is \nentitled under federal law. FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 21 (1998) (“[A] plaintiff suffers an ‘injury \nin fact’ when the plaintiff fails to obtain information which must be publicly disclosed pursuant \nto a statute”). \n44.  By denying the Foundation the ability to obtain the requested voter registration \nlist, Illinois is impairing the Foundation’s ability to assess the accuracy of Illinois’s voter roll and \nto determine whether people from other states are voting in Illinois elections and vice versa. \n9 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 10 of 11 \n45.  Defendants’ violation of the NVRA is thus frustrating, impeding and harming the \nefforts of the Foundation to carry out its organizational mission. \n46.  The Foundation will continue to be injured by the Defendants’ violations of the \nNVRA unless and until the Defendants are enjoined from continuing to violate the law. \n47.  The Foundation is a person aggrieved by a violation of the NVRA, as set forth in \n52 U.S.C. § 20510(b)(1). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for a judgment: \n1.  Declaring that Defendants are in violation of Section 8(i) of the NVRA by \nrefusing to allow the Foundation to inspect and copy the requested list maintenance data and \nvoter registration list; \n2.  Declaring that Section 8(i) of the NVRA preempts and supersedes any \nrequirement or restriction in10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4), and any other Illinois statute, regulation, \npractice or policy that prevents the Foundation from inspecting and copying the requested list \nmaintenance data and voter registration list or that places restrictions on the use of Illinois’s list \nmaintenance data and voter registration lists;   \n3.  Ordering Defendants to produce to the Foundation the statewide list maintenance \ndata and voter registration list described in 10 ILCS 5/1A-25(4) or otherwise ordering \nDefendants to allow the Foundation to inspect and copy the list; \n4.  Permanently enjoining Defendants from denying requests to inspect similar list \nmaintenance data attached to voter registration lists in the future; \n5.  Ordering the Defendants to pay the Foundation’s reasonable attorney’s fees, \nincluding litigation expenses and costs, pursuant to 52 U.S.C. § 20510(c); and, \n10 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH   # 1    Page 11 of 11 \n6.  Granting the Foundation further relief that this Court deems just and proper. \nDated: July 27, 2020 \n            For the Plaintiff, Public Interest Legal Foundation:  \n \n/s/ A.

(PILF) filed its one-count complaint on July \n27, 2020. Doc 1. Plaintiff named SBE and Steve Sandvoss, in his official capacity as Executive \nDirector of SBE, as defendants. Plaintiff also named Kyle Thomas, in his official capacity as \nDirector of Voting and Registration Systems, and Cheryl Hobson, in her official capacity as \nDeputy Director of Voting and Registration Systems.  \nPlaintiff alleges that on October 16, 2019, it emailed a letter to Defendant Sandvoss seeking \n1 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 2 of 9 \nan electronic copy of Illinois’s statewide voter registration list pursuant to Section 8(i)(1) of the \nNational Voter Registration Act (NVRA). Id. at ¶ 18. Plaintiff alleges that on January 31, 2020, \nAttorney Sue Becker traveled to SBE’s Springfield office “to inspect the voter registration list on \n[SBE’s] computer . . . .” Id. at ¶ 26. Upon arrival, Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Becker was given \naccess to the public access voter registration database, but was told she could not “print a record, \nphotocopy or reproduce the screen, photograph the screen, print the screen or use a flash drive to \nobtain a copy of any sort of any information viewed.”  Id. at ¶ 27. Plaintiff also alleges Ms. Becker \nwas unable to view a full voter registration list, but rather, was allowed to view a searchable \ndatabase of voter registration information. See id. at ¶ 27-30. \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants allegedly violated Section 8(i)(1) of the NVRA because \nDefendants refused to allow Plaintiff to “inspect, copy, purchase, or receive the requested list \nmaintenance records.” Doc. 1 at ¶ 37.  \nDefendants  allegedly  denied  Plaintiff  the  opportunity  to  photocopy  certain  materials \npursuant to Section 1A-25 of the Illinois Election Code, which states, in pertinent part,  \nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of voter registration information, the disclosure \nof any portion of the centralized statewide voter registration list to any person or entity \nother than to a State or local political committee and other than to a governmental entity \nfor a governmental purpose is specifically prohibited except as follows: (1) subject to \nsecurity measures adopted by the State Board of Elections . . . any person may view the list \non a computer screen at the Springfield office of the State Board of Elections . . . but the \nperson viewing the list under this exception may not print, duplicate, transmit, or alter the \nlist . . . \n \n10 ILCS 5/1A-25 (West 2020).  \nPlaintiff alleges that Section 1A-25 is preempted by Section 8(i)(1) of the NVRA, which \nstates, \nEach State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall make available for public inspection \nand,  where  available,  photocopying  at  a reasonable  cost,  all  records  concerning  the \nimplementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the \n2 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 3 of 9 \naccuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters, except to the extent that such \nrecords relate to a declination to register to vote or to the identity of a voter registration \nagency through which any particular voter is registered. \n \n52 U.S.C. § 20507(i)(1) (West 2020).  \n  Plaintiff seeks declarations that Defendants violated Section 8(i) of the NVRA, and that \nSection 8(i) of the NVRA preempts Section 1A-25 of the Illinois Election Code. Doc. 1 at Prayer \nfor Relief, ¶ 1. Plaintiff also requests that the court order Defendants to produce the statewide list \nmaintenance and voter registration list. Id. at Prayer for Relief, ¶ 2. Plaintiff further requests that \nthis Court enjoin Defendants from denying further requests to inspect similar list maintenance data \nattached to voter registration lists. Id. at Prayer for Relief, ¶ 4. Finally, Plaintiff requests costs and \nfees pursuant to 52 U.S.C. § 20510(c). Id. at Prayer for Relief, ¶ 5. \nDefendant SBE seeks dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). \nDefendants Thomas and Hobson seek dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6). Defendant Sandvoss, Executive Director of the Illinois State Board of Elections, does \nnot join this motion.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a defendant may move for dismissal \nof a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). The district court may \nproperly look beyond the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint and view whatever evidence \nhas been submitted on the issue to determine whether in fact subject matter jurisdiction exists.” \nEzekiel v. Michel, 66 F.3d 894, 897 (7th Cir. 1995). \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) challenges the \ncomplaint’s sufficiency.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); Rodriguez v. Plymouth Ambulance Serv., 577 \nF.3d 816, 820-21 (7th Cir. 2009).  In ruling on a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6), the court accepts \n3 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 4 of 9 \nas true all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. \nMcCauley v. City of Chicago, 671 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir. 2011).  A complaint may not merely \nstate an “unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009). “A pleading that offers ‘labels and conclusions’ or a formulaic recitation of \nthe elements of a cause of action will not do.’” Id.  A complaint must contain allegations that “state \na claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Iqbal at 663, citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  However, legal conclusions and “conclusory allegations merely reciting \nthe elements of the claim are not entitled to this presumption of truth.” Id.  \nARGUMENT \n \nDefendants  SBE,  Kyle  Thomas,  and  Cheryl  Hobson  seek  dismissal  from  this  suit. \nPlaintiff’s  claims  against  Defendant  SBE  are  barred  by  the  Eleventh  Amendment.  Further, \nDefendants Kyle Thomas and Cheryl are not proper defendants in this lawsuit, as they do not have \nenforcement power pursuant to the NVRA.  \nI.  The SBE should be dismissed as a defendant due to the State of Illinois’ \nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.  \n  SBE should be dismissed as, barring voluntary waiver or congressional override, it cannot \nbe sued in federal court.  \nThe Eleventh Amendment confirms “the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity \nlimits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III.” Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, \n465 U.S. 89, 98 (1984). The Eleventh Amendment “guarantees that an unconsenting State is \nimmune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another \nState.” Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. Phx. Int'l Software, Inc., 653 F.3d 448, 457 (7th Cir. \n2011). A state may “claim immunity from suit in federal court and may be dismissed from a \n4 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 5 of 9 \nlitigation,” (Kroll v. Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Illinois, 934 F.2d 904, 907 (7th Cir. 1991)) absent \nvoluntary waiver or valid congressional override. See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 169 \n(1985). For the purpose of sovereign immunity, “[s]tate agencies are treated the same as states.” \nKroll, 934 F.2d at 907; see also Indiana Prot. & Advocacy Servs. v. Indiana Family & Soc. Servs. \nAdmin., 603 F.3d 365, 370 (7th Cir. 2010).  \nThe State of Illinois has not affirmatively consented to suit in this matter, and Plaintiff has \nnot so alleged. Further, Congress has not expressly overridden the State’s immunity for the NVRA, \nand Plaintiff has made no allegation of the same.  \nThe Supreme Court considers two factors “in order to determine whether Congress has \nabrogated the States’ sovereign immunity: “first, whether Congress has unequivocally expressed \nits intent to abrogate the immunity; and second, whether Congress has acted pursuant to a valid \nexercise of power . . . .” Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55 (1996) (internal \nquotations omitted). This Court’s analysis can begin and end at the first inquiry: Congress included \nno “clear legislative statement,” id., in the text of the NVRA which expresses an intent to abrogate \nthe Eleventh Amendment. Thus, the State’s immunity remains intact.  \n  SBE is an agency of the state of Illinois, and is thus immune from suit. ILL. CONST. art. III, \n§ 5; 10 ILCS 5/1A-1; see also Kuna v. Illinois Bd. of Elections, 821 F. Supp. 2d 1060, 1065 (S.D. \nIll. 2011); Smith v. Boyle, 959 F. Supp. 982, 986 (C.D. Ill. 1997), aff'd as modified, 144 F.3d 1060 \n(7th Cir. 1998). As the State has not consented to suit in this matter and Congress has not \noverridden the State’s immunity (and Plaintiff has not so alleged), SBE should be dismissed from \nthis lawsuit.  See e.g. Pub. Interest Legal Found. v. Boockvar, 431 F. Supp. 3d 553, 564 (M.D. Pa. \n2019) (dismissing Pennsylvania’s Bureau of Commissions, Elections and Legislation from NVRA \nsuit under Eleventh Amendment); Condon v. Reno, 913 F. Supp. 946, 959 (D.S.C. 1995) (“If the \n5 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 6 of 9 \nprivate plaintiffs in [one of the consolidated cases], were suing the state directly, they would be \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment.”). \n  The  Eleventh  Amendment’s  jurisdictional  bar applies to suits against State agencies \nregardless of the nature of relief sought. Missouri v. Fiske, 290 U.S. 18, 27 (1933) (“Expressly \napplying to suits in equity as well as at law, the Amendment necessarily embraces demands for \nthe enforcement of equitable rights and the prosecution of equitable remedies when these are \nasserted and prosecuted by an individual against a State”). That Plaintiff seeks equitable relief does \nnot prevent SBE from being dismissed from this suit. Smith, 959 F. Supp. at 986 (“Plaintiffs’ \nargument that the Eleventh Amendment is inapplicable to the case at bar because they are seeking \ninjunctive, rather than monetary, relief is not persuasive.”). \nII.  Defendants Thomas and Hobson are not proper parties to this litigation.  \n  Defendants Kyle Thomas and Cheryl Hobson should be dismissed from this suit as they \nare not proper parties. Plaintiff identifies Defendant Thomas as “the Director of Voting Systems \nand Registration” and states that he “has responsibility  for  maintaining the statewide  voter \nregistration list on behalf of the State Board of Elections.” Doc. 1 at ¶ 7. Defendant Hobson is \nidentified as “the Deputy Director of Voting and Registration within the Illinois State Board of \nElections.” Defendant Hobson, as Plaintiff alleges “is responsible for providing copies of the voter \nregistration list to those not restricted from receiving it.” Id. at ¶ 6. \n  Assuming Plaintiff’s allegations are accurate, purely  for the purpose of this  motion, \nDefendants  Thomas  and  Hobson  should  be  dismissed.  Plaintiff  has  not  alleged  that  either \ndefendant has the power to enforce the NVRA or that either defendant is responsible for the alleged \nharm suffered.  \n  The Division of Voting and Registration Systems, for which both Defendants Thomas and \nHobson work, “is responsible for the statewide Illinois Voter Registration System” including \n6 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 7 of 9 \n“training and support of internal and external applications” related to that system.1 The Division \nis “also responsible for all requests from registered political committees for computerized voter \ndata,” maintaining the “secure website where pre-election ballot request information is contained,” \nand maintaining “the Public Voter Search stations in our Springfield office, which are accessible \nduring  normal  business  hours”  subject  to  some  exceptions.2  The  Division  is  tasked  with \nrecommending for approval “voting systems for use in Illinois”, preparing and conducting of “pre-\nelection tests of voting systems”, preparing “referenda profiles for each election”, and analyzing \n“vote tabulation system computer operator logs from each regular election.”3  \n  The Division is not responsible for enforcing the NVRA and/or ensuring State compliance \nwith the disclosure provision of the NVRA; thus, the Division’s employees are not the proper \nparties to a suit alleging lack of compliance with the Act.  For this reason, Defendants Thomas and \nHobson should be dismissed from this suit.  \n   \n                                            \n1  Illinois  State  Board  of  Elections,  Division  of  Voting  and  Registration  Systems, \nhttps://www.elections.il.gov/AboutTheBoard/DivVotingAndRegistrationSystems.aspx?MID=25NH8xqBAV0%3d&\nT=637370054904902687 (last visited September 29, 2020). The Court can take judicial notice of publicly available \ninformation. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) (“The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute \nbecause it (1) is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily \ndetermined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”). \n2 Id. \n \n3 Id. \n7 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 8 of 9 \nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Defendants SBE, Thomas, and Hobson move \nthis Court to dismiss them as defendants from the instant action. \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \nILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, \nKYLE THOMAS, and CHERYL HOBSON, \n                     \n              Defendants, \n \n            KWAME RAOUL, Attorney General, \n            State of Illinois, \n \nKristina Dion (6312732)         Attorney for Defendants, \nThomas Ewick (#6279084)         \nAssistant Attorney General \n500 South Second Street \nSpringfield, Illinois 62701      By:   s/Kristina Dion  \n(217) 782-5819 Phone        KRISTINA DION \nE-Mail: kdion@atg.state.il.us       Assistant Attorney General \n              gls@atg.state.il.us \n \n   \n8 \n \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 10    Filed: 10/05/20    Page 9 of 9 \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS \n \nPUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL,      ) \nFOUNDATION, INC.        ) \n              ) \nPlaintiff,          ) \n              ) \nv.            )  3:20-cv-03190-SEM-TSH \n              ) \nSTEVE SANDVOSS, in his official Capacity as  ) \nExecutive Director of the Illinois State Board of   ) \nElections, KYLE THOMAS, in his official capacity ) \nas Director of Voting Systems and Registration,   ) \nCHERYL HOBSON in her official capacity as   ) \nDeputy Director of Voting and Registration, and the ) \nILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS,  ) \n              ) \n  Defendants.          ) \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \nI hereby certify that on October 5, 2020, the foregoing document, Memorandum of Law \nin Support of Defendants SBE, Thomas, and Hobson’s Motion to Dismiss, was electronically \nfiled with the Clerk of the Court using the CM/ECF system, which will send notification of such \nfiling to the following: \n \n  A.

Plaintiff’s submitted hours and hourly rates are each \nreasonable.  However, certain costs submitted are not recoverable.  \nPage 1 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 2 of 9 \nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s Motions (d/e 43 & 44) are GRANTED IN \nPART and DENIED IN PART. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff filed this suit on July 27, 2020.  In the Complaint, \nPlaintiff sought injunctive relief and a declaration that Defendants \nviolated Section 8(i) of the National Voter Registration Act, 52 U.S.C. \n§ 20507(i)(1), when Defendants refused to allow Plaintiff to inspect \nan/or copy Illinois’s statewide voter registration list.  Defendants \nThomas, Hobson, and the State Board of Elections filed a Motion to \nDismiss on October 5, 2020, while Defendant Sandvoss (now \nMatthews) filed an Answer on the same date.   \nAfter discovery, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment \non July 15, 2021.  Defendants filed a Cross-Motion for Summary \nJudgment on September 20, 2021.  All the filed motions were \nresponded to. \nOn March 8, 2022, the Court denied Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss and Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment \nwhile granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.  The Court \nordered Defendants to produce the statewide voter registration list \nand “pursuant to 52 U.S.C. § 20510(c), to pay the Foundation its \nPage 2 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 3 of 9 \nattorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses.”  Op. (d/e 37) pp. 26–27.  \nPlaintiff subsequently filed the present Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, \nCosts, and Expenses (d/e 43) and Supplemental Motion for the \nsame (d/e 44).  Defendants object in part to the Motions. \nII.  ANALYSIS \nUnder 52 U.S.C. § 20510(c), the Court “may allow the \nprevailing party” in a civil action brought under the National Voter \nRegistration Act “reasonable attorney fees, including litigation \nexpenses and costs.”  The amount of a fee award is discretionary.  \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983).  “[P]laintiffs may be \nconsidered ‘prevailing parties’ for attorney’s fees purposes if they \nsucceed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some \nof the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”  Id. at 433 \n(interpreting fee-shifting provision of 42 U.S.C. § 1988); see also \nNat’l Coal. for Students with Disabilities v. Bush, 173 F.Supp.2d \n1272, 1276 (N.D. Fla. 2001) (interpreting the NVRA as applying the \nsame fee-shifting formula as 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other civil rights \nstatutes).   \nThe prevailing party then bears the burden of showing that the \nrequested fees are “reasonable.”  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437.  “The \nPage 3 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 4 of 9 \nmost useful starting point for determining the amount of a \nreasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the \nlitigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.”  Id. at 433.  The \nresult is the lodestar amount of fees to be awarded.  However, the \naward may be reduced if the Court determines that the \ndocumentation of hours is inadequate or that the hours \ndocumented include “excessive, redundant, or otherwise \nunnecessary” time.  Id. at 433–34; Harper v. City of Chicago \nHeights, 223 F.3d 593, 605 (7th Cir. 2000).  While a district court \nmay strike problematic entries when a fee petition is vague or \ninadequately documented, an item-by-item accounting is an \nimpractical route for courts to take.  Harper, 223 F.3d at 605.   \nThe hourly rate must also be reasonable.  The party seeking \nfees bears the burden of proving the reasonableness of the hourly \nrate charged.  Spegon v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 175 F.3d 544, \n550 (7th Cir. 1999).  The reasonableness of an hourly rate is \ndetermined with reference to the market rate for the services \nrendered.  Id. at 555.  If the party seeking fees meets his burden, \nthe burden shifts to the opposing party to demonstrate why a lower \nrate should be awarded.  Id. (citing People Who Care v. Rockford \nPage 4 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 5 of 9 \nBd. of Educ., Sch. Dist. No. 205, 90 F.3d 1307, 1313 (7th Cir. \n1996)).  If the party seeking fees does not meet his burden, then the \nCourt \"has the authority to make its own determination of a \nreasonable rate.\"  Pickett v. Sheridan Health Care Center, 664 F.3d \n632, 640 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Uphoff v. Elegant Bath, Ltd., 176 F. \n3d 399, 409 (7th Cir. 1999)). \nThe market rate is “the rate that lawyers of similar ability and \nexperience in their community normally charge their paying clients \nfor the type of work in question.” Id. at 604 (quoting Spegon, 175 \nF.3d at 555).  “Community,” as the word is used for market rate \npurposes, means more than just the local market area; it also refers \nto “a community of practitioners.”  Jeffboat, LLC v. Dir., Off. of \nWorkers’ Comp. Programs, 553 F.3d 487, 490 (7th Cir. 2009).  This \nis especially true when, as here, “the subject matter of the litigation \nis one where the attorneys practicing it are highly specialized and \nthe market for legal services in that area is a national market.”  Id.  \nThe requesting party must submit evidence that the requested rate \nis reasonable, id., and that party bears the burden of proving the \nrate is reasonable.  Johnson v. GDF, Inc., 668 F.3d 927, 933 (7th \nCir. 2012).   \nPage 5 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 6 of 9 \nPlaintiff submits four affidavits, three of which are \naccompanied by exhibits, in support of its request for $114,565.25.  \nThe attached exhibits show hourly rates and hours expended on \nnumerous tasks performed by different attorneys over the lifetime of \nthis case.  Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s requested fees are \nunreasonable because the affidavits and exhibits include excessive \nhours and excessive hourly fees.  More specifically, Defendants \nargue that certain specific line items of Plaintiff’s request contain \nexcessive time for the stated work performed and that two of \nPlaintiff’s attorneys, Adams and Riordan, request hourly rates in \nexcess of what is reasonable within the community.   \nThe Court finds that the hours submitted by Plaintiff are \nreasonable.  While Defendants object to certain line items of \nPlaintiff’s submitted documentation, conducting a line-by-line \naccounting of largely uncontroversial documentation is impractical \nfor federal courts and is discouraged.  See Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. \n826, 838 (2011); see also Harper, 223 F.3d at 605.  Additionally, \nPlaintiff has already, through the exercise of “billing judgment,” \nreduced its requested hours by 33.9 hours, which is slightly more \nthan the 29.3 hours Defendants seek to exclude.  Hensley, 461 U.S. \nPage 6 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 7 of 9 \nat 437.  Accordingly, the Court sees no need to reduce Plaintiff’s \nstated hours any further and finds such time spent reasonable. \nPlaintiff’s submitted fees are also reasonable.  All but two \nattorneys for which Plaintiff requests fees assert an hourly rate of \n$350.  Local attorney Carl Draper testified that $350 per hour is a \nstandard rate for attorneys in a case such as this.  Draper Aff. (d/e \n43) Attach. 3, p. 2 (“the reasonable hourly fee for an attorney \npossessing the experience and skill [necessary] is $350 per hour or \nmore”).  While Defendants’ chief complaint concerns the rate \nsubmitted by the two other attorneys, Adams and Riordan, who \neach submitted an hourly rate of $525, Mr. Draper stated that $350 \nper hour was a floor.  Id.  Mr. Draper went on to state that “[t]here \nare a limited number of attorneys in this judicial district with the \nexperience needed for this litigation.”  Draper Aff. at p. 2.  Both \nAdams and Riordan bring extensive election law experience, each \nincluding experience in the Voting Section of the Department of \nJustice’s Civil Rights Division.  Lastly, the Court has awarded \nattorneys’ fees in other public interest cases at as much at $640 per \nhour.  See Moore v. Madigan, No. 11-cv-3134, docket entry 109 \n(C.D. Ill. July 21, 2015).  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff \nPage 7 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 8 of 9 \nhas carried its burden to show that the requested rate is \nreasonable.  Additionally, because Defendants have not put forth \nany evidence to refute Plaintiff’s evidence, the Court finds that \nDefendants have not carried their burden to show that a lower rate \nshould be awarded. \nHowever, Plaintiff’s submitted costs are reduced.  Recoverable \ncosts include fees of the clerk, fees for transcripts, fees for printing \nand witnesses, fees for copies of papers necessary for the case, \ndocketing fees, and compensation for experts.  28 U.S.C. § 1920.  \nExcluded from that list are attorney court admission fees.  Nilssen \nv. Osram Sylvania, Inc., Case No. 01 C 3585, 2007 WL 257711, at \n*1 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 23, 2007) (collecting cases).  Plaintiff’s submitted \ncosts are, therefore, reduced by $469, which is the total of the \nsubmitted court admission fees for attorneys Becker and Phillips. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and Expenses (d/e \n43) and Supplemental Motion for the same (d/e 44) are each \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The Court finds that \nPlaintiff’s submitted hours and hourly fees are reasonable.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds the fee award to reflect the following \nPage 8 of 9 \n\n3:20-cv-03190-SEM-KLM   # 49    Filed: 06/08/22    Page 9 of 9 \nlodestar calculation: 285.1 adjusted hours for attorneys Becker, \nPhillips, Johnson, Davis, and Svenson multiplied by a rate of $350 \nper hour in addition to 9.8 hours for attorney Svenson at a rate of \n$375 per hour and 17.6 hours for attorneys Adams and Riordan at \na rate of $525 per hour results in a total of $112,700.00 in \nattorneys’ fees.  Plaintiff’s submitted recoverable costs total \n$1,746.25.  Added together, the Court awards Plaintiff $114,446.25 \ntotal in costs and fees. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nENTERED: June 8, 2022. \nFOR THE COURT \n \n            /s/ Sue E.
