    "summary": "<p>This is a case about an individual being denied certification as a candidate for the Democratic nomination of Mayor of the City of Leland, Mississippi by the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of Leland, Mississippi.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 23, 2009, a citizen of the City of Leland, Mississippi filed a Petition for Judicial Review of Decision of the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of Leland, Mississippi in the Circuit Court of Washington County, Mississippi. Plaintiff sued the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of Leland, Mississippi under Mississippi Code Section 23-15-961(4). Represented by private counsel, Plaintiff claimed that (1) he was a qualified elector of the City of Leland, Mississippi; (2) that he met all of the qualifications for the Office of Mayor in the City of Leland, Mississippi; (3) that he had never been convicted of a felony or any crime; (4) that he properly filed qualifying papers to enter the Leland Democratic primary election for the Office of Mayor; and (5) that the reasons for his certification being challenged were a violation of Mississippi law and election code. For these reasons, Plaintiff sought an immediate hearing on his petition; a determination that he was legally qualified to have his name placed on the ballot as a candidate for Mayor in the Democratic primary in the City of Leland, Mississippi; an order directing his name to be placed on the ballot; and an award of attorney&rsquo;s fees and expenses. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendant sought removal of the case to federal court on the basis that the petition asserted, inter alia, a violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, thereby invoking federal jurisdiction pursuant to Title 28 USC Section 1331, 1343 and 1443. On April 1, 2009, the case was removed from the Circuit Court of Washington County, Mississippi to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. That same day, Defendant filed its Answer to Plaintiff&rsquo;s Petition. On April 5, 2009, Defendant filed its Amended Answer and Motion for Interim Relief Pursuant to Voting Rights Act of 1965 in which it sought interim relief authorizing it to enforce a new rule against Plaintiff that it planned to adopt on April 6, 2009. Specifically, Defendant planned to adopt a Rule Regarding Candidate Qualifications, that disqualifies a person for nomination as a candidate if they served as a member of a committee of a political party other than the Democratic Party, within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the municipal elections. Defendant stated that immediately after adoption of the rule, it would submit the aforementioned rule to the United States Justice Department for pre-clearance and that it planned to make its submission prior to the hearing in this matter. As Plaintiff was a member of the Republican Committee within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the municipal elections, Defendant requested that the Court, pending approval of the aforementioned submission, order interim relief authorizing the Defendant to enforce the new rule against plaintiff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2009, Defendant filed a Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Preclearance Decision. In its Motion, Defendant stated that it adopted a Rule Regarding Candidate Qualification on April 6, 2009, that provided that any candidate who served as a member of a committee of a political party, other than the Democratic Party, within the twelve-month period immediately preceding municipal elections may not qualify for nomination as a candidate of the Democratic Party in municipal elections in Leland, Mississippi. That same day, Defendant submitted the rule to the United States Attorney General for preclearance. Defendant sought to stay this proceeding pending preclearance, as the municipal primary elections were scheduled for May 5, 2009, and Defendant claimed Plaintiff&rsquo;s qualification as a candidate would constitute a fraud on prospective Democratic voters because he served as a member of the Leland, Mississippi Republican Executive Committee during this election cycle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2009, Plaintiff filed his Response to Defendant&rsquo;s Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Preclearance Decision. Plaintiff claimed (1) that he properly and timely filed his Qualifying Statement of Intent for a Candidate for Party Nomination for the Office of Mayor with the Leland City Clerk; and (2) that he paid the statutorily required $10.00 filing fee. Plaintiff argued that pursuant to the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;1973(c), no change in voting practices, standards, or procedures can be made effective until the change had been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, alternatively, precleared by the United States Attorney General. Plaintiff argued that even if the United States Attorney General precleared Defendant&rsquo;s new rule, that rule could only be applied prospectively, after preclearance, and could have no legal effect on the qualifications for certification that existed as of the qualifying deadline for the Leland Democratic Primary.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 2009, the Court convened a hearing on this matter pursuant to Rule 65 F.R.C.P. and/or the provisions of Miss. Code Ann. &sect;23-15-961(4). Prior to the hearing, Defendants requested a ruling on its motion to stay the instant proceeding pending preclearance. The Court denied said motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The Court then conducted an evidentiary hearing allowing for live testimony, documentary evidence, and the parties stipulations regarding the same. It also heard oral arguments from the parties. The Court then recessed the proceeding to consider its ruling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;After due consideration, the Court rendered a bench opinion in favor of Plaintiff. Finding that it had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, the Court noted that the parties had stipulated that Plaintiff met the statutory requirements contained at Miss Code Ann. Section 23-15-309 to qualify as a candidate for the office of Mayor in the City of Leland, Mississippi Democratic primary election and that Plaintiff testified that he would support the party nominee in the upcoming election. For compliance with Miss Code Ann. Section 23-15-575, a prospective loyalty oath is the sole requirement, and under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;23-15-309, the Court noted that party loyalty is not a recognized criterion for purposes of qualifying Plaintiff as a candidate for Mayor in the upcoming election. The Court also found that Miss. Code Ann. Section 23-15-575, as applied in this case, did not violate Defendant&rsquo;s right to freedom of association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or Article III, Sections 11 and 13 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890; and Miss. Code Ann. Section 23-15-309, as applied in this case, did not violate Defendant&rsquo;s right to freedom of association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or Article III, Sections 11 and 13 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890. The Court rejected Defendant&rsquo;s claim that placement of Plaintiff&rsquo;s name on the ballot as a Democratic candidate for Mayor was repugnant to the principles of free association recognized by the First and Fourteenth Amendments and held that the placement of Plaintiff&rsquo;s name on the Democratic Party&rsquo;s primary ballot as a statutorily qualified candidate did not place a significant burden on the Democratic Party&rsquo;s &ldquo;freedom to select a standard bearer who best represents the party&rsquo;s ideologies and preferences&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s right to &ldquo;broaden the base of public participation in and support for its activities.&rdquo; The Court determined that the State&rsquo;s interest in affording its citizens broad participation in the political process was sufficient to uphold the statutory procedure in question, and Defendant exceeded its statutory authority in refusing to qualify Plaintiff as a Democratic Party candidate for the office of Mayor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As to Defendant&rsquo;s Rule Regarding Qualification of Candidates, the Court noted that it did not exist on either March 6, 2009, the date on which Plaintiff filed his qualifying papers or on March 17, 2009, the date on which Defendant voted to deny Plaintiff certification on grounds of party disloyalty. It had not been precleared, and the Court lacked the authority to grant interim relief based upon said rule. To that end, the Court found that the recently adopted Rule Regarding Qualification of Candidates was unenforceable and therefore did not create a cognizable conflict with state election law and defendant&rsquo;s First and Fourteenth Amendment arguments stemming therefrom are not justiciable at this time. Based on the foregoing, the Court denied Defendant&rsquo;s (1) Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Preclearance, (2) Motion for Interim relief pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and (3) ore tenus Motion for Stay pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and granted Plaintiff&rsquo;s request for injunctive relief and required Defendant to place Plaintiff&rsquo;s name on the ballot for the May 5, 2009 Leland Municipal Democratic Primary Election.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 21, 2009, Defendant appealed the Court&rsquo;s decision and denial of its request for injunctive relief to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On April 29, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied appellants motion for stay pending appeal. On August 14, 2009, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss its appeal because the election which gave rise to this litigation had taken place and therefore the appeal was moot. On August 17, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal. The case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "A citizen of the City of Leland, Mississippi filed a Petition for Judicial Review of Decision of the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of Leland, Mississippi in the Circuit Court of Washington County, Mississippi. The plaintiff sued the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of Leland, Mississippi claiming that the defendant’s decision not to certify him as candidate for the Democratic nomination for the position of Mayor of the City of Leland, Mississippi violated Mississippi Code Section 23-15-961(4). The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. The Court ultimately granted the plaintiff injunctive relief, directing the defendant to put his name on the May 5, 2009 ballot for the Leland Municipal Democratic Primary Election as a Mayoral candidate. Defendant appealed but filed a Motion to Dismiss the appeal as moot because the election had passed. The appeal was dismissed.",

LOWE PLAINTIFF\nVS. CAUSE NO. 4:09-CV-00035-P-S  \nDEMOCRATIC MUNICIPAL EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF\nLELAND, MISSISSIPPI DEFENDANT\nMOTION TO MODIFY INJUNCTION\nPURSUANT TO RULE 62( C ) F.R.C.P. \nCOMES NOW, the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of\nLeland, Mississippi, by and through counsel, and  files this Motion to Modify Injunction\nPursuant to Rule 62 F.R.C.P. and in support thereof states the following:\n1. On April 16, 2009, this Court entered a Judgment requiring the Defendant to\nplace the name of the Plaintiff on the May 5, 2009 primary election ballot forthwith.\n2. On April 21, 2009, the Defendant filed an appeal of this Court’s April 16,2009\nJudgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  \n3. That since this Court’s April 16, 2009 Judgment, the Defendant has learned\nthat Mississippi law bars the Plaintiff from seeking election to the position of Mayor of\nLeland in the May 5, 2009 primary election and that the Defendant is lawfully required to\nenforce said prohibition.\n4. Pursuant to the provisions of §23-15-263(3), the County Executive\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 27 Filed: 04/23/09 2 of 6 PageID #: 273\nCommittees serve as “primary election officers” and they have  the powers and duties of\ngeneral election commissioners:\n(3) The primary election officers appointed by the executive committee of the\nparty shall have the powers and perform the duties, where not otherwise\nprovided, required of such officers in a general election, and any and every act\nor omission which by law is an offense when committed in or about or in\nrespect to such general elections, shall be an offense if committed in or about\nor in respect to a primary election; and the same shall be indictable and\npunishable in the same way as if the election was a general election for the\nelection of state and county officers, except as specially modified or otherwise\nprovided in this chapter.\n§23-15-263(3) Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended).\n5. Pursuant to the provisions of  §23-15-319 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as\namended) the preceding powers and duties of County Executive Committees are applicable\nto members of municipal executive committees:\nAll the provisions of this subarticle as far as practicable shall apply to\nand regulate primary elections for the nomination of elective municipal\noffices. Candidates for the nomination of such municipal offices shall\nfile with the clerk of the city, village or town, the affidavits and reports\nrequired of candidates for party nominations to any county or county\ndistrict office to be filed pursuant to this chapter.\n§23-15-319 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended).\n6. The provisions of § 23-15-217 Miss. Code Ann. (1972) include the\n following prohibition:\n(1) A commissioner of election of any county may be a candidate for\nany other office at any election held or to be held during the four-year\nterm for which he has been elected to the office of commissioner of\nelection or with reference to which he has acted as such; provided that\nhe has resigned from the office of election commissioner before\nJanuary 1 of the year in which he desires to seek the office. \n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 27 Filed: 04/23/09 3 of 6 PageID #: 274\n§ 23-15-217 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended)(emphasis added).  \n7. The Plaintiff has admitted that he served as a member of the Republican\nMunicipal Executive Committee for the City of Leland until his resignation on March 2,\n2009.\n8. Prohibitions applicable to election commissioners qualifying for office have\nbeen applied to executive committee members by the Mississippi Supreme Court.  See\nBreeland v. Mallett, 527 So.2d 629 (Miss. 1988).\n9. The Judgment of this Court entered on April 16, 2009 ordered that the\nDefendant add the Plaintiff’s name to the May 5, 2009 primary election ballot forthwith.\n10. Unless the Judgment of this Court is modified to allow the Defendant to bar\nthe Plaintiff from the May 5, 2009 ballot in accordance with the aforementioned Mississippi\nlaw, the Defendant, and its members who may vote for the Plaintiff in the primary election,\nwill effectively be disenfranchised because the Plaintiff will not be eligible to represent them\nin the general election.\n11. Rule 62( c) F.R.C.P. provides that, while an appeal from an injunction is\n pending, a District Court retains jurisdiction to suspend or modify the injunction.  Rule 62\n(c  ) F.R.C.P.\n12. The original intent of the Court’s April 16, 2009 Judgment was to insure\nthat Mississippi’s municipal election laws are complied with.  Modification of the April 16,\n2009 Judgment will help insure that said purpose is achieved.  Sierra Club v. Cedar Point\nOil Company, 73 F.3d 546 (5th Cir. 1996)(a Court may modify an injunction to achieve the\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 27 Filed: 04/23/09 4 of 6 PageID #: 275\noriginal purpose of the injunction if that purpose has not been fully achieved.)\n13. The injunction should be modified to permit the Defendant to discharge its\nduties and comply with the provisions of § 23-15-217 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended)\nand the related statutes.  \n14. Inasmuch as the Plaintiff is clearly barred as a candidate pursuant to § 23-15-\n217, he lacks any “irreparable injury” for the April 16, 2009 Judgment to protect.\n15. The original injunction granted on April 16, 2009 was too broad and didn’t\ntake into account other factors which might bar the Plaintiff from being a candidate in the\nDemocratic Primary.  The Court should modify the injunction to allow the Defendant to\ncomply with Mississippi law.\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Defendant prays that this Honorable\nCourt modify the April 16, 2009 Judgment by permitting the Defendant to discharge its\nduties and comply with the provisions of § 23-15-217 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended). \nDefendant prays for such other relief as may be appropriate.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this the 23rd day of April, 2009.\nMUNICIPAL DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE OF  LELAND, MISSISSIPPI\n     By:     /s/ Charles E.

      "text": "Case: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 1 of 10 PageID #: 87\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nGREENVILLE DIVISION\nJAMES W. LOWE PLAINTIFF\nVS. CAUSE NO. 4:09-CV-00035-P-S      \nDEMOCRATIC MUNICIPAL EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF\nLELAND, MISSISSIPPI DEFENDANT\nDEFENDANT’S TRIAL MEMORANDUM\nCOMES NOW, the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of Leland,\nMississippi, by and through counsel, and files this Trial Memorandum as follows:\nI. Introduction\nThe current Mississippi statute governing qualification procedures for municipal primary\nelections is unconstitutional.  Therefore, the “baseline” for determining whether there has been a\n“change” under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (“VRA”) should be either (1) the practice in place\nprior to the  covered jurisdiction becoming covered by the VRA or (2) the most recently precleared\npractice.  Both the practice in place prior to the covered jurisdiction becoming covered under the\nVRA and the most recently precleared practice permit the Defendant to act to disqualify the Plaintiff.\nThe Defendant is a municipal unit of the Democratic Party of the State of Mississippi.  See\nExhibit A, Democratic Party Constitution.  The Defendant is charged with the responsibility for\nqualifying Democratic Party candidates for office in the City of Leland, Mississippi pursuant to the\nprovisions of § 23-15-309 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended):\nUpon receipt of the proper fee and all necessary information, the proper executive\nPage 1 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 2 of 10 PageID #: 88\ncommittee shall then determine whether or not each candidate is a qualified elector,\nand whether any candidate has been convicted of any crime listed in Section 241,\nMississippi Constitution of 1890, or is a fugitive from justice from this state or any\nother state, and such charge upon which a candidate has fled has not been dismissed. \nIf the proper executive committee finds that a candidate is not a qualified elector or\nthat such candidate has been convicted of any crime listed in Section 241, Mississippi\nConstitution of 1890, and not pardoned nor has served his sentence, or is a fugitive\nfrom justice as aforesaid, then the name of such candidate shall not be placed upon\nthe ballot.\n§23-15-299(6) Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended. \nIn addition to Mississippi law, the Democratic Party Constitution grants the Defendant\ncertain powers to determine the qualifications of Democratic candidates:\nThe Municipal Executive Committee shall perform the same executive committee\nduties as are specified by law and this Constitution for other party units.  Each\nMunicipal Executive Committee shall be elected in the primary elections held for the\nnomination of candidates for municipal office and shall be elected by the same\nelection Districts by which the officers of the municipality are elected.  The names\nof all persons desiring to be a candidate for the nomination in the primary elections\nshall be furnished to the Municipal Executive Committee at least thirty days prior to\nthe first primary election.  The officers shall revise and prepare the poll books and\nballots, and the managers and other officials of the primary election committee shall\nbe appointed by the Municipal Executive Committee and the returns of said election\nshall be made to such Municipal Executive Committee.  \nArticle XI, Section 2 of the Constitution of the Mississippi Democratic Party.1  In addition, the\nprovisions of the Constitution of the Democratic Party of Mississippi provide that:\nNo candidate shall be certified to run in a Democratic Primary for any\noffice:\n(a) who has not met the statutory qualifications to run for such office;\n(b) who is not in accord with the principles and rules of the Democratic Party\nof Mississippi as set forth in the Constitution and bylaws and the standards\nor principles of the Party; and\n1The Constitution of the Democratic Party of the State of Mississippi has, for all times\nrelevant, been precleared.\nPage 2 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 3 of 10 PageID #: 89\n( c) who will not pledge to support the candidacy of all Party nominees at all\nlevels running in the same general election for which nomination is being\nsought.\nArticle XIII, Section 2(a)(b) and (c) of the Constitution of the Mississippi Democratic Party.\nThe Republican Party of Mississippi has municipal organizations which serve the same\nelection functions as the Democratic Party’s municipal organizations.  The Plaintiff, James Lowe, \nbecame an appointed member of the Republican Municipal Executive Committee for the City of\nLeland, Mississippi on February 20, 2005.  See Exhibit B.  On March 4, 2005, Mr. Lowe  qualified\nto run for a full four year term on the committee.  See Exhibit C.  He was elected to serve for a four\nyear term through the end of the municipal primary season in 2009.  \nOn March 2, 2009, Mr. Lowe purchased an ad in a local newspaper announcing his\nresignation as a member of the Leland Republican Executive Committee due to the fact that he was\na candidate for Mayor.  See Exhibit D.   His announcement did not disavow membership in the\nRepublican Party or profess membership in the Democratic Party.  Id.   On March 6, 2009, the\nqualifying deadline, Mr. Lowe filed a qualifying statement of intent to run as a Democratic candidate\nfor Mayor of Leland, Mississippi.  See Exhibit E.\nThe Mississippi yearly political cycle begins on January 1st.  See Article XIV, Section 257,\nMississippi Constitution of 1890.   By March 6, 2009, Mr. Lowe had spent almost the entire primary\npre-qualifying period as a member of the Leland Republican Executive Committee.  It was not until\n2:28 p.m. on March 6, 2009 that anyone learned that Mr. Lowe planned to qualify as a Democrat. \nId.\nThe current Mayor of the City of Leland, a Democrat, had also filed qualifying papers to run\nfor re-election.  After learning that Mr. Lowe had filed qualifying papers to run as a Democrat, she\nPage 3 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 4 of 10 PageID #: 90\ninitiated a challenge to his qualifications.  A hearing was subsequently held and the Defendant\ndecided not to qualify Mr. Lowe on the basis that he “violated the Democratic Constitution of the\nState of Mississippi by serving on the Leland Republican Municipal Executive Committee and\nsupporting the Republican Party.”2  See Exhibit F.  Being aggrieved by the decision of the Defendant,\nMr. Lowe filed the instant lawsuit seeking to overturn the ruling of the Defendant.\nI. State Law.\nPursuant to the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, the legislature is charged with the duty to\nmake laws to insure fairness in party primary elections, conventions, or other methods of naming\nparty candidates.   See Article XII, Section 247, Mississippi Constitution of 1890.  The Mississippi\nConstitution of 1890 also guarantees the rights of the Defendant to freedom of association and\nfreedom of speech.  See Article III, Sections 11 and 13, Mississippi Constitution of 1890. \nArticle III, Section 11 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 provides for the right to\nFreedom of Association:\nThe right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government on any\nsubject shall never be impaired.\nArticle III, Section 11 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.  The provisions of Article III, Section\n13 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 provides for the right to freedom of speech:\nThe freedom of speech and of the press shall be held sacred; and in all prosecutions\nfor libel the truth may be given in evidence, and the jury shall determine the law and\nthe facts under the direction of the court; and if it shall appear to the jury that the\nmatter charged as libelous is true, and was published with good motives and for\njustifiable ends, the party shall be acquitted.\n2The decision to disqualify Mr. Lowe was based upon the Defendant’s authority (under\nthe Mississippi Democratic Party Constitution) not to qualify individuals who it deemed were not\nin accord with the principles and rules of the Democratic Party of Mississippi as set forth in the\nConstitution and bylaws and the standards or principles of the Party.\nPage 4 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 5 of 10 PageID #: 91\nArticle III, Section 13 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.  The rights to freedom of speech and\nfreedom of association under the United States Constitution are contained in the First Amendment\nto the United States Constitution:\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting\nthe free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the\nright of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a\nredress of grievances.\nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The provisions of the First Amendment apply\nto the states pursuant to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.\nThe Mississippi Constitution and the United States Constitution combine to provide\nsignificant protection for the Defendant.  These provisions require the State of Mississippi to allow\nthe Defendant to have a meaningful role in the selection of its nominees for public office.   The\nUnited States Supreme Court has held that a political party’s right to exclude is central to its freedom\nof association and is never more important than in the process of selection of its nominees. \nWashington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 128 S.Ct. 1184 (2008).   \nIn accordance with its duties under the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 and consistent with\nstate and federal constitutional law, the legislature enacted legislation to insure fairness in elections\nand to insure the Defendant’s rights to freedom of association under the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and Article III, Sections 11 and 13, Mississippi\nConstitution of 1890.   See Kucinich v. Texas Democratic Party, ___ F.3d            , 2009 WL 755393\n(C.A.5 Tex);  Ray v. Blair, 343 U.S. 214, 72 S.Ct. 654, 96 L.Ed. 894 (1952).  \nUnder Section 3129 of the Mississippi Code of 1942, the legislature provided:\nPage 5 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 6 of 10 PageID #: 92\nNo person shall be eligible to participate in any primary election unless he has been\nin accord with the party holding such primary within the two preceding years, and is\nin accord with the statement of the principles of the party holding such primary,\nwhich principles shall have been declared by the state convention of the party holding\nthe primary, and unless he is not excluded from such primary by any regulation of the\nstate executive committee of the party holding such primary; provided however, that\nnothing herein is intended or shall ever be understood as applying to elections of\nPresident or Vice-President of the United States, wherein votes may be cast entirely\nwithout regard to party lines and within any penalty for so doing.\nThe aforementioned section was repealed by Chapter 506, Laws of 1970.  The following law\nwas subsequently enacted:\nUpon receipt of the proper fee and all necessary information, the proper executive\ncommittee shall then determine whether or not each candidate is a qualified elector,\nand whether any candidate has been convicted of any crime listed in Section 241,\nMississippi Constitution of 1890, or is a fugitive from justice from this state or any\nother state, and such charge upon which a candidate has fled has not been dismissed. \nIf the proper executive committee finds that a candidate is not a qualified elector or\nthat such candidate has been convicted of any crime listed in Section 241, Mississippi\nConstitution of 1890, and not pardoned nor has served his sentence, or is a fugitive\nfrom justice as aforesaid, then the name of such candidate shall not be placed upon\nthe ballot.\n§23-15-299(6) Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended.  The statutory source notes indicate that the\nUnited States Attorney General interposed no objection to the aforementioned language.  It is unclear\nwhy the protections afforded to the Defendant were repealed.  The official position of the Attorney\nGeneral of the State of Mississippi is that §23-15-299(6) Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended, is\nthe current practice in the State of Mississippi and that any action taken to apply a qualification not\ncontained within the confines of §23-15-299(6) Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended constitutes\na “change” for Voting Rights Act purposes and requires preclearance.  See Mississippi Attorney\nGeneral’s opinion to Honorable Billy R. Nicholson, 2007 WL 852249, (Miss. A.G.) January 29,\n2007.\nPage 6 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 7 of 10 PageID #: 93\nMississippi’s statutory procedure for qualifying primary election candidates denies the\nDefendant the right to have a meaningful role in the qualification process.  The best evidence of a\ncandidate’s identification with the principles supported by the Defendant is the past behavior of the\ncandidate.  If the Defendant is prohibited from taking past behavior into account in the qualification\nprocess, it cannot exercise its rights to freedom of association and freedom of speech.  \nThe provisions of §23-15-299(6) are not narrowly tailored to protect the interests of the state\nin maintaining fair and open elections.  The legislative repeal of Section 3129 took away the\nDefendant’s rights.  To the extent that §23-15-299(6) Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended,\nviolates the rights of Defendant under Article III, Sections 11 and 13 of the Mississippi Constitution\nof 1890 and under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, its\nenforcement should be prohibited and Mississippi should be forced to comply with the provisions\nof the previously repealed Section 3129.  Alternatively, this Court should fashion a remedy for the\nDefendant. \nII. Federal Law and The Voting Rights Act.\nThe VRA was enacted to enforce the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.   Under Section 5 of the VRA, all election  changes in a covered jurisdiction\nmust be precleared by the Attorney General of the United States or a three judge district court in the\nDistrict of Columbia before they can be implemented.  The City of Leland, Mississippi is a covered\nlocation under the VRA.\nIII. Is the enforcement of the pre-cleared Democratic Party Constitution or the prior\nprovisions of Section 3129  a “change” under the Voting Rights Act?\nIt is undisputed that the Democratic Party Constitution has been precleared under the\nPage 7 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 8 of 10 PageID #: 94\nprovisions of the VRA.   It was precleared after  §23-15-299(6) Mississippi Code of 1972.   The\nprovisions of the Democratic Party Constitution are consistent with the power previously conferred\nto political parties in Mississippi pursuant to Section 3129.3   The repeal of Section 3129 did not\nchange the authority of political parties to police their nominees.  The repeal eliminated that\nauthority under Mississippi law.  Based upon information and belief, the repeal was not expressly\nprecleared pursuant to the VRA.  The repeal was reportedly precleared as a part of the re-codification\nof Mississippi laws which resulted in the Mississippi Code of 1972.4   An unconstitutional statute\nshould be ignored for “baseline” purposes under the VRA.   See Riley v. Kennedy, 128 S.Ct.1970,\n1985 ( 2008)(Elections are sometimes permitted to proceed despite legal challenge and “practice”\nmay constitute “baseline” even if it is illegal under state law).\nIV. Is the enforcement of the non-precleared Rule Adopted By The Democratic Party\nExecutive Committee a “change” under the Voting Rights Act?\nThe Defendant concedes that the enforcement of the non-precleared rule adopted by the\nDefendant constitutes a “change’ under the provisions of the VRA.  The Defendant has submitted\nthe Rule for preclearance.  The Defendant submits that the election should go forward while\npreclearance is pending.  Equity supports the right of the Defendant to select candidates of its choice\nto carry the Democratic Party banner.  To grant injunctive relief to the Plaintiff would violate the\nDefendant’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\nArticle 3, Sections 11 and 13 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.  The Defendant has a critical\n3Section 3129 was in effect prior to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n4This representation is made on the basis of information verbally obtained from the Office\nof the Attorney General.  The historical documents evidencing the sequence of events are not\navailable to the Defendant in time for this hearing.\nPage 8 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 9 of 10 PageID #: 95\ninterest in protecting the integrity of its candidate nomination process.  See California Democratic\nParty v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567 (2000)( In no area is the political association’s right to exclude more\nimportant than in the process of selecting its nominee).  \nThe Court should protect the Defendant from Republican candidates and/or independent\ncandidates whose candidacies may be prompted by “short range political goals, pique or personal\nquarrel” rather than party identification with the Defendant.  Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 736\n(1974).  The Court should also protect the Defendant from Republican and/or independent\ncandidates whose goal is to capture and bleed off votes in the primary election or general election\nthat might well go to another party candidate. Id. The Plaintiff’s recent relationship with the\nRepublican Party, his service on the Republican Municipal Executive Committee during this election\nyear and his last minute filing of Democratic qualifying papers all support the Defendant’s request\nto deny the Plaintiff injunctive relief and grant the Defendant relief.  This Court should allow the\nelection to go forward and should stay the disposition of this case pending preclearance. \nV. Prayer for Relief.\nWHEREFORE, the Defendant prays that this Honorable Court dismiss the Plaintiff’s\nComplaint, deny the Plaintiff injunctive relief, grant Defendant interim relief, allow the Defendant\nto enforce its new rule preventing officers of another political party from qualifying as candidates\nin the Leland, Mississippi  Democratic primary  until they have ended their affiliation with the other\npolitical party for the  proscribed period of time in the new rule.  If the Defendant has prayed for\nwrong or improper relief, the Defendant hereby prays that this Honorable Court grant the Defendant\nsuch additional relief as is appropriate based upon the facts and the law applicable to this case.\nSubmitted this the 7th day of April, 2009.\nPage 9 of  10\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 9 Filed: 04/07/09 10 of 10 PageID #: 96\nRespectfully submitted,\nMUNICIPAL DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE OF  LELAND, MISSISSIPPI\n     By:     /s/ Charles E.

LOWE PLAINTIFF\nVS. CAUSE NO. 4:09-CV-00035-P-S  \nDEMOCRATIC MUNICIPAL EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF\nLELAND, MISSISSIPPI DEFENDANT\nDEFENDANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL\nMEMORANDUM\nCOMES NOW, the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of\nLeland, Mississippi, by and through counsel, and files this Supplemental Memorandum as\nfollows:\nI.  Defendant May Enforce § 23-15-575 Miss. Code Ann (1972, as amended)\nand/or Should Not Be Required To Qualify Lowe In\nViolation of Defendant’s Constitutional Right To Freedom of Association\nAs stated below Mississippi law recognizes that  municipal executive committees are \nstand alone entities for purposes of applying Mississippi’s election laws.  The Democratic\nParty of the State of Mississippi recognizes that municipal executive committees are stand\nalone entities of the party for performance of quasi-governmental duties on the municipal\nlevel:\nThe  Municipal  Executive  Committee  shall  perform  the  same  executive\ncommittee duties as are specified by law and this Constitution for other party\nunits.  Each Municipal Executive Committee shall be elected in the primary\nelections held for the nomination of candidates for municipal office and shall\nPage 1 of  9\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 18 Filed: 04/08/09 2 of 25 PageID #: 118\nbe  elected  by  the  same  election  Districts  by  which  the  officers  of  the\nmunicipality are elected.  The names of all persons desiring to be a candidate\nfor the nomination in the primary elections shall be furnished to the Municipal\nExecutive Committee at least thirty days prior to the first primary election. \nThe officers shall revise and prepare the poll books and ballots, and the\nmanagers and other officials of the primary election committee shall be\nappointed by the Municipal Executive Committee and the returns of said\nelection shall be made to such Municipal Executive Committee.  \nArticle XI, Section 2 of the Constitution of the Mississippi Democratic Party.1 \nThe Plaintiff has the burden of proof.  He submits that the aforementioned conduct\nshould be disregarded and that he should be able to merely state a hypocritical promise to\nsupport Democratic candidates in the future and escape the prohibition of § 23-15-575 Miss.\nCode Ann (1972, as amended).  If the Plaintiff’s interpretation of the law is correct, then the\nprotection afforded by § 23-15-575 amounts to no protection at all.\nIf the Court rules that § 23-15-575 , is unenforceable by the Defendant, it means that\nthe statute is unconstitutional:\nAs should be evident, the matter before the court is on one level quite\ncomplicated.  However, once the penumbra of arguments is cleared away, the\ncore matter for the court to decide is quite simple: Without regard to who can\nand  should  change  what,  either  §  23-15-575's  primary  system\nunconstitutionally  infringes  on  Mississippi  political  parties’  First\nAmendment  right  to  disassociate  non-members  from  their  nomination\nprocess or it does not. (emphasis added) \nThe court concludes that the plaintiffs have met their burden in demonstrating\nthat the character and magnitude of their asserted injury rises to the level of an\nunconstitutional infringement on their First Amendment right to disassociate.\n1The Constitution of the Democratic Party of the State of Mississippi has, for all times\nrelevant, been precleared.\nPage 2 of  9\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 18 Filed: 04/08/09 3 of 25 PageID #: 119\nMississippi State Democratic Party v. Barbour, 2007 WL 2071800, N.D. Miss. (2007),\nreversed by Mississippi Democratic Party v. Barbour, 529 F.3d 538 (5th Cir. 2008).\nII.  Lowe’s Conduct Irrefutably Evidences That He Will Not Support\nDemocratic Party Nominees. \nThe Plaintiff, James Lowe, became an appointed member of the Republican Municipal\nExecutive Committee for the City of Leland, Mississippi on February 20, 2005.  See Exhibit\nA.  On March 4, 2005, Mr. Lowe  qualified to run for a full four year term on the committee. \nSee Exhibit B.  He was elected to serve for a four year term through the end of the municipal\nprimary season in 2009.  \nWhile serving as a member of the Republican Executive Committee and presumably\npreparing to qualify as a candidate in the Democratic primary election, Mr. Lowe signed a\nqualifying petition for an Independent candidate  to run against an incumbent Democratic\ncandidate for alderman in the City of Leland for the general election to be held in June, 2009. \nSee Exhibit C.  Mr. Lowe’s signature was a necessary requirement for the qualification of\nthe Independent candidate to be able to run against the lone Democratic nominee.\nOn March 2, 2009, Mr. Lowe purchased an ad in a local newspaper announcing his\nresignation as a member of the Leland Republican Executive Committee due to the fact that\nhe was a candidate for Mayor.  See Exhibit D.   His announcement did not disavow\nmembership in the Republican Party or profess membership in the Democratic Party.  Id.  \nOn March 6, 2009, the qualifying deadline, Mr. Lowe filed a qualifying statement of intent\nPage 3 of  9\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 18 Filed: 04/08/09 4 of 25 PageID #: 120\nto run as a Democratic candidate for Mayor of Leland, Mississippi.  See Exhibit E. \nThe Mississippi yearly political cycle begins on January 1st.  See Article XIV, Section\n257, Mississippi Constitution of 1890.   By March 6, 2009, Mr. Lowe had spent almost the\nentire  primary  qualifying  period  as  a  member  of  the  Leland  Republican  Executive\nCommittee.  It was not until 2:28 p.m. on March 6, 2009 that anyone learned that Mr. Lowe\nplanned to qualify as a Democrat.  Id.\nSince filing the qualifying papers, Mr. Lowe has engaged in a continuous public attack\non the Defendant and Democratic elected officials in Leland, Mississippi.  See Exhibit F. \nThe published views of the Plaintiff leave little doubt that he will ever support certain\nindividuals if they are re-elected as Democratic party nominees.\nThe provisions of § 23-15-575 Miss. Code Ann (1972, as amended) provide:\nNo person shall be eligible to participate in any primary election unless he\nintends to support the nominations made in the primary in which he participates.\n§ 23-15-575 Miss. Code Ann (1972, as amended).  The Defendant humbly submits that the\naforementioned  evidence  proves  that  Mr.  Lowe  has  no  intention  of  supporting  the\nDemocratic nominees for municipal office in this election cycle and he should be barred from\nqualifying as a candidate for the Leland, Mississippi May, 2009 Democratic primary election\nin accordance with § 23-15-575.  \nThe Defendant is a municipal unit of the Democratic Party of the State of Mississippi. \nSee Exhibit A, Democratic Party Constitution.  The Nominations Section of the election code\noutlines the primary election scheme.  Under §23-15-291 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as\nPage 4 of  9\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 18 Filed: 04/08/09 5 of 25 PageID #: 121\namended):\nAll nominations for state, district, county and county district officers made by the\ndifferent parties of this state shall be made by primary elections.  All primary elections\nshall be governed and regulated by the primary election laws of the state in force at\nthe time the primary election is held.   \n§23-15-291 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended).  The Defendant is charged with the\nresponsibility for qualifying Democratic Party candidates for office in the City of Leland,\nMississippi.   Pursuant to the provisions of § 23-15-299(6) Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as\namended):\nUpon receipt of the proper fee and all necessary information, the proper\nexecutive committee shall then determine whether or not each candidate is a\nqualified elector, and whether any candidate has been convicted of any crime\nlisted in Section 241, Mississippi Constitution of 1890, or is a fugitive from\njustice from this state or any other state, and such charge upon which a\ncandidate has fled has not been dismissed.  If the proper executive committee\nfinds that a candidate is not a qualified elector or that such candidate has been\nconvicted of any crime listed in Section 241, Mississippi Constitution of 1890,\nand not pardoned nor has served his sentence, or is a fugitive from justice as\naforesaid, then the name of such candidate shall not be placed upon the ballot.\n§23-15-299(6) Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended.  Section 23-15-309 Mississippi Code\nof 1972, as amended provides:\nNomination for elective municipal office to be made at primary election; \nfee requirements; determination of candidate’s qualifications.\n(1) Nominations for all municipal officers which are elective shall be made at\na primary election, or elections, to be held in the manner prescribed by law. All\npersons desiring to be candidates for the nomination in the primary elections\nshall first pay Ten Dollars ($10.00) to the clerk of the municipality, at least\nsixty (60) days prior to the first primary election, no later than 5:00 p.m. on\nsuch deadline day.\nPage 5 of  9\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 18 Filed: 04/08/09 6 of 25 PageID #: 122\n(2)  The  fee  paid  pursuant  to  subsection  (1)  of  this  section  shall  be\naccompanied by a written statement containing the name and address of the\ncandidate, the party with which he is affiliated, and the office for which he is\na candidate.\n(3) The clerk shall promptly receipt the payment, stating the office for which\nthe person making the payment is running and the political party with which\nsuch person is affiliated. The clerk shall keep an itemized account in detail\nshowing the time and date of the receipt of such payment received by him,\nfrom whom such payment was received, the party with which such person is\naffiliated and for what office the person paying the fee is a candidate. The\nclerk shall promptly supply all necessary information and pay over all fees so\nreceived to the secretary of the proper municipal executive committee. Such\nfunds may be used and disbursed in the same manner as is allowed in Section\n23-15-299 in regard to other executive \ncommittees.  \n(4) Upon receipt of the above information, the proper municipal executive\ncommittee shall then determine whether each candidate is a qualified elector\nof the municipality, and of the ward if the office sought is a ward office, shall\ndetermine whether each candidate either meets all other qualifications to hold\nthe office he is seeking or presents absolute proof that he will, subject to no\ncontingencies, meet all qualifications on or before the date of the general or\nspecial  election  at  which  he  could  be  elected  to  office.  The  executive\ncommittee shall determine whether the candidate has taken the steps necessary\nto qualify for more than one (1) office at the election. The committee also shall\ndetermine whether any candidate has been convicted of any felony in a court\nof this state, or has been convicted on or after December 8, 1992, of any\noffense in another state which is a felony under the laws of this state, or has\nbeen convicted of any felony in a federal court on or after December 8, 1992.\nExcepted from the above are convictions of manslaughter and violations of the\nUnited States Internal Revenue Code or any violations of the tax laws of this\nstate unless such offense also involved misuse or abuse of his office or money\ncoming into his hands by virtue of his office. If the proper municipal executive\ncommittee finds that a candidate either (a) does not meet all  qualifications to\nhold the office he seeks and fails to provide absolute proof, subject to no\ncontingencies, that he will meet the qualifications on or before the date of the\ngeneral or special election at which he could be elected, or (b) has been\nconvicted of a felony as described in this subsection and not pardoned, then the\nname of such candidate shall not be placed upon the ballot. If the executive\nPage 6 of  9\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 18 Filed: 04/08/09 7 of 25 PageID #: 123\ncommittee determines that the candidate has taken the steps necessary to\nqualify for more than one (1) office at the election, the action required by\nSection 23-15-905, shall be taken.\n(5) Where there is but one (1) candidate, the proper municipal executive\ncommittee when the time has expired within which the names of candidates\nshall be furnished shall declare such candidate the nominee.\nFinally, §23-15-319 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended) is a catch-all statute which\nprovides that all  provisions of the election code shall apply to municipal election offices:\nAll the provisions of this subarticle [Chapter 13, Title 15 (Election Code)] as\nfar  as  practicable  shall  apply  to  and  regulate  primary  elections  for  the\nnomination of elective municipal offices. Candidates for the nomination of\nsuch municipal offices shall file with the clerk of the city, village or town, the\naffidavits and reports required of candidates for party nominations to any\ncounty or county district office to be filed pursuant to this chapter.\n§23-15-319 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended).  Finally, municipal and county committees\ncan sue and be sued in connection with their exercise of election related functions.   See\nJefferson Davis County Democratic Executive Committee v. Davies, 912 So.2d 837 (Miss.\n2005); Hinds County Democratic Executive Committee v. Muirhead, 259 So.2d 692 (Miss.\n1972).  The Defendant is an organization existing under the laws of the State of Mississippi\nand should not be prohibited from asserting Constitutional rights on behalf of its members.\nWHEREFORE, the Defendant prays that this Honorable Court dismiss the Plaintiff’s\nComplaint, deny the Plaintiff injunctive relief, grant Defendant interim relief, allow the\nDefendant to enforce its new rule preventing officers of another political party from\nqualifying as candidates in the Leland, Mississippi  Democratic primary  until they have\nPage 7 of  9\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 18 Filed: 04/08/09 8 of 25 PageID #: 124\nended their affiliation with the other political party for the  proscribed period of time in the\nnew rule.  If the Defendant has prayed for wrong or improper relief, the Defendant hereby\nprays that this Honorable Court grant the Defendant such additional relief as is appropriate\nbased upon the facts and the law applicable to this case.\nSubmitted this the 8th day of April, 2009.\nRespectfully submitted,\nMUNICIPAL DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE OF  LELAND, MISSISSIPPI\n     By:     /s/ Charles E.

She will stoop to any level, \nand stop at nothing in order to keep her hands in the till and continue to do the illegal things that \nshe is so noted for. She hand picked her cronies to makeup the illegal Leland Executive \nDemocratic Committee who was not only incapable of conducting a meeting, but did not have a \nclue as to what an Attorney Generals Opinion was. After learning that they were trying to remove \nmy name from the ballot, we obtained an opinion from the Attorney Generals Office that came \nduring the illegal meeting held by her cronies. After obtaining the Attorneys GeneralsOpinion which \nwas very clear, I read it to the committee very slowly to make sure that they would understand the \nwell written, word friendly, clear, and precise document. I also gave them a copy so that they could \ngo back and review it again. Apparently the document was beyond their grasp, even our brilliant \nMayors understanding of the document came into play when she stated to the committee that that \nwas the Attorney Generals personal opinion, and he can have one like anybody else. It is with this \nkind of mentality, and leadership that has found its way into our local government that keeps the \nboard argumentive, polarized, frustrated, and struggling to stay afloat. If you would like to review \nthe Attorney General’s Opinion you will be able to find it in last weeks Leland Progress dated \nTuesday, March 19, 2009 on page four. It is sad that the Mayor who has very little understanding \nuse people like those on the so called illegal Leland Democratic Executive Committee who do not \nhave any inkling as to what they are doing, to do her dirty illegal, underhanded work. What they do \nnot understand about me is that I am two steps ahead of them at all times and, I say to those who \nserve on her illegal Committee. I can’t perceive you with such atool, but a mind is a terrible thing to \nwaste. \n  \n  \n  \nPosted by Watch Dog at 15:17:02 | Permanent Link | Comments (0) |   \nWednesday | March 11, 2009 \nMAYOR ALLEGEDLY CAUGHT WITH HAND IN \nCOOKIE JAR \nIt is a sad fact, and a disgrace that the Board of Aldermen would see fit to allow Mayor Barbara \nBrooks to run for public office with the cloud of alleged unauthorized check writing that number into \nthe thousands of dollars hanging over her head without being resolved. It is alleged that Mayor \nBrooks, Alderwoman Brooks, and other senior staff members, and/or department heads took trips \nto the Gulf Coast, and other places, lived in luxury hotels without the knowledge, or permission of \nthe Board. It is mystifying to me that the Board would allow these wrong doings to continue without \nrectifying the situation. I think that it is incumbent upon this Board to take immediate action to \nrectify these atrocities before moving forward. Leland has had too many things swept under the \nrug, or just blatantly disregarded by this administration. I can assure you that this is not a witch \nhunt, but Leland deserves better and there have been too many irregularities committed by this \nadministration without answers, and/or corrections  If Mayor Brooks has nothing to hide she should \ncome forward and demand an audit to clear her of the accusation of alleged fraud without delay.

LOWE                PETITIONER \n \nV.              CAUSE NO.:  4:09CV035-P-S \n \nDEMOCRATIC MUNICIPAL EXECUTIVE \nCOMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF LELAND, \nMISSISSIPPI                 DEFENDANT \n \n \n \n  PETITIONER’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO  \nSTAY PROCEEDINGS PENDING PRECLEARANCE DECISION \n \nCOMES NOW, Petitioner James W. Lowe, by and through the undersigned \ncounsel, and files this, his response to Defendant’s “Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending \nPreclearance Decision,” stating as follows: \nThe following facts are undisputed: \n1.  Petitioner is an African-American citizen of the City of Leland, Mississippi, is \na qualified elector of the City of Leland, is fully qualified to hold the office of Mayor of that \nCity and has never been convicted of a felony. \n2.  On March 6, 2009, Petitioner properly and timely filed with the Leland City \nClerk his “Qualifying Statement of Intent for a Candidate for Party Nomination for the \nOffice of Mayor.”  He also paid the statutorily required $10.00 filing fee.  Pursuant to \nstatute, the City Clerk forwarded Petitioner’s Qualifying Statement and filing fee to \nDefendant Municipal Democratic Executive Committee of Leland, Mississippi.  \n3.  On March 13, 2009, Committee Chairman Danny Caldwell hand delivered to \nPetitioner a letter, also dated March 13, 2009, advising Petitioner that, on March 11, 2009, \nthe Committee had received a petition challenging his certification as a candidate for \n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 17 Filed: 04/08/09 2 of 4 PageID #: 114\nMayor in the May 5, 2009 Democratic primary.  The letter further advised Petitioner that a \nhearing would be held the following Monday, March 16, 2009. \n4.  A hearing was held on March 16th, after which the Committee recessed to \nconsider its decision.  On March 18, 2009, Petitioner received from the Committee a letter \ndated March 17, 2009, advising him that “[t]he challenge [to his certification] was based on \nclaims that [Petitioner] violated the Democratic Constitution of the State of Mississippi by \nserving on the Leland Republican Municipal Executive Committee and supporting the \nRepublican Party.”  The letter further advised Petitioner that the Committee had voted \nunanimously to deny his certification as a Democratic candidate for Mayor. \nAccordingly, either on March 16th or March 17th the Committee voted unanimously \nto refuse to certify Petitioner for the reasons stated in the March 17th letter.  There is no \ndispute that Petitioner meets the statutory qualifications set out in Miss. Code. Ann. §23-\n15-309. \n5.  On April 6, 2009, exactly one month after Petitioner filed his Qualifying \nStatement, and either 19 or 20 days after the Committee refused to certify Petitioner, the \nCommittee met and adopted a “Rule Regarding Candidate Qualification.”  The text of this \nnew rule is as follows: \nAny individual who has served as a member of a committee of a political party, \nother than the Democratic party, within the 12 month period immediately preceding \nmunicipal elections may not qualify for nomination as a candidate of the Democratic \nparty in municipal elections in Leland, Mississippi. \n \n  6.  Also on April 6, 2009, Defendant’s counsel sent by facsimile transmission to \nthe United States Department of Justice a Submission under Section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act, asking that the Department preclear the new rule.  Later that day, Defendant \n \n \n2\nW:\\26300_Dir\\26489\\ple-dist\\Resp-MotionStayProceedings.doc     \n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 17 Filed: 04/08/09 3 of 4 PageID #: 115\nfiled the instant motion, asking this Court to “stay this proceeding pending preclearance of \nthe Defendant’s submission to the Attorney General of the United States.” \n  A cursory review of these undisputed facts shows that Defendant’s motion is \ncompletely without merit.  While Defendant is perfectly free to attempt to change voting \npractices prospectively, it cannot change them retroactively.  Pursuant to the Voting Rights \nAct, no change in voting practices, standards or procedures can be made effective until \nthe change had been approved by the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia or, alternatively, precleared by the United States Attorney General.  See 42 \nU.S.C. §1973(c).   \n  Accordingly, even if the United States Attorney General ultimately preclears \nDefendant’s new rule, that rule can only be applied prospectively, after preclearance, and \ncan have no legal affect on the qualifications for certification that existed as of the \nqualifying deadline for the upcoming Leland Democratic Primary. \n  THIS, the 8th day of April, 2009. \n              JAMES W.

LOWE PLAINTIFF\nVS. CAUSE NO. 4:09-CV-00035-P-S  \nDEMOCRATIC MUNICIPAL EXECUTIVE\nCOMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF\nLELAND, MISSISSIPPI DEFENDANT\nAMENDED MOTION TO MODIFY INJUNCTION\nPURSUANT TO RULE 62( C ) F.R.C.P. \nCOMES NOW, the Democratic Municipal Executive Committee of the City of\nLeland, Mississippi, by and through counsel, and  files this Motion to Modify Injunction\nPursuant to Rule 62 F.R.C.P. and in support thereof states the following:\n1. On April 16, 2009, this Court entered a Judgment requiring the Defendant to\nplace the name of the Plaintiff on the May 5, 2009 primary election ballot forthwith.\n2. On April 21, 2009, the Defendant filed an appeal of this Court’s April 16,2009\nJudgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  \n3. That since this Court’s April 16, 2009 Judgment, the Defendant has learned\nthat Mississippi law bars the Plaintiff from seeking election to the position of Mayor of\nLeland in the May 5, 2009 primary election and that the Defendant is lawfully required to\nenforce said prohibition.\n4. Pursuant to the provisions of §23-15-171 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended)\n the Defendant shall perform the same duties as are specified by law and performed by\nmembers of the county executive committee with regard to county and state elections:\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 28 Filed: 04/24/09 2 of 7 PageID #: 279\n(1) Municipal primary elections shall be held on the first Tuesday in May\npreceding the general municipal election and, in the event a second primary\nshall be necessary, such second primary shall be held on the third Tuesday in\nMay preceding such general municipal election. At such primary election the\nmunicipal  executive  committee  shall  perform  the  same  duties  as  are\nspecified  by  law  and  performed  by  members  of  the  county  executive\ncommittee with regard to state and county primary elections. Each municipal\nexecutive committee shall have as many members as there are elective officers\nof the municipality, and such members of the municipal executive committee\nof each political party shall be elected in the primary elections held for the\nnomination of candidates for municipal offices. The provisions of this section\nshall govern all municipal primary elections as far as applicable, but the\nofficers to prepare the ballots and the managers and other officials of the\nprimary election shall be appointed by the municipal executive committee of\nthe party holding such primary, and the returns of such election shall be made\nto such municipal executive committee. Vacancies in the executive committee\nshall be filled by it.  \n§23-15-171 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended)(emphasis added).\n5. The provisions of § 23-15-217 Miss. Code Ann. (1972) include the\n following prohibition:\n(1) A commissioner of election of any county may be a candidate for\nany other office at any election held or to be held during the four-year\nterm for which he has been elected to the office of commissioner of\nelection or with reference to which he has acted as such; provided that\nhe has resigned from the office of election commissioner before\nJanuary 1 of the year in which he desires to seek the office. \n§ 23-15-217 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended)(emphasis added).  \n6. Prohibitions applicable to election commissioners qualifying for office have\nbeen applied to executive committee members by the Mississippi Supreme Court.  See\nBreland v. Mallett, 527 So.2d 629 (Miss. 1988).\n7. In Breland the Court concluded that the penalty clause of Section 23-15-217\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 28 Filed: 04/24/09 3 of 7 PageID #: 280\napplied to county executive committee members:\nAccordingly, this Court concludes that the penalty clause of the statute which\nprohibits a member of the Election Commission from being a candidate during the\nterm of their office as election commissioner equally applies to a person who was a\nmember of the Democratic Executive committee of Stone County, Mississippi.\nBreland v. Mallet, 527 So.2d 629 (Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended).\n8. In response to the decision, the Mississippi legislature amended the\nprovisions of § 23-15-263 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended) to specifically exempt\nmembers of county committees from the penalty of Section 23-15-217.  The amendment\nadded the following language:\nThe executive committee shall be subject to all the penalties to which county\nelection commissioners are subject, except that Section 23-15-217 shall not apply\nto members of the county executive committee who seek elective office. \n§ 23-15-263 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended).   There is no similar exemption\ncontained in §23-15-171 Miss. Code Ann.  (1972, as amended) for members of the\nmunicipal executive committee.\n9. The provisions of § 23-15-263(2) Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended)\nare distinguished from the provisions of the municipal committee statute by providing\nthat the county committee penalty for qualifying as a candidate, for state or county office, \nshall be automatic removal from office on the county executive committee.  The county\nexecutive committee statute further distinguishes itself from the municipal executive\ncommittee statute by providing that members of the county executive committee will not\nsuffer any penalty if they become a candidate in a municipal election: \nThe provisions of this subsection shall not apply to members of a\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 28 Filed: 04/24/09 4 of 7 PageID #: 281\nCounty Executive Committee who qualifies as a candidate for\nmunicipal elective office.\n§ 23-15-263(2) Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as amended).  There are no similar exemptions\ncontained in §23-15-171 Miss. Code Ann.  (1972, as amended) for members of the\nmunicipal executive committee.1\n10. The Plaintiff has admitted that he served as a member of the Republican\nMunicipal Executive Committee for the City of Leland until his resignation on March 2,\n2009.\n11. The Judgment of this Court entered on April 16, 2009 ordered that the\nDefendant add the Plaintiff’s name to the May 5, 2009 primary election ballot forthwith.\n12. Unless the Judgment of this Court is modified to allow the Defendant to bar\nthe Plaintiff from the May 5, 2009 ballot in accordance with the aforementioned\nMississippi law, the Defendant, and its members who may vote for the Plaintiff in the\nprimary election, will effectively be disenfranchised because the Plaintiff will not be\neligible to represent them in the general election.\n13. Rule 62( c) F.R.C.P. provides that, while an appeal from an injunction is\n1The Attorney General’s view regarding the statutory construction of the preceding\nsections differs from that of the Defendant.  See Op.Atty.Gen. Walker, August 15, 1990,\n1990 WL547925 (Miss. A.G.)   However, the Mississippi Supreme Court has also disagreed\nwith certain Attorney General’s opinions regarding significant aspects of election law and they\nhave had occasion to rule contrary to said opinions. See Meeks v. Tallahatchie County, 513 So.2d\n563, 568 (Miss. 1987).        \n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 28 Filed: 04/24/09 5 of 7 PageID #: 282\n pending, a District Court retains jurisdiction to suspend or modify the injunction.  Rule\n62 (c  ) F.R.C.P.\n14. The original intent of the Court’s April 16, 2009 Judgment was to insure\nthat the Plaintiff was not denied ballot placement based upon allegations of past\ndisloyalty.  The original judgment was never intended to bar the Defendant from\nexercising any other statutory authority under Mississippi’s  municipal election laws. \nModification of the April 16, 2009 Judgment will help insure that the purpose of the\noriginal judgment is achieved without exceeding the scope of the underlying case.  Sierra\nClub v. Cedar Point Oil Company, 73 F.3d 546 (5th Cir. 1996)(a Court may modify an\ninjunction to achieve the original purpose of the injunction if that purpose has not been\nfully achieved.)\n15. The injunction should be modified to permit the Defendant to discharge its\nduties and comply with the provisions of § 23-15-217 Miss. Code Ann. (1972, as\namended) and the related statutes.  \n16. The original injunction granted on April 16, 2009 was too broad and didn’t\ntake into account other factors which might bar the Plaintiff from being a candidate in the\nDemocratic Primary.  The Court should modify the injunction to allow the Defendant to\ncomply with Mississippi law.\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Defendant prays that this\nHonorable Court modify the April 16, 2009 Judgment to limit its application to\n\nCase: 4:09-cv-00035-WAP-JAD Doc #: 28 Filed: 04/24/09 6 of 7 PageID #: 283\nprohibiting the Defendant from removing the Plaintiff from the ballot for prior party\ndisloyalty.

      "text": "  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n  FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI \n  GREENVILLE DIVISION \n \nJAMES W. LOWE                PETITIONER \n \nVS.                CAUSE NO. 4:09CV035-P-S \n \nDEMOCRATIC MUNICIPAL EXECUTIVE \nCOMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF LELAND, \nMISSISSIPPI                DEFENDANT \n \n  JUDGMENT \n \n  THIS CAUSE was originally filed by the Petitioner Robert Lowe in the Circuit Court of \nWashington County, Mississippi in accordance with the provisions of Miss. Code Ann. Section 23-\n15-961 (4) as a Petition for Judicial Review of the Leland Democratic Executive Committee’s \ndecision to deny him certification as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the office of \nMayor of the City of Leland. \n  The  Respondent,  Democratic  Municipal  Executive  Committee  of  the  City  of  Leland \n(hereinafter the Executive Committee), removed the action to federal court on the basis that the \npetition asserted, inter alia, a violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, thereby \ninvoking federal jurisdiction pursuant to Title 28 USC Section 1331, 1343 and 1443.   In addition to \nanswering Lowe’s petition, the Executive Committee also filed a motion for interim relief pursuant to \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 and a motion to stay proceeding pending preclearance decision.   \n  On April 9, 2009, the Court convened a hearing in this matter pursuant to Rule 65 F.R.C.P. \nand/or the provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §23-15-961(4).  Prior to the hearing, the Executive \nCommittee requested a ruling on its motion to stay the instant proceeding pending preclearance.  The \nCourt found that said motion was not well taken and denied same.    \n  The Court then conducted an evidentiary hearing and received live testimony, documentary \nevidence and stipulations of the parties.   At the conclusion of the proof, the Court entertained oral \nargument and recessed the proceeding to consider its ruling. \n  After due consideration, the Court rendered a bench opinion, which is attached as Exhibit 1 \n\nhereto and incorporated by reference herein.  In accordance with the Court’s bench opinion, the \nCourt finds as follows: \n  1.  That the Court has jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter. \n \n  2.  That this is a proceeding for injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 65 F.R.C.P. \n \n  3.  That the parties stipulated that Lowe meets the statutory requirements contained at \nMiss Code Ann. Section 23-15-309 to qualify as a candidate for the office of Mayor \nin the City of Leland, Mississippi Democratic primary election. \n \n  4.  That the parties stipulated that the Chairman of the Executive Committee would \ntestify that based upon the evidence before them, and based upon the evidence \npresented to this Court, the Executive Committee would not want to be associated \nwith Mr. Lowe as a candidate because they believe he failed to conform to the \nconcepts,  ideas  goals,  and  candidacies  of  the  Democratic  Party.    His  stipulated \ntestimony would also be that the Executive Committee believes that, despite Mr. \nLowe’s representations to the Court, he will not support the Democratic primary \ncandidates for office in this election cycle in the City of Leland, Mississippi. \n \n  5.  That Mr. Lowe testified that he would support the party nominee in the upcoming \nelection.  A prospective loyalty oath is the sole requirement for compliance with Miss \nCode Ann. Section 23-15-575.  \n \n 6.    That under Miss. Code Ann. §23-15-309, party loyalty is not a recognized criterion \nfor purposes of qualifying Lowe as a candidate for Mayor in the upcoming election.    \n \n  7.  That Miss. Code Ann. Section 23-15-575, as applied in this case, does not violate the \nExecutive Committee’s right to freedom of association under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution or Article III, Sections 11 and 13 of \nthe Mississippi Constitution of 1890.   \n \n  8.  That Miss. Code Ann.  Section 23-15-309, as applied in this case, does not violate the \nExecutive Committee’s right to freedom of association under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution or Article III, Sections 11 and 13 of \nthe Mississippi Constitution of 1890. \n   \n  9.  That the Executive Committee’s claim that placement of Lowe’s name on the ballot \nas a Democratic candidate for Mayor is repugnant to the principles of free association \nrecognized by the First and Fourteenth Amendments is rejected. \n \n  10.  That the  placement of Lowe’s name on the Democratic Party’s primary ballot as a \nstatutorily qualified candidate does not place a significant burden on the Democratic \nParty’s  “freedom  to  select  a  standard  bearer  who  best  represents  the  party’s \nideologies and preferences” and it’s right to “broaden the base of public participation \nin and support for its activities.”    \n \n  11.  That the State’s interest in affording its citizens broad participation in the political \nprocess is sufficient to uphold the statutory procedure in question. \n \n\n  12.  That the Executive Committee exceeded its statutory authority in refusing to qualify \nLowe as a Democratic Party candidate for the office of Mayor. \n \n  13.  That the Executive Committee’s recently adopted Rule Regarding Qualification of \nCandidates did not exist on either March 6, 2009, the date on which Lowe filed his \nqualifying papers or on March 17, 2009, the date on which the Executive Committee \nvoted to deny Lowe certification on grounds of party disloyalty. \n \n14.  That the Rule Regarding Qualification of Candidates has not been precleared and this \nCourt lacks the authority to grant interim relief based upon said rule. \n \n  15.  That  the  recently  adopted  Rule  Regarding  Qualification  of  Candidates  is \nunenforceable and therefore does not create a cognizable conflict with state election \nlaw and the Executive Committee’s First and Fourteenth Amendment arguments \nstemming therefrom are not justicable at this time. \n \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED and ADJUDGED as follows: \n  A.  Defendant’s  Motion  to  Stay  Proceedings  Pending  Preclearance  is  hereby \ndenied. \n \n  B.  Petitioner’s request for injunctive relief requiring the Defendant to \n      place the Petitioner on the ballot for the May 5, 2009 Leland Municipal \n      Democratic Primary Election is well taken, is hereby granted, and Defendant \nis ordered to do so forthwith. \n \n  C.  Defendant’s Motion for Interim Relief pursuant to the Voting Rights \n      Act of 1965 is not well taken and is hereby denied. \n \n  D.  Defendant’s ore tenus Motion for Stay pending appeal to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is hereby denied. \n \n  SO ORDERED, this the 16th day of April, 2009. \n \n \n              /s/ W. Allen Pepper, Jr.                              \n              W. ALLEN PEPPER, JR. \n              UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nAPPROVED AS TO FORM: \n \ns/ANDREW N. ALEXANDER III   \nAndrew N.
