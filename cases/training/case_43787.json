Defendants included the Lone Star College System District and the members of The Board of Trustees of the Lone Star College System. Represented by private counsel, the Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because the at-large electoral system in place at the time diluted the voting strength of minority populations and had the effect of preventing African-American and Latino citizens from electing and retaining the candidates of their choice. The Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against further use of the at-large electoral system. The case was assigned to Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt.</p>\r\n<p>On October 11, 2013, the Court issued a Consent Judgment and Decree that provided the following: (i) the Defendants are permanently enjoined from conducting any elections under the existing at-large election plan, and (ii) for the then-scheduled November 4, 2014 election and all elections going forward, the Defendant was to employ a nine single-member district election plan. The Court also awarded the Plaintiffs attorney fees of $50,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of October 2023, there were no further developments.</p>",

Lone Star College System is the fastest growing college or university in Texas \nbased on enrollment.  \n2.  Nearly a majority of Lone Star College Systemโs students are minority. \n3.  There are significant numbers of African-American and Latino citizens in the \ndistrict that live geographically close to one another, for example in the Acres \nHomes and Aldine Communities. \n4.  Lone  Star  College  System  has  one  of  the  largest,  if  not  the  largest,  student \nenrollments of any college or university in Texas, even considering Texas A & M, \nthe University of Houston and the University of Texas at Austin. \n5.  The Lone Star College System Board has nine members who are elected at-large. \n6.  Despite  large  numbers  of  Latino  citizens  residing  in  the  district,  no  Latino \ncandidate has ever been elected to the Board. \n7.  Despite large numbers of African-American citizens residing in the district, few \nAfrican-American  candidates  have  been  elected  to  the  Board.    Recently,  the \nAfrican-American  Board  Chair  was  defeated  in  the  election  where  an  Anglo \nsupported candidate prevailed. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:13-cv-01635   Document 1   Filed on 06/04/13 in TXSD   Page 3 of 11\n \n8.  The at-large election scheme, as opposed to a single member district system, has \nthe effect of preventing African-American and Latino citizens from electing and \nretaining the candidates of their choice.   \n9.  The at-large election scheme was developed with the purpose, and has the effect, \nof minimizing and reducing the voting strength of minority populations in the \nLone Star College System voting area.   \n10.  Plaintiffs, as minority residents and citizens of the Lone Star College System, \nbring this suit, under the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws, in order to \nestablish  a  single-member  election  district  system  in  the  Lone  Star  College \nSystem. \nII. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343, 1357, and 2284; \nand pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1973 & 1973j(f).  Plaintiffsโ action for declaratory \nand injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202, and 2284, as well \nas by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Venue is proper \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1391(b).   \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:13-cv-01635   Document 1   Filed on 06/04/13 in TXSD   Page 4 of 11\n \nIII.  \nPARTIES \n12.

I, Sec. 2, Cl. 3, a federal census is \nperformed.   \n26.  The latest census figures demonstrate the total population within the Lone Star \nCollege  System  is  1,780,850  of  which  32%  are  Latino,  16%  are  African-\nAmerican, and 46.1% are Anglo. \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:13-cv-01635   Document 1   Filed on 06/04/13 in TXSD   Page 7 of 11\n \n27.  The Lone Star College System has a greater population than 12 entire states and \nthe District of Columbia. \n28.  If the Lone Star College System were a city, it would be the 5th largest city in the \nUnited States. \n29.  The Lone Star College System has a total 2011 student enrollment of 75,680 \nstudents.  Forty-seven percent (47%) of Defendant, Lone Star Collegeโs student \nenrollment is made up of minority students.    \n30.  The Lone Star College System student population has grown approximately 58% \nin the last five years. \n31.  The  voting  population  in  the  Lone  Star  College  System  is  highly  racially \npolarized.   \n32.  The  African-American  citizen  voting  population  is  sufficiently  large  and \ngeographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district. \n33.  The  Latino  citizen  voting  population  sufficiently  large  and  geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district. \n34.  The Latino citizen voting population is politically cohesive. \n35.  The African-American citizen voting population is politically cohesive. \n36.  The Anglo majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it - in the absence of \nspecial circumstances - usually to defeat the minorityโs preferred candidate or \nmeasure. \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:13-cv-01635   Document 1   Filed on 06/04/13 in TXSD   Page 8 of 11\n \n37.  There is a lack of proportional representation by minority supported candidates. \n38.  Plaintiffs can prove they are entitled to relief under a โtotality of circumstancesโ \nutilizing the factors the Supreme Court has laid out in Village of Arlington Heights \nv. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp, 429 U.S. 252 (1977)). \nV. \n \nCLAIMS \n \nCount 1 \n \n39.  Plaintiffs reallege the facts set forth above. \n  \n40.  The Lone Star College Systemโs at-large voting scheme (the Plan) violates Section \n2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973, in that, under the totality of the \ncircumstances, Plaintiffs and minority voters are denied an equal opportunity to \nparticipate  effectively  in  the  political  process  and  to  elect  candidates  of  their \nchoice to the Board of Trustees.  The Plan also violates Section 2 of the Voting \nRights  Act,  42  U.S.C.  ยง1973,  because,  under  the  totality  of  circumstances, \nPlaintiffs  and  minority  voters  are  denied  an  equal  opportunity  to  participate \neffectively  in  the  political  process  and  to  have  any  meaningful  or  significant \ninfluence in elections for Members of the Board of Trustees.  \nCount 2 \n \n41.  Plaintiffs reallege the facts set forth above. \n  \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:13-cv-01635   Document 1   Filed on 06/04/13 in TXSD   Page 9 of 11\n \n42.  The Plan violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution because it intentionally discriminates against Latino \nand African-American persons by denying Plaintiffs and these voters an equal \nopportunity  to  participate  in  the  political  process,  to  elect  candidates  of  their \nchoice  to  the  Board  of  Trustees,  and  to  have  any  meaningful  or  significant \ninfluence in elections for members of the Board of Trustees. \nVI.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court:  \n1.  Assume jurisdiction of this action.  \n  \n2.  Issue a declaratory judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202 and Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure Rule 57, declaring that the at-large election scheme for \nBoard of Trustees of Lone Star College System: (1) dilutes the voting strength of \nminority voters (African-American and Latinos) in violation of Section 2 of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1973, and in violation of the \nEqual Protection Clause; (2) is an unconstitutional election system in violation of \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article \nI of the United States Constitution; and (3) cannot be administered in elections any \nlonger. \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:13-cv-01635   Document 1   Filed on 06/04/13 in TXSD   Page 10 of 11\n \n3.  Issue  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  enjoining  the  Defendants,  their \nagents, employees, and those persons acting in concert with them, from enforcing \nor giving any effect to an at-large election system, including enjoining Defendants \nfrom conducting any elections for the Board of Trustees for Lone Star College \nSystem utilizing the Plan.  \n4.  Issue  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  requiring  the  Defendants,  their \nagents, employees, and those persons acting in concert with them, to call and hold \nan election for all nine trustee positions, at the earliest available uniform election \ndate under state law, utilizing a lawful and constitutional single member district \nelection map. \n5.  Make all further orders as are  just, necessary, and proper  to ensure complete \ncompliance with this Courtโs Declaratory and injunctive orders in this case. \n6.  Issue  an  order  requiring  Defendants  to  pay  Plaintiffsโ  costs,  expenses  and \nreasonable attorneysโ fees incurred in the prosecution of this action, as authorized \nby the Civil Rights Attorneysโ Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988  \n7.
