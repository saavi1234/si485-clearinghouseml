    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit is about Hale County, Texas&rsquo;s alleged failure to allow voters with limited English proficiency to get assistance while voting.</p>\r\n<p>On February 27, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against Hale County, Texas in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Plaintiff alleged that Defendant (1) failed to allow English-limited and Spanish-speaking voters assistance from the person of their choice and failed to train poll workers to allow such assistance, and (2) failed to effectively provide Spanish-language election-related materials and information to English-limited, Spanish-speaking voters.&nbsp;Plaintiff sought declaratory judgment that Defendant violated sections 203 and 208 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1973aa-6 and 1973aa-1a(c) and an injunction against continued violations.</p>\r\n<p>In a Three-Judge Court, judges Sam R. Cummings (N.D. Texas), Jerry E. Smith (5th Circuit), and Mary Lou Robinson (N.D. Texas) presided over this case.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;On April 27, 2006, the court entered a consent decree. Via the Consent Decree, Defendant admitted to failing to fully comply with sections 203 and 208 of the Voting Rights Act and agreed to &ldquo;ensure that Spanish-speaking voters with limited English-speaking proficiency are permitted assistance from persons of the voter&rsquo;s choice,&rdquo; that all election-related information that the county disseminates in English will also be equally available in Spanish, that polling places will have Spanish-language assistance available, including election-officials who understand and can speak Spanish fluently, to train poll workers on the requirements of sections 203 and 208 of the Voting Rights Act, and to develop and maintain a bilingual election program. Consent Decree, <em>United States v. Hale County, Texas</em>, No. 5:06-cv-00043 (N.D. Texas Apr. 27, 2006).</p>\r\n<p>On December 17, 2009, Plaintiff filed a notice to inform the court that it would not seek to extend the consent decree.

    "summary_short": "In 2006, the United States filed this lawsuit against Hale County, Texas in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The United States alleged that Hale County failed to allow Spanish-speaking voters with limited English proficiency to obtain assistance from a person of their choice and failed to provide election-related materials in Spanish, in violation of Sections 208 and 203 of the Voting Rights Act, respectively. The parties resolved these allegations via a Consent Decree which permanently enjoined Hale County from continuing to violate the Voting Rights Act and required the county to implement procedures that would safeguard Spanish-speakers’ rights under the act. Finding that Hale County no longer needed supervision provided for by the Consent Decree, the United States allowed it to expire on December 31, 2009.",
